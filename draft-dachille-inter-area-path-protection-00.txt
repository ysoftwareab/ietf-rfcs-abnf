               Abstract  
                
                  This document describes a mechanism to establish end-to-end disjoint 
                  LSPs in a multiple area domain, as required for inter-area end-to-end 
                  protection. 
                  This mechanism relies on the joint computation of the working and 
                  backup LSPs segments in each area. 
                  A new RSVP-TE object called the Associated Route Object, ARO, is 
                  defined and used in the signaling messages in support of this scheme.

               1. Introduction 
                     
                  End-to-end protection in a MPLS network requires the establishment of 
                  two disjoint LSPs, a working LSP and a backup LSP, and the adoption 
                  of a notification mechanism to inform the head-end of a fault on the 
                  working path so that it may switch the traffic onto the backup LSP. 
                    In this document we assume that the two LSP must be node-disjoint. 
                  Extensions to handle different disjointedness constraints (e.g. link- 
                  or SRLG-disjoint paths) are left for further development of this 
                  draft.  
                    The main problem we address here is the joint and distributed 
                  computation of the working and backup paths in a multi-area network, 
                  where each node has limited knowledge of the network topology. The 
                  reference network model is described in Section 2. 
                  A solution to this problem has been previously proposed  in [EXCLUDE-
                  ROUTE], where a new RSVP-TE object, the XRO, is introduced. 
                    In Section 3 we review this proposal, highlighting some of its 
                  limitations. 
                    In section 4 we propose an alternative approach, based on the joint 
                  computation of the two paths in a distributed manner, which overcomes 
                  the above mentioned limitations. We also introduce a new RSVP-TE 
                  object alternative to the XRO in support of our scheme, and call it 
                  the Associated Route Object (ARO). 
                    Finally, in Section 5 we briefely discuss some points for further 
                  development of the proposed scheme. 
                   
                     
               2. Network Model 
                     
                    We assume that the network can be modeled as a conglomerate of 
                  interconnected sub-domains, hereafter called ôareasö. Within each 
                  area we distinguish between border nodes and internal nodes. A border 
                  node is placed at the boundary of one or more areas, while an 
                  internal node is completely embedded within a single area. Note that 
                  an area might include only border nodes, with no internal nodes. We 
                  assume that while each border node has complete knowledge of the 
                  intra-area topology, it has only a summarized view of the inter-area 
                  connectivity. That is, while each border node knows about of the  
                  nodes and links included in the area(s) that it is connected to, 
                  along with their associated TE attributes (e.g. available capacity, 
                  degree of reliability), it only has an inter-area connectivity map, 
                  similar to the information that BGP already distributes at inter-AS 
                  level.  
                    As a working hypothesis, we will assume that every inter-area 
                  connection  is  duplicated.  In  other  words,  it  is  realized  by 
                  interconnecting at least two different border nodes on each side. 
                  This assumption is required to enforce  node-disjointedness,  and

                  corresponds to the usual way in which inter-AS connections are 
                  arranged in pratice. 
                    Any possible extensions to this scheme to cope with a network where 
                  the duplicated inter-area connection hypothesis does not apply are 
                  considered as a point for further studies. 
                    In the rest of this draft, we will assume a MPLS control plane 
                  [MPLS], involving RSVP-TE signaling and OSPF-TE/ISIS-TE intra-domain 
                  routing. However the proposal here can be easily extended to a GMPLS 
                  control plane, as needed for instance in case of optical networks. 
                    Within the assumptions made above, the concepts and mechanisms 
                  proposed here could apply to several scenarios. For example, the term 
                  of ôareaö might refer to an: 
                   
                  - OSPF area, in case we are implementing TE in a large multi-area IGP 
                     domain. In this case, the inter-area routing protocol is still the 
                     OSPF-TE. The same applies to ISIS-TE; 
                  - Autonomous System (AS), in case we are implementing TE in a      
                     multi-AS context; in this case, the inter-area routing protocol is 
                     BGP or BGP with its Traffic Engineering extensions;   
                  - Optical island, in case we are implementing TE in an optical 
                     network, composed of several inter-connected optical islands. In 
                     this case, the message definitions and processing given in section 
                     4 would need to be adapted for a GMPLS control plane. This point 
                     has been left for further development.  
                   
                
               3. Previous Proposal: The Iterated Shortest-Path Approach (ISPA)  
                
                    A first solution to the problem of distributed establishment of 
                  disjoint LSP was proposed in [EXCLUDE-ROUTE], which utilized a RSVP-
                  TE object called XRO (eXclude Route Object) introduced in the same 
                  document. We will refer to such a method as the ôiterated shortest-
                  path  approachö  (ISPA).  In  this  section,  we  provide  a  brief 
                  description of the ISPA approach and outline some of its limitations. 
                   
                   
               3.1. High-Level Description 
                
                    The ISPA foresees two steps, which we describe in the following 
                  with reference to the exemplary network in Fig. 1, where a protected 
                  LSP from node A to node H must be installed: 
                               
                    - Step 1: The working LSP is setup along the shortest end-to-end 
                               path, which is computed in a distributed manner through 
                               ERO expansion (see [EXCLUDE-ROUTE]). During the setup 
                               signaling procedure, each node along P1 must process the  
                               PATH message as described in [RSVP] and [RSVP-TE]. With 
                               reference to the sample network in Fig. 1, the actions 
                               realizing this step are as follows:

                               -Step 1a: Node A computes the segment of P1 through area 
                                         1 and initiates the signaling procedure to 
                                         install it;  
                               -Step 1b: PATH message arrives at node C, and node C 
                                         computes the segment of P1 through area 2, 
                                         which is done via ERO expansion, and continues 
                                         the signaling procedure; 
                               -Step 1c: Same as step 1b, but node E and area 3 are 
                                         involved; 
                               -Step 1d: PATH message arrives at node H, which sends 
                                         back to node A the RESV message to allocate 
                                         P1, as described in [RSVP] and [RSVP-TE]. 
                                         Through the RRO included in the RESV message, 
                                         node A becomes aware of exactly which nodes 
                                         are included in P1; 
                   
                    - Step 2: Node A computes the backup path P2 with the additional 
                               constraint of excluding all nodes that were included in 
                               P1. These nodes are later included in the XRO object of 
                               the PATH message that is sent along P2. With reference 
                               to the examplary network in Fig. 1, this step is 
                               particularized as follows: 
                   
                              -Step 2a: Node A computes the segment of P2 through area 
                                        1, pruning node C from the topology, and starts 
                                        the signaling procedure to install it;  
                              -Step 2b: PATH message arrives at node D, and node D 
                                        computes the segment of P2 through area 2 
                                        through ERO expansion, by first pruning nodes C 
                                        and E, and next node D continues the signaling 
                                        procedure; 
                              -Step 2c: Same as step 2b, but node F now computes the 
                                        segment of P2 through area 3; 
                              -Step 2d: Same as step 1d;

               3.2. Limitations of the Iterated Shortest-Path Approach (ISPA) 
                      
                    The ISPA has two main limitations: 
                   
                    - Trapping 
                    - Sub-optimal route selection 
                   
                    In this section we briefly discuss these problems.  
                    The trapping problem is described in [DOVERSPIKE] and in [TRAP-
                  AVOID]; it arises whenever a trap topology is present in the network. 
                  Fig. 2 shows a network that is subject to trapping problem.

                                                 Fig.2 
                                                    
                
                    In this example we consider a network consisting of three areas, 
                  namely area 1 (nodes A,B,C,D), area 2 (nodes C,D,E,F), and area 3 
                  (nodes E,F,G,H), as depicted in Fig. 2. We suppose that node A 
                  requests two node-disjoint paths between itself and node H and we 
                  assume that every link has the same cost, say X; in this scenario, in 
                  the first step, path A-C-F-H will be selected as the working path. 
                  After pruning nodes C and F from the topology (in ISPA this is done 
                  by adding them to the XRO), however, it is no longer possible to find 
                  another path between A and H (even though two node-disjoint paths 
                  from node A to node H do exist in this setting). In [TRAP-AVOID] is 
                  stated that this problem may occur with a probability as high as 30% 
                  in a typical mesh network when node-disjoint paths are required. 
                    JSA overcomes this limitation, because the working and the backup 
                  paths are computed jointly. Thus, if the backup path shares a node 
                  with the working one, both are modified to avoid trapping. In this 
                  example, the paths JSA would find are: A-B-D-F-H as the working path 
                  and A-C-E-G-H as the backup path. 
                     
                    The second limitation is that the ISPA may lead to sub-optimal path 
                  selection. That is, once the working path is selected at a minimum 
                  cost, the backup path has to be selected at a cost greater than the 
                  one obtainable with a joint computation of the two paths; we discuss 
                  this in the context of the exemplary network in Fig. 3, where the 
                  numbers over each link represent its weight.

                    If ISPA is adopted to compute two node-disjoint paths, node A will 
                  choose A-C-F-H as the working path, and A-B-D-E-G-H as the backup 
                  one; the costs are 6 for the working path and 20 for the backup one. 
                  If JSA is adopted instead, node A will choose A-C-E-G-H as the 
                  working path and A-B-D-F-H as the backup one, with a cost of 10 for 
                  the working path and 13 for the backup one. The difference here is 
                  that while the first approach selects the shortest possible working 
                  path, it can lead to situations where the backup path has a high 
                  cost. On the other hand, the second approach selects them with the 
                  constraint that both must be the shortest possible, obtaining a more 
                  balanced result.  
                    Both limitations were already mentioned in [VASSEUR], which 
                  proposed as an alternative the joint selection of the working and 
                  backup paths in a centralized route server. 
                    In the following, we propose a different approch, where the joint 
                  selection of disjoint paths is done in a distributed manner. 
                   
                      
               4. A Novel Proposal: The Joint Selection approach (JSA) 
                
                    Here we propose a novel scheme, called ôJoint Selection Approachö, 
                  based on the joint selection of both working and backup LSPs. This  
                  mechanism  assumes  that a disjoint route selection algorithm is 
                  implemented in the border nodes, such as for example the Suurballe 
                  algorithm [SUURBALLE] or the Bhandari algorithm [BHANDARI] or one of 
                  their extensions.  
                    Similarly to ISPA, also in JSA the two LSP are installed in two                                                     
                  separate     steps.     However, differently from ISPA, the route

               draft-dachille-inter-area-path-protection-00.txt          January 2004
                                                   
                  selection of both LSPs is done jointly in the first phase. While the 
                  path of the first LSP - that is, the one being installed during the 
                  first phase - is included in the ERO, the route of the second LSP - 
                  which will be installed in the second phase û will be collected in 
                  the ARO during the first phase itself. At the end of the first phase, 
                  the ARO collecting the e2e route of the second LSP is returned to the 
                  head-end node, which can then install it as an ER-LSP. 
                    Next we will provide a detailed description of the JSA operation. 
                  For sake of simplicity, we will first consider a special case, where 
                  the inter-area connectivity is linear, therefore the inter-area path 
                  for both LSP is fixed. Then, in section 4.2, we will describe the JSA 
                  mechanism in the case of general mesh inter-area connectivity. The 
                  difference between the two cases is that in the linear topology the 
                  inter-area routes for both LSP are the same, so that full ARO 
                  expansion occurs. Instead, in the more general case, the inter-area 
                  routes  of  the  two  LSP  may  be  partially  (and  not  completely) 
                  overlapping, requiring partial ARO expansion. 
                    In the following we will assume that every border router, say B1, 
                  that  is  directly  attached  to  area  X  maintains  a  summarized 
                  topological view consisting of the exact intra-area topology of X 
                  plus several so called ôvirtual linksö. Virtual link are present 
                  between the border routers of area X, say B2 B3 etc., and the 
                  possible destinations: they merely represent external paths to remote 
                  destinations that are reachable through some inter-area path. Virtual 
                  link might be assigned a cost (see section 5). As an example, Fig. 
                  4a, 4b, and 4c report the topological views of border nodes in the 
                  sample network of Fig. 1.

               4.1. Linear inter-area topology 
                
                    Here we assume that inter-area connectivity between source and 
                  destination is linear (as example, see Fig. 1). Note that the case of 
                  a multi-area OSPF network falls in this case; in fact, OSPF areas are 
                  organized in a star topology, with a central area 0, the backbone, 
                  and all other areas connected to it. If we assume that each 
                  destination is connected to a single area, we can exclude stub areas 
                  that do not include source nor destination, so we end up with a chain 
                  of length 3. 
                    We will describe JSA in this case with reference to the topology 
                  shown in Fig. 1. Suppose that node A requests two node-disjoint LSP 
                  between nodes A and H; JSA foresees two steps: 
                   
                  -Step 1: Joint and distributed computation of the two LSPs and 
                             installation of the first one. This step is divided in the 
                             following phases: 
                   
                    - Step 1a: Node A MUST compute two node-disjoint paths between 
                               itself and H, based on the virtual topology shown in 
                               Fig.  4a.  This  computation  is  performed  through  a 
                               disjoint route selection algorithm, e.g. [SUURBALLE] and 
                               [BHANDARI]. In this example the computed paths are A-C 
                               and A-B-D, which are LSP segments in area 1(one of which 
                               will form a segment of the first LSP while the other 
                               will form a segment of the second LSP). _ 
                    - Step 1b: Node A start the signaling procedure to establish the 
                               first LSP, for example A-C; the PATH message sent by 
                               node A includes, among the others, these objects: 
                   
                              -ERO specifying the route C(Strict)-A2(Loose)-A3(Loose)-
                                    H(Loose). A2 and A3 are Area.ID of area 2 and 3, 
                                    see section 4.3; 
                              -ARO specifying the route A-B-D-A2-A3, while the tail-end 
                                   node will be added later; 
                    - Step 1c: Node C receives PATH message and computes two node-
                                disjoint paths between nodes A and H, based on the 
                                virtual topology shown in Fig. 4b. In this way, node C 
                                obtains the LSP segments in area 2. This computation is 
                                triggered by the presence of an ARO in the PATH message 
                                and by the fact that node H does not belong to area 2;  
                    - Step 1d: Node C performs ARO and ERO expansion and continues the 
                                signaling procedure; the PATH message sent by node C 
                                includes, among the others, these objects:

                                -ERO specifying the route E(Strict)-A3(Loose)-H(Loose);  
                                -ARO specifying the route A-B-D-F-A3, since A2 has been 
                                      expanded to the route(D-F) through area 2; 
                     
                    - Step 1e: As in step 1c, but the border node involved is E and the 
                                virtual topology used is the one shown in Fig. 4c, and 
                                then step 1d is performed by node E; PATH message sent 
                                by node E toward node H includes, among the others, 
                                these objects: 
                   
                                -ERO specifying the route G(Strict)-H(Strict) and  
                                -ARO specifying the route A-B-D-F-H; the tail-end node 
                                      H is added by E, i.e. the first border node 
                                      connected to tail-end area; 
                     
                    - Step 1f: Upon receiving the PATH message, node H sends back a 
                                RESV message  along the first path to install that 
                                path. The ARO is copied into the RESV to communicate 
                                the second route to node A. The first  step thus ends 
                                with the establishment of the first LSP; note that here 
                                ARO expansion had to be performed in every area; 
                   
                  -Step 2: Establishment of the second LSP computed in the first step; 
                            this step is divided into the following phases: 
                   
                    - Step 2a: Node A starts the signaling procedure to establish the 
                                second LSP by sending a PATH message towards node H; 
                                the ERO object contained in PATH now includes all the 
                                nodes described in the ARO (see step 1), marked as 
                                Strict. Thus the second LSP will be installed as an ER-
                                LSP. 
                
                    - Step 2b: Nodes B,D, and F forward the PATH message along the 
                                 route described in ERO; 
                
                    - Step 2c: The PATH message arrives at the tail-end node H, which 
                                 sends back RESV message to establish the second LSP; 
                   
                    - Step 2d: The RESV message arrives at node A, establishing the 
                                second LSP; from this moment on, node A can begin  
                                generating traffic along one of the LSPs (i.e. the 
                                working one). If the second LSP cannot be established, 
                                the first LSP must be torn down; 
                   
                     
                    If one of these steps is unsuccessful, a PATH-ERR message will be 
                  sent back and the entire procedure must be restarted, with a maximum 
                  of N tries (parameter N may be optimized to minimize signaling 
                  overhead on the network).

               4.2. General Inter-area Mesh Topology 
                
                    In this section we will describe JSA operations on a generally 
                  inter-area mesh topology, in particular we will refer to the network 
                  shown in Fig. 5, which can model a multi-AS network.  
                    We assume that the head-end node A requests two node-disjoint LSPs 
                  towards the tail-end node B; JSA minimizes the number of areas that 
                  the two LSPs share, and if two area-disjoint paths are present in the 
                  network, JSA can compute them; however the two LSPs will necessarily 
                  share head-end and tail-end areas, so the minimum number of areas 
                  that the two LSPs share, in a generic topology, is 2. We now describe 
                  JSA with reference to Fig. 5, assuming that A computes the following 
                  inter-area routes for the two  LSP: A1-A4-A5-A6 and A1-A2-A5-A6. The 
                  JSA mechanism proceeds as follows: 
                   
                   
                  -Step 1:  Joint and distributed computation of the two LSPs and setup 
                              of the first one. This step is performed in the following 
                              phases: 
                   
                    - Step 1a: Node A computes two disjoint paths between itself and B, 
                               within area 1, with a inter-area topological view as 
                               shown in Fig. 5b; in this case, node A MUST prune all 
                               the border nodes, except one for every area connected to 
                               area 1, before the disjoint route selection algorithm is 
                               performed; as a result, the two LSPs will not cross the 
                               same next area, and will follow the computed inter-area 
                               path. Assume that nodes B2 and B4 are pruned. Pruning 
                               MUST NOT be performed if area 1 has only one neighbour 
                               area. 
                  ________ 
                    - Step 1b: Node A starts the signaling procedure, sending the PATH 
                               message along the first LSP, for example through areas 
                               1-4-5-6, including the objects: 
                   
                               -ERO specifying all the nodes between node A and node 
                                    B3,   marked   as   Strict,   A4(Loose)-A5(Loose)-
                                    A6(Loose)-node B(Loose); 
                               -ARO specifying all the nodes between node A and node 
                                    B1, then A2, A5, A6. A2, A5, and A6 are the 
                                    Area.IDs, described in Section 4.3, of the second 
                                    LSP inter-area route; 
                     
                    - Step 1c: Upon receiving the PATH message, node B3 controls if A4 
                               (ID of area 4, through which B is reachable) is included 
                               in ARO; it is not, then only first LSP crosses area 4; 
                               node B3 performs an ERO expansion, as described in 
                               [EXCLUDE-ROUTE], while ARO is not be processed, and then 
                               B3 continues the signaling procedure. Assume that nodes 
                               B3 and B6 are chosen as edge nodes of the segment of the 
                               first LSP through area 4 by the disjoint route selection 
                               algorithm performed by node B3;

                    - Step 1d: Node B6 controls if A5 is included in ARO; it is, then 
                               the two LSP must share area 5. Node B6 MUST perform the 
                               disjoint route selection algorithm, since the two LSPs 
                               MUST be node-disjoint in area 5. In this computation 
                               node B6 MUST prune node B5 from topology, since B6 is 
                               the last node of the segment of the first LSP in area 4, 
                               and must be the first node of the segment of the first 
                               LSP in area 5 (see Fig. 5c). Assume that nodes B6 and 
                               B10 are chosen as edge nodes of the segment of the first 
                               LSP through area 5 by the disjoint route selection 
                               algorithm, and that nodes B7 and B9 as edge node of the 
                               segment of the second LSP through the same area. 
                     
                    - Step 1e: Node B6 continues the signaling procedure, sending a 
                              PATH message to node B10 containing these objects: 
                     
                     
                              -ERO specifying all the nodes between node B6 and node 
                                   B10,  marked  as  Strict,  A6(Loose)-B(Loose).  This 
                                   route has been obtained through ERO expansion; 
                               
                              -ARO specifying all the nodes between nodes A and B1, A2, 
                                   all the nodes between B7 and B9, then A6. Here A5 
                                   has been expanded to obtain the second LSP route 
                                   through area 5 (ARO expansion); 
                     
                    - Step 1f: A6 is included in ARO, so node B10 must perform the 
                               disjoint  route  selection  algorithm,  based  on  the 
                               topology shown in Fig. 5d and perform ERO and ARO 
                               expansion as described in steps 1d and 1e.  
                       
                    - Step 1g: Node B sends RESV message to install the first LSP, 
                              copying the ARO in it, so A will become aware of the 
                              route of the second LSP. This ends the first step. 
                   
                  -Step 2: Establishment of the second LSP computed in step 1. This 
                            step is divided in the following phases: 
                   
                    -Step 2a: Node A starts the signaling procedure to install the 
                             second LSP, sending a PATH message including the ERO 
                             specifying the route obtained by node A via the ARO it 
                             received as part of the RESV message at the end of Step 1; 
                             all nodes are marked as Strict, while Area.ID are 
                             substituted by type 32 Loose sub-objects (see [RSVP-TE]); 
                     
                    - Step 2b: The second LSP is established as described in [EXCLUDE-
                              ROUTE], with the usual ERO expansion.

                    This is a novel RSVP-TE object used in JSA. 
                   
                   
               4.3.1. ARO Semantics and format     
                
                    The route of the backup path associated to a working path is 
                  advertised by means of the Associated Route Object (ARO). Class value 
                  and C_Type value are [TBD]. The ARO Object has the following format 
                  (Fig. 6a): 
                      
                      
                   0                   1                   2                   3     
                                                                                     
                   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1   
                  -----------------------------------------------------------------  
                  |                                                               |  
                  //                        SUB-OBJECTS                           // 
                  |                                                               |  
                  ----------------------------------------------------------------- 
                   
                      
                                                Fig. 6a 
                
                      
                    It is easy to notice that this format is very similar to that of 
                  ERO object [RSVP-TE]. Indeed it is in fact the same, except for Class 
                  and C_Type. We can think of this object as playing the role of the 
                  ôfuture ERO of the backup pathö, and this explains why it is so 
                  similar to the ERO object. 
                    As happens with ERO, the sub-objects represent an abstract node, 
                  i.e. a group of real nodes, which may consist even of a single 
                  physical node (this concept is well described in [RSVP-TE]).  
                      
                      
               4.3.2. ARO Sub-Objects 
                
                    The ARO object is a collection of variable length sub-objects, as 
                  defined for ERO object; each sub-object has the following format:

                     Type:   the Type field specifies the type of the information 
                              included in the ôsub-object contentsö field; in fact it 
                              is necessary to distinguish not only between IP addresses 
                              and  Area_IDs,  but  also  among  different  kind  of  IP 
                              addresses and Area_IDs; the possible values are: 
                      
                              -IPv4 address (Type = 1) 
                   
                   
                              -IPv6 address (Type = 2) 
                              -Autonomous System ID (Type = 32) 
                              -OSPF Area_ID (Type = 33) 
                              -Optical island ID (Type = 34) 
                   
                              These last three ID are the so called ôArea.IDö. 
                               
                    Length:   the length field specifies the total length of the sub-
                              objects in bytes, including the Type and Length fields; 
                              it must be a multiple of 4 and its value must be at least 
                              4.

                              IPv6 address: an IPv6 address treated as a prefix, based 
                                            on the value of the field Addr.len. Bits 
                                            beyond this prefix should be ignored on 
                                            receipt. 
                   
                               
               4.3.2.3. Sub-object 3-4-5:  Area_ID 
                
                    These three sub-objects have the same format, but differ one from 
                  the other in, obviously, the Type field, and also by the structure of 
                  the identifiers whether they identify AS, OSPF areas, or optical 
                  islands; we decided to use the same format for these sub-objects 
                  because they are processed in the same manner. This format is shown 
                  in Fig. 7c

               4.3.3. Processing of the ARO 
                
                    In this section we explain how ARO object is processed. 
                    Since the purpose of the ARO is to keep track of the nodes along 
                  the second path, only reading or adding sub-objects operations will 
                  be performed on it. 
                    When a PATH message arrives at a node, the node first checks 
                  whether the received PATH message contains an ARO; if no ARO is 
                  present,  the  requested  path  is  unprotected,  and  the  procedure                                                     
                  explained in [EXCLUDE-ROUTE] can be followed, see Section 4.2; on

               draft-dachille-inter-area-path-protection-00.txt          January 2004
                                                   
                  the other hand, if the requested path is protected, the ARO is 
                  included in the PATH message sent along the first LSP and processed 
                  as follows. 
                   
                    A border node receiving a PATH message relative to the first LSP 
                  MUST check if Area.ID of the next area towards the tail-end node, say 
                  area X, is included in one of the ARO sub-objects (e.g. in the 
                  example of Section 4.2, node B3 checks if Area_ID A4 is included in 
                  the ARO). 
                   
                  - If area X ID is included, working and backup LSPs will share the 
                    area X and the border node MUST perform disjoint route selection 
                    algorithm on the virtual topology obtained pruning the following 
                    nodes, depending on the ARO content: 
                     
                      - If the previous sub-object in the ARO is an Area_ID sub-object,  
                        first and second LSPs do not share the previous area as a 
                        common one; all border nodes connecting to areas either not 
                        included in the ARO, or included in the ERO, MUST be pruned. 
                        This operation guarantees edge continuity and disjointedness of 
                        the two LSPs within the area X. 
                       
                      - Otherwise the ARO includes the IPv4/IPv6 sub-object relative to 
                        last computed border node along the second route; this means 
                        that first and second LSPs share the previous area. All border 
                        nodes, except the above referred one, connecting to areas 
                        either not included in the ARO, or not included in the ERO, 
                        MUST be pruned. As example, focus on Fig. 5 and Fig. 5c and 
                        assume that the two LSPs share area 4 and area 5 (area X = area 
                        5), so that nodes B6 and B5 are the last nodes along the two 
                        LSP in area 4; when node B6 performs disjoint route selection 
                        algorithm, only nodes B6, B5, B9, B10, MUST NOT be pruned in 
                        order to guarantee the right selection of the two routes. 
                       
                      - In both the previous cases, border nodes connecting to next 
                        areas included in the ERO and in the ARO MUST also be pruned, 
                        except one border node per area, so that the two LSPs will 
                        follow the computed paths. As example, in Section 4, B2 and B4 
                        have been pruned, so the two LSPs will follow the computed 
                        inter-area paths. If the two LSPs will share the next areas, 
                        this step MUST not be performed. 
                   
                  - If area X ID is not included in the ARO, only the first LSP will 
                    cross area X; since the second LSP does not share area X with the 
                    first LSP, the border node, MUST only perform an ERO expansion as 
                    described in [EXCLUDE-ROUTE] and no ARO processing is required. 
                   
                    When a PATH message containing ERO and ARO objects arrives at the 
                  tail-end node, the ARO object is copied into the RESV message that 
                  the tail-end sends back to the head-end node. Likewise, the ARO will 
                  not be processed by intermediate nodes, but only by the head-end 
                  node, since it provides the route of the second path. When such a 
                  RESV  message  arrives  at  the head-end node, the ARO must be used

               draft-dachille-inter-area-path-protection-00.txt          January 2004
                                                   
                  to create the ERO object included in the PATH message sent along the 
                  second LSP, with these constraints: 
                   
                    - Every node included in the ARO is copied into ERO and marked as 
                       Strict; in the example of section 4.1, the ERO created by node A 
                       and included in the PATH message is: B(Strict)-D(Strict)-
                       F(Strict)-H(Strict). 
                    - If ARO contains Area.IDs (note that this can only occur in the 
                       General Mesh Topology case, since it foresees the partial ARO 
                       expansion), a proper Type-32 ERO subobject is added to ERO; in 
                       the example of section 4.2, the ERO created by node A and 
                       included  in  the  PATH  message  is:  B1(Strict)-A2(Loose)-
                       B7(Strict)-B9(Strict)-B(Strict). 
                   
                    When the head-end node sends a PATH including such an ERO (and no 
                  ARO), it is processed as in [EXCLUDE-ROUTE] or in [VASSEUR], with ERO 
                  expansion when the next hop is marked as Loose. If this step is 
                  successful, the tail-end will send back a RESV, which will allocate 
                  resources for the backup path, but if there is a problem and the 
                  backup one canÆt be allocated, then the working path previously 
                  installed must be pulled down. 
                
                  
                      
               5. Possible Refinements 
                
                    There are some issues not contemplated in this document which have 
                  been left to future developments:                    
                    - Assign costs to virtual links to push toward area-disjoint path 
                       selection to possible extent. For example, a possibility would 
                       be to set the cost of a virtual link from border node A to 
                       destination D to W=H*K, where H is the maximum intra-area 
                       diameter throughout the whole network, and K is the number of 
                       areas between two areas in the shortest path between A and D; 
                    - When  the  head-end  node  creates  the  PATH  message,  it  may 
                       immediately select which path would be the working one and which 
                       the backup one, or it may await the two paths to be established 
                       before selecting the working one; only in the latter case it is 
                       possible to guarantee that the shortest path is selected as the 
                       working one. This point may require further analysis; 
                    - Possibility to implement bandwidth sharing exploiting the ARO 
                       object; 
                    - Extensions to SRLG- and link-disjoint paths; 
                    - Extensions to dual-fault protection. 
                   
                   
               6. Terminology 
                
                  SRLG:   A group of links that may be affected by the same fault; 
                  GLSP:   Generalized  LSP; more details can be found in [GMPLS];
