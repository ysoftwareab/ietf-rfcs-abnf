Abstract

   This document describes how an HTTP GET request to an HTTP-Enabled
   Location Delivery (HELD) resource is handled by the server
   responsible for that resource.  This ensures that requests generated

   by user agents that are unaware of the special status of a URI do not
   result in unhelpful responses and enables the use of HTTP GET for
   location configuration and dereference.

Internet-Draft                  HELD GET                   February 2009


1.  Introduction

   The HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) protocol
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery] prohibits the use of the
   HTTP GET method.  It does this because a HELD request is not always
   safe and idempotent [RFC2616], an attribute necessary for use of GET.

   The behaviour that is expected when a client makes an HTTP GET
   request to the a HELD URI is therefore undefined.  GET is the method
   assumed by generic user agents, therefore unless context identifies
   an "https:" URI as a HELD URI, such a user agent might simply send an
   HTTP GET.

   Rather than providing an HTTP 405 (Method Not Allowed) response
   indicating that POST is the only permitted method, this document
   specifies that a LIS provides a HELD location response if it receives
   an HTTP GET request.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  HTTP GET Behaviour

   A HELD URI is an "https:" or "http:" URI that is either the product
   of LIS discovery [I-D.ietf-geopriv-lis-discovery] or a location URI
   generated by a LIS.

   An HTTP GET request to a HELD URI produces a HELD response as if the
   following HELD request had been sent using HTTP POST:

     <locationRequest xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held">
       <locationType exact="false">
         geodetic civic
       </locationType>
     </locationRequest>

   If the URI is a location URI, the limited profile of HELD described
   in [I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-deref-protocol] is applied.  In
   particular, a location URI MUST NOT be provided in response to a
   location dereferencing request.

   HTTP GET requests must be safe and idempotent - that is, there are no
   side-effects of making the request and repeating the request does not
   change the result.  If the response provides a location object, this
   does not pose a problem.  Changes in the location information do not

   occur as a result of requests, they are a result of a change in the
   value of the resource (the resource being the location of the
   Target).

   To ensure that these requests are idempotent, a LIS MUST NOT generate
   a location URI as a result of serving this request.  However, if a
   location URI already exists, it can be provided.  To achieve this, a
   location URI might be pre-allocated based on Target identity.  This
   approach only works as long as the location URI operates on the
   "authorization by possession" authorization model
   ([I-D.ietf-geopriv-lbyr-requirements]).

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of HELD
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery] apply.  This document
   introduces no further security considerations.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
