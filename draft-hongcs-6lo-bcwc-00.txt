Emergency Communication for Low Energy Body-Centric Wearable Networks
                        draft-hongcs-6lo-bcwc-00

Abstract

Wearable devices are among the core technologies for Internet of Things
(IoT).  Recent advances in wireless communication devices have made it 
possible to create a wearable network in and around the human body. Such 
a network can be used for diverse applications such as monitoring human
body activities and personal entertainments. A typical wearable device 
runs on battery power, which is limited and often non-rechargeable. 
Therefore, a low energy operation environment is desirable. Emergency 
traffic management is an important aspect of such a network. This 
document describes how an out-of-bound external wake up based on 
on-demand mechanism can work to successfully transmit emergency traffic 
in a typical body-centric wearable network (BC-WN).

1.  Introduction

In recent times, the design and implementation of wearable systems 
are on the rise. They are being actively used in both medical and 
non-medical applications.

A network of such devices can be formed to monitor activities in and 
around the human body. However, the devices usually have limited 
processing, battery, and memory capacity. Energy efficiency and low 
delay are among the major design issues. To save energy, a device is 
put into sleep mode when not in use. This means the main radio is 
turned off. It is turned on when there is a need for communication. 
Managing this sleep and wake up mechanism is a delicate affair. It can 
be managed through scheduling. Periodic scheduling of sleep/wake up is 
easier to implement. 

Emergency communication is an important aspect of such a wearable 
network. If device wants to transmit emergency data to another device, 
which is turned off, an on-demand scheme can be used to successfully
transmit it in an unscheduled mode. Since in such a scenario, a 
device does not periodically wake up to check the medium for 
packets, a sender can use an external trigger mechanism to wake up 
a sleeping device to communicate. 

RFC4944 [RFC4944] specifies the transmission of IPv6 over 
IEEE802.15.4. The BC-WN in many respects has similar 
characteristics to that of IEEE802.15.4. This document specifies 
the details of a system to manage an emergency event in wearable 
device communication in an efficient manner.


1.1.  Terminology and Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

This document is in part inspired by [IEEE802-2011].  

2.  Emergency Communication

Emergency events can occur due to several reasons. It may happen in 
any of the devices including the network controller. For example, 
a device can sense abnormality in the sensing data. It can also sense 
that the battery is dying. The Controller may face critical problems 
during its operation. It may also require sudden data from a device,
which is currently in the sleep state. All of these can be classified 
as an emergency or urgent task. The tasks can be medical health 
related or non-medical in nature. The handling of the emergency event 
is a very sensitive issue in a BAN. The delay must be as low as 
possible to handle such situations.

2.1.  Communication Process

A wake up process is handled using the wake up radio. A two-stage 
communication process is used as shown in Figure 1. In stage-1, 
the wake up radio is switched on. Once the receiver node verifies 
itself as the intended receiver, it transmits back an acknowledgment 
to the sender using the same channel. In stage-2, the main radio 
transceivers are triggered on for data communication.

2.2.  Data communication

An example of the emergency communication process is shown in 
Figure 2. In the first case, the case of an emergency wake up 
command (emergency alarm) packet is depicted. This process is 
completed in stage-1 itself. It can be used to notify about 
emergency types, which the receiver (controller) can know by looking 
into predefined information in the wake up packet.

The emergency command is a short wake up frame (SWUF). The sender then
waits for the wake up acknowledgment (WACK) timeout period. It 
retransmits the command if no WACK is received. The process continues 
until successful. The second case depicts an on-demand data 
communication process. In this case, the wake up process is followed 
by the data communication process and ends with an acknowledgment(ACK).

2.3 Network setup

A star topology is used as shown in Figure 3.

                Figure 3: BC-WN Star topology

All the devices in the network MUST be equipped with antennae for the 
wake up radio and data communication. A device is capable of both 
receiving and sending the wake up radio signal. It remains in the 
sleep state until either an event triggers it on or it is woken up 
by external radio signal.

2.4.  Packets

A typical wake up packet uses the address of a node as shown in 
Figure 4. The fields in the wake up packets are - frame header, 
address, payload and frame check sequence (FCS) using the cyclic 
redundancy code (CRC) algorithm. The frame header contains a preamble
and start frame delimiter (SFD). They help against miss and false 
detection and provide synchronization. Node address or ID is used to 
identify the intended receiver. The payload contains information 
about the events. 


   +---------+---------+-----------+-------+
   | Frame   |Address  | Payload   |  CRC  |
   | Header  |         |           |       |
   +---------+---------+-----------+-------+
       Figure 4: Wake up packet

Other MAC frames used are shown in Figure 5. A 'More Data' field 
is used for multiple packets transmission. One bit is used 
to depict simple yes/no for more data packets. The final packet size 
depends on the payload field. The physical (PHY) layer packet 
properties are similar to the IEEE802.15.4 channel model.

3.  Low Energy Operation

A BC-WN uses a low power wake up radio for prompt communication. There 
is a lack of a satisfactory means to communicate immediately in 
current protocols and delay is a major issue. This is also true in 
the case of the IEEE15.4x standard protocols.

A wake up radio based system through the on-demand request can 
significantly reduce the idle state energy consumption. A typical 
wearable network has 1 to 10m coverage area. In addition, there is 
only a very limited impact on latency because the corresponding device 
wakes up immediately. Wake up radios operate at very low power mode.

The wake up radio based MAC takes advantage of a typical BC-WN 
as follows:
- smaller network size in terms of devices compared to typical 
sensor networks;
- limited communication range;
- a device can be easily triggered on by external wake up radio signal;
- wake up radio puts little extra cost in terms of power consumption.


3.1 On-demand communication with addressing

Addressing is an important factor in the wake up radio. It is used for 
selective communication. A flow chart of a typical wake up radio based 
system using addressing is shown in Figure 6. It is to be noted that 
energy is consumed to decode a wake up packet to determine the 
recipient. Addressing can reduce the waking up of all the nodes in the 
neighborhood with a slight increase in the complexity.

3.2.  MAC Operation and back-off

A slotted contention based mechanism is used for communication. An 
example MAC operation is shown in Figure 7. A device with an emergency 
event uses channel sensing to check the channel for activity. It also 
uses the back-off mechanism to avoid the collision. It uses single 
clear channel assessment (CCA) unlike the IEEE802.15.4.

                 Figure 7: MAC operation and back-off

				 

Before attempting to transmit, a device utilizes the back-off 
mechanism. It chooses the value from the range (0, B), where 
the back-off window size (B) can be fixed or adapted as per the 
application requirements. The value it chooses is called the back-off 
counter. It is expressed in terms of slots. The counter value is 
decremented one slot at a time. For example, if it chooses a back-off 
value of 3, it waits for 3 slots before reattempting to transmit the 
packet. Once the counter expires, it senses the channel. If the 
channel is idle, it transmits the wake up radio packet. If it senses 
the channel busy, it chooses a new value for the Counter and the 
process is repeated.
