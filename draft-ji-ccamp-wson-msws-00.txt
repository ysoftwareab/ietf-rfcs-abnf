Internet-Draft          MSWS Method for WSON                 July 2008 
    

Abstract 

   This document proposes a method called Most Sharable Wavelength per 
   Segment (MSWS) to support shared-mesh restoration for wavelength 
   switched optical networks (WSON). The proposed method can perform 
   efficient wavelength sharing in a distributed fashion. It uses the 
   signaling extensions for WSON which is previously proposed in the 
   document "Signaling Extensions for Wavelength Switched Optical 
   Networks" (draft-bernstein-ccamp-wson-signaling-01) and no other 
   protocol extensions of Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching 
   (GMPLS) routing and signaling are needed.

1. Introduction 

   GMPLS extends MPLS to support Time-Division Multiplex Capable (TDM), 
   Lambda Switch Capable (LSC) and Fiber-Switch Capable (FSC) interfaces 
   and switching. However optical switching technologies are 
   significantly different from other circuit switch technologies such 
   as TDM. [WSON-frame] provided a framework for applying GMPLS and Path 
   Computation Element (PCE) architecture to the control of WSON. In 
   [WSON-Info], an informational model and efficient encodings of 
   information needed by routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) in WSON 
   are provided. [WSON-Signaling] provides extensions to GMPLS signaling

   for control of WSON. [WSON-PCEP] provides requirements and protocol 
   enhancements for the Path Computation Element communication Protocol 
   (PCEP) for the support of WSON.  

   Through an automated common control plane, GMPLS can provide various 
   and flexible recovery mechanisms. Functional description, protocol 
   extensions, terminology and analysis of GMPLS-based recovery 
   mechanisms are given in [RFC4426], [RFC4427], [RFC4428], [RFC4872] 
   and [RFC4873]. Shared-mesh restoration defined in [RFC4427], is an 
   efficient approach to reduce the restoration resource requirements by 
   allowing multiple restoration (Label Switched Paths) LSPs to share 
   common resources. Until now, requirements and extensions of GMPLS to 
   support shared-mesh restoration for WSON are not specified. 

   This memo proposes MSWS method to support shared mesh restoration for 
   WSON. The proposed method can perform efficient wavelength sharing in 
   a distributed fashion. It uses the signaling extensions for WSON 
   which is proposed by [WSON-Signaling] and no other protocol 
   extensions of GMPLS routing and signaling is needed.

3. Problem Statement and Analysis 

3.1. Current GMPLS-based Shared-Mesh Restoration 

   According to current GMPLS-based shared-mesh restoration mechanism, 
   the routing approach does not require the flooding of any per LSP 
   information or any detailed distribution of the bandwidth allocation 
   per component link or individual ports. This routing approach is 
   referred to as a Partial (or Aggregated) Information Routing 
   [RFC4428]. To be specific, the Maximum Reservable Bandwidth, the 
   Unreserved Bandwidth, and the Maximum LSP Bandwidth (see [RFC4202]) 
   are the useful information during protecting path computation in 
   shared-mesh restoration. By using the aggregated information, source 
   node can perform path computation for the protecting path considering 
   resource sharing. Then signaling process is generated. First, the 
   recovery resources for the protecting LSPs are pre-reserved during 
   the provisioning phase. Then when a failure on the working LSP occurs, 
   an explicit signaling action is required to activate the protecting 
   LSPs[RFC 4872]. An ASSOCIATION object is defined to associate working 
   LSPs with their corresponding protecting LSPs. A PRIMARY_PATH_ROUTE 
   object is defined to inform nodes along the path of the protecting

   LSP about which resources are being used by the associated working 
   LSP. 

3.2. Wavelength Resource Sharing in WSON 

   In a WSON with no wavelength converters, it is normally required that 
   the same wavelength be allocated on all the links along the path. 
   This limitation is known as the "wavelength continuity constraint", 
   which makes the path selection of WSON different from that of other 
   circuit switched networks (such as TDM). With wavelength converters, 
   a lightpath does not have to be on the same wavelength and can 
   consist of several consecutive wavelength continuous segments, with 
   wavelength conversion carried out at the junction nodes. Network 
   performance can be greatly improved by adding wavelength conversion 
   ability. However, since wavelength converters are still expensive, 
   only some of the network nodes will have capability of wavelength 
   conversion. In the case of limited or no wavelength converters are 
   implemented, route computation is known as Routing and Wavelength 
   Assignment (RWA) problem. Three possible RWA computation 
   architectures are discussed in [WSON-Frame]. They are combined RWA, 
   separate routing and WA and routing with distributed WA. In the first 
   two methods, exact network link wavelength information is required at 
   any entity that responsible for RWA or WA. In the third method, 
   routing is performed at a computational entity (PCE or NE), while 
   wavelength assignment is performed in a distributed fashion across 
   nodes along the path. In this memo, we focus on shared-mesh 
   restoration under routing with distributed WA architecture.  

   Here we discuss the shortcomings of existing GMPLS protocols in 
   supporting shared-mesh restoration for WSON. The current link 
   resource measures in GMPLS do not provide enough information needed 
   for RWA [WSON-frame]. If current routing methods for shared-mesh 
   restoration are used, the pre-reserved wavelength resource for a 
   protecting path may not satisfy the "Wavelength Continuity 
   Constraints". [WSON-Signaling] proposed a more compact Wavelength 
   Sets object instead of the LABEL_SET object (see [RFC3471] and 
   [RFC3473]) to describe the current set of available wavelengths 
   during the distributed WA process. On reception of Path message, 
   destination node gets the available wavelengths along the path, thus 
   it can perform certain wavelength selection algorithm such as First-
   Fit, Random, Least-Loaded. (Notice that Least-Loaded algorithm needs 
   some supplemental information.) This method works well for the 
   distributed WA of working path, but not for the protecting path. Even 
   if Wavelength Set object is used to collect the wavelength 
   availability information along the protecting path, it is still hard 
   to perform efficient distributed WA at the destination node. An 
   example is given as follows.

           Figure 1 Example network topology 

   Example: 

   Figure 1 depicts part of a mesh topology WSON network which consists 
   of Wavelength Cross-Connects (WXCs) and (Dense WDM) DWDM links. A 
   lightpath (wavelength-based LSP) from node A to node G is to be setup. 
   Routing with distributed WA is used and routing for working path and 
   protecting path is performed at a computational entity PCE1 [WSON-
   PCEP]. Node A generates Path message and starts the distributed WA 
   process. 

   Here, we use the network link configuration given in [WSON-Signaling]. 
   A 40 channel C-Band DWDM system with 100GHz spacing with lowest 
   frequency 192.0THz (1561.4nm) and highest frequency 195.9THz 
   (1530.3nm) is used in the example network. These frequencies 
   correspond to n = -11, and n = 28 respectively. Now suppose the 
   following channels are available and five wavelengths (1, 2, 3, 4, 
    6) are sharable on some link. n value and bit map position are 
   defined for Wavelength Set object [WSON-Signaling]. The wavelength 
   available and sharable information is showed as follows:

   By checking the information in PRIMARY_PATH_ROUTE object, each node 
   along the protecting path can decide which wavelength on the local 
   links can be shared with the current protecting path. On reception of 
   a Path message with the available wavelengths in Wavelength Set 
   object, the destination selects a wavelength for the lightpath. Since 
   no per wavelength information on each link is known to node G. It 
   will be confused to choose a wavelength according to the wavelength 
   available information in Wavelength Set object and can not realize 
   efficient resource sharing. According to local information at G, the 
   wavelength sharing can be only performed at last hop (link F-G) by 
   selecting 2 (2 is the only wavelength G knows for sure that can be 
   shared). In fact, wavelength sharing can be performed at link (B-C), 
   (C-D) and (E-F) if 6 is selected. 

4. MSWS Method 

   This section presents our MSWS method to support shared-mesh 
   restoration under routing with distributed WA architecture in WSON. 

   A lightpath can have one or more consecutive wavelength continuous 
   segments, with wavelength conversion carried out at the junction 
   nodes. In a segment, the first node (at upstream) is its head-end 
   node and the last node (at downstream) is its tail-end node. The 
   basic idea of MSWS method is to collect the wavelength sharable 
   information in Path message along the protecting path. And on 
   reception of the Resv message, the tail-end node of each segment 
   selects the most sharable wavelength of this segment based on the 
   collected information. 

4.1. Conveying Wavelength Sharable information 

   Wavelength Set Metric TLV is defined in [WSON-Signaling] to provide 
   supplemental information for distributed wavelength assignment. Here 
   we inherit that TLV to convey information about sharable capability 
   of each wavelength. Info Type is set to 1 (means list). There is a 
   one-to-one correspondence between the value in the list of Wavelength 
   Set Metric and the available wavelength in Wavelength Set. Along the

Internet-Draft          MSWS Method for WSON                 July 2008 
    

   protecting path, RSVP-TE Path message will collect the wavelength 
   sharable information and modify Wavelength Set Metric TLV. This 
   process will be explained in the following sections. 

4.2. Procedures 

4.2.1. With No Wavelength Converters 

   First, a simple scenario where no wavelength converters are 
   implemented to the network (or no wavelength converters will be used 
   along the protecting path) is considered. In this case, the whole 
   path is a single wavelength continuous segment. As RSVP-TE Path 
   message travels along the path, following operations should be 
   performed: 

   1. A Wavelength Set object is used to indicate the wavelength 
      availability along the path. The operation for processing this 
      object is the same to that is described in [RFC3473] and [WSON-
      signaling]. 

   2. At the beginning, the value corresponding to each wavelength in 
      Wavelength Set Metric is set to 0. Source node generates Path 
      message with Wavelength Set object and Wavelength Set Metric. On 
      reception of the Path message, each node is responsible to decide 
      the sharable wavelengths for this hop (from itself to its 
      downstream node). If certain wavelength is sharable, its 
      corresponding value in Wavelength Set Metric is increased by 1.  

   3. Wavelength Set Metric is modified and passed along the protecting 
      path in Path message until it gets to the destination node. The 
      destination node is responsible to perform wavelength selection 
      according to Wavelength Set object and Wavelength Set Metric. The 
      wavelength with largest value (the most sharable wavelength) in 
      the list of Wavelength Set Metric value is selected. 

   Example: In Figure 1, the Wavelength Set object and Wavelength Set 
   Metric TLV received at destination node G is showed as follows: 

   Wavelength Set object:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
    

   Since the value corresponding to 6 is 3, 6 will be selected by 
   destination node G and wavelength sharing will be performed on three 
   links on the protecting path. 

4.2.2. With Limited Wavelength Converters 

   In case Wavelength Converters are used each lightpath may include 
   several consecutive wavelength continuous segments. On reception of 
   the Path message, intermediate node with wavelength conversion 
   ability can decide whether wavelength conversion is required by 
   checking whether the egress available wavelengths for the available 
   wavelengths in Wavelength Set object is null or deemed too small.

   1. Source node generates Path message with Wavelength Set object and 
      Wavelength Set Metric. The operations to process Wavelength Set 
      object and Wavelength Set Metric inside a wavelength continuous 
      segment are similar to that in section 4.2.1. On reception of the 
      Path message, the tail-end node of a segment stores the Wavelength 
      Set and Wavelength Set Metric of this segment. And it generates a 
      new Wavelength Set Metric according to the Wavelength Set and 
      resets the value in the list in Wavelength Set Metric TLV to 0. If 
      this tail-end node is not the destination, it must be the head-end 
      of the next wavelength continuous segment. It will decide the 
      sharable wavelength of the next hop and starts a new round of 
      collecting Wavelength Set Metric operation. 

   2. The destination node is always the tail-end of the last wavelength 
      continuous segment and it is responsible to perform wavelength 
      selection for the last segment according to the Wavelength Set and 
      Wavelength Set Metric of its segment. On reception of the Resv 
      message, the tail-end of each segment is responsible to perform 
      wavelength selection for its own segment. 

5. Discussion 

   Wavelength converter sharing is allowed but not deliberately 
   considered in our proposed method. The tail-end of a wavelength 
   continuous segment can optionally carry out wavelength converter 
   sharing during the Resv process if it is possible.  

   A probable way to explore wavelength converter sharing ability is to 
   enlarge the wavelength set at every node where wavelength sharing is 
   possible. However, this will potentially lead to break wavelength 
   continuity even though it is not necessary. Maybe the "Reserve field" 
   in Wavelength Set object can be used to provide more precisely 
   control to deal with this contradiction.
