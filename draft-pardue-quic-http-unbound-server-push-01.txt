                Unbound Server Push (USP) for HTTP/QUIC
             draft-pardue-quic-http-unbound-server-push-01

Abstract

   This document defines an HTTP semantic extension, Unbound Server Push
   (USP), which allows HTTP resources to be pushed without the need for
   a prior HTTP request.  HTTP/QUIC clients opt in to this feature via
   an HTTP/QUIC setting.

1.  Introduction

   HTTP server push is a feature of HTTP/2 [RFC7540] and HTTP/QUIC
   [QUIC-HTTP] that allows a server to pre-emptively send HTTP resources
   to a client in association with a previous client-initiated request.
   This binding to a request object aligns with paradigms familiar to
   client and server implementations.  Unbound server push, in contrast,
   may provide benefits for use cases where holding a request object
   open for long periods (long polling) is undesirable, or where a
   request object does not exist (unidirectional flows).  (The
   introduction of unidirectional streams in the QUIC transport
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT] provides a direct expression of this message
   exchange pattern.)

   This document defines an HTTP/QUIC protocol extension that allows a
   server to send one or more HTTP/QUIC "PUSH_PROMISE" frame on a new
   server-initiated unidirectional stream type: the unbound promise
   stream Section 2.  Endpoints opt in to the unbound server push
   feature using a "SETTINGS" parameter (Section 3) in accordance with
   Section 5.5 of [RFC7540].  This is the only behavioural change to
   server push as described in [QUIC-HTTP].  Unbound server push
   operates in addition to bound server push for any HTTP/QUIC
   connection.

   Unbound server push should be used with care.  It may introduce
   complexities for implementations, particularly intermediaries, and it
   can pose challenges for presentation to the application above HTTP.

   In deployments where multiple client connections are trunked by a
   reverse proxy onto a single upstream connection, unbound server push

   is effectively a mechanism for achieving application-level multicast
   to all downstream clients that have enabled this feature.

      *Authors' Note:* Unbound server push is proposed as an extension
      to HTTP/QUIC in order to start a discussion on whether this
      feature should be incorporated into the core HTTP/QUIC
      specification document.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  The Unbound Promise Stream Type

   An unbound promise stream is indicated by a stream type of "0xTBD".
   Data on this stream consists of one or more "PUSH_PROMISE" frames,
   sent in accordance with [QUIC-HTTP].  Only servers can promise; if a
   server receives a client-initiated unbound promise stream, this MUST
   be treated as a stream error of type HTTP_WRONG_DIRECTION.

3.  The SETTINGS_ENABLE_UNBOUND_PUSH Parameter

   This document adds a new HTTP/QUIC "SETTINGS" Parameter to those
   defined by Section 7.3 of [QUIC-HTTP].

   The new parameter is "SETTINGS_ENABLE_UNBOUND_PUSH" (type = 0xTBD).
   This setting can be used to enable unbound server push.  The value of
   the parameter is an integer that MUST be 0 or 1.  Any value other
   than 0 or 1 MUST be treated as a connection error of type
   "PROTOCOL_ERROR".

   The initial value is 0, which indicates that unbound server push is
   disabled by default.

4.  Usage of Unbound Server Push

   Unbound server push changes only one aspect of HTTP/QUIC server push:
   the stream type on which an HTTP/QUIC "PUSH_PROMISE" frame can be
   sent.  It does not prevent the conventional use of bound server push;
   both types MAY be used concurrently.  The Push ID number space is
   shared across both types.  Unbound server push is subject to the
   limits imposed by the HTTP/QUIC "MAX_PUSH_ID" frame.

   An endpoint that receives the "SETTINGS_ENABLE_UNBOUND_PUSH"
   parameter set to a value of 0 MUST only send an HTTP/QUIC
   "PUSH_PROMISE" frame on an appropriate client-initiated bidirectional
   request stream.  An endpoint that has set this parameter to 0 and had
   it acknowledged MUST treat the reception of an HTTP/QUIC
   "PUSH_PROMISE" frame on any other stream type as a connection error
   of type "PROTOCOL_ERROR".

   A server that receives the "SETTINGS_ENABLE_UNBOUND_PUSH" parameter
   set to a value of 1 MAY send an HTTP/QUIC "PUSH_PROMISE" frame on an
   unbound promise stream.

   A client that has sent the "SETTINGS_ENABLE_UNBOUND_PUSH" parameter
   set to 1, and received this parameter set to a value of 1, SHOULD be
   ready for a server to send an HTTP/QUIC "PUSH_PROMISE" frame on
   unbound push streams at any time.

5.  0-RTT Considerations

   Client 0-RTT is not affected by server push configuration.  There are
   no additional consideration to be made beyond those defined in
   [QUIC-HTTP].

6.  Handling Multiple Clients

   Unbound server push was discussed during the development of HTTP/2
   [RFC7540].  The assessment was that servers that handle multiple
   clients within the same stack or context (such as an HTTP
   intermediary) may have a difficult time routing promises to the
   correct client.  The applicability of unbound server push should be
   assessed and enabled where the risk of misdirected promises is
   determined to be acceptable.

7.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional consideration beyond those presented in
   [QUIC-HTTP].

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  Registration of Unbound Promise Stream Type

   This document establishes an entry for the HTTP/QUIC Stream Type
   registry that is established by [QUIC-HTTP].

   Stream Type:  Unbound Promise Stream

   Code:  0xTBD
