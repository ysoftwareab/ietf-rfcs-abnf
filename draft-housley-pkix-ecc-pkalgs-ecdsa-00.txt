Abstract

   Dan Brown from Certicom has submitted a specification for Additional
   Algorithms and Identifiers for use of Elliptic Curve Cryptography
   with PKIX.  This document proposes a different approach for
   identifying the one-way hash function used with the ECDSA signature
   algorithm.

1. Introduction

   RFC 3279 [N1] specifies the conventions for using many algorithms
   with certificates and CRLs.  When ECDSA is used with SHA-1, RFC 3279
   says that the following object identifier ought to be employed:

      ecdsa-with-SHA1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ecSigType 1 }

   Dan Brown from Certicom has submitted a specification for Additional
   Algorithms and Identifiers for use of Elliptic Curve Cryptography
   with PKIX [I1].  In his document, Dan proposes a different approach
   for identifying the one-way hash function used with the ECDSA
   signature algorithm.

   The following new object identifier identifies the one-way hash
   function is the one recommended for the public key size:

      ecdsa-with-Recommended OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ecSigType recommended(2) }

   In this case, the recommended one-way hash functions are given in the
   draft revision of X9.62 [I2].  The appropriate one-way has function
   is selected from SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512.  The
   recommended one has the largest bit size that does not require bit
   truncation during the signing process.  Bit truncation occurs when
   the one-way hash function output bit length is greater than the bit
   length of n, the order of the base point G.

   This approach leads to potential ambiguity in the future.  The
   concern is that additional one-way hash functions will be added to
   the "approved" set.

   The alternative is to explicitly identify the one-way hash function
   that is employed with ECDSA.

1.1. Conventions Used In This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [N2].

1.2. Abstract Syntax Notation

   All X.509 certificate [N3] extensions are defined using ASN.1
   [N4][7].

2. ECDSA with Explicit Identification of the One-Way Hash Function

   To avoid potential ambiguity, this specification provides algorithm
   identifiers for ECDSA with the following one-way hash functions:
   SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512.  Note that the algorithm
   identifier for ECDSA with SHA-1 is already provided in RFC 3279 [N1].

   These algorithm identifiers have already been assigned by ANSI X9F1.
   They are:

      ansi-X9-62 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) 10045 }

      id-ecSigType OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { ansi-X9-62 signatures(4) }

      id-ecdsa-with-SHA2 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-ecSigType 3}

      ecdsa-with-SHA224 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-ecdsa-with-SHA2 1}
      ecdsa-with-SHA256 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-ecdsa-with-SHA2 2}
      ecdsa-with-SHA384 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-ecdsa-with-SHA2 3}
      ecdsa-with-SHA512 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-ecdsa-with-SHA2 4}

3. Security Considerations

   This specification does not constrain the size of public keys or
   their parameters for use in the Internet PKI.  However, the key size
   selected impacts the strength achieved when implementing
   cryptographic services.  Selection of appropriate key sizes is
   critical to implementing appropriate security.

   This specification does not identify particular elliptic curves for
   use in the Internet PKI.  However, the particular curve selected
   impact the strength of the digital signatures.  Some curves are
   cryptographically stronger than others!

   In general, use of "well-known" curves, such as the "named curves"
   from ANSI X9.62 [I2], is a sound strategy.  For additional
   information, refer to X9.62 Appendix H.1.3, "Key Length
   Considerations" and Appendix A.1, "Avoiding Cryptographically Weak
   Keys".

4. IANA Considerations

   Certificate extensions and extended key usage values are identified
   by object identifiers (OIDs).  The OIDs used in this document are
   copied from the draft revision to X9.62 [I2].  These OIDs were
   assigned by ANSI X9F1.  No further action by the IANA is necessary
   for this document or any anticipated updates.
