1.  Introduction

   The Internet Key Exchange protocol [RFC7296] can use arbitrary
   signature algorithms as described in [RFC7427].  The latter RFC
   defines the SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS notification where each side of
   the IKE negotiation lists its supported hash algorithms.  This
   assumes that all signature schemes involve a hashing phase before a
   signature phase, which makes sense because most signature algorithms
   either cannot sign messages bigger than their key or truncate
   messages bigger than their key.

   [I.D-eddsa] defines signature algorithms that do not require pre-
   hashing of the message.  Unlike other methods, these signature
   algorithms accept arbitrary-sized messages, so no pre-hashing is
   required.  These methods are called Ed25519 and Ed448, which
   respectively use the Edwards 25519 and the Edwards 448 ("Goldilocks")
   curves.  Although that document also defines pre-hashed versions of
   these algorithm, those versions are not recommended for protocols
   where the entire to-be-signed message is available at once.

   [I.D-eddsa] defines the binary format of the signatures that should
   be used in the "Signature Value" field of the Authentication Data
   Format in section 3.  [I.D-pkix-newcurves] defined the OIDs for these
   two signature methods.  To signal within IKE that no hashing needs to
   be done.  A new value has to be signalled in the
   SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS notification, one that indicates that no
   hashing is performed.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  The "Identity" Hash Identifier

   This document defines a new value called "Identity" (value TBA by
   IANA) in the hash algorithm registry for use in the
   SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS notification.  Inserting this value into
   the notification indicates that the receiver supports at least one
   signature algorithm that accepts arbitrary-sized messages such as
   Ed25519 and Ed448.

   Ed25519 and Ed448 are only defined with the Identity hash, and MUST
   NOT be sent to a receiver that has not indicated support for the
   "Identity" hash.

   The pre-hashed versions of Ed25519 and Ed448 (Ed25519ph and Ed448ph
   respectively) SHOULD NOT be used in IKE.

3.  Security Considerations

   The new "Identity" value is needed only for signature algorithms that
   accept an arbitrary-sized input.  It MUST NOT be used if none of the
   supported algorithms has this property.  OTOH there is no good reason
   to hash where the signature algorithm does not require it (or does it
   internally), so the "Identity" value SHOULD be the only one used if
   all of the supported signature algorithms have this property.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a new value from the "IKEv2 Hash
   Algorithms" registry with name "Identity" and this document as
   reference.
