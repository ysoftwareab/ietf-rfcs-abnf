Internet-Draft                Roles in XCON                 October 2005


1.  Introduction

   This document defines the set of possible conferencing roles that are
   used to represent participants withing a Conference Object (as
   defined in the XCON Conference Framework [1]).  The document also
   provides a set of semantics associated with each role.  Additional
   roles may be defined in the future, as necessary, with their
   corresponding schema extensions, as appropriate.

   A Conference Media template [6] specifies which roles are available
   in a Conference Object, including the maximum number of occurrence
   permitted for each role.  A media template also defines properties
   such as default values for each role, the conference controls
   available to each role and how they may be manipulated, and which
   media streams (with associated properties) are associated with each
   role.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [2].


3.  Overview of Roles

   This document defines five logical roles that a Conference System
   should assume are available in a Conference Object.  In hierarchical
   order they are: "administrator", "creator", "moderator",
   "participant", and "observer".  These five roles are sufficient to
   delineate the various privileges that conference attendees need in a
   variety of conference scenarios [3].  The specific media capabilities
   of each role are defined in the conference template [6].  It should
   be noted that all five roles need not be specified or present in the
   conference template but SHOULD be supported by the Conference System.
   A Conference System MAY choose not to support a particular role if it
   can unequivocally decide that the role will not be required in any of
   the templates supported.

   These five roles have an intrinsic hierarchical order within a
   specific conference.  By hierarchical order, it is implied that the
   "administrator" by default should have higher privileges than a
   "creator", which by default should have higher privileges than a
   "moderator" and so on.  For example, the "administrator" should have
   the ability to make changes to all conference variables during
   instantiation and full lifecycle of the Conference Object.  The
   "creator" is the 'owner' of the conference and has various privileges



Morgan & Novo            Expires April 20, 2006                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                Roles in XCON                 October 2005


   which should allow them to modify the conference variables up to the
   time the conference is instantiated.  The "moderator" is a logical
   entity that will manage the conference.  The "participant" is a
   logical entity with generic privileges that will be attending a
   conference.  The "observer" is a logical entity which can only
   receive media streams from the conference.  All conference templates
   must have a role defined as "participant".

   Each user participating in a conference instace is an entity that can
   assume one or more roles.  Any entity can be allocated to an
   appropiated logical role.  A role can also be assumed in conjunction
   with the users identity within the Conference System as a result of
   an identity assertion transaction on the Conference System.  If no
   roles are defined for an entity, they should by default be a
   "participant" but local policy may define an alternative.

3.1.  Roles in the Conference Template

   When the <role> element is defined in the "Media Policy Template for
   XCON" [6], it will have a set of child elements that will specify the
   media capabilities available to a logical entity in that role.  These
   capabilities are collectively referred to as "privileges" and consist
   of a number of controls and parameters.  For example, the conference
   "moderator" may have privileges that allow them to either mute or
   remove a "participant".

   The <role> element MUST have an attribute called 'name'.  The 'name'
   MUST be one of the conference roles defined in this specification or
   an appropriate extension, specifically it has to be of type
   "administrator", "creator", "moderator", "participant", or
   "observer".

   The <role> element MAY have <parameter>, <control> and <stream> child
   elements (among others) specified in the conference template [6].
   The <stream> element defines the media streams available in that
   role.  The <role> can have one or more media streams available.  Each
   <stream> element MAY contain a child element called the <floor> that
   specifies a conference floor which can be controlled by a floor chair
   in the conference [7].  The role can have one or more active floors.
   Typically the "moderator" role contains a definition of the active
   floors.

3.2.  Roles in the Common Conference Data Model

   The <roles> element in the "Common Conference Information Data Model
   for Centralized Conferencing" [8] is a child element of the <user>
   element.  It specifies the roles of a user and it MAY contain a child
   element called the <description> that is a set of human readable

   strings that describes that role in the conference.  For example, it
   may contain information regarding the conference administrator and
   the best way to communicate with them or it may contain instructions
   such as conference recording (the addition of an observer) can only
   be enabled by contacting the administrator and requesting that a
   service-uri be added to the conference.


4.  Role Definitions

   This section defines the different types of roles in a conference
   system.

4.1.  Administrator

   The administrator role is typically the system administrator of the
   Conference System.  By default, someone in this role SHOULD have the
   ability to read or modify all conference elements.  All conferences
   SHOULD specify an "administrator".

4.2.  Creator

   The role of "creator" is used to identify the logical entity that
   created the conference.  The conference creator is the 'owner' of the
   conference and has various privileges which SHOULD allow them to
   modify the conference variables up to the time the conference is
   instantiated.

   In the case of an ad-hoc conference, also known as a reservationless
   or on-demand conference, there may be no conference creator, or the
   conference creator may be specified as the conference focus.

   The conference creator does not necessarily have to attend the
   meeting.  They could be a secretary that sets up the meeting.

   When the conference creator attends the meeting, the hierarchical
   nature of the role types will allow the "creator" to have all the
   privileges of the "moderator".

4.3.  Moderator

   The role of "moderator" is used to identify the logical entity that
   will manage the conference.  The "moderator" is in essence the
   'facilitator' of the conference.

   The "moderator" is an OPTIONAL role, but if specified in the
   conference template, the "moderator" SHOULD attend the meeting.

Internet-Draft                Roles in XCON                 October 2005


   There may be multiple moderators in a conference.  For example, a
   conference may have two moderators: one controlling who can talk at a
   particular time and another controlling who can write on a shared
   whiteboard.

4.4.  Participant

   The role of "participant" is used to identify a logical entity with
   generic privileges that will be participating in a Conference
   Instance.  The "participant" is in essence an 'attendee' to the
   conference.

   The "participant" is a mandatory role, and MUST be defined in the
   conference template.  There SHOULD be basic levels of media streams
   and their associated stream-types defined for the role of
   "participant".

   There MAY be multiple participants in a conference.

4.5.  Observer

   The role of "observer" is used to identify a logical entity which can
   only receive media streams from the conference.  The "observer" is in
   essence a 'listener' to the conference.  An observer could be a
   person (supervisor) or a machine (call logger or recording device).

   The "observer" is an OPTIONAL role, but there may be multiple
   observers in a conference.  The "observer" only receives input media
   streams and MUST NOT generate output streams.


5.  Roles in a Floor

   Floor control in centralized conferencing is introduced in the XCON
   Framework Document [1] and described in further detail in the Binary
   Floor Control Protocol (BFCP) [7].  Floors can be specified in the
   conference template [6] or created dynamically.  Users can be added
   or deleted from a floor when the conference is active.

   A floor chair is a logical entity that manages a floor (grants,
   denies, or revokes a floor).  The floor chair is usually in an
   "administrator", "moderator", or "creator" role.  A floor participant
   is a logical entity that requests floors, and possibly information
   about them from a floor control server.  They are usually in a
   "participant" or even a "moderator" role [7].

   In the conference scenarios [3], the 'lecturer' is seen/heard by the
   conference participants and often shares a presentation or



Morgan & Novo            Expires April 20, 2006                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                Roles in XCON                 October 2005


   application with the other participants.  A 'lecturer' is a logical
   entity that has been granted the floor within a conference by the
   floor chair.  It can be the "administrator", "moderator",
   "participant", or "moderator" role in the conference.  The 'lecturer'
   MAY also be referred to as a 'presenter'.

   Users in a conference MAY assume different roles in different floors.
   They MAY also assume different roles in the same floor, as floor
   transactions are processed.


6.  Changing Roles

   As mentioned previously, users can change roles during a conference.
   This can be done in one of two ways.  First, the user can join a new
   floor in a different role.  Second, an "administrator" can
   dinamically change that user's role.  This can be accomplished before
   the conference is instantiated, or during the conference, using an
   appropriate conference control protocol [9], [10].  A logical entity
   whose role has been changed will typically have access to the media
   streams associated with that role.

   It should be noted that when a logical entity is granted the floor in
   an active conference, their role does not change.  A user's role also
   does not change when they are either granted conference controls, or
   conference controls are enabled by the "administrator" or "moderator"
   while the conference is active.


7.  XML Schema Definition

   This section provides the XML schema definition for type 'role-type'.
   This schema will be called role-schema.xsd.


   <xs:schema targetNamespace="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:role-schema";
    xmlns=" urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:role-schema";
    xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema";>

    <xs:simpleType name="role-type">
       <xs:restriction base="xs:string">
         <xs:enumeration value="Administrator"/>
         <xs:enumeration value="Creator"/>
         <xs:enumeration value="Moderator"/>
         <xs:enumeration value="Participant"/>
         <xs:enumeration value="Observer"/>
       </xs:restriction>
    </xs:simpleType>

Internet-Draft                Roles in XCON                 October 2005


   </xs:schema>



8.  Extensibility of the Schema

   As defined in the XML schema definition above, the 'role-type' MUST
   have five values.  Future extensions to this schema may define new
   values and register them with IANA.  A hypothetical example for a
   schema extension for a new role-type value of "sub-administrator" is
   shown below:


   <xs:schema targetNamespace="...";
    xmlns="...";
    xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema";>

    <xs:redefine schemaLocation="role-schema.xsd">
     <xs:simpleType name="role-type">
      <xs:restriction base="xs:string">
      <xs:enumeration value="sub-administrator"/>
      </xs:restriction>
     </xs:simpleType>
    </xs:redefine>
   </xs:schema>



9.  Security Considerations

   A good discussion of appropriate security considerations between
   clients and the conferencing server can be found in [7].


10.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a new XML schema as per the guidelines in RFC
   3688[4].
