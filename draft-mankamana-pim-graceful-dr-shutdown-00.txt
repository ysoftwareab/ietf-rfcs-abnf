                PIM Designated Router graceful shutdown
              draft-mankamana-pim-graceful-dr-shutdown-00

Abstract

   On a multi-access network, one of the PIM routers is elected as a
   Designated Router (DR).  On the last hop LAN, the PIM DR is
   responsible for tracking local multicast listeners and forwarding
   traffic to these listeners if the group is operating in PIM-SM.  In
   case of a network maintenance, where we want to bring down the
   current DR, there is currently no way to gracefully handover the PIM
   DR role to a new DR on the shared LAN.  In this document, we propose
   a modification to the PIM-SM protocol that allows PIM DR to
   gracefully shutdown or go down for maintenance.  We also provide a
   procedure for PIM DR to gracefully handover its role to a new PIM DR
   in the network.

1.  Introduction

   On a multi-access LAN such as an Ethernet, one of the PIM routers is
   elected as a DR.  The PIM DR represents the LAN segment/broadcast
   domain in the PIM topology tree and has two roles to play in the PIM-
   SM protocol.  For sources connected to the segment, the PIM DR is
   responsible for registering one or more active sources with the
   Rendezvous Point (RP) if the group is operating in PIM-SM.  In
   addition, on the last hop LAN, the PIM DR is responsible for tracking
   local multicast listeners and forwarding data traffic to these
   listeners if the group is operating in PIM-SM.

Internet-Draft   PIM Designated Router graceful shutdown       July 2018


   Consider the following last hop LAN in Figure 1:

                            ( core networks )
                              |     |     |
                              |     |     |
                             R1    R2     R3
                              |     |     |
                           --(last hop LAN)--
                                    |
                                    |
                            (many receivers)

                       Figure 1: Last Hop LAN

   Assume R1 is elected as the Designated Router.  According to
   [RFC4601], R1 will be responsible for forwarding traffic to that LAN
   on behalf of any local members.  In addition to keeping track of IGMP
   and MLD membership reports, R1 is also responsible for initiating the
   creation of source and/or shared trees towards the sources or the
   RPs.

   If R1 needs to go on planned maintenance, the current approach is to
   lower the DR priority which would make sure that another PIM router
   on the LAN gets elected as the new DR and starts forwarding multicast
   traffic.

   With this approach, R1 gives away DR role as soon as new priority is
   configured and a new PIM DR (lets assume R3) starts building a
   multicast tree and starts forwarding multicast traffic on the LAN.
   However, this could cause traffic disruption for the duration it
   takes for R3 to build the upstream multicast tree.

   This draft defines a mechanism in the PIM protocol to handover DR
   role gracefully and as a result minimize traffic disruption.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]  .

   With respect to PIM, this document follows the terminology that has
   been defined in [RFC4601] and [RFC7761] .  Many places this draft
   would refer to PIM RFC [RFC4601] but it MUST be considered [RFC7761]
   as well.

3.  Protocol Specification

   In this draft, we define a new hello option to enable the graceful
   handover of a DR during planned maintenance.In Section 3.1, we
   describe the proposed mechanism.  In Section 3.2, we evaluate the
   impact of the mechanism on the network under different conditions.
   Section 4 describes the proposed hello option.

3.1.  Proposed Mechanism

   1.  In Figure-1, assume that R1 is current PIM DR that needs to go on
       planned maintenance.  R1 MUST sends out a PIM Hello with option
       described in Section 4.  The DR Priority MUST be set to 0.  R1
       MUST also set its assert metric to (PIM_ASSERT_INFINITY - 1)

   2.  The PIM assert metric modification would make sure that R1 does
       not become an assert winner

   3.  Sending DR priority as 0 would make sure to have default
       transition in case new DR does not support the new specification

   4.  The current PIM DR (R1 here) MUST not stop forwarding traffic to
       intended receivers unless it starts getting duplicate flows from
       newly elected PIM DR.

   5.  A failsafe timer SHOULD be used to stop forwarding multicast
       traffic towards receiver.  It SHOULD be set to at least two PIM
       Hello intervals.  But it SHOULD also be a configurable value.

3.2.  Impact on the network

   This section covers impact of PIM hello with Section 4 option

3.2.1.  Every PIM router supports the new specification on the shared
        LAN

   1.  In Figure-1, if each of the PIM routers on shared LAN supported
       this specification, new DR election would be done as per
       [RFC4601]

   2.  The newly elected DR MUST start building the multicast tree
       towards the source/RP.  It MUST start fail safe timer (default
       value 2 PIMHello interval) and MUST not generate a data driven
       assert.  Once the timer expires, it can move back to the default
       assert mechanism.  The reason to avoid an assert is to allow the
       old PIM DR on LAN to forward multicast traffic until such time
       the new DR is completely ready to forward multicast traffic.

   3.  It MUST forward multicast flow to receivers as soon as it gets
       the multicast flow from the source/RP

3.2.2.  Hybrid shared LAN, some of PIM router does not support
        specification

   There are two cases to consider,

   1.  If the new DR supports this specification, it would follow
       Section 3.1

   2.  If the new DR does not support this specification, there is no
       need for any special handling as the new DR would take over as it
       does today.  It would assert as soon as it gets elected as DR and
       the old DR would become the assert loser as it had already
       adjusted its assert metric to PIM_ASSERT_INFINITY - 1

5.  IANA Considerations

   A new PIM Hello option is TBD..

6.  Security Considerations

   Security of the new PIM Hello Options is only guaranteed by the
   security of PIM Hello message, so the security considerations for PIM
   Hello messages as described in PIM-SM [RFC4601] apply here.
