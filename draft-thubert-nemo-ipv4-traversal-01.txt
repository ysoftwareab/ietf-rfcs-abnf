Abstract

   Since IPv6 connectivity is not yet broadly available, there is a need
   in NEMO for a simple technology that allows a MIPv6 based Mobile
   Router to roam over IPv4 networks.

   The Doors Protocol proposed in this memo allows an arbitrary Mobile
   Node to roam even within private IPv4 address spaces, across both
   Network Address Translations (NAT), reverse NAT, and even Port
   Address Translation (PAT), in order to cope with the reality of
   today's Internet.

Internet-Draft                    Doors                         May 2003


1. Introduction

   This document assumes that the reader is familiar with Mobile IPv6
   defined in [12], with the concept of Mobile Router (MR) and with the
   Nemo terminology defined in [13], as well as IPv4 Network Address
   Translation (NAT) and Port Address Translation (PAT).

   During the transition phase from IPv4 to IPv6, hot spots that
   actually provide IPv6 connectivity will be scarce and Mobile Routers
   should support an alternate roaming technology over IPv4.

   There is an existing panel of solutions from the V6 ops (ISATAP,
   6to4, TEREDO), but these solutions fail to traverse in a simple
   fashion all types of NAT and PAT that are heavily deployed today.

   There is a real value in combining MIPv6 and IPv4 traversal
   technologies.  MIP brings a MN-HA tunnel and a binding cache into the
   picture, as well as a keep alive procedure.  The MIP cache can be
   used to store the PAT/NAT states, while the Binding flow can be tuned
   to keep the PAT/NAT active.  As a result, it is possible for a IPv6
   Mobile Router to traverse PAT/NAT with no protocol overhead or
   additional states in the network.

   The Doors Protocol developed in this draft extends Mobile IPv6 and is
   more particularily aimed at the Nemo problem space.  Some
   restrictions apply that could be circumvented by additional work.

2. Terminology and concepts

2.1 Doors Handle

   Doors inherits from 6to4 [10], that uses synthetized IPv6 addresses
   to build automatic tunnels across IPv4.  In the Doors case, that IPv6
   global unicast address is named a Doors Handle.  The Doors Handle
   follows the 6to4 formatting rules, but it points on a IPv4 (UDP)
   tunnel, as opposed to an interface on a machine.

   Due to a NAT/PAT or reverse NAT traversal, the handle may be subject
   to IPv6 level Address Translation.  Since we do not want to
   reintroduce the complexity of Application Level Gateways, the handle
   MUST NOT to be used as source or destination address as seen by upper
   layer protocols.

   Rather, the only use of a Handle is as a CareOf address for Mobile
   IPv6 as defined in [12].  Note that some ICMP messages such as DHAAD
   may be need the Handle as source or destination.  In that case, the
   ICMP layer chacksum must be updated when the Handle is modified.

2.2 Other definitions

   DoG

      The Doors Gateway (DoG) is the function that terminates the Doors
      Tunnel on both Home and Mobile ends.  The DoG performs IPv4/UDP
      automatic tunneling and a IPv6 level Network Address Translation.

   DooR

      A Doors Router (DooR) is a router that implements the Doors
      Gateway.  The Door is connected to the Home Network via the IPv6
      infrastructure.  A Home Door may be implemented at the ingress of
      the Home Network.  But Exit Doors may also be implemented at by
      private networks in order to avoid IPv4 NAT and PAT operations.
      In that case, the IPv4 address of the Exit Door should be
      available dynamically, for instance by means of DHCP or IPCP
      extensions.

   Doors Tunnel

      The Doors Tunnel is an IPv4/UDP automatic tunnel that encapsulates
      a Mobile IPv6 tunnel.  The Tunnel has two Directions, InDoors and
      OutDoors.

   InDoors and OutDoors

      A packet going InDoors flows between the Mobile Node and the Door.
      A packet going OutDoors flows between the Door and the Mobile
      Node.  In both cases, the packet is formed by an IPv6 packet that
      is encapsulated over IPv4 and UDP.  A packet flowing InDoors as a
      source IPv6 address that is a Doors Handle.  Reciprocally, a
      packet flowing OutDoors as a destination IPv6 address that is a
      Doors Handle.  InDoors and OutDoors are mutually exclusive.

   Doors Prefix

      The prefix of a Doors Handle.  It is a /64 prefix built with the
      Door IPv4 address an an arbotrary the SLA ID.  This prefix is
      assigned to the interface that owns the associated IPv4 address.
      if the IPv4 address is private, the prefix distribution MUST be
      limited accordingly, which prevents Route Optimization.


3. MIPv6 Doors support

   With Doors, a roaming MIPv6 Mobile Node generates a Doors Handle and
   uses it as CareOf to Bind over a Doors Tunnel to its Home Agent.

3.1 Known Restrictions

   Since the CareOf can be translated on the way, it may cause problems
   to Authentication Header and upper layer checksum computations.  So
   the CareOf can not be included in the signed information.  As a
   result, the reference packet for AH is always a packet where the IPv6
   source and destination addresses are the Home Address of the MN and
   the address of the HA, and the slots and segment left of a Routing
   Header are set to 0.  This is true for RH type 2 and the Reverse
   Routing Header defined in [14].

   In any case, the Doors prefix must be reachable at IPv6 level from
   the Home Agent, and from the Correspondent Nodes in case of Route
   Optimization (RO).  This is why RO may not be possible if the Handle
   is based on a private address, which may occur if the Door is behind
   a reverse NAT.

3.2 Operation for a MIPv6 Mobile Node roaming over IPv4

   A MN roaming generates its Doors Handle as follows:

        16         32        16      16         32         16    bits

     |      |     addr     |     || Port |     addr     | Port |
     +------+--------------+-----++------+--------------+------+

                        MR Doors Handle

      Door IPv4 address: the public address of the door.

      Doors Port: DOORSPORT

      MN IPv4 address: the private IPv4 CoA obtained by the mobile
      router on his roaming interface by any mechanism (configuration,
      DHCP, IPCP, ...).  Maybe private.

      MN UDP port: A value chosen dynamically by the Mobile Node.  It
      may be a signature used for verification purposes.

   The Mobile Node may recompute a new port periodically, build a new
   CareOf and rebind.

   The Mobile Node MUST be tuned to send Binding Updates often enough to
   make sure that the NAT/PAT states are kept alive.  As a result, there
   is no additional control traffic for that purpose.

3.2.1 MR Sending packets over the Doors tunnel

   The Doors Tunnel can be seen as an internal hop between the Mobile
   Node and its CareOf.  With that acceptation, the MIPv6 model, between
   the CareOf and either the Home Agent or an arbitrary Correspondent
   Node, still applies.

   When sending or forwarding a IPv6 packet with a Source address that
   is a Doors Handle, a Mobile Node MUST encapsulate the packet into a
   IPv4/UDP tunnel using the following settings:

   <-- outer IPv4 header -> <-UDP ports-> <in.IPv6 header->
   +----+--------+--------+ +-----+-----+ +----+----+-----+ +-----+-------
   |    |        |        | |     |     | |    |    |     | |
   |oNAF| oSRCV4 |oDESTV4 | |SPort|DPort| |iNAF|iSRC|iDEST| |  Payload
   |    |        |        | |     |     | |    |    |     | |
   +----+--------+--------+ +-----+-----+ +----+----+-----+ +-----+-------

                           InDoors Packet

      NAF represents the Non-Address Fields of a IP header

      Sport is the UDP Source port, set to the MN UDP port from the
      Handle

      DPort is the UDP Destination Port, set to the Doors Port from the
      Handle

      SRCV4 is the Source IPv4 address, set to the MN IPv4 address from
      the Handle

      DESTV4 is the Destination IPv4 address, set to the Door IPv4
      address from the Handle.

      SRC is the IPv6 Source Address, set to CoA == Doors Handle

      DEST is the Home Agent Address

      The Payload may be Home Address Dest Option and a Mobility Header
      or a IPv6 packet from a Node in the Mobile Network

   This causes packets in the MN-HA tunnel to be automatically
   reencapsulated into an IPv4/UDP tunnel to the HA IPv4 address, as
   long as the CareOf Address is a Doors Handle.

   Fragmentation may occur at IPv6 and/or at IPv4 encapsulation level.
   the rules defined in [7] and [10] apply respectively.

3.2.2 MR Receiving packets over the Doors tunnel

   The process of terminating the Doors tunnel on the MN side is:

      Decapsulating the IPv6 packet from the IPv4/UDP encapsulation

      Recomposing the original IPv6 address as known on the MN side.

      Recomputing the checksum of ICMP messages.

   When receiving a packet over UDP with Source Port equal to DOORSPORT,
   a Mobile Node checks whether there's an inner IPv6 packet with a
   Destination IPv6 address that is actually a Doors Handle.

   If so, the MN restores it by:

      Overwriting the MN IPv4 address and UDP port fields in the handle
      with the IPv4 Destination information from the received packet

      Overwriting the Door address and UDP port fields in the handle
      with the UDP Source information from the received packet

   If the generated Doors Handle does not match its CareOf, the node
   drops the packet.

   Otherwise, the node decapsulates the UDP tunnel and receives the
   resulting IPv6 packet.  The next step is either yet an other level of
   decapsulation, or, if a RH type 2 is present, a forwarding to the
   next hop in the RH, that should be the node's home address.

   This causes the MN-HA tunnel to be automatically decapsulated from an
   IPv4/UDP tunnel as long as the Doors Handle is the CareOf.

3.3 Operation for the Door

   The Door does not need to keep any PAT/NAT related state since that
   information is stored as CareOf in the Binding Cache by the Home
   Agent and the Correspondent Nodes.

   The Binding Cache Entries are created regarlessly whether the CareOf
   is a Handle or a plain IPv6 address.  As a result, the gating factor
   to Doors scalability is MIP itself.

   When the support of Door is configured on a dual stack interface of a
   router, an IPv6 address is configured manually or automatically on
   that interface, based on the Door Prefix associated to the IPv4
   address of that interface, with a suffix of ::1.  The router MAY
   start redistributing the Doors prefix at that time.

3.3.1 Door Receiving packets over the Doors tunnel

   The process of terminating the Doors Tunnel on the Door side is:

      Decapsulating the IPv6 packet from the IPv4/UDP encapsulation

      Translating the original source IPv6 address into an OutDoors
      Handle.

      Recomputing the checksum of ICMP messages.

   When receiving a packet over UDP with Source Port equal to DOORSPORT,
   the DoG function in a HA checks whether there's an inner IPv6 packet
   with a Source IPv6 address that is actually a Doors Handle.

   If so, the Door translates the Handle by:

      Overwriting the MN IPv4 address and UDP port fields in the handle
      with the IPv4 Source information from the received packet.

      Overwriting the Door IPv4 address and UDP port fields in the
      habdle with the IPv4 Destination information from the received
      packet.

   As a result, the layout of the OutDoors Handle is as follows:

        16        32         16      16         32         16    bits
     +------+--------------+-----++------+--------------+------+
     |      |     Door     |     || Door |      MN      | MN   |
     | 2002 |     IPv4     | SLA || UDP  |    public    | PATd |
     |      |     addr     |     || Port |  (NATd) addr | Port |
     +------+--------------+-----++------+--------------+------+

                          Door Handle

      Doors Port: DOORSPORT

      Door IPv4 address: The IPv4 address of the Door.  Maybe private.

      MN IPv4 address: the public IPv4 address of the MN.

      MN UDP port: May have been PATed

   After computing the OutDoors Handle, the DoG decapsulates the UDP
   tunnel and forwards the resulting IPv6 packet.  If the HA or CN is
   collocated with the DoG, the packet is received, and in any case the
   OutDoors Handle is used as CareOf and stored in the binding cache of
   the destination.

3.3.2 Door Sending packets over the Doors tunnel

   Since the Door advertises the Door prefix, and since the OutDoors
   Handle belongs to that prefix, normal IPv6 routing take place between
   the HA or CN and the Door on the way to the MN.

   When forwarding a packet to a destination that is a OutDoors Handle,
   a router running as a Door checks whether it has an IPv6 connected
   route to that prefix.  If so, instead of looking up the Link Layer
   address of the Handle, it MUST encapsulate the packet over IPv4/UDP
   using the following settings:

   <-- outer IPv4 header -> <-UDP ports-> <in.IPv6 header->
   +----+--------+--------+ +-----+-----+ +----+----+-----+ +-----+-------
   |    |        |        | |     |     | |    |    |     | |
   |oNAF| oSRCV4 |oDESTV4 | |SPort|DPort| |iNAF|iSRC|iDEST| |  Payload
   |    |        |        | |     |     | |    |    |     | |
   +----+--------+--------+ +-----+-----+ +----+----+-----+ +-----+-------

                           OutDoors Packet

      NAF represents the Non-Address Fields of a IP header

      Sport is the UDP Source port, set to the Doors Port from the
      Handle

      DPort is the UDP Destination Port, set to the MN UDP port from the
      Handle

      SRCV4 is the Source IPv4 address, set to the Door IPv4 address
      from the Handle.

      DESTV4 is the Destination IPv4 address, set to the MN IPv4 address
      from the Handle

      SRC is the Home Agent Address

      DEST is the IPv6 Source Address, set to the mapped CoA == OutDoors
      Handle

      The Payload may start with a Routing Header of type 2, or be a
      IPv6 packet from a Node in the Mobile Network

   When applied to Nemo, between a Mobile Router and its Home Agent, the
   Doors protocol maintains a single state in the PAT/NAT for all the
   communications of all the Mobile Network Nodes.

3.4 Advantages of the Doors protocol

   This solution presents a number of advantages:

      This solution does not keep states in the gateways.  The NATed
      addresses are stored and maintained in the MIP binding cache, only
      as long as they are needed, by the Mobile IPv6 protocol.  Note
      that in case of a symmetrical PAT, the CNs and the HAs may not see
      the same CareOf for a same MN.

      The MN may swap its Doors Gateway whenever it needs, since this
      will seen as yet an other roaming.  In particular, the address of
      a local Doors Gateway may be available in a DHCP or a IPCP
      extension.

      The transition between Doors or between IPv4 and IPv6 roaming is
      smooth, handled by the DoG function, transparently to the HA and
      CN support.

      There is only one entry in the NAT/PAT gateway for a full Nested
      Nemo configuration with no route optimization.  This limits the
      size of the tables that the NAT gateway has to maintain.


4. IANA considerations

   A port number value is required for DOORSPORT.  Note that this
   requirement could be alleviated by a common configuration on both
   sides, but this makes the deployment a bit more complex.

   Today we use TLA of 02 which is reserved to 6to4.  We see Doors as a
   subset of the general 6to4 prefix, but a Door can not function as a
   general purpose 6to4 gateway.  Is that worth using a different TLA?
