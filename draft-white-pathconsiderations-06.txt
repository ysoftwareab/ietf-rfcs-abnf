Abstract

   A good deal of thought has gone into, and is currently being given
   to, validating the path to a destination advertised by BGP.  The
   purpose of this work is to explain the issues in validating a BGP AS
   Path, in the expectation that it will help in the evaluation of
   schemes seeking to improve path validation.  The first section
   defines at least some of the types of questions a BGP speaker
   receiving an update from a peer not in the local autonomous system

Internet-Draft       Path Validation Considerations        February 2006


   (AS) could ask about the information within the routing update.  The
   sections following examine the answers to these questions in
   consideration of specific deployments of BGP.

   The examples given in this draft are intended to distill deployments
   down to their most critical components, making the examples easier to
   understand and consider.  In many situations, the specific path taken
   in the example may not be relevant, but that does not nullify the
   principles considered in each example.  It has been suggested that
   these examples are "red herrings," because they do not illustrate
   actual problems with specific policies.  On the contrary, these
   examples are powerful because they are simple.  Any topology in which
   one of these example topologies is a subtopology will exhibit the
   characteristics explained in this draft.  Rather than focusing on a
   specific topology, then dismissing that single topology as a "corner
   case," this draft shows the basic issues with assertions about the AS
   Path attribute within BGP.  These generalized issues can then be
   applied to more specific cases.


1.  Background

   With the heightened interest in network security, the security of the
   information carried within routing systems running BGP, as describued
   in [RFC1771], is being looked at with great interest.  While there
   are techniques available for securing the relationship between two
   devices exchanging routing protocol information, such as [BGP-MD5],
   these techniques do not ensure various aspects of the information
   carried within routing protocols are valid or authorized.

   The following small internetwork is used to examine the concepts of
   validity and authorization within this draft, providing us with
   definitions used through the remainder of the draft.

   10.1.1.0/24--(AS65000)---(AS65001)--(AS65002)

   Assume a BGP speaker in AS65002 has received an advertisement for
   10.1.1.0/24 from a BGP speaker in AS65001, with an AS Path of {65000,
   65001}.

1.1.  Is the Originating AS Authorized to Advertise Reachability to the
      Destination?

   The most obvious question the receiving BGP speaker can ask about
   this advertisement is whether or not the originating AS, in this case
   AS65000, is authorized to advertise the prefix contained within the
   advertisement, in this case 10.1.1.0/24.  Whether or not a BGP
   speaker receiving a route to 10.1.1.0/24 originating in AS65000 can

Internet-Draft       Path Validation Considerations        February 2006


   verify that AS65000 is, indeed, authorized to advertise 10.1.1.0/24
   is outside the scope of this draft.

1.2.  Is the Path Contained in the Advertised Routing Information Valid?

   If a BGP speaker receives an advertisement from a peer outside the
   local autonomous system (AS), the peer sending the update has a path
   to the destination prefix in the update.  Specifically, are the
   autonomous systems within the internetwork connected in such a way
   that the receiver, following the AS Path listed in the BGP update
   itself, can reach the originating AS listed in the received AS Path?
   Within this draft, this is called path validation.

   Path validation, in the context of this small internetwork, asserts
   that when a BGP speaker in AS65002 receives an advertisement from a
   BGP speaker in AS65001 with the AS Path {65000, 65001}, the speaker
   can assume that AS65001 is attached to the local AS, and that AS65001
   is also attached to AS65000.

1.3.  Is the Advertising Speaker Authorized to Transit Traffic Along the
      Advertised AS Path?

   If a BGP speaker receives an advertisement for a prefix from a
   speaker not in the local AS or the originating AS, is the receiving
   BGP speaker authorized to transmit traffic along the AS Path
   advertised in the update towards that destination?  Within this
   draft, this is called path authorization.

   Path authorization, in this small internetwork, asserts that if a BGP
   speaker in AS65002 receives a routing advertisement with the prefix
   10.1.1.0/24 and the AS Path {65000, 65001}, all speakers within
   AS65000 are authorized to forward traffic through the AS Path {65000,
   65001} towards 10.1.1.0/24.

1.4.  Is the Advertised Address Space Atomic?

   If a BGP speaker receives an advertisement for a prefix from a
   speaker not in the local AS, can the receiver infer path validation
   or path authorization for every possible subset of the advertised
   prefix?  This is a subtle version of the two questions asked in
   Section Section 1.2 and 1.3; since a prefix is actually a collection
   of destinations, rather than a single destination, is any policy,
   authorization, or validation available on the advertised prefix also
   applicable to every subset of reachable destinations within the
   prefix?  In this draft, this is called atomic validation.

   In this example, specifically, if a router in AS65002 receives a
   route from a BGP speaker in AS65001 advertising reachability to



White, et al.            Expires August 9, 2006                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft       Path Validation Considerations        February 2006


   10.1.1.0/24, and it can either validate or authorize the AS Path
   contained in the advertisement, can it then imply AS Path validation
   or authorization for 10.1.1.0/25 and 10.1.1.128/25?

1.5.  Will Traffic Forwarded to an Advertising Speaker Follow the
      Described AS Path?

   If a BGP speaker receives an advertisement from a peer not in the
   local AS, will traffic forwarded to the peer advertising the update
   will follow the path described in the AS Path?  In this draft, this
   is called forwarding consistency.

   In terms of the small example internetwork, if a BGP speaker in
   AS65002 receives an advertisement from a peer in AS65001 for the
   destination 10.1.1.0/24, with an AS Path {65000, 65001}, will traffic
   forwarded to the BGP speaker in AS65001 actually be forwarded through
   routers within AS65001, then AS65000, to reach their destination?

1.6.  Is a Withdrawing Speaker Authorized to Withdraw the Routing
      Information?

   If an advertisement is withdrawn, the withdrawing BGP peer was
   originally advertised the prefix (or was authorized to advertise the
   prefix).  This assertion is out of the scope of this draft.


2.  Analysis

   To begin, we review some of the concepts of routing, since we need to
   keep these concepts fixed firmly in place while we examine these
   questions.  After this, four examples will be undertaken with BGP to
   show why the second of two questions cannot be answered in a path
   vector routing system.  Finally, a short section on transitive
   authorization in a path vector protocol is provided, which considers
   the reasons behind the results we find in the examples.

2.1.  A Short Analysis of Routing

   Routing protocols are designed, in short, to discover a set of loop
   free paths to each reachable destination within a network (or
   internetwork).  The loop free path chosen to reach a specific
   destination may not be the shortest path, and it may not always be
   the "best" path (depending on the definition of "best"), but it
   should always be a loop free path, or routing, and the routing
   protocol, has failed.

   This sheds some light on the purpose of the path included in an path
   vector protocol's routing update: the path is there to prove the path



White, et al.            Expires August 9, 2006                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft       Path Validation Considerations        February 2006


   is loop free, rather than to provide any other information.  While
   Dijkstra's SPF and the Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL) both base
   their loop free path calculations on the cost of a path, path vector
   protocols, such as BGP, prove a path is loop free by carrying a list
   of nodes the advertisement itself has traversed.  BGP specifically
   uses an AS Path based mechanism to prove loop freeness for any given
   update so each AS along the path may implement local policy without
   risking a loop in the routing system caused by competing metrics.

   We need to keep this principle in mind when considering the use of
   the path carried in a path vector protocol, and its use by a
   receiving BGP speaker for setting policy or gauging the route's
   security level.

2.2.  First Example: Manual Intervention in the Path Choice

   In the small network:

                   +---(AS65002)---+
   (AS65000)--(AS65001)          (AS65004)--10.1.1.0/24
                   +---(AS65003)---+

   A BGP speaker in AS65000 may receive an advertisement from a peer
   that 10.1.1.0/24 is reachable along the path {65004, 65002, 65001}.
   Based on this information, the BGP speaker may forward packets its
   peer in AS65002, expecting them to take the path described.  However,
   within AS65001, the network administrator may have configured a
   static route making the next hop to 10.1.1.0/24 the edge router with
   AS65003.

   It's useful to note that while [RFC1771] states: "....we assume that
   a BGP speaker advertises to its peers only those routes that it
   itself uses...," the definition of the term "use" is rather loose in
   all known widely deployed BGP implementations.  Rather than meaning:
   "A BGP speaker will only advertise destinations the BGP process on
   the speaker has installed in the routing table," it generally means:
   "A BGP speaker will only advertise destinations that the local
   routing table has a matching route installed for, no matter what
   process on the local router installed the route."  A naive reaction
   may be to simply change the BGP specifications, and all existing
   implementations so a BGP speaker will only advertise a route to a
   peer if the BGP process on the router actually installed the route in
   the local routing table.  This, however, ignores the complex
   interactions between interior and exterior gateway protocols, which
   most often run on the same device, and the complexities of route
   origination.

   Although this is an "extreme" example, since we can hardly claim the



White, et al.            Expires August 9, 2006                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft       Path Validation Considerations        February 2006


   information within the routing protocol is actually insufficient, we
   will still find it instructive to examine this example in light of
   the questions outlined in Section 1:

   o  Is the AS Path valid?  The AS Path the receiving BGP speaker in
      AS65000 receives from its peer in AS65001, {65004, 65002, 65001),
      does exist, and is valid.
   o  Is the AS Path authorized?  Since we have no knowledge of any
      autonomous system level policy within this network, we have no way
      of answering this question.  However, considering that the path
      advertised by AS65002 towards AS65001 is different than the path
      trafic will actually take, it's difficult to see how path
      authorization could be accomplished in this situation.  Even if
      theBGP speaker in AS65000 could verify AS65001 is authorized to
      transit AS65002 to reach 10.1.1.0/24, this implies nothing about
      the authorization to transit traffic through the path traffic will
      actually take, which is through AS65003.
   o  Is the AS Path consistent with the forwarding path (does
      forwarding consistency exist)?  No; the advertised AS Path is
      {65004, 65002, 65001}, while the actual path is {65004, 65003,
      65001}.
   o  Is the routing information atomic?  In this example, the only
      route advertised is 10.1.1.0/24, and the advertisement of this
      route is consistent throughout the entire internetwork, so the
      routing information is atomic.

   From this example, we can see forwarding consistency is not possible
   to validate in a deployed network; just because a BGP speaker
   advertises a specific path to reach a given destination, there is no
   reason to assume that traffic forwarded to the speaker will actually
   follow the path advertised.  In fact, we can reason this from the
   nature of packet forwarding networks; each router along a path makes
   a completely separate decision about where to forward received
   traffic.  Any router along the path could actually change the path
   due to network conditions without notifying, in any way, upstream
   routers, so at any given time, an upstream router may be forwarding
   traffic along a path that no longer exists, or is no longer optimal,
   and downstream routers could be correcting the forwarding decision by
   placing the traffic on another available path unknown to the upstream
   router.

   As a corollary, we can see that authorizing transit through a
   specific AS Path is not possible, either.  If the source of a
   specific flow cannot know what path the traffic within that flow will
   take to reach the destination, then there is no meaningful sense in
   which downstream routers can authorize the source to use available
   paths for transiting traffic.

2.3.  Second Example: An Unintended Reachable Destination

   In this internetwork, we assume a single policy: The system
   administrator of AS65000 would not like the destination 10.1.1.0/24
   to be reachable from any autonomous system beyond AS65001.  In other
   words, 10.1.1.0/24 should be reachable within AS65001, but not to
   autonomous systems connected to AS65001, such as AS65002.

   10.1.1.0/24---(AS65000)---(AS65001)---(AS65002)

   The system administrator can implement this policy by casuing BGP
   speakers within AS65000 to advertise 10.1.1.0/24 to peers within
   AS65001 with a signal that the BGP speakers in AS65001 should not
   readvertise reachability this routing information.  For example, BGP
   speakers in AS65000 could advertise the route to 10.1.1.0/24 with the
   NO_ADVERTISE community attached, as described in [RFC1771].  If the
   BGP speakers in AS65001 are configured to correctly respond to this
   community (and we assume they are for the purposes of this draft),
   they should accept this advertisement, but not readvertise
   reachability to 10.1.1.0/24 into AS65002.

   However, unknown to the system administrator of AS65000, AS65001 is
   actually advertising a default route AS65002 with an AS Path of
   {65001}, and not a full routing table.  If some host within AS65002,
   then, originates a packet destined to 10.1.1.1, what will happen?
   The packet will be routed according to the default route from AS65002
   into AS65001.  Routers within AS65001 it will forward the packet
   along the 10.1.1.0/24 route, eventually forwarding the traffic into
   AS65000.

   o  Is the AS Path valid?  This is a difficult question to answer,
      since there are actually two different advertisements in the
      example.  From the perspective of the BGP speaker in AS65002
      receiving a default route in an advertisement from a peer in
      AS65001, the AS Path to the default route is valid.  However,
      there is no route to 10.1.1.0/24 for the BGP speaker in AS65002 to
      examine for validity, so the question appears to be out of scope
      for this example.
   o  Is the AS Path authorized?  In this case, is AS65002 authorized to
      transit all destinations falling within the default route through
      AS65001?  Since AS65002 cannot know every possible subnet of the
      default route (or longer prefix destinations within the default
      route), BGP speakers within AS65002 cannot know the policy related
      to each every possible destination contained within the default
      route.  AS Path authorization cannot be proven when information is
      removed from the routing system, as the route to 10.1.1.0/24 is
      removed from the advertisements transmitted to BGP speakers within
      AS65002.

Internet-Draft       Path Validation Considerations        February 2006


   o  Is the AS Path consistent with the forwarding path (is there
      forwarding consistency)?  From the perspective of a BGP speaker in
      AS65002, traffic forwarded to AS65001 towards a destination within
      10.1.1.0/24 is actually going to terminate within AS65002, since
      that is the entire AS Path for the default route.  However, this
      traffic actually transits AS65001 towards AS65000.  Therefore,
      forwarding consistency does not exist in this example.
   o  Is the routing information atomic?  The policies impacting
      10.1.1.0/24, which is contained within, or is a part of, the
      default route AS65001 is advertising to AS65002 are different than
      at least some of the other destinations contained within this same
      route.  Therefore, the routing information is not atomic; the
      policies for subsets within a route are different than the
      policies for the route itself.

   The basic problem here is that the system administrator assumes that
   if autonomous systems beyond AS65001 do not receive routing
   information for a specific destination, they will not be able to
   reach that destination.  While we can question the system
   administrator's assumption (and security sense), this example does
   point out fundamental issues in internetworks running BGP when viewed
   from a system level:

   o  Information is routinely removed from routing systems through
      aggregation, filtering, and other mechanisms.  Once the
      information is removed, there is no way to determine if the
      removal was intentional, unintentional, or malicious.  This has an
      impact on the ability to assert path authorization, as we see in
      the system administrator being unable to prevent AS65002 from
      transiting traffic through AS65001 to 10.1.1.0/24.
   o  Aggregation removes atomic policy from the routing system.  By
      definition, an aggregate route contains any number of longer
      prefix destinations, each of which may have their own
      authorization or validation, in terms of their individual AS
      Paths.  This implies that AS Path authorization is impossible in
      an environment where aggregation of routing information is taking
      place.
   o  The concept of prefix, or rather destination, ownership, is not
      clearly defined in routing systems.  Any given party controlling
      10.1.0.0/16 may authorize any other party to advertise
      10.1.1.0/24, which is a part of (or is contained within)
      10.1.0.0/16.  This is called the suballocation of a block.
      However, suballocation does not prevent the authorizing party from
      continuing to advertise reachability to the suballocated address
      space, because the authorizing party may still advertise an
      aggregate containing the suballocated address space.  Again,
      advertised address space may not be atomic.

2.4.  Third Example: Following a Specific Path

   This example is slightly more complex than the last two.  Given the
   following small network, assume that A and D have a policy of not
   transiting B to reach destinations within 10.1.1.0/25.
   10.1.1.0/25--A---B---C---D
                |       |   |
                E-------F---G

   Assume the following:

   o  A advertises 10.1.1.0/25 to B and E.
   o  B advertises 10.1.1.0/24 to C.
   o  E advertises the aggregate 10.1.1.0/24 to F.
   o  F advertises the aggregate 10.1.1.0/24 to C and to G.
   o  C advertises the aggregate 10.1.1.0/24 to D, but not the more
      specific 10.1.1.0/25.
   o  G advertises the aggregate 10.1.1.0/24 to D.

   D now has two paths to 10.1.1.0/24, both of which appear to transit
   the path {F, E, A} to reach destinations within 10.1.1.0/25.  What
   path will traffic forwarded to C destined to hosts within 10.1.1.0/25
   actually follow, however?  The best path to 10.1.1.0/25 from C is
   actually through B, so traffic forwarded from D to C and destined to
   a host within 10.1.1.0/25 will actually transit B, which is outside
   the original policy D stipulated.

   o  Is the AS Path valid?  Both {G, F, E, A} and {C, F, E, A} are
      valid AS Paths, so both AS Paths in this example are valid.
   o  Is the AS Path authorized?  In the sense that C and G are both
      authorized to transit F to reach destinations within 10.1.1.0/24,
      the AS Path is authorized in this example.  However, traffic
      forwarded to C, and destined to 10.1.1.0/25, does not transit F,
      so authorization to transit F is meaningless in this context.
      Therefore, in terms of authorization to transit the actual paths
      traffic will be forwarded along, the AS Path is not authorized.
   o  Is the AS Path consistent with the forwarding path (is there
      forwarding consistency)?  While C is advertising the AS Path {C,
      F, E, A} to D to reach destinations within 10.1.1.0/24, it is
      actually forwarding along a different path to some destinations
      within this advertisement.  Forwarding consistency does not exist
      within this internetwork.
   o  Is the routing information atomic?  The advertisement for
      10.1.1.0/24 implicitely contains reachability information for
      10.1.1.0/25.  Since A and D's policies towards destinations within
      10.1.1.0/25 are different than the remainder of the address space
      within 10.1.1.0/24, the routing information is not atomic.

2.5.  Fourth Example: Interior and Exterior Paths Mismatch

   This is the most complex example we will cover in this draft.  It can
   be argued that the configuration described in this example is a
   misconfiguration, but we have chosen this example for its simplicity,
   as an illustration of the complexity of the interaction between
   interior and exterior gateway protocols within an autonomous system.
   BGP route reflectors, particularly when configured in a hierarchy,
   provide many examples of forwarding inconsistency, but they are much
   more complex than this small example.

   In this diagram, routers are represented by letters, and autonomous
   systems by numbers.  So:

   o  Router A is in AS1
   o  Routers B, C, and D are in AS2
   o  Router E is in AS5

   Each router is using, as its best path to 10.1.1.0/24:

   o  Router E is using its local (intra-AS) path.
   o  Router C is using the path through AS3.
   o  Router D is using the path through Router E.
   o  Router B is using the path through Router E.

   Examining the case of Router B more closely, however, we discover
   that while Router B prefers the path it has learned from Router E,
   that path has been advertised with a next hop of Router E itself.
   However, Router B's best path to this next hop (i.e., Router E), as
   determined by the interior routing protocol, is actually through
   Router C. Thus, Router B advertises the path {2, 5} to Router A, but
   traffic actually follows the path {2, 3, 5} when Router B receives
   it.

   The system administrator of AS1 has determined there is an attacker

   in AS3, and has set policy on router A to avoid any route with AS3 in
   the AS_PATH.  So, beginning with this rule, it discards the path
   learned from AS9.  It now examines the two remaining paths, learned
   from AS2 (B) and AS6, and determines the best path is {2, 5}, through
   AS2 (B).  However, unknown to A, AS2 (B) is also connected to AS3,
   and is transiting traffic to AS5 via the path {2, 3, 5}.

   Returning to our questions:

   o  Is the AS Path valid?  The AS Path {2, 3, 5} is a valid AS Path.
   o  Is the AS Path authorized?  If A has a local policy permitting
      traffic to the destination advertised to transit through AS3, then
      the AS Path can be said to be authorized.  However, since A does
      not know that traffic is actually passing through AS3, there is no
      way for A to know if AS2 is authorized to transit traffic through
      AS3.
   o  Is the AS Path consistent with the forwarding path (is there
      forwarding consistency)?  The advertised AS Path is {2, 5}, while
      the traffic forwarded to the destination actually transits {2, 3,
      5}.  Forwarding is not consistent in this example.
   o  Is the routing information atomic?  Since only one destination is
      advertised, the routing information is atomic in this example.


3.  Summary

   The examples given in this draft are not the only possible examples
   of forwarding that is inconsistent with the advertised AS Path;
   [ROUTINGLOGIC] also provides some examples, as well.  [ASTRACEROUTE]
   provides some interesting background on the pratical impact of
   forwarding inconsistent with the advertised AS Path, in the context
   of attempting to trace the actual path of packets through a large
   internetwork running BGP as an exterior gateway protocol.

   By surveying these examples we find the following set of factors in
   common:

   o  In any situation where the actual path along which traffic will be
      forwarded is different than the AS Path advertised by a BGP
      speaker to a peer outside of the local AS, AS Path authorization
      loses any meaning, since the receiving BGP speaker cannot know if
      the actual path the traffic will follow is authorized, either
      based on local policy, the originator's policy, or the transited
      autonomous system's policy.
   o  In any situation where the routing information advertised by a BGP
      speaker to a peer outside the local AS is not atomic, AS Path
      authorization loses any meaning.  This is common in cases where
      routing information is aggregated, or in cases where longer prefix

      advertisements are not advertised but a shorter length prefix
      containing the longer prefix advertisement is advertised.
   o  The overlapping nature of address ownership causes serious
      problems with forwarding consistency and AS Path authorization.
