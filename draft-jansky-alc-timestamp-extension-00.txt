Abstract

   This document defines a variable length ALC PI specific LCT Header
   Extension, NTP Timestamp Header (EXT_NTP).  This extension can be
   used within an ALC session for multiple purposes, for example, to
   signal the last moment of time there was a change in the session.

1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].


2.  Introduction

   This document defines a variable length ALC PI specific LCT Header
   Extension, NTP Timestamp Header (EXT_NTP) [2].  This extension can be
   used within an ALC session for multiple purposes.  The semantics of
   the EXT_NTP can be declared within the Header Extension itself
   (through the "Use" field).

   Although the specification of EXT_NTP does not limit the use of the
   timestamp information any particular use, this specification defines
   one use - the signaling of the last moment of time there was a change
   in the session.  The purpose of that use of the EXT_NTP extension is
   to allow the sender of the ALC session to signal changes in the
   session for the receivers of the session.  This is particularly
   useful in the cases where the receivers of the ALC session
   sporadically enter and leave the session.  In such cases the receiver
   may receive the session for a period of time, stop reception for
   another period of time and continue reception again.  Examples of
   such cases are relatively long ALC sessions that deliver a number of
   Transport Objects so that the number of Transport Objects dynamically
   changes, or, cases where the receiver has temporary connection to the
   transmission medium.


3.  NTP Timestamp Header

   NTP Timestamp Header (EXT_NTP) is a variable length, ALC PI specific
   LCT Header Extension [2].  The Header Extension Type (HET) for the
   extension is 65.  Its format is defined as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   HET = 65    |     HEL = 2   |      Use      |   Reserved    |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                       NTP Timestamp                           |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Header Extension Type (HET), 8 bits:

   Value of this field MUST be set to 65.

   Header Extension Length (HEL), 8 bits:

   The length of the whole Header Extension field, expressed in
   multiples of 32-bit words.  For EXT_NTP, this field MUST be set to 2.

   Use, 8 bits:

   This field expresses the exact semantics how the sender of the ALC
   session intens the receiver to interpret the use of the timestamp.
   This specification defines the semantics for the case when "Use"
   equals "0".  Other values for this field are possible but not in
   scope of this specification.

   Reserved, 8 bits:

   This field is reserved for future use and SHOULD be set to 0.

   NTP Timestamp, 32 bits:

   The value of this field is to be interpreted as the seconds-part (32
   most significant bits) of NTP timestamp [3].  When the field When use
   equals "0", this timestamp signals the NTP time the ALC session was
   last changed.  That is, it expresses the last moment of time a
   Transport Object was added to the session for delivery.

   The EXT_NTP MAY be carried in any ALC packet delivered within the ALC
   session.  This specification does not define further guidelines on
   how frequently or when to use the EXT_NTP as these choices are
   depenent on the usage scenario of the extension.


4.  Security Considerations

   As the NTP Timestamp Header is to be used with ALC packets within ALC
   sessions, the security considerations of ALC apply.  Beyond that,
   there are no further security considerations related to this header
   extension.
