          RADIUS Extensions for Manufacturer Usage Description
                        draft-weis-radext-mud-00

Abstract

   A Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) is a file describing the
   expected use of a class of devices, usually an Internet of Things
   class of devices.  It is prepared by a manufacturer and placed on a
   generally available web server, and is addressable via a Uniform
   Resource Identifier (URI).  The URI is often included in a discovery
   protocol (e.g., DNS, LLDP).  A Network Access Server (NAS) in the
   path of the discovery protocol can collect and forward the URI to a
   RADIUS server, which processes the URI.  This draft defines the
   RADIUS extension needed for the NAS to forward the URI to the RADIUS
   server.

1.  Introduction

   Enterprise networks often use Port-Based Network Access Control
   [IEEE802.1X], where the Authentication Server is a RADIUS server
   [RFC2865].  In some cases a device will authenticate itself to the
   network using IEEE 802.1X with a digital certificate (e.g., an IEEE
   802.1AR Secure Device ID [IEEE802.1AR]) that has been placed into the
   device by the manufacturer.  Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD)
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-mud] has defined an optional extension for digital
   certificates, which consists of a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
   that identifies the MUD file.  A MUD file contains identification and
   network access information for a particular class of device.  This
   information can be used to generate authorization policy such as an
   Access Control List (ACL) describing required network access for the
   device.

   However, there are cases where a MUD URI is not included in a
   device's digital certificate, or it does not support the use of
   digital certificates, or may not even support an IEEE 802.1X
   Supplicant.  This will often be the case with IoT devices, which is a
   primary use case for the use of MUD.  In each of these situations, a
   device could benefit from distributing a MUD URI in a discovery
   message (e.g., a DHCP or LLDP message as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-mud]), in hopes that a network element device will
   receive and consume it.

Internet-Draft                 RADIUS-MUD                   October 2016


   As shown in Figure 1, a Network Access Server (NAS) can observe the
   discovery message with the MUD URI and forward it to a RADIUS server.
   This can be done as part of a MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB)
   message.  MAB is a common alternative approach of port-based network
   access control used for devices that cannot support a IEEE 802.1X
   Supplicant.  The RADIUS server and an associated MUD Controller
   (defined in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-mud]) will work together to resolve the
   URI and translate the resulting MUD file into authorization policy.
   The RADIUS server distributes to the NAS authorization RADIUS
   attributes (e.g., an ACL describing required network access) to apply
   to messages received from the device.

                       Figure 1: RADIUS Message Flow

   The only missing piece in this workflow is the ability for the NAS to
   relay the MUD URI to the RADIUS server.  This draft defines a new
   RADIUS attribute for this purpose.  The expectation is that the MUD
   URI will be passed in Access Request or Accounting messages.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   The following key terms are used throughout this document:

   MUD Controller  An entity that requests a MUD file from the MUD
         server, and processes the MUD file upon receipt.

   MUD file  A file containing a MUD Yang file definition, as defined in
         [I-D.ietf-opsawg-mud]

   defined in Figure 2.

   0                   1                   2                   3

   Value

      A MUD URI as defined in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-mud], and MUST conform to
      the syntax defined a URI [RFC3986].

4.  MUD URI processing

   When a NAS receives a MUD URI, it forwards it to a RADIUS server
   using the Extended Attribute described in Section 3.

   When a RADIUS server receives a MUD URI, it works in conjunction with
   a MUD Controller to retrieve the MUD file and processes it as
   described in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-mud].  They determine filter policies
   based on the MUD file, and the RADIUS server passes these filter
   policies to the NAS using commonly used RADIUS filter attributes.

   Finally, the NAS receives the RADIUS filter attributes and applies
   them to the network traffic associated with the new device.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a RADIUS attribute, which does not affect the
   security considerations of the RADIUS protocol [RFC2865].

   Security considerations regarding the integrity of the MUD URI are
   outside the scope of this document, but it may be helpful to consider
   how a network using MAB might use a MUD URI.  When retrieved from an
   authenticated device a NAS does not absolutely know if this MUD file
   is correct for the device that proffers the MUD URI, but it can use
   the MUD file as a hint as to the type of device.  A NAS may be able
   to correlate the claimed device type with other policy for this
   device using other mechanisms.  It should also be noted that the
   intent of a MUD policy description is to severely limit the network
   access of the device (e.g., using filters), rather than grant wide
   access to a device.  Therefore, the action of proffering a MUD URI
   indicates a willingness to have its network access restricted rather
   than opened.

6.  IANA Considerations

   TBD1: One of the RADIUS Types that indicates an Extended Type

   TBD2: A RADIUS Extended Type value.
