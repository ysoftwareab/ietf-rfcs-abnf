INTERNET DRAFT       TRILL MPLS-Based Ethernet VPN      October 19, 2015


1  Introduction

   Pseudo Wire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) is a mechanism that
   emulates the essential attributes of a service such as Ethernet over
   a Packet Switched Network (PSN).  The required functions of PWs
   include encapsulating service-specific PDUs arriving at an ingress
   port, and carrying them across a path or tunnel, managing their
   timing and order, and any other operations required to emulate the
   behavior and characteristics of the service as faithfully as
   possible.

   The IETF Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL)
   protocol [RFC6325] [RFC7177] [rfc7180bis] provides transparent
   forwarding in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topology and link
   technologies using a header with a hop count and link-state routing.
   TRILL provides optimal pair-wise forwarding without configuration,
   safe forwarding even during periods of temporary loops, and support
   for multipathing of both unicast and multicast traffic. Intermediate
   Systems (ISs) implementing TRILL are called Routing
   Bridges(RBridges)or TRILL Switches.

   VPLS, specified in [RFC4672], is a proven widely deployed technology.
   However, the existing solution has a number of limitations when it
   comes to redundancy, flow-based load balancing, multipathing and
   handling of BUM (Broadcast, Unknown Unicast, and Multicast) traffic. 

   The [draft-VTSD] introduces a new terminology called VTSD which is a
   replacement for VSI (Virtual Service Instance) in a traditional VPLS
   network. [draft-VTSD] states that a VTSD is a logical RBridge resides
   inside TIR (TRILL Intermediate Router) that should be capable of
   performing all the operations that a standard TRILL switch can do,
   along with IP and MPLS functions. A TIR is a Provider Edge (PE)
   device where VTSD resides and provides TRILL based EVPN solution. 

   The TRILL based EVPN solution is similar the to MPLS based L2VPN
   solution and uses MPLS L2VPN concepts like pseudowire, attachment
   circuit, PSN tunnel etc. TRILL EVPN requires extensions to existing
   IP/MPLS protocols as described in this document.  In addition to
   these extensions, EVPN uses several building blocks from existing
   MPLS technologies. The VSI in IP/MPLS L2VPN is replaced with VTSD.
   Replacing VSI with VTSD with TRILL EVPN brings some new features and
   advantages. This document states these advantages in detail. 

   TRILL as a protocol enables optimal use of the links in a layer2
   network and running TRILL inside the TIR or VTSD provides a way for
   optimally utilizing the following:

       1. The PWE3 mesh connectivity in the VPLS core using parallel

   pseudowires.

       2. The PWE3 attachment circuit interface, when there are more
   than one attachment circuit interfaces using active-active
   pseudowires.

   When there is a requirement to increase the bandwidth of a particular
   pseudowire, with TRILL EVPN, new pseudowires could be created with
   the same endpoints and with different peer address. These pseudowires
   are termed as parallel pseudowires. As these pseudowires are attached
   to VTSD (which is a TRILL RBridge), the TRILL protocol takes care of
   optimally load sharing the traffic across these parallel
   pseudowires.

   Similarly when there is a requirement to increase the bandwidth of
   customer facing interface (attachment circuit), this can be achieved
   effectively by adding new attachment circuit interfaces and attaching
   them to the same VTSD of TRILL EVPN.

   The objective of a pseudowire (PW) connected in parallel or mesh is
   to maintain connectivity across the packet switched network (PSN)
   used by the emulated service. In this model all pseudowires that are
   part of a service domain will carry data traffic without making any
   of the pseudowire go in to standby mode.

                                 CE's 


2.  Appointed Forwarders


   TRILL supports multi-access LAN (Local Area Network) links that can
   have multiple end stations and RBridges attached.  Where multiple
   RBridges are attached to a link, native traffic to and from end
   stations on that link is handled by a subset of those RBridges called
   "Appointed Forwarders" [rfc6439bis], with the intent that native
   traffic in each VLAN be handled by at most one RBridge.  An RBridge
   can be Appointed Forwarder for many VLANs.

   The Appointed Forwarder mechanism is irrelevant to any link on which
   end station service is not offered.  This includes links configured
   as point-to-point IS-IS links and any link with all RBridge ports on
   that link configured as trunk ports. (In TRILL, configuration of a
   port as a "trunk port" just means that no end station service will be
   provided.  It does not imply that all VLANs are enabled on that
   port). Furthermore, Appointed Forwarder status has no effect on the
   forwarding of TRILL Data frames.  It only affects the handling of
   native frames.

   By default, the DRB (Designated RBridge) on a link is in-charge of
   native traffic for all VLANs on the link.  The DRB may, if it wishes,
   act as Appointed Forwarder for any VLAN and it may appoint other
   RBridges that have ports on the link as Appointed Forwarder for one
   or more VLANs.

INTERNET DRAFT       TRILL MPLS-Based Ethernet VPN      October 19, 2015


   The DRB may appoint other RBridges on the link with any one of the
   mechanism described in [rfc6439bis].  

   A RBridge on a multi-access link forms adjacency [RFC7177] with other
   RBridge if the VLAN's configured/enabled between them are common. For
   example there are four RBridges attached to multi-access link, say
   RB1, RB2, RB3 and RB4. RB1 and RB2 are configured with single VLAN
   "VLAN 2", whereas RB3 and RB4 are configured with "VLAN 3". Assume
   that there are no Native VLAN's present on any of the RBridges
   connected to multi-access link. Since TRILL Hellos are sent with VLAN
   Tag enabled on the interface, RB3 and RB4 drops the hellos of RB1 and
   RB2 (since they are not configured for VLAN 2). Similarly RB1 and RB2
   drops the Hellos of RB3 and RB4. This results in RB1 and RB2 not
   forming adjacency with RB3 and RB4. RB1 and RB2 after electing DRB
   and forming adjacency between them, will decide about VLAN 2 AF.
   Similarly RB3 and RB4 decide about the VLAN 3 AF.

   As VTSD should be capable of performing all the operations a standard
   TRILL Switch should do, it should also be capable of performing
   Appointed Forwarder selection. A group of VTSD that are configured
   for same service's (VLAN's in our case) on different TIR's will form
   adjacencies, whereas VTSD which are enabled for different VTSI will
   never form adjacencies.


3.  Multiple Parallel VPLS pseudowires.

   TRILL supports multiple parallel adjacencies between neighbor
   RBridges. Appendix C of [RFC6325] and section 3.5 of [RFC7177]
   describes this in detail. Multipathing across such parallel
   connections can be done for unicast TRILL Data traffic on a per-flow
   basis, but is restricted for multi-destination traffic. VTSD should
   also support this functionality.

   TRILL EVPN Pseudowires which belong to same VTSD instance in a TIR
   and connected to same remote TIR are referred to as parallel
   pseudowires. These parallel pseudowires corresponds to a single link
   inside VTSD. 

   Here all pseudowires should be capable of carrying traffic.

                 Figure 1: Parallel pseudowires with TRILL EVPN 



   In above Figure 1, PW1 and PW2 are parallel pseudowires, as these
   pseudowires belongs to same VTSD and provides a connectivity across
   same TIRs.

   This mechanism provides a way for actively increasing and optimally
   utilizing the bandwidth in the service provider network without
   affecting the existing traffic.

4.  Active-Active Pseudowire 

   [RFC6718] describes pseudowire Redundancy mechanism, wherein among
   the pair of pseudowires, one pseudowire will be selected as a active
   pseudowire and the other will be selected as a standby pseudowire.
   The standby pseudowire will not forward any user traffic under normal
   circumstances. The introduction of VTSD in TRILL EVPN provides a very
   simple mechanism for providing multiple active pseudowires.

   Pseudowires which belongs to the same VTSD instance inside the same
   TIR or between TIR's will be in active-active state. These
   pseudowires are able to carry data-traffic without making any one of
   pseudowire to go in standby mode.

   To distribute traffic between pseudowires, TRILL protocol will be
   used.

               Figure 2: Dual-Home AC with Active-Active PW's 



   In the above Figure 2, pseudowires PW1 and PW2 are in active state
   and will be capable of carrying user traffic without making anyone of
   the pseudowire go in standby mode.  The above Figure illustrates an
   application of multiple active pseudowires, where one of the CEs
   (CE1) is dual-homed.  This scenario is designed to actively load
   share the emulated service among the two TIRs attached to the multi-
   homed CE (CE1).  

   The attachment circuit can be of either Port-based Attachment Circuit
   or VLAN-based Attachment Circuit.


4.1. Port-based AC operations.

   In this case, the VTSDs in TIR1 and TIR2 will form TRILL adjacency
   via AC ports. If the attachment circuit port can carry N number of
   end-station service VLANs, then TIR1 and TIR2's VTSDs can equally
   distribute them using AF Mechanism of TRILL.


4.2. VLAN-based AC operations.

   Likewise in Port-based AC, in this case also the VTSDs in TIR1 and
   TIR2 will form TRILL adjacency via AC ports. Since only one VLAN end-

   station service is enabled, only one TIR's VTSD can become AF for
   that VLAN. Hence native traffic can be processed by any one of the
   AC.


5. MPLS encapsulation and Loop free provider PSN/MPLS

   TRILL with MPLS encapsulation over pseudowire is specified in
   [RFC7173], and requires no changes in the frame format.

   TRILL EVPN doesn't require to employ Split Horizon mechanism in the
   provider PSN network, as TRILL takes care of Loop free topology using
   Distribution Trees. Any multi-destination frame will traverse a
   distribution tree path. All distribution trees are calculated based
   on TRILL base protocol standard [RFC6325] as updated by [RFC7180bis].


6.  Frame processing

   This section specifies frame processing from CE's and TIR's


6.1. Frame processing between CE's and TIR's.

   In a multi-homed CE topology where in a CE is connected to two PEs /
   TIRs, AF mechanism described in section 2 will be used to decide
   which TIR/VTSD will carry the traffic for a particular VLAN. This is
   applicable to the case wherein a CE device is connected to a PE/TIR
   device via multiple layer 2 interfaces to increase the bandwidth.

   As a frame gets ingressed into a TIR (or any one of the TIR, when
   CE/CEs are connected to multiple TIR's) after having AF check, the
   TIR encapsulates the frame with TRILL and MPLS headers and forwards
   the frame on a pseudowire. If parallel pseudowires are present, the
   TRILL protocol running in VTSD will select any one of the pseudowire
   and forward the TRILL Data packet. Multi-destination packets will be
   forwarded on Distribution tree's path [rfc7180bis]

   The advantage of using TRILL for distribution of frames is, even if
   any of the paths or links fails between CE and TIR's or between
   TIR's, frames can be always be forwarded to any of available UP links
   or paths through other links/pseudowires.

   If multiple equal paths are available, TRILL will distribute traffic
   among all the paths. 

   Also VTSD doesn't depend on the routing or signaling protocol that is
   running between TIRs, provided there is a tunnel available with

INTERNET DRAFT       TRILL MPLS-Based Ethernet VPN      October 19, 2015


   proper encapsulation mechanism.

   Any multi-destination frames when ingressed to TIR's will traverse
   one of the Distribution-Trees, with strong RFC Checks. Hop count
   field in TRILL Header will avoid loops or duplication of Traffic. 



6.2. Frame processing between TIR's.

   When a frame gets ingressed into a VTSD inside TIR, the TRILL
   protocol will forward the frames to the proper pseudowire. When
   multiple paths / pseudowires are available between the TIR's then
   shortest path, calculated through TRILL protocol, will be used. If
   multiple paths are of equal cost, then TRILL protocol will do ECMP
   load spreading. If any multi-destination frame gets received by the
   VTSD through a pseudowire, TRILL will do an RPF check and will take
   proper action. 

   Once a frame gets to the VTSD through pseudowire, MPLS header will be
   de-capsulated, further action will be taken depending on the egress
   nickname field of TRILL header. If egress nickname is the nickname of
   this VTSD, MAC address table and AF lookup will be performed and the
   frame will be forwarded by decapsulating the TRILL header. If egress
   nickname belongs to some other VTSD, frame will be forwarded on a
   pseudowire connected to that VTSD by encapsulating with an MPLS
   header.



7. MAC Address learning and withdrawal.

   MAC address learning and withdrawal mechanism on a RBridge is
   specified in section 4.8. of [RFC6325], this document requires no
   changes for MAC address learning and its withdrawal.
