                   Network Path Requirements for QUIC
                     draft-wing-quic-network-req-00

Abstract

   As QUIC is deployed in more networks, some existing network path
   infrastructure will need to be updated.  This document describes a
   few ways QUIC might be modified to make these updates possible and
   palatable to the developers and operators that will need to make the
   changes.

1.  Introduction

   Middleboxes, especially firewalls and NATs, have contributed to the
   inability of the Internet to evolve
   [I-D.hildebrand-middlebox-erosion].  There is a strong desire to
   avoid this ossification with QUIC.  At the same time, there is a
   desire to treat QUIC better than normal UDP traffic; that is, to
   treat QUIC as well as TCP traffic.  Unfortunately, the lack of header
   information in QUIC prevents the network path from identifying QUIC
   traffic and prevents the path from treating QUIC as a transport
   protocol on par with TCP.

   Although it might be possible for path elements to heuristically
   perform their traditional roles, explicitly making the path a part of
   the QUIC architecture will generate a superior user experience.  Note
   that the information required to be exposed is *less* than TCP
   exposes, in order to enable future QUIC extensibility.

   This paper assumes that QUIC will use TLS 1.3 and that QUIC will not
   perform TLS session resumption when switching interfaces.

2.  Consent to Receive and Rate Limiting

   On many networks UDP is rate-limited or completely blocked, or a per-
   host or per-link basis.  The limits are imposed to prevent
   compromised hosts from generating high volumes of UDP traffic towards
   a victim [I-D.byrne-opsec-udp-advisory].  Some protocols are request/
   response and could have higher rate limits because consent to receive
   is visible to the path (e.g., DNS, NTP) but others are send-only
   (e.g., SNMP traps, SYSLOG).  The configuration expense and fear of
   ossification involved in deeper packet inspection is not commensurate

   with the benefit of higher rate limits for those request/response
   protocols, so many networks simply rate limit or block UDP.

   Unlike UDP, TCP has a clear consent-to-receive indicator, which is
   why TCP is not subjected to rate-limits on those same networks.  For
   TCP, the path can observe the consent to receive by patching
   acknowledgement numbers with their associated sequence numbers.
   WebRTC's data channel runs over UDP and has path-observable Consent
   Freshness [RFC7675] packets.  Multipath TCP (MPTCP [RFC6824]) sends
   its acknowledgements on the (reverse) path of the data, which
   provides a clear consent-to-receive indicator to the path.

   However, QUIC does not provide consent information visible to the
   path, and QUIC is silent if its own acknowledgements would be sent on
   the (reverse) path of the data.  Without this visibility, QUIC
   traffic that a host wants to receive cannot be distinguished from
   attack traffic.

      Recommendation: Provide path-visible consent request and consent
      acknowledgement for a given 5-tuple.

3.  Association with Existing Consent

   Once a consent to receive is established, multiple packets will
   usually be received in response to a single request.  In TCP, both
   the 5-tuple and the sequence numbers on a given packet are used to
   provide hints to the path about this association, in an attempt make
   the job of off-path attackers more difficult.  If QUIC does not allow
   the path to associate packets with a consent at greater assurance
   than just matching the 5-tuple (relying on the endpoint software to
   filter all attacks) the network cannot filter attacks such as denials
   of service.

      Recommendation: QUIC should allow path elements to associate every
      packet after the consent to receive with that consent, with more
      assurance than the 5-tuple.

4.  Long-lived Connections and HTTP Server Push

   Although the recommended UDP timeout for arbitrary ports is two
   minutes (Section 4.3 of [RFC4787]), some residential CPE devices have
   a 30 second timeout and a majority have a three minute timeout
   ([homeCPE], [tsvarea]).  Longer timeouts are provided to connection-
   oriented TCP -- 4 minutes during connection establishment and 2 hours
   after connection establishment [homeCPE].

   Such short timers are not a problem if the mapping is destroyed and
   the client sends data first, as a new mapping will be created and



Wing & Hildebrand       Expires December 16, 2016               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft     Network Path Requirements for QUIC          June 2016


   QUIC handles a new mapping (on a new UDP port or even on a new IP
   address) without an additional round-trip with its Connection Id.
   However, if the mapping is destroyed and the server sends data first,
   the server's packets will be dropped by the firewall or NAT.  This
   problem can be mitigated by (a) the client identifying its long-lived
   connections to the path (e.g., using PCP or UPnP IGD) or (b) by using
   an easily-identified QUIC header so the pat can hopefully identify
   that header and apply a longer, TCP-like mapping.  Neither is a
   perfect solution.  Note that heuristic NAT / firewall behavior
   discovery is tempting, but imperfect [RFC5780], leaving QUIC with
   sending occasional keepalives as the best assurance against mapping
   destruction (Section 8.10 of [I-D.tsvwg-quic-protocol]).

   Experience with TCP is that state needs to be retained after
   processing the initial session shutdown packet, to avoid half-closed
   sessions on the TCP endpoints.  Although QUIC's termination mechanism
   is simpler than TCP's, it is desirable to avoid causing half-closed
   sessions with QUIC.

      Recommendation: QUIC's public reset facility needs to describe
      timing recommendations for path state expiry.

5.  Identification

   The externally-visible QUIC version number is useful for future
   protocol agility.  However, as this is visible to the path, it is
   likely to ossify around that value.  Thus, having something else to
   identify QUIC is useful, so that the version number can change while
   retaining the same identification of a QUIC packet.

      Recommendation: Provide path-visible mechanism to identify a QUIC
      packet.

      Recommendation: Have a path-invisible version number.

6.  Spurious Packets

   A spurious packet may arrive when an endpoint (client or server):

   o  loses state due to a reboot

   o  experiences a QUIC application crash

   o  acquires another host's prior IP address

   o  receives a malicious or accidental QUIC packet.

Internet-Draft     Network Path Requirements for QUIC          June 2016


   In those cases, the host might have a QUIC application listening on
   that port, a non-QUIC application listening on that port, or no
   application listening on that port.  These are described below.

   QUIC application listening: If the application is expecting QUIC
   traffic and receives a spurious QUIC packet, the QUIC Connection ID
   will not match an existing Connection ID, and it should notify the
   QUIC sender.  However, QUIC cannot notify the sender because it lacks
   the necessary cryptographic information and may lack the full
   Connection ID (if the spurious packet used a truncated Connection
   ID).

      Recommendation: QUIC should have a mechanism for a QUIC
      application to send a hint to the remote system that its packet
      was not processed.

   Non-QUIC application listening: A non-QUIC application will not
   expect to receive a QUIC packet.  Upon receiving a QUIC packet, the
   application will attempt to parse the packet.  If the application
   generates a response, it will not match the QUIC Connection ID of the
   sender, and will be dropped by the QUIC sender.  It is unknown if
   receiving unsolicited QUIC packets causes problems for commonly-
   deployed UDP applications.

      Recommendation: Evaluate if receiving unsolicited QUIC packets
      causes new problems for existing UDP clients or UDP servers.

   No application listening: If there is no process listening on that
   UDP port, the host will generate an ICMP or ICMP6 error (destination
   unreachable, port unreachable), or due to policy reasons may not
   react at all.  Most operating systems allow non-privileged
   applications to receive and parse ICMP errors, allowing the QUIC
   stack to (partially) validate the returned ICMP error [ICMPTest],
   depending on the length of the returned ICMP message.

      Recommendation: QUIC applications should honor an ICMP hard error
      matching the 5-tuple of the remote peer and its recently-sent
      Connection ID, in a fashion similar to TCP's handling of ICMP hard
      errors (Section 4 of [RFC5927]).

7.  Path State Loss

   If a firewall, NAT, or load balancer discards its mapping state
   without notifying the endpoint, both endpoints can take a long time
   to discover the path state has been lost.  To avoid this delay, it is
   desirable to send a signal that the path state will be lost or has
   been lost.

      Recommendation: QUIC should provide a way for on-path middleboxes
      to signal that their mapping will be lost or has been lost.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document describes how QUIC needs to be distinguished from non-
   QUIC UDP traffic, so networks can defend themselves from attack and
   networks can defend hosts from attack.

   While beyond the scope of this document, there are a few other QUIC
   security considerations:

   o  Examine impact of CORS [CORS] to generate new UDP attacks against
      both clients and servers.

   o  Due to TCP attacks, TCP initial sequence numbers are now
      randomized.  QUIC should be analyzed if it would similarly benefit
      from randomized initial sequence numbers.

9.  IANA Considerations

   None.
