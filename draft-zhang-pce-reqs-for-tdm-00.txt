1. Introduction 

   As defined in [RFC4655], a Path Computation Element (PCE) is an 
   entity that is capable of computing a network path or route based on 
   a network graph, and of applying computational constraints during the 
   computation. Any node in the network can act as a Path Computation 
   Client (PCC) and request PCE to compute a path that satisfies the set 
   of constraints. When it finishes computing, the PCE will respond with 
   the path to the PCC. The communication protocol between PCE and PCC 
   has been described in [PCEP]. 

   The main work for PCE so far has been its application in MPLS 
   networks that are already stable and mature. However, the application 
   of PCE to GMPLS in packet and non-packet networks has also been 
   considered. GMPLS has more technology-specific and generic traffic 
   engineering constraints, and some of these, for TDM networks, need 
   further extensions to PCEP. 

   First, the properties of the LSP being computed should be fed to the 
   PCE from the PCC. These properties include the switching capabilities 
   (e.g., TDM, lambda, LSC, etc.), the encoding type (e.g., SDH/Sonet, 
   Digital Wrapper, lambda, etc.), and the signaling type (e.g., VC12, 
   VC3, ODUk, etc.). This information is very important for the PCE to

   compute a required Path. These properties are parameters are added to 
   PCEP in [PCEP-Layer]. 

   Second, the reliability of the network is very important for 
   transport networks. So the PCE should get information about required 
   level of protection for the LSP from the PCC. In TDM networks, there 
   are abundant protection types to satisfy different demand for the 
   service, for example, 1+1 protection, 1:1 protection, 1: n protection, 
   full rerouting, shared-mesh restoration, and segment recovery, etc.  
   This information is really important for PCE to compute the 
   corresponding work LSP and protection LSP correctly on operating the 
   traffic engineering database (TED). In addition, the link protection 
   also should be taken into account for PCE path computation. The 
   requirements for LSP protection type and link protection type are 
   addressed briefly in [PCE-App-Req]. 

   Third, in TDM networks (e.g., SDH/OTN networks), a client service can 
   be transmitted by various connection(s) of TDM with different 
   connection type. For example, in the SDH networks, if the client 
   service which is 100M Ethernet is required to be transported over the 
   SDH networks, the Ethernet service can be provided by a VC4 
   connection, and it can also be provided by three concatenated VC3 
   connections (Contiguous or Virtual Concatenation). So this 
   information about connection type is vital for PCE to compute the 
   correct LSP(s) to transport the service traffic. 

   The above three requirements are very important for PCE to compute 
   the desirable paths when PCE applied in the TDM networks. However, 
   the first two requirements are addressed partially in [PCEP-Layer] and 
   [PCE-App-Req], so this document focuses on the third requirement.  

1.1. Disposition of this Document 

   The material presented in this document is collected here for 
   analysis. The intention is to separate this material into separate 
   documents as follows: 

     -  Generic GMPLS requirements for PCEP will be merged into a single 
        document working with the authors of [PCE-App-Req]. 

     -  A new document will be created to provide generic GMPLS
        extensions to PCEP to address the generic requirements. 

     -  This document will be reduced to contain the TDM-specific 
        requirements (If needed, we can use one document to cover the

        TDM-specific requirements and extensions). 

     

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",   
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this   
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

3. PCE Applications 

   The TDM networks are usually responsible for transmitting data for 
   the client layer. These TDM networks can provide different types of 
   connections for customer services based on different service 
   bandwidth requests.  

   The applications and the corresponding additional requirements for 
   applying PCE in TDM networks are described below. In order to 
   simplify the description, this document just discusses the scenario 
   in SDH networks as an example. The scenarios in SONET or G.709 ODUk 
   layer networks are similar.

   bandwidth is required from A1 to A3 over this network. The client 
   Ethernet service could be provided by a VC4 connection from N1 to N3, 
   and it could also be provided by three concatenated VC3 connections 
   (Contiguous or Virtual concatenation) from N1 to N3.  

   The type of connectivity that is required (one VC4 or three 
   concatenated VC3) needs to be specified by PCC (e.g., N1 or NMS), but 
   could also be determined by PCE automatically based on policy, 
   configuration, or network capabilities. This is related to the 
   policies which can be implemented per [RFC5394]. The next section 
   lists requirements described according to different the policies that 
   are applied. 

4. Requirements 

4.1. Requirements when PCC Specifies the Connection Type 

   In this case, when receiving the service request from A1 to A3 from 
   client layer, the PCC (e.g., N1) specifies the transport scheme for 
   the service based on the requested bandwidth and the transport 
   policies pre-configured, and then requests the PCE to compute the 
   corresponding path. For example, the node N1 specifies that it needs 
   three virtual concatenated VC3 connections in the Path Computation 
   Request message to the PCE. Therefore, the following information 
   should be specified by PCC in the PCReq message: 

    (1) Signal Type: Indicates the type of elementary signal that 
        constitutes the requested LSP. A lot of signal types with 
        different granularity have been defined in SONET/SDH and G.709 
        ODUk, such as VC11, VC12, VC2, VC3 and VC4 in SDH, and ODU1, 
        ODU2 and ODU3 in G.709 ODUk. See [RFC4606] and [RFC4328] (Note 
        that switching capability and encoding type should also be 
        specified which are described in [PCE-App-Req]). 

    (2) Concatenation Type: In SDH/ SONET and G.709 ODUk networks, two 
        kinds of concatenation modes are defined: contiguous 
        concatenation which requires co-router for each member signal 
        and requires all the interfaces along the path to support this 
        capability, and virtual concatenation which allows diverse 
        routes for the member signals and only requires the ingress and 
        egress interfaces to support this capability. Note that for the 
        virtual concatenation, it also may specify co-routed or 
        separated-routed. See [RFC4606] and [RFC4328] about 
        Concatenation information. 
 
 
zhang                  Expires September 2009                 [Page 5] 

Internet-Draft   draft-zhang-PCE-reqs-for-TDM-00.txt        March 2009 
    

    (3) Concatenation Number: Indicates the number of signals that are 
        requested to be contiguously or virtually concatenated. Also see 
        [RFC4606] and [RFC4328]. 

   When receiving the PCReq message, PCE computes the path that 
   satisfies the set of constraints in the PCReq message. If successful, 
   the corresponding path will be returned to PCC in the PCRep message. 
   Note that the PCE should return the above information (Signal type, 
   Concatenation type, Concatenation number) in the PCRep message to 
   tell PCC how to create the corresponding connections. 

   In the case of virtual concatenation, when separate-routed paths are 
   required, it is necessary for the PCE to indicate that how many 
   member signals are needed in each route. For example, in Figure 1, if 
   the node N1 requests a virtual concatenation connection with four VC4 
   signals and these four VC4 member signals should be separated-routed, 
   the result of path computation may be two VC4 signals along the route 
   N1-N2-N3 and another two VC4 signal along the route N1-N5-N3. 

4.2. Requirements when PCE Determines the Connection Type 

   In this case, when receiving the request for a service from A1 to A3 
   from the client layer, the PCC (e.g., N1) sends the PCReq message to 
   the PCE. The message contains the information about requested 
   bandwidth, as described in [PCEP]. 

   When receiving the PCReq message, the PCE determines the transport 
   scheme for the service based on the requested bandwidth and the pre-
   configured transport policies, and then computes the path. If 
   successful, the information of the corresponding paths will be sent 
   to the PCC in the PCRep message.  

   In order that the PCC can set up the corresponding path, the PCE 
   should tell the PCC the transport scheme, i.e., the connection type. 
   So the PCRep message should contain the information described below: 

     (1) Signal Type: Same as described in Section 4.1. 

     (2) Concatenation Type: Same as described in Section 4.1. 

     (3) Concatenation Number: Same as described in Section 4.1. 

   In the case of virtual concatenation when separated routed paths are 
   returned, it is also necessary for the PCE to indicate that how many

Internet-Draft   draft-zhang-PCE-reqs-for-TDM-00.txt        March 2009 
    

   member signals are needed in each route, which is the same as 
   described in Section 4.1. 

5. Security Considerations 

   This document just focuses on the requirements when PCE is applied in 
   the TDM networks, so there is no additional security introduced. 
   Possible security issues should be considered when it need extend 
   PCEP to support these requirements. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   There is no IANA request in this document.
