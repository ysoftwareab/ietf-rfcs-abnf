1.  Introduction

   The sunset4 WG is working to define the complete transition of
   Internet to IPv6, covering a wide range of aspects, horizontal to
   several IETF areas.

   One of the main issues is to ensure that, when IPv4 is shutdown, or
   even during the transition phase towards that goal, all the services
   remain accesible by means of DNS.

   One of the alternatives is the use of NAT64 ([RFC6146]) and DNS64
   ([RFC6147]), which will help to ensure that, when a network or part
   of it, becomes IPv6-only, still can have access to IPv4-only
   resources.

   However, as DNS64 modifies DNS answers and DNSSEC is designed to
   detect such modifications, DNS64 can break DNSSEC.

   Furthermore, the deployment of those transition mechanism means that
   the cost of the transition is on the back of the service provider,
   because the investment required in the devices that take care of that
   transition services and the support of the call-centers to resolve
   issues.  So in the end, all that cost is indirectly charged to the
   end-user, which is unfair.

   It seems obvious that should not be that way, and the end-goal is a
   situation where we get rid-off IPv4-only services, and meanwhile, the
   cost borne by the IPv4 laggards operating those services.

   This document provides the steps to be able to tackle that situation
   and advance with the global IPv6 deployment in a fair way.

2.  Definition of IPv6-Ready DNS Infrastructure

   In the context of this document, and others that may be generated as
   a consequence of it, "IPv6-Ready DNS Infrastructure" means that a DNS
   server (root, TLD, authoritative NS) is fully accesible and

   operational if queried from a remote dual-stack and IPv6-only
   network.

   In general, that means having AAAA RRs in addition to A RRs, ensuring
   that PMTUD works correctly and fragmentation is correctly handled.

   In case DNSSEC is implemented with IPv4, it MUST support also
   IPv6-only operation according the below defined timing.

3.  Implementation timing

   Towards the implementation of the worldwide IPv6-Ready DNS
   infrastructure, the following deadlines are defined counting since
   the date this document becomes an RFC:

   1.  Root and TLDs MUST be IPv6-Ready in 6 months.

   2.  Authoritative NS MUST be IPv6-Ready in 12 months.

   3.  DNSSEC authoritative MUST be IPv6-Ready in 18 months.

   4.  Other A RRs, MUST be IPv6-Ready in 24 months.

   5.  Other RRs, MUST be IPv6-Ready in 30 months.

   Probing mechanisms to verify that the relevant AAAA are fully
   operational MUST be setup by IANA.  If there is a failure at the
   deadline in complying with those requirements, the relevant NS must
   be temporarily suspended until there is a subsequent successful
   verification.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not have any new specific security considerations.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA/ICANN is instructed by means of this document, to take the
   relevant measures for ensuring the steps towards the above indicated
   implementation timing.

   It is sugested that frequent warnings are provided to the relevant
   stakeholders, in advance to each of the deadlines.
