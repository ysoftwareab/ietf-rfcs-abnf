Internet-Draft                 EAP NEA TLV                  January 2011


1.  Introduction

   NEA has standardized a transport agnostic Posture Broker protocol
   defined in [RFC5793] to effect a network endpoint assessment between
   a Posture Broker Client and a Posture Broker Server.  The Extensible
   Authentication Protocol (EAP) [RFC3748] defines an authentication
   transport mechanism that can be extended to transport the Posture
   Broker Protocol. [draft-cam-winget-eap-tlv-01] defines an EAP-TLV
   container to carry arbitrary data within an EAP method.

   This document describes an EAP-TLV that can be used to carry Posture
   Broker messages within an EAP method.  This document also describes
   the capabilities and limitations of EAP as a transport mechanism for
   carrying NEA protocols.


2.  Specification Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] .


3.  EAP NEA TLV Format

   The NEA EAP TLV Format is defined and described below.  The fields
   are transmitted from left to right.

Internet-Draft                 EAP NEA TLV                  January 2011


         0  Optional TLV

         1  Mandatory TLV


      R

         Reserved, set to zero (0)


      TLV Type

         The EAP NEA TLV type:


         TBD


      Length

         The length of the Value field in octets.


      Version

         The one octet version of the EAP NEA TLV:


         1

      Reserved

         Reserved octect, must be set to 0x00


      PB-TNC Header

         The PB-TNC encapsulation header as described in [RFC5793].

      PB-PA Message

         The message between the Posture Broker Client and Posture
         Broker Server as described in [RFC5793].

4.  Capabilities and Limitations of EAP-TLV as a PT for PB-TNC

   TBD


5.  Security Considerations

   The EAP NEA TLV container carries network endpoint assessment
   information between the Posture Broker Client and the Posture Broker
   Server.  As some of this data can be sensitive, it is highly
   recommended that the EAP NEA TLV container MUST be carried inside a
   protected EAP tunneled method.

   To address the potential man-in-the-middle attack in a tunneled EAP
   method, the 'tls-unique' Channel Binding as defined in [RFC5929] MUST
   be used.


6.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is hereby requested to create a new registry for the EAP NEA
   TLV defined in Section 3.  The purpose of this registry is uniquely
   identify when NEA Posture Broker Protocol packets are being
   transported in an EAP method.

   Appala and Subbu Srinivasan for providing input into this draft.
