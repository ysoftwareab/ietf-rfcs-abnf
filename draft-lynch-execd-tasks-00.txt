Abstract

   This document identifies jobs originally assigned to the IETF
   Executive Director in existing IETF processes, and in most cases re-
   assigns them formally to the IETF Secretariat.  It updates RFC 2028,
   2418, 3005, 3710, 3777, 3929, and 3979.

Internet-Draft   Tasks previously assigned to the ExecD     January 2007


1.  Introduction

   BCP 101 [RFC4071] requires the IETF Administrative Oversight
   Committee to "designate, in consultation with the IAB and the IESG,
   the person or people who carry out the tasks that other IETF process
   documents say are carried out by the IETF Executive Director."  The
   purpose of this document is to document the agreed designations.

   The RFCs updated by this document are all those that have not already
   been obsoleted which assign tasks to the IETF Executive Director
   (sometimes abbreviated as ExecD).  Note that there is no relationship
   to the IAB Executive Director.

   In general the tasks concerned are well defined and closely linked to
   other duties of the IETF Secretariat.  Therefore, in what follows,
   almost all of them are re-assigned to the Secretariat.  It is
   expected that they will normally be performed by the person occupying
   the role of Head of Secretariat.


2.  Updated Task Assignments

2.1.  RFC2028: The Organizations Involved in the IETF Standards Process

   Original text:


 3.3  IETF Secretariat

    The administrative functions necessary to support the activities of
    the IETF are performed by a Secretariat consisting of the IETF
    Executive Director and his or her staff. The IETF Executive Director
    is the formal point of contact for matters concerning any and all
    aspects of the Internet standards process, and is responsible for
    maintaining the formal public record of the Internet standards
    process [B].


   Replaced by:


  3.3  IETF Secretariat

     The administrative functions necessary to support the activities of
     the IETF are performed by a Secretariat, which is the formal point
     of contact for matters concerning any and all aspects of the
     Internet standards process, and is responsible for maintaining the
     formal public record of the Internet standards process [B].

2.2.  RFC2418: IETF Working Group Guidelines and Procedures

   Original text


     The area directors sitting as a body, along with the IETF Chair,
     comprise the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG). The IETF
     Executive Director is an ex-officio participant of the IESG, as are
     the IAB Chair and a designated Internet Architecture Board (IAB)
     liaison.


   Replaced by:


      The area directors sitting as a body, along with the IETF Chair,
      comprise the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG).
      The IAB Chair and a designated Internet Architecture Board (IAB)
      liaison are ex-officio participants in the IESG. Secretariat
      staff participate in IESG business as needed.


2.3.  RFC3005: IETF Discussion List Charter

   Original text


    The IETF Chair, the IETF Executive Director, or a sergeant-at-arms
    appointed by the Chair is empowered to restrict posting by a person,
    or of a thread, when the content is inappropriate and represents a
    pattern of abuse.


   In this case, the reference to the Executive Director is simply
   deleted.  It is not appropriate to involve a staff person in posting
   rights decisions.

2.4.  RFC3710: An IESG charter

   This is an Informational RFC.  Original text:

Internet-Draft   Tasks previously assigned to the ExecD     January 2007


2.  The Composition of the IESG

   The IESG has the following members:

   o  The IETF Chair, who also functions as the General Area Director
      when this area is active

   o  The Area Directors (ADs) for the IETF Areas

   o  The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) Chair and the IETF Executive
      Director, as ex-officio members of the IESG

   The IETF Chair and the Area Directors are selected by the IETF NomCom
   according to the procedures of BCP 10 [3] (Nomcom procedures).

   The IETF Executive Director is the person charged with running the
   IETF Secretariat.


   The references to the Executive Director are deleted.  The final
   sentence becomes:


      Secretariat staff participate in IESG business as needed.


2.5.  RFC3777: IAB and IESG Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process

   Original text:


        1. The IETF Executive Director informs the nominating committee of
           the IESG and IAB positions to be reviewed.

           The IESG and IAB are responsible for providing summary of the
           expertise desired of the candidates selected for their
           respective open positions to the Executive Director.


   Both occurrences of "Executive Director" are replaced by "Head of
   Secretariat."

2.6.  RFC3929: Alternative Decision Making Processes for Consensus-
      Blocked Decisions in the IETF

   This is an Experimental RFC.  Original text:





Lynch (ed)                Expires July 22, 2007                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft   Tasks previously assigned to the ExecD     January 2007


    Volunteers to serve on the review team send their names to the IETF
    executive director.
    ...
    Each qualified
    volunteer sends her or his name to the working group chair and the
    IETF Executive Director within three weeks of the announcement sent
    to the IETF-announce mailing list.  The IETF Executive Director then
    uses the selection procedures described in [RFC3797] to select a
    single volunteer from the list.


   The references to the Executive Director are replaced by the IETF
   Chair, who is free to delegate the actual selection procedure to an
   Area Director.

2.7.  RFC3979: Intellectual Property Rights in IETF Technology

   Original text:


   (C) Where Intellectual Property Rights have been disclosed for IETF
       Documents as provided in Section 6 of this document, the IETF
       Executive Director shall request from the discloser of such IPR,
       a written assurance... The working group proposing the use of the technology
       with respect to which the Intellectual Property Rights are
       disclosed may assist the IETF Executive Director in this effort.
       ...  The results will, however,
       be recorded by the IETF Executive Director,...
   ...
6.4.2.  If a disclosure was made on the basis of a patent application
   (either published or unpublished), then, if requested to do so by the
   IESG or by a working group chair, the IETF Executive Director can
   request a new disclosure


   All four occurrences of "Executive Director" are replaced by "Head of
   Secretariat."


3.  Security Considerations
