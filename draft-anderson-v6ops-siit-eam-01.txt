                    draft-anderson-v6ops-siit-eam-01

Abstract

   This document extends the Stateless IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm
   (SIIT) with an Explicit Address Mapping algorithm.  This algorithm
   facilitates stateless IP/ICMP translation between arbitrary (non-
   IPv4-translatable) IPv6 endpoints and IPv4.

1.  Introduction

   The Stateless IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm (SIIT) [RFC6145]
   specifies that when translating IPv4 addresses to IPv6 and vice
   versa, all addresses must be translated using the algorithm specified
   in [RFC6052].  This document specifies an alternative to the
   [RFC6052] algorithm, where IP addresses are translated according to a
   table of Explicit Address Mappings configured on the stateless
   translator.  This removes the previous constraint that IPv6 nodes
   that communicate with IPv4 nodes through SIIT must be configured with
   IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses.

   The Explicit Address Mapping Table does not replace [RFC6052].  For
   most use cases, it is expected that both algorithms are used in
   concert.  The Explicit Address Mapping algorithm is used only when a
   mapping matching the address to be translated exists.  If no matching
   mapping exists, the [RFC6052] algorithm will be used instead.  Thus,
   when translating an individual IP packet, an SIIT implementation
   might translate one of the two IP address fields according to an EAM,
   while the other IP address field is translated according to
   [RFC6052].

1.1.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   EAM
      An Explicit Address Mapping, as specified in Section 3.

Internet-Draft                  SIIT-EAM                   December 2014


   EAMT
      The Explicit Address Mapping Table, as specified in Section 3.

   SIIT
      The Stateless IP/ICMP Translation algorithm, as specified in
      [RFC6145].

   IPv4-converted IPv6 addresses
      As defined in Section 1.3 of [RFC6052].

   IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses
      As defined in Section 1.3 of [RFC6052].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Problem Statement

   Section 3.2.1 of [RFC6144] notes that "stateless translation
   mechanisms typically put constraints on what IPv6 addresses can be
   assigned to IPv6 nodes that want to communicate with IPv4
   destinations using an algorithmic mapping".  In practice, this means
   that the IPv6 nodes must be configured with IPv4-translatable IPv6
   addresses.  For the reasons discussed below, some environments may
   find that the use of IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses is not desired
   or even possible.

   Limited availability:
      The number of IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses available to an
      operator is equal to the number of IPv4 addresses he assigns to
      the SIIT function.  IPv4 addresses are scarce, and as a result an
      operator might not have enough IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses to
      number his entire IPv6 infrastructure.

   Restricted format:
      IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses must conform to the format
      specified in Section 2.2 of [RFC6052].  This format is not
      compatible with other common IPv6 address formats, such as the
      EUI-64 based IPv6 address format used by IPv6 Stateless Address
      Autoconfiguration [RFC4862].

   An operator could overcome the above two problems by building an IPv6
   network using regular (non-IPv4-translatable) IPv6 addresses, and
   assign IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses as secondary addresses on the
   nodes that want to communicate with IPv4 nodes through SIIT only.
   However, doing so may result in a new set of undesired properties:

Internet-Draft                  SIIT-EAM                   December 2014


   Routing complexity:
      The IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses must be routed throughout the
      IPv6 network separately from the primary (non-IPv4-translatable)
      IPv6 addresses used by the nodes.  It might be impossible to
      aggregate these routes, as two adjacent IPv4-translatable IPv6
      addresses might not be assigned to two adjacent IPv6 nodes.  As a
      result, in order to support SIIT, the IPv6 network might need to
      carry a large number of extraneous routes.  These routes must be
      separately injected into the IPv6 routing topology somehow.  Any
      intermediate devices in the IPv6 network such as a firewall might
      require special configuration in order to treat the
      IPv4-translatable IPv6 address the same as the primary IPv6
      address, for example by requiring that any ACL entries involving
      the primary IPv6 address of a node must be duplicated.

   Operational complexity:
      The IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses must not only be assigned to
      the IPv6 nodes participating in SIIT; all applications and
      services on those nodes must also be configured to use them.  For
      example, if the IPv6 node is a load balancer, it might require a
      separate Virtual Server definition using the IPv4-translatable
      IPv6 address in addition to one using the service's primary IPv6
      address.  A web server might require specific configuration to
      listen for connections on both the IPv4-translatable and the
      primary IPv6 address.  A High-Availability cluster service must be
      set up to fail over both addresses between cluster nodes, and
      depending on how the IPv6 network learns the location of the
      IPv4-translatable IPv6 address, the fail-over mechanism used for
      the two addresses might be completely different.  Service
      monitoring must be done for both the IPv4-translatable and the
      primary IPv6 address, and any trouble-shooting procedures must be
      extended to involve both addresses.

   In short, the use of IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses in parallel
   with regular IPv6 addresses is in many ways analogous to the use of
   Dual Stack [RFC4213].  While no actual IPv4 packets are used, the
   IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses creates a secondary "stack" in the
   infrastructure that must be treated and operated separately from the
   primary one.  This increases the complexity of the overall
   infrastructure, in turn increasing operational overhead, and reducing
   reliability.  An operator who for such reasons finds the use Dual
   Stack unappealing, might feel the same way about using SIIT with
   IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses.

3.1.  Explicit Address Mapping Table

   An SIIT implementation MUST include an Explicit Address Mapping Table
   (EAMT).  By default, the EAMT SHOULD be empty.  The operator MUST be
   able to populate the EAMT using the implementation's normal
   configuration interfaces.  The implementation MAY additionally
   support other ways of populating the EAMT.

   The EAMT consists of the following columns:

      IPv4 Prefix

      IPv6 Prefix

   SIIT implementations MAY include other columns in order to support
   proprietary extensions to the EAM algorithm.

   Throughout this document, figures representing the EAMT contain an
   Index column using the pound sign as the header.  This column is not
   a required part of this specification; it is included only as a
   convenience to the reader.

3.2.  Explicit Address Mapping Specification

   An EAM consists of an IPv4 Prefix and an IPv6 Prefix.  The prefix
   length MAY be omitted, in which case the implementation MUST assume
   it to be 32 for IPv4 and 128 for IPv6.

                  Example Explicit Address Mapping Table

                  +---+--------------+-----------------+
                  | # | IPv4 Prefix  |   IPv6 Prefix   |
                  +---+--------------+-----------------+
                  | 1 | 192.0.2.1    | 2001:db8::      |
                  | 2 | 192.0.2.2/32 | 2001:db8::2/128 |
                  | 3 | 192.0.2.3    | 2001:db8::3     |
                  | 4 | 192.0.2.4/30 | 2001:db8::8/126 |
                  +---+--------------+-----------------+

                                 Figure 1

   When translating a packet between IPv4 and IPv6, an SIIT
   implementation MUST individually translate each IP address it
   encounters in the packet's IP headers (including any IP headers
   contained within ICMP errors) as follows:

   o  When translating an IPv4 address to IPv6, the SIIT implementation
      MUST first look up a matching prefix for the IPv4 address to be

      translated in the IPv4 Prefix column of the EAMT.  If a matching
      EAM entry is found, the address MUST be translated to IPv6 by
      substituting its IPv4 Prefix value for the corresponding IPv6
      Prefix from the EAM entry.

   o  When translating an IPv6 address to IPv4, the SIIT implementation
      MUST first look up a matching prefix for the IPv6 address to be
      translated in the IPv6 Prefix column of the EAMT.  If a matching
      EAM entry is found, the address MUST be translated to IPv4 by
      substituting its IPv6 Prefix value for the corresponding IPv4
      Prefix from the EAM entry.

   o  If no matching EAM is found, the SIIT implementation MUST proceed
      to translate the address in accordance with [RFC6145] (and its
      updates).

   An EAM's IPv4 Prefix and IPv6 Prefix MUST have identical suffix
   lengths.  Any suffix bits MUST be kept intact during translation.

   Overlapping EAMs SHOULD be considered an error, and attempts to
   insert them into the EAMT SHOULD be blocked.  The behaviour of an
   SIIT implementation when overlapping EAMs are present in the EAMT is
   left undefined.

4.  Lack of Checksum Neutrality

   When one or both of the address fields in an IP/ICMP packet are
   translated according to EAM, the translation can not be relied upon
   to be checksum neutral, even if the well-known prefix 64:ff9b::/96 is
   used.  This consideration is discussed in more detail in Section 4.1
   of [RFC6052].

5.  Security Considerations

   The EAM algorithm does not introduce any new security issues beyond
   those that are already discussed in Section 7 of [RFC6145].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This draft makes no request of the IANA.  The RFC Editor may remove
   this section prior to publication.

Appendix A.  Use Cases

   The following subsections lists some use cases that leverage SIIT
   with the EAM algorithm at the time of writing.

A.1.  464XLAT




Anderson                  Expires June 07, 2015                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                  SIIT-EAM                   December 2014


   When the CLAT component in the 464XLAT [RFC6877] architecture does
   not have a dedicated IPv6 prefix assigned, it may instead use "one
   interface IPv6 address that is claimed by the CLAT".  This IPv6
   address might not be IPv4-translatable.  If this is the case, the
   CLAT essentially implements the EAM algorithm using an EAMT as
   follows (assuming the CLAT's IPv4 address is picked from the IPv4
   Service Continuity Prefix [RFC7335]):

                     Example EAMT for an 464XLAT CLAT

           +---+--------------+-------------------------------+
           | # | IPv4 Prefix  |          IPv6 Prefix          |
           +---+--------------+-------------------------------+
           | 1 | 192.0.0.1/32 | CLAT_claimed_IPv6_address/128 |
           +---+--------------+-------------------------------+

                                 Figure 2

   In this particular use case, the EAM algorithm is used to translate
   IPv6 destination addresses to IPv4, and conversively, IPv4 source
   addresses to IPv6.  Other addresses are translated using [RFC6052].
   Note that this is the exact opposite of the SIIT-DC use case
   (Appendix A.2).

A.2.  SIIT-DC

   SIIT-DC [I-D.anderson-v6ops-siit-dc] describes the use of SIIT to
   facilitate connectivity from the IPv4 Internet to services hosted in
   an IPv6-only data centre.  In order to avoid the constraints relating
   to the use of IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses discussed in Section 2
   the stateless IPv4/IPv6 translators are provisioned with an EAMT
   containing one entry per IPv6-only service that are to be made
   available from the IPv4 Internet, for example (assuming
   2001:db8:aaaa::1 and 2001:db8:bbbb::1 are assigned to load balancers
   or servers that provides the IPv6-only services in question):

                         Example EAMT for SIIT-DC

                +---+--------------+----------------------+
                | # | IPv4 Prefix  |     IPv6 Prefix      |
                +---+--------------+----------------------+
                | 1 | 192.0.2.1/32 | 2001:db8:aaaa::1/128 |
                | 2 | 192.0.2.2/32 | 2001:db8:bbbb::1/128 |
