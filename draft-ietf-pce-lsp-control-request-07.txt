  Ability for a Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) to request and
             obtain control of a Label Switched Path (LSP)
                 draft-ietf-pce-lsp-control-request-07

Abstract

   A Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) retains information about
   the placement of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic
   Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs).  When a PCE has stateful
   control over LSPs it may send indications to LSP head-ends to modify
   the attributes (especially the paths) of the LSPs.  A Path
   Computation Client (PCC) has set up LSPs under local configuration
   may delegate control of those LSPs to a stateful PCE.

   There are use-cases in which a stateful PCE may wish to obtain
   control of locally configured LSPs of which it is aware but that have
   not been delegated to the PCE.

   This document describes an extension to the Path Computation Element
   communication Protocol (PCEP) to enable a PCE to make such requests.

1.  Introduction

   Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) communication Protocol (PCEP)
   extensions [RFC8231] specifies a set of extensions to PCEP [RFC5440]
   to enable stateful control of Traffic Engineering Label Switched
   Paths (TE LSPs) between and across PCEP sessions in compliance with
   [RFC4657].  It includes mechanisms to effect LSP state

Internet-Draft             LSP Control Request                 July 2019


   synchronization between Path Computation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs,
   delegation of control of LSPs to PCE, and PCE control of timing and
   sequence of path computations within and across PCEP sessions.  The
   stateful PCEP defines the following two useful network operations:

   o  Delegation: As per [RFC8051], an operation to grant a PCE
      temporary rights to modify a subset of LSP parameters on one or
      more LSPs of a PCC.  LSPs are delegated from a PCC to a PCE and
      are referred to as "delegated" LSPs.

   o  Revocation: As per [RFC8231], an operation performed by a PCC on a
      previously delegated LSP.  Revocation revokes the rights granted
      to the PCE in the delegation operation.

   For Redundant Stateful PCEs (section 5.7.4. of [RFC8231]), during a
   PCE failure, one of the redundant PCE could request to take control
   over an LSP.  The redundant PCEs may use a local policy or a
   proprietary election mechanism to decide which PCE would take
   control.  In this case, a mechanism is needed for a stateful PCE to
   request control of one or more LSPs from a PCC, so that a newly
   elected primary PCE can request to take over control.

   In case of virtualized PCEs (vPCE) running as virtual network
   function (VNF), as the computation load in the network increases, a
   new instance of vPCE could be instantiated to balance the current
   load.  The PCEs could use proprietary algorithm to decide which LSPs
   to be assigned to the new vPCE.  Thus having a mechanism for the PCE
   to request control of some LSPs is needed.

   In some deployments, the operator would like to use stateful PCE for
   global optimization algorithms but would still like to keep the
   control of the LSP at the PCC.  In such cases, a stateful PCE could
   request to take control during the global optimization and return the
   delegation once done.

   Note that [RFC8231] specify a mechanism for a PCC to delegate an
   orphaned LSP to another PCE.  The mechanism defined in this document
   can be used in conjunction to [RFC8231].  Ultimately, it is the PCC
   that decides which PCE to delegate the orphaned LSP.

   This specification provides a simple extension, by using this a PCE
   can request control of one or more LSPs from any PCC over the
   stateful PCEP session.  The procedures for granting and relinquishing
   control of the LSPs are specified in accordance with the
   specification [RFC8231].

Internet-Draft             LSP Control Request                 July 2019


2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC5440]:

     PCC:  Path Computation Client.

     PCE:  Path Computation Element.

     PCEP:  Path Computation Element communication Protocol.

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC8231]:

     PCRpt:  Path Computation State Report message.

     PCUpd:  Path Computation Update Request message.

     PLSP-ID:  A PCEP-specific identifier for the LSP.

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  LSP Control Request Flag

   The Stateful PCE Request Parameters (SRP) object is defined in
   [RFC8231], it includes a Flags field.

   A new flag, the "LSP-Control Request Flag" (C), is introduced in the
   SRP object.  On a PCUpd message, a PCE sets the C Flag to 1 to
   indicate that, it wishes to gain control of LSPs.  The LSPs are
   identified by the LSP object.  A PLSP-ID of value other than 0 and
   0xFFFFF is used to identify the LSP for which the PCE requests
   control.  The PLSP-ID value of 0 indicates that the PCE is requesting
   control of all LSPs originating from the PCC that it wishes to
   delegate.  The C Flag has no meaning in the PCRpt and PCInitiate
   message and MUST be set to 0 on transmission and MUST be ignored on
   receipt.

4.  Operation

   During normal operation, a PCC that wishes to delegate the control of
   an LSP sets the D Flag (delegate) to 1 in all PCRpt messages
   pertaining to the LSP.  The PCE confirms the delegation by setting D
   Flag to 1 in all PCUpd messages pertaining to the LSP.  The PCC

Internet-Draft             LSP Control Request                 July 2019


   revokes the control of the LSP from the PCE by setting D Flag to 0 in
   PCRpt messages pertaining to the LSP.  If the PCE wishes to
   relinquish the control of the LSP, it sets D Flag to 0 in all PCUpd
   messages pertaining to the LSP.

   If a PCE wishes to gain control over an LSP, it sends a PCUpd message
   with C Flag set to 1 in SRP object.  The LSP for which the PCE
   requests control is identified by the PLSP-ID.  The PLSP-ID of 0
   indicates that the PCE wants control over all LSPs originating from
   the PCC.  A PCC that receives a PCUpd message with C Flag set to 1
   and PLSP-ID of 0 MUST NOT trigger the error condition for unknown
   PLSP-ID in an LSP update request as per [RFC8231].  The D Flag and C
   Flag are mutually exclusive in PCUpd message.  The PCE SHOULD NOT
   send control request for LSP which is already delegated to the PCE,
   i.e. if the D Flag is set in the PCUpd message, then C Flag SHOULD
   NOT be set.  If a PCC receives a PCUpd message with D Flag set in the
   LSP object (i.e.  LSP is already delegated) and the C Flag is also
   set (i.e.  PCE is making a control request), the PCC MUST ignore the
   C Flag.  A PCC can decide to delegate the control of the LSP at its
   own discretion.  If the PCC grants or denies the control, it sends
   PCRpt message with D Flag set to 1 and 0 respectively in accordance
   with stateful PCEP [RFC8231].  If the PCC does not grant the control,
   it MAY choose to not respond, and the PCE MAY choose to retry
   requesting the control preferably using exponentially increasing
   timer.  A PCE ignores the C Flag on the PCRpt message.  Note that,
   the PCUpd message with C Flag set is received for a currently non-
   delegated LSP (for which the PCE is requesting delegation), this MUST
   NOT trigger the error handling as specified in [RFC8231] (a PCErr
   with Error-type=19 (Invalid Operation) and error-value 1 (Attempted
   LSP Update Request for a non-delegated LSP)).

   As per [RFC8231], a PCC cannot delegate an LSP to more than one PCE
   at any time.  If a PCE requests control of an LSP that has already
   been delegated by the PCC to another PCE, the PCC MAY ignore the
   request, or MAY revoke the delegation to the first PCE before
   delegating it to the second.  This choice is a matter of local
   policy.

   It should be noted that a legacy implementation of PCC, that does not
   support this extension would trigger the error condition as specified
   in [RFC8231] (a PCErr with Error-type=19 (Invalid Operation) and
   error-value 1 (Attempted LSP Update Request for a non-delegated LSP))
   as the D Flag would be unset in this update request.  Further, in
   case of PLSP-ID of 0, the error condition as specified in [RFC8231]
   (a PCErr with Error-type=19 (Invalid Operation) and error-value 3
   (Attempted LSP Update Request for an LSP identified by an unknown
   PSP-ID)) would be triggered.

Internet-Draft             LSP Control Request                 July 2019


   [RFC8281] describes the setup, maintenance and teardown of PCE-
   initiated LSPs under the stateful PCE model.  It also specify how a
   PCE MAY obtain control over an orphaned LSP that was PCE-initiated.
   A PCE implementation can apply the mechanism described in this
   document in conjunction with those in [RFC8281].

5.  Implementation Status

   [Note to the RFC Editor - remove this section before publication, as
   well as remove the reference to RFC 7942.]

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

5.1.  Huawei's Proof of Concept based on ONOS

   The PCE function was developed in the ONOS open source platform.
   This extension was implemented on a private version as a proof of
   concept to enable multi-instance support.

   o  Organization: Huawei

   o  Implementation: Huawei's PoC based on ONOS

   o  Description: PCEP as a southbound plugin was added to ONOS.  To
      support multi-instance ONOS deployment in a cluster, this
      extension in PCEP is used.  Refer
      https://wiki.onosproject.org/display/ONOS/PCEP+Protocol

   o  Maturity Level: Prototype

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations listed in [RFC8231] and [RFC8281] apply
   to this document as well.  However, this document also introduces a
   new attack vector.  An attacker may flood the PCC with request to
   delegate all its LSPs at a rate which exceeds the PCC's ability to
   process them, either by spoofing messages or by compromising the PCE
   itself.  The PCC SHOULD be configured with a threshold rate for the
   delegation requests received from the PCE.  If threshold is reached,
   it is RECOMMENDED to log the issue.

   As per [RFC8231], it is RECOMMENDED that these PCEP extensions only
   be activated on authenticated and encrypted sessions across PCEs and
   PCCs belonging to the same administrative authority, using Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) [RFC8253], as per the recommendations and best
   current practices in [RFC7525] (unless explicitly set aside in
   [RFC8253]).

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  SRP Object Flags

   IANA maintains a registry called the "Path Computation Element
   Protocol (PCEP) Numbers" registry.  It contains a subregistry called
   the "SRP Object Flag Field" registry.  This document requests IANA to
   allocate following code point in the "SRP Object Flag Field"
   subregistry.

            Bit            Description           Reference
            TBD            LSP-Control           This document

8.  Manageability Considerations

   All manageability requirements and considerations listed in [RFC5440]
   and [RFC8231] apply to PCEP protocol extensions defined in this
   document.  In addition, requirements and considerations listed in
   this section apply.

8.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   A PCC implementation SHOULD allow the operator to configure the
   policy based on which it honors the request to control the LSPs.
   This includes the handling of the case where an LSP control request
   is received for an LSP that is currently delegated to some other PCE.

Internet-Draft             LSP Control Request                 July 2019


   A PCC implementation SHOULD also allow the operator to configure the
   threshold rate based on which it accepts the delegation requests from
   the PCE.  Further, the operator MAY be allowed to trigger the LSP
   control request for a particular LSP at the PCE.  A PCE
   implementation SHOULD also allow the operator to configure an
   exponentially increasing timer to retry the control requests for
   which the PCE did not get a response.

8.2.  Information and Data Models

   The PCEP YANG module [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-yang] could be extended to
   include mechanism to trigger the LSP control request.

8.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new liveness
   detection and monitoring requirements in addition to those already
   listed in [RFC5440].

8.4.  Verify Correct Operations

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new operation
   verification requirements in addition to those already listed in
   [RFC5440] and [RFC8231].

8.5.  Requirements On Other Protocols

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new requirements
   on other protocols.

8.6.  Impact On Network Operations

   Mechanisms defined in [RFC5440] and [RFC8231] also apply to PCEP
   extensions defined in this document.  Further, the mechanism
   described in this document can help the operator to request control
   of the LSPs at a particular PCE.
