Abstract

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Resource Priority Header
   (RPH), in its current form, is ignored in SIP responses.  This was a
   design choice during RFC 4412's development. This is now considered 
   a bad design choice in certain scenarios.  This document corrects 
   RFC 4412's communications model by optionally allowing a SIP server 
   or user agent client to process the Resource-Priority Header in a 
   response.

1.  Introduction

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Resource Priority Header
   (RPH) [RFC4412], in its current form, is ignored by SIP entities if 
   in SIP responses.  It was a design choice during RFC 4412's 
   development that only stateful servers would grant SIP messages 
   preferential treatment. This is now considered a bad design choice 
   in certain scenarios, such as those entities within trusted 
   networks, and where stateless servers are surrounded by more 
   stateful servers.  This document corrects RFC 4412's communications 
   model by allowing a SIP server or user agent client to process the 
   Resource-Priority Header in a response.

   RFC 4412 defines the SIP Resource-Priority header, and is a 
   standards track extension to SIP [RFC3261].  Section 3.3 of RFC 4412
   has the following table 2 entry:

     Header field             where proxy INV ACK CAN BYE REG OPT PRA
     ----------------------------------------------------------------
     Resource-Priority        R     amdr   o   o   o   o   o   o   o

     Header field             where proxy SUB NOT UPD MSG REF INF PUB
     ----------------------------------------------------------------
     Resource-Priority        R     amdr   o   o   o   o   o   o   o

   According to RFC 3261, the 'R' in the "where" column states a 
   particular header is found in requests, and ignored in responses.  
   Table 2 is a quick reference of usage of a header, but alone, is 
   insufficient to define the expected behavior of a SIP header, 
   relying instead on what the header description text says in the RFC 
   that creates the header. RFC 4412 fails to provide clear normative 
   text indicating whether or not an RPH can be found in a response, or
   what a SIP element is to do with it once received.  

   The assumption at the time of RFC 4412 was that the 
   Resource-Priority header would only be used in managed IP networks 
   where all SIP servers were statefully aware of the RPH value within 
   a transaction from the request message, maintaining state of the 
   value for the response. 

   There is a need now to have stateless SIP servers have the 
   Resource-Priority header in responses in some environments.  

   This document IANA registers the Resource-Priority header for usage 
   in responses.

   This document updates RFC 4412.


2.  Adding Resource-Priority Header in SIP Responses


   The following the correction of the table 2 entry for the 
   Resource-Priority header:

     Header field             where proxy INV ACK CAN BYE REG OPT PRA
     ----------------------------------------------------------------
     Resource-Priority              amdr   o   o   o   o   o   o   o

     Header field             where proxy SUB NOT UPD MSG REF INF PUB
     ----------------------------------------------------------------
     Resource-Priority              amdr   o   o   o   o   o   o   o

   The difference is in the "where" column, in which the "R" was 
   removed.  The specific behaviors resulting from this are explained 
   in the next 3 sub-sections.

   The above is to replace what is currently stated by RFC 4412, and 
   what is IANA registered.


2.1 UAC Behavior

   The UAC MAY process SIP responses containing the Resource-Priority 
   header according to the local policy of the network or UAC.  If the 
   response header value is different than the original request value, 
   local policy SHOULD determine which to process the message based on,
   but will likely be at the same priority-value as was in the request
   the UAC send to the UAS.


2.2 UAS Behavior

   The UAS MAY include the Resource-Priority header in responses.  
   Typically the Resource-Priority header value will be the same in the
   response as it was in the request.  The UAS MAY change the 
   Resource-Priority header value, depending on local policy.  Reasons 
   for this are outside the scope of this document.


2.3 Proxy Behavior

   SIP Proxies MAY process the Resource-Priority header in responses; 
   meaning, in certain environments, the choice of whether or not to 
   process the RPH will not be in doubt.  This configuration choice 
   could be on a per transaction basis, on a per server basis, or under
   some other parameter choice, all based on local policy of the proxy.



Polk                  Expires December 13th, 2007              [Page 3]
Internet-Draft            SIP RPH in Responses                June 2007

   This Resource-Priority header value MAY be the same or different 
   between request and response, depending on local policy downstream 
   of this proxy.  SIP Proxies MAY add or modify the Resource-Priority 
   header value in responses with this update.  SIP Proxies MAY, but 
   SHOULD NOT delete Resource-Priority header value in responses, as a 
   Resource-Priority header value MAY have use other than at this 
   particular proxy.  Local policy will determine this configuration.

   SIP Proxies SHOULD be able to ignore the header by configuration, in
   such environments that have RPH enabled SIP entities that are 
   configured to remain aware of the RPH priority-value in a request 
   part of the transaction, or do not trust the possibility of a 
   priority mark up, from what was in the request message.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The following is replace what is registered in the sip-parameters 
   section of IANA for the Resource-Priority header:

     Header field             where proxy INV ACK CAN BYE REG OPT PRA
     ----------------------------------------------------------------
     Resource-Priority              amdr   o   o   o   o   o   o   o

     Header field             where proxy SUB NOT UPD MSG REF INF PUB
     ----------------------------------------------------------------
     Resource-Priority              amdr   o   o   o   o   o   o   o

   [Editor's NOTE: since this registration replaces an existing 
    registration, but does not offer supporting text for what was not 
    changed, does IANA give references to both this doc and RFC 4412 
    once this doc is RFC'd?]


5.  Security Considerations

   The Security considerations that apply to RFC 4412 [RFC4412] apply 
   here.  The only new security threat this document introduces 
   relative to RFC 4412 is in SIP entities that grant unconditional, 
   stateless, preferential treatment based on the RPH priority-value. 
   This is a configuration issue, and not a implementation issue, and 
   operators should avoided allowing the configuration of blind SIP 
   entities to process according to a priority marking without having a
   means of checking if the marking is valid.  Invalid marking could 
   grant inappropriate treatment to SIP messages that do not deserve
