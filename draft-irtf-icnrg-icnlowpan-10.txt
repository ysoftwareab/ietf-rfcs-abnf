Abstract

   This document defines a convergence layer for CCNx and NDN over IEEE
   802.15.4 LoWPAN networks.  A new frame format is specified to adapt
   CCNx and NDN packets to the small MTU size of IEEE 802.15.4.  For
   that, syntactic and semantic changes to the TLV-based header formats
   are described.  To support compatibility with other LoWPAN
   technologies that may coexist on a wireless medium, the dispatching
   scheme provided by 6LoWPAN is extended to include new dispatch types
   for CCNx and NDN.  Additionally, the fragmentation component of the
   6LoWPAN dispatching framework is applied to ICN chunks.  In its
   second part, the document defines stateless and stateful compression
   schemes to improve efficiency on constrained links.  Stateless
   compression reduces TLV expressions to static header fields for
   common use cases.  Stateful compression schemes elide state local to
   the LoWPAN and replace names in data packets by short local
   identifiers.

1.  Introduction

   The Internet of Things (IoT) has been identified as a promising
   deployment area for Information Centric Networks (ICN), as
   infrastructureless access to content, resilient forwarding, and in-
   network data replication demonstrated notable advantages over the
   traditional host-to-host approach on the Internet [NDN-EXP1],
   [NDN-EXP2].  Recent studies [NDN-MAC] have shown that an appropriate
   mapping to link layer technologies has a large impact on the
   practical performance of an ICN.  This will be even more relevant in
   the context of IoT communication where nodes often exchange messages
   via low-power wireless links under lossy conditions.  In this memo,
   we address the base adaptation of data chunks to such link layers for
   the ICN flavors NDN [NDN] and CCNx [RFC8569], [RFC8609].

   The IEEE 802.15.4 [ieee802.15.4] link layer is used in low-power and
   lossy networks (see "LLN" in [RFC7228]), in which devices are
   typically battery-operated and constrained in resources.
   Characteristics of LLNs include an unreliable environment, low

   bandwidth transmissions, and increased latencies.  IEEE 802.15.4
   admits a maximum physical layer packet size of 127 bytes.  The
   maximum frame header size is 25 bytes, which leaves 102 bytes for the
   payload.  IEEE 802.15.4 security features further reduce this payload
   length by up to 21 bytes, yielding a net of 81 bytes for CCNx or NDN
   packet headers, signatures and content.

   6LoWPAN [RFC4944], [RFC6282] is a convergence layer that provides
   frame formats, header compression and adaptation layer fragmentation
   for IPv6 packets in IEEE 802.15.4 networks.  The 6LoWPAN adaptation
   introduces a dispatching framework that prepends further information
   to 6LoWPAN packets, including a protocol identifier for payload and
   meta information about fragmentation.

   Prevalent Type-Length-Value (TLV) based packet formats such as in
   CCNx and NDN are designed to be generic and extensible.  This leads
   to header verbosity which is inappropriate in constrained
   environments of IEEE 802.15.4 links.  This document presents ICN
   LoWPAN, a convergence layer for IEEE 802.15.4 motivated by 6LoWPAN.
   ICN LoWPAN compresses packet headers of CCNx as well as NDN and
   allows for an increased effective payload size per packet.
   Additionally, reusing the dispatching framework defined by 6LoWPAN
   enables compatibility between coexisting wireless deployments of
   competing network technologies.  This also allows to reuse the
   adaptation layer fragmentation scheme specified by 6LoWPAN for ICN
   LoWPAN.

   ICN LoWPAN defines a more space efficient representation of CCNx and
   NDN packet formats.  This syntactic change is described for CCNx and
   NDN separately, as the header formats and TLV encodings differ
   notably.  For further reductions, default header values suitable for
   constrained IoT networks are selected in order to elide corresponding
   TLVs.  Experimental evaluations of the ICN LoWPAN header compression
   schemes in [ICNLOWPAN] illustrate a reduced message overhead, a
   shortened message airtime, and an overall decline in power
   consumption for typical Class 2 [RFC7228] devices compared to
   uncompressed ICN messages.

   In a typical IoT scenario (see (Figure 1)), embedded devices are
   interconnected via a quasi-stationary infrastructure using a border
   router (BR) that connects the constrained LoWPAN network by some
   Gateway with the public Internet.  In ICN based IoT networks, non-
   local Interest and Data messages transparently travel through the BR
   up and down between a Gateway and the embedded devices situated in
   the constrained LoWPAN.

3.  Overview of ICN LoWPAN

3.1.  Link-Layer Convergence

   ICN LoWPAN provides a convergence layer that maps ICN packets onto
   constrained link-layer technologies.  This includes features such as
   link-layer fragmentation, protocol separation on the link-layer
   level, and link-layer address mappings.  The stack traversal is
   visualized in Figure 2.

   Section 4 of this document defines the convergence layer for IEEE
   802.15.4.

3.2.  Stateless Header Compression

   ICN LoWPAN also defines a stateless header compression scheme with
   the main purpose of reducing header overhead of ICN packets.  This is
   of particular importance for link-layers with small MTUs.  The
   stateless compression does not require pre-configuration of global
   state.

   The CCNx and NDN header formats are composed of Type-Length-Value
   (TLV) fields to encode header data.  The advantage of TLVs is its
   native support of variably structured data.  The main disadvantage of
   TLVs is the verbosity that results from storing the type and length
   of the encoded data.

Internet-Draft          ICN Adaptation to LoWPANs          February 2021


   The stateless header compression scheme makes use of compact bit
   fields to indicate the presence of optional TLVs in the uncompressed
   packet.  The order of set bits in the bit fields corresponds to the
   order of each TLV in the packet.  Further compression is achieved by
   specifying default values and reducing the range of certain header
   fields.

   Figure 3 demonstrates the stateless header compression idea.  In this
   example, the first type of the first TLV is removed and the
   corresponding bit in the bit field is set.  The second TLV represents
   a fixed-length TLV (e.g., the Nonce TLV in NDN), so that the type and
   the length fields are removed.  The third TLV represents a boolean
   TLV (e.g., the MustBeFresh selector in NDN) for which the type,
   length and the value fields are elided.

                            inclusion of TLVs.

   Stateless TLV compression for NDN is defined in Section 5.  Section 6
   defines the stateless TLV compression for CCNx.

   The extensibility of this compression is described in Section 4.1.1
   and allows future documents to update the compression rules outlined
   in this manuscript.

3.3.  Stateful Header Compression

   ICN LoWPAN further employs two orthogonal stateful compression
   schemes for packet size reductions which are defined in Section 8.
   These mechanisms rely on shared contexts that are either distributed
   and maintained in the entire LoWPAN, or are generated on-demand hop-
   wise on a particular Interest-data path.

   The shared context identification is defined in Section 8.1.  The
   hop-wise name compression "en-route" is specified in Section 8.2.

4.  IEEE 802.15.4 Adaptation

4.1.  LoWPAN Encapsulation

   The IEEE 802.15.4 frame header does not provide a protocol identifier
   for its payload.  This causes problems of misinterpreting frames when
   several network layers coexist on the same link.  To mitigate errors,
   6LoWPAN defines dispatches as encapsulation headers for IEEE 802.15.4
   frames (see Section 5 of [RFC4944]).  Multiple LoWPAN encapsulation
   headers can precede the actual payload and each encapsulation header
   is identified by a dispatch type.

   [RFC8025] further specifies dispatch pages to switch between
   different contexts.  When a LoWPAN parser encounters a "Page switch"
   LoWPAN encapsulation header, then all following encapsulation headers
   are interpreted by using a dispatch table as specified by the "Page
   switch" header.  Page 0 and page 1 are reserved for 6LoWPAN.  This
   document uses page TBD1 ("1111 TBD1 (0xFTBD1)") for ICN LoWPAN.

   The base dispatch format (Figure 4) is used and extended by CCNx and
   NDN in Section 5 and Section 6.

   Extension bytes allow for the extensibility of the initial
   compression rule set.  The base format for an extension byte is

   Extension bytes are numbered according to their order.  Future
   documents MUST follow the naming scheme "EXT_0, EXT_1, ...", when
   updating or referring to a specific dispatch extension byte.
   Amendments that require an exchange of configurational parameters
   between devices SHOULD use manifests to encode structured data in a
   well-defined format, as, e.g., outlined in [I-D.irtf-icnrg-flic].

4.2.  Adaptation Layer Fragmentation

   Small payload sizes in the LoWPAN require fragmentation for various
   network layers.  Therefore, Section 5.3 of [RFC4944] defines a
   protocol-independent fragmentation dispatch type, a fragmentation
   header for the first fragment, and a separate fragmentation header
   for subsequent fragments.  ICN LoWPAN adopts this fragmentation
   handling of [RFC4944].

   The Fragmentation LoWPAN header can encapsulate other dispatch
   headers.  The order of dispatch types is defined in Section 5 of
   [RFC4944].  Figure 8 shows the fragmentation scheme.  The reassembled
   ICN LoWPAN frame does not contain any fragmentation headers and is
   depicted in Figure 9.

                  Figure 9: Reassembled ICN LoWPAN frame

   The 6LoWPAN Fragment Forwarding (6FF) [RFC8930] is an alternative
   approach that enables forwarding of fragments without reassembling
   packets on every intermediate hop.  By reusing the 6LoWPAN
   dispatching framework, 6FF integrates into ICN LoWPAN as seamless as
   the conventional hop-wise fragmentation.  Experimental evaluations
   [SFR-ICNLOWPAN], however, suggest that a more refined integration can
   increase the cache utilization of forwarders on a request path.

5.  Space-efficient Message Encoding for NDN

5.1.  TLV Encoding

   The NDN packet format consists of TLV fields using the TLV encoding
   that is described in [NDN-PACKET-SPEC].  Type and length fields are
   of variable size, where numbers greater than 252 are encoded using
   multiple bytes.

   If the type or length number is less than "253", then that number is
   encoded into the actual type or length field.  If the number is
   greater or equals "253" and fits into 2 bytes, then the type or
   length field is set to "253" and the number is encoded in the next
   following 2 bytes in network byte order, i.e., from the most
   significant byte (MSB) to the least significant byte (LSB).  If the
   number is greater than 2 bytes and fits into 4 bytes, then the type



Gundogan, et al.         Expires August 14, 2021               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft          ICN Adaptation to LoWPANs          February 2021


   or length field is set to "254" and the number is encoded in the
   subsequent 4 bytes in network byte order.  For larger numbers, the
   type or length field is set to "255" and the number is encoded in the
   subsequent 8 bytes in network byte order.

   In this specification, compressed NDN TLVs encode type and length
   fields using self-delimiting numeric values (SDNVs) [RFC6256]
   commonly known from DTN protocols.  Instead of using the first byte
   as a marker for the number of following bytes, SDNVs use a single bit
   to indicate subsequent bytes.

               Table 1: NDN TLV encoding compared to SDNVs.

   Table 1 compares the required bytes for encoding a few selected
   values using the NDN TLV encoding and SDNVs.  For values up to 127,
   both methods require a single byte.  Values in the range [128;252]
   encode as one byte for the NDN TLV scheme, while SDNVs require two
   bytes.  Starting at value 253, SDNVs require a less or equal amount
   of bytes compared to the NDN TLV encoding.

5.2.  Name TLV Compression

   This Name TLV compression encodes length fields of two consecutive
   NameComponent TLVs into one byte, using a nibble for each.  The most
   significant nibble indicates the length of an immediately following
   NameComponent TLV.  The least significant nibble denotes the length

Internet-Draft          ICN Adaptation to LoWPANs          February 2021


   of a subsequent NameComponent TLV.  A length of 0 marks the end of
   the compressed Name TLV.  The last length field of an encoded
   NameComponent is either 0x00 for a name with an even number of
   components, and 0xYF (Y > 0) if an odd number of components are
   present.  This process limits the length of a NameComponent TLV to 15
   bytes, but allows for an unlimited number of components.  An example
   for this encoding is presented in Figure 10.

5.3.  Interest Messages

5.3.1.  Uncompressed Interest Messages

   An uncompressed Interest message uses the base dispatch format (see
   Figure 4) and sets the C flag to "0" and the P as well as the M flag
   to "0" (Figure 11).  The Interest message is handed to the NDN
   network stack without modifications.

5.3.2.  Compressed Interest Messages

   The compressed Interest message uses the extended dispatch format
   (Figure 5) and sets the C flag to "1", the P flag to "0" and the M
   flag to "0".  If an Interest message contains TLVs that are not

   mentioned in the following compression rules, then this message MUST
   be sent uncompressed.

   This specification assumes that a HopLimit TLV is part of the
   original Interest message.  If such HopLimit TLV is not present, it
   will be inserted with a default value of DEFAULT_NDN_HOPLIMIT prior
   to the compression.

   In the default use case, the Interest message is compressed with the
   following minimal rule set:

   1.  The "Type" field of the outermost MessageType TLV is removed.

   2.  The Name TLV is compressed according to Section 5.2.  For this,
       all NameComponents are expected to be of type
       GenericNameComponent with a length greater than 0.  An
       ImplicitSha256DigestComponent or ParametersSha256DigestComponent
       MAY appear at the end of the name.  In any other case, the
       message MUST be sent uncompressed.

   3.  The Nonce TLV and InterestLifetime TLV are moved to the end of
       the compressed Interest as illustrated in Figure 12.  The
       InterestLifetime is encoded as described in Section 7.  On
       decompression, this encoding may yield an Interestlifetime that
       is smaller than the original value.

   4.  The Type and Length fields of Nonce TLV, HopLimit TLV and
       InterestLifetime TLV are elided.  The Nonce value has a length of
       4 bytes and the HopLimit value has a length of 1 byte.  The
       compressed InterestLifetime (Section 7) has a length of 1 byte.
       The presence of a Nonce and InterestLifetime TLV is deduced from
       the remaining length to parse.  A remaining length of "1"
       indicates the presence of an InerestLifetime, a length of "4"
       indicates the presence of a nonce, and a length of "5" indicates
       the presence of both TLVs.

   The compressed NDN LoWPAN Interest message is visualized in
   Figure 12.

5.4.  Data Messages

5.4.1.  Uncompressed Data Messages

   An uncompressed Data message uses the base dispatch format and sets
   the C flag to "0", the P flag to "0" and the M flag to "1"
   (Figure 15).  The Data message is handed to the NDN network stack
   without modifications.

5.4.2.  Compressed Data Messages

   The compressed Data message uses the extended dispatch format
   (Figure 5) and sets the C as well as the M flags to "1".  The P flag
   is set to "0".  If a Data message contains TLVs that are not
   mentioned in the following compression rules, then this message MUST
   be sent uncompressed.

   By default, the Data message is compressed with the following base
   rule set:

   1.  The "Type" field of the outermost MessageType TLV is removed.

   2.  The Name TLV is compressed according to Section 5.2.  For this,
       all NameComponents are expected to be of type
       GenericNameComponent and to have a length greater than 0.  In any
       other case, the message MUST be sent uncompressed.

   3.  The MetaInfo TLV Type and Length fields are elided from the
       compressed Data message.

   4.  The FreshnessPeriod TLV MUST be moved to the end of the
       compressed Data message.  Type and Length fields are elided and
       the value is encoded as described in Section 7 as a 1-byte time-
       code.  If the freshness period is not a valid time-value, then
       the message MUST be sent uncompressed in order to preserve the
       security envelope of the Data message.  The presence of a
       FreshnessPeriod TLV is deduced from the remaining one byte length
       to parse.

   5.  The Type fields of the SignatureInfo TLV, SignatureType TLV and
       SignatureValue TLV are removed.

   The compressed NDN LoWPAN Data message is visualized in Figure 16.

                   and it is encoded according to Section 5.2.  If the
                   FinalBlockId TLV is not compressible, then the
                   message MUST be sent uncompressed.

   CON: ContentType TLV

                   TLV.  The Type field is removed from the compressed
                   message.

   KLO: KeyLocator TLV

       0:          If the included SignatureType requires a KeyLocator
                   TLV, then the KeyLocator represents a name and is
                   compressed according to Section 5.2.  If the name is
                   not compressible, then the message MUST be sent
                   uncompressed.

       1:          If the included SignatureType requires a KeyLocator
                   TLV, then the KeyLocator represents a KeyDigest.  The

6.  Space-efficient Message Encoding for CCNx

6.1.  TLV Encoding

   The generic CCNx TLV encoding is described in [RFC8609].  Type and
   Length fields attain the common fixed length of 2 bytes.

   The TLV encoding for CCNx LoWPAN is changed to the more space
   efficient encoding described in Section 5.1.  Hence NDN and CCNx use
   the same compressed format for writing TLVs.

6.2.  Name TLV Compression

   Name TLVs are compressed using the scheme already defined in
   Section 5.2 for NDN.  If a Name TLV contains T_IPID, T_APP, or
   organizational TLVs, then the name remains uncompressed.

6.3.  Interest Messages

6.3.1.  Uncompressed Interest Messages

   An uncompressed Interest message uses the base dispatch format (see
   Figure 4) and sets the C as well as the M flag to "0".  The P flag is
   set to "1" (Figure 19).  The Interest message is handed to the CCNx
   network stack without modifications.

6.3.2.  Compressed Interest Messages

   The compressed Interest message uses the extended dispatch format
   (Figure 5) and sets the C and P flags to "1".  The M flag is set to
   "0".  If an Interest message contains TLVs that are not mentioned in
   the following compression rules, then this message MUST be sent
   uncompressed.

   In the default use case, the Interest message is compressed with the
   following minimal rule set:

   1.  The Type and Length fields of the CCNx Message TLV are elided and
       are obtained from the Fixed Header on decompression.

   The compressed CCNx LoWPAN Interest message is visualized in
   Figure 20.

6.3.2.1.  Hop-By-Hop Header TLVs Compression

   Hop-By-Hop Header TLVs are unordered.  For an Interest message, two
   optional Hop-By-Hop Header TLVs are defined in [RFC8609], but several
   more can be defined in higher level specifications.  For the
   compression specified in the previous section, the Hop-By-Hop TLVs
   are ordered as follows:

   1.  Interest Lifetime TLV

   2.  Message Hash TLV

   Note: Other Hop-By-Hop Header TLVs than those two remain uncompressed

6.4.2.  Compressed Content Objects

   The compressed Content object uses the extended dispatch format
   (Figure 5) and sets the C, P, as well as the M flag to "1".  If a
   Content object contains TLVs that are not mentioned in the following
   compression rules, then this message MUST be sent uncompressed.

   By default, the Content object is compressed with the following base
   rule set:

   1.  The PacketType field is elided from the Fixed Header.

   2.  The Type and Length fields of the CCNx Message TLV are elided and
       are obtained from the Fixed Header on decompression.

   The compressed CCNx LoWPAN Data message is visualized in Figure 25.

   Hop-By-Hop Header TLVs are unordered.  For a Content Object message,
   two optional Hop-By-Hop Header TLVs are defined in [RFC8609], but
   several more can be defined in higher level specifications.  For the
   compression specified in the previous section, the Hop-By-Hop TLVs
   are ordered as follows:

   1.  Recommended Cache Time TLV

   2.  Message Hash TLV

   Note: Other Hop-By-Hop Header TLVs than those two remain uncompressed
   in the encoded message and they appear in the same order as in the
   original message, but after the Recommended Cache Time TLV and
   Message Hash TLV.

7.  Compressed Time Encoding

   This document adopts the 8-bit compact time representation for
   relative time values described in Section 5 of [RFC5497] with the
   constant factor "C" set to "C := 1/32".

   Valid time offsets in CCNx and NDN reach from a few milliseconds
   (e.g., lifetime of low-latency Interests) to several years (e.g.,
   content freshness periods in caches).  Therefore, this document adds
   two modifications to the compression algorithm.

   The first modification is the inclusion of a subnormal form
   [IEEE.754.2019] for time-codes with exponent 0 to provide an
   increased precision and a gradual underflow for the smallest numbers.
   The formula is changed as follows (a := mantissa; b := exponent):

   Subnormal (b == 0):  (0 + a/8) * 2 * C

   Normalized (b > 0):  (1 + a/8) * 2^b * C (see [RFC5497])

   This configuration allows for the following ranges:

   o  Minimum subnormal number: 0 seconds

   o  2nd minimum subnormal number: ~0.007812 seconds

   o  Maximum subnormal number: ~0.054688 seconds

   o  Minimum normalized number: ~0.062500 seconds

   o  2nd minimum normalized number: ~0.070312 seconds

Internet-Draft          ICN Adaptation to LoWPANs          February 2021


   o  Maximum normalized number: ~3.99 years

   The second modification only applies to uncompressible time offsets
   that are outside any security envelope.  An invalid time-value MUST
   be set to the largest valid time-value that is smaller than the
   invalid input value before compression.

8.  Stateful Header Compression

   Stateful header compression in ICN LoWPAN enables packet size
   reductions in two ways.  First, common information that is shared
   throughout the local LoWPAN may be memorized in context state at all
   nodes and omitted from communication.  Second, redundancy in a single
   Interest-data exchange may be removed from ICN stateful forwarding on
   a hop-by-hop bases and memorized in en-route state tables.

8.1.  LoWPAN-local State

   A context identifier (CID) is a byte that refers to a particular
   conceptual context between network devices and MAY be used to replace
   frequently appearing information, such as name prefixes, suffixes, or
   meta information, such as Interest lifetime.

                       0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
                     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
                     | X |         ContextID         |
                     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

                      Figure 28: Context Identifier.

   The 7-bit ContextID is a locally-scoped unique identifier that
   represents contextual state shared between sender and receiver of the
   corresponding frame (see Figure 28).  If set the most significant bit
   indicates the presence of another, subsequent ContextID byte (see
   Figure 33).

   Context state shared between senders and receivers is removed from
   the compressed packet prior to sending, and reinserted after
   reception prior to passing to the upper stack.

   The actual information in a context and how it is encoded are out of
   scope of this document.  The initial distribution and maintenance of
   shared context is out of scope of this document.  Frames containing
   unknown or invalid CIDs MUST be silently discarded.

8.2.  En-route State

   In CCNx and NDN, Name TLVs are included in Interest messages, and
   they return in data messages.  Returning Name TLVs either equal the
   original Name TLV, or they contain the original Name TLV as a prefix.
   ICN LoWPAN reduces this redundancy in responses by replacing Name
   TLVs with single bytes that represent link-local HopIDs.  HopIDs are
   carried as Context Identifiers (see Section 8.1) of link-local scope
   as shown in Figure 29.

                       0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
                     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
                     | X |          HopID            |
                     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

                  Figure 29: Context Identifier as HopID.

   A HopID is valid if not all ID bits are set to zero and invalid
   otherwise.  This yields 127 distinct HopIDs.  If this range (1...127)
   is exhausted, the messages MUST be sent without en-route state
   compression until new HopIDs are available.  An ICN LoWPAN node that
   forwards without replacing the name by a HopID (without en-route
   compression) MUST invalidate the HopID by setting all ID-bits to
   zero.

   While an Interest is traversing, a forwarder generates an ephemeral
   HopID that is tied to a PIT entry.  Each HopID MUST be unique within
   the local PIT and only exists during the lifetime of a PIT entry.  To
   maintain HopIDs, the local PIT is extended by two new columns: HIDi
   (inbound HopIDs) and HIDo (outbound HopIDs).

   HopIDs are included in Interests and stored on the next hop with the
   resulting PIT entry in the HIDi column.  The HopID is replaced with a
   newly generated local HopID before the Interest is forwarded.  This
   new HopID is stored in the HIDo column of the local PIT (see
   Figure 30).

   Responses include HopIDs that were obtained from Interests.  If the
   returning Name TLV equals the original Name TLV, then the name is
   entirely elided.  Otherwise, only the matching name prefix is elided
   and the distinct name suffix is included along with the HopID.  When
   a response is forwarded, the contained HopID is extracted and used to
   match against the correct PIT entry by performing a lookup on the
   HIDo column.  The HopID is then replaced with the corresponding HopID
   from the HIDi column prior to forwarding the response (Figure 31).

         Figure 31: Eliding Name TLVs using en-route state (data).

   It should be noted that each forwarder of an Interest in an ICN
   LoWPAN network can individually decide whether to participate in en-
   route compression or not.  However, an ICN LoWPAN node SHOULD use en-
   route compression whenever the stateful compression mechanism is
   activated.

   Note also that the extensions of the PIT data structure are required
   only at ICN LoWPAN nodes, while regular NDN/CCNx forwarders outside
   of an ICN LoWPAN domain do not need to implement these extensions.

8.3.  Integrating Stateful Header Compression

   A CID appears whenever the CID flag is set (see Figure 5).  The CID
   is appended to the last ICN LoWPAN dispatch byte as shown in
   Figure 32.

          ...-------+--------+-------...-------+--...-+-------...

          ...-------+--------+-------...-------+--...-+-------...

         Figure 32: LoWPAN Encapsulation with ICN LoWPAN and CIDs

   Multiple CIDs are chained together, with the most significant bit
   indicating the presence of a subsequent CID (Figure 33).  This allows
   to use multiple shared contexts in compressed messages.

   The HopID is always included as the very first CID.

10.  Implementation Report and Guidance

   The ICN LoWPAN scheme defined in this document has been implemented
   as an extension of the NDN/CCNx software stack [CCN-LITE] in its IoT
   version on RIOT [RIOT].  An experimental evaluation for NDN over ICN
   LOWPAN with varying configurations has been performed in [ICNLOWPAN].
   Energy profilings and processing time measurements indicate
   significant energy savings, while amortized costs for processing show
   no penalties.

10.1.  Preferred Configuration

   The header compression performance depends on certain aspects and
   configurations.  It works best for the following cases:

   o  Signed time offsets compress as per Section 7 without the need for
      rounding.




Gundogan, et al.         Expires August 14, 2021               [Page 37]

Internet-Draft          ICN Adaptation to LoWPANs          February 2021


   o  Contextual state (e.g., prefixes) is distributed, such that long
      names can be elided from Interest and data messages.

   o  Frequently used TLV type numbers for CCNx and NDN stay in the
      lower range (< 255).

   Name components are of GenericNameComponent type and are limited to a
   length of 15 bytes to enable compression for all messages.

10.2.  Further Experimental Deployments

   An investigation of ICN LoWPAN in large-scale deployments with
   varying traffic patterns using larger samples of the different board
   types available remains as future work.  This document will be
   revised to progress it to the Standards Track, once sufficient
   operational experience has been acquired.  Experience reports are
   encouraged, particularly in the following areas:

   o  The name compression scheme (Section 5.2) is optimized for short
      name components of GenericNameComponent type.  An empirical study
      on name lengths in different deployments of selected use cases,
      such as smart home, smart city, and industrial IoT can provide
      meaningful reports on necessary name component types and lengths.
      A conclusive outcome helps to understand whether and how extension
      mechanisms are needed (Section 5.3.3).  As a preliminary analysis,
      [ICNLOWPAN] investigates the effectiveness of the proposed
      compression scheme with URLs obtained from the WWW.  Studies on
      CoAP [RFC7252] deployments can offer additional insights on naming
      schemes in the IoT.

   o  The fragmentation scheme (Section 4.2) inherited from 6LoWPAN
      allows for a transparent, hop-wise reassembly of CCNx or NDN
      packets.  Fragment forwarding [RFC8930] with selective fragment
      recovery [RFC8931] can improve the end-to-end latency and
      reliability, while it reduces buffer requirements on forwarders.
      Initial evaluations ([SFR-ICNLOWPAN]) show that a naive
      integration of these upcoming fragmentation features into ICN
      LoWPAN renders the hop-wise content replication inoperative, since
      Interest and data messages are reassembled end-to-end.  More
      deployment experiences are necessary to gauge the feasibility of
      different fragmentation schemes in ICN LoWPAN.

   o  Context state (Section 8.1) holds information that is shared
      between a set of devices in a LoWPAN.  Fixed name prefixes and
      suffixes are good candidates to be distributed to all nodes in
      order to elide them from request and response messages.  More
      experience and a deeper inspection of currently available and

Internet-Draft          ICN Adaptation to LoWPANs          February 2021


      upcoming protocol features is necessary to identify other protocol
      fields.

   o  The distribution and synchronization of contextual state can
      potentially be adopted from Section 7.2 of [RFC6775], but requires
      further evaluations.  While 6LoWPAN uses the Neighbor Discovery
      protocol to disseminate state, CCNx and NDN deployments are
      missing out on a standard mechanism to bootstrap and manage
      configurations.

   o  The stateful en-route compression (Section 8.2) supports a limited
      number of 127 distinct HopIDs that can be simultaneously in use on
      a single node.  Complex deployment scenarios that make use of
      multiple, concurrent requests can provide a better insight on the
      number of open requests stored in the Pending Interest Table of
      memory-constrained devices.  This number can serve as an upper-
      bound and determines whether the HopID length needs to be resized
      to fit more HopIDs to the cost of additional header overhead.

   o  Multiple implementations that generate and deploy the compression
      options of this memo in different ways will also add to the
      experience and understanding of the benefits and limitations of
      the proposed schemes.  Different reports can help to illuminate on
      the complexity of implementing ICN LoWPAN for constrained devices,
      as well as on maintaining interoperability with other
      implementations.

11.  Security Considerations

   Main memory is typically a scarce resource of constrained networked
   devices.  Fragmentation as described in this memo preserves fragments
   and purges them only after a packet is reassembled, which requires a
   buffering of all fragments.  This scheme is able to handle fragments
   for distinctive packets simultaneously, which can lead to overflowing
   packet buffers that cannot hold all necessary fragments for packet
   reassembly.  Implementers are thus urged to make use of appropriate
   buffer replacement strategies for fragments.  Minimal fragment
   forwarding [RFC8930] can potentially prevent fragment buffer
   saturation in forwarders.

   The stateful header compression generates ephemeral HopIDs for
   incoming and outgoing Interests and consumes them on returning Data
   packets.  Forged Interests can deplete the number of available
   HopIDs, thus leading to a denial of compression service for
   subsequent content requests.

   To further alleviate the problems caused by forged fragments or
   Interest initiations, proper protective mechanisms for accessing the

   link-layer should be deployed.  IEEE 802.15.4, e.g., provides
   capabilities to protect frames and restrict them to a point-to-point
   link, or a group of devices.

12.  IANA Considerations

12.1.  Reserving Space in the 6LoWPAN Dispatch Type Field Registry

   IANA has assigned dispatch values of the "6LoWPAN Dispatch Type
   Field" registry [RFC4944][RFC8025] with Page TBD1 for ICN LoWPAN.
   Table 2 represents updates to the registry.

Appendix A.  Estimated Size Reduction

   In the following a theoretical evaluation is given to estimate the
   gains of ICN LoWPAN compared to uncompressed CCNx and NDN messages.

   We assume that "n" is the number of name components, "comps_n"
   denotes the sum of n name component lengths.  We also assume that the
   length of each name component is lower than 16 bytes.  The length of
   the content is given by "clen".  The lengths of TLV components is
   specific to the CCNx or NDN encoding and outlined below.

A.1.  NDN

   The NDN TLV encoding has variable-sized TLV fields.  For simplicity,
   the 1 byte form of each TLV component is assumed.  A typical TLV
   component therefore is of size 2 (type field + length field) + the
   actual value.

A.1.1.  Interest

   Figure 34 depicts the size requirements for a basic, uncompressed NDN

A.2.  CCNx

   The CCNx TLV encoding defines a 2-byte encoding for type and length
   fields, summing up to 4 bytes in total without a value.

A.2.1.  Interest

   Figure 38 depicts the size requirements for a basic, uncompressed
   CCNx Interest.  No Hop-By-Hop TLVs are included, the protocol version
   is assumed to be 1 and the reserved field is assumed to be 0.  A
   KeyIdRestriction TLV with T_SHA-256 is included to limit the
   responses to Content Objects containing the specific key.
