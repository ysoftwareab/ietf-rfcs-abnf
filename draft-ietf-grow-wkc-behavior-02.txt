                  Well-Known Community Policy Behavior
                    draft-ietf-grow-wkc-behavior-02

Abstract

   Well-Known BGP Communities are manipulated inconsistently by current
   implementations.  This results in difficulties for operators.
   Network operators are encouraged to deploy consistent community
   handling across their networks, taking the inconsistent behaviors
   from the various bgp implementations they operate into consideration.
   Also, bgp implementors are expected to not create any further
   inconsistencies from this point forward.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to
   be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] only when they
   appear in all upper case.  They may also appear in lower or mixed
   case as English words, without normative meaning.

1.  Introduction

   The BGP Communities Attribute was specified in [RFC1997] which
   introduced the concept of Well-Known Communities.  In hindsight,
   [RFC1997] did not prescribe as fully as it should have how Well-Known
   Communities may be manipulated by policies applied by operators.
   Currently, implementations differ in this regard, and these
   differences can result in inconsistent behaviors that operators find
   difficult to identify and resolve.

   This document describes the current behavioral differences in order
   to assist operators in generating consistent community-manipulation
   policies in a multi-vendor environment, and to prevent the
   introduction of additional divergence in implementations.

2.  Manipulation of Communities by Policy

   [RFC1997] says:

   "A BGP speaker receiving a route with the COMMUNITIES path attribute
   may modify this attribute according to the local policy."

   A basic operational need is to add or remove one or more communities
   to the received set.  Another common need is to replace all received
   communities with a new set.  To simplify the second case, most BGP
   policy implementations provide syntax to "set" community that
   operators use to mean "remove any/all communities present on the
   update received from the neighbor, and apply this set of communities
   instead."

   Some operators prefer to write explicit policy to delete unwanted
   communities rather than using "set;" i.e. using a "delete community
   *:*" and then "add community x:y ..." configuration statements in an
   attempt to replace all received communities.  The same community
   manipulation policy differences described in the following section
   exist in both "set" and "delete community *:*" syntax.  For
   simplicity, the remainder of this document refers only to the "set"
   behaviors.

3.  Community Manipulation Policy Differences

   Vendor implementations differ in the treatment of certain Well-Known
   communities when modified using the syntax to "set" the community.
   Some replace all communities including the Well-Known ones with the
   new set, while others replace all non-Well-Known Communities but do
   not modify any Well-Known Communities that are present.

   These differences result in what would appear to be identical policy
   configurations having very different results on different platforms.

4.  Documentation of Vendor Implementations

   In this section we document the syntax and observed behavior of the
   "set" directive in several popular bgp implementations.

   In Juniper Networks' JunOS, "community set" removes all received
   communities, Well-Known or otherwise.

   In Cisco Systems' IOS-XR, "set community" removes all received
   communities except for the following:

                  Communities not removed by Cisco IOS/XR

                                  Table 1

   IOS-XR does allow Well-Known communities to be removed one at a time
   by explicit policy; for example, "delete community accept-own".
   Operators are advised to consult IOS-XR documentation and/or Cisco
   Systems support for full details.

   On Brocade NetIron: "set community X" removes all communities and
   sets X.

   In Huawei's VRP product, "community set" removes all received
   communities, well-Known or otherwise.

   In OpenBSD's OpenBGPD, "set community" does not remove any
   communities, Well-Known or otherwise.

4.1.  Note on an Inconsistency

   The IANA publishes a list of Well-Known Communities [IANA-WKS].

   IOS-XR's set of well-known communities that "set community" will not
   overwrite diverges from IANA's list.  Quite a few well-known
   communities from IANA's list do not receive special treatment in IOS-
   XR, and at least one specific community on IOS-XR's special treatment
   list (internet == 0:0) is not really on IANA's list -- it's taken
   from the "Reserved" range [0x00000000-0x0000FFFF].

   This merely notes an inconsistency.  It is not a plea to 'protect'
   the entire IANA list from "set community."

5.  Note for Those Writing RFCs for New Community-Like Attributes

   Care should be taken when establishing new [RFC1997]-like attributes
   (large communities, wide communities, etc) to avoid repeating this
   mistake.

6.  Action Items

   Unfortunately, it would be operationally disruptive for vendors to
   change their current implementations.

   Vendors SHOULD clearly document the behavior of "set" directive in
   their implementations.

   Vendors MUST ensure that any Well-Known Communities specified after
   this document's publication are removed by their "set" directive.

   Given the implementation inconsistencies described in this document,
   network operators are urged never to rely on any implicit
   understanding of a neighbor ASN's bgp community handling.  I.e.,
   before announcing prefixes with NO_EXPORT or any other community to a
   neighbor ASN, the operator should confirm with that neighbor how the
   community will be treated.

   Network operators are encouraged to limit their use of the "set"
   directive (within reason), to improve the readability of their
   configurations and hopefully to achieve behavioral consistency across
   platforms.

7.  Security Considerations

   Surprising defaults and/or undocumented behaviors are not good for
   security.  This document attempts to remedy that.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA Considerations other than to be aware that
   any future Well-Known Communities will be subject to the policy
   treatment described here.
