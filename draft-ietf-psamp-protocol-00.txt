 Abstract 
    
   This document specifies the export of packet information from a 
   PSAMP exporting process to a PSAMP colleting process. For export of 
   packet information the IP Flow Information eXport (IPFIX) protocol 
   is used. It is shown that The IPFIX protocol is well suited for this 
   purpose, because the IPFIX architecture matches the PSAMP 
   architecture very well and the means provided by the IPFIX protocol 
   are sufficient. The document specifies in detail how the IPFIX 
   protocol is used for PSAMP export of packet information.

 1. Open Issues 
    
   This section covers the open issues, still to be resolved/updated in 
   this draft: 
   - For section 6 "PSAMP requirements versus the IPFIX solution", 
   check if there are any other requirements in the [PSAMP-FRAMEWORK].  

 2. Introduction  

   The packet sampling (PSAMP) Working Group and the IP flow 
   information export (IPFIX) Working Group both aim at standardizing 
   technology for observing traffic from network devices and for 
   exporting some part of the observation. Also, both Working Groups 
   consider packet sampling as a component of their technology. While 
   for the IPFIX Working Group packet sampling is just one out of many 
   components considered, it is the focus of the PSAMP Working Group. 
    
   The PSAMP Working Group has agreed to use the IPFIX reporting 
   protocol if it's suitable for the PSAMP requirements. Therefore, a

                 PSAMP Protocol Specifications            October 2003 


   detailed analysis on the IPFIX protocol needs to be done and if 
   IPFIX is not suitable, then the reason should be stated exactly.  
    
   This document evaluates if the IPFIX protocol specifications could 
   fit the export format requirements for PSAMP device, how PSAMP could 
   use the IPFIX protocol, and whether the part of or the full IPFIX 
   protocol specifications are actually required. As we will conclude 
   that the IPFIX protocol is suitable as export protocol for PSAMP, 
   this document finally specifies in details how to use IPFIX. 
    
 3. Terminology 
    
   To be copied in from [PSAMP-FRAMEWORK4]. 
    
 4. Relationship between PSAMP and IPFIX  
    
 4.1 IPFIX Overview 

   The output of the IPFIX working group relevant for this draft, is 
   structured into three documents: 
      - IP flow information architecture [IPFIX-ARCH] 
      - IPFIX Protocol Specifications [IPFIX-PROTO] 
      - IP flow information export information model [IPFIX-INFO] 
    
   This table will help summarizing the IPFIX protocol specifications 
   [IPFIX-PROTO]. 
    
        FlowSet        Template  Record        Data Record  
  +----------------------------------------------------------------+  
  |                  |                    |  Flow Data Record(s)   |  
  | Data FlowSet     |          /         |          or            |  
  |                  |                    | Options Data Record(s) |  
  +----------------------------------------------------------------+  
  | Template FlowSet | Template Record(s) |           /            |  
  +----------------------------------------------------------------+  
  | Options Template | Options Template   |           /            |  
  | FlowSet          | Record(s)          |                        |  
  +----------------------------------------------------------------+  
    
   A Data FlowSet is composed of an Options Data Record(s) or Flow Data  
   Record(s); no Template Record is included.  
   The Flow Data Record is linked to a Template Record, and the Options 
   Data Record is linked to an Options Template Record.  
    


 Claise, et. al            Standard Track                    [Page 3] 
                 PSAMP Protocol Specifications            October 2003 


   A Template FlowSet is composed of Template Record(s); no Flow or 
   Options Data Record is included. 
    
   An Options Template FlowSet is composed of Options Template 
   Record(s); no Flow or Options Data Record is included. The Options 
   Template Record (and its corresponding Options Data Record) is used 
   to supply information about the metering process configuration or 
   specific data, rather than supplying information about IP flows.    
   The Options Data Records are sent on a regular basis, but not with 
   every Flow Data Record. 

 4.2 IPFIX and PSAMP Differences and Similarities 
    
   IPFIX achieves data reduction by aggregating per-packet IP layer 
   information into flow records. IPFIX produces and exports flow 
   records containing information per flow. This information is created 
   based on the observation of a potentially large number of packets.  
   In contrast, PSAMP achieves data reduction by reducing the packet 
   population via sampling. PSAMP generates and exports information per 
   packet. For more details please see the [PSAMP-FRAMEWORK] and 
   [PSAMP-SAMPLE-TECH]. 
    

 4.2.1   Export Point of View 

   From a pure export point of view, IPFIX will not distinguish a flow 
   record composed of several packets aggregated together, from a flow 
   record composed of a single packet.  
    
   As a conclusion, the PSAMP export can be seen as special IPFIX flow 
   record containing information about a single packet.  
    
   PSAMP doesn't have the notion of flow. But in order to avoid any 
   duplication in the terminology and as a consequence a redefinition 
   of the IPFIX protocol specifications, the IPFIX terminology [IPFIX-
   PROTO] is kept unchanged, even if some obvious pointers to the 
   notion of flow is made. For example: Flow Data Record, FlowSet, 
   etc... 

 4.2.2    Information Model Point of View 
    
   On one hand, the IPFIX export probably contains data types like 
   source IP address, destination IP address, ToS, etc. Refer to 


 Claise, et. al            Standard Track                    [Page 4] 
                 PSAMP Protocol Specifications            October 2003 


   [IPFIX-INFO] for more details. On the other hand, the PSAMP export 
   contains only the packet fragment in the base level of 
   functionality. Refer to [PSAMP-INFO] for more details. 
    
   As the templates are flexible, IPFIX will not distinguish from a 
   export point of view a flow record composed of several data types, 
   from a flow record composed of just a few data types (for example: 
   the packet fragment and the selector ID). 
    
   The information model data types exported in an IPFIX device and a 
   PSAMP device are not completely different but most of the time 
   overlapping. Note that, according to [PSAMP-FRAMEWORK] section 5.2 
   "Recommended Contents for Packet Reports", the PSAMP reporting 
   process SHOULD also report fields relating to the protocols used in 
   the packets, to the packet treatment and to the selection state 
   associated with the packet. 
    
   Thus the PSAMP reporting process will not limit itself to the export 
   the data types defined in [PSAMP-INFO], and can benefit from the 
   data types already defined in [IPFIX-INFO].  
    
   From the IPFIX point of view, the new PSAMP information model will 
   augment the data types that could be exported; for example, the hash 
   value, the selector ID or the packet-sampled. If a IPFIX metering 
   process create some flow records by sampling some packets, and if 
   both the IPFIX and PSAMP specifications are implemented on the 
   device, the IPFIX flow records could be augmented with extra data 
   types like the selector ID, the selector ID parameters, etc.  
    
   As the PSAMP information model is basically an extension to the 
   IPFIX information model, a formal process must be in place for the 
   addition of data types. The draft draft-bryant-ipfix-vendor-ie-00.tx 
   (not yet out) discusses some possibilities. 
    
 5. Using IPFIX for PSAMP   
    
 5.1 High Level View of the Integration 

   The Template Record in the Template FlowSet is used to describe the 
   different PSAMP data types that will be exported to the Collector. 
   The Collector decodes the Template FlowSet and knows which data 
   types to expect when it receives the Flow Data Records in the Data 
   FlowSet, i.e. the PSAMP Packet Reports. Typically, in the base level 



 Claise, et. al            Standard Track                    [Page 5] 
                 PSAMP Protocol Specifications            October 2003 


   of the PSAMP functionality, the Template FlowSet will contain the 
   input sequence number, the packet fragment (some number of 
   contiguous bytes from the start of the packet) and the selector ID. 
    
   The Options Template Record in the Options Template FlowSet is used 
   to describe the different PSAMP data types that concern the metering 
   process itself: sampling and/or filtering functions, plus the 
   associated parameters. The Collector decodes the Options Template 
   FlowSet and knows which data types to expect when it receives the 
   Options Data Records in the Data FlowSet, i.e. the PSAMP Report 
   Interpretation. Typically, the Options Template would contain the 
   Selector ID, the sampling or filtering functions, and the sampling 
   or filtering associated parameters. 
    
 5.2 Partial or Entire IPFIX Protocol Specifications Support 
    
   The "High level view of the integration" section 5.1 concludes that 
   PSAMP requires all the different possibilities of the IPFIX protocol 
   specifications [IPFIX-PROTO]. That is the 3 types of FlowSet (Data 
   FlowSet, Template FlowSet and Options Templates FlowSet), the 2 
   types of Templates Records (Template Record and Options Template 
   Record), and the 2 types of Data Record (Flow Data Record, Options 
   Data Record), as described again in the table below. 
    
        FlowSet        Template  Record        Data Record  
  +----------------------------------------------------------------+  
  |                  |                    |  Flow Data Record(s)   |  
  | Data FlowSet     |          /         |          or            |  
  |                  |                    | Options Data Record(s) |  
  +----------------------------------------------------------------+  
  | Template FlowSet | Template Record(s) |           /            |  
  +----------------------------------------------------------------+  
  | Options Template | Options Template   |           /            |  
  | FlowSet          | Record(s)          |                        |  
  +----------------------------------------------------------------+  

   As a consequence, PSAMP can't rely on a subset of the IPFIX protocol 
   specifications are described in [IPFIX-PROTO]. The entire IPFIX 
   protocol specifications MUST be implemented for the PSAMP export. 
        
 6. PSAMP Requirements versus the IPFIX Solution 
    




 Claise, et. al            Standard Track                    [Page 6] 
                 PSAMP Protocol Specifications            October 2003 


   [PSAMP-FRAMEWORK] describes some requirements that affect directly 
   the export protocol. Refer to the following sections: 
   section 3.2 "Reporting Process Requirements" 
   section 3.3 "Exporting Process Requirements" 
   section 5 "Reporting Process" 
    
   [PSAMP-FRAMEWORK] also describes in the section 3.1 one requirement 
   that, if not directly related to the export protocol, will put some 
   constraints on it: 
       Selection Process Requirements: 
       - Parallel Measurements: multiple independent measurement 
       processes at the same entity." 
      
   [PSAMP-FRAMEWORK] finally describes in the section 5 some 
   requirements regarding the reporting process. This series of 
   requirements specifies the different data types that MUST and SHOULD 
   reported to the collector. Nevertheless IPFIX, being a generic 
   export protocol, can export any data types as long as there are 
   described in the information model. So these requirements are mainly 
   targeted for the [PSAMP-INFO] document. 

 6.1 IPFIX Solution for the PSAMP Requirements 

   Let's address the PSAMP requirements one by one. 
    
   * Parallel Measurements: multiple independent measurement processes 
   at the same entity. Refer to [PSAMP-FRAMEWORK] section 3.1 "Selection 
   Process Requirements". 
    
   This requirement is addressed by exporting the Selector ID data type 
   in every packet report, so part of every Flow Data Records. Note that 
   without this requirement, exporting the Scope [IPFIX-PROTO] part of 
   every single packet report could have been sufficient.  

   * Transparency: allow transparent interpretation of measurements as 
   communicated by PSAMP reporting, without any need to obtain 
   additional information concerning the observed packet stream. Refer 
   to [PSAMP-FRAMEWORK] section 3.2 "Reporting Process Requirements". 
    
   This requirement is addressed by exporting the Selector ID in every 
   Flow Data Records (packet report) and exporting the associated 
   SAMPLING_ALGORITHM and SAMPLING PARAMETERS in the Options Data Record 



 Claise, et. al            Standard Track                    [Page 7] 
                 PSAMP Protocol Specifications            October 2003 


   (packet interpretation). So the all the metering process parameters 
   are linked to the Flow Data Records. 
    
   * Robustness to Information Loss: allow robust interpretation of 
   measurements with respect to reports missing due to data loss, e.g. 
   in transport, or within the measurement, reporting or exporting 
   processes. Inclusion in reporting of information that enables the 
   accuracy of measurements to be determined. Refer to [PSAMP-FRAMEWORK] 
   section 3.2 "Reporting Process Requirements". 
    
   An Options Templates MUST be sent on regular basis. This Options 
   Template contains for example the total number of packet report 
   exported from the PSAMP device, the total number of packet observed, 
   etc... Thus the Collector can compare the number of packet report 
   received per selector ID with the number actually metered and/or 
   sent. In case of discrepancy, a new sampling rate could be computed.  
    
   * Faithfulness: all reported quantities that relate to the packet 
   treatment MUST reflect the router state and configuration encountered 
   by the packet at the time it is received by the measurement process. 
   Refer to [PSAMP-FRAMEWORK] section 3.2 "Reporting Process 
   Requirements". 
    
   This requirement doesn't concern the export protocol itself but the 
   metering process, even if described in the "Reporting Process 
   Requirements" section. 
    
   * Privacy: selection of the content of packet reports will be 
   cognizant of privacy and anonymity issues while being responsive to 
   the needs of measurement applications, and in accordance with RFC 
   2804. Full packet capture of arbitrary packet streams is explicitly 
   out of scope. Refer to [PSAMP-FRAMEWORK] section 3.2 "Reporting 
   Process Requirements". 
    
   This requirement doesn't concern the export protocol itself, even if 
   described in the "Reporting Process Requirements" section. 
    
   * Timeliness: reports on selected packets MUST be made available to 
   the collector quickly enough to support near real time applications. 
   Specifically, any report on a packet MUST be dispatched within 1 
   second of the time of receipt of the packet by the measurement 
   process. Refer to [PSAMP-FRAMEWORK] section 3.3 "Export Process 
   Requirements".  


 Claise, et. al            Standard Track                    [Page 8] 
                 PSAMP Protocol Specifications            October 2003 


    
   The IPFIX protocol specifications [IPFIX-PROTO] describe an 
   inactivity timeout for the flow expiration. This inactivity timeout 
   is configurable, with a minimum value of 0 for immediate expiration. 
   Note that this minimum value of 0 will force every single Flow Data 
   Record to contain information about a single packet and not an 
   aggregation of packets. 
    
   * Congestion Avoidance: export of a report stream across a network 
   MUST be congestion avoiding in compliance with RFC 2914. Refer to 
   [PSAMP-FRAMEWORK] section 3.3 "Export Process Requirements".  
    
   IPFIX, by its charter, MUST also respect this requirement. 
    
   * Secure Export: 
       - confidentiality: the option to encrypt exported data MUST be 
       provided. 
       - integrity: alterations in transit to exported data MUST be 
       detectable at the collector   
       - authenticity: authenticity of exported data MUST be verifiable 
       by the collector in order to detect forged data. 
        
   The motivation here is the same as for security in IPFIX export. 
   Refer to [PSAMP-FRAMEWORK] section 3.3 "Export Process 
   Requirements".  
     
 7. Low Level View of the Integration 

 7.1 Sampling Case, PSAMP Base Level of Functionality 
    
   EDITOR∆S NOTE: LET'S ASSUME THAT THE [PSAMP-INFO] DEFINES THE 
   FOLLOWING DATA TYPES  
        SEQUENCE-NUMBER: the input sequence number, 
        PACKET-SAMPLE: some number of contiguous bytes from the start 
        of the packet 
        SELECTOR-ID: 
        SAMPLING-ALGORITHM: 
        SAMPLING-PARAMETER1, SAMPLING-PARAMETERS2, ETC... 

   As described in the section 5.1 "Mandatory Contents of Packet 
   Reports" of [PSAMP-FRAMEWORK], the packet reports must contain: 
   - the input sequence number(s), denoted the SEQUENCE-NUMBER in 
   [PSAMP-INFO] 




 Claise, et. al            Standard Track                    [Page 9] 
                 PSAMP Protocol Specifications            October 2003 


   - some number of contiguous bytes from the start of the packet, 
   denoted the PACKET-SAMPLE in [PSAMP-INFO]. 
   Thus the Template FlowSet defines a Template Record composed of 
   SEQUENCE-NUMBER, PACKET-SAMPLE and SELECTOR-ID. 
    
   The report interpretation must contain: 
   - the sampling algorithm, denoted SAMPLING-ALGORITHM in [PSAMP-INFO] 
   - the sampling parameters denoted SAMPLING-PARAMETER1, SAMPLING-
   PARAMETER2, etc... in [PSAMP-INFO] 
   The Options Template FlowSet defines a Options Template Record 
   composed of SELECTOR-ID, SAMPLING-ALGORITHM, SAMPLING-PARAMETERS. 
    
   Finally the Data FlowSet is used to export the Flow Data Record(s) 
   containing the real values of SEQUENCE-NUMBER, PACKET-SAMPLE and 
   SELECTOR-ID. The Data FlowSet is also used to export the       
   Options Data Record(s) containing the real values of SELECTOR-ID, 
   SAMPLING-ALGORITHM, SAMPLING-PARAMETERS. 
    
   By means of the SELECTOR-ID, the Collector can link any Flow Data 
   Record to the corresponding Options Data Record. That is, any Flow 
   Data Record to the metering process funtion and parameters. 

 7.1.1    Example 

   EDITOR∆S THIS MUST BE A FULL EXAMPLE LIKE IN SECTION 13 OF [IPFIX-
   PROTO]. 
   THE [PSAMP-INFO] MUST BE FIRST PUBLISHED. 

 7.2 Sampling Case 
    
   The PSAMP reporting process SHOULD also report fields relating to 
   the protocols used in the packets, to the packet treatment and to 
   the selection state associated with the packet, as specified in 
   [PSAMP-FRAMEWORK] section 5.2 "Recommended Contents for Packet 
   Reports". 
    
   Let's take the same example as in the section 7.1, but let's add the 
   export of the destination BGP Autonomous System (AS) [1771] and of 
   the input interface 
    
   The packet reports MUST contain: 
   - the input sequence number(s), denoted the SEQUENCE-NUMBER in 
   [PSAMP-INFO] 


 Claise, et. al            Standard Track                   [Page 10] 
                 PSAMP Protocol Specifications            October 2003 


   - some number of contiguous bytes from the start of the packet, 
   denoted the PACKET-SAMPLE in [PSAMP-INFO] 
   - the destination BGP AS , denoted destinationAS in [IPFIX-INFO] 
   - the input interface, denoted ingressPort in [IPFIX-INFO] 
   Thus the Template FlowSet defines a Template Record composed of 
   SEQUENCE-NUMBER, PACKET-SAMPLE and SELECTOR-ID, destinationAS and 
   ingressPort. 
    
   The report interpretation will remain unchanged and must contain: 
   - the sampling algorithm, denoted SAMPLING-ALGORITHM in [PSAMP-INFO] 
   - the sampling parameters denoted SAMPLING-PARAMETER1, SAMPLING-
   PARAMETER2, etc... in [PSAMP-INFO] 
   The Options Template FlowSet is used to define this template 
   composed of SELECTOR-ID, SAMPLING-ALGORITHM, SAMPLING-PARAMETERS. 
    
   Finally Data FlowSet is used to export the Flow Data Record(s) 
   containing the real values of SEQUENCE-NUMBER, PACKET-SAMPLE and 
   SELECTOR-ID, destinationAS and ingressPort. The Data FlowSet is also 
   used to export the Options Data Record(s) containing the real values 
   of SELECTOR-ID, SAMPLING-ALGORITHM, SAMPLING-PARAMETERS. 
    
   As a consequence, the collector can link any Flow Data Record to the 
   sampling algorithm and sampling parameters, by means of the 
   SELECTOR-ID value.

   [IPFIX-PROTO]. THE [PSAMP-INFO] MUST BE FIRST PUBLISHED. 

 7.3 Filtering Case 

   EDITOR∆S NOTE: ACTUALLY THE EXAMPLE WILL BE QUITE SIMILAR TO 7.1 AND 
   7.2 BUT WILL DEPEND A LOT ON HOW WE WILL DEFINE THE FILTERING IN 
   [IPFIX-INFO]. 


 7.3.1    Example

 8. Security Considerations 

   As IPFIX has been selected as the PSAMP export protocol and as the 
   PSAMP security requirements are not stricter than the IPFIX security 
   requirements, refer to the IPFIX export protocol [IPFIX-PROTO] for 
   the security considerations.
