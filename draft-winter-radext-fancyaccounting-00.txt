Internet-Draft           RADIUS Fancy Accounting              March 2011


1.  Introduction

   RADIUS Accounting [RFC2866] defines counters for octets and packets,
   both in the incoming and outgoing direction.  Usage of these counters
   enables an operator create volume-based billing models and to execute
   proper capacity planning on its infrastructure.

   The Accounting model is based on the assumption that all traffic in a
   user session is treated equally; i.e. that there are no differences
   in the billing model of one class of traffic over another.

   Actual deployments suggest that this assumption is no longer valid.
   In particular, different traffic classes are defined with DSCP; and
   billing the use of these traffic classes separately is an
   understandable request.

   Plus, the introduction of dual-stack operation on links creates an
   understandable interest of getting separate statistics about the
   amount of IPv4 vs. IPv6 usage on a link; be it for billing or
   statistical reasons.

   This document defines Accounting attributes that supplement (but not
   replace) the accounting counters in RFC2866.  It utilizes the new
   "extended attributes" in RADIUS to group accounting reports about
   traffic classes together.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in RFC 2119.  [RFC2119]

2.  Definitions

2.1.  Unsigned 64-Bit Integer datatype

   RADIUS Accounting in RFC2866 uses two distinct attributes, Acct-
   (Input Output)-Octets and Acct-(Input Output) Gigawords, to transport
   64 bit counter values.  The reasons for defining a 64 Bit value
   across two attributes are historic.  This specification defines a new
   datatype, "Unsigned 64 Bit Integer" to convey 64 bit counter values
   natively.

   Type: UINT64 - Length: 8 octets - Value: 64 bit unsigned integer,
   most significant byte first

2.2.  Acct-Traffic-Class attribute

   The attribute Acct-Traffic-Group is a container for a group of sub-
   attributes which specify the class of traffic that is being reported
   about, and the amount of traffic in a user session that falls into
   this class.

   Attribute: 245.1 Acct-Traffic-Class - Type: TLV - Length: >3 octets

   There can be multiple instances of this grouped attribute in a
   Accounting-Interim-Update or a Accounting-Stop packet.  The attribute
   MUST NOT be present in an Accounting-Start packet.

   It is not required that the sum of all traffic in all instances is
   the total sum of octets and packets in the user's session.  I.e. the
   traffic classes used in the Accounting packet do not need to
   partition the total traffic in non-overlapping segments.

   The total number of octets and packets in a user session continues to
   be sent in the RFC2866 attributes.

2.2.1.  Acct-Traffic-Class-Id attribute

   The attribute Acct-Traffic-Class-Id, sub-attribute in the group Acct-
   Traffic-Class, defines the class of traffic for which the other
   attributes in the instance of Acct-Traffic-Class count octets and
   packets.

   Every group instance MUST contain exactly one of
   Acct-Traffic-Class-Id or Acct-Traffic-Class-Name (see below).  I.e.
   if Acct-Traffic-Class-Id is present in the Acct-Traffic-Class
   instance, then the attribute Acct-Traffic-Class-Name MUST NOT be
   present.

   Attribute: 245.1.1 Acct-Traffic-Class-Id - Type: Enum - Values:

   1.  IPv4

   2.  IPv6

   3.  DSCP 0

   4.  DSCP 1

   5.  ...

   Allocations of new values for this attribute are subject to expert
   review.

2.2.2.  Acct-Traffic-Class-Name attribute

   The attribute Acct-Traffic-Class-Name, sub-attribute in the group
   Acct-Traffic-Class, defines the class of traffic for which the other
   attributes in the instance of Acct-Traffic-Class count octets and
   packets.

   Every group instance MUST contain exactly one of
   Acct-Traffic-Class-Id (see above) or Acct-Traffic-Class-Name.  I.e.
   if Acct-Traffic-Class-Name is present in the Acct-Traffic-Class
   instance, then the attribute Acct-Traffic-Class-Id MUST NOT be
   present.

   Attribute: 245.1.2 Acct-Traffic-Class-Name - Type: STRING - Value:
   1-250 octets

2.2.3.  Acct-Traffic-Class-Input-Octets attribute

   The attribute Acct-Traffic-Class-Input-Octets, sub-attribute in the
   group Acct-Traffic-Class, carries the number of octets that belong to
   the class of traffic indicated by Acct-Traffic-Class-Id or Acct-
   Traffic-Class-Name and have been sent to the entity for which the
   accounting packet was generated.

   Attribute: 245.1.3 Acct-Traffic-Class-Input-Octets - Type: UINT64 -
   Value: number of octets sent to entity, matching the class of traffic

2.2.4.  Acct-Traffic-Class-Output-Octets attribute

   The attribute Acct-Traffic-Class-Output-Octets, sub-attribute in the
   group Acct-Traffic-Class, carries the number of octets that belong to
   the class of traffic indicated by Acct-Traffic-Class-Id or Acct-
   Traffic-Class-Name and have been sent from the entity for which the
   accounting packet was generated.

   Attribute: 245.1.4 Acct-Traffic-Class-Output-Octets - Type: UINT64 -
   Value: number of octets sent from entity, matching the class of
   traffic

2.2.5.  Acct-Traffic-Class-Input-Packets attribute

   The attribute Acct-Traffic-Class-Input-Packets, sub-attribute in the
   group Acct-Traffic-Class, carries the number of packets that belong
   to the class of traffic indicated by Acct-Traffic-Class-Id or Acct-
   Traffic-Class-Name and have been sent to the entity for which the
   accounting packet was generated.

   Attribute: 245.1.5 Acct-Traffic-Class-Input-Packets - Type: UINT64 -

   Value: number of packets sent to entity, matching the class of
   traffic

2.2.6.  Acct-Traffic-Class-Output-Packets attribute

   The attribute Acct-Traffic-Class-Output-Packets, sub-attribute in the
   group Acct-Traffic-Class, carries the number of packets that belong
   to the class of traffic indicated by Acct-Traffic-Class-Id or Acct-
   Traffic-Class-Name and have been sent from the entity for which the
   accounting packet was generated.

   Attribute: 245.1.6 Acct-Traffic-Class-Output-Packets - Type: UINT64 -
   Value: number of packets sent from entity, matching the class of
   traffic

3.  Example

   A NAS is configured to create statistics regarding IPv6 usage of CPE
   for statistical reasons, and of the amount of HTTP traffic sent to
   the example.com web site for billing reasons.

   User john@example.com starts a user session, transfers 1200 Bytes in
   10 packets via IPv6 to the internet, and receives 4500 Bytes in 30
   packets over IPv6 from the internet.

   In the same session, The user visits the IPv4-only example.com web
   site by sending 6000 bytes in 4 packets to the web site, and
   receiving 450000 Bytes in 35 packets from the web site.

   Then, the user terminates the session and an Accounting-Stop packet
   is generated.

   The NAS sends the recorded octet and packet values to his RADIUS
   Accounting server.  Since there is no ENUM value for "Traffic on
   TCP/80 to example.com, all IP versions" in Acct-Traffic-Group-Id, the
   NAS indicates this class of traffic in a corresponding string.  The
   relevant attributes in the Account-Stop packet are:

   Accounting-Traffic-Group

      Accounting-Group-Id = IPv6

      Acct-Input-Octets = 4500

      Acct-Output-Octets = 1200

      Acct-Input-Packets = 30

Internet-Draft           RADIUS Fancy Accounting              March 2011


      Acct-Output-Octets = 10

   Accounting-Traffic-Group

      Accounting-Group-Name = "Traffic on TCP/80 to example.com, all IP
      versions"

      Acct-Input-Octets = 450000

      Acct-Output-Octets = 6000

      Acct-Input-Packets = 35

      Acct-Output-Octets = 4

4.  Privacy Considerations

   Reveals user's traffic usage patterns.  Shouldn't be sent
   unencrpyptedly.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has actions for IANA.  TBD later.
