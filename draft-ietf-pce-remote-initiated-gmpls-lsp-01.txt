     Internet-Draft  draft-ietf-pce-remote-initiated-gmpls-lsp-01.txt 
      
     1. Introduction 

        The Path Computation Element communication Protocol (PCEP) 
        provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to 
        perform route computations in response to Path Computation 
        Clients (PCCs) requests. PCEP Extensions for PCE-initiated LSP 
        Setup in a Stateful PCE Model draft [I-D. draft-ietf-pce-
        stateful-pce] describes a set of extensions to PCEP to enable 
        active control of MPLS-TE and GMPLS network.  

        [I-D. draft-ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] describes the setup and 
        teardown of PCE-initiated LSPs under the active stateful PCE 
        model, without the need for local configuration on the PCC. This 
        enables realization of a dynamic network that is centrally 
        controlled and deployed. However, this specification is focused 
        on MPLS networks, and does not cover the GMPLS networks (e.g., 
        WSON, OTN, SONET/ SDH, etc. technologies). This document 
        complements [I-D. draft-ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] by 
        addressing the requirements for remote-initiated GMPLS LSPs. 
        These requirements are covered in Section 2 of this draft. The 
        PCEP extensions for remote initiated GMPLS LSPs are specified in 
        Section 3.  

     2. Requirements for Remote-Initiated GMPLS LSPs 

        [I-D. draft-ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] specifies procedures 
        that can be used for creation and deletion of PCE-initiated LSPs 
        under the active stateful PCE model. However, this specification 
        does not address GMPLS requirements outlined in the following: 

        -  GMPLS support multiple switching capabilities on per TE link 
          basis. GMPLS LSP creation requires knowledge of LSP switching 
          capability (e.g., TDM, L2SC, OTN-TDM, LSC, etc.) to be used 
          [RFC3471], [RFC3473].  

        -  GMPLS LSP creation requires knowledge of the encoding type 
          (e.g., lambda photonic, Ethernet, SONET/ SDH, G709 OTN, etc.) 
          to be used by the LSP [RFC3471], [RFC3473].  

        -  GMPLS LSP creation requires information of the generalized 
          payload (G-PID) to be carried by the LSP [RFC3471], [RFC3473].  

        -  GMPLS LSP creation requires specification of data flow 
          specific traffic parameters (also known as Tspec), which are 
          technology specific.  

        -  GMPLS also specifics support for asymmetric bandwidth 
          requests [RFC6387].  
                        Expires January 2016                 [Page 3] 






     Internet-Draft  draft-ietf-pce-remote-initiated-gmpls-lsp-01.txt 
      
        -  GMPLS extends the addressing to include unnumbered interface 
          identifiers, as defined in [RFC3477].  

        -  In some technologies path calculation is tightly coupled with 
          label selection along the route. For example, path calculation 
          in a WDM network may include lambda continuity and/ or lambda 
          feasibility constraints and hence a path computed by the PCE 
          is associated with a specific lambda (label). Hence, in such 
          networks, the label information needs to be provided to a PCC 
          in order for a PCE to initiate GMPLS LSPs under the active 
          stateful PCE model. I.e., explicit label control may be 
          required.  

        -  GMPLS specifics protection context for the LSP, as defined in 
          [RFC4872] and [RFC4873].  

     3. PCEP Extensions for Remote-Initiated GMPLS LSPs 

        LSP initiate (PCInitiate) message defined in [I-D. draft-ietf-
        pce-pce-initiated-lsp] needs to be extended to include GMPLS 
        specific PCEP objects as follows:  

     3.1. Generalized Endpoint in LSP Initiate Message 

        This document does not modify the usage of END-POINTS object for 
        PCE initiated LSPs as specified in [I-D. draft-ietf-pce-pce-
        initiated-lsp]. It augments the usage as specified below.  

        END-POINTS object has been extended by [I-D. draft-ietf-pcep-
        gmpls-ext] to include a new object type called "Generalized 
        Endpoint". PCInitiate message sent by a PCE to a PCC to trigger 
        a GMPLS LSP instantiation SHOULD include the END-POINTS with 
        Generalized Endpoint object type. Furthermore, the END-POINTS 
        object MUST contain "label request" TLV. The label request TLV 
        is used to specify the switching type, encoding type and GPID of 
        the LSP being instantiated by the PCE.  

        The unnumbered endpoint TLV can be used to specify unnumbered 
        endpoint addresses for the LSP being instantiated by the PCE. 
        The END-POINTS MAY contain other TLVs defined in [I-D. draft-
        ietf-pcep-gmpls-ext].  

        If the END-POINTS Object of type Generalized Endpoint is missing 
        the label request TLV, the PCC MUST send a PCErr message with 
        Error-type=6 (Mandatory Object missing) and Error-value= TBA 
        (LSP request TLV missing). 

        If the PCC does not support the END-POINTS Object of type 
        Generalized Endpoint, the PCC MUST send a PCErr message with 
        Error-type = 3 (Unknown Object), Error-value = 2(unknown object 
        type).

     3.2. GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH object in LSP Initiate Message 

           LSP initiate message defined in [I-D. draft-ietf-pce-pce-
        initiated-lsp] can optionally include the BANDWIDTH object. 
        However, the following possibilities cannot be represented in 
        the BANDWIDTH object: 

           - Asymmetric bandwidth (different bandwidth in forward and 
        reverse direction), as described in [RFC6387]. 

           - Technology specific GMPLS parameters (e.g., Tspec for 
        SDH/SONET, G.709, ATM, MEF, etc.) are not supported. 

        GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH object has been defined in [I-D. draft-
        ietf-pcep-gmpls-ext] to address the above-mentioned limitation 
        of the BANDWIDTH object.  

        This document specifies the use of GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH object 
        in PCInitiate message. Specifically, GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH 
        object MAY be included in the PCInitiate message. The 
        GENERALIZED-BANDWIDTH object in PCInitiate message is used to 
        specify technology specific Tspec and asymmetrical bandwidth 
        values for the LSP being instantiated by the PCE.  

     3.3. Protection Attributes in LSP Initiate Message 

        This document does not modify the usage of LSPA object for PCE 
        initiated LSPs as specified in [I-D. draft-ietf-pce-pce-
        initiated-lsp]. It augments the usage of LSPA object in LSP 
        Initiate Message to carry the end-to-end protection context this 
        also includes the protection state information.  

        The LSP Protection Information TLV of LSPA in the PCInitiate 
        message can be used to specify protection attributes of the LSP 
        being instantiated by the PCE.  

     3.4. ERO in LSP Initiate Object  

        This document does not modify the usage of ERO object for PCE 
        initiated LSPs as specified in [I-D. draft-ietf-pce-pce-
        initiated-lsp]. It augments the usage as specified in the 
        following sections. 

     3.4.1. ERO with explicit label control  

        As mentioned earlier, there are technologies and scenarios where 
        active stateful PCE requires explicit label control in order to 
        instantiate an LSP.  

        Explicit label control (ELC) is a procedure supported by RSVP-
        TE, where the outgoing label(s) is (are) encoded in the ERO. [I-
        D. draft-ietf-pcep-gmpls-ext] extends the <ERO> object of PCEP 
                        Expires January 2016                 [Page 5] 






     Internet-Draft  draft-ietf-pce-remote-initiated-gmpls-lsp-01.txt 
      
        to include explicit label control. The ELC procedure enables the 
        PCE to provide such label(s) directly in the path ERO.  

        The extended ERO object in PCInitiate message can be used to 
        specify label along with ERO to PCC for the LSP being 
        instantiated by the active stateful PCE.  

     3.4.2. ERO with Path Keys 

        There are many scenarios in packet and optical networks where 
        the route information of an LSP may not be provided to the PCC 
        for confidentiality reasons.  A multi-domain or multi-layer 
        network is an example of such networks. Similarly, a GMPLS User-
        Network Interface (UNI) [RFC4208] is also an example of such 
        networks.  

        In such scenarios, ERO containing the entire route cannot be 
        provided to PCC (by PCE). Instead, PCE provides an ERO with Path 
        Keys to the PCC. For example, in the case UNI interface between 
        the router and the optical nodes, the ERO in the LSP Initiate 
        Message may be constructed as follows:  

       - The first hop is a strict hop that provides the egress 
          interface information at PCC. This interface information is 
          used to get to a network node that can extend the rest of the 
          ERO. (Please note that in the cases where the network node is 
          not directly connected with the PCC, this part of ERO may 
          consist of multiple hops and may be loose).  
       - The following(s) hop in the ERO may provide the network node 
          with the path key [RFC5520] that can be resolved to get the 
          contents of the route towards the destination.  
       - There may be further hops but these hops may also be encoded 
          with the path keys (if needed).  
        
       This document does not change encoding or processing roles for 
       the path keys, which are defined in [RFC5520].  

     3.4.3. Switch Layer Object 

        [draft-ietf-pce-inter-layer-ext-07] specifies the SWITCH-LAYER 
        object which defines and specifies the switching layer (or 
        layers) in which a path MUST or MUST NOT be established. A   
        switching layer is expressed as a switching type and encoding 
        type. [I-D. draft-ietf-pcep-gmpls-ext], which defines the GMPLS 
        extensions for PCEP, suggests using the SWITCH-LAYER object. 
        Thus, SWITCH-LAYER object can be used in the PCInitiate message

     Internet-Draft  draft-ietf-pce-remote-initiated-gmpls-lsp-01.txt 
      
        to specify the switching layer (or layers) of the LSP being 
        remotely initiated. 

     3.5. LSP delegation and cleanup 

        LSP delegation and cleanup procedure specified in [I-D. draft-
        ietf-pcep-gmpls-ext] are equally applicable to GMPLS LSPs and 
        this document does not modify the associated usage.  

     4. Security Considerations 

        To be added in future revision of this document.  

     5. IANA Considerations 

     5.1. PCEP-Error Object  

        This document defines the following new Error-Value: 

        Error-Type  Error Value 

        6           Error-value=TBA:  LSP Request TLV missing
