Abstract

   This document describes the terminology and gives a network model for
   different strategies concerning Voiceband Data (VBD) transport services.
   The purpose of this effort is to set the reference space for describing
   and evaluating Megaco/H.248 signaling procedures. Primary scope are
   voiceband data services, typically inherent part in voice-over-packet
   networks (e.g., like Internet Telephony).
   Motivation:
   VBD calls typically start out as a voice call. The modems on the VBD
   devices at the Termination detect the switch to VBD (like facsimile) and
   fax modem or data modem transmission begins. With the development of
   Voice over IP, many CODECs have been developed which are optimized for
   the transmission and reception of voice. In creating these CODECs, VBD
   transport may not reliably be used over the same transmission channel.
   In an effort to optimize the transmission of VBD, specialized protocols
   (e.g., T.38, or V.MoIP) have been developed to provide a more reliable
   transport, minimize bandwidth usage, etc.

1. Definitions

   For the purpose of this document, the following definitions shall apply.


1.1 Gateway & Terminal Types

   Access Gateway: A type of gateway that provides a User to Network
   Interface (UNI) such as ISDN BRI/PRI.

   Gateway: A gateway converts media provided in one type of network to the
   format required in another type of network. For example, a gateway could

   terminate bearer channels from a Switched Circuit Network (e.g., DS0s)
   and media streams from a packet network (e.g., RTP streams in an IP
   network).

   On-Ramp Gateway: The access point that is called by an originating DCE
   that interfaces to the IP network. (Abbreviated to MG1)

   Off-Ramp Gateway: The IP network access point that calls an Answering
   DCE. (Abbreviated to MG2)

   Emitting Gateway: The access point that is called by a sending fax
   equipment (e.g., G3FE) that interfaces to the IP network. (Abbreviated
   to MG1)

   Receiving Gateway: The access point that is called by a receiving fax
   equipment that interfaces to the IP network. (Abbreviated to MG2)

   Network Access Server (NAS): A gateway that provides access to an IP-
   based data network. In some cases also known as a RAS, Remote Access
   Server.

   Universal Gateway: MG supporting VoIP as well as DoIP (= NAS) functions.

   Teletype (TTY): A term used by the deaf and hard of hearing for a device
   which incorporates a FSK (Frequency Shift Keying) modem. This term
   originates with the electromagnetic Teletypewriters originally used for
   this communications.

1.2 Packet Network Transport Services

   The prime Êtransport services∆ for Voiceband Data (considered in this
   document) are derived from TERMINAL types used in traditional SCNs,
   e.g.,

   - FAX MODEM (e.g., Group 3 Fax Equipment),
   - DATA MODEM (e.g., Computer with V-series Digital Circuit Equipment),
   - TEXT MODEM,
   - others

   Note:see also [3] respectively the phrase "traditional facsimile".

2. Motivation and Problem Definition

   Voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) networks must support interworking
   with SCNs (e.g., PSTN, N-ISDN, 2G-PLMN) and traditional terminal types.
   Initial and prime scope are voice oriented terminals and services (e.g.,
   speech telephony), but also data terminals using voice based transport.
   This is leading to Data-over-Voice (DoV) transport in the SCN, as well
   as a consequence then in the IP domain (= DoVoIP), too. A dedicated
   subset of data services, - and primary scope of this document -, shall


Schwarz             Work-in-Progress - August 2003            [Page 5]
               Voiceband Data in Megaco/H.248 Networks    August 2002


   be summarized under the umbrella of "Voiceband Data" (VBD). This subset
   of data services is reusing the voice frequency band (= telephony band
   or voiceband).

   This is leading to the requirement that a VoIP network and a VoIP
   gateway MUST support at least:
   - VoIP, and
   - VBDoIP.

   The term 'DoIP' shall further denote the gateway capability of a Network
   Access Server (NAS).

   Generally there are two basic models suitable for VBD transport in an IP
   network:

   (1) VBD over VoIP ("the VoIP bearer connection with a suitable 'voice
   configuration'"; abbreviated as VBDoVoIP), or
   (2) VBD over a data-capable IP transport (shall abbreviated as VBDoDoIP)

   The first class of operation shall be called "Pass-Through" service
   (also called "Pseudo Transparent" service) and the second one "Relay"
   service. Such a transport service differentiation does make sense for
   inband signaling traffic, too, e.g., like DTMF, CAS bits, general tones
   or telephony signals.

   The rationale behind is primarily related to the IP network
   characteristics, architecture, and intended usage:

   (1) "PASS-THROUGH transport services" are used for applications
       - upon networks with a high and guaranteed Quality of Service,
       - there is no constraint on the available IP bandwidth,
       - where performance of modulation is robust enough (in case of modem
         traffic),
       - well managed and controllable IP networks (Intranets, private IP
         based networks),
       - or other reasons.

   (2) "RELAY transport services" are designed for, respectively providing,
       - public IP networks (Internet),
       - IP networks in general that have such impairments as packet loss
         and jitter,
       - reduced IP network bandwidth (hence reduced cost to service
         providers),
       - enhanced transport (e.g., support of bandwidth control [8]),
       - increased reliability of VBD connections, compared to pass-through
         services,
       - increased interworking between some modems,
       - increased link speed in some modem connections,
       - others.

   Table 1 provides a summary from gateway perspective. Considered are the
   major traffic classes and corresponding transport options. Table 1 is
   showing only a small set of exemplary services, by far no exhaustive
   list.

   The functional block 'Media Conversion Unit' (MCU) within a gateway, as
   well as the numerous MCU operation modes, will be introduced in the next
   section.

   The packet-oriented IP network shall be vertically separated in
    - a CONTROL Domain (hosting the MGC function), and
    - a TRANSPORT Domain with the MGs.

   Note: A potential SERVICE or APPLICATION Domain, on top of the Control
         Domain, is beyond the scope of this document.

   The Media Gateway Controller (MGC) is characteristically a subfunction
   within a Call Agent (CA). The CA is synonymously often denoted as Call
   Connection Agent (CCA), Call Server (CLS), Call Serving Node (CSN),
   Softswitch (SX), or others.
   Note: The MGC may also be located in an H.323 [6] Gatekeeper (GK), or
   integrated in a narrowband switching system.

   Figure 1 is showing the general case with multiple Call Agents in a
   single Control Domain. The CA-to-CA signaling protocol is beyond the
   scope of this document.

   The originating MG and terminating MG shall be denoted as MG1
   respectively MG2. For instance, MG1 is providing the Emitting GW
   function (E-MG) in case of T.38 [7], or the On-Ramp GW in case of V.MoIP
   [8]. MG2 is corresponding to the Receiving GW function (R-MG), or the
   Off-Ramp GW in case of V.MoIP ditto.

   The scope of this document are Megaco/H.248 procedures at the MGC-MG
   interface. But due to the different handling possibilities of VBD
   services by the Transport Domain, the MG system architecture shall be
   briefly considered. The primary functional block of a MG shall be
   denoted as Bearer Interworking Function (B-IWF). The B-IWF is housing
   so-called Media Conversion Units (MCU), the responsible (physical)
   entity for Voice, Voiceband Data, etc. processing.
   Note: The MCU function might be physically realized by an
   Encoder/Decoder chip, DSP, Protocol Processor, ASIC, etc.

   Additionally the two communication directions shall be differentiated:
   - Circuit-to-Packet (C2P) direction, and
   - Packet-to-Circuit (P2C) direction
   The underlying motivation is that both directions, - MCU_C2P and MCU_P2C
   -, may be generally working in different operation modes or states (see
   following subsection).

   Figure 2 is illustrating the corresponding Megaco/H.248 Context model.


3.2 Major States of a Media Gateway

   3.2.1 State Machines



Schwarz             Work-in-Progress - August 2003           [Page 10]
               Voiceband Data in Megaco/H.248 Networks    August 2002


   An MCU generally supports a couple of different media conversion
   functions. A specific set of such functions shall be denoted as
   operation mode, or briefly as mode. The Megaco/H.248 Context is
   specifying and describing properties and media attributes, required for
   a dedicated call, respectively network service.

   There are principally different transport options for a bearer
   connection in the IP Transport Domain (see subsection 1.2). Such a
   specific transport option is corresponding to a specific MCU operation
   mode. A set of operation modes shall be abstracted by a state model,
   reflecting meaningful combinations for dedicated call services.
   The state of a bearer connection may be changed several times during the
   lifetime of a call. (Example, a PSTN speech telephony terminal with
   integrated fax equipment, allowing generally a call scenario, e.g., with
   speech-fax-speech phasing.)

   For two party call configurations, there are generally following four
   STATE MACHINES associated with a specific (IP) bearer connection:
   - MG1_MCU_C2P,
   - MG1_MCU_P2C,
   - MG2_MCU_C2P,
   - MG2_MCU_P2C

   There are many services where both directions are always in the same
   state, i.e., in which cases both state machines, associated with the
   same MG (MG1 or MG2), may be considered as synchronized within a MG. In
   these cases may a single state machine (per MG_MCU) be considered.
   [Note: briefly noted as "MG is in state Êxyz∆".]

   3.2.3 State Description

   At any given time, each direction of the MG MCU and the packet bearer
   connection is in exactly one state. The several MCU modes are briefly
   elaborated (based on [8, 9]):

   * VOICE (states Vu and Vc):
     - audio received by the MG1_MCU is encoded for transmission and
       transmitted through the packet network to the decoder (MG2_MCU)
       using CODECs appropriate for speech but not necessarily appropriate
       for data modem or facsimile modulations;
     - additional codings such as RFC 2833 for comfort noise, DTMF digits,
       telephony signals, etc. may also optionally be used;
     - packets containing coded audio received by the MG2_MCU are decoded
       to audio and played out; and
     - processing of the audio appropriate to speech, such as echo
       cancellation, DC removal, dynamic range reduction, latency
       adjustment, etc. may be performed by either the MG1_MCU or the
       MG2_MCU or both.

   * VOICEBAND DATA (VBD "Pass-Through"):
     - audio received by the MG1_MCU is encoded for transmission and
       transmitted through the packet network to the MG2_MCU using CODECs
       appropriate for data modem and facsimile modulations (e.g., G.711 or
       high bitrate G.726);
     - additional codings such as RFC 2833 for comfort noise, DTMF digits,
       telephony signals, etc. may also optionally be used;

               Voiceband Data in Megaco/H.248 Networks    August 2002


     - packets containing coded audio received by the MG2_MCU are decoded
       to audio and played out; and
     - processing of the audio inappropriate to data modem and facsimile
       modulations, such as echo cancellation, DC removal, dynamic range
       reduction, latency adjustment, etc. must not be performed by either
       the MG1_MCU or the MG2_MCU or both.
     Note: VBD mode is also often called "PSEUDO TRANSPARENT MODE"

   * FACSIMILE RELAY:
     - audio received by the MG1_MCU is demodulated using facsimile
       modulation and protocol specifications, and facsimile images
       extracted from the audio are transmitted to the MG2_MCU using the
       T.38 protocol; and
     - packets containing facsimile images received by the MG2_MCU are
       remodulated onto audio using facsimile modulation and protocol
       specifications and played out.

   * MODEM RELAY:
     - audio received by the MG1_MCU is demodulated using data modem
       modulation and protocol specifications, and data extracted from the
       audio are transmitted to the MG2_MCU using the V.MoIP protocol [8];
       and
     - packets containing data received by the MG2_MCU are remodulated onto
       audio using data modem modulation and protocol specifications and
       played out.

   * TEXT RELAY:
     [ffs]

   * CIRCUIT MODE DATA:
     - samples received by the MG1_MCU are packetized and passed to the IP
       network with no modification (= "TRANSPARENT MODE" or "CLEAR CHANNEL
       MODE")
     - no signal processing is performed in the MCUs,
     - packets received by the MG2_MCU are de-packetized, and samples are
       passed to the circuit interface without modification

   * PACKET MODE DATA:
     [ffs]

   * FRAME MODE DATA:
     [ffs]

   The terms "Capability Set" and "Profile" are used interchangeably in
   this document.

4.1 Introduction
   Functionality and capabilities of a gateway are differing due to the
   variety of network architecture approaches, network convergence and
   evolution scenarios, or set of supported services and their temporay
   distribution. Purpose of this chapter is a rough description of some
   meaningful gateway profiles. Solely considered gateway types are
   Megaco/H.248 controlled Media Gateways in IP networks.

   Note: Frame Mode Data (FMD) traffic is typically related to the SCN
         signaling plane, and shall be not further considered anymore in
         the following.


4.2 Voice-oriented Media Gateways

   Table 2 provides an overview of service sets concerning voice-oriented
   MGs. Every profile MUST support VoIP as a minimum.

   Note:   A typical example for profile 'D' may be the support of specific
           N-ISDN bearer services, like I.231.1 (sometimes called "ISDN-
           over-IP"; approximation or emulation of ISDN services through IP
           networks).


4.3 Voice & Data Media Gateways

   Detailed gateway profiles are ffs. Table 3 is only indicating the
   minimum capability set of a so-called universal gateway. Every MG in
   this category MUST support VoIP and DoIP as a minimum.

   Note:   DoIP respectively the PMD functionality MAY require a
           Megaco/H.248 NAS package [Ref. to be inserted].


5. Scope of this Document

   Focus of this document are voiceband related services. That's why the MG
   and MCU modes CMD, PMD and FMD will not be further considered. The scope
   of this document shall be limited on voice-oriented MGs with voiceband
   data support.

   Note: draft document <draft-leurs-megaco-t38-callflows> [10] is
   proposing detailed Megaco/H.248 procedures for FR Media Gateways capable
   of autonomous transition between VoIP And FoIP. Therefore, [10] is
   spanning 'E' type gateways.

   Several tradeoffs have to be considered for a specific VBD transport
   service, controlled by Megaco/H.248. This document shall merely
   illustrate the diverse points of discussion. An important goal is to
   offer a framework that allows further development and expansion of
   capabilities in voice oriented IP networks.


6. Service Control - Network Strategies

6.1 Overall Service Control Aspects



Schwarz             Work-in-Progress - August 2003           [Page 16]
               Voiceband Data in Megaco/H.248 Networks    August 2002


   Figure 3 did summarize the prime operation modes, i.e., the MCU states,
   but following topics were not yet elaborated:
   (1) potential and meaningful STATE TRANSITIONS,
   (2) TYPES of EVENTS, triggering such state changes, and
   (3) principle SOURCES of such EVENTS (called decision instances in this
       document).

   The first aspect is related to specific services and superordinated call
   scenarios. Such transition scenarios are beyond the scope of this
   document, and shall be addressed in companion proposals (like [10]). The
   outcome are principle Megaco/H.248 signaling procedures.

   The second and third aspects are the topics of this section, because the
   set of potential events may reflect general network approaches and
   service strategies.

6.2 Principle Decision Levels for Service Changes

   The term SERVICE shall denote a specific transport service by the IP
   Transport Domain. This is again related to a specific MCU operation mode
   respectively state from gateway perspective.

   State transitions may principally initiated by decision instances listed
   in Table 4.


      | Level | Decision Instance
      +-------+-----------------------------------------------------------
      |   I   | Call Agent (CA) and Media Gateway Controller (MGC)
      |       | [-> decision by Control Domain]
      +-------+-----------------------------------------------------------
      |  IIa  | Media Gateways (MG1 & MG2); local and remote side
      |       | [-> decision in Transport Domain, without Control Domain
      |       |     involvement]
      +-------+-----------------------------------------------------------
      |  IIb  | Media Gateway (MG); only local side
      |       | [-> decision in Transport Domain, MG locally, without
      |       |     Control Domain involvement]
      +-------+-----------------------------------------------------------
      |  III  | Media Conversion Unit (MCU)
      |       | [-> decision MG locally, but MCU internally]
      +-------+-----------------------------------------------------------
         Table 4: Decision Instances behind MCU State Transitions

   The reason behind case (IIa) may be, for instance, a kind of
   notification, CAPABILITIES EXCHANGE between both MGs, or other (e.g.,
   like H.245 in H.323 domains). Capability support has following principal
   elements [11]:

   - Expression of the capabilities of the sender/recipient (= MG1 & MG2),
     and
   - Protocol by which capabilities are exchanged (negotiation).

   Capability description (e.g., SDP based) and capability exchange
   protocols and procedures are beyond the scope of this document.


   Table 4 is outlining three principal decision levels which are based on
   different wide control horizons. Following terms shall be used to denote
   the various levels:

    - Level I   = STRICT CONTROL
                  Call Agent is involved in (prime) operation mode changes,
                  MGC is controlling the MG(s),
                  MG is triggering the state transition by re-configuring
                  the MCU.

    - Level II  = AUTONOMOUS
                  Let the MG(s) control and decide how to handle the VBD
                  call without Call Agent involvement. The MGs are loosely
                  controlled by their Call Agent(s).

    - Level III = AUTOMATIC
                  Let the MCU(s) control and decide how to handle the VBD
                  call without involvement of other local MG functions
                  (e.g., resource management).

   The different levels shall be elaborated in more detail in subsequent
   sections.


6.3 STRICT Control (by CA & MGC)

   For further study.

6.4 AUTONOMOUS Control (by MG)

   For further study.

6.5 AUTOMATIC Control (by MCU)

   For further study.


7. Interworking Considerations

   Realizations of (circuit-switched based) voiceband data services in
   packet networks is inherently implying interworking aspects. The

               Voiceband Data in Megaco/H.248 Networks    August 2002


   framework of this interworking scenario, - SCN interworking with
   Megaco/H.248 controlled IP packet domains -, is already covered in the
   previous sections.
   Scope of this section are interworking cases between different style of
   packet network architectures, whereby one domain shall be Megaco/H.248
   based.

   Interworking is generally addressing:
   - Network Interworking, and
   - Service Interworking.

   Due to the limited perspective of MGC and MG entities, interworking
   shall be separated in:

   (1) Interworking in Transport Domain (e.g., T.38 related), and
   (2) Control Domain (e.g., prime impacts on Megaco/H.248).

   Typical interworking requirements may be derived, e.g., for following
   VBD service and following types of packet networks:

   - T.38 in H.323 Domains
   - T.38 in SIP Domains

   [...]

   For further study.

   [Note: Section 7 will be covered by separated document in the next
   document revision.]


8. Operational & Functional Goals

   To accommodate current use as well as future growth, Megaco/H.248
   signaling procedures for VBD transport services should have a simple
   minimum set of required features that will guarantee interoperability,
   as well as mechanisms by which higher capability gateways can be
   deployed into a packet network of lower capability gateways while
   ensuring interoperability.

   [to be completed; simplicity, reliability, robustness, capability
   exchange aspects, etc.]


9. Security Considerations

   Security considerations are addressed as per Section 10 of RFC 3015
   [12]. Megaco/H.248 procedures for VBD transport service control
   inheriting the security requirements of Megaco/H.248.
