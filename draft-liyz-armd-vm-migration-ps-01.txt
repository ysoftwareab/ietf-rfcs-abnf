Abstract

   VM migration is one of the key features provided by larger scaled
   virtualized data center. Various optimizations for address resolution
   in such network are expected to be provided by ARMD. This draft
   describes the problems that are introduced by VM migration. It is
   expected that solutions provided by ARMD would address these problems.

1. Introduction

   When virtualization is used in data center, it makes the server
   management more flexible and consequently more complex. One of the
   reasons is it would be much easier to move a VM (virtual machine)
   without the service interruption among physical servers. It is called
   VM migration. VM migration may occur due to server pool re-
   arrangement for maintenance, relocation, energy saving, load
   balancing, utilization optimization and other management purposes.

   Figure 1 shows a typical VM migration scenario within a data center.
   VM1 moves from server 1 to server 2. VM migration is under control of
   the virtual machine management tools. It is known in advance by VM
   manager that where the VM would be moved to. Movement could occur
   between different servers of the same rack or across different racks
   or even across data centers.

   The assumptions of VM migration include

   o VM does not change its MAC and IP address after migration

   o Service provided by VM should not be interrupted. Some packet loss
      may be observed at the moment of migration; however it should be
      recoverable by upper layer protocol and should not cause
      connection termination.

   VM itself has no knowledge about its movement and therefore it should
   not be expected that VM would do anything special to accommodate the
   migration. On the other hand, hypervisor in a server participates in
   the whole migration process. Hypervisor in the destination server
   knows when the migration finishes and usually it will send certain
   data or control packet to signal the network entities that VM
   migration completes and it is ready to receive packets at the new
   location. Such signaling packet may be gratuitous ARP request,
   gratuitous ARP reply or reverse ARP depending on different
   implementation.

   It has been shown in [I-D. dunbar-arp-for-large-dc-problem-statement]
   that there are basically two types of approaches used in virtualized
   larger layer 2 data center to solve the scaling issue,

   1. Address translation: map raw flat MAC address to some
      hierarchical or manageable MAC address.

   2. Address encapsulation: use additional header to encapsulate the
      frame/packet.

   Either address translation or encapsulation could be performed by
   address registration or source address learning. In any case, VM live
   migration is a fundamental scenario to handle. The following sections
   talk about the problems caused by VM migration.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

3. Some dimensions to consider in supporting VM migration

   When we investigate the impact on ARP traffic by VM migration in data
   center, there are several dimensions to examine.

   o Network topology. VM can be moved within a single layer 2 domain
      in current practice. The range of the domain restricts the
      movement. Therefore position of default gateways normally
      determines the size of the layer 2 network as they terminates the
      layer 2 traffic and handles the layer 3 traffic. If the default
      gateway is aligned with ToR, VM can only migrate within the same
      rack. If the default gateway is aligned with core switches, VM can
      be moved within the whole network. Therefore larger sized layer 2
      network is more preferred considering VM migration.

   o Protocol used at layer 2. Traditionally STP is used. In order to
      enjoy more efficient use of all links and faster convergence and
      support multipathing for fat tree structure based data center,
      routing based layer 2 protocol like TRILL or SPB are expected to
      be used in data center. They both provide additional encapsulation
      at the edge switches and make the core nodes simpler at the
      forwarding plane. Different operational recommendation may be
      needed for each.



4. ARP Problems in address resolution in VM migration

   Take figure 1 as example. During the process of VM1 movement, other
   hosts may still keep sending data packet to VM1. The switches
   including ToR1 have no knowledge that VM1 is going to move. All the
   packets still go to server 1 as normal. At the moment VM1 stops
   receiving packet from server 1, the incoming packet could be lost as
   the destination becomes a black hole to other hosts. After a short
   while, VM1 should be able to receive the packet from its new location
   server 2. It is very common that hypervisor at server 2 will flood a
   gratuitous ARP request/reply for VM1 to inform the whole broadcast
   domain about VM1's new location.

   In traditional switches, there is no ARP table. Only routers/gateways
   keep the ARP table. In some of the approaches, switches have the ARP

   cache for local host and/or remote host. We will study the impact for
   both.

  4.1 No ARP message to indicate VM having left a server.

  Gratuitous ARP is a message to inform others a new node coming up for
  free. It is used for IP/MAC correspondence announcement. At same time,
  switches perform source MAC address learning to know the MAC/port/vlan
  correspondence. However there is no gratuitous ARP "leave" message to
  make others forget the previous learned source address and location
  information. Aging is a normal way to delete the cached information.
  Black hole may last as long as aging out time.

  There are several ways to make it up.

   o Operationally if the VM sends out the gratuitous ARP or reverse
      ARP right after the migration, and the message is not lost, it
      will fresh the ARP table entry on gateways and switches. It is the
      most common way given that migration process, i.e. the time from
      VM stopping receiving frame at old location to VM starting
      receiving frame at new location, is very short and the frame lost
      is rare.

   o In virtualized system architecture, virtual machine management
      tool like vCenter knows a VM is going to move at management level.
      Therefore it is possible to delete the stale cache through
      management plane and it needs collaboration between virtual
      machine manager and network manager.

   o Use some lightweight keepalive mechanism to guarantee the
      freshness of the local ARP entry. It is called ARP detection in
      some implementations. It decreases the possibility of re-issuing
      gratuitous ARP for silent hosts. If an ARP entry becomes invalid,
      some specific message needs to be flooded to let remote switches
      "forget" the entry if switch also has the ARP cache for remote
      hosts.



  4.2 Uncertainty of ARP message type after VM migration.

  Currently there is no standard behavior defined for hypervisor in VM
  migration. Hypervisor may send gratuitous ARP request/reply and even
  reverse ARP after migration completes. The reason for sending the
  signaling message is to inform the switches and gateways about the new
  location of VM1 and make them have the correct entry for
  interface/port in the ARP/MAC table.

  However, there are a large variety of ARP implementations. We have
  tested on one of switches in market on various ARP messages; the
  result is in figure 2.

  The testing scenario is as follows. VM1 moves from server 1 to server
  2 which connect to GW1 via interface 1 and interface 2 accordingly.
  Before migration, ARP table of GW1 has the entry to include IP/MAC of
  VM1 and its outgoing interface is itf1. After migration, hypervisor of
  server 2 may flood ARP or other signaling message; it is also possible
  that it keeps silent and does not send out any signaling packet in
  which case black hole problem would become more significant. The
  expected result should be GW1 updates its ARP table entry to correlate
  VM1 with interface 2 (itf2) as soon as possible when VM finishes
  migration.

  There are various implementations of switches and hypervisors. Figure
  2 shows one example that depending on the type of ARP message sent by
  hypervisor and handling of switch, result may not be always as what we
  expect.

  It is recommended that interface number for an ARP table entry on
  gateway should be updated for any ARP messages including ARP
  request/reply and reverse ARP no matter if the frame is destined for
  itself.

  4.3 ARP message unreliable delivery

  Gratuitous ARP from an end host is normally sent three times in order
  to survive from frame loss. However it is hard to 100% avoid ARP frame
  loss. Some analysis says a typical congestion is about 10-20 seconds
  which is longer than 3 retries of gratuitous ARP. In case the ARP
  frames are lost after VM migration, the gateway is not able to
  correctly update the corresponding interface number in ARP table entry.
  For inbound traffic from gateway, the gateway will keep sending it to
  the old location which is a black hole. It is noted that the ARP table
  will not be updated by data frames. Hence even the VM sends out data
  frame from new location, gateway will not update the relevant entry of
  ARP table.

  For internal traffic within data center, if switches do not have any
  ARP cache, MAC/port correspondence will be updated accordingly along
  the path. As most of the data traffic should be bidirectional, MAC
  table should be correctly updated after a short while. Everything
  should be ok. On the other hand, if switches have ARP caching table,
  situation would be more completed depending on where the frame is lost,
  if switches cache remote ARP entry.

  If ARP table is updated by data frames in addition ARP frame, it will
  solve most of the problems here. However, it may bring some
  performance and security issue.

  4.4 Duplicate address detection

  Gratuitous ARP is also used for duplicate address detection. For
  example, in Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 3 or higher installed, a
  statically addressed Windows NT computer will perform a gratuitous ARP
  up to 3 times: 1 time when the TCP/IP stack initializes, and 2 more
  times after .5 and 1 second intervals, if no response is received.
  Whenever a statically configured IP address is changed, Windows NT
  sends a single gratuitous ARP. If Windows NT receives a response to a
  gratuitous ARP, it disables the interface that issued the gratuitous
  ARP, generates an event (event ID 26), and generates a pop-up dialog
  box on the console warning the user that a duplicate IP address has
  been detected resulting in the shutdown of the affected interface. For
  DHCP leased address, Windows NT sends a single gratuitous ARP.

Internet-Draft        PS on ARP in VM migration             March 2011


  VM migration normally takes time in magnitude of second depending on
  the amount of memory to be copied over at the last stage. If another
  VM starts up and tries to use the same IP address of the migrated VM
  right within its migration process, there will be no duplicate address
  detected. Therefore the new VM can safely uses that IP address. Then
  after the migrated VM completes the movement, there will be duplicated
  IP address running at same time or migrated VM will block itself from
  using that IP address. Neither behavior is desired.

5. Security Considerations

   It may not be easy to tell if an ARP sent from a new location is
   really for a migrated VM or it is a spoofed one. With VM migration,
   some security mechanisms are not applicable any more, like:

   o MAC locking: locking a MAC address to a specific physical port of
      the switch.

   o DHCP snooping: binding IP/MAC by snooping DHCP ACK to port of
      switch. VM does not send DHCP request again after migration. Some
      mechanism should be introduced to move the binding to the new port
      in migration case.

   VM migration itself does not introduce more risk to ARP messages.
   However some existing solutions to solve ARP security issues may
   wrongly treat ARP after migration as illegal one.



6. IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA actions.

7. Conclusions

   VM migration brings extra problem to larger scale virtualized data
   center. Any solution in ARMD, like directory based address resolution,
   distributed caching, or specially designed control protocol, should
   consider the VM migration carefully. It is suggested to include the
   information from the draft in the problem statement of impact on
   address resolution for massive number of hosts in the data center.
