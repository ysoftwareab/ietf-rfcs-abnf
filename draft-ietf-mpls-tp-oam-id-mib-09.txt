INTERNET DRAFT             MPLS-TP OAM ID MIB          September 1, 2015


1  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects for modeling a
   Multiprotocol Label Switching- (MPLS) [RFC3031] based transport
   profile.

   This MIB module should be used for performing the OAM (Operations,
   Administration, and Maintenance) operations for MPLS Tunnel LSP
   (Label Switched Path), Pseudowires, and Sections.

   At the time of writing, SNMP SET is no longer recommended as a way to
   configure MPLS networks as was described in [RFC3812].  However,
   since the MIB modules specified in this document are intended to work
   in parallel with the MIB modules for MPLS specified in [RFC3812],
   certain objects defined here are specified with MAX-ACCESS of read-
   write or read-create so that specifications of the base tables in
   [RFC3812] and the new MIB modules in this document are consistent.
   Although the examples described in Section 6 specify means to
   configure OAM identifiers for MPLS-TP tunnels, this should be seen as
   indicating how the MIB values would be returned in the specified
   circumstances having been configured by alternative means.

2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI). This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant with the SMIv2, which is described in STD
   58(RFC2578, RFC2579, RFC2580).

4. Feature List

   The MPLS transport profile OAM identifiers MIB module is designed
   to satisfy the following requirements and constraints:

      -  The MIB module supports configuration of OAM identifiers for
         MPLS point-to-point Tunnels, point-to-multipoint LSPs, co-
         routed bidirectional LSPs, associated bidirectional LSPs, and
         Pseudowires.


5. Brief description of MIB Objects

   The objects described in this section support the functionality
   described in documents [RFC5654] and [RFC6370].  The tables support
   both IP-compatible and ICC-based OAM identifiers configurations
   for MPLS Tunnels, LSPs, and Pseudowires.

5.1.  mplsOamIdMegTable

   The mplsOamIdMegTable is used to manage one or more
   Maintenance Entities (MEs) that belong to the same transport path.

 


Aldrin, et al.           Expires March 4, 2016                  [Page 4]

INTERNET DRAFT             MPLS-TP OAM ID MIB          September 1, 2015


   When a new entry is created with mplsOamIdMegOperatorType set to
   ipCompatible (1), then as per [RFC6370] (MEG_ID for LSP
   is LSP_ID and MEG_ID for PW is PW_Path_ID), MEP_ID can be
   automatically formed.

   For ICC-based transport path, the user is expected to configure
   the ICC identifier explicitly in this table for MPLS Tunnels, LSPs,
   and Pseudowires.



5.2.  mplsOamIdMeTable


   The mplsOamIdMeTable defines a relationship between two points
   (source and sink) of a transport path to which maintenance and
   monitoring operations apply. The two points that define
   a maintenance entity are called Maintenance Entity Group
   End Points (MEPs).

   In between MEPs, there are zero or more intermediate points,
   called Maintenance Entity Group Intermediate Points (MIPs).
   MEPs and MIPs are associated with the MEG and can be shared by
   more than one ME in a MEG.

6. MPLS OAM identifier configuration for MPLS LSP example

   In this section, we provide an example of the OAM identifier
   configuration for an MPLS co-routed bidirectional LSP.

   This example provides usage of MEG and ME tables for management and
   monitoring operations of an MPLS LSP.

   This example considers the OAM identifiers configuration on a
   head-end LSR to manage and monitor an MPLS LSP.
   Only relevant objects which are applicable for IP-based OAM
   identifiers of MPLS co-routed bidirectional LSP are illustrated here.

      In mplsOamIdMegTable:

      {
        -- MEG index (Index to the table)
        mplsOamIdMegIndex                 = 1,
        mplsOamIdMegName                  = "MEG1",
        mplsOamIdMegOperatorType          = ipCompatible (1),
        mplsOamIdMegServicePointerType    = lsp (1),
        mplsOamIdMegMpLocation            = perNode(1),
      -- Mandatory parameters needed to activate the row go here

INTERNET DRAFT             MPLS-TP OAM ID MIB          September 1, 2015


        mplsOamIdMegRowStatus             = createAndGo (4),
        mplsOamIdMegPathFlow      
                             = coRoutedBidirectionalPointToPoint (2)
      }

      This will create an entry in the mplsOamIdMegTable to manage and
      monitor the MPLS tunnel.

      The following ME table is used to associate the path information
      to a MEG.

      In mplsOamIdMeTable:

      {
      -- ME index (Index to the table)
       mplsOamIdMeIndex                  = 1,

      -- MP index (Index to the table)
       mplsOamIdMeMpIndex                = 1,
       mplsOamIdMeName                   = "ME1",
       mplsOamIdMeMpIfIndex              = 0,
       -- Source MEP id is derived from the IP-compatible MPLS LSP
       mplsOamIdMeSourceMepIndex         = 0,
       -- Sink MEP id is derived from the IP-compatible MPLS LSP
       mplsOamIdMeSinkMepIndex           = 0,
       mplsOamIdMeMpType                 = mep (1),
       mplsOamIdMeMepDirection           = down (2),
       --  RowPointer MUST point to the first accessible column of an
      --  MPLS LSP
       mplsOamIdMeServicePointer         = mplsTunnelName.1.1.10.20,
      -- Mandatory parameters needed to activate the row go here
       mplsOamIdMeRowStatus              = createAndGo (4)
      }

        MAX-ACCESS    not-accessible STATUS        current
        DESCRIPTION
             "An entry in this table represents MPLS-TP maintenance
              entity. This entry represents the ME if the source and
              sink MEPs are defined.

              A ME is a point-to-point entity. One ME has two such MEPs.
              A MEG is a group of one or more MEs. One MEG can have
              two or more MEPs.

              For point-to-point LSP, one MEG has one ME and this ME
              is associated two MEPs (source and sink MEPs) within 
              a MEG. Each mplsOamIdMeIndex value denotes the ME within
              a MEG.

              In case of unidirectional point-to-point transport paths,
              a single unidirectional Maintenance Entity is defined to
              monitor it and mplsOamIdMeServicePointer points to
              unidirectional point-to-point path.

              In case of associated bidirectional point-to-point
              transport paths, two independent unidirectional
              Maintenance Entities are defined to independently monitor
              each direction and each mplsOamIdMeServicePointer MIB
              object points to unique unidirectional transport path.
              This has implications for transactions that terminate at
              or query a MIP, as a return path from MIP to source MEP
              does not necessarily exist within the MEG.

              In case of co-routed bidirectional point-to-point
              transport paths, a single bidirectional Maintenance Entity
              is defined to monitor both directions congruently and
              mplsOamIdMeServicePointer MIB object points to co-routed
              bidirectional point-to-point transport path.

              In case of unidirectional point-to-multipoint transport
              paths, a single unidirectional Maintenance entity for each
              leaf is defined to monitor the transport path from the
              root to that leaf and each leaf has different transport

8. Security Consideration

   This MIB relates to a system that will provide network connectivity
   and packet forwarding services. As such, improper manipulation of the
   objects represented by this MIB may result in denial of service to a
   large number of end-users.

   There are number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-create. Such objects may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
   The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment
   without proper protection can have negative effect on network
   operations.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects
   with a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
   It is thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access
   to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these
   objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.  These are
   the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   - mplsOamIdMegTable and mplsOamIdMeTable collectively show 
 


Aldrin, et al.           Expires March 4, 2016                 [Page 27]

INTERNET DRAFT             MPLS-TP OAM ID MIB          September 1, 2015


     the MPLS OAM characteristics. If an Administrator does not want to
     reveal this information, then these tables should be considered
     sensitive/vulnerable.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even
   if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), there
   is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access
   and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB
   module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826]. Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an OID for the MIB module from the "MIB
   Transmission Group - MPLS STD" sub-registry of the "Internet-standard
   MIB - Transmission Group" registry for the MPLS-TP OAM ID MIB module
   specified in this document.
