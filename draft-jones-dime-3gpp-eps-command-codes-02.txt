1.  Introduction

   The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is defining the
   Evolved Packet System (EPS) as part of their Release 8 architecture.
   As part of this architecture, the interfaces based on the Diameter
   protocol [RFC3588] require the definition of two new Diameter
   applications.

   The 3GPP S6a/S6d application (vendor-specific application id:
   1677251) enables the transfer of subscriber related data between the
   Mobile Management Entity (MME) and Home Subscriber Server (HSS) on
   the S6a interface and between the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN)
   and Home Subscriber Server (HSS) on the S6d interface.

   The 3GPP S13/S13' application (vendor-specific application id:
   1677252) enables the Mobile Equipment Identity check procedure
   between the Mobile Management Entity (MME) and Equipment Identity
   Register (EIR) on the S13 interface and between the Serving GPRS
   Support Node (SGSN) and Equipment Identity Register (EIR) on the S13'
   interface.

   Both Diameter applications are defined under the 3GPP vendor-id
   "10415" and are defined in [TS29.272].  This document defines the
   assigned values of the command codes used in these applications.


2.  Terminology

   The base Diameter specification (Section 1.4 of [RFC3588]) defines
   most of the terminology used in this document.  Additionally, the
   terms and acronyms defined in [TS29.272] are used in this document.


3.  Command Codes

   The 3GPP S6a/S6d application described in section 5 of [TS29.272]
   requires the allocation of command code values for the following
   command pairs:

   o  3GPP-Update-Location-Request/Answer (ULR/ULA)

   o  3GPP-Cancel-Location-Request/Answer (CLR/CLA)

   o  3GPP-Authentication-Information-Request/ Answer (AIR/AIA)

   o  3GPP-Insert-Subscriber-Data-Request/Answer (IDR/IDA)

Internet-Draft           3gpp-eps-command-codes               March 2009


   o  3GPP-Delete-Subscriber-Data-Request/Answer (DSR/DSA)

   o  3GPP-Purge-UE-Request/Answer (PUR/PUA)

   o  3GPP-Reset-Request/Answer (RSR/RSA)

   o  3GPP-Notify-Request/Answer (NOR/NOA)

   The 3GPP S13/S13 application described in section 6 of [TS29.272]
   requires the allocation of a command code value for the following
   command pair:

   o  3GPP-ME-Identity-Check-Request/Answer (ECR/ECA)


4.  IANA Considerations

   This section provides guidance to the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA) regarding registration of values related to the
   Diameter protocol, in accordance with BCP 26 [RFC5226].

   This document defines values in the namespace that has been defined
   in the Diameter Base specification [RFC3588].  Section 11 of
   [RFC3588] (IANA Considerations) details the assignment criteria.
   IANA is requested to allocate the following command code values:

5.  Security Considerations

   This document describes command codes used in applications which
   build on top of the Diameter base protocol and the same security
   considerations described in [RFC3588] are applicable to this
   document.  No further extensions are required beyond the security
   mechanisms offered by [RFC3588].
