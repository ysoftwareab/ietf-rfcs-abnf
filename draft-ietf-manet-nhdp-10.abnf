c = d  is a comparison operator, returning true if the value of the
      left side (c) is equal to the value of the right side (d). c and d
      may be values, addresses, or unordered lists (they must be of the
      same type).  If c and d are unordered lists, then they are
      considered to be equal if they contain the same set of elements,
      regardless of the order in which they are recorded in either list
      (in which case c is contains d, and d contains c).  If c and d are
      addresses, they are considered equal only if their prefix lengths
      are also equal.

I_manet = true) then:
Value = LOST also performs the function of an Address Block TLV with
Type = OTHER_NEIGHB and the same Value.  The latter SHOULD NOT also
NL_neighbor_addr = lost address exists, then add a Lost Neighbor
Value = LOST
