       Port Randomization in the Network Time Protocol Version 4
                  draft-ietf-ntp-port-randomization-01

Abstract

   The Network Time Protocol can operate in several modes.  Some of
   these modes are based on the receipt of unsolicited packets, and
   therefore require the use of a service/well-known port as the local
   port number.  However, in the case of NTP modes where the use of a
   service/well-known port is not required, employing such well-known/
   service port unnecessarily increases the ability of attackers to
   perform blind/off-path attacks.  This document formally updates
   RFC5905, recommending the use of port randomization for those modes
   where use of the NTP service port is not required.

1.  Introduction

   The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is one of the oldest Internet
   protocols, and currently specified in [RFC5905].  Since its original
   implementation, standardization, and deployment, a number of
   vulnerabilities have been found both in the NTP specification and in
   some of its implementations [NTP-VULN].  Some of these
   vulnerabilities allow for off-path/blind attacks, where an attacker
   can send forged packets to one or both NTP peers for achieving Denial
   of Service (DoS), time-shifts, and other undesirable outcomes.  Many
   of these attacks require the attacker to guess or know at least a
   target NTP association, typically identified by the tuple {srcaddr,
   srcport, dstaddr, dstport, keyid}. Some of these parameters may be
   easily known or guessed.

   NTP can operate in several modes.  Some of these modes rely on the
   ability of nodes to receive unsolicited packets, and therefore
   require the use of a service/well-known port number.  However, for
   modes where the use of a service/well-known port is not required,
   employing such well-known/service port improves the ability of an
   attacker to perform blind/off-path attacks (since knowledge of such

Internet-Draft           NTP Port Randomization               March 2020


   port number is typically required for such attacks).  A recent study
   [NIST-NTP] that analyzes the port numbers employed by NTP clients
   suggests that a considerable number of NTP clients employ the NTP
   service/well-known port as their local port, or select predictable
   ephemeral port numbers, thus improving the ability of attackers to
   perform blind/off-path attacks against NTP.

   BCP 156 [RFC6056] already recommends the randomization of transport-
   protocol ephemeral ports.  This document aligns NTP with the
   recommendation in BCP 156 [RFC6056], by formally updating [RFC5905]
   such that port randomization is employed for those NTP modes for
   which the use of the NTP service port is not required.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Considerations About Port Randomization in NTP

   The following subsections analyze a number of considerations about
   transport-protocol port randomization when applied to NTP.

3.1.  Mitigation Against Off-path Attacks

   There has been a fair share of work in the area of off-path/blind
   attacks against transport protocols and upper-layer protocols, such
   as [RFC5927] and [RFC4953].  Whether the target of the attack is a
   transport protocol instance (e.g., TCP connection) or an upper-layer
   protocol instance (e.g., an application protocol instance), the
   attacker is required to know or guess the five-tuple {Protocol, IP
   Source Address, IP Destination Address, Source Port, Destination
   Port} that identifies the target transport protocol instance or the
   transport protocol instance employed by the target upper-layer
   protocol instance.  Therefore, increasing the difficulty of guessing
   this five-tuple helps mitigate blind/off-path attacks.

   As a result of this considerations, BCP 156 [RFC6056] recommends the
   randomization of transport-protocol ephemeral ports.  And as such,
   this document aims to bring the NTP specification [RFC5905] in line
   with the aforementioned recommendation.

   We note that the use of port randomization is a transport-layer
   mitigation against off-path/blind attacks, and does not preclude (nor
   is it precluded by) other possible mitigations for off-path attacks
   that might be implemented by an application protocol (e.g.
   [I-D.ietf-ntp-data-minimization]).  For instance, some of the



Gont, et al.           Expires September 10, 2020               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft           NTP Port Randomization               March 2020


   aforementioned mitigations may be ineffective against some off-path
   attacks [NTP-FRAG] or may benefit from the additional entropy
   provided by port randomization [NTP-security].

3.2.  Effects on Path Selection

   Intermediate systems implementing the Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP)
   algorithm may select the outgoing link by computing a hash over a
   number of values, that include the transport-protocol source port.
   Thus, as discussed in [NTP-CHLNG], the selected client port may have
   an influence on the measured delay and jitter values.

   This might mean, for example, that two clients in the same network
   synchronized with the same NTP server using a stable source port
   (selected randomly or not) have a significant offset between their
   clocks due to their NTP exchanges taking paths with different
   asymmetry in the network delay.

   If the clients changed their source port with each request, packets
   in different exchanges would take different paths.  The measured
   delay and offset would be less stable, but the offset between the
   clients' clocks would be smaller.  The impact on stability of the
   clocks would be mitigated by the clock filter algorithm, which
   prefers samples with shorter delay.

   On the other hand, if port-randomization is applied on a per-
   association basis, request/responses to the same association would
   likely follow the same path, since the IP addresses and transport
   port numbers employed for an association would not change.  This
   would thus result in more stability of the measurements.

   Section 4 recommends NTP implementations to randomize the ephemeral
   port number of non-symmetrical associations on a per-association
   basis (as opposed to "per-request"), since this is believed to be the
   more conservative approach.  However, implementations may override
   this setting and perform port-randomization on a per-request basis.

3.3.  Filtering of NTP traffic

   In a number of scenarios (such as when mitigating DDoS attacks), a
   network operator may want to differentiate between NTP requests sent
   by clients, and NTP responses sent by NTP servers.  If an
   implementation employs the NTP service port for the client port
   number, requests/responses cannot be readily differentiated by
   inspecting the source and destination port numbers.  Implementation
   of port randomization for non-symmetrical modes allows for simple
   differentiation of NTP requests and responses, and for the

Internet-Draft           NTP Port Randomization               March 2020


   enforcement of security policies that may be valuable for the
   mitigation of DDoS attacks.

3.4.  Effect on NAT devices

   Some NAT devices will not translate the source port of a packet when
   a privileged port number is employed.  In networks where such NAT
   devices are employed, use of the NTP service port for the client port
   will essentially limit the number of hosts that may successfully
   employ NTP client implementations.

   In the case of NAT devices that will translate the source port even
   when a privileged port is employed, packets reaching the external
   realm of the NAT will not employ the NTP service port as the local
   port, since the local port will normally be translated by the NAT
   device possibly, but not necessarily, with a random port.

3.5.  Relation to Other Mitigations for Off-Path Attacks

   Ephemeral Port Randomization is a best current practice (BCP 156)
   that helps mitigate off-path attacks at the transport-layer.  It is
   orthogonal to other possible mitigations for off-path attacks that
   may be implemented at other layers (such as the use of timestamps in
   NTP) which may or may not be effective against some off-path attacks
   (see e.g.  [NTP-FRAG].  This document aligns NTP with the existing
   best current practice on ephemeral port selection, irrespective of
   other techniques that may (and should) be implemented for mitigating
   off-path attacks.

4.  Update to RFC5905

   The following text from Section 9.1 ("Peer Process Variables") of
   [RFC5905]:

      dstport: UDP port number of the client, ordinarily the NTP port
      number PORT (123) assigned by the IANA.  This becomes the source
      port number in packets sent from this association.

   is replaced with:

      dstport: UDP port number of the client.  In the case of broadcast
      server mode (5) and symmetric modes (1 and 2), it SHOULD contain
      the NTP port number PORT (123) assigned by the IANA.  In other
      cases, it SHOULD contain a randomized port number, as specified in
      [RFC6056].  The value in this variable becomes the source port
      number of packets sent from this association.

Internet-Draft           NTP Port Randomization               March 2020


      NOTES:
         When port randomization is employed, the port number SHOULD be
         randomized on a per-association basis.  That is, a random port
         number SHOULD selected when an association is first mobilized,
         and the selected port number is expected to remain constant
         during the life of an association.  An implementation MAY,
         however, override this setting and employ port randomization on
         a per-request basis.

         On most current operating systems, which implement ephemeral
         port randomization [RFC6056], an NTP client may normally rely
         on the operating system to perform port randomization.  For
         example, NTP implementations using POSIX sockets may achieve
         port randomization by *not* binding the socket with the bind()
         function, or binding it to port 0, which has a special meaning
         of "any port". connect()ing the docket will make the port
         inaccessible by other systems (that is, only packets from the
         specified remote socket will be received by the application).

5.  Implementation Status

   [RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication of this
   document as an RFC.]

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   OpenNTPD:
      [OpenNTPD] has never explicitly set the local port of NTP clients,
      and thus employs the ephemeral port selection algorithm
      implemented by the operating system.  Thus, on all operating
      systems that implement port randomization (such as current
      versions of OpenBSD, Linux, and FreeBSD), OpenNTPD will employ
      port randomization for client ports.

   chrony:
      [chrony] by default does not set the local client port, and thus
      employs the ephemeral port selection algorithm implemented by the



Gont, et al.           Expires September 10, 2020               [Page 6]

      operating system.  Thus, on all operating systems that implement
      port randomization (such as current versions of OpenBSD, Linux,
      and FreeBSD), chrony will employ port randomization for client
      ports.

   nwtime.org's sntp client:
      sntp does not explicitly set the local port, and thus employs the
      ephemeral port selection algorithm implemented by the operating
      system.  Thus, on all operating systems that implement port
      randomization (such as current versions of OpenBSD, Linux, and
      FreeBSD), it will employ port randomization for client ports.

6.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA registries within this document.  The RFC-Editor
   can remove this section before publication of this document as an
   RFC.

7.  Security Considerations

   The security implications of predictable numeric identifiers
   [I-D.gont-predictable-numeric-ids] (and of predictable transport-
   protocol port numbers [RFC6056] in particular) have been known for a
   long time now.  However, the NTP specification has traditionally
   followed a pattern of employing common settings and code even when
   not strictly necessary, which at times has resulted in negative
   security and privacy implications (see e.g.
   [I-D.ietf-ntp-data-minimization]).  The use of the NTP service port
   (123) for the srcport and dstport variables is not required for all
   operating modes, and such unnecessary usage comes at the expense of
   reducing the amount of work required for an attacker to successfully
   perform off-path/blind attacks against NTP.  Therefore, this document
   formally updates [RFC5905], recommending the use of transport-
   protocol port randomization when use of the NTP service port is not
   required.

   This issue has been tracked by US-CERT with VU#597821, and has been
   assigned CVE-2019-11331.
