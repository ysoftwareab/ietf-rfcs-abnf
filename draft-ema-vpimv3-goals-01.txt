      1.  Abstract 
       
       
      This document describes the goals of Voice Profile for Internet Mail 
      (VPIM), Version 3 and establishes a baseline of desired 
      functionality against which proposed MIME profiles for Internet 
      voice messaging can be judged. The primary goal for this version is 
      to support interoperability with desktop clients. Other goals for 
      this version of VPIM include backward compatibility, expanded 
      interoperability with unified messaging systems, and conformance to 
      Internet standards. This document does not include goals that were 
      met fully by VPIM version 2 [VPIM2]. 
       
      Different levels of desirability are indicated throughout the 
      document. 
       
       
      2.  Conventions used in this document 
       
       
      Within this document, different levels of desirability for a MIME 
      profile for Internet voice messaging are indicated by different 
      priorities, indicated in {braces}: 
        {1} There is general agreement that this is a critical 
      characteristic of any definition of VPIM version 3. 
       
        {2} Most believe that this is an important characteristic of VPIM 
      version 3.

        {3} There is general belief that this is a useful feature of VPIM 
      version 3, but that other factors might override; a definition that 
      does not provide this element is acceptable. 
       
      In addition, the following terms have specific meaning in this 
      document: 
        "service"      An operational service offered by a service provider 
        "application"  A use of systems to perform a particular function 
        "terminal"     The endpoint of a communication application 
        "goal"         An objective of the standardization process 
       
      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
      this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [REQ]. 
       
       
      3.  Introduction 
       
       
      Until recently, voice mail and call answering services were 
      implemented as stand-alone proprietary systems. Today, standards 
      such as the Voice Profile for Internet Mail (VPIM) enable 
      interoperability between such systems over the Internet. VPIM 
      version 1 [VPIM1] was experimental and was a first attempt at a 
      Voice Profile for Internet Mail, but is now classified as 
      Historical. VPIM Version 2 [VPIM2] is an improvement on VPIM version 
      1 that was originally intended to provide interoperability between 
      voice messaging systems only. It describes a messaging profile that 
      standardizes the exchange of voice mail over an IP messaging network 
      using ESMTP [ESMTP] and MIME [MIME1]. With the trend toward 
      integration of voice mail and email through unified messaging (UM), 
      it is now necessary to define a new version of VPIM that supports 
      the needs of desktop applications and unified messaging systems 
      (including Internet Facsimile [EXFAX]). Because the number of 
      desktop boxes is growing rapidly and will soon approach the number 
      of desktop telephones, it is essential to consider the requirements 
      of desktop email client applications (including, but not limited to, 
      MIME-compliant email clients). 
       
      This document defines the goals for VPIM version 3 [VPIM3 and IVM]. 
      This standard will support the interchange of voice messages between 
      voice mail systems, unified messaging systems, email servers, and 
      desktop client applications. The desktop client applications is of 
      particular and important interest to VPIM version 3. This document 
      will also expand the offerings of service providers by facilitating 
      access to voice mail from a web client.

           Internet Draft              VPIM V3 Goals           March 10, 2000 
       
       
      4.  Goals for Voice Profile for Internet Mail version 3 
       
       
      VPIM must define the MIME profile and discard rules which will be 
      used for the interchange of voice mail messages over the Internet, 
      and must {1} meet the following goals. 
       
       
      4.1  Interoperability 
       
       
      Enhanced interoperability is the primary goal of VPIM version 3. The 
      profile must {1} enable interoperability between voice mail systems, 
      unified messaging systems, Internet email servers, and desktop 
      client applications. Such interoperability will require {1} support 
      for the new media-agnostic systems, which combine multiple media 
      types into a single message, as well as support for legacy voice 
      mail and email systems. It will require {1} features to accommodate 
      varying capabilities of the voice mail, unified messaging and email 
      systems. Furthermore, VPIM version 3 must {1} be compatible with 
      Internet Fax (extended mode) proposed standards and VPIM messages 
      that are fax messages for both sending and receiving. 
       
      To have "interoperability" means that a VPIM version 3 compliant 
      sender attempting to send to a recipient will not fail because of 
      incompatibility. It is essential {1} that VPIM version 3 support 
      interoperability between most of the systems listed below, and 
      desirable {3} to support all of them: 
        - Desktop email client applications 
        - VPIM version 2 and version 3 voice Mail systems 
        - VPIM version 3 unified messaging systems 
        - Traditional email servers 
       
      VPIM version 3 must also {1} include new functionality to facilitate 
      access to voice mail messages from desktop applications. 
       
      Overall interoperability requires interoperability for all of the 
      VPIM elements: critical body parts must {1} be preserved, essential 
      information must be provided in a form that is accessible by the 
      users {1}, status codes must {1} be understood, and operations that 
      are standard for each system should {2} be supported. 
       
       
      4.1.1  Interoperability with Desktop Email Applications 
       
       
      Desktop email applications are typically text based. The ability to 
      listen to, reply to, forward, and generate voice mail messages from 
      a traditional desktop environment is a relatively new development. 
      To accommodate current use and future developments in this area, 
      VPIM version 3 must {1} provide features to support access to voice

           Internet Draft              VPIM V3 Goals           March 10, 2000 
       
      mail messages from the desktop and other email-reading devices. It 
      would also be desirable {3} for it to support web access to voice 
      mail from the desktop. 
       
      VPIM version 3 should not {2} require desktop email applications to 
      possess a large amount of processing power, and a base level 
      implementation must {1} interoperate, even if it does not offer 
      complex processing. There was a strong desire {2} to select a 
      mandatory codec. The mandatory codec would be one that is already 
      widely available on desktops. There was a strong consensus on MSGSM 
      [MSGSM] being the mandatory codec for the interoperability that 
      would therefore be provided. For VPIM version 2 interoperability, 
      {3} there should also be support for the VPIM v2 mandatory codec 
      [ADPCM and G726]. 
       
      Any codecs included in the VPIM version 3 specification should {2} 
      meet the following criteria: 
             - Availability on desktops: Codecs should {2} be available on  
                        most platforms Windows, UNIX, Mac) 
             - Source code availability 
             - Decoding complexity: All codecs must {1} be low complexity  
                        to decode 
             - Encoding complexity: Some of the codecs must {1} be low  
                        complexity to encode.   
             - Bit rate: VPIM version 3 must {1} specify a codec with low  
                        bit rate for devices (i.e., wireless) that do not 
                        have much space/bandwidth. 
             - Voice Over IP support: VPIM version 3 should {2} specify at  
                       least one codec that supports Voice over IP 
                       implementations. 
       
      Most desktop email applications and web clients are not capable of 
      playing raw audio. To support "out-of-the box" playing of voice mail 
      content, VPIM v3 must {1} support wav encapsulation of audio. To 
      enable future support of other formats, VPIM version 3 should {2} 
      provide identification of the codec used without requiring 
      interpretation of an audio format. VPIM v3 may {3} allow audio 
      encodings and formats that are not identified in the VPIM version 3 
      specification to support environments in which the sender is aware 
      of the optimal encoding and format for the recipient. 
       
      Performance and bandwidth issues make it desirable {3} to support 
      streaming of VPIM version 3 audio to the desktop. VPIM version 3 may 
      {3} explicitly support formats other than raw audio and wav to 
      facilitate streaming.  
        
      Because most email readers are text/html based and because many 
      devices are not capable of recording audio content, VPIM v3 must {1} 
      allow inclusion of text body parts in a voice message. VPIM version 
      3 should {2} not explicitly prohibit other media types, as long as  
      critical content is identified and minimal discard rules are 
      specified.

           Internet Draft              VPIM V3 Goals           March 10, 2000 
       
      To support devices that are not capable of playing audio, VPIM 3 
      should {2} define an optional way to describe the content of the 
      message and indicating how the audio content can be accessed. 
       
      It is also a desktop requirement {1} to support attachments of any 
      media type.  
       
       
      4.1.2  Interoperability with VPIM v2 and v3 Voice Messaging Systems 
       
       
      Voice messaging systems are generally implemented as special-purpose 
      machines that interface to a telephone switch and provide call 
      answering and voice messaging services. VPIM version 2 was designed 
      to support interoperability between such systems and remains the 
      best messaging profile for this purpose. 
       
      To support interoperability between VPIM voice messaging systems and 
      other compliant systems, VPIM version 3 should {3} have a simple 
      minimum set of required features that will guarantee 
      interoperability, as well as provision for additional functionality 
      that may be supported by more capable systems. Support for this 
      additional functionality requires {3} a mechanism for identifying 
      essential content and status codes indicating that a message could 
      not be delivered due to capability differences. It should {3} also 
      include a minimum set of discard rules to enable back-down from VPIM 
      V3 to V2. 
       
      Interoperability with VPIM version 2 voice messaging systems is 
      desirable, but not required. Interoperability should {3} be able to 
      depend on the receiving system supporting the VPIM version 2 
      32KADPCM codec [ADPCM and G726] , and should not {3} depend on the 
      receiving system supporting any additional VPIM version 3 codecs or  
      audio formats. 
       
      To ensure interoperability between VPIM version 2 and version 3 
      systems, it may {3} be desirable to revise the VPIM version 2 
      specification to include new status codes and discard rules. 
       
       
      4.1.3  Interoperability with VPIM v3 Unified Messaging Systems 
       
       
      Unified messaging solutions typically leverage common store, 
      directory, and transport layers to provide greater interoperability 
      and accessibility to a variety of media content. They support 
      creation of and access to voicemail, email, and fax messages from a 
      single user interface. 
        
      Most unified messaging systems preserve the notion of a primary 
      media type with multiple message components that convey essential  
       
  
     Di Silvestro, Miles         Expires 10/09/00             [Page 6] 
           Internet Draft              VPIM V3 Goals           March 10, 2000 
       
      information. Because unified messaging clients have varying 
      capabilities, these components may have a different media type than  
      the message. It is also common for unified messaging systems to 
      permit forwarding and replying to messages of one type as an 
      attachment to a message of another type. 
       
      To accommodate the common functionality of unified messaging 
      systems, VPIM version 3 must {1} support the inclusion of body parts 
      of a type other than the primary content type. It must {1} also 
      support the embedding of VPIM messages as attachments to messages of 
      another type (such as multipart/mixed), as well as the embedding of 
      messages of another type as attachments to VPIM messages. 
      Interoperability with fax and fax messages is a must {1}. 
       
      To provide interoperability with systems that cannot handle a 
      particular content type, VPIM version 3 must {1} provide a mechanism 
      for identifying essential or primary body parts and may {3} define 
      media specific status codes and strings to handle non-delivery of 
      these body parts. 
       
       
      4.1.4  Interoperability with Traditional Email Servers 
       
      Traditional email servers are those that support only textual media 
      as inline content. VPIM version 3 must {1} interoperate consistently 
      with the current Internet mail environment. If VPIM version 3 
      messages arrive in users' mailboxes, it is required {1} that the 
      standard interoperate successfully with common user practices for 
      mail messages: storing them in databases, retransmission, 
      forwarding, creation of mail digests, and replying to messages using 
      non-audio equipment. 
       
       
      4.3  Conformance to Existing Standards 
       
       
      It is the goal of VPIM version 3 to conform as closely as possible 
      to existing standards while meeting the other goals defined in this 
      document.  
       
      - Restrictions: The profile should {2} impose as few restrictions as 
      possible to existing Internet mail standards. In particular, it must 
      {1} support all elements of RFC 822 [RFC822] except those that 
      prevent the profile from meeting other VPIM version 3 goals. 
       
      - Additions: The profile should {2} make as few additions as 
      possible to existing internet mail standards. It should also {2} 
      adhere to existing desktop conventions in desktop-related areas such  
      as file extensions. If it is necessary to define new MIME types or 
      sub-types, the VPIM version 3 work group should {2} propose terms  
      that are already standard or in common use in the desktop 
      environment.

      4.4  Backward compatibility 
       
       
      It is a goal of this profile to assure backwards compatibility with 
      VPIM version 2. Where this is not possible, it may be {2} necessary 
      to clarify version 2. VPIM version 2 has already gone through some 
      clarifications to aid in interoperability with version 3. VPIM 
      version 3 should {2} provide and define a minimal set of rules and 
      status codes [CODES] for handling non-delivery of VPIM v3 messages. 
       
       
      4.5  Robustness 
       
       
      VPIM v3 must {1} be usable in an environment in which there exist 
      legacy gateways that do not understand MIME. Core features and 
      critical data must {1} not be lost when messages pass through AMIS 
      gateways [AMIS-A and AMIS-D]. VPIM version 3 should {2} allow 
      interoperability with recipient devices and gateways which have 
      limited buffering capabilities and cannot buffer all header 
      information.
