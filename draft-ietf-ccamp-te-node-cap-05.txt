Abstract

   It is highly desired in several cases, to take into account Traffic
   Engineering (TE) node capabilities during Multi Protocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineered
   Label Switched Path (TE-LSP)  selection, such as for instance the
   capability to act as a branch Label Switching Router (LSR) of a
   Point-To-MultiPoint (P2MP) LSP. This requires advertising these
   capabilities within the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP). For that
   purpose, this document specifies Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and
   Intermediate System-Intermediate System (IS-IS) traffic engineering
   extensions for the advertisement of control plane and data plane
   traffic engineering node capabilities.

1. Terminology

   This document uses terminologies defined in [RFC3031], [RFC3209] and
   [RFC4461].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2. Introduction

   Multi Protocol Label Switching-Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) routing
   ([RFC3784], [RFC3630], [OSPFv3-TE]) relies on extensions to link
   state Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP) ([IS-IS], [RFC1195],
   [RFC2328], [RFC2740]) in order to advertise Traffic Engineering (TE)
   link information used for constraint based routing. Further
   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) related routing extensions are defined in
   [RFC4205] and [RFC4203].

   It is desired to complement these routing extensions in order to
   advertise TE node capabilities, in addition to TE link information.
   These TE node capabilities will be taken into account as constraints
   during path selection.

   Indeed, it is useful to advertise data plane TE node capabilities,
   such as the capability for a Label Switching Router (LSR) to be a
   branch LSR or a bud-LSR of a Point-To-MultiPoint (P2MP) Label
   Switched Path (LSP). These capabilities can then be taken into
   account as constraints when computing the route of TE LSPs.

   It is also useful to advertise control plane TE node capabilities
   such as the capability to support GMPLS signaling for a packet LSR,
   or the capability to support P2MP (Point to Multipoint) TE LSP
   signaling.  This allows selecting a path that avoids nodes that do
   not support a given control plane feature, or triggering a mechanism
   to support such nodes on a path. Hence this facilitates backward
   compatibility.

   For that purpose, this document specifies IGP (OSPF and IS-IS)
   extensions in order to advertise data plane and control plane
   capabilities of a node.

   A new TLV is defined for OSPF, the TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV,
   to be carried within the Router Information LSA ([OSPF-CAP]).
   A new sub-TLV is defined for IS-IS, the TE Node Capability Descriptor
   sub-TLV, to be carried within the IS-IS Capability TLV ([IS-IS-CAP]).

3. TE Node Capability Descriptor

3.1. Description

   LSRs in a network may have distinct control plane and data plane
   Traffic Engineering capabilities. The TE Node Capability Descriptor
   information defined in this document describes data and control plane
   capabilities of an LSR. Such information can be used during path
   computation so as to avoid nodes that do not support a given TE
   feature either in the control or data plane, or to trigger procedures
   to handle these nodes along the path (e.g, trigger LSP hierarchy to
   support a legacy transit LSR on a P2MP LSP (see [RSVP-P2MP])).

3.2. Required Information

   The TE Node Capability Descriptor contains a variable length set of
   bit flags, where each bit corresponds to a given TE node capability.

   Five TE Node Capabilities are defined in this document:

        - B bit: when set, this flag indicates that the LSR can act
                 as a branch node on a P2MP LSP (see [RFC4461]);
        - E bit: when set, this flag indicates that the LSR can act
                 as a bud LSR on a P2MP LSP, i.e. an LSR that is both
                 transit and egress (see [RFC4461]).
        - M bit: when set, this flag indicates that the LSR supports
                 MPLS-TE signaling ([RFC3209]);
        - G bit: when set this flag indicates that the LSR supports
                 GMPLS signaling ([RFC3473]);
        - P bit: when set, this flag indicates that the LSR supports
                 P2MP MPLS-TE signaling ([RSVP-P2MP]).

   Note that new capability bits may be added in the future if required.

4. TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV formats

4.1. OSPF TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV format

   The OSPF TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV is a variable length TLV
   that contains a series of bit flags, where each bit correspond to a
   TE node capability.

   The OSPF TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV is carried within an OSPF
   Router Information LSA which is defined in [OSPF-CAP].

   The format of the OSPF TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV is the same
   as the TLV format used by the Traffic Engineering Extensions to OSPF
   [RFC3630]. That is, the TLV is composed of 2 octets for the type, 2
   octets specifying the length of the value field and a value field.

   The OSPF TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV has the following format:

      TYPE:     Assigned by IANA - see Section 8.1.
      LENGTH:   Variable (multiple of 4).
      VALUE:    Array of units of 32 flags numbered from the most
                significant bit as bit zero, where each bit represents
                a TE node capability.

   The following bits are defined:

     Bit       Capabilities

      0      B bit: P2MP Branch Node capability: When set this indicates
             that the LSR can act as a branch node on a P2MP LSP
             [RFC4461].
      1      E bit: P2MP Bud-LSR capability: When set, this indicates
             that the LSR can act as a bud LSR on a P2MP LSP, i.e. an
             LSR that is both transit and egress [RFC4461].
      2      M bit: If set this indicates that the LSR supports MPLS-TE
             signaling ([RFC3209]).
      3      G bit: If set this indicates that the LSR supports GMPLS
             signaling ([RFC3473]).
      4      P bit: If set this indicates that the LSR supports P2MP
             MPLS-TE signaling ([RSVP-P2MP]).

      5-31   Reserved for future assignments by IANA.

4.2. IS-IS TE Node Capability Descriptor sub-TLV format

   The IS-IS TE Node Capability Descriptor sub-TLV is a variable length
   sub-TLV that contains a series of bit flags, where each bit
   correspond to a TE node capability.

   The IS-IS TE Node Capability Descriptor sub-TLV is carried within an
   IS-IS CAPABILITY TLV which is defined in [IS-IS-CAP].

   The format of the IS-IS TE Node Capability sub-TLV is the same as the
   TLV format used by the Traffic Engineering Extensions to IS-IS
   [RFC3784]. That is, the TLV is composed of 1 octet for the type, 1
   octet specifying the TLV length and a value field.

   The IS-IS TE Node Capability Descriptor sub-TLV has the following
   format:

      TYPE:   Assigned by IANA - see Section 8.2.
      LENGTH: Variable
      VALUE:  Array of units of 8 flags numbered from the most
              significant bit as bit zero, where each bit represents
              a TE node capability.

   The following bits are defined:

     Bit       Capabilities

      0      B bit: P2MP Branch Node capability: When set this indicates
             that the LSR can act as a branch node on a P2MP LSP
             [RFC4461].
      1      E bit: P2MP Bud-LSR capability: When set, this indicates
             that the LSR can act as a bud LSR on a P2MP LSP, i.e. an
             LSR that is both transit and egress [RFC4461].
      2      M bit: If set this indicates that the LSR supports MPLS-TE
             signaling ([RFC3209]).
      3      G bit: If set this indicates that the LSR supports GMPLS
             signaling ([RFC3473]).
      4      P bit: If set this indicates that the LSR supports P2MP
             MPLS-TE signaling ([RSVP-P2MP]).

      5-7    Reserved for future assignments by IANA.

5. Elements of procedure

5.1. OSPF

   The TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV is advertised, within an OSPFv2
   Router Information LSA (Opaque type of 4 and Opaque ID of 0)
   or an OSPFv3 Router Information LSA (function code of 12) which are
   defined in [OSPF-CAP].  As such, elements of procedure are inherited
   from those defined in [RFC2328], [RFC2740], and [OSPF-CAP].

   The TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV advertises capabilities that
   may be taken into account as constraints during path selection. Hence
   its flooding scope is area-local, and it MUST be carried within
   OSPFv2 type 10 Router Information LSA (as defined in [RFC2370]) or an
   OSPFv3 Router Information LSA with the S1 bit set and the S2 bit
   cleared (as defined in [RFC2740]).

   A router MUST originate a new OSPF router information LSA whenever
   the content of the TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV changes or
   whenever required by the regular OSPF procedure (LSA refresh (every
   LSRefreshTime)).

   The TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV is OPTIONAL and MUST NOT appear
   more than once in an OSPF Router Information LSA. If a TE Node
   Capability Descriptor TLV appears more than once in an OSPF Router
   Information LSA, only the first occurrence MUST be processed and
   other MUST be ignored.

   When an OSPF LSA does not contain any TE Node capability Descriptor
   TLV, this means that the TE Capabilities of that LSR are unknown.

   Note that a change in any of these capabilities MAY trigger CSPF
   computation, but MUST NOT trigger normal SPF computation.

   Note also that TE node capabilities are expected to be fairly static.
   They may change as the result of configuration change, or software
   upgrade. This is expected not to appear more than once a day.

Internet Draft   draft-ietf-ccamp-te-node-cap-05.txt          April 2007

5.2. IS-IS

   The TE Node Capability sub-TLV is carried within an IS-IS CAPABILITY
   TLV defined in [IS-IS-CAP]. As such, elements of procedure are
   inherited from those defined in [IS-IS-CAP].

   The TE Node Capability Descriptor sub-TLV advertises capabilities
   that may be taken into account as constraints during path selection.
   Hence its flooding is area-local, and MUST be carried within an IS-IS
   CAPABILITY TLV having the S flag cleared.

   An IS-IS router MUST originate a new IS-IS LSP whenever the content
   of any of the TE Node Capability sub-TLV changes or whenever required
   by the regular IS-IS procedure (LSP refresh).

   The TE Node Capability Descriptor sub-TLV is OPTIONAL and MUST NOT
   appear more than once in an ISIS Router Capability TLV.

   When an IS-IS LSP does not contain any TE Node capability Descriptor
   sub-TLV, this means that the TE Capabilities of that LSR are unknown.

   Note that a change in any of these capabilities MAY trigger CSPF
   computation, but MUST NOT trigger normal SPF computation.

   Note also that TE node capabilities are expected to be fairly static.
   They may change as the result of configuration change, or software
   upgrade. This is expected not to appear more than once a day.

6. Backward Compatibility

   The TE Node Capability Descriptor TLVs defined in this document do
   not introduce any interoperability issue. For OSPF, a router not
   supporting the TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV will just silently
   ignore the TLV as specified in [OSPF-CAP]. For IS-IS a router not
   supporting the TE Node Capability Descriptor sub-TLV will just
   silently ignore the sub-TLV as specified in [IS-IS-CAP].

   When the TE Node capability Descriptor TLV is absent, this means that
   the TE Capabilities of that LSR are unknown.

   The absence of a word of capability flags in OSPF or an octet of
   capability flags in IS-IS means that these capabilities are unknown.

Internet Draft   draft-ietf-ccamp-te-node-cap-05.txt          April 2007

7. Security Considerations

   This document specifies the content of the TE Node Capability
   Descriptor TLV in ISIS and OSPF, to be used for (G)MPLS-TE path
   computation. As this TLV is not used for SPF computation or normal
   routing, the extensions specified here have no direct effect on IP
   routing. Tampering with this TLV may have an effect on Traffic
   Engineering computation. Mechanisms defined to secure ISIS Link State
   PDUs [RFC3567], OSPF LSAs [RFC2154], and their TLVs, can be used to
   secure this TLV as well.

8. IANA considerations

8.1. OSPF TLV

   [OSPF-CAP] defines a new code point registry for TLVs carried in the
   Router Information LSA defined in [OSPF-CAP].

   IANA is requested to make a new codepoint assignment from that
   registry for the TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV defined in this
   document and carried within the Router Information LSA. The value 1
   is suggested. See Section 4.1 of this document.

8.2. ISIS sub-TLV

   [IS-IS-CAP] defines a new code point registry for sub-TLVs carried in
   the ISIS CAPABILITY TLV defined in [IS-IS-CAP].

   IANA is requested to make a new codepoint assignment from that
   registry for the TE Node Capability Descriptor sub-TLV defined in
   this document, and carried within the ISIS CAPABILITY TLV. The value
   1 is suggested. See Section 4.2 of this document.

8.3. Capability Registry

   IANA is requested to create a new registry to manage the space of
   capability bit flags carried within the OSPF and ISIS TE Node
   Capability Descriptor.

   A single registry must be defined for both protocols. It is suggested
   that a new base registry be created to cover IGP-TE registries that
   apply to both OSPF and ISIS, and that the new registry requested by
   this document should be a sub-registry of this new bas registry.

   Bits in the new regstry should be numbered in the usual IETF notation
   starting with the most significant bit as bit zero.

   New bit numbers may be allocated only by an IETF Consensus action.

   Each bit should be tracked with the following qualities:
      - Bit number
      - Defining RFC
      - Name of bit

   IANA is requested to make assignments for the five TE node
   capabilities defined in this document (see Sections 8.1 and 8.2)
   using the following suggested values:

   Bit No.    Name                                   Reference
   --------+---------------------------------------+-----------
      1       B bit: P2MP Branch LSR capability      [This.I-D]
      2       E bit: P2MP Bud LSR capability         [This.I-D]
      3       M bit: MPLS-TE support                 [This.I-D]
      4       G bit: GMPLS support                   [This.I-D]
      5       P bit: P2MP RSVP-TE support            [This.I-D]
