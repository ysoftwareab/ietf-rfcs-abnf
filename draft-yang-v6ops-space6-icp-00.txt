        Service-Provider Application Cloud-based Engine for IPv6
                     draft-yang-v6ops-space6-icp-00

Abstract

   Even though a lot of IPv6 transition solutions have been proposed and
   standardized during the past few years, the migration of ICPs are
   still much slower than expected, there is still a lack of a
   comprehensive transition tool for them.  This document introduces a
   solution to help ICPs expedite their procedures, SPACE6, stands for
   Service-Provider Application Cloud-based Engine for IPv6.

Internet-Draft                 SPACE6-ICP                      June 2011


1.  Introduction

   At present, most ICPs (Internet Content Provider) are providing
   services based on IPv4; they have not begun the migration to IPv6
   indeed, although IANA has announced the depletion of IPv4 addresses.
   In the near future, ISP (Internet Service Provider) will assign IPv6
   addresses to their new subscribers, therefore there will exists both
   IPv4 users and IPv6 users, the network infrastructure and deployment
   scenario will be getting more and more complicated.

   When providing services to the public, ICPs always have to pay more
   attention to the network environment of their potential clients, they
   are facing a very important issue: how to offer the IPv4 and IPv6
   services simultaneously, to be more precise, this means how to
   realize the interoperation between IPv4 and IPv6.  The most ideal
   solution for an ICP is to upgrade the platform to support dual stacks
   from the code level, but the implementations of ICPs' business
   platforms differ in thousands of ways, and the difficulties of
   modification are various, so it's impossible to finish the migration
   to IPv6 in a short period of time.  In these cases, there should be
   some tools or solutions to solve the intercommunication between IPv4
   and IPv6, which would also be of great importance for dealing with
   the lack of IPv6 contents during the early transition stage.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Terminologies

   The following definitions apply for the purposes of this document
   (some definitions are from other RFCs):

   Stateful NAT64:  A function that has per-flow state that translates
               IPv6 packets to IPv4 packets and vice versa, for TCP,
               UDP, and ICMP.  The NAT64 uses binding state to perform
               the translation between IPv6 and IPv4 addresses.  In this
               document, we also refer to stateful NAT64 simply as
               NAT64.

   DNS64:      A logical function that synthesizes DNS resource records
               (e.g., AAAA records containing IPv6 addresses) from DNS
               resource records actually contained in the DNS (e.g., A
               records containing IPv4 addresses).

   Authoritative server:  A DNS server that can answer authoritatively a
               given DNS request.

   IDC:        A place established by a service provider to provide
               stable and wide-band networks and high performance
               computers as a service to their customers

   Client-side solution:  The solution that are operated and maintained
               by the end users.

   ISP network-side solution:  The solution that are deployed in the ISP
               network and maintained by the ISP.

   ICP-side solution:  The solution that are deployed in the ICP network
               and maintained by an specific ICP.

   Subscriber: The client that is purchasing the DSL circuit from the
               Service Provider and is receiving the billing.


3.  Problem Statement

   According to the position of deployment, existing solutions are
   grouped into three categories: Client-side, ISP network-side and ICP-
   side solution.  This article would analyze and compare the pros and
   cons of those mechanisms, and then introduce a new ICP-side solution
   called SPACE6, aim to help ICPs expedite their transition procedures.

   Client-side intercommunication mechanisms are implemented by
   installing and applying the protocol translation module, which would
   modify the socket API or act as a proxy to realize the protocol
   translation automatically.  This group includes BIS [RFC2767] , BIA
   [RFC3338] and so on, they need to be deployed on the client terminal,
   but there are so many clients out there that it's even impossible to
   put them into practices, furthermore those methods are a little
   complicated and inextensible.

   ISP network-side mechanism is that ISPs deploy the translation
   gateway on their network, such as NAT64 and DNS64, providing the
   basic capability for IPv6 clients to access IPv4 service.  These
   solutions are offered to all subscribers, since there are so many
   types of applications, some of which are not working correctly with
   the NAT devices, and the network throughput is far larger than the
   capacity of NAT devices.

   ICP-side mechanisms include that ICP upgrade their whole system to
   provide IPv6 access services, IPv6 clients are likely to access the
   service directly.  The following section focuses on the comparison of

Internet-Draft                 SPACE6-ICP                      June 2011


   ISP network-side and ICP-side mechanisms.

3.1.  NAT64 in ISP

   Stateful NAT64 and DNS64 are described in RFC6146 [RFC6146] and
   RFC6147 [RFC6147] respectively in detail.  For the moment, the
   combination of NAT64 and DNS64 is the most popular solution for the
   intercommunication between IPv6 and IPv4, the best deployment
   position is the border of IPv6 and IPv4 network.  Stateful NAT64 can
   only translate the traffic initiated by IPv6 side, while stateless
   NAT64 can deal with both.  In practice, NAT64 and DNS64 are also used
   in ICP side; in this case, it can only serve the specific ICP within
   its domain.

   When an ISP is deploying NAT64 and DNS64, protocol translation is
   considered as a generic service, which is open to all IPv6
   subscribers and IPv4 ICP, but it only supports a limited number of
   applications.  As an ISP network-side solution, NAT64 and DNS64 have
   the following drawbacks:

   1.  Limited number of applications are supported: NAT64 do not
       analyze the application layer protocols, it only translates the
       IP header and maintains the state of TCP, UDP and ICMP sessions,
       but there are a lot of streaming media applications that based on
       RTP and RTCP as the transport layer protocols, which are not
       supported by NAT64 yet.

   2.  Imperfect support for application: NAT64 do not support HTTP
       perfectly, for example: it required that the URL of hyperlink
       must contain the domain name, rather than an IP address.

   3.  Difficulties of deployment: ISP should deploy and maintain extra
       DNS64 servers, whose stabilities have not been tested for a long
       enough period of time, so it's unacceptable to deploy a number of
       DNS64 servers for commercial business.

   4.  if the client is dual-stack, NAT64 and DNS64 will bring a series
       of problems, since DNS64 would always return answers for AAAA
       query, and client application would prefer IPv6 to initialize the
       communication, this result in dual-stack clients couldn't access
       ICP service via IPv4 directly.

3.2.  NAT64 in ICP

   Most ICP are willing to provide stable and comprehensive IPv6
   services to their clients, thus network-side solutions can't meet
   their requirements.  From the technical aspect, the best way is to
   check and revise the system codes, but the costs are much more than



Yang, et al.            Expires December 12, 2011               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                 SPACE6-ICP                      June 2011


   an ICP can afford, such as the manpower and economy.  Most of them
   are seeking a quick and effective transition solution.

   As mentioned above, ICP can deploy the NAT64 as a gateway in front of
   their IPv4 system, but it also has the following issues:

   1.  if the DNS64 server is operated by an ICP, which means it would
       replace the original authoritative DNS server of that ICP, and
       then IPv6 client could never get the full content of a webpage,
       something on the webpage would not be displayed correctly, this
       phenomenon is called "dormer" problem.  Normally a web page
       contains both interior and exterior hyperlinks; IPv6 browser
       can't get the content of exterior hyperlink if there are no AAAA
       records for that host.

   2.  NAT64 is unaware of the application layer protocols, so if IP
       address is hard-coding in the payload directly, or negotiated
       during the exchange of control signals, in those cases, the IPv6
       client didn't resolve the domain name from the DNS64 server
       first, and the traffic will never go through the NAT64 gateway,
       then it will fail.

   3.  An ICP may provide multiple types of service, some of which are
       not supported by NAT64, such as streaming media and encryption
       with IPsec.

3.3.  Problems Conclusion

   In conclusion, wherever NAT64 and DNS64 are deployed, there are still
   some issues to be solved, in the comparison, we found that ICP-side
   solutions are more focused and are more likely to help ICP migrate to
   IPv6 completely.  The following section will describe the solution -
   SPACE6.  It's a case-by-case solution, which means SPACE6 is designed
   and configured according to a particular ICP's requirements.  SAPCE6
   comes up with the assumption: 80 percents of the Internet traffic
   belong to a specific type of application, and 80 percents of which
   are from and toward the TOP10 ICP in the world.  In fact, based on an
   analysis of real-time traffic of China, we found 60 percents are
   HTTP, and 80 percents of HTTP traffic are generated by TOP10 ICPs.
   Therefore, it's necessary to provide a customized IPv6 transition
   service, in accordance with application types and transition needs.

   Compared with NAT64, SPACE6 solution processes the traffic from both
   applications and network layers; its architecture is as following:

                     Figure 1: Architecture of SPACE6

   SPACE6 consist of two components: SPACE6 Gear and SPACE6 DNS.  Gear
   is in charge of the protocol translation from both application and
   network layers, while SPACE6 DNS is responsible for leading the
   traffic to SPACE6 gear.

   SPACE6 gear is dual-stack, it listens and receives HTTP request from
   IPv6 clients, afterwards it tries to get the contents from the IPv4-
   only ICP based on that request, and finally the contents are modified
   if necessary and returned back to the clients.  The clients will
   never notice any differences with or without these processes, user
   experience wouldn't go down.  Furthermore gear will scan the content
   of IP payload; so it can figure out the hard-coded IP address and any
   other issue that can't be solved by NAT64.  Gear is composed of the

Internet-Draft                 SPACE6-ICP                      June 2011


   following modules:

   1.  Dispatcher is a virtual module, it may be the routing system or
       the embedded netfilter module of Linux, the duty is to identify
       the type of application of the received packets, and dispatch
       them to different ALG modules, for example, HTTP packets are sent
       to HTTP ALG.

   2.  ALG, short for Application Layer Gateway, is a module deals with
       one type of application, realizing some functionalities to help
       the intercommunication.  An ALG is independent with another one;
       SPACE6 is extensible by the installation and removal of another
       ALG module.  ALG can be implemented in many ways, such as a
       proxy, to receive an IPv6 request from the client and to send
       IPv4 request to the real server.

   3.  NLG represents Network Layer Gateway, its functionality is
       similar with NAT64; that is to translate the network layer
       protocols, and NLG supports TCP, UDP and ICMP for the moment.

   NLG and ALG are the core modules, they should work together, in most
   cases, the traffic go through SPACE6 platform are handled by the
   specific ALG, but there would be some ALGs that are not implemented
   yet, in that case, the traffic should be directed to the NLG module,
   for some unsupported transport layer protocols, such as media
   streaming, they should be handled by an ALG.  As it's customized for
   each ICP, SPACE6 would satisfy most ICP service requirement.

   Regarding SPACE6 gear, the most important aspect is that how to let
   the IPv6 traffic accessing an ICP website to go through the SPACE6
   platform, so that the gear can translate them.  One possible way is
   to use a particular IPv6 prefix as NAT64 does, and the authoritative
   DNS has an AAAA record pointing to that address; but for an ALG, the
   only available method is to deploy a DNS server, rather than
   specifying an IP address directly.

   When applying the above method, the following factors must be taken
   into account: (1) The DNS servers that subscribers would use are only
   specified by the ISP, which means it's impossible to use an extra DNS
   server indicated by an third-party organization. (2) ISP's DNS
   servers are complicated and stability-oriented; it is not permitted
   to operate arbitrarily, so the ISPs are not willing to modify their
   existing stable DNS servers. (3) Modification of the authoritative
   DNS of an ICP is relatively easy, but the effective zone is only
   restricted within the domain of that ICP, this is the root cause of
   the problem "dormer".  All of these above problems are concerning
   with the reasonable position of DNS64 deployment.

Internet-Draft                 SPACE6-ICP                      June 2011


   To avoid the aforementioned issues, SPACE6 DNS adopts an special
   implementation, it is an ordinary authoritative DNS server except for
   the additional module called "name modifier".  SPACE6 DNS should work
   together with ALG modules of SPACE6 gear to lead the traffic to
   SPACE6 platform.

   Concretely speaking, SPACE6 DNS receives the AAAA query, revise the
   host name attribute, and then send an A query to the real DNS server
   of an ICP, the ICP need to add a new record pointing at SPACE6
   platform.  When the IPv6 traffic reaches the platform, they are
   translated into IPv4 traffic by the SPACE6 gear; the ALG modules of
   gear can rewrite the hyperlinks to make sure the subsequent DNS query
   are resolved by SPACE6 DNS; such DNS have some records corresponding
   to SPACE6 platform.  SPACE6 DNS is composed of name modifier and name
   resolver; the first component will revise the hostname of a DNS
   query, while the second one synthesizes an AAAA answer responded to
   client.

   Based on the above architecture, SPACE6 is extensible and scalable.
   It's easy to provide new feature by installing a module, each ALG is
   independent with another.

4.2.  Deployment Scenario

   SPACE6 is a transition tool to help ICP migrate to IPv6 in a fast
   way, this solution is customized by each ICP and is deployed in the
   ICP side, it's not necessary to check and recode the whole system.
   What is more, the solution is transparent for the IPv6 subscribers,
   they have nothing to configure, and the client will access the IPv6
   service in the same way as IPv4.  As an enclosed mechanism, SPACE6
   has little impact on the ICP existing network, so it's deployment
   friendly.  Furthermore SPACE6 is built upon cloud computing, it's
   flexible and extensible to support large-scale subscribers
   seamlessly.

   The deployment scenario of SPACE6 is as follow:

                                             +----------------+
                      +---------------+      |                |
    +-------------+   |               |    +--------+   IPv4  |
    | IPv6 Client |---| IPv6 Internet |----| SPACE6 |         |
    +-------------+   |               |    +--------+   IDC   |
                      +---------------+      |                |
                                             +----------------+

                       Figure 2: Deployment Scenario

   It's recommended to deploy SPACE6 on the border of an IPv4-only IDC,

Internet-Draft                 SPACE6-ICP                      June 2011


   the ICP should make sure it has configured an AAAA record in the DNS
   pointing to SPACE6.  Actually SPACE6 look like an IPv6 interface for
   that IPv4-only ICP, it receives the requests from the client, and
   send the response back to them like a real server.

   This draft described a scenario of communication initiated by IPv6
   clients, in fact, as an application layer proxy; SPACE6 can support
   both directions of the intercommunication.  During the early
   transition stage, new IPv6 subscribers would access the IPv4-only
   service, and upon the last stages, remaining IPv4 clients could visit
   the IPv6 contents, this kind of tools are very useful and necessary
   during the transition to IPv6.
