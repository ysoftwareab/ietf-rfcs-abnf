x=1  implies that a mobile network has only a single MR,
         presumably multihomed.

x=n  implies that a mobile network has more than one MR.

y=1  implies that a single HA is assigned to the mobile network.

y=n  implies that multiple HAs are assigned to the mobile network.

z=1  implies that a single MNP is available in the NEMO.

z=N  implies that multiple MNPs are available in the NEMO

x=1: Multihomed mobile networks with a single MR

      o Example 1:

         MR with dual/multiple access interfaces (e.g. 802.11 and GPRS
         capabilities).  This is a (1,1,*) if both accesses are
         performed with the same ISP.  If the two accesses are offered
         by independent ISPs, this is a (1,n,n) configuration.

         Benefits: Ubiquitous Access, Reliability, Load Sharing,
         Preference Settings, Aggregate Bandwidth.

x=N: Multihomed mobile networks with multiple MRs

      o Example 1:

         Train with one MR in each car, all served by the same HA, thus
         a (n,1,*) configuration.  Alternatively, the train company
         might be forced to use different ISPs when the train crosses
         different countries, thus a (n,n,n) configuration.

         Benefits: Ubiquitous Access, Reliability, Load Sharing,
         Aggregate Bandwidth.
      o Example 2:

         W-PAN with a GPRS-enabled phone and a WiFi-enabled PDA.  This
         is a (n,n,n) configuration if the two access technologies are
         subscribed separately.

         Benefits: Ubiquitous Access, Reliability, Preference Settings,
         Aggregate Bandwidth.

y=1: Multihomed mobile networks with a single HA

      o Example:

         Most single ISP cases in above examples.

y=N: Multihomed mobile networks with multiple HAs

      o Example 1:

         Most multiple ISP cases in above examples.


      o Example 2:

         Transatlantic flight with a HA in each continent.  This is a
         (1,n,1) configuration if there is only one MR.

         Benefits: Ubiquitous Access, Reliability, Preference Settings
         (reduced delay, shortest path).

z=1: Multihomed mobile networks with a single MNP

      o Example:

         Most single ISP cases in above examples.

z=N: Multihomed mobile networks with multiple MNPs

      o Example 1:

         Most multiple ISP cases in above examples.


      o Example 2:

         Car with a prefix taken from home (personal traffic is
         transmitted using this prefix and is paid by the owner) and one
         that belongs to the car manufacturer (maintenance traffic is
         paid by the car manufacturer).  This will typically be a
         (1,1,n) or a (1,n,n,) configuration.

         Benefits: Preference Settings
