Abstract

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) defines the Call-Info header
   field.  This header field delivers additional information about the
   originator or recipient of a SIP request.  Information in the
   Call-Info is generally a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), and the
   exact purpose of this URI is described with the "purpose" parameter.
   This document introduces a new purpose parameter value of
   "conf-policy" that can be used by a conference server to indicate to
   a conference participant User Agent (UA) that the URI carried in the

   Call-Info header field is a URI for accessing the conference policy
   of a particular conference.

Internet-Draft     Call-Info Purpose for conf-policy            May 2004


1.  Introduction

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [1] defines the Call-Info
   header field.  The purpose of the Call-Info header field is to
   provide additional information about the caller or callee, depending
   on whether the header is used in a request or a response.  This
   information consists of a URI, and the purpose of this URI is
   described by the "purpose" parameter.  Some parameter values have
   already been defined:

   o  icon, for providing an image suitable for an iconic representation
      of the caller or callee

   o  info, for providing ageneral description of the caller or callee,
      e.g., in the form of a web page

   o  card, for providing contact information, e.g., in the form of a
      business card

   In addition to these purpose values, additional purpose values can be
   registered with IANA.  This document introduces a new purpose
   parameter value of "conf-policy" that is used by a caller or a callee
   to convey a URI where conference policy pertaining to the session can
   be accessed.  The main use case for the "conf-policy" involves a
   conference server indicating the URI of the conference policy [5] of
   a particular conference to a participant User Agent (UA).  This UA
   can then use the Call-Info URI to manipulate the conference policy.

2.  Overview of Operation

   One of the pieces of information carried in the conference state
   event notifications [6] is the conference policy URI [5].
   Participants that subscribe to the conference state event will become
   aware of the conference policy URI, and will therefore be able to
   access it and given appropriate access rights, manipulate it.

   Even in the absence of a conference state event subscription,
   conference participants need to be able to be informed of the
   conference policy URI.  This document describes how the Call-Info
   header field is used to convey the conference policy URI to a SIP UA.
   Certainly other ways to advertise the conference policy URI are
   possible, e.g., through the use of web pages.  However, these
   additional mechanisms are out of the scope of this document.

   There may be several ways in which a conference policy can be
   accessed.  This document defines the Conference Policy Control
   Protocol (CPCP) [4] as the default mechanism for conference policy
   access.  Other mechanisms are allowed but outside the scope of this

   document.

3.  Description of Node Behavior

   To convey the conference policy URI to a conference participant SIP
   UA, the conference focus includes a Call-Info header field with a
   conference policy URI and the "purpose" parameter with a value fo
   "conf-policy" in either the INVITE request, or the 2xx response to an
   INVITE request.  This URI is then used by the participant to
   manipulate the conference policy.

   Implementations that use the "conf-policy" Call-Info purpose MUST
   support CPCP [4] for conference policy control.

   If a User Agent does not support the "conf-policy" purpose, it MUST
   ignore the Call-Info header field.

4.  Augmented BNF Definitions

   This section describes the syntax extensions required for event
   publication in SIP.  The formal syntax definitions described in this
   section are expressed in the Augmented BNF [2] format used in SIP
   [1], and contain references to elements defined therein.

      token  =  "conf-policy" / token

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new "purpose" parameter value of
   "conf-policy" that requires a registration at IANA.  Per the policies
   outlined in [3], the following information is to be added under
   "Header Field Parameters" in
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters:

      Header Field:    Call-Info
      Parameter Name:  purpose
      Reference:       [RFCYYYY]

   (Note to RFC Editor: Replace [RFCYYYY] with the RFC number of this
   document when published.

   OPEN ISSUE: The exact way in which a new reference is added to an
   existing entry is not yet specified in [3]

7.  Security Considerations

   Conference policy as such may be sensitive information, which means
   that delivering any URIs that enable access to it needs to be done
   with security in mind.

   It is RECOMMENDED that proper authentication is performed when access
   to the conference policy is requested.  If the access to the
   conference policy is controlled by the URI itself, e.g., provided by
   a cryptographically random character sequence in the URI, the URI
   SHOULD be sent using integrity protection as defined in [1].
