Internet-Draft    IPv6 RA Option for DNS Configuration     February 2007


1.  Introduction

   Neighbor Discovery (ND) for IP Version 6 and IPv6 Stateless Address
   Autoconfiguration provide ways to configure either fixed or mobile
   nodes with one or more IPv6 addresses, default routes and some other
   parameters [2][3].  To support the access to additional services in
   the Internet that are identified by a DNS name, such as a web server,
   the configuration of at least one recursive DNS server is also needed
   for DNS name resolution.

   It is infeasible for nomadic hosts, such as laptops, to have to enter
   a DNS resolver each time they connect to a different wireless LAN
   (WLAN) such as IEEE 802.11 a/b/g [12]-[15].  This document provides a
   new way which uses a new IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) option to
   allow IPv6 routers to advertise DNS recursive server addresses to
   IPv6 hosts.

1.1.  Applicability Statements

   RA-based DNS configuration is useful in the networks where an IPv6
   host's address is autoconfigured through IPv6 stateless address
   autoconfiguration, such as ISP Networks, Enterprise Networks, 3GPP
   Networks, and Unmanaged Networks [9].  The reason is that neither
   additional mechanism nor protocol is needed.  The advantages and
   disadvantages of the RA-based approach are discussed in [9] along
   with other approaches, such as the DHCP and Well-known anycast
   addresses approaches.

   In some mobile environments (e.g., Mobile IPv6 [10]) where an IPv6
   host's current IP address (e.g., care-of address [10]) is updated
   through RA message according to its movement, the host can get the
   RDNSS addresses in the same RA message.  As a result, the host does
   not need any additional operation and delay for obtaining RDNSS
   addresses through the DHCP [6]-[8].

1.2.  Coexistence of RDNSS Option and DHCP Option

   The RDNSS option and DHCP option can be used together [9].  To order
   the RA and DHCP approaches, the O (Other stateful configuration) flag
   can be used in the RA message [2].  If no RDNSS option is included,
   an IPv6 host may perform DNS configuration through DHCPv6 [6]-[8]
   regardless of whether the O flag is set or not.

   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].


3.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology described in [2] and [3].  In
   addition, four new terms are defined below:

   o  Recursive DNS Server (RDNSS): Server which provides a recursive
      DNS resolution service for translating domain names into IP
      addresses as defined in [4] and [5].

   o  RDNSS Option: IPv6 RA Option to deliver the RDNSS information to
      the IPv6 hosts [2].

   o  DNS Server List: Data structure for managing DNS Server
      Information existing in IPv6 protocol stack in addition to
      Neighbor Cache and Destination Cache for Neighbor Discovery [2].

   o  Resolver Repository: Configuration repository with RDNSS addresses
      which a DNS resolver on the host uses for DNS name resolution,
      such as Unix resolver file (i.e., /etc/resolv.conf) and Windows
      registry.


4.  Overview

   This document defines a new ND option called RDNSS option that
   contains the addresses of recursive DNS servers.  Existing ND
   transport mechanisms (i.e., advertisements and solicitations) are
   used.  This works in the same way that hosts learn about routers and
   prefixes.  An IPv6 host can configure the IPv6 addresses of one or
   more RDNSSes via RA message periodically sent by router or solicited
   by a Router Solicitation (RS).

   Through the RDNSS option along with the prefix information option
   based on the ND protocol ([2] and [3]), an IPv6 host can perform its
   network configuration of its IPv6 address and RDNSS simultaneously
   without needing a separate message exchange for the RDNSS
   information.  The RA option for RDNSS can be used on any network that
   supports the use of ND.

   This approach requires RDNSS information to be configured in the
   routers sending the advertisements.  The configuration of RDNSS
   addresses in the routers can be done by manual configuration.  The
   automatic configuration or redistribution of RDNSS information is
   possible by running a DHCPv6 client running on the router [6]-[8].
   The automatic configuration of RDNSS addresses in the routers is out

   of scope in this document.


5.  Neighbor Discovery Extension

   The IPv6 DNS configuration mechanism in this document needs a new ND
   option in Neighbor Discovery, Recursive DNS Server (RDNSS) option.

5.1.  Recursive DNS Server Option

   RDNSS option contains one or more IPv6 addresses of recursive DNS
   servers.  All of the addresses share the same lifetime value.  If it
   is desirable to have different lifetime values, multiple RDNSS
   options can be used.

   Figure 1 shows the format of RDNSS option.

   Fields:

        Type          8-bit identifier of the option type (TBD: IANA)
                            Option Name               Type
                            RDNSS option              (TBD)

        Length        8-bit unsigned integer.  The length of the
                      option (including the type and length fields)
                      in units of 8 octets.  The minimum value is 0x03
                      if one IPv6 address is contained in the option.
                      Every additional RDNSS address increases the
                      length by 0x02.  The length field is used by
                      the receiver to determine the number of IPv6
                      addresses in the option.

        Lifetime      32-bit unsigned integer.  The maximum time, in
                      seconds (relative to the time the packet is sent),
                      over which this RDNSS MAY be used for name
                      resolution.  Hosts MAY send a Router Solicitation
                      to ensure the RDNSS information is fresh before
                      the interval expires.  In order to provide fixed
                      hosts with the stable DNS service and allow mobile
                      hosts to prefer local RDNSSes to remote RDNSSes,
                      the value of lifetime should be at least as long
                      as the Maximum RA Interval (MaxRtrAdvInterval) in
                      RFC 2461, and be at most as long as two times
                      MaxRtrAdvInterval; Lifetime SHOULD be bounded as
                      follows:
                      MaxRtrAdvInterval<=Lifetime<=2*MaxRtrAdvInterval.
                      A value of all one bits (0xffffffff) represents
                      infinity.  A value of zero means that the RDNSS
                      MUST no longer be used.

        Addresses of IPv6 Recursive DNS Servers
                      One or more 128-bit IPv6 addresses of the
                      recursive DNS servers.  The number of addresses
                      is determined by the Length field.  That is,
                      the number of addresses is equal to
                      (Length - 1) / 2.

5.2.  Procedure of DNS Configuration

   The procedure of DNS configuration through RDNSS option is the same
   as any other ND option [2].

5.2.1.  Procedure in IPv6 Host

   When an IPv6 host receives RDNSS option through RA, it checks whether
   the option is valid;

   o  If the RDNSS option is present, the host SHOULD copy the option's
      value into the DNS Server List and the Resolver Repository as long
      as the value of Length field is greater than or equal to the
      minimum value (0x03).  The host MAY ignore additional RDNSS
      addresses within an RDNSS option and/or additional RDNSS options
      within an RA when it has gathered a sufficient number of RDNSSes.

   o  If the RDNSS option is present but invalid (e.g., it has the
      length less than 0x03), the host SHOULD discard the option.

6.  Implementation Considerations

Note

   This non-normative section gives some hints for implementing the
   processing of RDNSS option in IPv6 host.


   For the configuration and management of RDNSS information, the
   advertised RDNSS addresses can be stored and managed in both the DNS
   Server List and the Resolver Repository.

   In environments where the RDNSS information is stored in user space
   and ND runs in the kernel, it is necessary to synchronize the DNS
   Server List for RDNSSes in kernel space and the Resolver Repository
   in user space.  For the synchronization, the implementation where ND
   works in the kernel should provide the write operation for updating
   RDNSS information from the kernel to the Resolver Repository.  One
   simple approach to perform this is to have a daemon around (or a
   program that is called at the defined intervals) that keeps
   monitoring the lifetime of RDNSSes all the time.  Whenever there is
   an expired entry in the DNS Server List, the daemon can delete the
   corresponding entry from the Resolver Repository.

6.1.  DNS Server List Management

   The kernel or user-space process (depending on where RAs are
   processed) should maintain a data structure called DNS Server List
   which keeps the list of RDNSSes.  Each entry of DNS Server List
   consists of RDNSS address and Expiration-time as follows:

   o  RDNSS address: IPv6 address of Recursive DNS Server which is
      available for recursive DNS resolution service in the network
      advertising the RDNSS option; such a network is called site in
      this document.

   o  Expiration-time: Expiration time field giving the time when this
      entry becomes invalid.  Expiration-time is set to the value of
      Lifetime field of RDNSS option plus the current system time.
      Whenever a new RDNSS option with the same address is received,
      this field is updated to have a new expiration time.  When
      Expiration-time becomes less than the current system time, this
      entry is regared as expired.


Note

   An RDNSS MUST be used only as long as both the RA router lifetime and



Jeong, et al.            Expires August 20, 2007                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    IPv6 RA Option for DNS Configuration     February 2007


   the RDNSS option lifetime have not expired.  The reason is that the
   RDNSS may not be currently reachable or may not provide service to
   the host's current address (e.g., due to the network ingress
   filtering [16][17]).

6.2.  Synchronization between DNS Server List and Resolver Repository

   When an IPv6 host receives the information of multiple RDNSSes within
   a site through an RA message with RDNSS option(s), it stores the
   RDNSS addresses in order into both the DNS Server List and the
   Resolver Repository.  The processing of the RDNSS option included in
   RA message is as follows:

      Step (a): Receive and parse RDNSS option(s).  For the RDNSS
      addresses in each RDNSS option, perform Step (b) through Step (d).
      Note that Step (e) is performed whenever an entry expires in the
      DNS Server List.

      Step (b): For each RDNSS address, check the following: If the
      RDNSS address already exists in the DNS Server List and the RDNSS
      option's "Lifetime" field is set to zero, delete the corresponding
      RDNSS entry from both the DNS Server List and the Resolver
      Repository in order to let the RDNSS be not used any more for
      certain reasons in network management, e.g., the breakdown of the
      RDNSS or a renumbering situation.  The processing of this RDNSS
      address is finished here.  Otherwise, go to Step (c).

      Step (c): For each RDNSS address, if it already exists in the DNS
      Server List, then just update the value of "Expiration-time" field
      to have a new expiration time with the RDNSS option's "Lifetime"
      field and the current system time.  Otherwise, go to Step (d).

      Step (d): For each RDNSS address, if it does not exist in the DNS
      Server List, register the RDNSS address and lifetime with the DNS
      Server List and then insert the RDNSS address in front of the
      Resolver Repository.  In the case where the data structure for the
      DNS Server List is full of RDNSS entries, delete from the DNS
      Server List the entry with the smallest expiration time that will
      expire first.  The corresponding RDNSS address is also deleted
      from the Resolver Repository.

      In the order in the RDNSS option, position the newly added RDNSS
      addresses in the front of the Resolver Repository so that the
      RDNSS addresses may be preferred according to their order in the
      RDNSS option for the DNS name resolution.  The processing of these
      RDNSS addresses is finished here.  Note that, in the case where
      there are several routers advertising RDNSS option(s) in a subnet,
      the RDNSSes announced lately are more preferred.

Internet-Draft    IPv6 RA Option for DNS Configuration     February 2007


      Step (e): Delete each expired entry from DNS Server List and the
      RDNSS address corresponding to the entry from the Resolver
      Repository.


7.  Security Considerations

   The security of RA option for RDNSS might be worse than ND protocol
   security [2].  However, any new vulnerability is not known yet in
   this RA option.  In this context, it can be claimed that the
   vulnerability of ND is not worse and is a subset of the attacks that
   any node attached to a LAN can do independently of ND.  A malicious
   node on a LAN can promiscuously receive packets for any router's MAC
   address and send packets with the router's MAC address as the source
   MAC address in the L2 header.  As a result, the L2 switches send
   packets addressed to the router to the malicious node.  Also, this
   attack can send redirects that tell the hosts to send their traffic
   somewhere else.  The malicious node can send unsolicited RA or NA
   replies, answer RS or NS requests, etc.  Also, an attacker could
   configure a host to send out RA with a fraudulent RDNSS address,
   which is presumably an easier avenue of attack than becoming a rogue
   router and having to process all traffic for the subnet.  It is
   necessary to disable the RA RDNSS option in both routers and clients
   administratively to avoid this problem.  All of this can be done
   independently of implementing ND.  Therefore, it can be claimed that
   the RA option for RDNSS does not add to the vulnerability.

   If Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) protocol is used as the security
   mechanism for ND, all the ND options including RDNSS option are also
   automatically included in the signatures [11], so the RDNSS transport
   is integrity-protected.  However, since any valid SEND node can still
   insert RDNSS options, SEND cannot verify who is or is not authorized
   to send the options.


8.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to assign a new IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Option
   type for the RDNSS option defined in this document.

                 Option Name               Type
                 RDNSS option              (TBD)


   The IANA registry for these options is:
