Abstract

   This document analyses the difference between the signaling overhead
   in single and bulk Binding Update (BU) mechanisms.  The aim of this
   document is to show that the signaling overhead can be reduced quite
   substantially by using the bulk BU mechanism.

2.  Introduction

   The current version of the multiple care-of address draft [3]
   presented in the monami6 group has some support for registering
   multiple care-of addresses (CoAs) with a single Binding Update (BU).
   This is known as bulk registration and it works with the home
   registrations.  The current version, however, does not work correctly
   when the Mobile Node (MN) wants to perform a bulk registration with a
   Correspondent Node (CN) as the CN can't verify the CoAs included in
   the BU.  Also the MN can not detect which CoAs were registered
   correctly and which failed with the current draft [3].

   This draft proposes some changes to the sub-option layouts proposed
   in [3].  The purpose of these changes is to enable bulk registration
   with the Home Agent (HA).  These modified sub-options are used later
   in the draft to illustrate performance gain when using bulk
   registrations instead of multiple binding updates.

   The authors of this document have proposed changes to the option
   layouts on the monami6 mailing list and these new layouts are also
   used in this document.  The purpose of these changes is to simplify
   the implementation and add some missing features.

3.  Terminology

   Binding Unique Identifier (BID)

      The BID option allows the MN to specify the Binding Unique
      Identification number (BID) and possibly the associated CoA which
      should be bound to the MN's Home Address (HoA).

      There can be one or more BID options in the BU when the MN is
      sending BUs to its HA.  If more than one BIDs are included the CoA
      MUST be specified starting from the 2nd BID option.

      Currently there can not be more than one BID options in the BU
      when the MN is sending BUs to CNs.

      The BID option allows the HA and CNs to notify the MN about
      binding failures.  In case of failure, the BID option is included
      with the Binding Acknowledgement (BA) and reason of the error is
      reported in the BID option's Status field.

4.  Protocol Overview

   This draft refines the Bulk Registration behavior described in [3]
   while impacts on the protocol operations are kept minimal.  Due to
   the problematic nature of bulk registrations with the CN, bulk
   registrations are currently supported only with the HA.

5.  Mobile IPv6 Extensions

   This performance analysis uses the following Mobile IPv6 options as
   proposed by the authors on the monami6 mailing list.

5.1.  Binding Unique Identifier sub-option

    0                   1                   2                   3

                                   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                   |   Type = TBD  |     Length    |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |     Binding Unique ID (BID)   |Priority/Status|C|R|  Reserved |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                                                               |
   +                                                               +
   |                                                               |
   +                        Care-of Address                        +
   |                                                               |
   +                                                               +
   |                                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   This option is used by the MN when sending BUs.  If the C flag is set
   the care-of address used for the binding is taken from the Care-of
   Address field, otherwise the source address or the possibly included
   Alternate Care-of Address option (ACoA) is used with the binding.

   It should be noted that the MN can specify one or more Binding Unique
   Identifier sub-options in a single BU.  Multiple ACoA options SHOULD
   NOT be included in the BU message to avoid possible problems with
   legacy RFC3775 [2] HAs.

   As bulk registration issues with the CN are not yet solved, there
   MUST NOT be more than one BID option in the BU when the MN is sending
   BUs to CNs.

   This option is also used by HA and CN when sending BAs to tell the MN
   which BIDs were successfully processed.

   The R flag is used with de-registration and is not used in this
   analysis.

   This option has alignment requirement of 2n if the C flag in unset
   and 8n+2 if the C flag is set.

6.  MN <-> HA

   The following two examples show how the packets look like when the MN
   is sending either a single BID or multiple BIDs inside a single BU.
   It is assumed here that all bindings were successfully registered so
   there is no need to include the BID option with BAs.

8.  Conclusions

   The amount of data to transfer (over possibly slow radio links) can
   be dramatically reduced with the bulk registration.  Even with the
   simplest case where the MN wants to register only two CoA with its HA
   the amount of data to be sent between the MN and HA can be reduced by
   45%.
