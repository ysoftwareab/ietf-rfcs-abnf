     MUD processing and extensions for Secure Home Gateway Project
            draft-richardson-opsawg-securehomegateway-mud-01

Abstract

   This document details the mechanism used by the CIRA Secure Home
   Gateway and CIRA MUD integration server to return MUD artifacts to
   participating gateway systems.

   The work in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-mud] creates a relationship between a
   device's manufacturer and a border gateway that may need to enforce
   policy.  This document ads an additional relationship to a service
   provider, trusted by the border gateway to enhance or modify the
   stated security policy.

1.  Introduction

   This document details how the CIRALabs Secure Home Gateway uses MUD
   files.

   [I-D.richardson-shg-mud-quarantined-access] details an extension to
   mark certain ACLs as providing firmware update access.

   The second issue addressed by the document is the question of whether
   and when the MUD file should be specific to a specific version of the
   device firmware.

   The third issue is that an intermediary (ISP, or third-party security
   service) may want to extend or amend a MUD file received from a
   manufacturer.  In order to maintain an audit trail of changes, a way
   to encode the previous MUD URL and signature file (and status) is
   provided.

2.  Terminology

   The major new term, compared to the MUD document is the term

   quaranteed:  a device which has shown behaviour forbidden by a MUD
      file ACL, and has subsequently been denied further access to the
      network.
