INTERNET-DRAFT         The Use of SEED with IPSec          February 2005


1. Introduction

1.1 SEED

   SEED is a national industrial association standard [TTASSEED] and is
   widely used in South Korea for electronic commerce and financial
   services operated on wired & wireless communications.

   SEED is a 128-bit symmetric key block cipher that has been developed
   by KISA (Korea Information Security Agency) and a group of experts
   since 1998.  The input/output block size of SEED is 128-bit and the
   key length is also 128-bit. SEED has the 16-round Feistel structure.
   A 128-bit input is divided into two 64-bit blocks and the right
   64-bit block is an input to the round function with a 64-bit subkey
   generated from the key scheduling.

   SEED is easily implemented in various software and hardware and it
   can be effectively adopted to a computing environment with a
   restricted resources such as mobile devices, smart cards and so on.

   SEED is robust against known attacks including DC (Differential
   cryptanalysis), LC (Linear cryptanalysis), and related key attacks.
   SEED has gone through wide public scrutinizing procedures. It has
   been evaluated and is considered cryptographically secure by credible
   organizations such as ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 and Japan CRYPTREC
   (Cryptography Research and Evaluation Committees)[ISOSEED][CRYPTREC].

   The remainder of this document specifies the use of SEED within the
   context of IPsec ESP.  For further information on how the various
   pieces of ESP fit together to provide security services, please refer
   to [ARCH], [ESP], and [ROAD].

1.2 Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document (in uppercase,
   as shown) are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119.

2. The SEED Cipher Algorithm

   All symmetric block cipher algorithms share common characteristics
   and variables, including mode, key size, weak keys, block size, and
   rounds.  The following sections contain descriptions of the relevant
   characteristics of SEED.

   The algorithm specification and object identifiers are described in
   [ISOSEED, SEED]. The SEED homepage,
   http://www.kisa.or.kr/seed/seed_eng.html, contains a wealth of

   information about SEED, including detailed specification, evaluation
   report, test vectors, and so on.

2.1 Mode

   NIST has defined 5 modes of operation for AES and other FIPS-approved
   ciphers [MODES]: CBC (Cipher Block Chaining), ECB (Electronic
   Codebook), CFB (Cipher FeedBack), OFB (Output FeedBack) and CTR
   (Counter).  The CBC mode is well-defined and well-understood for
   symmetric ciphers, and is currently required for all other ESP
   ciphers.  This document specifies the use of the SEED cipher in CBC
   mode within ESP.  This mode requires an Initialization Vector (IV)
   that is the same size as the block size.  Use of a randomly generated
   IV prevents generation of identical ciphertext from packets which
   have identical data that spans the first block of the cipher
   algorithm's block size

   The IV is XOR'd with the first plaintext block before it is
   encrypted.  Then for successive blocks, the previous ciphertext block
   is XOR'd with the current plaintext, before it is encrypted.

   More information on CBC mode can be obtained in [MODES, CRYPTO-S].
   For the use of CBC mode in ESP with 64-bit ciphers, please see [CBC].

2.2 Key Size and Numbers of Rounds

   SEED supports 128-bit key and has the 16-round Feistel structure.

2.3 Weak Keys

   At the time of writing this document there are no known weak keys for
   SEED.

2.4 Block Size and Padding

   SEED uses a block size of sixteen octets (128 bits).

   Padding is required by the SEED to maintain a 16-octet (128-bit)
   blocksize.  Padding MUST be added, as specified in [ESP], such that
   the data to be encrypted (which includes the ESP Pad Length and Next
   Header fields) has a length that is a multiple of 16 octets.

   Because of the algorithm specific padding requirement, no additional
   padding is required to ensure that the ciphertext terminates on a
   4-octet boundary (i.e. maintaining a 16-octet blocksize guarantee
   that the ESP Pad Length and Next Header fields will be right aligned
   within a 4-octet word). Additional padding MAY be included, as
   specified in [ESP], as long as the 16-octet blocksize is maintained.

2.5 Performance

   Performance figures of SEED are available at
   http://www.kisa.or.kr/seed/seed_eng.html

3. ESP Payload

   The ESP Payload is made up of the Initialization Vector(IV) of 16
   octets followed by encrypted payload. Thus the payload field, as
   define in [ESP], is broken down according to the following diagram :

   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   |                                                               |
   +               Initialization Vector (16 octets)               +
   |                                                               |
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   |                                                               |
   ~ Encrypted Payload (variable length, a multiple of 16 octets)  ~
   |                                                               |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

   The IV field MUST be the same size as the block size of the cipher
   algorithm being used.  The IV MUST be chosen at random, and MUST be
   unpredictable.

   Including the IV in each datagram ensures that decryption of each
   received datagram can be performed, even when some datagrams are
   dropped, or datagrams are re-ordered in transit.

   To avoid CBC encryption of very similar plaintext blocks in different
   packets, implementations MUST NOT use a counter or other low-Hamming
   distance source for IVs.

4. Test Vectors

   The first 2 test cases test SEED-CBC encryption. Each test case
   includes key, the plaintext, and the resulting ciphertext.  All data
   are hexadecimal numbers(not prefixed by "0x").

   The last 4 test cases illustrate sample ESP packets using SEED-CBC
   for encryption. All data are hexadecimal numbers(not prefixed by
   "0x").

   kisa(200004) algorithm(1) }

   id-seedCBC OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { algorithm seedCBC(4) }

5.2 Phase 2 Identifier

   For Phase 2 negotiations, IANA has assigned an ESP Transform
   Identifier of (TBD) for ESP_SEED_CBC.

5.3 Key Length Attribute

   Since the SEED supports 128 bit key lengths, the Key Length attribute
   is set with 128 bits.

5.4 Hash Algorithm Considerations

   HMAC-SHA-1[HMAC-SHA] and HMAC-MD5 [HMAC-MD5] are currently considered
   of sufficient strength to serve both as IKE generators of 128-bit
   SEED keys and as ESP authenticators for SEED encryption using 128-bit
   keys.

6. Security Considerations

   No security problem has been found on SEED. SEED is secure against
   all known attacks including Differential cryptanalysis, Linear
   cryptanalysis and related key attacks, etc. The best known attack is
   only exhaustive search for the key (by [CRYPTREC]). For further
   security considerations,  the reader is encouraged to read
   [CRYPTREC], [ISOSEED] and [SEED-EVAL].

7. IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned ESP Transform Identifier (TBD) to ESP_SEED_CBC.
