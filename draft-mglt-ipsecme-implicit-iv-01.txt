             Implicit IV for Counter-based Ciphers in IPsec
                 draft-mglt-ipsecme-implicit-iv-01.txt

Abstract

   IPsec ESP sends an initialization vector (IV) or nonce in each
   packet, adding 8 or 16 octets.  Some algorithms such as AES-GCM, AES-
   CCM, AES-CTR and ChaCha20-Poly1305 require a unique nonce but do not
   require an unpredictable nonce.  When using such algorithms the
   packet counter value can be used to generate a nonce, saving 8 octets
   per packet.  This document describes how to do this.

1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   Counter-based AES modes of operation such as AES-CTR ([RFC3686]),
   AES-CCM ([RFC4309]), and AES-GCM ([RFC4106]) require the
   specification of an nonce for each ESP packet.  The same applies for
   ChaCha20-Poly1305 ([RFC7634].  Currently this nonce is sent in each
   ESP packet ([RFC4303]).  This practice is designated in this document
   as "explicit nonce".

   In some context, such as IoT, it may be preferable to avoid carrying
   the extra bytes associated to the IV and instead generate it locally
   on each peer.  The local generation of the nonce is designated in
   this document as "implicit IV".

   The size of this nonce depends on the specific algorithm, but all of
   the algorithms mentioned above take an 8-octet nonce.

   This document defines how to compute the nonce locally when it is
   implicit.  It also specifies how peers agree with the Internet Key
   Exchange version 2 (IKEv2 - [RFC7296]) on using an implicit IV versus
   an explicit IV.

Internet-Draft                 Implicit IV                  October 2016


   This document limits its scope to the algorithms mentioned above.
   Other algorithms with similar properties may later be defined to use
   this extension.

   This document does not consider AES-CBC ([RFC3602])as AES-CBC
   requires the IV to be unpredictable.  Deriving it directly from the
   packet counter as described below is insecure.

3.  Terminology

   o  IoT: Internet of Things

   o  IV: Initialization Vector.  Although security requirements vary,
      the common usage of this term implies that the value is
      unpredictable.

   o  Nonce: a fixed-size octet string used only once.  This is similar
      to IV, except that in common usage there is no implication of non-
      predictability.

4.  Implicit IV

   With the algorithms listed in Section 2, the 8 byte nonce MUST NOT
   repeat.  The binding between a ESP packet and its nonce is provided
   using the Sequence Number or the Extended Sequence Number.  Figure 1
   and Figure 2 represent the IV with a regular 4-byte Sequence Number
   and with an 8-byte Extended Sequence Number respectively.

   o  Extended Sequence Number: the 8 byte Extended Sequence Number of
      the Security Association.  The 4 byte low order bytes are carried
      in the ESP packet.

5.  Initiator Behavior

   An initiator supporting this feature SHOULD propose implicit IV for
   all relevant algorithms.  To facilitate backward compatibility with
   non-supporting peers the initiator SHOULD also include those same
   algorithms without IIV.  This may require extra transforms.

6.  Responder Behavior

   The rules of SA payload processing ensure that the responder will
   never send an SA payload containing the IIV indicator to an initiator
   that does not support IIV.

7.  Security Consideration

   Nonce generation for these algorithms has not been explicitly
   defined.  It has been left to the implementation as long as certain
   security requirements are met.  This document provides an explicit
   and normative way to generate IVs.  The mechanism described in this
   document meets the IV security requirements of all relevant
   algorithms.

8.  IANA Considerations

   AES-CTR, AES-CCM, AES-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305 are likely to
   implement the implicit IV described in this document.  This section
   limits assignment of new code points to the recommended suites
   provided in [I-D.ietf-ipsecme-rfc4307bis] and
   [I-D.mglt-ipsecme-rfc7321bis], thus the new Transform Type 1 -
   Encryption Algorithm Transform IDs are as defined below:

   -  ENCR_AES-CCM_8_IIV

   -  ENCR_AES-GCM_16_IIV
