3GPP Access Traffic Steering Switching and Splitting (ATSSS) - Overview
                         for IETF Participants
                draft-bonaventure-quic-atsss-overview-00

Abstract

   This document briefly presents the Access Traffic Steering,
   Switching, and Splitting (ATSSS) service being specified within the
   3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).  The ATSSS service
   provides network support for multihomed devices to select a path for
   transmission (steer), move traffic from one path to another (switch),
   or use multiple paths simultaneously (split).  TS 23.501 specifies an
   ATSSS architecture for TCP traffic.

   This document presents a snap-shot of the ongoing discussion in the
   3GPP to enable ATSSS for non-TCP traffic, based on the use of QUIC,
   and assesses to what extent IETF specifications can be used to meet
   the ATSSS design goals.  Apparent gaps are also documented.

1.  Introduction

   The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has described the
   Access Traffic Steering, Switching, and Splitting (ATSSS) service,
   used to carry traffic over multiple available paths.  In Release 16
   [TS23501], ATSSS supports TCP traffic relying upon two IETF
   protocols: MPTCP [RFC6824] and Convert Protocol
   [I-D.ietf-tcpm-converters].

   As part of preparation for Release 17 studies, 3GPP has expressed an
   interest in other IETF protocols and protocol extensions that would
   enable ATSSS service of traffic not supported by the Convert Protocol
   nor based on the use of MPTCP.  To that aim, 3GPP has contacted the
   IETF through a formal liaison [atsssliaison], letting the IETF know
   about this interest.  An excerpt of the liaison document is provided
   below:

   "The work on the study has not yet started in 3GPP, and there are
   thus no agreed conclusions.  The goal is to enable steering,
   switching and splitting of traffic (primarily UDP) across multiple
   accesses, including latency sensitive and real time traffic.
   Therefore 3GPP is interested to receive regular feedback on progress
   and prioritization on the multipath extensions to QUIC."

   Because "3GPP SA kindly requests IETF to take the above information
   into account when discussing future work in prioritizing the
   multipath work for QUIC", but the complete specification of ATSSS in
   the relevant 3GPP architecture documents reflects the complexity of
   3GPP networks, the authors of this document worked to provide a high
   level overview of the parts of ATSSS that would be impacted by IETF

   protocol design, in terminology that is more familiar to IETF
   participants.

1.1.  Notes for Readers

   We provide a high-level overview of ATSSS in Section 5, describe the
   current ATSSS version in Section 7, describe our thoughts about a
   QUIC-based version of ATSSS in Section 7.1, and conclude with our
   understanding of the gaps between QUIC version 1 and what a QUIC-
   based version of ATSSS will require in Section 8.

   This document is an informational Internet-Draft from individuals,
   and does not carry any special status within the IETF.

   This document abstracts considerable architectural detail that is
   available in 3GPP specifications.  The goal is to make this overview
   more accessible for IETF readers who are not familiar with 3GPP 5G
   architecture.

   This document makes references to Internet-Drafts that are not as
   mature as the core QUIC Internet-Drafts, and in some cases, have not
   been adopted as Working Group drafts yet, although all are within
   existing and proposed IETF working group charters.  The goal is to
   give 3GPP readers the most up-to-date understanding of what is
   possible.

2.  Introduction to Access Traffic Steering, Switching, and Splitting
    (ATSSS)

   Mobile devices such as laptops, smartphones, tablets support multiple
   network interfaces that may attach to different networks.  Over the
   years, various techniques have been proposed to support such multi-
   interfaced devices (e.g., Shim6 [RFC5533], Mobile IPv6 [RFC6275],
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213], or Multipath TCP [RFC6824]).

   Users of these devices have different expectations concerning the
   utilization of available network connectivity (and thus their
   different network interfaces).  For simplicity, we consider a
   smartphone that is equipped with a Wireless LAN (WLAN) interface and
   a cellular interface, but the discussion below can be generalized to
   any device with multiple network interfaces that support IP.

   Some users of these smartphones want to offload most or all of their
   traffic onto the WLAN when the WLAN is available while expecting
   seamless handovers when it is not available.  For example, when they
   move out of the reach of their home WLAN, they expect that the
   established flows (e.g., TCP connections, UDP flows) will continue
   over the cellular interface without any interruption (called "session

   continuity" in 3GPP).  As the devices are assigned different IP
   addresses over WLAN and the cellular networks, this seamless handover
   requires some specific assistance from the network.  The current
   utilization of Multipath TCP on Apple smartphones is an example of
   this use case [IETFJ16].

   Other users want to load balance their flows over the different
   available networks, e.g., by sending a delay-sensitive flow over
   cellular and a long download over the WLAN network.  Several
   smartphones enable applications to indicate their preferences when
   using available networks.  This steering policy can be managed by the
   smartphone, but flows need to continue after a handover.

   Still other users may want to combine the resources provided by the
   cellular and the WLAN networks to improve the up and download
   throughput performance of individual flows.  The GiGA LTE and GiGA 5G
   services deployed using Multipath TCP in South Korea are examples of
   this use case [IETFJ16].

   To support these different use cases in 5G networks, 3GPP is defining
   the Access Traffic Steering, Switching and Splitting (ATSSS) service
   [TS23501].  This work is further adopted by the Broadband Forum to
   provide similar capabilities to residential gateways equipped with
   multiple access interfaces, in the continuity of the Hybrid Access
   Networks [TR-348].

   In this document, we abstract many of the technical details of future
   5G networks to explain the capabilities ATSSS needs, which may impact
   decisions about future work on IETF protocols.

4.  Conventions, Terminology, and Definitions

   This document makes use of 3GPP specific terms defined in [RFC6459],
   mainly the following ones:

   o  Packet Data Network (PDN): is a packet-based network that either
      belongs to the operator or is external (such as the Internet or a
      corporate intranet).  The user eventually accesses services in one
      or more PDNs.  The operator's packet core networks are separated
      from packet data networks by User Plane Functions (UPFs).

   o  UE (User Equipment): refers to the devices that are hosts with the
      ability to obtain Internet connectivity via a 3GPP network.

   o  User Plane: refers to data traffic and the required sessions for
      the data traffic.  In practice, IP is the only data traffic
      protocol used in the user plane.

   Also, the document uses the following additional terms:

   o  Protocol Data Unit (PDU) Session: An association between the UE
      and the Data Network (DN) to carry the user data/traffic.

   o  PDU Connectivity Service: A service that provides exchange of PDUs
      between an UE and a Data Network.

   o  Multi-access PDU (MA-PDU) Session: A PDU session that has
      simultaneously user plane resources assigned on 3GPP and non-3GPP
      access networks.

   o  User Plane Function (UPF): A logical function in the 5G core
      network that provides the interconnect point between the mobile
      infrastructure and the Data Network (DN) and anchor point for
      Protocol Data Unit (PDU) Sessions to enable mobility.

   o  Data Network Name (DNN): is a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
      and resolves to a set of gateways in an operator's network.  DNN
      is used for the selection of the UPF(s) for a PDU Session.

   o  5G Core (5GC) network: Refers to the part of the 5G System which
      is independent of the access technology used by an UE (e.g.,
      cellular, WLAN) [TS23501].  A 5G Core network can be reached via
      one or more access networks.

   o  3GPP access network: Refers to a radio access network used by an
      UE to reach a 5G Core network.  In such case, the UE uses an
      access technology that is specified by 3GPP.

Internet-Draft                 QUIC ATSSS                       May 2020


   o  Non-3GPP access network: Refers to an access network (e.g., WLAN)
      that is not a 3GPP access network and which is used by an UE to
      connect to a 5G Core network.

   o  5G control plane: Denotes the 5G control management component of
      use plane resources (e.g., forwarding policies).

5.  High Level ATSSS Overview

   The 5G Core supports a service that provides exchange of data between
   a User Equipment (UE) and a data network (referred to as Packet Data
   Network (PDN)) identified by a Data Network Name (DNN).  This
   connectivity service, called the Protocol Data Unit (PDU)
   Connectivity Service, is realized via 'PDU Sessions' that are
   established upon request from User Equipment (UE) when the UE first
   connects to that network.  The type of PDU Session can be IPv4, IPv6,
   IPv4v6, Ethernet or Unstructured.

   It is out of the scope of this document to provide a comprehensive
   overview of 5G System (5GS) architecture.  In particular, this
   document does not describe how PDU Sessions are established, and thus
   how IP addresses/prefixes are assigned to requesting UEs.

   An UE can be provided a multi-access PDU Connectivity Service.  That
   is, an UE can exchange data with a PDN by using a "3GPP access
   network" and a "non-3GPP access network" (often a WLAN).  This is
   realized using the ATSSS service that is provided in the 5G core
   network control plane and user plane.  The user plane part of the
   ATSSS functionality is contained in the User Plane Function (UPF)
   that manages the UE's PDU session.

5.1.  Reference Architecture

   To understand the operation of the ATSSS service, it is useful to
   consider the reference environment shown in Figure 1.  An UE is
   attached to two different access networks (Access Net A and Access
   Net B).  Each of these two networks is potentially shared with other
   users, so the bandwidth available from each network varies over time.
   These fluctuations in bandwidth are managed by using congestion
   control schemes.

   One of these access networks is managed by a 5G provider according to
   the 3GPP specifications.  The second network is potentially managed
   by a different organization.  It is important to note that in this
   second case, there is an IPSec tunnel between the UE and a dedicated
   device in the 5G network (not shown in Figure 1).  A dedicated IP
   address is assigned by means of Internet Key Exchange version 2
   (IKEv2) to the UE to access the 5G Core via this second network.

   The UE interacts with a distant server through a User Plane Function
   hosting the ATSSS functionality.  This UPF is called hereafter ATSSS
   UPF.  The ATSSS UPF enables the UE to use a transport protocol that
   supports the different access networks even if the server does not
   support it (i.e., does not use a multipath-capable transport
   protocol).

   The 5G control plane provides the UE and the ATSSS UPF with rules as
   discussed in Section 5.4.  Note that, as per 3GPP definition, the
   rules provided to the UE are called ATSSS Rules, while the ATSSS
   information provided to the UPF is carried via Multi-Access Rules,
   but for simplicity this document uses the term "ATSSS rules" for the
   ATSSS information provided to both UE and UPF.

5.2.  External IP Addresses Used by the ATSSS UPF

   Depending on the ATSSS mode, the ATSSS UPF may translate the access
   network specific addresses into an address called the Multi-Access
   (MA) IP address and vice versa.  Such an address is also directly
   assigned to the UE (that is, packets that are not eligible for the
   ATSSS service are sourced by the UE with that IP address).

   Absent any coordination between the UE and the ATSSS UPF (e.g.,
   assignment of port ranges), the same IP address and port number could

   be used simultaneously by the ATSSS UPF and the UE; which is
   problematic.

   To avoid such issue, the ATSSS UPF may be configured with a pool of
   IP addresses that it can use in the Internet-facing interfaces
   instead of preserving the MA IP address assigned to the UE.  How that
   pool is used is deployment- and implementation-specific.

5.3.  ATSSS Modes

   3GPP defines the following procedures [TS23501] that are applicable
   between "3GPP access" and "non-3GPP access" networks:

   o  Access Traffic Steering: selection of an access network for a new
      data flow and the transfer of the traffic of that data flow over
      the selected access network.

   o  Access Traffic Switching: migration of all packets of an ongoing
      data flow from one access network to another access network.  Only
      one access network is in use at a time, but this still ensures
      session continuity.

   o  Access Traffic Splitting: forwarding the packets of a data flow
      across multiple access networks simultaneously.

   Techniques to provide ATSSS are classified by the 3GPP into two
   flavors: (1) higher-layer techniques which operate above the IP layer
   (e.g., MPTCP), and (2) lower-layer techniques which operate below the
   IP layer.

5.4.  ATSSS Rules

   The 5G control plane provides the UE and the ATSSS UPF with rules
   that specify which flows are eligible to the ATSSS service (i.e., by
   mapping them to a Multi-Access PDU Session).  Once a Multi-Access PDU
   Session has been established, a set of rules are then delivered to
   both the UE and the ATSSS UPF in order to enable consistent treatment
   of the flows by both the UE and the ATSSS UPF within the Session.

   The traffic that matches an ATSSS rule can be distributed among the
   available access networks following one of these modes:

   o  "Active-Standby": The traffic associated with the matching flow
      will be forwarded via a specific access (called 'active access')
      and switched to another access (called 'standby access') when the
      active access is unavailable.

Internet-Draft                 QUIC ATSSS                       May 2020


   o  "Smallest Delay": The traffic associated with the matching flow
      will be forwarded via the access that presents the smallest RTT.
      To that aim, specific measurements are conducted by the UE and a
      dedicated function co-located with the ATSSS UPF.

   o  "Load-Balancing": The traffic associated with the matching flow
      will be distributed among the available access networks following
      a distribution ratio (e.g., 30% via a first access, 70% via a
      second access).

   o  "Priority-based": For this mode, accesses are assigned priority
      levels that indicate which access to be used first.  Concretely,
      the traffic associated with the matching flow will be steered on
      the access with a high priority till congestion is detected, then
      the overflow will be forwarded over a low priority access.

   In order to provide the above-mentioned steering modes, measurement
   information about the current network state of each path is needed.
   Often if a multipath capable protocol is used, the measurements are
   available as part of the protocol itself.  For ATSSS approaches where
   this is not the case, a dedicated protocol called Performance
   Measurement Function (PMF) protocol can be used.  This protocol is
   enabled between the UE and the UPF in order to provide RTT
   measurements and report access availability/unavailability by the UE
   to the UPF.

   These modes of operations can be met by using multipath protocols
   such as MPTCP [RFC6824] to select the different paths between the UE
   and the ATSSS.  Such protocols usually include two types of
   mechanisms to control the utilization of the paths: (i) a path
   manager and (ii) a packet scheduler [RFC8041].  The path manager
   decides when a new subflow needs to be established over a path while
   the packet scheduler selects the subflow over which the next packet
   will be sent.  A more detailed description of several packet
   schedulers may be found in [I-D.bonaventure-iccrg-schedulers].

   The "Active-Standby" mode can be implemented using a path manager
   that tries to use the active access and switches to the standby one
   after a certain number of retransmissions.  This mode of operation is
   similar to the utilization of Multipath TCP on iOS smartphones
   [RFC8041].

   The "Smallest Delay" mode can be implemented using a path manager
   that establishes a subflow over both paths and a packet scheduler
   that measures their RTTs and prefers the one having the lowest RTT.
   These path manager and scheduler are similar to those used by
   Multipath TCP on Linux [RFC8041].

Internet-Draft                 QUIC ATSSS                       May 2020


   The "Load-Balancing" mode would use the same path manager with a
   weighted round-robin scheduler.

   The "Priority-based" mode can be implemented using a path manager
   that is similar to the one used by the "Active-Standby" one, but
   which reacts faster and a packet scheduler that prefers the high
   priority path.  These path manager and scheduler are similar to the
   ones used in deployed Hybrid Access networks [Hybrid].

6.  ATSSS Phases

   We first describe in Section 7 ATSSS as specified in Release 16
   (called hereafter, ATSSS Phase 1) that uses Multipath TCP [RFC6824]
   and the 0-RTT Convert Protocol [I-D.ietf-tcpm-converters] to handle
   TCP traffic.  We then discuss in Section 7.1 the data plane
   requirements for Phase 2 of the ATSSS specification that 3GPP plans
   for Release 17.  More details about 3GPP releases can be found at:
   https://www.3gpp.org/specifications/Releases.

7.  ATSSS Phase 1: Support for TCP

   For ATSSS with Multipath TCP functionality, a client with two
   interfaces connected to two disjoint access networks (in this case,
   Access Net A and Access Net B) uses MPTCP to reach an MPTCP proxy
   over either, or both, of the access networks.  This allows the client
   to communicate with a server which does not support MPTCP.

   During the attachment of an ATSSS-capable UE to the network, the UE
   may retrieve the MPTCP proxy information: an IP address, a port
   number, and the type of proxy.  In the current release, the mandatory
   MPTCP proxy type is the "Transport Converter"
   [I-D.ietf-tcpm-converters].

   Also, both the MPTCP Client and MPTCP proxy are configured with ATSSS
   rules from the network that govern how the multiple network paths
   between the MPTCP Client and MPTCP proxy are used.  This relationship
   is shown using "." between the MPTCP Client and MPTCP Proxy in
   Figure 2.

                                    TCP

   An ATSSS-capable UE can make use of the MPTCP functionality by
   establishing MPTCP-assisted connections via the MPTCP proxy relying
   upon the Convert Protocol [I-D.ietf-tcpm-converters].  The UE behaves
   as a "Client", while the MPTCP proxy behaves as a Transport Converter
   [I-D.ietf-tcpm-converters].

   The UE then sends packets bound to connections matching an ATSSS rule
   to the provisioned Transport Converter and destination port number.
   Concretely, the UE initiates the MPTCP connection towards the
   Transport Converter and indicates the IP address and port number of
   the Server within the connection establishment packet (i.e., in the
   payload of the SYN sent to the Transport Converter).  Doing so
   enables the Transport Converter to immediately initiate a connection
   towards that Server, without experiencing an extra delay.  The
   Transport Converter waits until the receipt of the confirmation that
   the Server agrees to establish the connection before confirming it to
   the Client.

   A flow example of an MPTCP-proxied connection is shown in Figure 3.
   This example assumes that the Server is not MPTCP-aware.  The
   instructions included in the matching ATSSS rule will be followed for
   the management of the MPTCP connection (including the selection of
   the access network to establish the first subflow).

   This approach provides 0-RTT (Zero Round-Trip Time) conversion
   service since no extra delay is induced by the Convert protocol
   compared to connections that are not proxied.  Also, the Convert
   Protocol does not require any encapsulation (so, no tunnels).  The UE
   and the MPTCP proxy track the performance of the access networks by
   leveraging MPTCP's internal mechanisms including congestion control
   and round-trip-time measurements.  MPTCP uses this performance
   information to support splitting and switching.

   If the server supports MPTCP, the Convert Protocol provides an option
   for clients to "opt-out".  In such case, an MPTCP connection is
   directly established between the client and the server.  Given that
   few servers are MPTCP capable, relying on the ATSSS service is the
   only option for UEs to make use of available multiple paths to most
   servers simultaneously.

7.1.  ATSSS Phase 2: Adding Non-TCP Support

   The MPTCP-based ATSSS approach discussed in the previous section is
   specific to TCP, obviously.  Therefore it does not support non-TCP
   traffic, such as UDP, QUIC [QUIC-Deployment] or IPsec and Datagram
   Transport Layer Security (DTLS) Virtual Private Network (VPN)
   services.

   As the share of these protocols grows, mainly driven by QUIC
   deployment, a future ATSSS needs to extend beyond supporting TCP
   only.  The seamless handover provided by ATSSS is particularly useful
   for real-time traffic (e.g., voice or video calls),

   Several proposals to carry non-TCP traffic have been discussed,
   including using TCP [I-D.boucadair-mptcp-plain-mode] or defining

   multipath extensions to DCCP [I-D.amend-tsvwg-multipath-dccp].  The
   work within 3GPP now focuses on using QUIC as the baseline for ATSSS
   Phase 2.

7.1.1.  QUIC and Multihoming

   For non-TCP traffic, QUIC is already the dominant part of UDP
   traffic.  A solution as realized with the Convert Protocol for
   (MP)TCP is not possible for QUIC as a QUIC connection cannot be
   intercepted and converted as in the ATSSS architecture for (MP)TCP
   (Figure 2).  For (MP)TCP only the transport protocol (TCP) is
   intercepted, while transport security provided by Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) on top of TCP stays in tact.  For QUIC transport,
   security is integrated into the transport protocol and thus cannot be
   intercepted.

   Some ATSSS modes can be natively supported by the base QUIC
   specification for QUIC flows.  For example, the "Active-Standby" and
   "Smallest Delay" steering modes can be supported directly between an
   UE and a QUIC server without any assistance from the network other
   than the performance measurement information.

   Further, QUIC provides a feature called connection migration
   (Section 9 of [I-D.ietf-quic-transport]) that makes it possible to
   move a QUIC connection from one path/IP address to another without
   terminating and reestablishing the connection.  Connection migration
   can further enable traffic switching but does not support traffic
   splitting as only one path can be used simultaneously.

   An extension to QUIC to support simultaneous use of multiple paths is
   proposed in [I-D.deconinck-quic-multipath].  However, similar to a
   native MPTCP connection, a (MP)QUIC connection initiated between the
   UE and a server without the ATSSS UPF assistance cannot benefit from
   any direct application of the ATSSS steering methods based on network
   input given that the steering policy as currently defined in ATSSS is
   local to the UE and the ATSSS UPF and there are no means to signal
   that policy to a remote server.

   Network input can be especially beneficial for cases such as:

   o  avoiding unnecessary use of user quota if one of the access
      networks is subject to volume-based quota.

   o  avoiding frequent connection migration if both access networks
      could be used to forward packets (each with a distinct source IP
      address).

7.1.2.  QUIC as an ATSSS Data Plane Protocol

   This section elaborates how non-TCP traffic (UDP or a subset like
   QUIC) can be encapsulated into a tunnel between the UE and the ATSSS
   UPF to enable ATSSS for all traffic, not only TCP or QUIC.  This
   section discusses to what extent QUIC can be used as a tunneling
   protocol for the ATSSS service and whether gaps are found.

   When tunneling non-TCP (e.g., UDP, IP) over QUIC the Unreliable
   Datagram Extension [I-D.ietf-quic-datagram] can be used.  Each data
   packet would be transported unreliably as a datagram over a QUIC
   connection.  Transporting these datagrams unreliably as would be done
   in IPsec or DTLS-based tunnels is especially important for flows that
   do not require reliable delivery and would suffer from unnecessary
   delays caused by the retransmissions used to support reliability.
   QUIC datagrams are congestion-controlled, but since the latency
   between the UE and the ATSSS UPF is small compared to the end-to-end
   latency, having second, local, congestion control loops should not
   impact the end-to-end congestion control negatively.

   This document discusses three approaches:

   o  Use of QUIC version 1 with the Unreliable Datagram Extension
      Section 7.1.3

   o  Use of QUIC version 1 with the Unreliable Datagram Extension but
      with one QUIC connection over each access network Section 7.1.4

   o  Use of a single Multipath QUIC connection
      [I-D.deconinck-quic-multipath], with the Unreliable Datagram
      Extension, over all access networks Section 7.1.5.

                      Figure 4: Single QUICv1 tunnel

   QUIC can be used as a tunneling protocol between the UE and the ATSSS
   UPF.  Use of the Unreliable Datagram Extension avoids unnecessary
   delays due to local retransmissions and, more important, subsequent
   head-of-line blocking.

   In this case, there is (only) one QUIC connection between the UE and
   the ATSSS UPF for a given flow.  And as such, that QUIC connection
   uses only one access network at a time.  However, given the
   connection migration capability of QUIC, the QUIC connection could be
   moved to another access network, e.g., when the network indicates
   that the currently used access network would go away or that its
   capacity becomes limited.  The UE can then initiate the connection
   migration to start the path validation process as specified in
   Section 9 of [I-D.ietf-quic-transport].  When, and how, to switch
   over depends on the rules provided by the network (Section 5.4) and
   the performance measurements that are accessible to both the UE and
   the ATSSS UPF.  Note that connection migration can only be at the
   initiative of the UE as per Section 9 of [I-D.ietf-quic-transport].
   This means that the UPF cannot make use of a second access network
   upon failure or degradation observed on a first access network.

   It is thus possible to support the switching and steering functions
   of ATSSS, but splitting cannot be supported.

   Path validation induces a delay when switching as packets are
   buffered.  Further, congestion control state is reset on a new path
   and needs to ramp up.  When frequent handovers happen, splitting
   traffic over multiple paths simulaneously can be beneficial for a

   smooth user experience.  Further, of course, the ability to use
   multiple paths simultaneously also increases the maximum capacity
   available, which can also be beneficial in some cases.

   This option is not considered a valid approach for the ATSSS Phase 2
   discussed within 3GPP.

     Figure 5: Traffic steering of two end-to-end flows using multiple
                              QUICv1 tunnels

   Another approach is to use one QUIC connection over each access
   network.  In this case, there are multiple QUIC connections that are
   used as tunnels from the UE to the ATSSS UPF to transport traffic
   that belongs to one or multiple flows.  The UE and ATSSS UPF need to
   select one QUIC connection to forward each application data packet,
   based on the rules provided by the network.

   This approach can support steering (by selecting just one QUIC
   connection for each flow), switching (by moving flows from one QUIC
   connection to another) as well as splitting when both tunnels are
   used simultaneously for different packets of the same flow.

   However, this approach for splitting is challenging since data from
   the same flow are sent over different QUIC connections, again using
   unreliable datagram to minimize head-of-line blocking.  Because both
   these QUIC connections are completely independent of each other and
   the paths on the different access networks may have different

   latency, this approach would likely result in reordering of packets
   that belong to a split flow.  If reordering should be avoided, this
   would require additional signaling between the UE and the ATSSS UPF,
   e.g., adding sequence numbers, and adding a reordering buffer and
   logic to both the UE and ATSSS UPF.

   Furthermore, since the bandwidth available for each QUIC connection
   varies as a function of the congestion experienced over each access
   network, data sent over a congested connection could delay the
   delivery of subsequent data over another connection.

   Experience with MPTCP on smartphones shows that its integrated
   mechanisms (e.g., congestion control, round-trip-time estimation,
   packet scheduler) are well suited to support splitting and switching.
   Providing a similar service over independent QUIC connections would
   require a complex application that would need to track the congestion
   window, round-trip-time, and loss characteristics of the underlying
   QUIC connections as well as some specific application layer
   signalling to glue the various QUIC connections together.

         Figure 6: Traffic splitting using a Multipath QUIC tunnel

   A third candidate solution is to leverage the ability of QUIC to
   support multiple streams and the Unreliable Datagram Extension, and
   to extend it with Multipath capabilities as described in
   [I-D.deconinck-quic-multipath].

Internet-Draft                 QUIC ATSSS                       May 2020


   In this case, there is a single (Multipath) QUIC connection between
   the UE and the ATSSS UPF.  With a multipath transport, splitting is
   naturally supported.

   Data sent over one access network can be retransmitted over the other
   if the first becomes congested.  Some measurements and simulations
   have shown that Multipath QUIC provides similar performance as
   Multipath TCP when combining different access networks
   [MPQUIC-Conext].

   Steering can be also supported, similarly to MPTCP.  The path
   scheduler can map datagrams carrying an entire flow to one or another
   access network based on the provided rules.

   Switching can be improved by splitting traffic simultaneously over
   both links such that the congestion window of the new path can be
   open before the old path goes away.  This makes handovers smoother.
   Experience with Multipath TCP on smartphones has shown that handovers
   are not a binary process.  When a smartphone performs handovers,
   there are frequently short periods of time during which both networks
   are imperfect [MPTester].  Using use both networks simultaneously
   during these periods, improves user experience.

   Furthermore, traffic can be better distributed among available paths
   based on available resources if one of the access networks fails or
   begins to become congested.

7.2.  Mapping of Both TCP and Non-TCP to QUIC Streams and Datagrams

   In ATSSS Phase 1, each TCP connection originated by the UE
   corresponds to one MPTCP connection that is terminated on the ATSSS
   UPF.  With ATSSS Phase 2 using MPQUIC as a tunneling protocol, one
   can leverage the multi-stream capability of QUIC to carry the
   bytestreams of multiple TCP connections over a single MPQUIC session.

   Focusing on the case where the UE maintains one QUIC connection with
   its ATSSS UPF, every TCP connection that it creates results in the
   creation of a new stream of the MPQUIC connection with the ATSSS UPF.
   Similarly the ATSSS UPF can map each incoming TCP connection from a
   remote host onto a stream of the MPQUIC connection.  This is
   illustrated in Figure 7.  Stream mapping is most beneficial for TCP,
   as it avoids reordering and TCP anyway requires in-order delivery.
   It is more appropriate to use QUIC with the Unreliable Datagram
   Extension for all other traffic.

    Figure 7: ATSSS Phase 2 Maps Each TCP Connection on a Stream of the
            MPQUIC Connection Between the UE and the ATSSS UPF

   Two application layer protocols are proposed to manage the mapping of
   TCP connections to QUIC streams as well as the transmission of UDP
   datagrams over QUIC datagrams:

   (1) The proposed masque working group (wg) extends the HTTP/3 CONNECT
   method with a UDPCONNECT method to use QUIC as a tunnel for UDP
   traffic [I-D.schinazi-masque-connect-udp].  Another use case in scope
   for masque wg is IP proxying which can be used for tunneling and
   forwarding of TCP connections [I-D.schinazi-masque-protocol].

   (2) QUIC Tunnel is a close proposal providing similar functionalities
   to MASQUE based on a binary protocol
   [I-D.piraux-quic-tunnel][I-D.piraux-quic-tunnel-tcp], and focusing on
   the ATSSS use case.

   Both proposals rely upon single QUIC connections and inherit thus the
   same issues discussed in Section 7.1.3 and Section 7.1.4.

7.3.  Encapsulation Overhead

   In 3GPP architectures, a variety of encapsulations are already used
   to carry user data.  The use of QUIC as a tunneling method for ATSSS
   will add some additional overhead.  When the user data is forwarded
   over a non-3GPP network access, this overhead comes further in
   addition to an IPsec tunnel between the UE to the 5G Core Network
   which is already at least 142 octets for an IPv6 packet forwarded
   over a non-3GPP network access.  In contrast, the MPTCP based
   mechanism in ATSSS Phase 1 does only add a minor overhead during




Boucadair, et al.       Expires December 1, 2020               [Page 20]

   connection establishment, but no additional overhead during the rest
   of the connection.

   More investigation is required to assess whether the ATSSS Phase 2
   overhead is an issue.  Solutions to optimize that overhead could be
   considered, if needed.

7.4.  Multiple Encryptions

   The use of QUIC as a tunneling protocol in ATSSS will add an
   additional layer of encryption.  As there is already encryptions on
   other layers (e.g., IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)) this
   leads to multiple layers of encryption, which might be redundant.

   Such multiple encryptions will have performance implications on the
   UE, in particular.  Means to optimize the various redundant
   encryptions are for further investigation in 3GPP.

7.5.  Congestion Control in Congestion Control and Coexistence

   Many applications that are sending unreliable traffic use various
   congestion control algorithms to detect congestion and adjust their
   sending rate based on inferred end-to-end latency and loss
   characteristics.  Examples include Adaptive Video Streaming using
   e.g.  SCREAM [RFC8298], or other media streaming applications that
   use QUIC as transport layer.  When using QUIC version 1 with
   Unreliable Datagram Extension or Multipath QUIC as ATSSS solution,
   this leads to nested congestion control, where both inner and outer
   congestion control coexist.  When using Multiple QUICv1 tunnels with
   Unreliable Datagram Extension or MP-QUIC tunneling, the packet
   scheduler could have an additional impact on the perceived end-to-end
   latency and loss due to the potential difference of the individual
   path characteristics.

   When deploying ATSSS Phase 1 and Phase 2 in parallel, with the UE
   serving both reliable and unreliable flows, different congestion
   control algorithms may coexist on individual paths, which may lead to
   fairness issues or even meltdown effects.

   We recognize that nested congestion control mechanisms (such as QUIC
   encapsulated in QUIC or SCREAM encapsulated in QUIC) as well as the
   coexistence of ATSSS Phase 1 and Phase 2 have implications that
   require further study.

7.6.  Packet Order Reconstruction for (MP-)QUIC Splitting Mode

   Both tunnel solutions in Section 7.1.4 and Section 7.1.5 allow the
   splitting mode for simultaneously sending data over multiple paths.
   In this case packet reordering can occur when a QUIC tunnel
   communication is split across paths with very different latencies.
   Generally, applications have to deal with packet reordering, since
   the best effort for Internet traffic has no guarantee to prevent it.
   However, in practice, packet reordering in the network is assumed to
   be very limited.  Applications that require in-order delivery and
   e.g. rely on TCP or implement a similar mechanism itself can be
   sensitive to high amounts of reordering and experience decreased
   performance.

   As such it is desirable that the respective receiver side of the
   tunnel termination points has the ability to reconstruct the original
   packet ordering.  While in the case when using the MPTCP converter,
   losses are retransmitted quickly on the local segment, when the
   Unreliable Datagram Extension for QUIC is used, the reconstruction
   mechanism has to further account for packet loss which may occur for
   any of the paths within the QUIC tunnel.  This can cause delays in
   the reordering logic, which in turn can have a negative impact on
   applications that do not require in-order delivery, such as real-time
   transmissions.

   It is assumed that this is a solvable task similar to [MPDCCP-paper],
   but is probably left to the implementer, to take care.  Even if the
   reconstruction of the packet order does not become a standardized
   part of the MP-QUIC in Section 7.1.5, it possibly requires path
   sequencing and end-to-end sequencing.

8.  QUICv1 Gap Analysis for ATSSS Phase 2

   This section summarizes QUIC protocol capabilities that would be
   beneficial for ATSSS Phase 2, as described in Section 7.1.

   o  ATSSS Phase 2 is focused on transport services for Ethernet frames
      and IP packets (with the intention of supporting TCP, UDP, and
      UDP-encapsulated transport protocols such as QUIC).  The discussed
      approaches are based on tunnelling Ethernet or IP directly over
      QUIC.  The masque working group that is currently in the
      chartering validation process is scoped to cover UDP and IP
      proxying.  While UDP proxying does cover the most important use
      case to support ATSSS for UDP/QUIC, a more generic solution based
      on IP proxying would simplify the ATSSS design.  However, IP
      proxying is only considered at a later stage by the masque working
      group.  Also, multipath mechanisms of QUIC are not covered in the
      proposed charter.

Internet-Draft                 QUIC ATSSS                       May 2020


   o  We envision the ability to select paths (steering), detect path
      failures and reroute traffic (switching), and forward packets on
      multiple active paths simultaneously (splitting), based on
      external policies, including active-standby, smallest delay,
      weighted load-balancing, and path selection based on assigned
      priorities, for the full range of encapsulated protocols in ATSSS
      Phase 2, similar to the abilities provided by Multipath TCP for
      ATSSS Phase 1.  Splitting cannot be supported easily in the
      discussed QUICv1-based approaches.  Multipath transport capability
      similar to Multipath TCP, as used in ATSSS Phase 1, would support
      splitting well.  The QUIC working group is originally chartered to
      produce a multipath extension document by December 2021.
      Proposals exist, however, this work has been postponed to QUICv2
      and discussion is still on-going if support will be kept in the
      charter.

   o  While the base protocol for QUICv1 does not provide support for
      unreliable datagrams, an QUIC extension for datagram support has
      been adopted by the group and the QUIC working group is chartered
      to produce this capability by March 2021.  This can be used to
      support for the additional user-plane protocols as envisioned in
      ATSSS Phase 2.

   o  When QUIC is used as a tunneling protocol, nested congestion
      control mechanisms (such as QUIC encapsulated in QUIC) have
      implications that require further study.

   o  When QUIC is used as a tunneling protocol, the complete ATSSS
      Phase 2 protocol stack would include encrypted headers at multiple
      layers.  It needs further investigation if this is a problem for
      ATSSS, however, it is likely a problem that can be solved by the
      3GPP.  Likewise, the implications of the various encapsulation
      overhead is to be further assessed within 3GPP.

   considerations are discussed in Section 21 of
   [I-D.ietf-quic-transport].

   This document does not specify specific mechanisms to use QUIC as a
   tunneling protocol towards an ATSSS proxy, as the intention of this
   document is to provide an informational overview of the ongoing work
   in 3GPP on ATSSS to support non-TCP, rather than discussing a
   detailed solution.  Nevertheless, this document cites candidate
   solutions to provide such tunneling service.  Security considerations
   specific to these solutions are provided below.

   Multipath QUIC-specific security considerations can be found in
   Section 8 of [I-D.deconinck-quic-multipath].

   Section 6 of {I-D.ietf-quic-datagram} discusses security
   considerations specific to the use of the Unreliable Datagram
   Extension to QUIC.
