Internet-Draft           Atom Person Extensions            February 2006


1.  Introduction

   The Atom Person construct provides a limited set of metadata elements
   for describing individuals or entities who have authored or
   contributed to a feed or entry.  In addition to this core set of
   data, feed publishers may wish to provide richer descriptions of
   those individuals.  The extensions defined by this specification
   provide mechanism for expressing rich user profile, identity and
   contribution roles for an individual author or contributor.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119]

   This specification uses XML Namespaces [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114]
   to uniquely identify XML element names.  It uses the following
   namespace prefix for the indicated namespace URI;

   {Ed.  Note: this namespace MUST be changed to a proper IETF namespace
   scheme prior to publication}

    "pe": "http://purl.org/atompub/person-extensions/1.0"


3.  Person Profiles

3.1.  The 'profile' Element

   Person Profiles are rich metadata descriptions about an individual
   author or contributor.  Using the 'profile' element, Profiles may be
   included directly within an Atom Person Construct or referenced
   externally.

   An out-of-line FOAF Profile

     <pe:profile type="application/rdf+xml"
       src="http://example.org/johndoe.foaf"
       scheme="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/" />

3.2.  The 'type' attribute

   The 'profile' element 'type' attribute value MUST be either one of
   'text', 'html', or 'xhtml' or a non-composite MIME media type.  If
   neither the type or src attributes are provided, the value of the
   'type' attribute MUST be assumed to be 'text'.

3.3.  The 'src' attribute

   The 'profile' element MAY contain a 'src' attribute whose value is an
   IRI reference.  If the 'src' attribute is present, the 'profile'
   element MUST be empty.  Atom Processors MAY use the IRI to retrieve
   the profile and MAY choose to either ignore the remote profile or to
   present it in a manner different than a profile included directly
   within the Person Construct.

   If the "src" attribute is present, the "type" attribute SHOULD be
   provided and MUST be a MIME media type [MIMEREG], rather than "text",
   "html", or "xhtml".  The value is advisory; that is to say, when the
   corresponding URI (mapped from an IRI, if necessary) is dereferenced,
   if the server providing that content also provides a media type, the
   server-provided media type is authoritative.

3.4.  The 'scheme' attribute

   The 'profile' element MAY contain a 'scheme' attribute whose value is
   an IRI that may be used to provide additional differentiation of the
   profile scheme.

3.5.  Processing Model

   Processors MUST interpret the 'profile' element according to the
   first applicable rule.

   1.  If the value of "type" is "text", the content of 'profile' MUST
       NOT contain child elements.  Such text MAY or MAY NOT be intended
       to be presented to humans in a readable fashion.  Thus,
       Processors MUST NOT collapse white space (including line breaks)
       or apply any typographic techniques such as justification or
       proportional fonts.

Internet-Draft           Atom Person Extensions            February 2006


   2.  If the value of "type" is "html", the content of 'profile' MUST
       NOT contain child elements and SHOULD be suitable for handling as
       HTML.  The HTML markup MUST be escaped; for example, "<br>" as
       "&lt;br>".  The HTML markup SHOULD be such that it could validly
       appear directly within an HTML <DIV> element.  Processors that
       display the content MAY use the markup to aid in displaying it.
   3.  If the value of "type" is "xhtml", the content of 'profile' MUST
       be a single XHTML div element [XHTML] and SHOULD be suitable for
       handling as XHTML.  The XHTML div element itself MUST NOT be
       considered part of the content of the profile.  Processors that
       display the content MAY use the markup to aid in displaying it.
       The escaped versions of characters such as "&" and ">" represent
       those characters, not markup.
   4.  If the value of "type" is an XML media type [RFC3023] or ends
       with "+xml" or "/xml" (case insensitive), the content of
       'profile' MAY include child elements and SHOULD be suitable for
       handling as the indicated media type.  If the "src" attribute is
       not provided, this would normally mean that the 'profile' element
       would contain a single child element that would serve as the root
       element of the XML document of the indicated type.
   5.  If the value of "type" begins with "text/" (case insensitive),
       the content of 'profile' MUST NOT contain child elements.
   6.  For all other values of "type", the content of 'profile' MUST be
       a valid Base64 encoding, as described in [RFC3548], section 3.
       When decoded, it SHOULD be suitable for handling as the indicated
       media type.  In this case, the characters in the Base64 encoding
       MAY be preceded and followed in the 'profile' element by white
       space, and lines are separated by a single newline (U+000A)
       character.


4.  Identity

4.1.  The 'identity' Element

   The 'identity' element is used to associate an identity token with an
   Atom Person Construct.

       attribute src { atomURI },
       empty
     }

     identity = inlineIdentity
       | outOfLineIdentity

   An out-of-line OpenID Identity

     <pe:identity
       scheme="http://openid.net"
       href="http://www.example.org" />

   An in-line, Base64-encoded X.509 Identity

     <pe:identity
       type="application/x509-user-cert">
       {base64 encoded binary data}
     </pe:identity>

4.2.  The 'type' attribute

   The 'identity' element 'type' attribute value MUST be a non-composite
   MIME media type.

4.3.  The 'scheme' attribute

   The 'identity' element MAY contain a 'scheme' attribute whose value
   is an IRI that may be used to provide additional differentiation of
   the identity scheme.

4.4.  The 'src' attribute

   The 'identity' element MAY contain a 'src' attribute whose value is
   an IRI reference.  If the 'src' attribute is present, the 'identity'
   element MUST be empty.  Atom Processors MAY use the IRI to retrieve
   the identity token and MAY choose to either ignore the remote

   identity or to present it in a manner different than an identity
   included directly within the Person Construct.

   If the "src" attribute is present, the value of the "type" attribute
   is advisory; that is to say, when the corresponding URI (mapped from
   an IRI, if necessary) is dereferenced, if the server providing that
   content also provides a media type, the server-provided media type is
   authoritative.

4.5.  Processing Model

   Processors MUST interpret the 'identity' element according to the
   first applicable rule.

   1.  If the value of "type" is an XML media type [RFC3023] or ends
       with "+xml" or "/xml" (case insensitive), the content of
       'profile' MAY include child elements and SHOULD be suitable for
       handling as the indicated media type.  If the "src" attribute is
       not provided, this would normally mean that the 'profile' element
       would contain a single child element that would serve as the root
       element of the XML document of the indicated type.
   2.  If the value of "type" begins with "text/" (case insensitive),
       the content of 'profile' MUST NOT contain child elements.
   3.  For all other values of "type", the content of 'profile' MUST be

       MAY be preceded and followed in the 'profile' element by white
       space, and lines are separated by a single newline (U+000A)
       character.


5.  Contribution Roles

5.1.  The 'role' Element

   The 'role' element may be used to associate a specific contribution
   role with an Atom Person Construct.  Contribution roles are useful to
   differentiating the different types of contributions (e.g. author,
   editor, translator, etc) an individual entity may have made to the
   creation of a feed or entry.

     role = element pe:role {
       atomCommonAttributes,
       attribute scheme { atomURI }?,
       attribute term { atomURI },
       attribute label { text }?,
       empty

       <pe:role scheme="http://www.loc.gov/marc"
         term="trc"
         label="Transcriber" />
     </contributor>

5.2.  The 'scheme' attribute

   The 'scheme' attribute is an IRI that identifies a role
   classification scheme.

5.3.  The 'term' attribute

   The 'term' attribute is a string that identifies the role associated
   with the Person construct.

5.4.  The 'label' attribute

   The 'label' attribute provides a language-sensitive, human-readable
   label for display in end-user applications.  Entities such as "&amp;"
   and "&lt;" represent their corresponding characters ("&" and "<",
   respectively), not markup.
