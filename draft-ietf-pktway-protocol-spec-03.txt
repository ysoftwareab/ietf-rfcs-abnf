Abstract

   PacketWay's goal is to move data from a "Source" (a node on a System
   Area Network) to a "Destination" (another node, probably on another
   System Area Network) at the high performance available on these SANs.
   Sources and Destinations can be physical things (a processor or a
   smart memory board).  They can also be "logical" things, such as a
   group of cooperating processes.

			      INTRODUCTION
			      ------------

PacketWay is an open family of specifications for internetworking
high-performance System Area Networks (SANs) and high-performance LANs. 

Even though most modern SANs have much in common (such as high rates,
low latency, low BER, being packet networks made of point-to-point links
with flow control, and the usage of source routes), each is an island
upon itself, incapable of direct inter-communications with other SANs.
PacketWay's goal is to "internet" such SANs and high-performance LANs.

The core of the PktWay protocol is its End/End Protocol (EEP) and its
Router/Router-Protocol (RRP).  Above the core several extension are
expected to be defined (and implemented), including dynamic resource
and routing discovery, secure-PktWay, and multicast-PktWay.

This part describes the PacketWay EEP (End/End Protocol).  Part-2
describes the PacketWay RRP (Router/Router Protocol).  Part-3 defines
the format of the RRP packets.  Other PacketWay layers, such as the
PacketWay dynamic discovery security, multicast, and a PktWay Server
Layer, will be described in documents to be provided later.

Some basic PacketWay terminology requires explanation.  PacketWay
interconnects high-performance System Area Networks (SANs).  Each
SAN contains some "nodes".  At least one node in each SAN is also
a PacketWay "router", connected to more than one SAN.

PacketWay's goal is to move data from a "Source" (e.g., a node on
a SAN) to a "Destination" (e.g., a node on another SAN).  Sources and
Destinations can be physical entities (a processor or a smart memory
board).  They can also be logical entities (a group of cooperating
processes).  These nodes include sources, destinations, and routers.

Within each instance of PacketWay all nodes have unique 24-bit
PacketWay addresses.  A system designer can assign these "PacketWay
Addresses" manually.  Alternatively, the optional PacketWay Server
Layer provides a way to assign and discover addresses dynamically.
Throughout this document "address" always means the 24-bit PacketWay
address.

SANs also may have PacketWay addresses, aka SAN-IDs.  They are also
24-bit quantities, sharing the address space with the nodes.  These
addresses, of SANs and nodes, are unique within each instance of
PacketWay.

To optimize for performance, PacketWay has a data transfer mode that
leverages the native message routing schemes used within the SANs.
This mode uses a "Planned Transfer" paradigm.  During the planning phase,
a source collects information on optimal routes to a destination,
expressed in the various native formats of the intervening SANs.
A source later uses this information for low latency transfers to that
destination.  In PacketWay, the transfer phase of a Planned Transfer
is called "L2-forwarding."  Appendix-B shows an example of the planning
phase.
Introduction                      <04>                          PktWay-WG



PacketWay also optionally supports a more traditional data transfer
mode that requires no planning.  Such transfers specify the destinations
by their addresses only.  PacketWay calls this more traditional
approach "L3-forwarding."

PacketWay packets travel through SANs encapsulated inside the native
packet format of each SAN, by being prefixed with the routing header and
followed by the tail as required by that SAN.

PacketWay packets get to their destinations by Level-2 (L2) forwarding,
Level-3 (L3) forwarding, or a combination thereof.

In L3-forwarding (similar to IP forwarding), the L2-routing through each
SAN is determined by an inter-SAN router upon entering that SAN.  The
router prefixes the packet with an L2 routing header (such as a source
route) corresponding to the destination address specified in the packet.
It is a task for that router to determine the L2-routing-header
corresponding to the given PacketWay-address.

In L2-forwarding the source prefixes the packet with all the L2-routing
headers needed along the path to the destination.  Each router has only
to get the L2-routing-header from the leading L2RH (L2-Routing-Header
record) that was provided by the source.

PacketWay does not provide Segmentation and Reassembly (SAR).
Therefore, the length of a packet cannot exceed the minimum MTU
(Maximum Transmission Unit) along its path.

PacketWay does not detect errors.  It only gathers error detection
information from the SANs and inter-SAN routers that a packet transits.

PacketWay is big-Endian 8B-word based.


NOTATIONS
+--------

8B means "8-byte" (64 bits).

0x indicates hexadecimal values (e.g., 0x0100 is 2^8=256-decimal).

0b indicates binary values (e.g., 0b0100 is 4-decimal).

xxx indicate a field that is discarded without any checking (e.g., padding).

[fff] indicates that fff is an optional field.

All length fields do not include themselves, and therefore may be zero.

		    Part-1: PacketWay EEP messages
		    -------------------------------

The PacketWay MESSAGE STRUCTURE
+------------------------------

PacketWay messages have 5 components, including 3 optional ones:

[1]: [Optional Sequence of L2-Routing-Headers Records (L2RHs) and Symbols]
[2]: EEP Header (16 bytes)		              (PH)
[3]: [Optional Header fields]                         (OH)
[4]: [Optional, Most likely: Data Block]   	      (DB)
[5]: [Optional Trailer fields]                        (OT)
[6]: EEP Trailer (8 bytes)                            (TAIL)

Re [1]: as explained later, if the 9th+10th bits of a messages are 0b11
then the message starts with an L2RH (or a symbol).  If the 9th through
the 12th bits of a message are 0b1011 then this message starts with a
"symbol".  The other values of these bits indicate the lack of L2RH and
symbols and that the message begins with the EEP-header.

Re [3]: if the h-bit in the EEP header [2] is 1 then there are optional
header fields.  The sequence of these header fields is terminated with a
word whose 2 MSBytes are 0xFF00.

Re [4]: if DL>0, in the EEP header, zero then a Data Block (DB) is
included in this message.

Re [5]: the optional header fields, [3], may indicate that some optional
trailer fields are present after the DB, [4].  The order and the formats
of the trailer fields are defined by the optional header fields.

It is expected that most messages will have Data Blocks (DB), and that
most messages will not have Optional Header fields (OH), nor trailer
fields (OT).

[1], the leading L2RHs and symbols are consumed by the SANs before
reaching the destination which receives only the other components, [2]
through [6].  These parts, [2] to [6], constitute the End/End Protocol
of PacketWay.

TAIL, the EEP trailer, [6] may be modified along the way to the
destination, unlike [2], [3] and [4], which arrive exactly as sent
by the source.

Each PacketWay packet may be first L2-forwarded (zero or more times)
before being L3-forwarded (zero or more times).

Although PacketWay headers and trailers are always in Big Endian order,
the byte order of the Data Block is not defined by PacketWay.

Since all the elements of PacketWay (L2RHs, EEP-headers, optional
fields, data, and EEP-trailers) are always multiples of 8B-words,
it is recommended that PacketWay headers (and data) be aligned on
8B-boundaries.
RRP-Msgs                          <06>                          PktWay-WG



[1]: Optional Sequence of L2-Routing-Headers Records (L2RHs) and Symbols
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

A PacketWay source may specify native routes, by placing the native
routes before the PacketWay Header.  The native routes (for all SANs and
LANs beyond the initial one) must appear within a sequence of PacketWay
L2-Routing-Header records (L2RH).

The contents of the L2RH are totally SAN dependent, with the exception
of the first 2 bytes that distinguish this record from an EEP-header and
also provide the Length (L) indicating the number of routing bytes of
that L2RH (not including these 2 bytes).

L is always between 0 and 63.  The total number of bytes in the L2RH is
L+2, packed in [(L+9)/8] 8B-words (where the square brackets [] indicate
the integer part of the quantity within).

It's up to each SAN to provide padding, if needed, to fill the L2RH words.  

Each L2RH is defined by the entity that will process it.  In addition
to routing information per se, it may also include demuxing information
such as a local message-type.  For example, over Myrinet it should end
with 0x0300 which is the Myrinet-type assigned to PacketWay.

The L2 header must contain enough information to allow a router to
quickly create any necessary local routing headers and trailers.
PacketWay implementations that support L2-forwarding must document
their unique L2 header requirements.

When a PacketWay message is encapsulated inside any native SAN message
(Paragon or Myrinet, for example), it's up to that SAN to distinguish
between it and its own native packets.  This is not a PacketWay issue.
For example, Myrinet uses its Message-Type to recognize PacketWay
messages.

PacketWay-Routers on the boundaries between SANs are asked to forward
packets with either L2 or L3 routings.  The former start with an L2RH,
(having both its 9th and its 10th bits set to 1), whereas the latter
start with PacketWay-addresses (with other values for these 2 bits).

FORMAT:

Each L2RH is in the format:

+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|vv000000|11LLLLLL|  SR01  |  SR02  |........|........|........|  xxx   | L2RH
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

The first 2 bits are 0b00 for the working version of the protocol.
They may have other values for experimental versions.

The next 6 bits should be all zeroes.
PktWay-WG                         <07>                           EEP-Msgs



The next two bits must be 0b11 to indicate that this is an L2RH record.
The next 6 bits are the byte count of the routing information that
starts in the third byte and is followed by as many padding bytes as
needed to fill to the next 8B-boundary.  The length of the routing
information is expected to be between 1 and 63 bytes.

This 0b11 was chosen to be consistent with the 0b11 of PktWay-addresses,
as described in [2] below.


EXAMPLES:

An L2RH with an SR with 5 routing bytes:

        0b11   L=5    #1       #2       #3       #4       #5    padding
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|vv000000|11000101|  SR01  |  SR02  |  SR03  |  SR04  |  SR05  |  xxx   | L2RH
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
          ^^      |<---------- routing information ----------->|

An L2RH with an SR with 13 routing bytes:

        0b11  L=13    #1       #2       #3       #4       #5       #6
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|vv000000|11001101|  SR01  |  SR02  |  SR03  |  SR04  |  SR05  |  SR06  | L2RH
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|  SR07  |  SR08  |  SR09  |  SR10  |  SR11  |  SR12  |  SR13  |  xxx   |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
    #7       #8       #9       #10      #11      #12     #13    padding

Symbols (to be defined later) may be mixed among the L2RHs, before the
EEP-header.  Their format is:

+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|vv000000|1011ssss|ssssssss|ssssssss| Length |  data  |........|........|Symbol
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

[3]: Optional Header Fields (OH)
+-------------------------------

A PacketWay-message has optional header fields (OH) if the Option-Flag
(h) is set to 1 in the EEP-header.

Each OH is in the format:

+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|TCtttttt|LLLLLLLL|  data  |........|........|........|........|........| OH
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

The first byte indicates the optional header field type (OH-TYPE).

The first bit, T, of the first byte indicates the processing of this
OH-TYPE:

 T=0: Optional (may drop this field if this OH-TYPE is unknown)
 T=1: Mandatory (should not process this message if this OH-TYPE is unknown)

The second bit, C, of the first byte indicates that there are more more
trailer fields (i.e., whether this is the last field of this message).

 C=0: More Optional header fields follow
 C=1: End of Optional header fields group

The other 6 bits of this byte, tttttt, define application-specific
OH-TYPEs.

The second byte is the byte-count of the data for this field that starts
in the third byte, and is padded with as many padding bytes as needed to
fill 8B-words.  E.g., L=(0-6) implies one 8B-word. L=(7-14) implies two.
L does not include itself, and can range from 0 to 255.

Example: An Optional Header Field (OH) with a mandatory OH-TYPE and 4
data bytes:
               L=4    #1       #2       #3       #4    padding  padding
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|1xtttttt|00000100| data01 | data02 | data03 | data04 |  xxx   |  xxx   | OH
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
                  |<------------- value ------------->|
PktWay-WG                         <09>                           EEP-Msgs



[4]: Optional Data Block (DB)
+----------------------------

The DB is free for applications to use in any way.  Routers must not
modify this field.

The DB has DL 8B-words, including optional padding (at the end) of PL
bytes.  Hence, the number of data bytes is 8*DL-PL.  Both DL and PL are
defined in the EEP-header.

The maximum length of the DB is 8*(2^25-1)B=256MB.


[5]: Optional Trailer Fields (OT)
+--------------------------------

A PacketWay-message has optional trailer fields (OT) if so indicated in
an Optional Header field, e.g., an OH field may indicate that a CRC64
is in the OT.

An OT may have just the data for an OH defined above (in the EEP
header), or be a stand alone field in the same format as OH.

The OT-fields are in the order defined by the OHs.  For example, if an
OH-field indicating that a CRC32 is in the OT, is followed by another
OH-fields indicating that a CRC64 is in the OT, then the OT with the
CRC32 should be followed by the OT with the CRC64.


[6]: EEP Trailer (TAIL)
+----------------------

The TAIL consists of only the Error Indication (EI) field which is a
single 8B-word.

Routers may start forwarding packets toward their destinations before
detecting transmission errors (wormhole routing).  The EI field provides
such routers with a means to append an error indication to the end of a
packet.


An all zero EI value means that no error was indicated.
Any non zero EI value indicates one or more errors.

The packet source will usually initialize the EI field to all zeros.
However, as an alternative example, a memory board may create a packet
with a non zero EI field (EI=1) that indicates that a parity error was
detected by the memory board.

Each router does an arithmetic left shift, on the EI field by one bit
unless its MSbit is 1.  Routers that detect transmission errors also set
the LSbit (after the shift) to 1.

This provides the ability to identify which routers have indicated
errors (if the route is known).

Version (V) 2 bits

  This field is static.  Its 2 bits are 0b00 for the working version of
  the protocol.  These bits should have other values for experimental
  versions.

Priority (P) unsigned integer, 6 bits

  It is anticipated that some SANs, especially those working in real
  time, will want to implement priorities.  This field supports such
  usage.

  All ones is the highest priority, and all zeroes the lowest.  Ideally,
  packets with higher priority should gain access to contested resources
  before packets with lower priority.  Implementations may ignore the
  Priority field.

Destination Address (DA) 24 bits

  This field contains the PacketWay address of the destination.

  Addresses are unique within each instance of PacketWay.  Nodes
  should have addresses assigned to them.  The method of assigning
  addresses to PacketWay nodes is not specified here.

  Examples of potentially addressable PacketWay nodes include: groups
  of cooperating processes, an entire MPP, or each of an MPP's many
  processors or processes.

  All half-routers (as defined in Part-2) must have addresses so that
  they can exchange control and configuration packets with other
  routers.

  The 24-bit PacketWay address space is divided into several segments,
  each identified by the most significant bit(s) of the address.

  The 0b11xx was chosen for L2RH to be consistent with the 0b11
  indication of L2RHs, as described in [1] above.

  LAs, "Logical Addresses", (for broadcast and for multicast groups)
  are also in this address space.  An address is a "Logical Address"
  if its 4 MSbits are set to 0b1010.

  Certain RRP messages specify addresses either as a unique address or
  as a set of addresses, by (min,max) or by (value,mask).

  A few Physical-addresses are reserved:

    0x000000  Undefined address (illegal where an address is expected)

    0x7FFFFE ("Hey-You!") This address could be used at power up
	     to address nodes or routers, over point-to-point links.
	     ("If you receive it, it's for you.")

    0x7FFFFF (Broadcast) This address is reserved for broadcast
	     operations which may be added in later versions.
	     ("If you receive it, it's for you.")


Type Extension (TE) 2 bytes

  An extension of the following PT field.

  Logically, the TE should be after the PT.  However, the PT is 8B-word
  aligned, easier to process than the TE which is not 8B-aligned.  Since
  the PT is more frequently used than the TE, it was assigned to the
  better aligned field.

Packet Type (PT) 2 bytes

  The intent of the PT field is to provide all the information needed
  for demuxing in support of multiple protocol layers.  Whereas
  traditional protocol layering requires several stages of sequential
  demuxing, PacketWay is expected to provide enough information to
  support a single combined demuxing (such as in support of zero copy
  TCP).

  PT values to support popular parallel programming APIs such as MPI
  will be defined.  The Enumeration Appendix (A1) defines several values
  for this PT field.

  Some PTs use also the preceeding 2 bytes of the Type Extension (TE)
  field for passing PT-specific parameters.

  However, layered protocols cannot be ignored.  The PT field can also
  define data blocks as containing IP, SNMP, ATM, Ethernet, and other
  popular layered protocols.  The PT will be then used for that purpose,
  as done throughout the internet (e.g., "ether-types").

  For example, here are PT values a memory board may need:

     PT        Meaning
  ---------    --------------------------------------------------------
  MEM-WRITE -- Treat the first 8 bytes of the Data Block as a local
               memory-address and write the remaining data into memory.

  MEM-READ  -- Treat the data block as 2 8B-memory-addresses and an 
               8B-byte count.  Generate a return WRITE packet containing
	       the first address, followed by the appropriate data,
	       that was read from the second address.

  The PT field will also indicate the commands used in the PacketWay
  Router/Router configuration and control Protocol (RRP).

  We will define a special PT value that specifies that the Data Block
  contains an embedded PacketWay message, complete with another EEP
  header, and, potentially, prefixed L2-Routing-Headers.  This feature
  will allow to use L3-routing to an intermediate node, followed by
  L2-routing from there to the final destination.

  Special Types

    RRP - PacketWay's Router/Router protocol (see Part-2).

    ERR - Error reporting packet, usually sent to the Source Address
          (SA, see below) in response to a PacketWay message that
          could not be properly handled, such as "Destination Unknown."
          The TE indicates the nature of the error (e.g., UNK) as
          defined in the Enumeration Appendix (A4).

Endianness (E), 4 bits

  The idea is that if the SAN interface of the receiving-node detects
  Endianness that is different than its own and if the entire Data Block
  (DB) consists of N-byte fields, then it may kick in byte-swapping
  hardware for N-byte fields, saving much work for the receiving node.

  e, the first bit (MSbit) of E, indicates that the DB is in Big-Endian
  order (e=0) or in Little-Endian order (e=1).  The next 3 bits could
  control hardware byte swapping, if any, which assumes that all the
  data consists of words of the same length.

	e000: don't swap, it's 8-bit data
	e001: swap as if all the data is  16-bit words
	e010: swap as if all the data is  32-bit words
        e011: swap as if all the data is  64-bit words
	e100: swap as if all the data is 128-bit words
	e101: illegal and reserved for future use
	e110: illegal and reserved for future use
	e111: illegal and reserved for future use

Pad Length (PL) unsigned integer, 3 bits

  The number of padding bytes that were added at the end of the DB
  (i.e., from the end of the data to the end of the DB).  PL can be
  between 0 and 7.

Data Length (DL) unsigned integer, 25 bits

  Length, in 8B-words, of the data block (not including the L2RHs,
  EEP-header, OH, OT, and TAIL, including any optional padding.  Hence,
  the net length of the Data Block is 8*DL-PL bytes.  The minimum is
  zero, and the maximum length is (2^25-1)*8 bytes ~ 2^28 ~ 256 MBytes.

Optional Header-Field Flag (h) 1 bit

  This bit is set to 1 if there is one (or more) optional header fields
  following the standard 16-byte EEP-header.

Reserved (RZ) 7 bits

  This field is reserved for future use.  Applications should neither
  use it, nor count on others not to use it.  In this version it should
  be always set to zero (0b0000000).

Source Address (SA) 24 bit

  This field contains the physical address of the packet's original
  source in the same format as DA.  However, unlike DA, the SA must
  be a physical address.

  Filling in this field is optional.  A value of zero means that the SA
  is not specified.

  Routers may use this field to identify the sender to which error
  messages may be returned.

		    Part-2: PacketWay RRP messages
		    ------------------------------

PacketWay is an open family of specifications for internetworking System
Area Networks (SANs).  This part-2 of the PktWay specification describes
the RRP (Router to Router Protocol) part of the PacketWay-protocol.
The RRP is built on top of the PacketWay-EEP described in Part-1.
Part-3 defines and discusses the format of the RRP packets.

We introduce some new terminology within this document.  A PacketWay
Router always bridges (at least) two SANs.  The Router consists of three
parts: the "Half Router" (HR) attached to the first SAN, the HR attached
to the second SAN, and their interconnection.

PacketWay does not define the nature of this interconnection.
However, we believe the PCI Local Bus de facto standard will become
a very popular link.

This document specifies a series of options that allow system designers
to deploy PacketWay routers of varying levels of intelligence.  Each
router is considered as a set of interconnected Half-Routers (HRs),
each being a full fledged address-bearing node on some SAN.

There are several implementation levels of PktWay, indicated by a letter
code, which are specified differently for nodes and routers. The higher
the letter code ("A" = lowest), the more interoperability and
adaptability result.  System designers may choose the level of
implementation to best suit their needs.

Node implementation levels ("A" being the lowest):

    Level-A: Built-in L2 source routes
    Level-B: Built-in L3 addresses (dynamic update of first HR)
    Level-C: Requesting and receiving dynamic information

Level-A nodes send messages by using L2-forwarding, by specifying
SRs (in L2RHs) that are hard-coded into them, without the ability
to dynamically acquire or modify them.

Level-B nodes have, in addition, the ability to send messages by
using L3-forwarding, by specifying addresses that are hard-coded into
them (without the ability to dynamically acquire them).  These nodes can
ask HRs for the best first HR for any destination node (specified by its
address) and for the SR to destination nodes.  In addition they can also
handle re-direct messages, telling them which HR to use for given nodes.

Level-C nodes can also locate L3-nodes by asking HRs to provide the
attributes of nodes specified by addresses, names, and/or capabilities.
They also respond to such queries by reporting their own attributes.

Router implementation levels ("A" being the lowest):

    Level-A: Forwarding according to L2 source routes
    Level-B: Handling L3 addresses, and dynamic first HR (re-direct, etc)
    Level-C: Supporting node discovery
RRP-msgs                          <16>                          PktWay-WG



HRs can support nodes of the same (or lower) implementation level.

Level-A routers support only L2-Forwarding, and do not support the
planning phase of Planned Transfers.  Therefore, nodes which use Level-A
routers must have the necessary native routes hard-coded into them
(e.g., burned into a PROM somewhere).

Level-B routers also support L3-Forwarding, and advise nodes about the
first HR to use for each destination.  They add the planning phase of
Planned Transfers (by supporting requests for routes, [GVL2] and
[L2SR]).

Level-C routers help nodes discover (resources by capabilities).

PktWay is designed for the highest implementation levels, but will
interoperate with instances of PktWay using lower implementation levels.


THE BASIC PACKETWAY MODEL 

The basic model of PktWay is a set of SANs (System Area Networks), each
with its own conventions and protocols, using a common protocol (PktWay)
for interconnection.

The interconnection between SANs is via PacketWay-routers.  A router
between SAN-A and SAN-B is composed of two interconnected processes,
each a node on a SAN, complying with the conventions of their SANs..
These processes are known as HRs ("Half-Routers") or "SAN-interfaces."

These HRs may be implemented by two separate "boxes" with an inter-SAN
communication link between them, or inside a single "multi-homed" box
that has interfaces to both SANs, interconnected via some bus or SAN.

RRP defines (via message structure and behavior) the interactions
between HRs, and between HRs and computing nodes.  RRP does not define
the lower level protocols that deliver its messages (over links, or
between processes in multi-homed routers).  In particular, RRP does not
define the inter-SAN interconnection links between the HRs -- these are
left for mutual agreements among the implementors.  These links are
expected to range from serial fibers to PCI buses.  An optional PPP-like
protocol may be defined later for these links.

It is assumed that each HR has a Routing Table (RT) for its own SAN
(aka Local Routing Table, LRT), with (at least) the addresses of all
the nodes, and the source routes to each of them from the HR.  This
information could be dynamic or static, even manually configured.
The HRs may (or may not) perform dynamic mapping of their SANs.

It is also assumed that each node, on each SAN/LAN, knows the SR to at
least one HR on its SAN/LAN.
PktWay-WG                         <17>                           RRP-msgs



In L2 operation under levels C , when a source node, SA, needs to send
a message to a destination node, DA, it first asks any of the HRs on its
[SA's] SAN for a source route (SR) from HR to DA.  That HR would (1)
provide such an SR, or (2) reply with a "re-direct" message, suggesting
to ask another HR which is also on SA's SAN, or (3) report no knowledge
of DA (using the UNK error message).

SA may ask more than one HR for SRs to the same DA and use any algorithm
to choose which of these SRs to use.

RRP does not specify whether (and how) to cache SRs.

In L3 operation, when a source node, SA, needs to send a message to a
destination node, DA, it sends that message to any of the HRs on its
SAN, using L2, expecting L3-forwarding to DA, using DA's PacketWay
address.  That HR would either (1) forward the message toward DA, and
possibly return to SA a "re-direct" message, suggesting to use, in the
future, another HR on SA's SAN for DA, or (2) report no knowledge of DA
(using the UNK error message).

Under level C nodes may be located by PacketWay-addresses, names, or
capabilities, but only addresses may be used for routing.


NODE ATTRIBUTES
+--------------

Each node has: Physical Address, Name, Capabilities, and Logical-Addresses

 Address (Physical): 3 bytes, flat, unique in this PacketWay

 Name:               flat, globally unique (e.g., IP address),
                     arbitrary length

 Capabilities:       regular GP node, router, PacketWay-server, NFS,
                     paging server, M/C server, DSP, printer, ....

                     Some capabilities may need additional parameters
                     (e.g., SAN-ID for routers, and resolution+colors
                     for printers).

		     The capabilities are defined in the Enumeration
		     Appendix (A5).

 Logical-Addresses:  a set of (logical) addresses to which this node
                     requests to listen.  Logical addresses designate
                     multicast and broadcast groups.

                     The control of the Logical-Addresses (a la IGMP)
                     is not defined in this document.  this will be
                     designed by the applications that use it (e.g.,
                     PktWay-multicast).

		     The management of logical addresses (e.g., JOIN
		     and LEAVE) is not defined yet.

		 Part-3: PacketWay RRP Message Format
		 -------------------------------------

RRP messages are PacketWay messages with PT="RRP" in their EEP-header.
The EEP-header is followed by some (zero or more) RRP-records according
to their RRP-type, followed (always) by the TAIL which is the EI field.

The RRP-records constitute the DB of the PacketWay-message.  They must
be in Big-Endians order, with e=0 in the EEP-header.

The RRP-Type is carried in the TE of the of the EEP-header.

Following are the RRP messages, with their RRP-type:

RRP MESSAGE SUBTYPES

[RDRC]        BC   Re-direct to node (address) via a neighbor HR(address)
[TELL]         C   Please tell me about node (address, name, capabilities)
		   The reply to [TELL] is [INFO], or [ERR/UNK].

[HRTO]        BC   Which HR should I use for node (address)
		   The reply to [HRTO] is [RDRC], or [ERR/UNK].

[WRU?]         C   Who/what-Are-You?
		   The reply to [WRU?] is [INFO].

RRP also uses the following error messages:

[ERR/UNK]     BC   Destination Unknown (address)
[ERR/HRDOWN]  BC   HR Down
[ERR/LKDOWN]  BC   Link Down
[ERR/GENERAL]ABC   General error message

All these messages may be sent from nodes or from HRs, to nodes or
to HRs.

The format of these messages is defined in this part.

The implementation levels are:

    Level-A: pre-wired (static) native routing, "MAC"-based operation
    Level-B: L3 forwarding (planner transfers), IP-like operation
    Level-C: Node discovery (static routing)

RRP RECORD FORMAT
+----------------

Each RRP-record starts with an 8B-word header as shown below.  Its first
byte identifies the record type (RTyp).  The second byte is the
Pad-Count byte (PL) indicating the number of padding bytes.  The third
and the fourth bytes (RL) are the length (in 8B-words) of the record,
excluding the record header, hence it may be zero.  The rest of the
header bytes depend on the record type (RTyp).

+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|  RTyp  |   PL   |       RL        |        |        |        |        |Record
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

Some records that have an arbitrary length are "right justified" and
have PL padding bytes before the data.  Padding Before Data [PBD].    

Some records that have an arbitrary length are "left justified" and
have PL bytes after the data.  Padding After Data [PAD].

In either case the total number of data bytes is: (8*RL-PL-4).

Following are the RRP-records.  These records are the building blocks
used to construct RRP-messages.

In the following xxx indicate bytes that are discarded, such as for
padding.  It is recommended to set them to all-0.


===> [ADDR] Node-Address Record [PAD]

This record specifies either a single address (with AT=1) or a range
of addresses (with AT=2 followed by AT=3, or by AT=4 followed by AT=5).
AT is the "Address-Type".

    0        1        2        3        4        5        6        7

+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

or:

    0        1        2        3        4        5        6        7

| "ADDR" |  PL=4  |      RL=1       |  AT=2  |    Min-PktWay-Address    |

|  AT=3  |    Max-PktWay-Address    |  xxx   |  xxx   |  xxx   |  xxx   |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
RRP-Format                        <24>                         PktWay-WG 


or:
    0        1        2        3        4        5        6        7
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| "ADDR" |  PL=4  |      RL=1       |  AT=4  |   PktWay-Address-Value   |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|  AT=5  |   PktWay-Address-Mask    |  xxx   |  xxx   |  xxx   |  xxx   |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
   The address-mask follows the address-value after 4 padding bytes.

The above addresses may be physical or logical.

The address X is specified by an ADDR record if:

if AT=1:                            X  == PktWay-Address 

if AT=2,3:   Min-PktWay-Address <=  X  <= Max-PktWay-Address 

if AT=4,5:   (PktWay-Address-Mask & X) == PktWay-Address-Value

An ADDR-record defines only one PktWay-address (or one range),
unlike an LADR record that may specify multiple addresses and
multiple address-ranges.

If the ADDR record is followed by other records that describe the same
node (such as NAME, CAPA, LADR, SRQR, and MTUR) then the RL of the ADDR
records also covers all these records.  All these records apply to all
the addresses specified in this ADDR-record.  Needless to say that NAME
is not expected to appear within a record that specifies more than one
address.

Hence, if an ADDR-record with AT=1 has RL>1, or if an ADDR-record with
AT>1 has RL>2, then this ADDR-record includes additional records (such
as CAPA, LADR, SRQR, and/or MTUR) about the specified address(es).


===> [NAME] Node-Name Record [PAD] (e.g., a name with 9 characters: A1..A9):

    0        1        2        3        4        5        6        7
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| "NAME" |  PL=3  |      RL=1       |   A1   |   A2   |   A3   |   A4   |Name
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|   A5   |   A6   |   A7   |   A8   |   A9   |  xxx   |  xxx   |  xxx   |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+


===> [CAPA] Node-Capability Record [PAD] (e.g., with 9 parameter bytes):

    0        1        2        3        4        5        6        7
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| "CAPA" |  PL=2  |      RL=1       | CC=Cx  |   P1   |   P2   |   P3   |cap
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|   P4   |   P5   |   P6   |   P7   |   P8   |   P9   |  xxx   |  xxx   |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

Byte#4 is the Capability Code, CC, followed by as many parameter bytes
as needed.
PktWay-WG                         <25>                         RRP-Format



The capability codes are listed in the Enumeration Appendix (A5).

The number of bytes used by the parameters is 8*RL-PL-5.


===> [LADR] Logical-Addresses Record [PAD] (e.g., 2 logical addresses
and a range of logical addresses):

    0        1        2        3        4        5        6        7

+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|  AT=2  |1010  Min-Logical-Address |  AT=3  |1010  Max-Logical-Address |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|  AT=1  |1010  Logical-Address-#2  |  xxx   |  xxx   |  xxx   |  xxx   |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

Whereas an ADDR-record defines only one PktWay-address (or one range),
an LADR record may specify multiple addresses (each with AT=1) and
multiple ranges (each with a pair of AT=2,3 or AT=4,5).


===> [SRQR] Source-Route Record [PBD], with Q for that route.
          (e.g., a  combined SR with 13 bytes and an SR with 4 bytes)

This record carries one, or more, L2RHs (2 in the following example). 

    1        2        3        4        5        6        7
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| "SRQR" |  PL=2  |      RL=3       |  xxx   |  xxx   |        Q        |SR+Q
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|vv000000|11 L=13B|  SR01  |  SR02  |  SR03  |  SR04  |  SR05  |  SR06  |L2RH#1
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|  SR07  |  SR08  |  SR09  |  SR10  |  SR11  |  SR12  |  SR13  |   xxx  |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
|vv000000|11 L=4B |  SR01  |  SR02  |  SR03  |  SR04  |   xxx  |   xxx  |L2RH#2
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

Q (the Route Quality) is an unsigned 16-bit integer.  The units are not
defined here.  It is assumed that it is monotonic with all-0 being the
best and all-1 the worst.  If there is an MTUR (MTU-record) for that SR
it should follow this SRQR record.  However, the RL of this SRQR does
not include the RL of the MTUR.


===> [MTUR] MTU record [PBD]:

    0        1        2        3        4        5        6        7
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| "MTUR" |  PL=0  |      RL=0       |         MTU (in 8B-words)         |MTU
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

The MTU record provides the MTU for the SR defined before (by an SRQR).

The value of 0 means indefinite MTU (i.e., any length is OK).

The INFO records aggregate all the nodes that meet any of the attributed
specified in the TELL record.  When such aggregation is used, the DL
(data length) in the PH is the sum of the RLs in all the ADDR fields.

(*) The ADDR, NAME, and CAPA records are repeated for each applicable node.
    Same also for LADR, SRQR, and MTUR, if any.

If several capabilities are specified in [TELL], any node that has any of
these capabilities should be reported in [INFO].

	 Appendix-B: Example of the use of RRP (over Myrinets)
	 -----------------------------------------------------

In this example Node1 on SAN1 (with MTU=16KB) is looking for an
automatic spectral analyzer (CC=X).  It uses TELL (s1) to ask its
default router (RTRA1, the half of RouterA connected to SAN#1) which
nodes have this capability.  RTRA1 knows about no such node, and replies
with ERROR/UNK (s2) telling Node1 that RTRA1 knows about no such node.
(The extent by which RTRA1 checks with others before sending this reply
is not specified here.)

Failing to find such analyzer, Node1 is looking for a DSP that handles
IEEE floating-point 64-bit data.  Node1 (s3) asks RTRA1 to provide the
list of floating-point DSPs that can handle 64bit IEEE data.  (s4) RTRA1
provides the addresses of both Node2 and Node3.  For its own reasons
Node1 decides to use Node2.  (s5) Node1 asks RTRA1 which router to use
for Node2.  (s6) RTRA1 suggests to use RouterB.  (s7) Node1 uses
L3-forwarding, via Router-B, to verify Node2's capabilities, by asking
Node2 for information about itself.  (s8) Node2 provides this
information which Node1 likes.  (s9) Node1 asks RouterB for L2RH(s) to
Node2.  (s10) RouterB provides the requested L2RH with its MTU of 1,024
8B-words (8KB).  Finally, (s11) Node1 starts sending data to Node2 using
L2-forwarding.  Similarly, Node2 may ask its default router which HR to
use for Node1 and for L2RH(s) to Node1.

If Node1 had only Level-A implementation then it should have the
combined L2RH from itself to RouterB and from there to Node2 pre-wired,
saving all this message exchange.

The sequence of messages is shown below.

(s1) Node1 sends a [TELL] message asking its default router (RTRA1) to
provide a list of nodes with the capability code X (CC=X).  Node1 knows
that RTRA1 is on its network, with SR={2,PW}={2,3,0}, where PW=0x0300 is
the 16-bit Myrinet-type assigned to PacketWay.  Myrinet is described
here with absolute addresses.

Again, if Node1 had only Level-A implementation then it would have
pre-wired the combined L2RH from itself to RouterB and from there to
Node2, saving all this message exchange.

All the messages shown in this appendix start with local L2 routing
bytes needed to get across either SAN1 or SAN2 (indicated with "The
L2-header needed to get from ... to ...") which are not L2RHs.  The
difference is that these bytes are in front of the packet, exposed to
the local switches, whereas the L2RHs are only exposed to
PacketWay-entities.

These local L2 routing bytes are the actual bytes required by the SANs
and likely to be consumed as the messages traverses the SAN, unlike the
L2RHs that are intact until converted to actual routing bytes.

The L2RHs start with 0b0000000011 followed by the number of routing
bytes in that L2RH, and possibly also by several bytes of padding.

		    Appendix-C: Routing Tables (RTs)
		    --------------------------------

Using only levels A, B, and C, of PktWay does not require coordination
of how routing tables (local and external/remote) are structured.
However, it is anticipated that in the future dynamic inter-SAN routing,
mapping, and resource discovery will be added to PktWay.  This appendix
discusses a recommended structure for routing tables.  It is desired
that implementors that are looking only at the Level A-C document, will
not create some arbitrary internal representation for their routing
tables, that will hamper future interoperability.  Instead, it is
expected that keeping the future need for common structures for routing
tables will lead to structures that will be easy to interoperable in the
future when the PktWay specification is extended to include dynamic
inter-SAN routing, mapping, and resource discovery.

For that purpose this section includes a discussion of routing tables
which is NOT a part of this specification.

Routing tables provide the information needed for finding SRs to
destinations specified by their addresses.  In future levels of the
PktWay specification the RTs will provide means to identify nodes also
by names and/or capabilities.

The RTs are based on "maps" for SANs prepared by "mappers", local
nodes on the SANs with maps (i.e., routing tables, LRTs) of their SANs,
obtained dynamically or statically.  The inter-SAN routing process
depends on the exchange of these maps to form local and remote RTs.

The attributes of an RT are:

    SN         Serial Number of this RT (by RCVF)
    SAN-ID     ID of the SAN which this RT describes
    RCVF       List of Received-From physical addresses or SAN-IDs (history)
    CSR+Q      Common Source Route for the entire RT and its Q
    MinMTU     Min MTU for this RT (along the above CSR)
    Local-RT   Node-Structures, for nodes on the SAN specified by this RT

The Local-RT has one or more Node-Structures for each node on the SAN
specified by this RT.

These Node-Structures are of the form:

    Address                 Physical address on this SAN
    [Name]                  Optional
    [Capabilities]          Optional
    [Logical-Address(es)]   Optional: The LA(s) to which it listens
    SR		            From the mapper to the node specified by
                                                          this structure

Each SR entry (and the CSR, too) contains Q, the quality of the SR, an
unsigned 16-bit integer.  The units are not defined yet.  It is assumed
that Q is monotonic (sort of analogous to latency, hence additive) with
all-0 being the best and all-1 the worst.  
Appendix-C                        <44>                          PktWay-WG



Until otherwise defined, let Q be an unsigned-integer in microseconds.
In updating it, its value should be clipped to the maximum value (~64msec).

The CSR has a MinMTU which is the minimal MTU along the entire CSR.

The RCVF is the list of the physical addresses along which this RT was
forwarded.  Its entries are either HR-addresses or SAN-IDs.

The purpose of the RCVF is to identify the genealogy of a composite
route.  It could be used for preventing routing loops.

The RCVF could have been derived from the CSR, if only the HRs could
parse the CSR and associate HR-addresses with SRs and SAN-IDs with
HR-addresses, which should not be assumed.

Different RTs for the same SAN may be kept.  Each RCVF has its own SN.

The Node-Structure (in an RT) has SRs from the mapper (of that RT) to
that node.  The CSR is an SR to the same mapper.  Hence, by catenating
the CSR to the beginning of the SR in the Node-Structure, an SR is
derived all the way from the local node (where the RT resides) to the
remote node.

Each SAN has a unique SAN-ID, known to the HRs on it.  The SAN-IDs share
the PacketWay-address space with the nodes.  Hence, a SAN-ID is also a
unique 24-bit physical PacketWay-address (starting with a 0 bit).

Node structure: A C-struct (or equivalent) containing values for some
		attributes of a node.

Planned Transfer: Transfer of information, occurs after an initial phase

                switches as soon as possible, without storing that
                entire packet in the switch (unlike Stop-and-forward).

Zero-copy TCP:  A TCP system that copies data directly between the user
                area and the network device, bypassing OS copies.
