                       DNS Zone Transfer over TLS
                   draft-hzpa-dprive-xfr-over-tls-01

Abstract

   DNS zone transfers are transmitted in clear text, which gives
   attackers the opportunity to collect the content of a zone by
   eavesdropping on network connections.  The DNS Transaction Signature
   (TSIG) mechanism is specified to restrict direct zone transfer to
   authorized clients only, but it does not add confidentiality.  This
   document specifies use of DNS-over-TLS to prevent zone contents
   collection via passive monitoring of zone transfers.

1.  Introduction

   DNS has a number of privacy vulnerabilities, as discussed in detail
   in [I-D.bortzmeyer-dprive-rfc7626-bis].  Stub client to recursive
   resolver query privacy has received the most attention to date.
   There are now standards track documents for three encryption
   capabilities for stub to recursive queries and more work going on to
   guide deployment of specifically DNS-over-TLS (DoT) [RFC7858] and
   DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) [RFC8484].

   [I-D.bortzmeyer-dprive-rfc7626-bis] established that stub client DNS
   query transactions are not public and needed protection, but on zone
   transfer [RFC1995] [RFC5936] it says only:

Internet-Draft                XFR over TLS                    March 2019


   "Privacy risks for the holder of a zone (the risk that someone gets
   the data) are discussed in [RFC5936] and [RFC5155]."

   In what way is exposing the full contents of a zone a privacy risk?
   The contents of the zone could include information such as names of
   persons used in names of hosts.  Best practice is not to use personal
   information for domain names, but many such domain names exist.
   There may also be regulatory, policy or other reasons why the zone
   contents in full must be treated as private.

   Neither of the RFCs mentioned in [I-D.bortzmeyer-dprive-rfc7626-bis]
   contemplates the risk that someone gets the data through
   eavesdropping on network connections, only via enumeration or
   unauthorised transfer as described in the following paragraphs.

   [RFC5155] specifies NSEC3 to prevent zone enumeration, which is when
   queries for the authenticated denial of existences records of DNSSEC
   allow a client to walk through the entire zone.  Note that the need
   for this protection also motivates NSEC5 [I-D.vcelak-nsec5]; zone
   walking is now possible with NSEC3 due to crypto-breaking advances,
   and NSEC5 is a response to this problem.

   [RFC5155] does not address data obtained outside zone enumeration
   (nor does [I-D.vcelak-nsec5]).  Preventing eavesdropping of zone
   transfers (this draft) is orthogonal to preventing zone enumeration,
   though they aim to protect the same information.

   [RFC5936] specifies using TSIG [RFC2845] for authorization of the
   clients of a zone transfer and for data integrity, but does not
   express any need for confidentiality, and TSIG does not offer
   encryption.  Some operators use SSH tunnelling or IPSec to encrypt
   the transfer data.

   Because the AXFR zone transfer is typically carried out over TCP from
   authoritative DNS protocol implementations, encrypting AXFR using
   DNS-over-TLS [RFC7858] seems like a simple step forward.  This
   document specifies how to use DoT to prevent zone collection from
   zone transfers, including discussion of approaches for IXFR, which
   uses UDP or TCP.

   Next steps: Work on open questions at DNS table during IETF 104
   Hackathon, expand this draft, then solicit discussion on the DPRIVE
   mailing list.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] and [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Privacy terminology is as described in Section 3 of [RFC6973].

   DNS terminology is as described in [RFC8499].

   DoT: DNS-over-TLS as specified in [RFC7858]

   DoH: DNS-over-HTTPS as specified in [RFC8484]

3.  Zone Transfer Confidentiality Overview

4.  Zone Transfer with DoT - Authentication

4.1.  TSIG

4.2.  Mutual TLS

5.  Session Establishment and Closing

5.1.  AXFR Sessions

   The connection flow in AXFR is a NOTIFY from the primary server to
   the secondary server, and then an AXFR request from the secondary to
   the primary after which the data flows.

   The connection for AXFR via DoT SHOULD be established using port 853,
   as specified in [RFC7858].  If there is no response on port 853, the
   connection MAY be attempted using port 443 in case the server offers
   DoT service on this port.

   TODO: diagram of connection flow for AXFR, without and with DoT

5.2.  IXFR Sessions

   [RFC1995] specifies that Incremental Transfer may use UDP if the
   entire IXFR response can be contained in a single DNS packet,
   otherwise, TCP is used.

   QUESTION: Given this, how should confidentiality of IXFR be provided?

   To discuss:



Zhang, et al.          Expires September 12, 2019               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                XFR over TLS                    March 2019


   o  should IXFR have a mode in which TCP is mandatory?

   o  should IXFR have a mode in which TLS is mandatory?

   o  In workloads where there are frequent IXFRs, is the persistent
      connection mode that TCP-Mode would enable (as well as the
      retries) a benefit?

5.3.  Policies for Both AXFR and IXFR

   In order to assure the confidentiality of the zone information,
   entire group of servers involved in XFR (the primary and all
   secondaries) MUST have a consistent policy of requiring
   confidentiality.  If any do not, this is a weak link for attackers to
   exploit.  How to do this is TBD.

   Additionally, the entire group of servers involved in XFR (the
   primary and all secondaries) MUST have a consistent policy of
   requiring Strict or Opportunistic DoT [RFC8310].  How to do this is
   TBD.

5.4.  Next Steps

   Upcoming IETF Hackathon experiments will feed into this Session
   Establishment and Closing section, as much about this needs
   exploration as well as discussion on the mailing list.

6.  Performance Considerations

   The details in [RFC7858] and [RFC8310] about e.g. using persistent
   connections and TLS Session Resumption [RFC5077] are fully applicable
   to DNS Zone Transfer over DoT as well.

7.  Implementation Considerations

   TBA

8.  IANA Considerations

   TBD

9.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies a security measure against a DNS risk: the
   risk that an attacker collects entire DNS zones through eavesdropping
   on clear text DNS zone transfers.  It presents a new Security
   Consideration for DNS.  Some questions to discuss are: should DoT in

   this new case be required to use only TLS 1.3 and higher to avoid
   residual exposure?  How should padding be used (if it should)?
