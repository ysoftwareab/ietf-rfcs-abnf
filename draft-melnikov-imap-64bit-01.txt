1.  Introduction

   IMAP [RFC3501] only allows body parts or message sizes which are 32
   bit.  This document introduces an IMAP extension that allows for
   message and body part sizes to be 63 bit.

   The client wishing to use this extension MUST issue ENABLE 64BIT.
   Refer [RFC5161] for the usage of ENABLE command.

2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.  If a single "C:" or "S:" label applies to
   multiple lines, then the line breaks between those lines are for
   editorial clarity only and are not part of the actual protocol
   exchange.

Internet-Draft 64bit body part and message sizes in IMAP4   October 2016


3.  64bit Extension

   An IMAP server that supports the 64bit extension advertises this by
   including the name 64BIT in its CAPABILITY list in the authenticated
   state.  The server may also advertise this extension before the user
   has logged in.  If this capability is omitted, no information is
   conveyed about the server's status of supporting this extension.

   IMAP server should respond with BAD response for the 64bit message
   size messages sent by the IMAP client unless it issues "ENABLE 64BIT"
   in the current connection.

4.  IMAP Protocol Changes

   TBD.

5.  Examples

   C: t1 CAPABILITY
   S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 ID 64BIT
   S: t1 OK foo
   C: t2 ENABLE 64BIT
   S: * ENABLED 64BIT
   S: t2 OK foo

6.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [ABNF].

   Non-terminals referenced but not defined below are as defined by
   [RFC3501].

   All alphabetic characters are case-insensitive.  The use of upper or
   lower case characters to define token strings is for editorial
   clarity only.  Implementations MUST accept these strings in a case-
   insensitive fashion.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to add "64BIT" to the IMAP Capabilities registry, using
   this document as its reference.
