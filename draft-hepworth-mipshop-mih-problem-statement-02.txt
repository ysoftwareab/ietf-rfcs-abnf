   802.21.  Intelligent access selection, taking into account link layer
   attributes, requires the delivery of a variety of different
   information types to the terminal from different sources within the
   network and vice-versa.  The protocol requirements for this
   signalling have both transport and security issues that must be
   considered.  The signalling must not be constrained to specific link
   types, so there is at least a common component to the signalling
   problem which is within the scope of the IETF.  This draft presents a
   problem statement for this core problem.

Internet-Draft            MIH Problem Statement                June 2006


1.  Introduction

   This Internet Draft provides a problem statement for the exchange of
   information to support handover in heterogeneous link environments.
   This mobility support service allows more sophisticated handover
   operations by making available information about network
   characteristics, neighbouring networks and associated
   characteristics, indications that a handover should take place, and
   suggestions for suitable target networks to which to handover.  The
   mobility support services work complementarily with IP mobility
   mechanisms to enhance the overall performance and usability
   perception.

   There are two key attributes to the handover support service problem
   for inter-technology handovers:

   1.  The Information and Information Exchange mechanism: this includes
       the information elements or data that describe the information,
       and any signalling exchanges that are required to support the
       transfer of this data.  IEEE 802.21 WG has undertaken this
       problem of defining the protocol semantics, data formats in a
       manner that is independent of transport which carries this
       information.

   2.  The Underlying Transport: this supports the above Information
       Exchange between devices in the network.  The requirements on
       this transfer mechanism include transport issues, because of the
       volume of data to be sent, as well as discovery and security
       issues for this transport, as the signalling may cross
       administrative boundaries and is interdependent with AAA aspects.

   This draft has been motivated by on-going work within IEEE 802.21,
   but the following description intentionally describes the problem
   from a more general perspective.  This document represents the views
   of the IEEE 802.21 WG and presents official requirements for an IP
   transport to support the Information Exchange discussed above.

   The structure of this document is as follows.  Section 2 provides a
   brief overview of the mobility handover services as defined in IEEE
   802.21.  Section 4 provides a simple model for the protocol entities
   involved in the signalling and their possible relationships.
   Section 5 describes a decomposition of the signalling problem into
   service specific parts and a generic transport part.  Section 5.2
   describes more detailed requirements for the transport component.
   Section 5.4 provides security considerations, and Section 5.5
   summarizes the conclusions and open issues.

2.  Introduction to IEEE 802.21

   At this time, three broad classes of services for handover
   assistance, particularly aiming at improving the inter-technology,
   are under consideration within the IEEE 802.21 Working Group [1].
   They require passing of information within hosts, locally and between
   different hosts, remotely.  The services are Information Services
   (IS), Event Services (ES) and Command Services (CS).

2.1.  Information Services

   Information Services (IS) are one part of handover services used to
   provide network related information about the current or neighboring
   networks with same or different access link technology.  This allows
   the network or host to make informed decisions of which network to
   handover to or handover operations to undertake either in response to
   certain events, or when planning controlled or commanded handovers.
   The IS work complementary to the mobility management protocols in the
   capacity that they are utilized before making decisions for handovers
   in the aspect of network selection.

2.2.  Event Services

   Event Services (ES) provide indications from one layer or one
   functionality to another about status changes in the connectivity
   state.  This is particularly relevant to wireless interfaces.  It
   should be noted that the events of one link technology can be carried
   over current or another link technology.  Remote event service is a
   protocol exchange mechanism between two different network nodes to
   inform of ES.  The event notification can originate either from a
   mobile node or a node in the network.  Receipt and processing of an
   event belonging to the ES may generate a reaction in the receiving
   node (e.g. trigger IP layer mobility).

2.3.  Command Services

   Command Services (CS) provide mechanisms for controlling handovers or
   functions aiding handovers either locally or between two functions.
   They provide mechanisms to establish, redirect, or remove state in
   either the network or mobile node, so that handovers occur smoothly.
   Remote command service is a protocol exchange mechanism between
   network nodes to instruct the recipient network nodes to execute a
   specific function.  Execution of a command service at the mobile node
   or a node in the network may result in loss of current link
   connectivity and/or change in the network point of attachment.
   Receipt and processing of a command belonging to the CS generates an
   expected response in the receiving node (e.g. create a new link layer
   connection, disconnect a link layer connection, etc).

3.  Protocol Entities

   The following section provides an overview of the network entities
   that is expected to be involved in the signalling exchanges to
   support the handover operation.  The following abbreviations are used
   in this section:

   o  MN: mobile node

   o  NN: network node, intended to represent some device in the network
      (the location of the node e.g. in the access network, home network
      is not specified, and for the moment it is assumed that they can
      reside anywhere).

   o  EP: endpoint, intended to represent the terminating endpoints of
      the transport protocol used to support the signalling exchanges
      between nodes.

   o  MME: A Mobility Management Entity implements network selection and
      handover decision algorithms and utilizes mobility signaling
      protocols and other protocols that aid in mobility functions.


4.  Deployment Scenarios

   The deployment scenarios are outlined in the following sections.
   Note: while MN-to-MN signalling exchanges are theoretically possible,
   these are not currently being considered, and are out-of-scope.

   The following scenarios are discussed for understanding the overall
   problem of transporting MIH protocol and is not intended to show the
   scenarios are part of the requirements in the transport design.

4.1.  End-to-End Signalling and Transport over IP

   In this case, the end-to-end signalling used to exchange the handover
   information elements (the Information Exchange) runs end-to-end
   between MN and NN.  The underlying transport is also end-to-end

   Figure 1: End-to-end Signalling and Transport

4.2.  End-to-End Signalling and Partial Transport over IP

   As before, the Information Exchange runs end-to-end between the MN
   and the second NN.  However, in this scenario, some other transport
   means is used from the MN to the first NN, and the transport over IP
   is used only between NNs.  This is analogous to the use of EAP end-
   to-end between Supplicant and Authentication Server, with an upper-
   layer multihop protocol such as RADIUS used as a backhaul transport
   protocol between an Access Point and the Authentication Server.

   Figure 2: Partial Transport

4.3.  End-to-End Signalling with a Proxy

   In the final case, a number of proxies are inserted along the path
   between the two transport endpoints.  The use of proxies is possible
   in both cases 1 and 2 above, but distinguished here as there are a
   number of options as to how the proxy may behave with regard to the
   transport and end-to-end signalling exchange.

   In this case, the proxy performs some processing on the Information
   Exchange before forwarding the information on.  This can be viewed as
   concatenating signalling exchanges between a number of EPs.

              \---------------/     \----------------/

   Figure 3: Information Exchange Approach

   The Proxy NN processes all layers of the protocol suite in the same
   way as an ordinary EP.

   There is a possibility for realizing other proxy scenarios.


5.  Solution Components

   Figure 4 shows a model where the Information Exchanges are
   implemented by a signalling protocol specific to a particular
   mobility service, and these are relayed over a generic transport
   layer (the Mobility Service Transport Layer).

   Figure 4: Handover Services over IP

   The Mobility Service Transport Layer provides certain functionality
   (outlined in Section 5.2) to the higher layer mobility support
   services in order to support the exchange of information between
   communicating mobility service functions.  The transport layer
   effectively provides a container capability to mobility support
   services, as well as any required transport and security operations
   required to provide communication without regard to the protocol
   semantics and data carried in the specific mobility services.

   The Mobility Support Services themselves may also define certain
   protocol exchanges to support the exchange of service specific
   Information Elements.  It is likely that the responsibility for
   defining the contents and significance of the Information Elements is
   the responsibility of other standards bodies other than the IETF.
   Example mobility services include the Information Services, Event and
   Command services.

5.1.  Payload Formats and Extensibility Considerations

Internet-Draft            MIH Problem Statement                June 2006


   The format of the Mobility Service Transport Protocol is as follows:

   +----------------+----------------------------------------+
   |Mobility Service|           Opaque Payload               |
   |Transport Header|     (Mobility Support Service)         |
   +----------------+----------------------------------------+

   Figure 5: Protocol Structure

   The opaque payload encompasses the Mobility Support Service
   information that is to be transported.  The definition of the
   Mobility Service Transport Header is something that is best addressed
   within the IETF.

   There are a number of issues with regard to the Mobility Support
   Service header and payload definition.  These include:

   1.  Responsibility for defining the header: where should the contents
       of the Mobility Support Service header be defined, and should
       there be one or multiple header definitions (i.e. will a common
       header definition for all mobility support services be
       adequate?).  Where there are commonalities, it may indicate that
       these aspects should actually be included in the Mobility Service
       Transport Header.

   2.  Payload Format: the format or the Mobility Support Service Data
       payload could be represented in a number of formats, e.g.  TLV,
       ASN/1, XML or text.  Ideally, a single payload representation
       should be defined, as support for multiple formats leads to
       unnecessary complexity.  It is expected that a set of Data
       Objects will be defined for the Mobility Support Services to
       exchange.

   3.  Sharing of Data Objects: which refers to sharing the definitions
       of Data Objects between Mobility Support Services, e.g. if a
       Capabilities object is defined that is used by multiple Mobility
       Support Services, should the same definition be used by all of
       them.  If this is the case, then a common identifier space is
       needed to identify the different Data Objects.  There is a
       question about where the definition of Data Objects and the
       management of the identifier space should take place.

   The answers to some of the above issues may in part depend on how
   many standards groups are interested in defining their own Mobility
   Support Services.

5.2.  Official IEEE 802.21 Requirements for IP-based transport

   o  The transport protocol must work regardless of the network
      location of the MIH Protocol Entity e.g. on the same subnet, or
      deep in the network belonging to same or different IP
      administrative domain.

      (NAT) traversal for IPv4 networks.

   o  The transport protocol must enable Firewall pass-through for IPv4
      and IPv6 networks.

   o  The discovery protocol must work regardless of the network

   o  The security mechanism may provide means to reuse or fast
      reestablishment the SA due to host mobility.

5.3.  Other Considerations on the Mobility Service Transport Layer

   The following section outlines some of other considerations for
   design of the Mobility Service Transport Protocol.  Analysis within
   IEEE 802.21 has suggested that at least the following need to be
   taken into account:

   Congestion Control: A Mobility Service may wish to transfer large
      amounts of data, placing a requirement for congestion control in
      the transport.  There is an interaction between this requirement
      and that of the requirement for low latency since ways to deal
      with timely delivery of smaller asynchronous messages around the
      larger datagrams is required (mitigation of head of line blocking
      etc.).

   Multiplexing: The transport service needs to be able to support
      different mobility services.  This may require multiplexing and
      the ability to manage multiple discovery operations and peering
      relationships in parallel.

   Multihoming: For some information services exchanged with the MN,
      there is a possibility that the request and response messages can
      be carried over two different links e.g. a handover command
      request is on the current link while the response could be
      delivered on the new link.  Depending on the IP mobility
      mechanism, there is some impact on the transport option for the
      mobility information services.  This may potentially have some
      associated latency and security issues, for example, if the
      transport is over IP there is some transparency but Mobile IP may
      introduce additional delay and both TCP and UDP must use the
      permanent address of the MN.

   In addition to the above, it may be necessary for the transport to

Internet-Draft            MIH Problem Statement                June 2006


   support multiple applications (or modes of operation) to support the
   particular requirements of the Information Exchange being carried out
   between nodes.  This may require the ability to multiplex multiple
   information exchanges into a single transport exchange.

5.4.  Security Considerations

   Network supported mobility services aim at improving decision making
   and management of dynamically connected hosts.  The control and
   maintenance of mobile nodes becomes challenging where authentication
   and authorization credentials used to access a network are
   unavailable for the purpose of bootstrapping a security association
   for handover services.

   Information Services may not require authorization of the client, but
   both event and command services must authenticate message sources,
   particularly if they are mobile.  Network side service entities will
   typically need to provide proof of authority to serve visiting
   devices.  Where signalling or radio operations can result from
   received messages, significant disruption may result from processing
   bogus or modified messages.  The effect of processing bogus messages
   depends largely upon the content of the message payload, which is
   handled by the handover services application.  Regardless of the
   variation in effect, message delivery mechanisms need to provide
   protection against tampering, and spoofing.

   Sensitive and identifying information about a mobile device may be
   exchanged during handover service message exchange.  Since handover
   decisions are to be made based upon message exchanges, it may be
   possible to trace an user's movement between cells, or predict future
   movements, by inspecting handover service messages.  In order to
   prevent such tracking, message confidentiality should be available.
   This is particularly important since many mobile devices are
   associated with only one user, as divulgence of such information may
   violate the user's privacy.  Additionally, identifying information
   may be exchanged during security association construction.  As this
   information may be used to trace users across cell boundaries,
   identity protection should be available if possible, when
   establishing SAs.

   In addition, the user should not have to disclose its identity to the
   network (any more than it needed to during authentication) in order
   to access the Mobility Support Services.  For example, if the local
   network is just aware that an anonymous user with a subscription to
   operatorXYX.com is accessing the network, the user should not have to
   divulge their true identity in order to access the Mobility Support
   Services available locally.

   Finally, the network nodes themselves will potentially be subject to
   denial of service attacks from MNs and these problems will be
   exacerbated if operation of the mobility service protocols imposes a
   heavy computational load on the NNs.  The overall design has to
   consider at what stage (e.g. discovery, transport layer
   establishment, service specific protocol exchange) denial of service
   prevention or mitigation should be built in.

5.5.  Conclusions and Open Issues

   This Internet draft outlined a broad problem statement for the
   signalling of information elements across a network to support media
   independent handover services.  In order to enable this type of
   signalling service, a need for a generic transport solution with
   certain transport and security properties were outlined.  Whilst the
   motivation for considering this problem has come from work within
   IEEE 802.21, a desirable goal is to ensure that solutions to this
   problem are applicable to a wider range of mobility services.

   It would be valuable to establish realistic performance goals for the
   solution to this common problem (i.e. transport and security aspects)
   using experience from previous IETF work in this area and knowledge
   about feasible deployment scenarios.  This information could then be
   used as an input to other standards bodies in assisting them to
   design mobility services with feasible performance requirements.

   Much of the functionality required for this problem is available from
   existing IETF protocols or combination thereof.  This document takes
   no position on whether an existing protocol can be adapted for the
   solution or whether new protocol development is required.  In either
   case, we believe that the appropriate skills for development of
   protocols in this area lie in the IETF.

Appendix A.  Enabling Event and Command Services

   This section analyzes the feasibility of remote events and commands,
   and describes a set of requirements to enable remote ES and CS.  The
   section discusses some potential solutions to solve some issues
   typically associated with remote events and explicit signaling.
   However, such solutions are discussed just to provide example of how
   drawbacks and limitations identified e.g. in [2] can be overcome.
   This draft does not propose any specific solutions.

   [2] contains a set of observations on requirements that solutions
   need to fulfill to justify and enable transport of events between
   peer entities over the media (e.g. wireless link).  This section
   addresses these observations in order to assess the feasibility of
   remote ES and CS.

A.1.  Explicit Signaling for Remote Event/Command Services

   [2] indicates that alternatives not requiring explicit signaling are
   preferred, and that explicit signaling proposals must prove that
   existing explicit signaling mechanisms are inadequate.

   Implicit signaling (e.g. path change processing and link-aware
   routing metrics) has been considered for the scenarios described in
   this draft.  However, implicit signaling may not work in several
   cases of inter-technology handover.  As an example, in certain
   scenarios the handover is executed but the mobile node does not move
   between subnets (e.g. in 3GPP networks where the GGSN and the PDG are
   located in the same subnet).  In other scenarios, explicit signaling
   is required between the mobile node and a network node to report
   events related to an access link different from the one currently
   being used by the mobile node (e.g. a mobile node using a 3GPP link
   detects the availability of a WLAN link).  Such events would not be
   visible to the network node without explicit signaling.

   Various wireless technologies already have defined mobility
   management solutions that deploy explicit signaling to support
   handover (e.g. 3GPP, 3GPP2, IEEE 802.16, etc.), or are at present
   developing new solutions (e.g.  IEEE 802.11 Fast BSS Transition).
   However, such solutions are clearly defined for intra-technology
   handover (e.g. 3GPP solutions apply to handover between 3GPP
   technologies).  However, none of these wireless technologies has
   defined a solution that is applicable to inter-technology handover
   (e.g. between different IEEE 802 access links, or between a 3GPP
   access link and an IEEE 802 access link).

A.2.  Mitigation of Security Issues and Validation of  Transported
      Indications

   The validity of the information delivered through explicit signaling
   in the Remote Event Service and the Remote Command Service is
   essential to guarantee that the mobile node or the network node make
   handover decision and perform handover based on valid conditions.  In
   [2] the issue of validity of the indications is correctly raised,
   since in a generic model the receiver of the indication (e.g. the
   mobile node) may not have the ability to verify if the indication has
   e.g. been sent by a host off the actual path in use, and therefore
   possibly not capable of providing accurate indications.

   With the specific model for Remote Event Services and Remote Command
   Services briefly described in this document and IEEE 802.21 [1], a
   "relationship" is generated between the mobile node and an MME
   through a process of discovery and registration.  Authentication can
   be part of such process (possibly mutual authentication), as
   described in the security considerations.  Considering this specific
   model, information in Remote Event Service and Remote Command Service
   are generated by a node with which the recipient of the Remote Event
   Service and Remote Command Service has setup a relationship before
   hand.  It is up to the recipient to ensure during the discovery and
   registration process that the source of Remote Event Service and
   Remote Command Service is reputable and can provide accurate
   information.  An example of how this can be achieved is based on
   authentication mechanisms and the adoption of a trust model similar
   to those adopted in current networks for authentication of roaming
   users.  The mobile node can authenticate with a home domain/network
   based on a subscription with such domain/network.  If the MME is
   located e.g. in the home network, the MME can authenticate with the
   MME based on credentials the mobile node possesses as a result of the
   subscription.  If the MME is e.g. in the visited domain, a transitive
   trust model can be adopted, where the mobile node authenticates with
   the home domain/network based on a subscription and through the
   visited domain.  As a result, a security association is established
   between the mobile node and the MME.  A model similar to the one
   adopted in AAA can be adopted.

A.3.  Mapping of Identifiers

   [2] raises a legitimate issue regarding the fact that typically the
   IP layer, the link layer, the transport layer and the application
   layer use different identifiers, and therefore reporting of
   information regarding these layers to a remote node may require
   matching the various identifiers.

Internet-Draft            MIH Problem Statement                June 2006


   When local event services generate indications within a host (e.g.
   the mobile node), the host has detailed knowledge of the various
   identifiers used at the different layers (e.g. the IP address, the
   MAC addresses for the various IEEE 802 accesses, etc.).  As depicted
   in figure 12, an MIHF located in the mobile node can maintain a local
   mapping of the various identifiers.  When the mobile node discovers
   and registers with another network node (e.g. an MME), an identifier
   specific to Remote Event Services and Remote Command Services can be
   adopted to uniquely identify the mobile node , e.g. a Media
   Independent Host Identifier.  The Media Independent Host Identifier
   can be e.g. assigned to the mobile node by the home network as part
   of a set of subscription credentials.  The Media Independent Host
   Identifier could be a new identifier, or an existing identifier could
   be reused (e.g.  NAI).  Subsequently, all the remote even
   notifications and remote command exchanges can be based on the Media
   Independent Host Identifier, therefore limiting the need to maintain
   the mapping between different identifiers at different layers local
   to the host.
