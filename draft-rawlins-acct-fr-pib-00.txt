Abstract 
     This document establishes a flexible PIB framework for accounting. 
     The accounting framework accommodates usage related data for 
     accounting purposes needed for a wide variety of emerging 
     technologies. The framework is re-usable and can be extended with 
     additional accounting PIB modules to make it specific to certain 
     client types.  
      
     This document also contains examples of an accounting framework 
     PIB module and an accounting PIB for diffserv.

1 Introduction  
    
     The purpose of this document is to establish a flexible PIB 
     framework for usage by accounting. The goals of the accounting 
     framework PIB are:  
     1) To accommodate usage related data for accounting purposes 
     relevant to the emerging technologies such as VPN as well as 
     supporting existing technologies such as AAA, and DiffServ.  
     2) To make efficient use of network resources by optimizing usage 
     data formats and messaging.  
     3) To bound the scope of this framework to the network resource 
     usage monitored and recorded by the PEP and collected at the PDP. 
     The charging and billing models as well as other accounting events 
     detectable by the PDP are beyond the scope of this framework.  
     4) To re-use the existing framework PIB as much as possible.  
     5) To provide an example Accounting Usage PIB module.  
    
    
2 General Concepts  
     
2.2 Overview  
     
2.2.1 Normal Operation   
        
     The PDP specifies the accounting interval in the Accounting Timer 
     object that is included in the Client Accept message during 
     connection establishment. The PEP notifies the PDP of its client 
     type reporting capabilities during the initial request for 
     configuration data. The reporting capabilities supplied in the 
     initial configuration request informs the PDP of an accounting 
     interval that is different than the one specified by the PDP in 
     the Client Accept message. The PDP may decide to accommodate this 
     change or not and returns decisions accordingly. For a successful 
     requested configuration, the PDP installs accounting policy along 
     with other policy relevant for the client type. The PEP monitors 
     and records the usage as directed by the installed accounting 
     policy. The PEP sends the accounting PRID and EPD bindings in bulk 
     to the PDP via an unsolicited report. In the event the report 
     accounting data exceeds the max message size capability, the PEP 
     shall span the accounting data across messages and the PDP shall 
     be able to accommodate multiple spanned report messages. The PEP 
     provides the report with the accounting data within the interval 
     specified either in the Accounting Timer object or reporting 
     capability PRI. Alternatively, the report accounting data may be 
     solicited. The PEP may reset measurements depending on the 
     specific usage policy.  
      
     The PDP is the collection point for the usage information 
     monitored and reported by the PEP clients within the 
     administrative domain. The PDP may also collect other accounting 
     event information that is outside the scope of this document.

Internet Draft               ACCT-FR-PIB                    July 2000 
 
 
     The PDP installs accounting configuration information which 
     describes what, when and how accounting is done. 
    
2.2.2 Failover   
        
     In the event the connection is lost between the PEP and PDP, the 
     PEP continues to track usage information until either the 
     connection is re-established or the TTL expires. Upon successful 
     reconnection, if the PEP has cached decisions and accounting data, 
     it provides the PDP with the accounting PRI's in bulk via an 
     unsolicited report accounting message. The PEP sends the report as 
     part of its response to the state synchronization request from the 
     PDP.  
 
2.2.3 Context  
    
     The accounting policy is defined specific to a client type, i.e. 
     QoS. The accounting PIB modules are associated with other PIB 
     modules related to the client type. If the context of a client 
     type switches, then the corresponding accounting policy changes as 
     well. The PEP tracks and records usage per accounting policy 
     defined by the active PIB instance. The PEP should retain the 
     accounting data for the inactive contexts. 
      
     When the PDP issues the DEC Request State Remove which initiates a 
     context switch, the PEP responds with any existing accounting 
     policy active for that handle prior to issuing a DRQ to delete the 
     request state.  
      
2.2.4 Delete Request States  
    
   The PEP sends any outstanding accounting data monitored during the 
   interval to the PDP via an unsolicited report prior to issuing a 
   Delete Request State.  
          
      
3 Definition Structure  
      
     Accounting PIB modules adhere to the definitions provided by the 
     Framework Policy Information Base and the Structure of Policy 
     Provisioning Information documents.  
      
          
3.1 Usage for Accounting PIB Modules  
      
     The PEP defines accounting capabilities via the accounting PIB 
     modules. In general, the accounting capabilities define the 
     reporting interval limitations and describe the nature of 
     reporting, i.e. solicited or unsolicited. The PDP is notified of 
     the reporting characteristics such as the specific PRC or active 
     reporting context via the policy framework PRCs PrcSupportTable, 
     PIBIncarnationTable, and DeviceIdentificationTable.

3.2 Periodic nature of report accounting  
          
     The PDP informs the PEP of the accounting interval using the 
     Accounting Timer object in the Client Accept message during client 
     connection establishment. The PEP notifies the PDP of its 
     accounting interval capabilities during the initial configuration 
     request via the accounting capabilities PRC that is defined for 
     the respective accounting module. The PDP decides whether the 
     PEP's accounting capabilities are satisfactory. The PDP may 
     specify accounting intervals in the specific accounting policies 
     per the PEP's indicated capabilities.  
      
     Generally the accounting policy is periodic in nature and the 
     reporting is unsolicited. The unsolicited reports are supplied 
     within the interval decided by the PDP. Note that periodic 
     unsolicited reports (as dictated by timer intervals) use a 
     deterministic amount of network resources.  
      
     There may be instances where the nature of the accounting policy 
     for a given client type or accounting PIB module is such that it 
     is useful for the PDP to control when it receives the feedback. 
     The PDP may therefore have the capability to solicit the 
     accounting report.  
          
4 The Accounting Framework PIB 
 
4.1 Summary of the Accounting Framework PIB 
    
     The Accounting Framework PIB contains three PRCs intended to 
     gather accounting data related to a particular device. 
      
     The Reporting Capability Table 
     This table contains exactly one row. It defines the minimum 
     reporting interval in seconds that the PEP can support. This value 
     is reported to the PDP along with other device capabilities during 
     the initial request for configuration data. 
       
     The Report Configuration Table 
     Each row of this table specifies how often a report must be sent, 
     the type of counter the PEP must maintain, and a reference to a 
     PRC to which the attributes in the row apply.  
      
     The ACE Statistics Table 
     This table maintains statistics for ACE in the qosIpAceTable of 
     the [FR-PIB]. These include the total number of packets matching 
     the ACE, the byte count of these packets and a timestamp 
     indicating when the values were last updated.

5 Example Accounting PIB Module:  
        
5.1 A simple Accounting PIB Module based on the DiffServ QoS PIB  
        
   Simple examples of an accounting framework PIB and diffserv QoS 
   accounting PIB modules are presented in the following. The example 
   diffserv QoS accounting PIB module basically reflects counts of 
   packets. This sample accounting policy monitors packet counts by 
   DSCP per Interface Type, Name and Role Combination. The total counts 
   for the period are monitored as well the as metering actions such as 
   out of profile packets being dropped or remarked are monitored.

6 Security Considerations  
        
     The accounting information is sensitive and requires that 
     authorized messaging occur between the PEP and the PDP. This 
     protection can be accomplished with IPSEC between the PEP and the 
     PDP or using the security mechanisms described in the base COPS 
     protocol.
