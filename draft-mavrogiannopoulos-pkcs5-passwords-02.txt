Internet-Draft    Internationalized passwords in PKCS#5         May 2018


1.  Introduction

   Utilizing Internationalized passwords is not known to lead to a
   consistent user experience.  US-ASCII passwords as usually preferred
   since they are unambiguously interpreted by applications, even though
   UTF-8 [RFC3629] updates US-ASCII in a backwards compatible way.

   The reason for preferring US-ASCII passwords, is the fact that UTF-8
   does not imply that strings conforming to it, are unambiguously
   unique.  There are can be various forms of the same string which may
   look identical to an observer, even though it is being represented by
   a different byte string.  The following are certain issues with using
   passwords in UTF-8.

   o  There exist various normalization forms, which result to different
      data for the same input.

   o  There is no consistent input form in diverse systems.

   o  There are various deprecated alphabets which should not be allowed
      for future compatibility.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Passwords in PKCS#5

   The existing PKCS#5 [RFC8018] methods (PBES1, PBES2, PBMAC1) treat
   passwords as an opaque string and describe the usage of ASCII and
   UTF-8 strings as a possibility of encoding them.  In the interest of
   interoperability, applications conforming to this specification
   should encode passwords in UTF-8 NFC form and SHOULD be adhering to
   the OpaqueString profile (section 4.2 of [RFC7613]).

   Note that the OpaqueString profile does not allow empty passwords.
   Since these passwords are often used in practice, applications
   conforming to this document MAY allow empty (zero-length) passwords,
   when they are not they result of the [RFC7613] processing.  That is,
   an empty string generated from any non-empty internationalized input
   MUST NOT be used.

4.  Passwords in PKCS#12

   The PKCS#12 document [RFC7292] defines the use of BMPString passwords
   (a subset of UTF-16), for its defined encryption methods.  This
   document does not add any further restrictions to the input passwords
   of these methods, however it is RECOMMENDED to use (big-endian)
   UTF-16 NFC form [NFC] when encoding the password.

   Furthermore, when the PKCS#12 container files are combined with
   methods from PKCS#5 [RFC8018], e.g., AES-CBC-Pad, the passwords
   SHOULD be adhering to the recommendations in Section 3.  In that
   case, since typically the passwords of the MacData field and the
   encrypted data match, applications which restricted the MacData
   password to BMPString set, SHOULD fail when the input password cannot
   be expressed in that set.

5.  Compatibility notes

   Note that software wishing to decrypt files with internationalized
   passwords MAY prepare to handle password encoding methods not
   adhering to this document.  The following paragraphs document
   existing practices and known bugs in popular software.

5.1.  Attempting the password in NFC

   The recommendations in the PKCS#5 document are not sufficient to
   deduce the UTF-8 input form of internationalized passwords.
   Implementations receiving an internationalized password may attempt
   decrypting using the password in UTF-8 NFC form.

5.2.  OpenSSL's incorrect password conversion

   OpenSSL versions prior to 1.1.0 had a bug which always assumed the
   input password was in the ISO8859-1 character set regardless of the
   actual character set used on the system.  This occurred because it
   attempted to convert to UTF-16 for the BMPString merely by
   alternating each byte from the input string with a zero byte to
   expand to 16 bits.

   As an example, consider a PKCS#12 file for which the password is
   intended to be the following two characters:

      U+0102 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH BREVE

      U+017B LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z WITH DOT ABOVE

   For the purpose of this example, the user is operating in a legacy
   8-bit locale using the ISO8859-2 character set.  The above two

   characters are thus provided to the application as the bytes 0xC3
   0xAF.

   The correct form of that password for PKCS#12 key derivation includes
   precisely those characters in UTF-16 big-endian form as required for
   a BMPString: the bytes 0x01 0x02 0x01 0x7B 0x00 0x00.  This is the
   correct version which any application supporting the use of files for
   certificates and keys MUST support.

   Historical versions of OpenSSL, as noted, would assume that the input
   bytes were in the ISO8859-1 character set.  So the input bytes 0xC3
   0xAF would therefore be interpreted as the two characters:

      U+00C3 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH TILDE

      U+00AF MACRON

   The BMPString used for key derivation in this case would include the
   bytes 0x00 0xC3 0x00 0xAF 0x00 0x00.

   An application in a non-ISO8859-1 locale can therefore attempt to
   decrypt such wrongly-created files by treating the input password as
   if it is a sequence of bytes in ISO8859-1 rather than the locale
   character set in which it really was provided.  The application can
   generate the BMPString by converting from ISO8859-1 to big-endian
   UTF-16, and attempt to decrypt the file by deriving the key using
   that rendition of the password.

6.  Security Considerations

   All the considerations in [RFC8018] and [RFC7292] apply.

7.  IANA Considerations

   None.
