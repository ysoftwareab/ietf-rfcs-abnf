1.  Introduction

   Generic TLDs (gTLDs) Domain Name Registries and Registrars operating
   according to an agreement with the Internet Corporation for Assigned
   Names and Numbers (ICANN), are required to follow ICANN Consensus
   Policies.

   On 2015/09/28, the ICANN Board adopted the GNSO Council Policy
   Recommendations concerning the translation and transliteration of
   contact information as presented in the "Final Report on the
   Translation and Transliteration of Contact Information Policy
   Development Process" (T&T Report, see [TTOCI]).

   The T&T Report recommends:

   1.  Contact information that has been transformed (i.e.
       transliteration or translated) must be marked as such and their
       source(s) indicated.

   This specification is intended to be used by gTLD Domain Name
   Registries and Registrars in order to support this recommendation.

2.  RDAP Conformance object

   A server that conforms to this specification MUST include the string
   literal "rdap_transformation_of_contact_information" in the
   "rdapConformance" member of the topmost JSON object of all responses
   provided by the server.

   An example of a rdapConformance data structure including this
   extension:

      "rdap_level_0",
      "rdap_transformation_of_contact_information"
     ]


3.  Transformation object class

   A transformation object class represents the transformation (i.e.
   transliteration or translation) of an entity object.

   The transformation object class uses jCard [RFC7095] to represent
   contact information, such as postal addresses, email addresses, phone
   numbers and names of organizations and individuals.  Many of the
   types of information that can be represented with jCard have no use
   in RDAP, such as birthdays, anniversaries, and gender.

   The transformation object class contains the following members:

   o  objectClassName -- the string "transformation".
   o  vcardArray -- a jCard with the entity's contact information.  The
      language property MUST be included in the jCard object in case of
      a translation in order to indicate the language that the contact
      information was translated to.
   o  sourceOfTransformation -- a string containing the source of the
      transformation.  The possible values of sourceOfTransformation
      are: registry, registrar or reseller.
   o  typeOfTransformation -- a string containing the type of the
      transformation.  The possible values of typeOfTransformation are:
      translation or transliteration.
   o  An OPTIONAL transliterationStandard -- a string containing the
      standard (e.g.  ISO 9, ISO 7098, etc.) used for the
      transliteration.  This element MUST be present if
      typeOfTransformation is transliteration.

4.  Transformations object class

   The transformations object is an array of transformation objects
   (defined in Section 3) included in an entity object.

   If a transformations object is included, the parent entity object
   MUST show the contact information as originally inputted by the user.

   The following is an example of a JSON domain object, that includes a
   transformations object, representing a forward DNS delegation point
   that might be served by a DNR.
