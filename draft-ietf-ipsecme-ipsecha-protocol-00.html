<h1><br />Protocol Support for High Availability IKEv2/IPsec<br />draft-ietf-ipsecme-ipsecha-protocol-00</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p> IKEv2 and IPsec protocols are widely used for deploying VPN. 
            In order to make such VPN highly available and failure-prone, these VPNs are implemented as IKEv2/IPsec Highly Available (HA) cluster.
            But there are many issues in IKEv2/IPsec HA cluster. The draft  "IPsec Cluster Problem Statement" enumerates all the issues encountered in
            IKEv2/IPsec HA cluster environment.
</p>
<p> This draft proposes an extension to IKEv2 protocol to solve main issues of "IPsec Cluster Problem Statement" in Hot Standby cluster 
            and gives implementation advice for other issues. The main issues to be solved are: </p>
<ul class="text">
<li> IKE Message Id synchronization : This is done by obtaining the message Id values from the peer and updating the 
            values at the newly active cluster member after the failover. 
</li>
<li> IPsec SA Counter synchronization : This is done by sending incremented values of replay counters by the newly active
            cluster member to the peer as expected replay counter value. 
</li>
</ul><p>

Introduction</h3>

<p> IKEv2 is used for deploying IPsec-based VPNs. In order to make such VPN highly available and failure-prone, these VPNs are inplemented as 
              IKEv2/IPsec Highly Available (HA) cluster. But there are many issues in IKEv2/IPsec HA cluster. The draft  "IPsec Cluster Problem Statement"
              enumerates all the issues encountered in IKEv2/IPsec HA cluster. 
</p>
<p> In case of Hot Standby cluster implementaion of IKEv2/IPsec based VPNs, the IKEv2/IPsec session gets established with the peer and the 
              active member of cluster. After that, the active member syncs/updates the IKE/IPsec SA state to the standby member of the cluster. This 
              primary SA state sync-up is done on SA bring up and/or rekey. Doing SA state synchronization/updation between active and peer member 
              for each IKE and IPsec message standby cluster is very costly, so normally its done periodically. So, when "failover" event happens in the 
              cluster, first "failover' is detected by the standby member and then it becomes active member and it takes considerable time. During the time
              of failover and standby member becoming newly active member, the peer is unaware of failover and keeps sending IKE request and IPsec packets 
              to the cluster which is allowed as per IKEv2 and IPsec windowing feature. Now, newly active member after coming up finds the mismtach in IKE message 
              id's and IPsec replay counters. Please see <a class='info' href='#sync_problem'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>IKEv2/IPsec SA Counter Synchronization Problem </span><span>)</span></a> for more details. 
</p>
<p> This draft proposes an extension to IKEv2 protocol to solve main issues of IKE message id sync and IPsec SA replay counter sync and gives 
              implementation advice for others. Here is summary of solutions provided in this draft:  
</p>
<p> IKE Message Id synchronization : This is done by obtaining the message Id values from the peer and updating the 
            values at the newly active cluster member after the failover. 
</p>
<p> IPsec SA Counter synchronization : This is done by sending incremented values of replay counters by the newly active 
             cluster member to the peer as expected replay counter value. 
</p>
<p> Though this draft describes the IKEv2/IPsec SA counter synchronisation in context of hot standby cluster. This solution can be 
               used in other scenarios where IKEv2/IPsec SA counters are mis-matched and couner sync is needed.
</p>
<p> There were some concerns about the current window sync process. The concern was to make IKEv2 window sync optional but we beleive IKEv2 window 
               sync will be mandatory. 
</p>
<p> [[ This topic needs to be discussed further on the WG mailing list. ]]

Terminology</h3>

<p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
        "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
          <a class='info' href='#RFC2119'>RFC 2119<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bradner, S., &ldquo;Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement             Levels,&rdquo; March&nbsp;1997.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2119].
</p>
<p> "SA Counter SYNC Request" is the information exchange request defined in this draft to synchronize the 
                 IKEv2/IPsec SA counter information between member of the cluster and the peer. 
</p>
<p> "SA Counter SYNC Response" is the information exchange response defined in this draft to synchronize 
                 the IKEv2/IPsec SA counter information between member of the cluster and the peer. 
</p>
<p> Below are the terms taken from  <a class='info' href='#IPsec Cluster Problem Statement'>[IPsec Cluster Problem Statement]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nir, Y., &ldquo;IPsec Cluster Problem Statement,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> with added information 
                in context of this draft. 
</p>
<p> "Hot Standby Cluster", or "HS Cluster" is a cluster where only one of  the members is active at any one time. 
                 This member is also referred  to as the "active", whereas the other(s) are referred to as "standbys".  
                  VRRP ([RFC5798]) is one method of building such a cluster. The goal of Hot Standby Cluster is that it
                  creates illusion of single virtual gateway to the peer(s). 
</p>
<p> "Active Member" is the primary member in the Hot Standby cluster. It is responsible for forwarding packets
                for the virtual gateway. 
</p>
<p> "Standby Member" is the primary backup router. The member takes control i.e. becomes active member after
                 the "failover" event. 
</p>
<p> "Peer" is the IKEv2/IPsec endpoint which establishes VPN connection with Hot Standby cluster. The Peer 
                 knows Hot Standby Cluster by single cluster's IP address. In case of "failover", the standby member of the
                 cluster becomes active, so the peer normally doesn't notice that "failover" has occured in the cluster. 
</p>
<p> The generic term IKEv1/IPsec SA counters is used throughout. By IKEv2 SA counter stands for IKEv2 message ids
                  and IPsec SA counter stands for IPsec SA replay counters which are used to provide optional anti-replay feature.

<li>   3.8.  Different IP addresses for IKE and IPsec
</li>
<li>  3.9.  Allocation of SPIs
</li>
</ul><p>
    
</p>
<p> This draft solves the main issues using the protocol extention,
 and provides implementation advice for other issues, given as follows.

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>3.2 This section mentions that  there's lots of state that needs to be synchronized. 
If state is not synchronized, it's not really an interesting cluster - failover will be just like a 
reboot, so the issue need not be solved with protocol extensions. 
</li>
<li>3.3, 3.4,3.5, and 3.6 are solved by this draft. Please see <a class='info' href='#sync_problem'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>IKEv2/IPsec SA Counter Synchronization Problem </span><span>)</span></a>, 
     for more details. 
</li>
<li>3.7 is  the problem to be solved while building clusters.  
        However,  the peers should be mandated to accept multiple parallel SAs for 3.7.1 
</li>
<li> 3.8 can be solved by using IKEv2 Redirect Mechanism [RFC-5685].
</li>
<li>3.9 is the problem about avoiding collision of same SPI's among the cluster members. This 
is outside the scope of the document since this has to be solved within the context of the cluster and
not with the peer.

IKEv2/IPsec SA Counter Synchronization Problem </h3>

<p>  IKEv2 RFC states that "An IKE endpoint MUST NOT exceed the peer's stated window size for
        transmitted IKE requests".
</p>
<p>As per the protocol, all IKEv2 packets follows request-response paradigm. 
        The initiator of an IKEv2 request MUST retransmit the request, until it has received a response from the peer.
        IKEv2 introduces a windowing mechanism that allows multiple requests to be outstanding at a given point of time, but mandates
        that the sender window does not move until the oldest message sent from one peer to another is acknowledged.
        Loss of even a single packet leads to repeated retransmissions followed by an IKEv2 SA teardown if the retransmissions are unacknowledged.
</p>
<p> IPsec Hot Standby Cluster is required to ensure that in case of failover of active member, the standby member becomes active immediately.
        The standby member is expected to have the exact values of message id fields of active member before failover.
        Even with the best efforts to update the message Id values from active to standby member, the values at standby 
        member can be stale due to following reasons:

<li> Standby member is unaware of the last message that was received and acknowledged by the 
          older active member as failover could have happened before the standby could be updated.
</li>
<li> Standby member does not have information about on-going unackowledged requests of active member before the failover event.
              So after failover event when standby member becomes active, it can not re-transmit those requests.
</li>
</ul><p>
         
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> When a standby member takes over as the active member, it would start the message id ranges from previously updated values.
        This would make it reject requests from the peer, since the values would be stale.
        As a sender, the standby member may end up reusing a stale message id which will cause the peer to drop the request.
        Eventually there is a high probability of the IKEv2 and corresponding IPsec SAs getting torn down simply because of a 
        transitory message id mismatch and re-transmission of requests.  This is not a desirable feature of HA. Even after updating 
        standby memeber periodically the cluster can loose IKE and so all IPsec SA due to message id i.e. SA counter mismatch. 
</p>
<p>Similar issue is observed in IPsec counters also if anti-replay protection/ESN is implemented. Even with the best efforts of syncing the ESP and AH SA counter numbers from
active to stand by member , there is a chance that the stand-by member would have stale counter values. The standby member would then send the stale counter numbers.
The peer would reject such packets since in case of anti-replay protection feature, duplicate use of counters are not allowed. In case of IPsec it is ok to skip 
some counter values and start with the highr counter values.
</p>
<p>Hence a mechanism is required in HA to ensure that the standby member has correct values of message Id values and IPsec counters, 
        so that sessions are not torn down just because of window ranges.

IKEv2/IPsec SA Counter Synchronization Solution</h3>

<p>After the standby member becomes the active member after failover event in the cluster, the standby member 
        would send an authenticated IKEv2 request to the peer to send its values of SA counters.
</p>
<p> The standby member would then update its values of SA counters and then start sending/receiving the requests.
</p>
<p> The peer MUST negotiate its ability to support SA counter synchronization information with active member by sending the 
            SYNC_SA_COUNTER_INFO_SUPPORTED notification in IKE_AUTH exchange. 
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

</pre></div>
<p> When peer and active member both support SA counter synchronization, the active member MUST sync/update SA counter 
               synchronization capability to the standby member after the establishment of the IKE SA. So that standby member is aware of 
               the capability and can use it when it becomes the active member after failover event.
</p>
<p>  After failover event, when the standby member becomes the active member, it has to request the peer for the SA counters.
                Standby member would initiate the SYNC Request with an INFORMATIONAL exchange containing the notify SYNC_SA_COUNTER_INFO.
                The SYNC_SA_COUNTER_INFO information can be used for update IKEv2 counters i.e. message ids and also IPsec SA replay counters. 
</p>
<p> If there are many IPsec SAs and all IPsec SA counters cannot be synchronized with a single counter sync exchange,
             then another counter sync exchange SHOULD be send for remaining IPsec SAs, but for this exchange message id would be synced 
             IKE message id after first counter sync exchnage NOT zero. 
</p>
<p>  The peer will  respond back with the notify SYNC_SA_COUNTER_INFO. The SYNC_SA_COUNTER_INFO request contains 
                NONCE data to avoid DOS attack due to replay of SA counter sync response. The Nonce data send in SYNC_SA_COUNTER_INFO
                response MUST match with nonce data sent by newly-active member in SYNC_SA_COUNTER_INFO request. If nonce data received in 
                SYNC_SA_COUNTER_INFO response does not match with nonce data sent in SYNC_SA_COUNTER_INFO request, the standby i.e. 
                newly-active member MUST discard this SYNC_SA_COUNTER_INFO response, and normal IKEv2 behaviour of re-transmitting the
                request and waiting for genuine reply from the peer SHOULD follow, before tearing down the SA becuase of re-transmits.

Step-by-Step details</h3>

by sending   SYNC_SA_COUNTER_INFO_SUPPORTED notify in AUTH Exchange.

 Stand-by Member sends its own idea of the IKE Message ID (its side)  to peer. 
</li>
<li> The peer will send its EXPECTED_SEND_REQ_MESSAGE_ID  and EXPECTED_RECV_REQ_MESSAGE_ID.
Since the message Id values received are higher than values at the stand-by member , itwould update its local values of message Id's
 with the received values.
</li>
<li>The peer should not wait for pending response  while responding with this message Id values.
 For example if window size is 5 and   peer window is 3-7  and if peer has sent requests 3, 4,5,6,7 and 
but got response only for 4,5,6,7 but not 3 then  it should send the EXPECTED_SEND_REQ_MESSAGE_ID as 
8 and should not wait for response of 3 anymore.
</li>
<li>  The peer should not wait for pending request also. For example if window size is 5 and 
 peer window is 3-7  and if peer has received requests 4,5,6,7 but not 3 then  it should send the
EXPECTED_RECV_REQ_MESSAGE_ID as 8 and should not wait for 3 anymore.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>
There can be two types of DOS attacks.

 </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>  Replay of Message SYNC Request.
   This can be countered by rate limiting the number of such requests a peer  can receive.
   The rate limiting can be done either by number or the time delay between which Message SYNC request 
can be received or both.These options are configurable. 
</li>
<li> Replay of Message SYNC Response.
   This can be countered by sending the NONCE data along with the SYNC_SA_COUNTER_INFO notify. The same  NONCE 
    data has to be returned in response.  Thus the standby member can accept the reply only for the current request.
   After it receives the response, it MUST not accept the same response again and MUST drop the response.

Interaction with other drafts</h3>

<p>
         The primary assumption of IKEv2/IPsec SA Counter Synchronization prososal is IKEv2 SA has been established between 
          active member of Hot Standby Cluster and peer, after that the failover event occurred and now standby member 
          has "become" active. It also assumes the IKEv2 SA state was synced between active and standby member of the 
          Hot Standby Cluster before the failover event.

 </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>  Session Resumption. 
          Session resumption assumes that peer i.e. client or initiator detects the need to re-establish the session. In 
          IKEv2/IPsec SA counter cynchronization, standby member which becomes active i.e. gateway or responder
          detects the need to synchronize the SA counter after the failover event. 
          Also in Hot Standby Cluster, peer establishes the IKEv2/IPsec session with single cluster's IP address, so peer normally does
          not detect the event of failover in the cluster until standby member took very long to become active and IKEv2 SA times out via
          liveness check. So, session resumption and SA counter synchronization after failover are mutually exclusive.
</li>
<li> This document describes the operation of tightly coupled clusters, which are the common way of building IPsec clusters.
          In these clusters, all members appear to the peer as one gateway, specifically they share a single IP address.
          High availability can also be provided by loosely coupled clusters (for lack of a better term), which are a group of gateways
          that do not share an IP address and do not synchronize state. 
          In this architecture, the client can use Session Resumption to fail-over from one cluster member to another. Specifically this requires:
       
<ul class="text">
<li>Support of session resumption on peers and gateways.
</li>
<li>A common session resumption ticket format on all gateways (not currently standardized).
</li>
<li>Configuration on the peers of the group of gateways that constitute the cluster.
</li>
</ul>
    
</li>
<li> Redirect.
         Redirect mechanism for load-balancing can be used during init (IKE_SA_INIT) and auth (IKE_AUTH) and after session 
         establishment. While SA counter sync is used after IKE SA has been established and failover event has occurred.
         So it is mutually exclusive with redirect during init and auth. The redirect after session established is used for timed
         or planned shutdown/maintenance. The failover event can not be detected on active member beforehand and so using 
         redirect after session establishment is not possible in case of failover. So, Redirect and SA counter synchronization 
         after failover are mutually exclusive.
    
</li>
<li> Crash detection. 
         Solves the similar problem where peer detect that cluster member has crashed based on a token. It is mutualy exclusive with HA with SA counter sync.
