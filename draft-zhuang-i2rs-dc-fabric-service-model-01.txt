   YANG Data Model for Fabric Service delivery in Data Center Network
              draft-zhuang-i2rs-dc-fabric-service-model-01

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG data model that can be used to deliver
   fabric service for users within a data center network.  This model is
   intended to be instantiated by management system.  It provides an
   abstraction of services for a fabric network to be used by users.
   However it is not a configuration model used directly onto network
   infrastructures.  It should be used combining with such as fabric
   topology data model defined in
   [I-D.zhuang-i2rs-yang-dc-fabric-network-topology] with specific
   fabric topology information to generate required configuration onto
   the related network elements to deliver the service.

1.  Introduction

   Network service provisioning is currently coupled with specific
   network topology and technology applied, which is technology and
   device oriented.

   In the area of data center, this approach makes the management
   complex due to massive network devices involved and various
   applications deployed by multiple users (also known as tenants).

   In the traditional way, the administrator has to be aware of the
   entire data center network before delivering services for users.
   When service request comes up, administrator has to divide the
   request into appropriate configurations and operations for all
   involved devices manually.  Finally, these configurations are
   deployed onto network infrastructure, which requires personnel
   skills.

Internet-Draft   YANG for Fabric Service delivery in DC       March 2017


   Actually different users share the same network infrastructure.  A
   more dynamical way to deploy and manage the network is eager to be
   found out.  Here we decompose the network management system into
   several layers in order to have network service provision more
   flexible and automatic.  Each network layer is dedicated to be
   managed.  What is more, all the layers can be combined to fulfill the
   delivery of the user's service.

   We can use three layers in data center network.  The bottom one is
   physical infrastructure with massive devices.  The middle one is
   fabric topology defined in [I-D.zhuang-i2rs-yang-dc-fabric-network-
   topology].  Unlike the physical layer, the fabric layer is used to
   display a fabric network including features and boundaries.  In the
   fabric layer, a set of fabrics can exist with each managed
   independently.  Furthermore, a bottom-up abstraction of fabric
   service is proposed to provide application centric interfaces facing
   to users which define network services regardless of beneath fabric
   topology and physical connections in the up layer.

   This document defines a YANG [RFC6020] [RFC7950] data model focusing
   on the fabric service interfaces to define user fabric network
   services regardless of specific beneath network topology and devices.
   This model defines the generic configuration for fabric services
   within DC networks.

   For example, this model can be used by the network orchestrator in
   which the fabric service interfaces are exposed.  When a service from
   user application is requested, orchestrator adopts this model
   including service information and processes it into the topology
   layer through a DC controller.  Thus a service is automatically and
   dynamically provided.

   The service data model includes three main modules:

   (a)Module "ietf-fabric-service" defines a module for user network
   service over fabric networks from the application centric view.  To
   do so, it augments general network topology model defined in [I-
   D.ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo] with logical components such as
   logical switches, logical routers as well as logical ports to carry
   network services requested by user applications.

   (b)Module "ietf-fabric-endpoint" defines a module for hosts that run
   applications and generate traffics.  The major usage of this module
   is to indicate the attachment points of a host in a user service
   network as well as in a physical network when it is initialed, so as
   to build bindings between physical layer and topology layer
   dynamically.

Internet-Draft   YANG for Fabric Service delivery in DC       March 2017


   (c) Module "ietf-fabric-capable-device" defines a module for
   configuration and operation onto network devices generated based on
   information in fabric topology and fabric service modules.

   Besides, the model "ietf-fabric-topology" defined in [I-D.zhuang-
   i2rs-yang-dc-fabric-network-topology] with topology and resource as
   well as technology information is used to work together to implement
   configurations and operations of the fabric service onto the specific
   fabric infrastructure.

2.  Concept and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.1.  Terminology

   Fabric topology: a data center network can be decomposed to a set of
   fabric networks, while each of these fabrics composes a set of
   physical nodes/links of the physical infrastructure to form a fabric
   network.  The fabric topology includes attributes of fabrics, such as
   gateway mode, involved nodes, roles of involved nodes etc al.

   Fabric Service: it is used as a service interface of fabric networks
   to users, which uses logical elements to represent network
   connections between hosts for applications, regardless of a specific
   fabric topology deployment.  Each service instance is based on a
   fabric topology, while a fabric can provide multiple service
   instances for different users, each of which is isolated to others.

   Endpoint: an endpoint represents a host, which can be a virtual
   machine on a server or a bare-metal server.

   Fabric capable device: a physical device (e.g. a switch) that
   supports fabric service and fabric topology models.

3.  Fabric service framework overview

   This draft provides a network service interface on top of fabrics
   network layer.  Users can use these network service interfaces to
   deploy their applications over a data center network automatically
   and dynamically.

   From the application centric point of view, user hosts can be
   considered to connect with other hosts through a switch if they are
   L2 reachable, alternatively, connect through a router if they are L3
   reachable simply.  So a user network can be abstracted into a logical

Internet-Draft   YANG for Fabric Service delivery in DC       March 2017


   network where L2 reachable represents logical switches connecting
   hosts and L3 reachable represents logical routers connecting
   switches.

   With this concept, a user can use appropriate logical elements to
   define their networks and configure attributes of these elements such
   as vlan id, gateway etc al.  All of these form a network service.
   For example, a fabric service diagram for a user is shown as below.

                   Figure 1: Diagram of a fabric service

   In the diagram, abstraction of network connections is focused as a
   very initial effort to abstract services for fabric-based DC
   networks.  Based on the connection, we can add other network
   appliance for which the fabric service should be extended.

3.1.  Service element

   There are four major components regarding as service elements within
   a fabric service as depicted in Figure 1.

   Logical Switch:






Zhuang, et al.         Expires September 11, 2017               [Page 5]

   Works as a switch within a logical fabric network to provide L2
   connections between hosts or to a logical router or to external
   networks.  It can be bounded to one or several physical switches.

   Logical Router:

   Works as a router to provide L3 connections between logical switches
   or to external networks.

   Logical Port:

   Provides port function on logical switches and logical routers which
   claims their connections to others.

   Endpoint:

   Represents user hosts which can be a VM or a bare-metal server.

3.2.  Functionality of connections

   There are 4 connections between elements within the fabric service
   framework listed as follows:

   C1: Endpoint attachment.  It is used by an endpoint to connect to a
   logical switch.

   C2: L2 to L3 attachment.  Interface between a logical switch and a
   logical router within the same fabric.

   C3: L3 interconnection which connects to a logical router.

   C4: L2 interconnection which connects to a logical switch in another
   fabric.

   Thinking of the functionality of different connections, a logical
   port can act as an access port (which provides C1/C4/C3 connection to
   a network element), or a service port (which provide C2 gateway
   connection) as shown in Figure 2.

                   +---------------+     +---------------+

                      Figure 2: Types of Logical port

   When a logical port is noticed as an access port, there will be a
   corresponding physical port.  In this situation, the required access
   configuration can be deployed on this physical port directly.
   However, there will be a gateway service if a logical port is noticed
   as a service port.  In this situation, the management system should
   combine the gateway function and fabric territory at fabric topology
   layer together with the gateway configuration on the service port.
   By the combination, it is easy to figure out the appropriate devices
   in the physical infrastructure and their configurations for these
   devices respectively.

4.  Fabric service model usage

4.1.  Usage architecture

   In section 3, a fabric service interface is provided for users to
   define their networks in a more concentrated and intuitive way.  To
   be detailed, when a fabric service comes, the topology manager will
   parse services into configuration/operations of specific network
   devices automatically.  In this process, service interface
   information and topology information from fabric topology defined in
   [I-D.zhuang-i2rs-yang-dc-fabric-network-topology] is needed.

   The whole process is shown in Fig.3.  Fabric service module is used
   define network services for applications maybe by an orchestration
   for example, according to the topology architecture stated in [I-
   D.draft-ietf-i2rs-usecase-reqs-summary].  The topology information
   maintenance should be done by a topology manager.  By combining

   information from different layers, a topology manager automatically
   generates configurations and operations of related devices and
   deploys them respectively over the physical fabric infrastructures.
   Here, the fabric-capable-device module can be used to configure
   involved devices.

                Figure 3: Fabric service Usage architecture

4.2.  Multi-Layer interconnection

   There are three layers in this usage.

   At the service layer, a fabric service model is abstracted from
   fabric network used as an application-centric interface to define
   user networks.  It focuses on the connection services from users'
   perspective.  Using the fabric service interface, an administrator
   can define a logical network for each user over a single fabric
   network while each logical networks can be managed separately.

   For the fabric topology layer, it collects and maintains the fabric
   topology information (including territory of the physical fabric,
   connections, gateway functions, roles of devices within the fabric
   and specific technologies for each fabric) upon the physical network
   layer.

   With information provided by both fabric service as well as fabric
   topology, a fabric topology manager will calculates and generates
   configuration and operation for involved network devices in the
   physical layer so as to distribute and deploy them onto network
   infrastructure.

   The diagram of the management architecture and its relationship is
   depicted as below.

                   Figure 4: Multi-layer interconnection

   The mapping of nodes with access logical ports is realized by
   endpoints e.g.  H1,H2 and H3 in Fig.4.  An endpoint is instantiated
   by the orchestrator to indicate the locations of a host both in the
   logical layer as well as in the physical layer, so as to deliver
   services requested from the logical port onto the physical port in a
   dynamic manner.  For H1 and H3, they are considered to connect to the
   same switch for user in the logical layer, even they attach to the
   different devices.

   Besides, gateway configuration is defined at service layer while the
   gateway mode and gateway devices (for distributed gateway, the
   gateway should be deployed on LEAF devices, while for centralized
   gateway, the configuration should be on SPINE) are defined in fabric
   topology layer.  By combing the gateway information from both layers,
   the system can automatically figure out the involved devices and
   generate appropriate configurations onto them.

5.  Design of the data model

5.1.  Fabric service module

   As explained previously, network service for user network can be
   abstracted to sets of logical switches, logical routers and logical
   ports.  Upon these logical elements, acl policies and gateway
   functions can be attached.

                      Figure 5: Fabric Service Module

   To provide a logical network topology for DC fabric network, the
   module augments the original ietf-network and ietf-network-topology
   modules:

   o  New nodes for logical switch and logical router with additional
      data objects are introduced by augmenting the "node" list of the
      network module.

   o  Termination points for logical ports are augmented with logical
      port information and its reference to termination ports in the
      underlay topologies.  As stated in section 3, the logical port may
      act as an access port which will be bounded to some physical port,
      or else it may be as a service point which connects to internal
      gateway or external gateway.  Besides, it can also be attached
      with ACL rules.

5.2.  Endpoint module

   To represent user attachments points and map logical fabric
   configurations and operations of applications onto the physical
   fabric infrastructure, an endpoint is instantiated to represent a
   host of a user that runs applications.

   The fabric endpoint module is defined by YANG module "ietf-fabric-
   endpoint".  The module is depicted as follows:

                     Figure 6: Fabric endpoint module

   By indicating locations of an endpoint in "location" container, the
   logical network elements such as logical nodes and logical
   termination points are bounded to the network elements in a specific
   fabric.  Then the network configurations and operations from the
   logical network together with its belonged fabric topology
   information will further be distributed onto the bounding/related
   physical elements by the network topology manager.

   Besides, the module defines three rpc commands to register,
   unregister and locate the endpoint onto both logical network and
   physical network shown as follows.

   The ietf-fabric-capable-device augments the generic ietf-network and
   ietf-network-topology modules with specific attributes for fabric
   services as follows:

   o  Additional data objects for nodes are introduced by augmenting the
      "node" list of the network module to carry specific fabric
      features for a fabric capable device.  New objects include type of
      supported fabric such as VXLAN fabric or VLAN fabric, supported
      capability such as whether the device supports Network Address
      Transformation or Service Function Chain functions.  Also, the
      "host" fabric is indicated to show which fabric the device
      belonged to.

   o  Besides, new objects for configuring the device are contained in
      the "config" container, which includes the L2 attributes and L3
      attributes of the bridge.

   o  Termination points are also augmented with attributes to indicate
      the role of the device port in a fabric and its role in the bridge
      network.
