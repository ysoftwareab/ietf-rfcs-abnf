Internet-Draft          112-bit Crypto for IPSEC               July 2009


1.  Introduction

   [SuiteB] defines a set of cryptographic algorithms that are secure,
   well reviewed, and are efficient at high data rates and high security
   levels.  Currently, support for Suite B is only partly available
   across the industry.  Traditionally, the adoption of new algorithms
   by the industry is a complex and slow process involving multiple
   actors, including policy makers in government and industry, standards
   organizations, and vendors of crypto software and hardware, network
   devices and software, and operating systems.  Complications around
   ownership of some intellectual property rights as also slowed
   adoption of Suite B.

   In this document, we define a suite of crypto algorithms that overlap
   with Suite B, that contains only algorithms that are believed to be
   unencumbered by intellectual property considerations and that targets
   a 112-bit security level.  This level is not as high as that of Suite
   B, but it is believed to be adequately secure to meet present
   commercial needs.  It provides a halfway point between current
   industry practice and Suite B.

   It is hoped that the adoption of this new suite will simplify and
   shorten the process of adopting Suite B while providing 112-bit
   security.

   As with previous user interface suites ("UI suites") for IPSec (see
   [RFC4308] and [RFC4869]), this document simply defines a few
   collections of algorithms for IPSec and does not modify the protocol
   itself in any way.

1.1.  Conventions Used In This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Algorithms

2.1.  Considerations

   There were four main criteria taken into consideration when
   developing the list of algorithms to be recommended:

   o  IPR licensing concerns

   o  Targeted strength equivalence of at least 112 bits of security

   o  Acceptance of algorithms by the industry and governments,
      including NIST approval of algorithms

   o  Interoperability between VPN devices

2.1.1.  Naming

   The naming of the suite of algorithms defined here is based on the
   precedent set forth in RFC4308 where the denotation of "VPN-A" and
   "VPN-B" is used.  Due to concerns over naming conflicts with
   organizations that already exist in the industry, the "VPN-C"
   designation was bypassed and therefore the suite defined here is
   referenced as "VPN-D".

2.2.  Suite D Algorithms

   For Authenticated Encryption in the data plane, AES with 128 bit keys
   in GCM mode with 128 bit ICV [RFC4106] MUST be used.

   For Integrity checks (when Authenticated Encryption is not in use),
   HMAC-SHA-256-128 [RFC4868] MUST be used.

   For hashing algorithms, SHA-256 [SHA2] MUST be used.

   For certificate based signatures, RSA-2048 and SHA-256 MUST be used.

   For Diffie-Hellman key exchanges, a 2048-bit MODP group MUST be used.
   Explicitly, Diffie-Hellman Group 14 [RFC3526] MUST be used.

   For pseudo-random generation function, PRF-HMAC-SHA-256 [RFC4868]
   MUST be used.

3.  Suite D Algorithms in IPSec

   Suite-VPN-D defines the set of algorithms intended to be used for
   IPSec VPN applications and fully complies with the MUST Suite D
   algorithms defined above.

        | Pseudo Random Function    | PRF-HMAC-SHA-256            |
        |                           |                             |
        | IKE encryption transform  | AES-CBC-128                 |
        |                           |                             |
        | IKEv1 hash                | SHA-256                     |
        |                           |                             |
        | IKEv2 integrity transform | HMAC-SHA-256-128            |
        |                           |                             |
        | IKE Diffie-Hellman Group  | 14                          |
        |                           |                             |
        | IKE X509 authentication   | RSA-2048 with SHA-256       |
        |                           |                             |
        | IKE Pre-Shared Key        | not less than 128 bits      |
        +---------------------------+-----------------------------+

                          Suite-VPN-D Cryptosuite

   For IKEv1 implementations, Main mode SHOULD be used.

   IKEv1 implementations MUST support rekeying of Phase 2.  For IKEv2
   implementations, CREATE-CHILD_SA exchanges MUST be supported.  Rekey
   operations that include the optional Diffie-Hellman key MUST use a
   key that is DH Group 14.

   If the pre-shared key option is used, then it MUST have a min-entropy
   of 128 bits.  This means that the key must be chosen at random in
   such a way that the most probable key will occur with probability no
   greater than 2^(-128).  A practical way to achieve this is to choose
   the key uniformly at random; for example, a string of 22 base64
   characters chosen uniformly at random has sufficient min-entropy.

4.  Security Considerations

   The target of 112-bit security level for the suite is generally
   believed to be sufficient for some time given current technologies
   [RFC3766].  This security level is also supported by current NIST
   recommendations for key strengths [NIST.800-57.2007].

5.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA registry called "Cryptographic Suites for IKEv1, IKEv2, and
   IPsec" should be updated with an identifier of 'VPN-D' following the
   criteria set forth in [RFC4308].

Appendix A.  Other 2048 bit MODP Groups

   In this document, we make use of Diffie-Hellman Group 14 in Suite
   VPN-D to provide 2048 bit MODP for IKE.  Diffie-Hellman Group 24
   [RFC5114] might also be considered to for this purpose.  However, the
   authors note, the prime chosen for Group 24 is not a safe prime and
   modified IKE hanlding based on public key validation routines might
   be required.
