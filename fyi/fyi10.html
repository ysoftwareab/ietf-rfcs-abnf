<h3>Abstract</h3></a>
<p>

A wealth of information exists on the network.  In fact, there is so
much information that you could spend your entire life browsing. This
paper will present some of the "gold nuggets" of information and file
repositories on the network that could be useful.
<p>

The ultimate goal is to make the route to these sources of
information invisible to you.  At present, this is not easy to do.  I
will explain some of the techniques that can be used to make these
nuggets easier to pick up so that we all can be richer.

<h3>1.0  Introduction</h3></a>
<p>

This paper is a list of the essential things, in my view, that a
people who are responsible for providing network information should
have in their hands as reference material.  One of the basic problems
with information is making it easily available to those who need the
data.  Libraries have been performing a cataloging function for many
centuries.  Information flow is now being provided so fast that it is
difficult to keep up with it, even partially. Computer networks have
only added to the problem by opening up access to even more
information.
<p>

Attempting to make this wealth of information available to those who
would find it useful poses some problems.
<p>

First, we need to know of its existence.  To that end, this paper
provides an index to the vast realm of network information. Most of
the documents listed here are POINTERS to the final information.
<p>

Second, even if you know of a document's existence, you may not know
if it is important or relevant.  Few of us are knowledgeable in more
than a limited area.  We need to rely on others to make us aware of
the importance of databases in a specific discipline. Librarians can
be of great assistance here.  They are familiar with the research
databases that individuals search in law, mathematics, and many other
fields.
<p>

Finally, once existence and importance are known, the information
needs to be indexed so that researchers can find it.  This is the
most difficult task to accomplish.  Information available on the
network is rarely static.  It is always moving, growing, changing,
and dying.  Computers should be able to assist us in managing this
ever-changing environment.  Right now, we have to catalog the
information as it passes through the network.  In my  case, I
generally save it in a file somewhere and spend far too much time
trying to retrieve it again when I need it.
<p>

<h5>1.5  Access to the Internet</h5>
<p>

A frequently asked question concerns how the average mortal gets
access to the Internet.  The most common way is via electronic mail.
Using e-mail, it is possible to communicate with anyone on the
Internet and on any other networks as well, and there are many
"gateways" to the Internet from other networks and systems.  For
instance using CompuServe, a large commercial electronic information
and communication service, you can send e-mail to and from
individuals on the Internet.
<p>

A direct connection to the Internet provides some additional
capabilities that e-mail cannot.  One of these is the ability to
establish a connection to a remote computer connected to the Internet
from your own personal computer or from one connected to the
Internet. The program that establishes this connection is called
Telnet.  Many universities and large research companies have Internet
connections.  They pay rather large fees to have these high speed
(more than one million bits per second) connections.  If you are
associated with a large university or company you already may have
access or can gain access to the Internet using one of their
computers.
<p>

A direct connection to the Internet also allows you to transfer a
file from a remote computer.  This program is referred to as FTP
(file transfer protocol).  Section 4.0 covers the many places that
have files and programs available using FTP.
<p>

The following information was taken from a Frequently Asked Question
posting by Aydin Edguer to the alt.bbs newsgroup.
<p>

If you do not have access to a service connected to Internet, you can
get access for a fee.  The following companies provide Internet
access to individuals or companies at various rates depending on the
time of access, speed of access desired, and several other factors.
<p>

The first method to gain access to the Internet is by getting an
account on a public access bulletin board system that is connected to
the Internet.  There are a growing number of such systems available.
For information on some of these systems, send electronic mail to:
<p>
<br>info@world.std.com
<br>info@netcom.com
<br>info@concert.net
<br>info@panix.com
<br>info@holonet.net
<br>info@msen.com
<br>info@csn.org
<br>sysadmin@ids.com
<p>

Any of these systems is open to the public for a monthly access fee.
<p>

A second method to gain access to the Internet is by getting an
account with a network service provider who offers a dial-in service.
See the "How do I get connected to the Internet?" section for more
information.
<p>

<b>How do I get connected to the Internet?</b>
<p>

Traditionally, connections to the Internet were dedicated
connections.  This is still the most common type of connection.
Monthly costs for the connection range anywhere from $250 per month
[plus line charges] for a dialup 9600-bps connection to $4,000 [plus
line charges] for a T1 [1.44-Mbps] connection.  There is also an
initial one-time startup fee of anywhere from $100 to $8,000 [plus
equipment charges].
<p>

Some service providers also are offering part-time dialup
connections.  Customers share a set of phone lines and dialup when
needed.  This is usually less expensive than dedicated dialup
connections for customers who need a connection less than 80 hours
per month.  Monthly costs range from $40-100 per month [plus line
charges] plus an hourly charge of $2-4.
<p>

Some service providers have begun to offer a new dial-in service.
The name for dial-in service varies from vendor to vendor.  The
dial-in service is usually provided as a way for Internet-connected
users to connect back to their home sites from remote locations.  But
most service providers do not limit their service to this audience,
it is open to people not already on the Internet.  The dial-in
service provides either a terminal server connection [with password]
or an account on the service provider's equipment [with password]
which permits you to use Telnet to connect to other sites on the
Internet.  This service differs from the normal dialup IP services
because it does not require the user to run any IP software like PPP
(Point-to-Point protocol) or SLIP (serial line IP).  The cost for
this service usually range from $35 to $250 per month [plus line
charges].  There is also an initial $35 to $500 connection fee [plus
equipment charges].
<p>

The following is a list of known Internet service providers, along
with the services they offer, an e-mail address to contact for more
information, a phone number to contact for more information, or an
FTP archive for more information.

<p>

Please note, although this is a Frequently asked Question, this
newsgroup, alt.bbs.internet, is NOT for the discussion of how to get
connected to the Internet.  This is the correct newsgroup to discuss
your bulletin board system and what it offers once you are connected
to the Internet.
<p>

The above excerpt is from a frequently asked questions Usenet posting
to alt.bbs.internet and crossposted to news.answers.  The
news.answers newsgroup is a very good group to subscribe to read the
frequently asked questions sent to many newsgroups.  See 12.6 Usenet
entry in the Glossary for more information on newsgroups.
<p>

Further investigation in the above groups yields a great deal of
information about techniques and rates to access the Internet.  Of
course one common question is about getting free access.  As
mentioned before if you are associated with a university, a large
company, or research group you may very well have access via one of
their computers.  If you are a student or faculty member and are away
from your local campus, you may be able to get a guest account from
the local university.
<p>

Some campuswide information systems may give limited access to the
network in a read-only mode.  Also some communities (such as
Cleveland) operate a FREENET which enables you to read newsgroups and
if you register send mail at no charge.  See section 8.0 for more
information.
<p>

For example, you can Telnet to Holonet below to get an idea of how it
works.  This is not an endorsement of this system but it does give
you a good idea how this type of access to an Internet BBS works.

<h5>2.16 World Wide Webb</h5>
<p>

The WWW project merges the techniques of information retrieval and
hypertext to make an easy but powerful global information system.
<p>

The project is based on the philosophy that academic information
should be freely available to anyone. Its aim is to permit
information sharing within internationally dispersed teams and
dissemination of information by support groups.  Originally aimed
at the High Energy Physics community, it has spread to other areas
and attracted much interest in user support, resource discovery,
and collaborative work areas.
<p>

<h5>Reader View</h5>
<p>

The WWW world consists of documents and links.  Indexes are
special documents which, rather than being read, can be searched.
The result of such a search is another ("virtual") document
containing links to the documents found.  A simple protocol
("HTTP") is used to allow a browser program to request a keyword
search by a remote information server.
<p>

The web contains documents in many formats. Those hypertext
documents (real or virtual) contain links to other documents or
places within documents.  All documents, whether real, virtual or
indexes, look similar to the reader and are contained within the
same addressing scheme.
<p>

To follow a link, you either click with a mouse or type in a
number. To search an index, give keywords or other search
criteria. These are the only operations necessary to access the
entire world of data.
<p>

You can try the simple line mode browser by Telnetting to
info.cern.ch (no user or password) From UK JANET, use the gateway.
You also can find out more about WWW in this way.  This is the
least sophisticated browser; remember that the window-oriented
ones are much smarter.
<p>

It is much more efficient to install a browser on your own
machine. The line mode browser is currently available in source
form by anonymous FTP from node: info.cern.ch [currently
128.141.201.74] as:
<p>

/pub/www/src/WWWLineMode_v.vv.tar.Z.
<p>

(v.vv is the version number - take the latest.)
<p>

Also available is a hypertext editor for the NeXT
(WWWNeXTStepEditor_v.vv.tar.Z), the ViolaWWW browser for X11, and
a skeleton server daemon (WWWDaemon_v.vv.tar.Z).
<p>

Documentation is readable using www. A plain text version of the
installation instructions is included in the tar file.  Printable
(PostScript) documentation and articles are in /pub/www/doc

<h3>4.0  The Mother Lode of Anonymous FTP Sites</h3></a>
<p>

Throughout this document, sites are listed for specific documents.
Most are only indexes to more information.  A big problem is
searching through all this information to find what you want.  One of
the best search methods is Archie, described below.
<p>

Several sites contain large repositories of files and other sites
that are the source for specific programs such as Kermit, the public
domain file transfer program.
<p>

<h5>4.05 archie</h5>
<p>

One of the best ways of searching for a program available via
anonymous FTP is with archie (Archive Server Listing Service),
several of these servers scattered throughout the world.  The
fastest one I have found is the Advanced Network  &amp  Services, Inc.
located in the United States.
<p>

Archie goes to every site that offers anonymous FTP files,
collects the file structure from that site, and places it in a
database it can search.
<p>

A real-life example.  I was reading an article about Windows in
the July 1992 issue of PC World, and it mentioned a shareware
program called ZiPaper on page 212.  The name of the program is
zipapr.zip.  I can use Archie to locate this program.
<p>

Source:<pre>
<p>

telnet archie.ans.net
<p>
login as archie
<p>
At the archie prompt type
<p>
prog zipapr.zip
<p>
The response is
<p>
Host wuarchive.wustl.edu  (128.252.135.2)
Last updated 17:22 13 July 1992
<p>
Location:  /mirrors3/archive.umich.edu/msdos/mswindows/desktop
FILE      rw-rw-r--   41984  Jan 30 1991  zipapr.zip
</pre>
<p>

This tells you the file is available via anonymous FTP to
wuarchive.wustl.edu in the directory
mirrors3/archive.umich.edu/msdos/mswindows/desktop and the file is
zipapr.zip.
<p>

<h5>4.1  Washington University (anonymous FTP)</h5>
<p>

Washington University represents perhaps one of the most popular
sites for software on the network.  The Mirrors directory contains
a copy of all of the wsmr-simtel20.army.mil files. Wsmr-simtel20-
army.mil is the originator and keeper of major amounts of public
domain software.  Their site, however, is often overloaded and
difficult to connect to.
<p>

You will find enough software in the Mirrors directory to keep you
busy for the rest of your life.  The MS-DOS and Macintosh
subdirectories contain files for those specific machines.
<p>
<pre>
Anonymous FTP to wuarchive.wustl.edu
cd mirrors
<p>
cd msdos
<p>
For income tax time cd taxes
For unzipping files cd zip, type binary, and get pkz110eu.exe
For education software cd education
For graphics files cd giff, tiff or graphics
<p>
cd macintosh
<p>
</pre>
For the Macintosh there are directories for applications, inits,
sounds, reviews, and many more.
<p>

<h5>4.2  KERMIT (anonymous FTP)</h5>
<p>

Kermit is a public domain file transfer protocol available for
just about all microcomputers, minicomputers, andmainframes.  It
is very popular and has been has been used at computer facilities
everywhere.
<p>

Anonymous FTP to watsun.cc.columbia.edu
<p>
<pre>
cd kermit
get read.me
</pre>
<p>

For executable versions of kermit:
<p>
<pre>
cd bin
<p>
get READ.ME file and read for specifics of what file to get.
<p>
</pre>
<p>
For the IBM PC, I get msvibm.exe after typing binary to activate
the binary transfer mode.
<p>

<h5>4.3  NCSA Software for Network Access from PCs (anonymous FTP)</h5>
<p>

<h3>7.0  Campuswide Information Systems - CWISes</h3></a>
<p>

The information in this section is intended primarily for those  who
are providing access methods from their own computing environments.
Although standards have been proposed, there are no "packages" that
give you access to all of the information presented here.  What The
Ohio State University and several other universities have done is
provide a menu to the user that accesses these services and databases
behind the scenes.  In fact, I  had to refer to the shell scripts to
look up the network addresses of these machines, because I rely on
the menu for access as well.
<p>

As the name implies, information systems provide access to
information the user knowing exactly how to get to it.  In this way,
the network is invisible to end users.  All they need to know is what
they want, not the command structure needed to actually get the
information.
<p>

At present, the menu system seems to be the easiest way in In the
background is a knowbot, a program that knows how to go out and
locate services on the network using a keyword search.
<p>

You can connect to the following sites for a demonstration of their
capabilities.
<p>

Many CWIS systems are converting to Gopher (see section 8.96).
Hytelnet (see section 2.15) also has complete listings of CWIS
systems.

<h3>9.0  WHOIS - E-mail white pages</h3></a>
<p>

WHOIS is a program available on many workstation/mini/mainframe
computers that can connect to another computer. By supplying a
persons name, it will respond with information it has on the person.
A similar program called finger does the same type of thing, except
it only supplies information on individuals with an account on that
specific computer.  A WHOIS database generally is contains
information on most of the individuals at a university, not just on
the machine you connect to.
<p>

In a larger sense WHOIS is a technique for finding a person's e-mail
address.  There is no master list of e-mail addresses on the network.
Standards have been established for supplying e-mail addresses, but
it will take some time for it to be globally implemented.  In the
meantime, the easiest way to find out is to call and ask!
<p>

I can just hear the gasps of horror, using the phone for anything but
talking to your mom, sacrilege.  There are, of course, many ways of
finding a person's e-mail address.  But what you don't know is if the
person even reads his/her e-mail, and in the case of multiple e-mail
addresses, which one is correct.  A simple phone call the first time
will answer those unknowns quickly.
<p>

The following documents and resources will assist in finding a
person's e-mail address.
<p>

<h5>9.03 College E-mail Address</h5>
<p>

Mark Kantrowitz (mkant@cs.cmu.edu) of Caregie-Mellon University
has compiled an extensive list of techniques for locating e-mail
addresses for many universities.  This document contains an
alphabetic listing of universities and searching techniques unique
to each.
<p>

Anonymous ftp to a.gp.cs.cmu.edu
Note: for password you must use your e-mail address in the
form of name@computer.
cd /afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mkant/Public/Email
<p>

Note: you must cd to this directory as above, because
intermediate directories are protected.
get college-email.-#.text.##
Note: the files are separated into several sections and you
need to specify the sections you want by replacing the #
shown above with a number 1, 2, 3 etc.
<p>

You also can send mail to mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu with
no subject and the body of the text message (with no signature)
<p>

<h5>9.07 Inter-Network Guide</h5>
<p>

When mailing from one network to another you need to know what
address to use to access the gateway.  For instance, if you want
to send a message from the Internet to someone on CompuServe, you
address it to 12345.1234@compuserve.com, where the 12345.1234 is
the person's CompuServe ID in the form 12345,1234.
<p>

The Inter-Network Mail Guide by John Chew provides this
information.

<h3>12.0  Glossary</h3></a>
<p>

I use some terms here that may not be familiar to all.  The
following is a brief explanation.
<p>

<h5>12.1  BITNET:</h5>
<p>

A network of mainframes or minicomputers.  BITNET
connects many universities and colleges.  It provides
e-mail and file transfer capabilities, but does not have the
ability to do remote login (Telnet session capability).
<p>

<h5>12.2  Internet:</h5>
<p>

A very large network that connects just about any types of
computers.  It supports e-mail, file transfer (FTP), and
remote login (Telnet).
<p>

<h5>12.3  Anonymous FTP:</h5>
<p>

The ability to transfer a file from a remote computer connected
to the Internet without having an account on the remote computer.
The program that performs the file transfer is normal FTP.  To
connect to a remote computer offering anonymous FTP, you can use
the following commands from a computer connected to the Internet.
<p>

FTP Internet computer name
When prompted for a userid, type anonymous
When prompted for a password, type your e-mail address
To get a listing of files type dir
To change directory, type cd directory name
To get a file, type get filename
To get a binary file, type binary then get filename
To end session, type quit
<p>

Example:
FTP pilot.njin.net
Username:  anonymous
Password:  yourname@computer.edu
cd pub/ftp-list
get ftp.list
quit
<p>

<h5>12.4  Telnet:</h5>
<p>

The ability to establish a connection to a remote computer
connected to the Internet network.  Two types of programs are used
to do this.  One, usually called Telnet, establishes a VT100-type
terminal emulation to the remote computer.  The second, TN3270,
establishes a full-screen IBM 3270-type terminal connection.
<p>

<h5>12.5  Listserv:</h5>
<p>

A program available on many BITNET connected computers that can
act as a mail forwarding system and as a file repository.  BITNET
is another network that links many colleges and universities It
does not normally link to military or government institutions as
does the Internet.  To subscribe to a listserv, you usually send
mail to the machine that has the mailing list with the command to
subscribe.  As an example, to subscribe to a list for discussion
of topics pertinent to mechanical engineering, send e-mail to
listserv@utarlvml with a message containing the one-line command
to subscribe:
<p>

SUB MECH-1 John Doe  (Where John Doe would be your full name)
<p>

<h5>12.6 Usenet/Read News</h5>
<p>

Newsgroups are like public bulletin boards that you can post and
read messages from other individuals world wide.  More than 1500
groups cover topics ranging from arts and recreation to more
research oriented topics such as physics, philosohy, microbiology
and many many others.  Normally you gain access through a computer
that has lots of disk space and is connected directly to the
Internet.  You can read many of the newgroups from the Cleveland
Freenet (section 8.1) or from commercial providors of Intenet
access; for example, Holonet (section 1.7).
<p>

Disclaimer
<p>

The information provided in the previous sections has been put
together from multiple sources acquired from the network.  Much of it
came from reading newsgroups and trying things out to see how they
worked.  The information is as accurate as I have been able to
determine, as of July 17, 1992.
<p>

I used a DEC5500 system running Ultrix to check most of these
sources.  Most of the information is oriented toward Internet, since
it has remote login (Telnet) and file transfer (FTP).
