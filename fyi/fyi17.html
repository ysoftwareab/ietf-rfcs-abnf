<h3>Abstract</h3></a>
<p>

Over the last two years, the attendance at Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF) Plenary meetings has grown phenomenally.  Approximately
38% of the attendees are new to the IETF at each meeting.  About 33%
of those go on to become regular attendees.  When the meetings were
smaller, it wasn't very difficult for a newcomer to get to know
people and get into the swing of things.  Today, however, a newcomer
meets many more new people, some previously known only as the authors
of Request For Comments (RFC) documents or thought provoking email
messages.
<p>

The purpose of this For Your Information (FYI) RFC is to explain to
the newcomers how the IETF works.  This will give them a warm, fuzzy
feeling and enable them to make the meeting more productive for
everyone.  This FYI will also provide the mundane bits of information
which everyone who attends an IETF meeting should know.

<a name="whatis">
<h4>What is the IETF?</h4></a>
<p>

The Internet Engineering Task Force is a loosely self-organized group
of people who make technical and other contributions to the
engineering and evolution of the Internet and its technologies.  It
is the principal body engaged in the development of new Internet
Standard specifications.  Its mission includes:
<p>
<ul>
<li>  Identifying, and proposing solutions to, pressing operational and
technical problems in the Internet;
<p>

<li>  Specifying the development or usage of protocols and the near-term
architecture to solve such technical problems for the Internet;
<p>

<li>  Making recommendations to the Internet Engineering Steering Group
(IESG) regarding the standardization of protocols and protocol
usage in the Internet;
<p>

<li>  Facilitating technology transfer from the Internet Research Task
Force (IRTF) to the wider Internet community; and
<p>

<li>  Providing a forum for the exchange of information within the
Internet community between vendors, users, researchers, agency
contractors, and network managers.
</ul>
<p>

The IETF Plenary meeting is not a conference, although there are
technical presentations.  The IETF is not a traditional standards
organization, although many standards are produced.  The IETF is the
volunteers who meet three times a year to fulfill the IETF mission.
<p>

There is no membership in the IETF.  Anyone may register for and
attend any meeting.  The closest thing there is to being an IETF
member is being on the IETF or Working Group mailing lists (see the
IETF Mailing Lists section).  This is where the best information
about current IETF activities and focus can be found.
<p>

<a name="humble">
<h4>Humble Beginnings</h4></a>
<p>

The first IETF meeting was held in January, 1986 at Linkabit in San
Diego with 15 attendees.  The 4th IETF, held at SRI in Menlo Park in
October, 1986, was the first at which non-government vendors
attended.  The concept of Working Groups (WG) was introduced at the
5th IETF meeting at the NASA Ames Research Center in California in
February, 1987.  The 7th IETF, held at MITRE in McLean, Virginia in
July, 1987, was the first meeting with over 100 attendees.
<p>

The 14th IETF meeting was held at Stanford University in July, 1989.
It marked a major change in the structure of the IETF universe.  The
IAB (then Internet Activities Board, now Internet Architecture
Board), which until that time oversaw many Task Forces, changed its
structure to leave only two: the IETF and the IRTF.  The IRTF is
tasked to consider the long-term research problems in the Internet.
The IETF also changed at that time.
<p>

After the Internet Society (ISOC) was formed in January 1992, the IAB
proposed to ISOC that the IAB's activities should take place under
the auspices of the Internet Society.  During INET92, in Kobe, Japan,
the ISOC Trustees approved a new charter for the IAB to reflect the
proposed relationship.
<p>

A recent first for the IETF was its first European meeting.  In July,
1993, the IETF met in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.  The U.S./non-U.S.
attendees split was nearly 50/50.
<p>

<a name="hierarchy">
<h4>The Hierarchy</h4></a>
<p>

To completely understand the structure of the IETF, it is useful to
understand the overall structure in which the IETF resides.  There
are four groups in the structure: the ISOC and its Board of Trustees
(BOT), the IAB, the IESG, and the IETF itself.
<p>

Internet standardization is an organized activity of the ISOC.  The
ISOC is a professional society that is concerned with the growth and
evolution of the worldwide Internet, with the way in which the
Internet is and can be used, and with the social, political, and
technical issues which arise as a result.  The BOT is responsible for
approving appointments to the IAB from among the nominees submitted
by the IETF nominating committee.
<p>

The IAB is a technical advisory group of the ISOC.  It is chartered
to provide oversight of the architecture of the Internet and its
protocols, and to serve, in the context of the Internet Standards
process, as a body to which the decisions of the IESG may be
appealed.  The IAB is responsible for approving appointments to the
IESG from among the nominees submitted by the IETF nominations
committee.
<p>

The IESG is responsible for technical management of IETF activities
and the Internet Standards process.  As part of the ISOC, it
administers the process according to the rules and procedures which
have been ratified by the ISOC BOT.  The IESG is directly responsible
for the actions associated with entry into and movement along the
IETF "standards track", including final approval of specifications as
Internet Standards.
<p>

The IETF is divided into nine functional Areas.  They are:
Applications, Internet Services, Network Management, Operational
Requirements, Routing, Security, Service Applications, Transport, and
User Services.  Each Area has at least one Area Director.  There is
also an Area Director who oversees Standards Management.  The Area
Directors, along with the IETF Chair, form the IESG.  Phillip Gross
has been the IETF Chair since the IETF's 7th meeting.  He founded the
IESG and serves as its Chair as well.
<p>

Each Area has several Working Groups.  A Working Group is a group of
people who work under a charter to achieve a certain goal.  That goal
may be the creation of an informational document, the creation of a
protocol standard, or the resolution of problems in the Internet.
Most Working Groups have a finite lifetime.  That is, once a Working
Group has achieved its goal, it disbands.  As in the IETF, there is
no official membership for a Working Group.  Unofficially, a Working
Group member is somebody who's on that Working Group's mailing list;
however, anyone may attend a Working Group meeting (see the Be
Prepared section below).
<p>

Areas may also have Birds of a Feather (BOF) groups.  They generally
have the same goals as Working Groups, except that they have no
charter and usually only meet once or twice.  BOFs are often held to
determine if there is enough interest to form a Working Group.
<p>

<a name="maillist">
<h4>IETF Mailing Lists</h4></a>
<p>

Anyone who plans to attend an IETF meeting should join the IETF
announcements mailing list.  This is where all of the meeting
information, new and revised Internet-Draft and RFC announcements,
IESG Recommendations, and Last Calls are posted.  People who'd like
to "get technical" may also join the IETF discussion list,
"ietf@cnri.reston.va.us".  This was the only list before the
announcement list was created and is where discussions of cosmic
significance are held (most Working Groups have their own mailing
lists for discussions relating to their work).  To join the IETF
announcement list, send a request to:
<p><pre>

ietf-announce-request@cnri.reston.va.us
</pre><p>

To join the IETF discussion list, send a request to:
<p><pre>

ietf-request@cnri.reston.va.us
</pre><p>

To join both of the lists, simply send a single message, to either
"-request" address, and indicate that you'd like to join both lists.
<p>

Do not, ever, under any circumstances, for any reason, send a request
to join a list to the list itself!  The thousands of people on the
list don't need, or want, to know when a new person joins.
Similarly, when changing email addresses or leaving a list, send your
request only to the "-request" address, not to the main list.  This
means you!!
<p>

The IETF discussion list is unmoderated.  This means that anyone can
express their opinions about issues affecting the Internet.  However,
it is not a place for companies or individuals to solicit or
advertise.  Only the Secretariat can send a message to the
announcement list.
<p>

Even though the IETF mailing lists "represent" the IETF membership at
large, it is important to note that attending an IETF meeting does
not automatically include addition to either mailing list.
<p>

<a name="reg">
<h4>Registration</h4></a>
<p>

As previously mentioned, all meeting announcements are sent to the
IETF announcement list.  Within the IETF meeting announcement is a
Registration Form and complete instructions for registering,
including, of course, the cost.  The Secretariat highly recommends
that attendees preregister.  Early registration, which ends about one
month before the meeting, carries a lower registration fee.  As the
size of the meetings has grown, so has the length of the lines at the
registration desk.  Fortunately, there are three lines:
"preregistered and prepaid" (which moves very quickly),
"preregistered and on-site payment" (which moves a little more
slowly), and "registration and on-site payment" (take a guess).
<p>

Registration is open all week.  However, the Secretariat highly
recommends that attendees arrive for early registration, beginning at
6:00 P.M. (meeting local time), on the Sunday before the opening
plenary.  Not only will there be fewer people, but there will also be
a reception at which people can get a byte to eat.  If the
registration lines are long, one can eat first and try again when the
lines are shorter.
<p>

Registered attendees (and there isn't any other kind) receive a
Registration Packet.  It contains a general orientation sheet, the
At-A-Glance sheet, a list of Working Group acronyms, the most recent
Agenda, and a name tag.  The At-A-Glance is a very important
reference and is used throughout the week.  It contains Working
Group/BOF room assignments and a map of room locations.  Attendees
who prepaid will also find their receipt in their packet.
<p>
<a name="newbies">
<h4>Newcomers' Orientation</h4></a>
<p>

Newcomers are encouraged to attend the IETF Newcomers' Orientation.
As the name implies, it is an orientation for first time attendees to
IETF meetings.  The orientation is organized and conducted by the
IETF Secretariat and is intended to provide useful introductory
information.  The Secretariat tries to keep the orientation session
informal, and is usually successful at it.
<p>

The orientation is typically 30-45 minutes long and covers a number
of topics: what's in the attendee packets, what all the dots on name
tags mean, and how to read the At-A-Glance.  There is also discussion
about the organization of the IETF: Working Groups and their Areas,
and the IESG.  There is ample time at the end for questions.  The
Secretariat also provides handouts which include the text from the
IETF Overview and a list of important files maintained on the IETF
Shadow directories.
<p>

The orientation is held on Sunday afternoon and ends about 30 mintues
before the Registration Reception.  However, attending the
orientation does NOT mean you can go to the reception early!
<p>

<a name="dress">
<h4>Dress Code</h4></a>
<p>

Since attendees must wear their name tags, they must also wear shirts
or blouses.  Pants or skirts are also highly recommended.  Seriously
though, many newcomers are often embarrassed when they show up Monday
morning in suits, to discover that everybody else is wearing T-
shirts, jeans (shorts, if weather permits) and sandals.  There are
those in the IETF who refuse to wear anything other than suits.
Fortunately, they are well known (for other reasons) so they are
forgiven this particular idiosyncrasy.  The general rule is "dress
for the weather" (unless you plan to work so hard that you won't go
outside, in which case, "dress for comfort" is the rule!).
<p>

<a name="spots">
<h4>Seeing Spots Before Your Eyes</h4></a>
<p>

Some of the people at the IETF will have a little colored dot on
their name tag.  A few people have more than one.  These dots
identify people who are silly enough to volunteer to do a lot of
extra work.  The colors have the following meanings:
<p>

<br>red    - IAB member
<br>yellow - IESG member
<br>blue   - Working Group/BOF chair
<br>green  - Local host
<p>

Local hosts are the people who can answer questions about the
terminal room, restaurants, and points of interest in the area.
<p>

Some people have Gold Stars on their name tags.  The stars indicate
that those people chaired Working Groups or BOFs in the IETF Area
which submitted all of its Working Group/BOF Minutes and Area Report
from the previous meeting first.  The stars are the Secretariat's way
of saying "Thank You" for providing the necessary information
quickly.
<p>

It is important that newcomers to the IETF not be afraid to strike up
conversations with people who wear these dots.  If the IAB and IESG
members, and Working Group and BOF chairs, didn't want to talk to
anybody, they wouldn't be wearing the dots in the first place.
<p>

To make life simpler for the Secretariat, Registration Packets are
also coded with little colored dots.  These are only for Secretariat
use, so nobody else needs to worry about them.  Please, don't peel
them off your packet and put them on your name tag.
<p>

<a name="term">
<h4>Terminal Room</h4></a>
<p>

One of the most important (depending on your point of view) things
the local host does is provide Internet access to the meeting
attendees.  In general, the connectivity is excellent.  This is
entirely due to the Olympian efforts of the local hosts, and their
ability to beg, borrow and steal.  The people and companies who
donate their equipment, services, and time are to be heartily
congratulated and thanked.
<p>

While preparation far in advance of the meeting is encouraged, there
may be some unavoidable "last minute" things which can be
accomplished in the terminal room.  It may also be useful to people
who need to make trip reports or status reports while things are
still fresh in their minds.
<p>


<a name="social">
<h3>Social Event</h3></a>
<p>

Another of the most important things organized and managed by the
local hosts is the IETF social event.  The social event has become
something of a tradition at the IETF meetings.  It has been
immortalized by Marshal Rose with his reference to "many fine lunches
and dinners" [ROSE], and by Claudio and Julia Topolcic with their
rendition of "Nerds in Paradise" on a pink T-shirt.
<p>

Newcomers to the IETF are encouraged to attend the social event.
<p>

Everyone is encouraged to wear their name tags.  The social event is
designed to give people a chance to meet on a social, rather than
technical, level.
<p>

Sometimes, the social event is a computer or high-tech related event.
At the Boston IETF, for example, the social was dinner at the
Computer Museum.  Other times, the social might be a dinner cruise or
a trip to an art gallery.
<p>


<a name="agenda">
<h3>Agenda</h3></a>
<p>

The Agenda for the IETF meetings is a very fluid thing.  It is sent,
in various forms, to the IETF announcement list three times prior to
the meeting.  The final Agenda is included in the Registration
Packets.  Of course, "final" in the IETF doesn't mean the same thing
as it does elsewhere in the world.  The final Agenda is simply the
version that went to the printers.
<p>

The Secretariat will announce Agenda changes during the morning
plenary sessions.  Changes will also be posted on the bulletin board
near the IETF Registration Table (not the hotel registration desk).
<p>

Assignments for breakout rooms (that's where the Working Groups and
BOFs meet) and a map showing the room locations make up the At-A-
Glance sheet (included in the Registration Packets).  Room
assignments are as flexible as the Agenda.  Some Working Groups meet
multiple times during a meeting and every attempt is made to have a
Working Group meet in the same room each session.  Room assignment
changes are not necessarily permanent for the week.  Always check the
At-A-Glance first, then the bulletin board.  When in doubt, check
with a member of the Secretariat at the Registration Table.
<p>


<a name="general">
<h3>Other General Things</h3></a>
<p>

The opening Plenary on Monday morning is the most heavily attended
session.  It is where important introductory remarks are made, so
people are encouraged to attend.
<p>

The IETF Secretariat, and IETFers in general, are very approachable.
Never be afraid to approach someone and introduce yourself.  Also,
don't be afraid to ask questions, especially when it comes to jargon
and acronyms!
<p>

Hallway conversations are very important.  A lot of very good work
gets done by people who talk together between meetings and over
lunches and dinners.  Every minute of the IETF can be considered work
time (much to some people's dismay).
<p>

A "Bar BOF" is an unofficial get-together, usually in the late
evening, during which a lot of work gets done over drinks.
<p>

It's unwise to get between a hungry IETFer (and there isn't any other
kind) and coffee break brownies and cookies, no matter how
interesting a hallway conversation is.
<p>

IETFers are fiercely independent.  It's safe to question opinions and
offer alternatives, but don't expect an IETFer to follow orders.
<p>

The IETF, and the plenary sessions in particular, are not places for
vendors to try to sell their wares.  People can certainly answer
questions about their company and its products, but bear in mind that
the IETF is not a trade show.  This does not preclude people from
recouping costs for IETF related T-shirts, buttons and pocket
protectors.
<p>


<a name="bullets">
<h3>Registration Bullets</h3></a>
<p>

Registration is such an important topic, that it's in this RFC twice!
This is the "very important registration bullets" section.
<p>
<ul>
<li>  To attend an IETF meeting: you have to register and you have to
pay the registration fee.
<p>

<li>  All you need to do to be registered is to send in a completed
Registration Form.
<p>

<li>  You may register by mail, email or fax.  Generally, email and fax
registration forms will be accepted until 1:00 P.M. ET on the
Friday before the meeting.
<p>

<li> You may preregister and pay, preregister and pay later,
preregister and pay on-site, or register and pay on-site.
<p>

<li> To get the lower registration fee, you must register by the early
registration deadline (about one month before the meeting).  You
can still pay later or on-site.
<p>

<li>If you don't register by the early registration deadline, a late
fee is added.
<p>

<li> Everyone pays the same fees.  There are no educational or group
discounts.  There are no discounts for attending only part of the
week.
<p>

<li> Register only ONE person per registration form.  Substitutions are
NOT allowed.
<p>

<li> You may register then pay later, but you may not pay then register
later.  Payment MUST be accompanied by a completed registration
form.
<p>

<li> Purchase orders are NOT accepted.  DD Form 1556 is accepted.
Invoice for payment cannot be accepted.
<p>

<li> Refunds are subject to a $20 service charge.  Late fees will not
be refunded.
<p>

<li> The registration fee covers a copy of the meeting's Proceedings,
Sunday evening reception (cash bar), a daily continental
breakfast, and daily coffee breaks.
</ul><p>


<a name="archives">
<h3>Mailing Lists and Archives</h3></a>
<p>

As previously mentioned, the IETF announcement and discussion mailing
lists are the central mailing lists for IETF activities.  However,
there are many other mailing lists related to IETF work.  For
example, every Working Group has its own discussion list.  In
addition, there are some long-term technical debates which have been
moved off of the IETF list onto lists created specifically for those
topics.  It is highly recommended that everybody follow the
discussions on the mailing lists of the Working Groups which they
wish to attend.  The more work that is done on the mailing lists, the
less work that will need to be done at the meeting, leaving time for
cross pollination (i.e., attending Working Groups outside one's
primary area of interest in order to broaden one's perspective).
<p>

The mailing lists also provide a forum for those who wish to follow,
or contribute to, the Working Groups' efforts, but cannot attend the
IETF meetings.
<p>

All IETF discussion lists have a "-request" address which handles the
administrative details of joining and leaving the list.  It is
generally frowned upon when such administrivia appears on the
discussion mailing list.
<p>

Most IETF discussion lists are archived.  That is, all of the
messages sent to the list are automatically stored on a host for
anonymous FTP access.  To find out where a particular list is
archived, send a message to the list's "-request" address, NOT to the
list itself.
<p>


<a name="address">
<h3>Important Email Addresses</h3></a>
<p>

There are some important IETF email addresses with which everyone
should be familiar.  They are all located at "cnri.reston.va.us"
(e.g., "ietf-info@cnri.reston.va.us").  To personalize things, the
names of the Secretariat staff who respond to the messages are given
for each address.

<p>

<a name="proc">
<h3>IETF Proceedings</h3></a>
<p>

The IETF Proceedings are compiled in the two months following each
IETF meeting.  The Proceedings usually start with a message from
Steve Coya, the Executive Director of the IETF.  Each contains the
final (hindsight) Agenda, an IETF overview, a report from the IESG,
Area and Working Group reports, network status briefings, slides from
the protocol and technical presentations, and the attendees list.
The attendees list includes an attendee's name, affiliation, work
phone number, work fax number, and email address, as provided on the
Registration Form.
<p>

A copy of the Proceedings will be sent to everyone who registered for
the IETF.  The cost is included in the registration fee.  The
Proceedings are sent to the mailing addresses provided on the
Registration Forms.
<p>

For those who could not attend a meeting but would like a copy of the
Proceedings send a check for $35 (made payable to CNRI) to:

<h3>InterNIC Archives</h3></a>
<p>

There is a tremendous amount of material available for those who
follow the work of the IETF.  To make it easier to know what to read
to prepare for a meeting, the InterNIC has established a document
archive.  Beginning about one month prior to an IETF meeting, Working
Group/BOF Chairs and Area Directors put documents relevent to the
discussions to be held into the archives.  Those people who plan to
attend a Working Group/BOF session should check the archives for
documents which need to be read.  The documents are left in the
archives for about two months after the end of the IETF meeting.
<p>


On the host "ds.internic.net", documents are stored in the directory
"/pub/current-ietf-docs" under subdirectories named for each Area and
then for each Working Group.  For example, a document for the NISI
Working Group, which is in the User Services Area, would be stored as
"current-ietf-docs/usv/nisi/nisi-doc1.txt".  Each Area will also have
a subdirectory called "bof", where documents to be discussed in BOF
sessions will be placed.  A directory called "plenary" will also be
created under "/pub/current-ietf-docs" to put documents or viewgraphs
related to a plenary session.  Any filename conflicts will be
resolved by the archive administrator working with the submitter of
the document via email.
<p>

It is important to note that the service is provided by the InterNIC
and that the documents are submitted by the people who work on them.
The IETF Secretariat does not manage or monitor the archive service.
<p>

Access via anonymous FTP:
<p>

<br>Anonymous FTP to ds.internic.net
<br>Change directory to /pub/current-ietf-docs
<br>Browse and get the document of interest
<p>

Access via GOPHER (from a Gopher client):
<p>

<br>Point to gopher.internic.net
<br>Select menu item 4, InterNIC Directory and Database Services ...
<br>Then menu item named "Internet Documentation (RFC's FYI's, etc.)/"
<br>Lastly menu item named "Current IETF Conference Documents (...)/"
<p>

If you do not have a Gopher client, use the InterNIC's public-access
Gopher client.  Simply telnet to "gopher.internic.net" and login as
"gopher" (no password required).
<p>


<a name="prepare">
<h3>Be Prepared</h3></a>
<p>

This topic cannot be stressed enough.  As the IETF grows, it becomes
more and more important for attendees to arrive prepared for the
Working Group meetings they plan to attend.  This doesn't apply only
to newcomers; everybody should come prepared.
<p>

Being prepared means having read the documents which the Working
Group or BOF Chair has distributed.  It means having followed the
discussions on the Working Group's mailing list or having reviewed
the archives.  For the Working Group/BOF Chairs, it means getting all
of the documents out early (i.e., several weeks) to give everybody
time to read them and announcing an agenda and sticking to it.
<p>

At the Chair's discretion, some time may be devoted to bringing new
Working Group attendees up to speed.  In fact, long lived Working
Groups have occasionally held entire sessions which were introductory
in nature.  As a rule, however, a Working Group is not the place to
go for training.  Observers are always welcome, but they must realize
that the work effort cannot be delayed for education.  Anyone wishing
to attend a Working Group for the first time might seek out the Chair
prior to the meeting and ask for some introduction.
<p>

Another thing, for everybody, to consider is that Working Groups go
through phases.  In the initial phase (say, the first two meetings),
all ideas are welcome.  The idea is to gather all the possible
solutions together for consideration.  In the development phase, a
solution is chosen and developed.  Trying to reopen issues which were
decided more than a couple of meetings back is considered bad form.
The final phase (the last two meetings) is where the "spit and
polish" are applied to the architected solution.  This is not the
time to suggest architectural changes or open design issues already
resolved.  It's a bad idea to wait until the last minute to speak out
if a problem is discovered.  This is especially true for people whose
excuse is that they hadn't read the documents until the day before a
comments period ended.
<p>

Time at the IETF meetings is a precious thing.  Working Groups are
encouraged to meet between IETF meetings, either in person or by
video or telephone conference.  Doing as much work as possible over
the mailing lists would also reduce the amount of work which must be
done at the meeting.
<p>

<a name="rfcs">
<h3>RFCs and Internet-Drafts</h3></a>
<p>

Originally, RFCs were just what the name implies; they were requests
for comments.  The early RFCs were messages between the ARPANET
architects about how to resolve certain problems.  Over the years,
RFCs became more formal.  It reached the point that they were being
cited as standards, even when they weren't.
<p>

To help clear up some confusion, there are now two special sub-series
within the RFCs: FYIs and STDs.  The For Your Information RFC sub-
series was created to document overviews and topics which are
introductory.  Frequently, FYIs are created by groups within the IETF
User Services Area.  The STD RFC sub-series was created to identify
those RFCs which do in fact specify Internet Standards.
<p>

Every RFC, including FYIs and STDs, have an RFC number by which they
are indexed and by which they can be retrieved.  FYIs and STDs have
FYI numbers and STD numbers, respectively, in addition to RFC
numbers.  This makes it easier for a new Internet user, for example,
to find all of the helpful, informational documents by looking for
the FYIs amongst all the RFCs.  If an FYI or STD is revised, its RFC
number will change, but its FYI or STD number will remain contant for
ease of reference.
<p>

There is also an RTR subseries of RFCs for Reseaux Associes pour la
Recherche Europeenne (RARE) Technical Reports.  These are technical
reports developed in the RARE community that are published as RFCs to
provide easy access to the general Internet community.
<p>

Internet-Drafts (I-D) are working documents of the IETF.  Any group
(e.g., Working Group, BOF) or individual may submit a document for
distribution as an I-D.  An I-D is valid for six months.  Guidelines
require that an expiration date appear on every page of an I-D.  An
I-D may be updated, replaced or obsoleted at any time.  It is not
appropriate to use I-Ds as reference material or to cite them, other
than as a "working draft" or "work in progress".
<p>

<ul>
<li>  Request for Comments on Request for Comments [RFC1111]
<li>  F.Y.I. on F.Y.I: Introduction to the F.Y.I notes [FYI1]

                              Working Groups' acronyms.
</pre><p>

Additionally, the full charters and minutes of the Working Groups and
BOFs are archived in the "ietf" directory.
<p>

All of these documents are available by anonymous FTP from the
following primary sites (there may be closer shadow sites, so check
with your network administrator):
<p>
<ul>
<li>  North America    Address:  <a href="ftp://ds.internic.net">ds.internic.net</a> (198.49.45.10)
<li>  Pacific Rim      Address:  <a href="ftp://munnari.oz.au">munnari.oz.au</a> (128.250.1.21)
<li>  Europe           Address:  <a href="ftp://nic.nordu.net">nic.nordu.net</a> (192.36.148.17)
</ul><p>

These files are also available through the Internet Gopher at
<a href="gopher://ietf.cnri.reston.va.us">"ietf.cnri.reston.va.us"</a>.
<p>

Residing on the same archive sites are the RFCs and Internet-Drafts.
They are in the "rfc" and "internet-drafts" directories,
respectively.  The file "rfc-index.txt" contains the latest
information about the RFCs (e.g., which have been obsoleted by
which).  In general, only the newest version of an Internet-Draft is
available.
<p>

All of the files, RFCs and Internet-Drafts are also available via
email from various mail servers.  To to get the IETF agenda,
Internet-Draft abstracts and RFC 1150 from the mail server at the
InterNIC, for example, you would send the following message:
<p>
<pre>
To: mailserv@ds.internic.net             Message header
Subject: anything you want

FILE /ietf/0mtg-agenda.txt               Body of the message
FILE /internet-drafts/1id-abstracts.txt
FILE /rfc/rfc1150.txt
PATH jdoe@anywhere.us
</pre><p>

Where: FILE specifies the name of a file to be returned and PATH
specifies the email address to which the file(s) should be sent.
<p>

RFCs may also be retrieved, using email, from ISI's RFC-Info server
at "rfc-info@isi.edu".  To get a specific RFC, include the following
in the body of the message:
<p><pre>

Retrieve: RFC
Doc-ID: RFC0951
</pre><p>

This example would cause a copy of RFC 951 (the leading zero in the
Doc-ID is required) to be emailed to the requestor.  To get a list of
available RFCs which match certain criteria, include the following in
the body of the message:
<p><pre>

LIST: RFC
Keywords: Gateway
</pre><p>

This example would email a list of all RFCs with "Gateway" in the
title, or as an assigned keyword, to the requestor.  To get
information on other ways to get RFCs:
<p><pre>
