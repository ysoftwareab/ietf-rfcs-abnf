<p>

This bibliography offers a short list of recent information resources
that will help the network novice become familiar with the Internet,
including its associated networks, resources, protocols, and history.
This FYI RFC includes references to free sources of information
available on-line as well as traditional publications.  A short
section at the end includes information for accessing the on-line
files.  This FYI is intentionally brief so it can be easily used as a
handout by user services personnel.
