<h1>F.Y.I. on F.Y.I.</h1>
<h2>Introduction to the F.Y.I. Notes</h2>
<p>
<hr>
<h3>Status of this Memo</h3>
<p>
This RFC is the first in a new sub-series of RFCs called FYIs (For
Your Information).  This memo provides information for the Internet
community.  It does not specify any standard.  Distribution of this
memo is unlimited.
<p>
<h4>1.  Introduction</h4>
<p>
The FYI series of notes is designed to provide Internet users with a
central repository of information about any topics which relate to
the Internet.  FYIs topics may range from historical memos on "Why it
was was done this way" to answers to commonly asked operational
questions.
<p>
The FYIs are intended for a wide audience.  Some FYIs will cater to
beginners, while others will discuss more advanced topics.  An FYI
may be submitted by anyone who has something to contribute and has
the time to do so.
<p>
<h4>2.  Why RFCs</h4>
<p>
There are several reasons why the FYIs are part of the larger RFC
series of notes.  The formost reason is that the distribution
mechanisms for RFCs are tried and true.  Anyone who can get an RFC,
can automatically get an FYI.  More importantly, anyone who knows of
the RFC series, can easily find out about the FYIs.
<p>
Another reason for making FYIs part of the RFC series is that the
maintainance mechanisms for RFCs are already in place and funded.  It
makes sense to maintain similar documents is a similar way.  After
all, there have been informational RFCs before.
<p>
Finally, the name RFC has come to carry a meaning with it.  There is
credibility associated with memos carrying the RFC label.  FYIs should
share that respect.
<p>

<h4>3.  Format Rules</h4>
<p>
Since the FYIs are a part of the RFC series, they must conform to
RFC-1111 (Request for Comments on Request for Comments: Instructions
to RFC Authors) with respect to format.  Ideally, they should be
submitted in ASCII format, as described by section 2a, of RFC-1111.
<p>

<h4>4.  Status Statement</h4>

<p>
Each RFC must include on its first page the "Status of this Memo"
section which contains a paragraph describing the intention of the
RFC.  This section is meant to convey the status granted by the RFC
Editor and the Internet Activities Board (IAB).  There are several
reasons for publishing a memo as an RFC, for example, to make
available some information for interested people, or to begin or
continue a discussion of an interesting idea, or to make available
the specification of a protocol.

<p>
For example:
<p>
This RFC is the first in a new sub-series of RFCs called FYIs (For
Your Information).  This memo provides information for the Internet
community.  It does not specify any standard.  Distribution of this
memo is unlimited.

<p>
<h4>5.  Distribution Statement</h4>

<p>
Each FYI is to also include a "distribution statement".  As the
purpose of the FYI series is to disseminate information, there is no
reason for the distribution to be anything other than "unlimited".

<p>
Typically, the distribution statement will simply be the sentence
"Distribution of this memo is unlimited." appended to the "Status of
this Memo" section.

<p>
<h4>6. Security Considerations</h4>

<p>
All FYIs must contain a section that discusses the security
considerations of the procedures that are the main topic of the RFC.

<p>
<h4>7.  Author's Address</h4>

<p>
Each FYI must have at the very end a section giving the author's
address, including the name and postal address, the telephone number,
and the Internet email address.

<p>

<h4>8.  Relation to other FYIs</h4>

<p>
Sometimes an FYI adds information on a topic discussed in a previous
FYI or completely replaces an earlier FYI.  There are two terms used
for these cases respectively, UPDATES and OBSOLETES.  A document that
obsoletes an earlier document can stand on its own.  A document that
merely updates an earlier document cannot stand on its own; it is
something that must be added to or inserted into the existing
document, and has limited usefulness independently.

<p>
UPDATES

<p>
To be used as a reference from a new item that cannot be used
alone (i.e., one that supplements a previous document), to refer
to the previous document.  The newer publication is a part that
will supplement or be added on to the existing document; e.g., an
addendum, or separate, extra information that is to be added to
the original document.

<p>
OBSOLETES

<p>
To be used to refer to an earlier document that is replaced by
this document.  This document contains either revised information,
or else all of the same information plus some new information,
however extensive or brief that new information is; i.e., this
document can be used alone, without reference to the older
document.

<p>
OBSOLETED-BY

<p>
To be used to refer to the newer document that replaces the older
document.

<p>
UPDATED-BY

<p>
To be used to refer to the newer document that adds information to
the existing, still useful, document.

<p>
<h4>9. The FYI Editors</h4>

<p>
All FYIs are submitted to the IETF User Services Working Group for
review prior to their submission to the RFC Editor.

<p>
Submissions may be made to:

<p>
Joyce K. Reynolds
<br>Chair, User Services Working Group
<br>USC - Information Sciences Institute
<br>4676 Admiralty Way
<br>Marina del Rey, California  90292-6695
<br>Phone: (213) 822-1511
<br>Electronic mail: JKREY@ISI.EDU

<p>
<h4>10.  The FYI Announcement List</h4>

<p>
New FYIs are announced to the RFC distribution list maintained by the
SRI Network Information Center (NIC).  Contact the SRI-NIC to be
added or deleted from this mailing list by sending an email message
to RFC-REQUEST@NIC.DDN.MIL.

<p>
<h4>11.  Obtaining FYIs</h4>

<p>
FYIs can be obtained via FTP from NIC.DDN.MIL, with the pathname
FYI:mm.TXT, or RFC:RFCnnnn.TXT (where "mm" refers to the number of
the FYI and "nnnn" refers to the number of the RFC).  Login with FTP,
username ANONYMOUS and password GUEST.  The NIC also provides an
automatic mail service for those sites which cannot use FTP.  Address
the request to SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL and in the subject field of the
message indicate the FYI or RFC number, as in "Subject: FYI mm" or
"Subject: RFC nnnn".
