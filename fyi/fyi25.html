<h3>1.   Introduction</h3></a>
<p>

As the network has grown, along with it there has been an increase in
the number of software tools and applications to navigate the network
and make use of the many, varied resources which are part of the
network.  Within the past two and a half years we have seen a
widespread adoption of tools such as the archie servers, the Wide
Area Information Servers (WAIS), the Internet gopher, and the
Worldwide Web (WWW).  In addition to the acceptance of these tools
there are also diverse efforts to enhance and customise these tools
to meet the needs of particular network communities.
<p>

There are many organisations and associations that are focusing on
the proliferating resources and tools for networked information
retrieval (NIR).  The Networked Information Retrieval Group is a
cooperative effort of three major players in the field of NIR: The
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Association of European
Research Networks (RARE) and the Coalition for Networked Information
(CNI), specifically tasked to collect and disseminate information
about the tools and to discuss and encourage cooperative development
of current and future tools.
<p>

The purpose of this report is to increase the awareness of NIR by
bringing together in one place information about the various
networked information retrieval tools, their developers, interested
organisations, and other activities that relate to the production,
dissemination, and support of NIR tools.  The intention is to make
this a "living document".  It will be held on-line so that each
section may be updated separately as appropriate.  In addition, it is
intended that the full document will be updated once a year so that
it provides a "snapshot" report on activities in this area.
<p>

Whilst the NIR tools in this report are being used on a wide variety
of information sources including files and databases there remains
much that is currently not accessible by these means.  On the other
hand, the majority of the NIR Tools described here are freely
available to the networked Research and Education community.  Tools
for accessing specialised datasets are often only available at a
cost.
<p>

It should be noted that in many ways networked information retrieval
is in its infancy compared with traditional information retrieval
systems.  Thesaurus construction, boolean searching and
classification control are issues which are under discussion for the
popular NIR Tools but as yet are not in widespread use.  However it
should be said that, with the vast amount of effort that is currently
going into the NIR field, rapid progress is being made.  Much work is
currently being done on expanding some of the NIR tools to include
handling of multimedia information services.  Progress has also been
made in the discussions on classifying and cataloguing electronic
information resources.

<a name="how">
<h3>2.  How the information was collected</h3></a>
<p>

The information contained in this report was collected over the
network from the contacts for each NIR Tool or Group using two
templates:
<p>
<ul>
<li> the NIR Tool Template, included in Appendix A;
<li> the NIR Group Template, included in Appendix B.
</ul>
<p>

The contents of these templates were discussed by the NIR WG in
Boston (July, 1992) and subsequently on the email list.  (See the
Section on the NIR-WG for details of how to join this mailing list.)
The initial draft report was discussed at the NIR Working Group in
Washington (November, 1992) and updated and added to at subsequent WG
meetings.  Before the final submission as an RFC the individual
templates were reviewed by independent reviewers from around the
world.  Their efforts are acknowledged in Section 9.
<p>

The NIR Tool template was used to collect the information necessary
to identify and track the development of networked information
retrieval tools.  This template asked for information such as how and
where to get the software for each NIR Tool, documentation,
demonstration sites, etc.  The main part of the template has been
completed by the main individual responsible for the tool.  Sections
of the template (e.g., on clients) may have required completion by
others.
<p>

The NIR Group template requested information on the aim and purpose
of the group, the current tasks being undertaken, mailing lists,
document archives, etc.

<h3>5.  Overview of the types of NIR Tools</h3></a>
<p>

The following is an overview of major networked information retrieval
(NIR) tools available on the Internet.  There are many excellent
books which discuss the Internet and NIR Tools in detail.  Such books
include "The Whole Internet User's Guide and Catalog" by Ed Krol and
published by O'Reilly and Associates, Inc and "The Internet Guide for
New Users" by Daniel Dearn and published by Meckler.
<p>

The number of these NIR tools is large and growing quickly.  Certain
techniques reappear regularly and seemingly different tools may
perform similar tasks, allowing a simple classification of projects
encompassing most of the existing tools and services.
<p>

The classification presented here is only one possible ordering.  The
goal is to define in broad outlines what can be done with particular
tools, realizing that users will always find novel unanticipated ways
of applying them.
<p>

<h4>Interactive Information Delivery Services (Gopher, World Wide Web)</h4>
<p>

Basic Internet services such as electronic mail and anonymous FTP
can be used to share information across the Internet, but neither
allows simple browsing and neither is particularly easy for the
newcomer to learn to use.  Gopher and the World Wide Web (W3) are
two recent developments that attempt to make it easier to
distribute information over the Internet.  Both allow the user to
browse information across the network without the necessity of
logging in or knowing in advance where to look for information.
<p>

The Gopher project was first developed at the University of
Minnesota to provide a simple campus-wide on-line information
system.  Gopher represents information as a simple hierarchy of
menus and files.  It has limited capability to recognize different
types of files, allowing, for example, the display of selected
types of image files.  Gateways to other services are provided
(usually in a manner that is transparent to the user).  The
underlying Gopher protocol is simple, and has facilitated the
creation of freely available clients for use on a variety of
hardware platforms and operating systems.  The more recent Gopher+
protocol adds the ability to provide documents in alternate forms
(PDF, PostScript, RTF, Word).  These features and the ease of
installing and administering gopher servers has led to an
explosive growth of gopher sites since its initial deployment.  As
of November 1993, there were over 2200 known servers.
<p>

World Wide Web relies on hypertext; formatted documents are
displayed, and hypertext links within the document can be selected
to travel from the current document to another.  W3 allows a user
to annotate documents (using hypertext links), provides gateways
to other services, and has multimedia support (for example, on
appropriate hardware platforms it can intermix text and images in
a displayed document).  There is a range of free W3 clients,
supporting many environments.  World Wide Web was originally
developed at CERN for the High Energy Physics Community.
<p>

Gopher and WWW share a maintenance problem in that there is no
automated way to update links to other documents when those
documents are moved or removed.
<p>

<h4>Directory Services (WHOIS, X.500)</h4>
<p>

Directory Service tools are intended to provide a lookup service
for locating information about users (often referred to as White
Pages), or services and service providers (Yellow Pages).  For
example, a White Pages service might be used to locate an
electronic mail address, given a name and organization, while a
Yellow Pages service could be used to locate an online library
catalog or file archive site.
<p>

One of the first directory services deployed on the Internet was
WHOIS, a simple White Pages service created to track key network
contacts for the early DARPA-sponsored incarnation of the
Internet.  A number of sites currently operate WHOIS servers,
based on a range of extensions and enhancements to the original
model.  WHOIS enjoys the advantages of simplicity and the presence
of WHOIS client software on a preponderance of Internet-connected
hosts.  Work is underway on a more powerful protocol, known as
WHOIS++, which is backwards-compatible with WHOIS.
<p>

The X.500 Directory Service is a much more ambitious Directory
project that has been under development for a number of years
under the aegis of ISO/OSI.  Implementations, concerned primarily
with White pages services, are available in the public domain and
from commercial sources.  There are LDAP based X.500 clients
available for most major platforms, as well as a LDAP based gopher
gateway to X.500.
<p>

Despite years of effort, there is still no single White Pages
Directory Service for the entire Internet; Yellow Pages services
remain even less well developed and deployed.  The cost of setting
up the service is one obstacle; maintaining the required databases
is even more daunting.
<p>

<h4>Indexing Services (archie, Veronica, online library catalogs)</h4>
<p>

There are several Internet-based projects that build indexed
catalogs of information to facilitate searching and retrieval.
The first such services provided network access to library card
catalogs, with more recent projects indexing network-based
information.
<p>

<b>archie:</b>
<p>

The archie service began as a simple project to catalog the
contents of hundreds of ftp-accessible online file archives.  The
archie service gathers location information, name, and other
details describing such files and creates an index database.
<p>

Users can contact an archie server and search this database for
files they require.
<p>

The archie service is accessible through a range of access
methods, including telnet, stand-alone client programs running on
a user's own machine, gopher, WWW, or via electronic mail.  The
initial implementation of archie tracks over 2,100,000 filenames
on over 1,200 sites around the world (as of November 1993).  There
are about 30 (geographically distributed) archie servers.  Both
commercial and freely available versions of the archie client
software are available.
<p>

Work continues on extending the archie service to provide
additional types of information.  The latest version is being used
to provide a prototype Yellow Pages service and directories of
online library catalogs and electronic mailing lists.
<p>

<b>Veronica:</b>
<p>

Veronica arose as an attempt to do for the world of Gopher what
archie did for the world of ftp.  A central server periodically
scans the complete menu hierarchies of Gopher servers appearing on
an ever-expanding list (over 2000 sites as of November 1993).  The
resulting index is provided by a veronica server and can be
accessed by any gopher client.
<p>

<b>Online library catalogs:</b>
<p>

A large number of libraries make their computerized library
catalogs available over the Internet.  Most are available through
telnet sessions in which the user connects to a specific address
and logs in using a specific login name.  Some are also available
through other tools, such as Gopher.
<p>

<b>Text-based Indexing Services (WAIS)</b>
<p>

<b>WAIS:</b>
<p>

Wide Area Information Servers (WAIS) is a system for indexing and
serving information in a network-based environment.  It is
distinct from indexing tools such as archie and veronica in that
it is used to index text-based target documents on a server, as
well as descriptions of the contents of a server.
<p>

A WAIS server allows the administrator to set up an index of the
documents (or resources) to be published.  The user employs a WAIS
client to attach to a particular WAIS server, and specifies a
search pattern which is matched against the server's index.  In
early WAIS clients, searches are specified as simple natural-
language queries; common ("stop") words are removed, and Boolean
"ORs" are implicitly added between the remaining list of words.
Matching documents are rank-ordered according to a simple
statistical weighting scheme which attempts to indicate likely
relevance.  The user may choose to view selected documents, or
further refine the search.  The results of one search may be used
to successively refine future searches ("relevance feedback").
Gopher clients can also access WAIS servers via a transparent
gateway.
<p>

Both freely available and commercial versions of WAIS servers and
clients are available.  Current work is attempting to add Boolean
expressions and proximity and field specifications to queries.
<p>

There are currently (as of November 1993) some 500 registered WAIS
databases with an estimated 2000 additional databases that are not
yet registered.  There are approximately another 100 commercial
WAIS databases.

<h4>NIR Tool Name:      Alex</h4></a>
<p>

Brief Description of Tool:
<p>

OVERVIEW:
<p>

The Alex filesystem provides users and applications transparent
read access to files in anonymous FTP sites on the Internet.
Today there are thousands of anonymous FTP sites with a total of a
few millions of files and roughly a terabyte of data.  The
standard approach to accessing these files involves logging in to
the remote machine.  This means that an application can not access
remote files like local files.  This also means that users do not
have any of their aliases or local tools available.  Users who
want to use an application on a remote file first have to manually
make a local copy of the file.  There is no mechanism for
automatically updating this local copy when the remote file
changes.  The users must keep track of where they get their files
from and check to see if there are updates, and then fetch these.
In this approach many different users at the same site may have
made copies of the same remote file each using up disk space for
the same data.
<p>

Alex addresses the problems with the existing approach while
remaining within the existing FTP protocol so that the large
collection of currently available files can be used.  To get
reasonable performance long term file caching is used.  Thus
consistency is an issue.  Traditional solutions to the cache
consistency problem do not work in the Internet FTP domain:
callbacks are not an option as the FTP protocol has no provisions
for this and polling over the Internet is slow.  Therefore, Alex
relaxes file cache consistency semantics, on a per file basis, and
uses special caching algorithms that take into account the
properties of the files and of the network to allow a simple
stateless filesystem to scale to the size of the Internet.
<p>

USER'S VIEW:
<p>

To a user or application, Alex is just a normal filesystem.  Any
command that works on local files will work on Alex files.  Since
Alex is a real filesystem, nothing needs to be recompiled and no
libraries are changed.  Thus, users can apply all of their
existing skills and tools for using files.
<p>

The user sees a filesystem with a hierarchical name space.  At the
top level (/alex) there are top-level Internet domains like "edu",
"com", "uk", and "jp".  Each component of the hostname becomes a
directory name. Then the remote path is added at the end.  If the
user does a "ls /alex/edu/berkeley" he sees some machine names
such as "ucbvax" and "sprite" and some directories on
berkeley.edu.  From the "ls" it is not clear what is where.  The
user may or may not be aware of host boundaries.
<p>

INFORMATION PROVIDER'S VIEW:
<p>

Alex is implemented as a user level NFS server.  NFS was chosen
because it makes it easy to add Alex to a wide range of machines.
Most machines can simply use the mount command.
<p>

The model of usage is that there is one Alex server running at
each institution (though this is not required in any way).  Users
mount the local server which caches files for users at that site.
<p>

Any information put into any anonymous FTP site becomes available
via Alex.

<dd>The archie system is a tool for gathering, indexing and serving
information from around the Internet.  The current version serves a
collection of filenames found at anonymous FTP sites, as well as a
smaller collection of text descriptions for software, data and other
information found at anonymous FTP archives.  Additional databases
are under development.
</dl><p>
<dl>
<dt>User's View:
<dd>Users run a client program to connect to an archie server and
issue search commands to find information in an archie database.
In the case of an anonymous FTP filename, this information can
then be used to fetch the file directly from the archive site
using the `ftp' command.  To the user, archie could be seen as a
`secondary source' of information which, because of the high cost
of locating and serving, would not otherwise be available.
</dl>
<p>

The user searches the archie databases through either a telnet
session to a machine running an archie server, or by using a
stand-alone client program (which uses the Prospero protocol for
sending and receiving requests).  There is also an email interface
which allows users to send and receive search requests via
electronic mail.
<p>

Freely available archie clients exist for most operating systems
and can be fetched using anonymous FTP from most of the current
archie servers.  There are also gateways to the archie system from
many other NIR tools, including Gopher, WAIS and WWW.  An X.500
interface to archie is currently under development.
<p>
<dl>
<dt>Information Provider's View:
<dd>There are two types of information providers who would be
interested in archie.  Primary information providers are
interested in having a summary of the information provided by
their service tracked by an archie server.  Secondary service
providers, or those sites wishing to provide a "value-added"
service for the Internet can elect to run an archie server at
their site to provide a useful service to users, to raise the
profile of their institution on the Internet, or to provide market
differentiation (for commercial service providers).
</dl>
<p>

The archie system is of particular utility serving information
where there are many sites to be searched and/or where the cost of
searching each site is high.
<p>

For example, there are currently over 1,200 anonymous FTP sites on
the Internet, and the number continues to grow.  Searching for a
specific filename at a single site may involve scanning hundreds,
or even thousands of filenames.  Thus, most operators of anonymous
FTP archives welcome the fact that archie indexes and serves the
names of all files available from each site tracked.
<p>
<dl>
<dt>Information Types Supported:
<dd>The archie system allows the gathering and serving of arbitrary
information types, although the current system serves only
freeform text and a dedicated text format for filename listings.
Internally, the archie system now supports a WAIS search engine
and frontends for Gopher, WWW and WHOIS++ for accessing archie
information through Gopher clients is now being tested.
Additional collections of information to be served by the archie
software will be announced.

Protocols:
<p>
What is supported:
<p>
The current archie system clients use the Prospero protocol for
communication with the search engine on the archie server.  Freely
available clients are available which include source to perform
this communication for those wishing to implement additional
clients.
<p>

The archie server is capable of building arbitrary databases,
using arbitrary search and access engines and the current release
ships with the public domain implementation of WAIS.  We expect
future archie servers to serve information using this protocol.
The current server system assumes the TCP/IP protocol suite is
available, and in particular the ftp protocol for data gathering.
<p>

The archie system can be accessed through systems operating the
Gopher, WAIS and WWW (HDDL) protocols.  A gateway from the X.500
system is under development.
<p>
<dl>
<dt>What it runs over:
<dd>The Prospero protocol implementation runs over its own
implementation of a reliable datagram protocol based upon UDP.
Data gathering runs over the TCP/IP protocol suite.
</dl>
<p>
<dl>
<dt>Other NIR tools this interworks with:
<dd>Prospero, Gopher, WAIS, WWW.
</dl>
<p>

<dl>
<dt>Future plans:
<dd>The archie system became a commercial product in October, 1992,
marketed by Bunyip Information Systems Inc.  The company plans to
market additional data gathering modules to allow the server code
to build additional types of databases.  Work is also underway to
integrate extensions to WHOIS to allow the building and
maintaining of White Pages (names) directories.  The company is
also working on other Internet information tools that will work
with the archie system.

<ul>
<li> telnet to any of the above sites
<li> login as user `archie' (no password is required)
<li> type `help' at the prompt to get started.

Note:  Some people forget and use ftp in place of telnet. This will
not work. The hint that this is being done is that they claim
that a password is needed, not that the site can't be found.

<a name="gopher">
<h4>NIR Tool Name:  Internet Gopher</h4></a>
<p>

<dl>
<dt>Brief Description of Tool:
<dd>The Internet Gopher protocol is a client/distributed-server document
search and retrieval protocol originally developed at the University
of Minnesota.  Gopher was originally created as a fast, simple,
distributed, campus-wide information search and retrieval system;
ease of use and implementation has made Gopher increasingly popular
on the Internet.  Since its original release, many folks on the
Internet have contributed to its growth, submitting patches, servers,
clients, and linking their local servers into the worldwide network
of Gopher servers.  Gateways exist to seamlessly access a variety of
non-Gopher services such as ftp, WAIS, USENET news, Archie, Z39.50
(1992 rev), X.500 directories, Sybase and Oracle SQL servers, etc.
In addition, an "archie for gopherspace" called Veronica (very easy
rodent-oriented net-wide index to computerized archives) has been
developed at the University of Nevada.  Veronica makes it easy to
search for items in gopherspace by title.
<p>

The gopher protocol is often described as "fiercely simple"; it is
connectionless (stateless), and uses TCP reliable streams.  A client
connects to a server using TCP, and sends a one-line text "selector
string".  The server responds by returning the item (a file, a
directory listing, or a link to some other service) corresponding to
the selector string and immediately closing the connection.  Items in
directory listings are returned as a series of lines terminated by
carriage-return line-feed.  Each item (line) is defined by a one-
character tag to specify the item type, a display string or item-name
that the client should display to the user, and a number of tab
delimited fields to specify the selector string, host domain name and
port number.  Because of its simple and connectionless nature, gopher
servers make very minimal demands on their host machines and gopher
clients are extremely easy to implement.
<p>

The users view the Gopher world as a series of networked hierarchical
directories much like a familiar filesystem.  However, the links
define a graph rather than a simple rooted tree.  Links in the Gopher
graph may define services other than simple files or directories;
these include cso (qi) servers, telnet sessions, links to other
gopher servers, and links to gateway servers.
<p>

The information provider's simplest view is that files and
directories below a certain root directory on their machine are all
visible and available for retrieval by gopher clients.  More features
like long names, item types, links, and gateway services are
available to the more sophisticated information provider.
<p>

Servers and clients run on most popular hardware, including Macs,
UNIX boxes, PC-DOS boxes.  The Internet Gopher name is copyright (c)
1991-1992 by the University of Minnesota.  The Internet Gopher
protocol is described in an informational RFC (1436) available at
better RFC archives everywhere.  Extensions to the base gopher
protocol allow for associating meta-information with gopher items,
alternate views of documents (i.e., text, postscript, rtf, etc.) and
electronic forms.  Collectively, these extensions are referred to as
Gopher+.  Gopher+ is upward compatible with the orginal gopher
protocol.  The gopher software may be retrieved from numerous Gopher
or FTP archive sites, including the University of Minnesota Gopher
server, the Info-Mac Archive Gopher server, and by anonymous FTP from
boombox.micro.umn.edu and sumex-aim.stanford.edu. As of December
1993, about 1/3 of the approximately 4800 Gopher servers on the
internet support Gopher+.

<h4>NIR Tool Name: Netfind</h4></a>
<p>

<dl>
<dt>Brief Description of Tool:
<dd>Given the name of a person on the Internet and a rough description of
where the person works, Netfind attempts to locate information about
the person.  People can be specified by first, last, or login name.
Their place of work can be described by name and/or the
city/state/country.
<p>

Netfind provides textual information about people, when it is able to
locate such information.  It is not a directory in the usual sense of
the word.  Rather, it searches for people using a number of Internet
services and heuristics about how to locate user information.
Because of the techniques it uses, Netfind can locate information
about more people than any other Internet user directory - over 5
million people in over 9,000 domains worldwide when last measured.
<p>

You can use the University of Colorado Netfind server by telnet to
bruno.cs.colorado.edu: login as "netfind" (with no password).  Help
screens providing more detailed instructions and technical
information are available there.  There is currently no way for non-
Internet users to access Netfind (e.g., using an email interface).

<h4>NIR Tool Name: Prospero</h4></a>
<p>

<dl>
<dt>Brief Description of Tool:
<dd>The Prospero directory service supports a user centered view of files
scattered across the Internet.  It can be used to organize references
to files as if they were on your local system, without the need to
physically move them.
<p>

Prospero provides access to existing directories and indices that can
be used to find files of interest that are available from Internet
archive sites.  Among the indices available is the archie database
and a gateway to all Gopher menus, files, and searches.  We hope to
have WAIS indices and World Wide Web documents online in the near
future.
<p>

Prospero also provides a mechanism to make directories and indices
available to end-users and applications in a format that allows
information from different sources to be integrated into a coherent
whole.
<p>

Prospero does not interpret the data that it organizes.  It does
provide mechanisms to retrieve the data, but the display and use of
the data is up to the user's application.  Prospero is intended to
serve as infrastructure that integrates information from a variety of
sources and supports a variety of user applications.
<p>

Prospero allows fine grained authorization of requests to all
objects, including directories and indices.  Prospero supports the
authentication of clients through four mechanisms: (a) simple client
assertion of the user's identity; (b) a trusted port mechanism
similar to that used by the Berkeley UNIX R commands; (c) a simple
cleartext passwording mechanism; (d) Kerberos (version 5).  The
maintainer of an ACL chooses which of these mechanisms he or she
wishes to accept as proof of the client's identity.

<p>

Note that the name prospero.tar.Z refers to the most stable release
(currently Beta version 5.1).  If you want the latest version of
the server (which includes the Gopher gateway), you should retrieve
it by version number; the name for the latest version is

<p>

Latest version number:
Alpha Version 5.3
<p>

<dt>Brief Scope and Characteristics:
<dd>The server allows the maintainer to make directory information
available about selected portions of the server's filesystem, such as
anonymously FTPable files.  The server also is used to publish
information from other databases, such as Archie.  The server also
allows users and maintainers to store their own customized organizing
views of the namespace.  Release Alpha.5.2 of the server includes a
gateway feature which treats all Gopher servers as a Prospero
database.
<p>

<dt>Approximate number of such servers in use:
<dd>50
<p>

General comments:
<p>

<dt>Future plans:
<dd>We have a prototype NFS server that makes Prospero queries, but it is
not yet ready to release.  We plan to develop a gateway similar to
the existing Gopher gateway feature for World Wide Web.  There is
also active work being done on exporting WAIS indices through
Prospero in a way similar to the way the archie database is exported.

<p>

Latest Version number:
Alpha Version 5.2
<p>

<dt>Brief Scope and Characteristics:
<dd>We provide two client interfaces.  The older one is a command-line
client, which can be configured to use the same syntax to navigate
through the Prospero namespace that a user uses to navigate through
the UNIX filesystem.  ("cd", "ls", etc.) The newer one is a menu-
based file and directory browser similar to the UNIX Gopher client.
<p>

<dt>General comments:
<dd>Archie clients also make queries in the Prospero namespace, so all
Archie clients are Prospero clients too.  They are better described
in the Archie report.
<p>

<dt>Future plans:
<dd>We are working on enhancing the menu browser client to allow users to
remotely customize and update virtual systems.  We plan to develop a
Prospero hypertext browser.
<p>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<p>

<dt>Demonstration sites:
<dd>A guest virtual system is available on PROSPERO.ISI.EDU.  However, to
use it, you must compile the Prospero command-line client on your own
machine.  Instructions for using it come with the Prospero
distribution.

For the readers of this report, this is the first paper you probably
want to read about Prospero.  This paper describes how Prospero can
be used to integrate internet information services, including
Gopher, WAIS, Archie, and World Wide Web.  The paper was
presented at INET'93 in August.

This is the first paper we give to more general computer science
audiences to read.  It's also a good first paper to look at.  It
gives a good overview of Prospero and what it does.  It also
describes a bit about the Virtual System model, of which Prospero is
a prototype implementation.  Describes what Prospero does, not how
it does it.

This is a good third paper to read about Prospero.  This one is
targeted more toward system implementors.  It provides more
implementation details than the paper on organizing Internet
resources, but less of the vision of how Prospero can be used together
with other systems.

This paper describes the reasons that operating systems need to
support closure, that is they need to make it clear which name space
is to be used when resolving names.  While closure is one of the
important features of Prospero, the concept should be applied in other
operating systems too.

This is Clifford Neuman's Ph.D. Dissertation.  It is currently the
definitive work on Prospero and the Virtual System Model.  Includes
an obsolete version of the Prospero User's Manual and of the Prospero
Protocol Specification.

<p>

<dt>Other Information:
<dd>We provide three documented library interfaces to Prospero in order to
make client writing easy.
<p>

The PFS and PCOMPAT libraries are documented in the library reference
manual.  The PFS library allows one to directly make Prospero requests
and parse the results and to manipulate Prospero objects as
abstractions.  The PCOMPAT library is an interface to the PFS library
which uses the same interface as the UNIX filesystem; one can link
many existing programs with the PCOMPAT library in order to get it to
resolve names in the Prospero namespace.  It is not as portable as the
PFS library and does not provide as much functionality.
<p>

The third library interface is the menu-browser API library.  It is
documented in the menu-based browser API manual and is used by our
menu-based browser.

<dt>Brief Description of Tool:
<dd>veronica: Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Net-wide Index to Computerized
Archives.
<p>

veronica is the comprehensive title-index of the world's gopher
servers.  Because of veronica, the Gopher web is a search-and-
retrieval system as well as a browsing system.  veronica is popular
because the ubiquitous Gopher client can both access the search
server, and provide immediate access to the discovered resources.
Taking advantage of Gopher's linked menus, and of the policy of open
access at most gopher sites, veronica finds and indexes almost all
items on publicly-accessible gopher servers.
<p>

As of February, 1994, veronica holds indexes to more than 3200 gopher
servers on approximately 2500 internet hosts.  In February 1994 the
public-access veronica sites served an estimated 1,200,000 queries.
Most queries are resolved in less than twenty seconds.  Eight server
sites offer searches to the internet community, and several other
institutions run servers for internal access.
<p>

veronica is easily accessed via any Gopher client.  It offers various
types of searches, ranging from single-keyword searches to boolean
queries of indefinite complexity.
<p>

A veronica search originates with a user's request for a search,
submitted from a gopher client.  The searches may include boolean
operators ( AND, OR, NOT, and parentheses ) and several options to
control the number of items returned, and to restrict the search to
certain gopher types.  The result of a veronica search is a set of
gopher-type data items, which is returned to the gopher client as a
gopher menu.  Each item on this menu contains the user's desired
keyword or keywords in the item title.
<p>

The user can access any of the gopher items by selecting from the
returned menu.  Items on this menu may be drawn from many gopher
servers.  Because veronica is accessed through gopher clients, it
provides immediate access to all types of data supported by the
gopher protocol and the client implementation.
<p>

The veronica service comprises two functions:
<p>

1) Harvesting menu data from gopher servers, and preparing it for
use;
2) Offering searches of that database to gopher clients.
<p>

These two functions are not necessarily provided by the same host
computer.  Currently collection and preparation of data are done at
University of Nevada, and datasets are distributed to the other
veronica servers.
<p>

The veronica service infrastructure has been fairly stable since
July, 1993, with eight server sites offering searches for the
internet community (March 1994).  These servers are supported by the
participating institutions: NYSERNET, PSI, SERRA, CNIDR, University
of Koeln, SUNET, University of Bergen and the University of Nevada
System Computing Services.  Several additional servers offer searches
with access limited to internal users; in this class are servers at
MSU, SUNET, and the Australian University system.
<p>

An auxiliary tool to build a locally held menu of Public available
has been created.  Called "maltshop", it has been distributed since
January, 1994.  It appears that maltshop is rapidly being accepted,
but its long-term effect on loading of the servers may be
problematic.

<p>

<dl>
<dt>Brief Scope and Characteristics:
<dd>Two modules:    a data-collection module and a data-server module.
</dl>
<p>

1.      Data-collector runs on any Unix computer that does TCP
and compiles perl.  This has not been distributed yet.
Data collection, data preparation, and indexing are being
done at veronica.scs.unr.edu.  The harvester "walks" all
advertised gopher servers, and any newly-discovered servers.
Almost all redundant links are removed, leaving the
( hopefully ) canonical reference for each item.
Indexes are built at Nevada, and the indexed dataset is
distributed to server sites.
<p>

2.      Server module.
<br>Servers run on unix computers and answer to gopher-type-7
requests.  Boolean keyword logic is implemented.  See file
"how-to-compose-veronica-queries".  Several options allow
retrieval of items with specified gopher-types, retrieval
of a file of links containing the search results, and
override for the default limit on number of results returned,
which is 200 items.
<p>

Server software runs on most flavors of unix, requires dbm
and perl, and requires about 1.4 GB of data on disk, with
considerable /tmp space available.
<p>

Server software is available to any site which wants to run
a server.  Server sites are encouraged to offer the service
to the net at large.
<p>

Approximate number of such servers in use:  twelve.
<p>

<br>Auxiliary tool:  Maltshop v. 0.2d
<br>Maltshop builds a menu of Public Gopher Servers for the local
gopher menu.

<p>

<dl>
<dt>General comments:
<dd>Basic veronica service has been fairly stable since July 1993.
Indexing is quite efficient, and most queries are resolved in ten
seconds or quicker.  More than 1,000,000 queries were resolved in
February, 1994.
</dl>
<p>

Though veronica is well-accepted at this level of service, we are
undertaking significant upgrade efforts during Winter 93-94.

<h4>NIR Tool Name:   WAIS</h4></a>
<p>

<dl>
<dt>Brief Description of Tool:
<dd>WAIS - The Wide Area Information Servers system - is an electronic
publishing software set which allows you to search out and retrieve
multimedia information from databases anywhere in the world.  WAIS
databases may be accessed by WAIS, gopher, and WWW clients (such as
Mosaic), and via online services such as Delphi and America OnLine.
WAIS software includes user interfaces for most platforms, and server
software that provides automatic indexing of databases.
<p>

WAIS was developed by Thinking Machines Corporation of Cambridge,
Massachusetts in collaboration with Apple Computer, Inc., Dow Jones  &amp 
Company, and KPMG Peat Marwick.  With over 100 databases and 5,000
users worldwide, WAIS is rapidly becoming a standard for information
distribution within the Internet environment.
<p>

WAIS is a client-server application.  Most of the clients remain
freely available with a few exceptions.  WAIS, Inc.  develops and
sells commercial versions of WAIS and the Clearinghouse for Networked
Information Discovery and Retrieval (CNIDR) develops freeWAIS, a
version free for distribution and use.  A few freely distributable
versions remain available from Thinking Machines, Inc.  and other
organizations.
<p>

<b>What does WAIS do?</b>
<p>

WAIS allows multimedia information to be stored anywhere on any
platform.  Using your interface of choice, WAIS enables you to
find personal, corporate and public information.  The information
is accessible regardless of format: text, formatted documents,
pictures, spreadsheets, graphics, sound, or video.
<p>

WAIS recognizes natural language queries. The search and retrieval
of relevant information is made using your native language.  To
date, we have used English, French, Italian, and Latin!  The most
relevant documents, regardless of size, can be sent back to the
server in their entirety to further refine your search (telling
the server, "Find me more like this document.") Proven searches
can be automatically repeated, monitoring and alerting you to new
information as it becomes available.
<p>

<b>How does WAIS work?</b>
<p>

WAIS uses a single computer-to-computer protocol (NISO Z39.50-
1988).  Each WAIS server reads your question and based on its
words, searches the full text of the database for the most
relevant documents, and ranks them using automatic word weighting.
Servers need not fully understand your query; the retrieval
process is based on a search method called relevance feedback.

with AIX ports of the wais-8-b5 or freeWAIS packages, if

<h4>NIR Tool Name: Whois</h4></a>
<p>

<dl>
<dt>Brief Description of Tool:
<dd>As currently defined, NICNAME/WHOIS services is a TCP transaction
based query/response server, running on a few specific central
machines, that provides netwide directory service to internet users.
Since the WHOIS service was defined in 1985, it has evolved into a
distributed service.
<p>

The InterNIC Registration Services is located at Network Solutions,
Inc., Herndon, VA, and is funded by a cooperative agreement from the
National Science Foundations to provide assistance in registering
networks, domains, asn's, and other entities to the Internet
community via telephone, electronic mail, and U.S. postal mail.
<p>

Databases and information servers of interest to network users are
provided, including the WHOIS registry of domains, networks, asn's
and their associated poc's.  Gopher and Wais interfaces are also
available for retrieving information and accessing whois.  Online
documents maintained at registration services include registration
related rfc's, registration templates, and various netinfo files.
Many of the online files are available through our automatic mail
service, MAILSERV@RS.INTERNIC.NET.  Whois queries can also be
directed to rs.internic.net.  From a host, use the TELNET program to
connect to host RS.INTERNIC.NET.  When greeted by the Registration
host, type "WHOIS" and press RETURN.
<p>

MAILSERV@RS.INTERNIC.NET is an automated service provided by InterNIC
Registration Services.  It allows access to documents and information
via ordinary electronic mail.  This is especially useful for users
who do not have access to the NIC via a direct Internet link, such as
users of BITNET, CSNET and UUCP sites.
<p>

To use the mail service, send a mail message to
MAILSERV@RS.INTERNIC.NET.  In the SUBJECT field, request the type of
service you wish followed by any needed arguments.  The message body
is normally ignored.  Large files will be broken into smaller
separate messages.  The information you request will be sent back to
you as soon as possible.
<p>

WHOIS xxx       Returns information about xxx from the WHOIS service.
Use "WHOIS HELP" for information on how to use WHOIS.
<p>

The MILNET Network Information Center, maintains the central NICNAME
database and server, providing online look-up of individuals, network
organizations, MILNET nodes, and other information of interest to
those involved in management of the Internet.  Whois queries can be
sent to nic.ddn.mil.

<h4>NIR Tool Name:            World-Wide Web</h4></a>
<p>

<dl>
<dt>Brief Description of Tool:
<dd>The WWW project merges the techniques of networked information and
hypertext to make an easy but powerful global information system.  W3
uses the concept of a seamless information space (the "web"), in
which all objects including those accessed by earlier protocols
(wais, gopher, ftp, etc.) exist.
<p>

The project allows information sharing within internationally
dispersed teams, and the dissemination of information by support
groups.  Originally aimed at the High Energy Physics community, it
has spread to other areas and attracted much interest in user
support, resource discovery and collaborative work areas.  It is
currently the most advanced information system deployed on the
Internet.
<p>

READER VIEW
<p>

The WWW world consists of documents, and links.  Indexes are
special documents which, rather than being read, may be searched.
The result of such a search is another ("virtual") document
containing links to the documents found.  A simple protocol ("
HTTP ") is used to allow a browser program to request a keyword
search by a remote information server.
<p>

The web contains documents in many formats.  Those documents which
are hypertext, (real or virtual) contain links to other documents,
or places within documents.  All documents, whether real, virtual
or indexes, look similar to the reader and are contained within
the same addressing scheme.
<p>

To follow a link, a reader clicks with a mouse (or types in a
number if he or she has no mouse).  To search and index, a reader
gives keywords (or other search criteria).  These are the only
operations necessary to access the entire world of data.
<p>

INFORMATION PROVIDER VIEW
<p>

The WWW browsers can access many existing data systems via
existing protocols (FTP, NNTP) or via HTTP and a gateway.  In this
way, the critical mass of data is quickly exceeded, and the
increasing use of the system by readers and information suppliers
encourage each other.
<p>

Providing information is as simple as running the W3 server and
pointing it at an existing directory structure.  The server
automatically generates the hypertext view of your files to guide
the user around.
<p>

To personalize it, you can write a few SGML hypertext files to
give an even more friendly view.  Also, any file available by
anonymous FTP, or any internet newsgroup can be immediately linked
into the web.  The very small start-up effort is designed to allow
small contributions.  At the other end of the scale, large
information providers may provide an HTTP server with full text or
keyword indexing.  This may allow access to a large existing
database without changing the way that database is managed.  Such
gateways have already been made into Oracle(tm), WAIS, and
Digital's VMS/Help systems, to name but a few.
<p>

The WWW model gets over the frustrating incompatibilities of data
format between suppliers and reader by allowing negotiation of
format between a smart browser and a smart server.  This should
provide a basis for extension into multimedia, and allow those who
share application standards to make full use of them across the
web.
<p>

This summary does not describe the many exciting possibilities
opened up by the WWW project, such as efficient document caching.
The reduction of redundant out-of-date copies, and the use of
knowledge daemons.  There is more information in the online
project documentation, including some background on hypertext and
many technical notes.
<p>

GETTING STARTED
<p>

You can bootstrap yourself into the web by telnetting to
info.cern.ch (no user or password). You can try a full screen
interface "Lynx" by telnetting to ukanaix.cc.ukans.edu, login in
as "www".  You can also find out more about WWW in this way.
These are the least sophisticated browsers -- remember that the
window-oriented ones are much smarter!  It is much more efficient
to install a browser on your own machine, and you have many more
facilities.
<p>

If you have an X-windows based workstation, PC or Mac just FTP to
FTP.NCSA.UIUC.EDU and get the binary of NCSA's "Mosaic" browser in
directory /Web/Mosaic-binaries. Download it, uncompress it, set it
executable, and run it.  It will tell you all you need to know.
<p>

Mosaic is now available for PCs and Apple Macs.
<p>

If you have an MSDOS machine with Windows, you could try the
"Cello" browser from FATTY.LAW.CORNELL.EDU in directory
/pub/LII/Cello.
<p>

The line mode browser is currently available in source form by
anonymous FTP from node info.cern.ch [currently 128.141.201.74] if
you take both files
<p>

/pub/www/src/WWWLibrary_v.vv.tar.Z.
/pub/www/src/WWWLineMode_v.vv.tar.Z.
<p>

(v.vv is the version number - take the latest.)
<p>

Also available is a hypertext editor for the NeXT (in
/pub/www/bin/next), the MidasWWW and ViolaWWW browsers for X11, an
alpha-test Mac browser, and and a basic server
(/pub/www/src/WWWDaemon_v.vv.tar.Z).  Documentation, including the
latest list of software available , is readable using www.  A plain
text version of the installation instructions is included in the tar
file!
<p>

Printable (postscript) documentation and articles are in /pub/www/doc
on info.cern.ch.

<b>X.500 White Pages</b>

<h4>NIR Tool Name: X.500</h4></a>
<p>

<dl>
<dt>Brief Description of Tool:
<dd>X.500 is an international standard designed to provide a distributed
global directory service.  It is primarily used today to provide
'White Pages' services, although other types of services which have
directory components (automated mail aliasing, for example) are
beginning to be run over X.500.  In addition to information about
people and organizations, the Directory also contains a pilot K-12
Directory, pilot Information Resource information, and some other
non-White Pages information.  X.500 contains a number of security
features, which are implemented on different paradigms in the various
servers.
<p>

<dt>User's View:
<dd>Users (either human or electronic) run a client program to connect
to a local X.500 server.  Since X.500 is distributed, it appears
that the entire global X.500 directory is available from the local
server.  From this server connection, the user can add, delete, or
modify information held by the Directory, or issue powerful search
commands to locate individuals or other information.
<p>

The first solid version of the X.500 protocol was released in
1988, and has been the subject of much research in the past 5
years.  Consequently, there are a large number of clients, for
almost every platform, and a healthy number of servers.  There are
mail interfaces to some parts of the X.500 directory, and there is
a X.500 to Gopher gateway.  An X.500 interface to archie is
currently under development, as well as an X.500 to WWW interface.
<p>

<dt>Information Provider's View:
<dd>X.500 provides a set of mechanisms to allow distributed location
of, maintenance of, and access to a large set of data.  However,
current servers force a hierarchical view on the location of the
data, so it may not be suitable for all applications.  Also, the
X.500 directory is today unable to provide access to information
at a rate which would allow 'real-time' applications (such as
keeping routing information in the directory).
<p>

Also, there is a great effort underway to reduce the startup costs
of X.500 access by providing a lightweight X.500 access protocol
for client-server applications.  This work is detailed in RFC
1487:
<p>

"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol", by Yeong, Howes, and
Kille.  This protocol is expected to make the cost of entry for a
service provider much less that it has been.
<p>

<dt>Information Types Supported:
<dd>X.500 allows information to be served in an attribute:value
paradigm, with related attributes grouped into 'objects'. Each
entry in the directory can be described by multiple objects.
Attributes can have values which are text strings, dereferenceable
file names, or text-encoded photographs, and experimentation is
underway to keep digitally encoded sounds in the directory.

Description of main group:
<p>

The Coalition for Networked Information was founded in March 1990 to
help realize the promise of high performance networks and computers
for the advancement of scholarship and the enrichment of intellectual
productivity.  The Coalition is a partnership of the Association of
Research Libraries (ARL), CAUSE, and EDUCOM.  ARL is dedicated to
equitable access to, and effective use of, recorded knowlege in
support of teaching, research, scholarship, and community service,
and CAUSE and EDUCOM are dedicated to different aspects of the
introduction, use, and management of information technology and
related resources in research and education in general and higher
education in particular.  The Coalition pursues its mission with the
assistance of a task force that provides a common vehicle by which
more than 190 institutions and organizations are exploring a shared
vision of how information management must change in the 1990s to meet
the social and economic opportunities and challenges of the 21st
century.  Members of the Coalition Task Force include, among others,
higher education institutions, publishers, network service providers,
computer hardware, software, and systems companies, library networks
and organizations, and public and state libraries. A truly diverse
collaboration of institutions and organizations.

Program priorities are 1) to facilitate a consistent and complete
mechanism for linking bibliographic, abstracting, and indexing files
to files of their associated source materials; 2) a single standard
for the transmission of bitmapped image files; 3) protocols for
handling networked requests for delivery of source materials; 4)
mechanisms for interorganizational authentication, accounting, and
billing; and 5) to integrate lessons drawn from the experience of
pilot projects that exercise networked printing utilities and 6) to
provide an "interoperability workshop" to specify, implement, and
test advanced functions of Z39.50 to accelerate the pace and to
ensure the quality of standardization efforts in this area.

Description of main group:
<p>

This group recognizes the need for open systems, standards, and
therefore, interoperable products and services based upon a
distributed architecture of servers that draw upon a common or at
least comparable set of data elements.  It is creating a (printed
and networked) directory of directories and resource information
services that provide qualitative (consumer) as well as descriptive
information.  The group supports the Library of Congress effort to
enhance the MARC formats to account for the cataloging requirements of
networked resources and services, and the National Science Foundation
effort to procure a new NSFNet Network Information Center.

Description of main group:
<p>

(from ARL Newsletter #164 -- September 9, 1992)
<p>

The Coalition's TopNode Project is creating a directory of
directories, catalogs and aids of networked information resources,
services and tools.  The project is intended to facilitate the
network navigational duties, responsibilities and tasks of staff
in libraries, computer centers, networking offices and other
similar operations.  The primary product of the TopNode project
will be a set of records describing these networked information
resources, records that can be loaded into a wide range of
database management systems.
<p>

Based on their response to a Call for Statements of Interest and
Experience, Indiana University and Merit Network, Inc.  were
chosen to lead the development effort on the Coalition TopNode
project.  Pete Percival, Manager, Academic Information Environment
at Indiana University and Craig Summerhill, Coalition Systems
Coordinator, have completed the design for the database structure
which is being built on the Coalition's Internet fileserver using
BRS/SEARCH.  Based on earlier work of the leaders of the
Directories and Resource Information Services Working Group,
George Brett II of the University of North Carolina General
Administration and Peggy Seiden of Skidmore College Library,
Percival and Summerhill have developed a data structure that they
believe to be both flexible and responsive to the needs of the
many interested parties who have been consulted.
<p>

Under the direction of Gary Charbonneau of the Indiana University
Libraries, records are being created and prepared for loading.  A
thesaurus of added descriptor terms is being maintained.  As of
mid-August 1992, close to 200 records had been verified and had
received descriptive cataloging.
<p>

When the database is complete, libraries will be alerted and
encouraged to mount the TopNode records into their online
catalogs.  Records will be available from the Coalition.  In
addition, MERIT will use the TopNode database in an experiment to
test the viability of the X.500 directory format standard for
providing yellow pages-type services (e.g., with subject access).
After its initial release, the database will be maintained by
Indiana University libraries on the Coalition server; BRS has
assisted in the development of procedures for online data entry.

Description of main group:
<p>

Several user-friendly client-server software tools have  been
developed recently for locating and retrieving information
published on computer platforms reachable over wide-area data
communications networks like the Internet. Among them, freeWAIS
(freely available wide-area information system), the Internet
Gopher, archie, and the WorldWide Web (WWW) have become popular.
freeWAIS, archie, and Gopher indicate where information of
interest is likely to reside and then assist the user in locating
specific information. WWW permits a user to thread a path through
the network by selecting tagged hypertext items.
<p>

While focused on the evolution of wide-area information retrieval
systems, the Clearinghouse for Networked Information Discovery
and Retrieval (CNIDR) works closely with developers of other
tools toward providing compatibility, consistency, and, to the
extent possible, convergence of the tools.
<p>

Specific activities are to provide a central focus and forum for
networked information discovery and retrieval (NIDR) tools and to
minimize the divergence of individual implementations by
providing a repository for the collection, evaluation, and
distribution of protocol-compliant releases and enhanced
versions.
<p>

CNIDR participates in standards and policy associations such as
the Internet Engineering Task Force and the Coalition for
Networked Information, with the goal of increasing consensus
among developers and exploring appropriate uses of networked
information. CNIDR also actively promotes the use of networked
information discovery and retrieval tools at many national and
international conferences to inform and educate implementors and
end users.

<p>

Description of main group:
<p>

There are many organizations and associations that have begun to
focus on the proliferating resources and tools for networked
information retrieval (NIR).  The Networked Information Retrieval
Group will be a cooperative effort of three major players in the
field of NIR: IETF, RARE, and the Coalition for Networked Information
(CNI) specifically tasked to collect and disseminate information
about the tools and to discuss and encourage cooperative development
of current and future tools such as the archie servers, the Wide Area
Information Servers (WAIS), the Internet Gopher, and the WorldWide
Web (WWW).
<p>

The NIR Working Group intends to increase the useful base of
information about networked information retrieval (NIR) tools, their
developers, interested organizations, and other activities that
relate to the production, dissemination, and support of NIR tools.
<p>

Membership is open and is not limited to attendees of the quarterly
IETF meetings; the mailing list is open to all.  The NIR-WG charter
is available via anonymous ftp from the various IETF repositories as
nir-charter.txt.
<p>

Goals:
<p>

To disseminate information about NIR tools and those groups working
on them.  The information in the NIR Status report will be updated
and new entries added as appropriate once per year.  This report will
be submitted as an RFC.
<p>

Current work includes discussing the criteria for evaluating the
major NIR tools available.

<h4>NIR Group Name:    Uniform Resource Identifiers (uri)</h4></a>
<p>

Sponsoring Organisation: Internet Engineering Task Forces (IETF)
<p>

Working subgroups:    NONE
<p>

Description of main group:
<p>

The Uniform Resource Identifiers Archives Working Group is chartered
to define a set of standards for the encoding of system independent
Resource Location and Identification information for the use of
Internet information services.  There are three classes of
information being standardized in this group:
<p>

1)  Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), which specify a standardized
method for encoding location and access information to
resources across multiple information systems,
<p>

2)  Uniform Resource Names (URNs), which specify a standardized
method for encoding a unique resource identifier for a given
content, and
<p>

3)  Uniform Resource Citations (URCs), which specify a
standardized method for encoding information about a given
instantiation of a content.
<p>

The URLs allow an information service to give a user access and
location information for a resource.  The URN allows an information
service to determine if the contents of two information resources are
the same or not.  The URC allows an information service to select
which of a number of different encodings of a resource are
appropriate for a given user's retrieval capabilities, and may
contain such things as file size and compression techniques.
<p>

Membership is open, and is not limited to IETF attendees.  A full

Mailinglist-Address:  ietf-wnils@ucdavis.edu
<p>

Description of main group:
<p>

This description is the current WNILS-WG charter.
<p>

The Network Information Center (NIC) maintains the central NICNAME
database and server, defined in RFC 954, providing online look-up of
individuals, network organizations, key nodes, and other information
of interest to those who use the Internet.  Other distributed
directory information servers and information retrieval tools have
been developed and it is anticipated more will be created.  Many
sites now maintain local directory servers with information about
individuals, departments and services at that specific site.
Typically these directory servers are network accessible.  Because
these servers are local, there are now wide variations in the type of
data stored, access methods, search schemes, and user interfaces.
The purpose of the Whois and Network Information Lookup Service
(WNILS) working group is to expand and define the standard for WHOIS
services, to resolve issues associated with the variations in access
and to promote a consistent and predictable service across the
network.
<p>

Goals and Milestones:
<p>

Done    Review and approve the charter making any changes deemed
necessary. Examine the particular functional needs for
expanded whois directory service. Begin work on a framework
for recommendations.  Assign writing assignments for first
draft of document.
<p>

12/1/93 Submit the Whois and Network Information Lookup Service
Recommendations document to the IESG as an Internet Draft.
<p>

12/1/93 Submit the WHOIS++ protocol document to the IESG as an
Internet Draft.
<p>

12/1/93 Submit the "Architecture of the Whois++ Index Service"
document to the IESG as a revised Internet Draft.
<p>

12/1/93 Freeze all work on the Internet Drafts for 6 months for
software development.
<p>

Membership is open to attendees of the quarterly IETF meetings; the
mailing list is open to all.  The WNILS-WG charter can be obtained via

<h4>NIR Group Name: Internet Research Task Force Research Group on Resource 
Discovery and Directory Service (IRTF-RD)</h4></a>
<p>

Sponsoring Organisation: Internet Society
<p>

Working subgroups: None
<p>

Description of main group:
<p>

The IRTF-RD group is focused on problems of scale that will arise in
resource discovery systems in the next 3-5 years.  We divide these
scaling problems into three dimensions: volume of information, size of
the user base, and information diversity.
<p>

Our goal is to explore techniques for dealing with these problems
through a set of interrelated prototypes demonstrating advances in
each of these dimensions.  Briefly, our current approaches are:
<ul>
<li> deal with information diversity through a coordinated set
of techniques to gather, transform, and manage entropy of data
<li> deal with user scale through large scale replication
<li> deal with information volume using a combination of
views, space efficient indexing, and customization w.r.t.
vocabulary, search methods, and personal user history
We expect these approaches to evolve significantly over time.
<p>

Membership of this group is closed.  We will consider new members,
with two constraints.  First, the group must be kept small and focused
to make substantive progress - at most 4 or 5 members seems
appropriate at this time.  Second, prospective members must be active
resource discovery researchers, who will bring clear strengths to the
group.  Prospective members should send a vitae and a one page
position paper describing what they propose to do to advance the
group's efforts, addressed to the group chair.
<p>

The group currently consists of:
Mic Bowman (Transarc, Inc.)
Peter Danzig (University of Southern California)
Udi Manber (University of Arizona)
Mike Schwartz (University of Colorado - Boulder; chair)

<dt>Description of main group:
<dd>The Z39.50 Implementors group (ZIG) is a volunteer organization
consisting of representatives of most of the organizations in the
United States and Canada that are actively engaged in implementing
the Z39.50 protocol.  This includes the United States Library of
Congress, The National Library of Canada, the major bibliographic
utilities, many library automation vendors, and other information
service providers.  The group is a volunteer effort whose meetings
are open at no charge to all.  The group meets about 3 times a year
and conducts its activities extensively on its mailing list which is
also open to any interested party.
<p>

The group was originally formed to deal with interoperability issues
among the Z39.50 implementations that were beginning to emerge in
1989 and 1990 but the group has since expanded its role and has now
become the primary forum in which new features and versions of the
Z39.50 are developed.

Brief Description of the Z39.50 Protocol
<p>

Z39.50 is a US ANSI standard protocol for information retrieval.  It
uses a client server model that allows clients ( or origins in Z39.50
terminology) to search servers (targets in Z39.50 usage) and retrieve
records from remote databases.  The type and format of the data
retrieved is not constrained by the protocol but is agreed to by the
origin and the target.  There is a mechanism that allows popular
record syntax's to be registered and then referred to by well known
identifiers.  Z39.50 is an OSI application layer protocol; that is,
it is designed to make use of the OSI presentation layer protocol.
It may be used with or without the presentation protocol, and below
that, it is irrelevant (to the Z39.50 protocol) what protocols are
used.  Most implementations of Z39.50 currently run directly over
TCP/IP.
<p>

User's View:
<p>

Users (either human or electronic) run client software to connect
with servers to retrieve information using the Z39.50 protocol.  Many
clients already exist at least in prototype version today and more
are being written.  Most of the major library automation vendors have
announced that they will be supporting Z39.50 in either client or
server mode or both.  Many of the major information vendors either
currently have or are working on implementations of Z39.50 for their
systems.  There are also a couple of Z39.50 implementations that are
expected to be put in the public domain at some point.  The recently
announced FREEWAIS software incorporates Z39.50 Version 2 into it
(the older version used a variant of the 1988 version 1 protocol).
The Library of Congress acts as the maintenance agency for Z39.50 and
can be contacted for a list of registered Implementors.
<p>

Z39.50 provides a protocol mechanism for accessing remote information
sources.  It defines the model for the interaction between two sides,
a client and a server.  It makes no assumptions or presumptions about
how the data is actually organized in the server, nor about how the
data is presented to the end user by the client.
<p>

The model postulates one or more databases on the remote system that
can be searched using attributes from defined search attribute sets,
creating a result set.  Records can be retrieved from the result set
using agreed upon record formats.
<p>

Information types supported:
<p>

The Z39.50 protocol was designed as a general purpose search and
retrieval mechanism that could be used with a wide variety of data
types.  The MARC format (a format used for cataloging library
material among other things) and a search attribute set suitable for
bibliographic and similar types of data are registered within the
current version of the standard.  It is assumed that, as the protocol
begins to be used by other communities and for other types of data,
other attribute sets and record syntaxes will be developed.  This
process has already begun and a generic record syntax and attribute
set are already under development, as well as some others,
specifically those supporting chemical structures, general science
and technology, and business information.  The design philosophy
behind Z39.50 is that it will be used with other standards such as
Postscript, SGML, ODIF (and others), to communicate a wide variety of
data types, including full text, images, and many others.

been established by the RARE Technical Committee as one of the major
working groups in the RARE Technical Programme.  ISUS is concerned
with all aspects of networked information services, group
communications and network user support.  It is open to all those
involved in working in these areas and should include:
<p>

Network User Support Staff: National and European Support Staff
(whether RARE, RIPE, EARN, Eunet etc.)
Site Computing Centre Support Staff
Special subject related User Support Staff
<p>

Library Staff
Networked Information Providers
Networked Information Service Providers
Application Developers
<p>

The ISUS WG mailing list will act both as a forum for discussion
amongst experts in this field and as a means for disseminating
information to the wider community.
<p>

The ISUS Working Group is chartered to have a very broad area of
interest which is broken down into several sub-areas:
Network User Support
Asynchronous Group Communication
Networked Information Retrieval and Services
Liaison
<p>

Current tasks being worked on in the area of NIR include:
<p>

o    Coordination of NIR services in Europe
<p>

o    Collection of information related to NIR tools and groups.
This is a joint effort with the IETF and CNI.
<p>

o    Network Interface to everything (UNITE).  This group is starting
to look at the user requirements for a single interface to the
network (network information services, email, bulletin boards,
etc.).   (unite@mailbase.ac.uk)
<p>

o    Multimedia Information Services task force (MMIS).  This group is
a joint task force of the RARE ISUS Working Group and RARE
Interactive Multimedia Working Group (mmis@mailbase.ac.uk).

This group was formed in May 1992 and takes over and expands on the
work of the former RARE WG3 USIS Subgroup. The group conducts most
of its business by email, but meets twice a year before the European
Networking Conferences.
<p>

The EARNinfo group has recently joined forces with RARE ISUS WG, they
will be working together in the areas of documentation and network
training.

<b>USMARC/OCLC</b>

Date template updated or checked:  10 March 1994

<p>

Working Group or Organisation:  USMARC/OCLC
<p>

Name of group: USMARC Advisory Group; OCLC Internet Resources
Cataloging Experiment
<p>

Sponsoring Organisations: OCLC, Library of Congress,
USMARC Advisory Group
<p>

Working subgroups:  None
<p>

Description of main group:
<p>

OCLC and the Library of Congress have formed a working group to
consider how libraries can create cataloging records for online
information resources.  The group initiated a cataloging experiment
designed to test and verify the applicability of the cataloging rules
and the USMARC format for computer files.  Guidelines have been
written for cataloging Internet resources and were considered by the
American Library Association committee responsible for maintaining the
Anglo- American Cataloging Rules.  Changes to the USMARC format were
initiated to accommodate a subset of these materials (electronic data
resources, such as software, electronic text, bibliographic and
nonbibliographic databases).  USMARC format changes which were
approved included an identification of type of file and a field for
location and access of the resource (very much like a URL).
<p>

The group is continuing its work by looking at how online systems and
services can be accommodated in USMARC.  This work will be done within
the USMARC Advisory Group of the American Library Association, which
considers changes to the USMARC formats.  Data elements will be
defined with mapping to MARC fields; in some cases new fields will be
proposed.  This will be accomplished in conjunction with efforts by
other working groups (e.g., Government Information Locator Service, or
GILS).
<p>

A proposal was presented and approved in February 1994 to the USMARC
Advisory Group to add data elements to the Electronic Location and
Access Field (USMARC field 856).  Included among these was a subfield
for URL (Uniform Resource Locator).  It is intended to be used instead
of or in addition to other data identifying location of and access to
a networked information resource.
<p>

Membership is closed at this point.

<h3>9.  Acknowledgements</h3></a>
<p>

The report was very much a collaborative effort of the members of the
NIR WG and in particular Peter Deutsch (who contributed the mailing
list section and the basis for Section 5), April Marine, Rick
Rodgers, Lars-Gunnar Olsson, Farhad Anklesaria, Marsha Perrott, Kevin
Gamiel, George Brett, Barbara Thomas and all those who helped review
the document.  Special thanks are due to all those contributors who
took the time to submit and update descriptions of their NIR tools
and groups; their names are included in the templates in Sections 6
and 7.
<p>

Before final submission of the report as an RFC, independent
reviewers from around the world took two or three templates each and
checked them out for accuracy and currency as best they could.  They
liaised with the original template authors over the changes they
made.  The volunteers were: Larry Masinter, Marilyn Martin, Sinha
Velu, Ton Verschuren, Shirley Browne, Alfred Vella, Bert Stals,
Yannis Corovesis, Gerard Egan, Robert Janz and Andy Linton.  They
provided some very valuable input.

NIR Tool Name: Hyper-G
<p>

<dl>
<dt>Brief Description of Tool:
<dd>Hyper-G is the name of an ambitious hypermedia project currently being
developed as a joint effort by a number of institutes of the IIG
(Institutes for Information-Processing Graz) and the Computing and
Information Services Center of the Graz University of Technology and
the Austrian Computer Society.
<p>

Hyper-G is designed as a general-purpose, large-scale, multi-user,
distributed hypermedia information system.  As such, it combines
concepts of hypermedia, information retrieval systems, documentation
systems with aspects of communication and collaboration, and computer
supported teaching and learning.  It also provides seamless
integration of other systems (e.g., World-Wide Web, Gopher, WAIS) that
also operate under the client/server paradigm and allows remote logins
to interactive services.
<p>

In addition to hypertext links, Hyper-G allows navigation through
hierarchies, queries (including full text), guided tours, and is
multilingual.
<p>

Hyper-G is currently operated at some 10 locations throughout the
world, including a University Information System at the Graz Technical
University.  Clients and the server are available without fee for
educational institutions, and are distributed as binaries for a number
of platforms.

NIR Tool Name:    SoftPages
<p>

<dl>
<dt>Brief Description of Tool:
<dd>A tool to aid users in the efficient retrieval of documents, s/w, and
the like from servers ( anonymous FTP, FTAM, ..  ) connected to the
network.  In principle, it uses the X.500 Directory framework to store
information about the network.  This includes the network
configuration, the properties of the links that connect the network
elements, location of servers and their contents.  When a user looks
for a particular document or s/w the above information is used to
search for the object starting from the server that is
"nearest" (cheapest) to the user.
<p>

The X.500 directory services is used in several stages
<br>get list of file-servers
<br>get path to file servers
<br>get attributes for computing cost of paths
<br>search for file that is being sought
<p>

However, under present circumstances, due to lack of deployment of
network information in the directory, when information is unavailable
from X.500, alternate sources/methods are used.  [Static-lists of
file-servers, or lists of file servers from other clients (e.g.,
archie); Paths and/or costs are obtained from static lists or derived
by other direct means (e.g., ping, traceroute); file information is
sought from other servers (e.g., archie).]
<p>

<dt>User's View:
<dd>A "single window" view of the public archives connected to the
network.  It locates the server that contains the sought object and is
near(/cheap/fast) server.
<p>

Query of files based on incomplete name is supported.  The system also
supports queries based on keywords.
<p>

<dt>Information Provider's View:
<dd>The information about the server contents have to be updated
at a single place- namely, the local Directory Service Agent.
The Directory Service Agent makes the information globally
accessible.
It is not necessary to carry out periodic updates on one or
more information servers.
<p>
<ul>
<li> information types supported (e.g., text, sound, etc.)
</ul>
<p>

Since the system supports query on name and keywords (not on
contents) all kinds of information may be supported.

NIR Tool Name: whois++ and the whois++ index service
<p>

<dl>
<dt>Brief Description of Tool:
<dd>whois++ and the whois++ index service are extensions of the WHOIS
protocol.  They are designed to a) subsume in a standardized fashion
the many enhancements which have been added to individual WHOIS
servers; b) extend the flexibility of WHOIS by enriching the query
syntax, and c) provide a distributed indexing system to tie the
various whois++ servers into a distributed information lookup service.
<p>

The protocols describe two logically distinct types of servers that an
information provider can set up.  The first type is the base-level
whois++ server.  This contains primary information, such as entries
for individual people or entries describing resources available
locally.  For example, if one wished to provide a campus directory
through whois++, one would set up a base-level whois++ server that
contained entries for each student.  In addition, this base-level
server must be able to generate 'forward knowledge' for the
information it contains.  The second type of server collects the
'forward knowledge' generated by a number of base-level servers, and
can take a query sent to it and determine which of the base-level
servers it indexes might contain information relevant for the query.
A single physical server may contain both primary information and
'forward knowledge' for a number of other servers, and an index server
can also index 'forward knowledge' for a number of other index
servers, allowing a hierarchical mesh of index servers to be built.
For more details on the information provider's point of view, see the
'Documentation' section of this template.
<p>

The basic information model is centered on the concept of 'templates'.
A template is a collection of attribute:value pairs, where the
allowable attributes are specified by the template type.  The whois++
templates are based on the templates defined by the IAFA working group
of the IETF.  The values associated with given attributes are not
necessarily limited to text, they can be digitized sound clips, etc.
<p>

Depending on the client she uses, the user will see a connection to
the local whois++ base-level server.  The user can ask the server for
a list of templates supported by that server, and can then call up a
blank version of the template so that she can fill in values for the
attributes she knows.  Once she has filled in the template as much as
she wants, she issues a query to the server to find all the entries
which have these attribute:value pairs.  If she is not satisfied with
the responses, she can then start traversing the index service to
locate a server which can adequately answer her query.  In addition,
if a user makes frequent use of the index service, she can set
'bookmarks' which can be used later to directly contact servers she's
found useful in the past, without having to traverse the index service
again.

<p>

Description of main group:
<p>

Program priorities are 1) to facilitate a consistent and complete
mechanism for linking bibliographic, abstracting, and indexing files
to files of their associated source materials; 2) a single standard
for the transmission of bitmapped image files; 3) protocols for
handing networked requests for delivery of source materials; 4)
mechanisms for interorganizational authentication, accounting, and
billing; and 5) to integrate lessons drawn from the experience of
pilot projects that exercise networked printing utilities and 6) to
provide an "interoperability workshop" to specify, implement, and test
advanced functions of Z39.50 to accelerate the pace and to ensure the
quality of standardization efforts in this area.
