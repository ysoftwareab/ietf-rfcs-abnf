<h3>1. Introduction</h3></a>
<p>

As the worldwide academic computer network grows and expands far
beyond its previous confines, so the resources and services available
on the network evolve and multiply at a dizzying rate. The typical
user is hardpressed to keep up with this explosive growth.
Fortunately, a number of tools are available to facilitate the task
of locating and retrieving network resources, so that users anywhere
can utilize texts, data, software and information for public access.
Facilities to explore public domain software repositories, to consult
mailing list archives and databases, to retrieve directory
information and to participate in global group discussions are now
available to all.
<p>

The key to exploiting these resources is a server, special software
on a computer somewhere in the network which accepts requests (or
queries or commands) and sends a response automatically. The
requestor does not have to be working on the same computer (or even
in the same part of the world) in order to use the server. Many
servers accept requests via electronic mail, so that often the
requestor needs not even be on the same computer network as the
server. In many cases, servers are interconnected so that once you
have established contact with one server, you can easily communicate
with other servers as well.
<p>

Today, many users have powerful computers on the desktop, with
advanced graphical, audio and storage capabilities, which are
connected to the network. This fact has given rise to what is known
as the client-server model. Users can have special software on their
local computer called a client which can utilize the capabilities of
that computer and can also communicate with a server on the network.
These clients provide an easy-to-use, intuitive user interface, allow
use of pointing devices such as a mouse, and exploit other local
features. The client sends the user's requests to a server using a
standardized format (called a protocol) and the server sends its
response in a condensed format which the client displays to the user
in a more readable way.
<p>

Several of the tools described herein have several different
functions.  However they could be classified in functional areas
according to their main purpose. Sections two and three cover two
services, Gopher and World-Wide Web, which use the client-server
model to explore the network providing a means of moving through a
wide range of network sources and resources in a uniform and
intuitive way.  A tool for searching in a wide range of different
databases located throughout the network, WAIS, is documented in
section four. The problem of knowing where to find network resources
(files and programs) is addressed in section five, which deals with
archie. Three tools for finding people, computers and their network
addresses, WHOIS, X.500 and Netfind, are discussed in sections six,
seven and eight. While just about all of these network tools can be
used to get files of one sort or another, there are a few servers
available for getting files easily and efficiently from various
repositories in the network. Two of these servers, TRICKLE and
BITFTP, are covered in sections nine and ten. Sections eleven and
twelve deal with what is perhaps the most popular of all the network
resources, discussion groups on every imaginable topic. The two tools
discussed there are LISTSERV and Netnews (Usenet). Section thirteen
gives brief descriptions and pointers for a number of tools which
were not mainstream enough to get a full description. Some are still
in the developmental stage (Prospero), some are relatively unknown
outside a particular network (ASTRA and Netserv from EARN/Bitnet and
Mailbase from JANET) and some are meant for chatting rather than work
(Relay and IRC).
<p>

The purpose of this guide is to supply the basic information that
anyone on the network needs to try out and begin using these tools. A
basic knowledge of networking terminology has been assumed, as well
as familiarity with the basic tools of networking: electronic mail
(often referred to as e-mail or simply mail throughout this guide)
and, for those connected to the Internet, FTP (file transfer
protocol) and Telnet (remote login). It is beyond the scope of this
guide to describe these basic tools. The example in the BITFTP
section of this guide shows how one can use BITFTP to get guides to
these tools over the network.

<h3>2. GOPHER</h3></a>
<p>

<a name="gopher1">
<h4>2.1. What is Gopher</h4></a>
<p>

The Internet Gopher, or simply Gopher, is a distributed document
delivery service. It allows users to explore, search and retrieve
information residing on different locations in a seamless fashion.
<p>

When browsing it, the information appears to the user as a series of
nested menus. This kind of menu structure resembles the organization
of a directory with many subdirectories and files. The subdirectories
and the files may be located either on the local server site or on
remote sites served by other Gopher servers. From the user point of
view, all information items presented on the menus appear to come
from the same place.
<p>

The information can be a text or binary file, directory information
(loosely called phone book), image or sound. In addition, Gopher
offers gateways to other information systems (World-Wide Web, WAIS,
archie, WHOIS) and network services (Telnet, FTP). Gopher is often a
more convenient way to navigate in a FTP directory and to download
files.
<p>

A Gopher server holds the information and handles the users' queries.
In addition, links to other Gopher servers create a network wide
cooperation to form the global Gopher web (Gopherspace).
<p>

<a name="gopher2">
<h4>2.2. Who can use Gopher</h4></a>
<p>

Gopher uses the client-server model to provide access to the Gopher
web.  You must be on the international TCP/IP network (the Internet)
in order to use a client on your computer to access Gopher.
<p>

<a name="gopher3">
<h4>2.3. How to get to Gopher</h4></a>
<p>

Users explore the Gopher menus  using various local clients or
accessing a remote client via an interactive Telnet session.
<p>

<a name="gopher31">
<h4>2.3.1. Local clients</h4></a>

Public domain clients for accessing a Gopher server are available
for: Macintosh, MS-DOS, OS/2, VM/CMS, VMS, NeXT, Unix, X-Windows.
The clients are available for anonymous FTP from many FTP sites
(e.g., boombox.micro.umn.edu in the directory /pub/gopher). See
the list of freely available client software in Appendix A.

<h4>2.3.2. Remote clients</h4></a>
<p>

Some sites allow public access to a client. To access such a
remote client, telnet to one of these sites:
<pre>
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|  info.anu.edu.au                 Australia (login: info)      |

At the login: prompt type gopher (unless specified otherwise) and
the top-level Gopher menu for that site will be displayed.
<p>

Users are requested to use the site closest to them.

<h4>2.4. Using Gopher</h4></a>
<p>

The implementations of the Gopher clients on various platforms are
slightly different to take advantage of the platforms'
capabilities (mouse, graphic functions, X-Windows server) and to
offer the popular look and feel. Even with different
implementations, the same set of functions and commands is
available.
<p>

When issuing the gopher command, you will be connected
automatically to the default Gopher server specified at the
installation. The format of the command is:
<pre>
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                               |
|  gopher     &lt hostname &gt                                     |
|                                                               |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
</pre>
where hostname is an optional alternative Gopher server you want
to talk to.
<p>

When connected to a Gopher server, it is still possible to access
another server by exploring the Other Gopher servers in the rest
of the world branch. To locate them more easily, the Gopher
servers are distributed in geographical regions:
<p>

<br>* Africa
<br>* Europe
<br>* Middle East
<br>* North America
<br>* Pacific
<br>* South America
<p>

and then by countries.
<p>

Access to a Gopher server is identical whether using a local or a
remote client: a simple menu-driven interface which doesn't
require any special training or knowledge from the user.
<p>

Here is a sample menu:
<p>

-----------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>
In the example above, any item can be selected by typing its line number 
or by moving the cursor (-- &gt ) next to it.
<p>

An item could be:
<p>

<br>* a subdirectory
<br>* a text file
<br>* a binary file
<br>* a sound file
<br>* an image file
<br>* a phone book (directory information)
<br>* an index-search
<br>* a Telnet session
<p>

Items are displayed with an identifying symbol next to them. In
the example above, " &lt ? &gt " means a full text index-search, "/" means
a subdirectory, " &lt Picture &gt " means an image file and no symbol
means a text file.
<p>

Some Gopher clients are not able to handle certain file types
(e.g., sound files). Some clients display only files of types they
can handle or files they suppose you are interested in. Others
display all types of files.
<p>

Most Gopher clients allow you to create, view and select
bookmarks. A bookmark keeps track of the exact location of a
Gopher item, regardless of where it resides. It is useful when you
often need to reach a file or a service located far from the
top-level directory. A collection of bookmarks is like a
customized Gopher menu.
<p>

Some capabilities of a local Gopher client are bound to the
capabilities of your own computer. In fact, for sound files, image
files and Telnet sessions, the Gopher client looks for the
appropriate software on your computer and passes control to it to
perform the requested task. When the task is completed, control is
returned to the Gopher client.
<p>

At any time, it is possible to terminate the session (quit
command), to cancel the current processing or to get the on-line
help (help command).
<p>

An item is processed according to its type:
<p>

<dl>
<dt>a subdirectory
<dd>its contents are displayed. To go up one level, use the up
command.
<p>

<dt>a text file
<dd>the file is displayed. Then you can browse it, search for a
particular string, print it on a local printer or copy (save)
it onto your local disk space in a user-specified file (the
last 2 functions may not be available to you).
<p>

<dt>a binary file
<dd>the remote file is simply copied onto your local disk space in
a user-specified file. Binary files are binhexed Macintosh
files, archives (.zip, .tar,...), compressed files, programs,
etc.
<p>

<dt>a sound file
<dd>the remote file is played through your local audio device if it
exists, as well as the appropriate utility. Only one sound file
can be active at a time; you will be warned if you try to play
a sound before a previous one is done.
<p>

<dt>an image file
<dd>the remote file is displayed on your computer screen if an
image viewer exists on your computer.
<p>

<dt>a phone book
<dd>you are prompted for a search string to look up people
information through the selected phone book. Since different
institutions have different directory services, the queries are
not performed in the same fashion.
<p>

<dt>an index-search
<dd>you are prompted for a search string which may be one or more
words, plus the special operators and, or, and not. The search
is case-insensitive. Usually, an index is created to help users
locate the information in a set of documents quickly. E.g.:
<p>

<dt>terminal and setting or tset
<dd>will find all documents which contain both the words terminal
and setting, or the word tset. or is nonexclusive so the
documents may contain all of the words.
<p>

The result of the index-search looks like any Gopher menu, but
each menu item is a file that contains the specified search
string.
<p>

<dt>a Telnet session
<dd>Telnet sessions are normally text-based information services,
for example, access to library catalogs.
<p>

<a name="veronica">
<h4>2.5. VERONICA</h4></a>
<p>

Veronica was designed as a solution to the problem of resource
discovery in the rapidly-expanding Gopher web, providing a keyword
search of more than 500 Gopher menus. Veronica helps you find
Gopher-based information without doing a menu-by-menu, site-by-site
search. It is to the Gopher information space, what archie is to the
FTP archives.
<p>

Veronica is accessible from most top-level Gopher menus or from the
Other Gopher servers... branch. There is no need for opening another
connection or another application.
<p>

When you choose a veronica search , you will be prompted to enter a
keyword or keywords. The simplest way to search with veronica is to
enter a single word and hit the RETURN key. It does not matter
whether the word is upper-case or lower-case. The veronica server
will return a gopher menu composed of items whose titles match your
keyword specification. Items can be accessed as with any Gopher menu.
E.g.:
<p>

eudora
will give you a list of menu titles that contain eudora, such as:
<p>
<pre>
Electronic Mail: Eudora on Macintosh, Micro-08
Modem Setting Eudora Slip.
A UNIX-based Eudora reader for those that ...
Eudora:  Popmail for the Macintosh.
Eudora.
</pre><p>

etc.
<p>

The search string may contain keywords optionally separated by and,
or and not. If there is no operator between 2 keywords, and is
assumed. E.g.:
<p>

eudora and macintosh
<p>

will give you a list of menu titles that contain both eudora and
macintosh, such as:
<p>
<pre>
Eudora:  Popmail for the Macintosh.
v4.1 EUDORA: E-MAIL FOR THE MACINTOSH.
Micro News:  Eudora - A Mailer for the Macintosh.
Eudora: Electronic Mail on Your Macintosh.
ACS News - Eudora Mail Reader for Macintosh.
</pre><p>

etc.
<p>

"*" is the wildcard character. It can replace any other character or
characters at the end of a keyword. E.g.:
<p>

desk*
<p>

will give you a list of menu titles, such as:
<p>
<pre>
The Help Desk.
Keene State College Press Release COMPUTER ON EVERY DESK.
DESKQview/X... An alternative to Windows???.

<h3>3. WORLD-WIDE WEB</h3></a>
<p>

<a name="www1">
<h4>3.1. What is World-Wide Web</h4></a>
<p>

World-Wide Web (also called WWW or W3) is an information system based
on hypertext, which offers a means of moving from document to
document (usually called to navigate) within a network of
information.
<p>

Hypertext documents are linked to each other through a selected set
of words. For example, when a new word, or a new concept, is
introduced in a text, hypertext makes it possible to point to another
document which gives more details about it. The reader can open the
second document by selecting the unknown word or concept and the
relevant section is displayed. The second document may also contain
links to further details. The reader need not know where the
referenced document is, and there is no need to type a command to
display it, or to browse it to find the right paragraph.
Cross-references may be defined in the same document. A collection of
documents is a database.
<p>

If you were reading this document on a hypertext system, instead of
this all too short explanation about hypertext, you would have a
selectable pointer to a complete hypertext information web with
examples and more pointers to other definitions.
<p>

For instance, in the first document you might read:
<p>

<hr>
<p>

The  WorldWideWeb (W3)  is a  wide-area <a href="#hypermedia">"hypermedia"</a>  information
retrieval initiative aiming  to give universal access  to a large
universe of documents.
<p>

<hr>
<p>

Selecting hypermedia will display the following explanation for you:
<p>

<hr>
<p>

<a name="hypermedia">
<b>WHAT IS HYPERTEXT</b></a>
<p>
Hypertext is text which is not constrained to be linear.
<p>

Hypertext is text which contains "links" to other texts. The term
was coined by "Ted Nelson" around 1965 (see "History").
<p>

HyperMedia is a term used  for hypertext which is not constrained
to  be text:  it can  include  graphics, video  and "sound",  for
example. Apparently Ted Nelson was the first to use this term too.
<p>

<hr>
<p>

Then you can learn more about links and Nelson. Indeed, the links in
WWW are not confined to text only, so the term hypermedia is more
accurate.  For example, the link to Nelson might point to a file
containing a picture of Ted Nelson. The picture would be displayed on
your screen if you have a suitable configuration.
<p>

Also, special documents (indexes) in the WWW information space can be
search for given keyword(s). The result is a document which contains
links to the documents found.
<p>

World-Wide Web uses hypertext over the network: the linked documents
may be located at various sites. WWW can handle different text
formats and various information organizations. WWW also provides
access to many of the other tools described in this guide.
<p>

<a name="www2">
<h4>3.2. Who can use World-Wide Web</h4></a>
<p>

WWW uses the client-server model to provide access to the information
universe. You must be on the international TCP/IP network (the
Internet) in order to use a client on your computer to access WWW. If
you are on the Internet, but don't have a WWW client on your
computer, you can still enter the World-Wide Web. Several sites offer
public interactive access to WWW clients (see the Remote clients
section under How to get to World-Wide Web below).
<p>

If you have e-mail access only, or if you are not on the Internet
then you can not fully exploit the vast potential of WWW. However, a
mail-robot is available at the address: listserv@info.cern.ch which
gives e-mail access to WWW-accessible listserv@info.cern.ch files.
(see E-mail access section under How to get to World-Wide Web below).
<p>
<a name="www3">
<h4>3.3. How to get to World-Wide Web</h4></a>
<p>

Users access the World-Wide Web facilities via a client called a
browser. This interface provides transparent access to the WWW
servers.  If a local WWW client is not available on your computer,
you may use a client at a remote site. Thus, an easy way to start
with WWW is to access a remote client.
<p>

<a name="www31">
<h5>3.3.1. Local clients</h5></a>
<p>

Usage of a local client is encouraged since it provides better
performance and better response time than a remote client.
<p>

Public domain clients for accessing WWW servers are available for:
Macintosh, MS-DOS, VMS, VM/CMS, MVS, NeXT, Unix, X-Windows. The
clients are available for anonymous FTP from info.cern.ch in the
directory /pub/www. All these platforms support a simple line mode
browser. In addition, graphical clients are available for:
Macintosh, Windows, X-Windows, NeXT and Unix. See the list of
freely available client software in Appendix A.
<p>

<a name="www32">
<h5>3.3.2. Remote clients</h5></a>
<p>

To access a remote WWW client, telnet to the client site. If you
are new to WWW, you should telnet to info.cern.ch. No login is
needed. You will immediately enter the WWW line mode browser. Some
publicly accessible clients feature locally developed clients.
Most remote clients are at sites with WWW servers with information
on specific areas. After you telnet to the client site, at the
login: prompt enter www, no password is needed. The following
remote client sites are available:

<a name="www321">
<h6>3.3.2.1. E-mail access</h6></a>
<p>

In order to get a file, send mail to listserv@info.cern.ch with
a SEND command. The SEND command returns the document with the
given WWW address, subject to certain restrictions. Hypertext
documents are formatted to 72 character width, with links
numbered. A separate list at the end of the file gives the
document-addresses of the related documents.
<p>

If the document is hypertext, its links will be marked by
numbers in brackets, and a list of document addresses by number
will be appended to the message. In this way, you can navigate
through the web, more or less. A good file to start with would
be:<a href="http://info.cern.ch./hypertext/DataSources/bySubject/Overview.html">
<br>http://info.cern.ch./hypertext/DataSources/bySubject/Overview.html</a>
<p>

Note that, despite the name listserv in the address of this
mail robot, it is not a LISTSERV server.
<p>

A note of caution from the WWW developers and maintainers:
<p>

"As the robot gives potential mail access to a *vast* amount of
information, we must emphasise that the service should not be
abused.  Examples of appropriate use would be:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Accessing any information about W3 itself;
<li> Accessing any CERN and/or physics-related or network development related information;
</ul>
<p>

Examples of INappropriate use would be:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Attempting to retrieve binaries or tar files or anything more
than directory listings or short ASCII files from FTP archive
sites;
<li> Reading Usenet newsgroups which your site doesn't receive;
<li> Repeated automatic use.
</ul>
<p>

There is currently a 1000 line limit on any returned file. We
don't want to overload other people's mail relays or our
server. We reserve the right to withdraw the service at any
time. We are currently monitoring all use of the server, so
your reading will not initially enjoy privacy.
<p>

Enjoy!"

When using a graphical interface, you access the WWW functions by
pressing mouse buttons. In particular, references are highlighted or
underlined words. To follow a link, click on the associated
reference.
<p>

The line mode browser is a more simple user interface: references are
numbers in square brackets next to words. Type the number and hit the

   Go docaddress
      goes to the document represented by the given hypertext address,
      which is interpreted relatively to the current document.
<p>

   Extra command available on Unix versions only:
<p>

   Print
      prints the current document, without the numbered document

   To access WWW with the line mode browser, type: www. The default
   first document will appear on your screen. From this point, you
   should be able to navigate through the WWW universe by reading the
   text and following the instructions at the bottom of the screen. If
   you want to start with a first document other than the default, or if
   you want to change some other aspect of the usual interaction, there
   are a number of command line parameters and options available. The

      adds a list of the addresses of all documents references to the
      end.  Non-interactive mode only.
<p>

   -pn
      sets the page length to n lines. Without a number, makes the page
      length infinite. Default is 24.
<p>

   -wn
      sets the page width to n columns. The default is 78, 79 or 80
      depending on the system.
<p>

   -na

<h3>4. WAIS</h3></a>
<p>

<a name="wais1">
<h4>4.1. What is WAIS</h4></a>
<p>

WAIS, Wide Area Information Server,  is a distributed information
retrieval system. It helps users search databases over networks using
an easy-to-use interface. The databases (called sources) are mostly
collections of text-based documents, but they may also contain sound,
pictures or video as well. Databases on topics ranging from
Agriculture to Social Science can be searched with WAIS.
<p>

The databases may be organized in different ways, using various
database systems, but the user isn't required to learn the query
languages of the different databases. WAIS uses natural language
queries to find relevant documents. The result of the query is a set
of documents which contain the words of the query: no semantic
information is extracted from the query.
<p>

<a name="wais2">
<h4>4.2. Who can use WAIS</h4></a>
<p>

WAIS uses the client-server model to provide access to databases. You
must be on the international TCP/IP network (the Internet) in order
to use a client on your computer to access WAIS.
<p>

If you have e-mail access only, or if you are not on the Internet you
can still exploit some of the potential of WAIS. An e-mail interface
is available at the address: waismail@quake.think.com which gives
e-mail access to WAIS databases (see E-mail access section under
Using WAIS below).
<p>

<a name="wais3">
<h4>4.3. How to get to WAIS</h4></a>
<p>

There are many WAIS servers throughout the network. A
directory-of-servers database is available at several sites. You can
address a query to it, e.g., to find out what databases are available
on a particular subject. This database is also available via
anonymous FTP from Think.com in the directory /wais as file
wais-sources.tar.Z.
<p>

If you do not have access to a WAIS client, (at least) two
demonstration sites are available to allow you to get acquainted with
WAIS. You can telnet to:
<p><pre>
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                               |
|  quake.think.com   (login: wais)                              |
|  sunsite.unc.edu   (login: swais)                             |
|                                                               |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
</pre><p>
The two demonstration sites above run swais (Screen WAIS), a simple
WAIS client for Unix.
<p>

<a name="wais4">
<h4>4.4. Using WAIS</h4></a>
<p>

There are many freely available client software programs for various
operating systems (Unix, VMS, MVS, MS-DOS, OS/2 and Macintosh) and
for specific environments (GNU Emacs, X-Windows, Openlook, Sunview,
NeXT, and MS-Windows). See the list of freely available client
software in Appendix A.
<p>

The client interface differs slightly on different platforms.
However, the queries are performed in the same way, whatever the
interface.
<p>
<ul>
<li> Step 1: The user selects a set of databases to be searched from
among the available databases.
<p>

<li> Step 2: The user formulates a query by giving keywords to be
searched for.
<p>

<li> Step 3: When the query is run, WAIS asks for information from each
selected database.
<p>

<li> Step 4: Headlines of documents satisfying the query are displayed.
The selected documents contain the requested words and phrases.
Selected documents are ranked according to the number of matches.
<p>

<li> Step 5: To retrieve a document, the user simply selects it from the
resulting list.
<p>

<li> Step 6: If the response is incomplete, the user can state the
question differently or feed back to the system any one or more of
the selected documents he finds relevant.
<p>

<li> Step 7: When the search is run again, the results will be updated
to include documents which are similar to the ones selected,
meaning documents which share a large number of common words.
</ul>
<p>

<a name="wais41">
<h5>4.4.1. E-mail access:</h5></a>
<p>

You can query WAIS databases and retrieve documents by sending
commands in the body part of an e-mail message to
waismail@quake.think.com. The Subject: line is ignored. The important
commands are (a vertical bar (|) indicates a choice of parameters):
<p>
<dl>
<dt>help
<dd>to get the help file
<p>

<dt>maxres number
<dd>to set the maximum number of results to be returned.
<p>
</dl>
<p>
<pre>
search source-name | "source-name1 source-name2 ..." keywords
</pre><p>

where:
<p>
<dl>
<dt>source-name
<dd>is a source name as found in the directory-of-servers (with or
without the .src ending). Use double-quotes (") to group
several sources to be searched.
<p>

<dt>keywords
<dd>are the words you would normally type into a query.
<p>

You may specify several search requests in a mail message. If you
don't know what sources you can search, just try anything. If the
source name is not recognised, you'll get a list of sources.
<p>

<dt>retrieve docid
<dd>to retrieve a document from a database. docid is a DocID as
returned by a search above. You may put more than one retrieval
request in a mail message, but you must leave a blank line between
requests. The docid must be written exactly as returned by a
search request, including any spaces. You can retrieve non-text
documents as well as text. If the document is of type TEXT or WSRC
you will get the result directly. Other types will be UUENCODED.
<p>

<dt>DocID: docid
<dd>same as retrieve. This form is identical to the form which is
returned by a search request. It makes it easy to use the reply
mail function to retrieve results.
</dl><p>

<h4>4.5. Examples</h4></a>
<p>

When you log in to the demonstration site at quake.think.com, you
have immediate access to the directory-of-servers database via the

<h3>5. ARCHIE</h3></a>
<p>

<a name="archie1">
<h4>5.1. What is ARCHIE</h4></a>
<p>

Archie is an information system. It offers an electronic directory
service for locating information in the international TCP/IP network
(the Internet).
<p>

The best known use of archie is for scanning a database of the
contents of more than 1000 anonymous FTP sites around the world.
Currently, this database contains more than 2,100,000 file names from
anonymous FTP sites. This database is known as the archie database.
<p>

The files made available at anonymous FTP sites are software packages
for various systems (Windows, MS-DOS, Macintosh, Unix, etc.),
utilities, information or documentation files, mailing list or Usenet
group discussion archives. At most FTP sites, the resources are
organized hierarchically in directories and subdirectories. The
database tracks both the directory path and the file names.
<p>

The archie database is automatically updated, thereby ensuring that
the information is accurate. Using this database, users can easily
find the the location of files they need without logging onto several
machines.
<p>

<a name="archie2">
<h4>5.2. Who can use ARCHIE</h4></a>
<p>

Users on any network can access the archie database by electronic
mail.  Other means of access are available to users on the Internet
(see the section Using ARCHIE below for details).
<p>

You are requested to respect a few basic rules when you request
information from an archie server:
<p>
<ul>
<li> avoid connecting during working hours; most of the archie
servers are
not dedicated machines, they have local functions as well.
<p>

<li> make your queries as specific as possible; the response will be
quicker and shorter.
<p>

<li> user interfaces installed on your computer contribute to reduce the
load on the server sites, please use them.
<p>

<li> use the archie server closest to you and, in particularly, don't
overload the transatlantic lines.
</ul>
<p>

<a name="archie3">
<h4>5.3. How to get to ARCHIE</h4></a>
<p>

The archie database is maintained in the following locations:

<p>

There are three ways to access the archie database: via a local
client, interactive Telnet session or electronic mail. Each type of
access is described below in the Using ARCHIE section.
<p>

<a name="archie4">
<h4>5.4. Using ARCHIE</h4></a>
<p>

The format of the parameters is given at the end of this section.
Angle brackets ( &lt  &gt ) indicate an optional parameter; a vertical bar
(|) indicates a choice of parameters.
<p>

Note: A new version of the archie server (3.0) is now available. Some
of the commands for interactive access and the e-mail interface are
slightly different from previous versions of the server (2.11 and
before). Command formats marked with a (+) are valid in version 3.0
only, those marked with a (*) are acceptable only in previous
versions.  To find out which version is installed at the server you
wish to use, issue the version command.
<p>

<a name="archie41">
<h5>5.4.1. Using a local client:</h5></a>
<p>

Usage of these clients is encouraged since they provide quick and
easy non-interactive access to the archie servers, and thus,
better performance of the servers and better response time for the
user.
<p>

Public domain clients for accessing archie servers are available
for: Macintosh, MS-DOS, OS/2, VMS, NeXT, Unix and X-Windows. The
clients are available for anonymous FTP from the archie sites in
the directories /pub/archie/clients or /archie/clients. All these
platforms support a simple command line client. In addition, a
graphical interface (called xarchie) is available for X-Windows.
<p>

<a name="archie411">
<h6>5.4.1.1. Archie client command and parameters</h6></a>
<p>

When using a graphical interface, you access the archie functions
by pressing mousse buttons. The results are displayed with
selectable fields for further explorations.
<p>

The basic archie client is a command with parameters that you
enter on your local machine. With most versions of the archie
client, if you type archie with no parameters, you will get a list
of the possible parameters and a short description of each. The
format of the command is:

parameter is not given, then the query will be sent to the
default archie server, if one is defined.
<p>

<dt>L
<dd>lists known servers and current default server.
</dl>
<p>

The following group of options determines the kind of search
performed on the database. They are mutually exclusive.
<p>
<dl>
<dt>s
<dd>a match occurs if the file/directory name contains string. The
search is case insensitive.
<p>

<dt>c
<dd>as above, but the search is case sensitive.
<p>

<dt>e
<dd>string must EXACTLY match (including case) the file/directory
name in the database. This is the DEFAULT search method.
<p>

<dt>r
<dd>searches the database using pattern. It contains special
characters which must be interpreted before performing the
search.
</dl>
<p>

There may be some slight differences in the options available with
different clients on different platforms.
<p>

The result is a list of FTP site addresses with files or
directories matching the argument, the size of the file, its last
modification date and its directory. By default, the list is
sorted by host address. See the Examples section below for an
example of archie output.
<p>

<h5>5.4.2. Using Telnet:</h5></a>
<p>

To access an archie server interactively, telnet to one of the
existing servers (see the list of servers in the section How to
get to ARCHIE above). At the login: prompt enter archie, the login
procedure ends leaving the user at a archie &gt  prompt. The server is
ready for user requests. The following commands are available:
<p>
<dl>
<dt>exit, quit, bye
<dd>exits archie.
<p>

<dt>help   &lt command-name &gt
<dd>invokes the on-line help. If issued with commandname, the help
request is restricted to the specified topic. Pressing the
RETURN key exits from the on-line help.
<p>

<dt>list   &lt pattern &gt
<dd>provides a list of the sites in the database and the time at
which they were last updated. The optional parameter limits the
list to sites matching pattern. The result is a list of site
names, sites IP address and date of the last update in the
database. The command list with no pattern will list all sites
in the database (more than 1000 sites!). E.g.,
<p>

list \.de$
<p>

will list all German sites
<p>

<dt>site(*)  site-name
<dd>lists the directories and, recursively, the subdirectories, of
site-name in the database. The result may be very long.
<p>

<dt>whatis  string
<dd>searches the database of software package descriptions for
string. The search is case-insensitive.
<p>

<dt>prog  string  |  pattern
<dd>find(+)  string  |  pattern
searches the database for string or pattern which represents
the name of the resource to be found in the database. Searches
may be performed in a number of different ways specified in the
variable search (set command) which also decides the
interpretation of the parameter as string or pattern. The
result is a list of FTP site addresses with matching entries,
the size of the resource, its last modification date and the
directory to find it. The number of hits is limited by the
maxhits variable (set command). The result of prog can be
sorted in different ways, depending on the value of the sortby
variable (set command). By default, the variables search,
maxhits and sortby are set to, respectively, exact match search
on string, 1000 hits and unsorted resulting list. Typing the
keyboard interrupt character during a search will abort it. The
results up to that time are displayed. See the Examples section
below for an example of the prog command and its results.
<p>

<dt>mail   &lt email &gt    &lt ,email2... &gt
<dd>sends the result of the last command in a mail message to the
specified e-mail address(es). If issued with no argument, the
result is sent to the address specified in the variable mailto
(set command).
<p>

<dt>show   &lt variable &gt
<dd>displays the value of the given variable name. If issued with
no argument, it displays all variables. See the set command
below for the possible variables.
<p>

<dt>set  variable  value
<dd>sets one of the archie's variables. Values of these variables
affect how archie interacts with the user.
<p>

Variables and values are:
<dl><p>

<dt>compress(+)  compress-method
<dd>specifies the compression method (none or compress) to be used
before mailing a result with the mail command. The default is
none.
<p>

<dt>encode(+)  encode-method
<dd>specifies the encoding method (none or uuencode) to be used
before mailing a result with the mail command. This variable is
ignored if compress is not set. The default is none.
<p>

<dt>mailto  email   &lt ,email2 ... &gt
<dd>specifies the e-mail address(es) to mail the result of the last
command when mail is issued with no arguments.
<p>

<dt>maxhits  number
<dd>specifies the maximum number of matches prog will generate
(within the range 0 to 1000). The default value is 1000.
<p>

<dt>search  search-value
<dd>determines the kind of search performed on the database by the
command: prog string | pattern. search-values are:
<p>

<dt>sub
<dd>a parttial and case insensitive search is performed with
string on the database, e.g.:
<p>

"is" will match "islington" and "this" and "poison"
<p>

<dt>subcase
<dd>as above but the search is case sensitive, e.g.:
<p>

"TeX" will match "LaTeX" but not "Latex"
<p>

<dt>exact
<dd>the parameter of prog (string) must EXACTLY match (including
case) the string in the database. The fastest search method
of all, and the default.
<p>

<dt>regex
<dd>pattern is interpreted before performing a search on the
database.
<p>

<dt>sortby  sort-value
<dd>describes how to sort the result of prog. sort-values are:
<p>

<dt>hostname
<dd>on the FTP site address in lexical order.
<p>

<dt>time
<dd>by the modification date, most recent first.
<p>

<dt>size
<dd>by the size of the found files or directories, largest
first.
<p>

<dt>filename
<dd>on file or directory name in lexical order.
<p>

<dt>none
<dd>unsorted (default)
<p>

The reverse sorting orders from those described here are
obtained by prepending r to the sortby value given. (e.g.,
reverse hostname order hostname is rhostname).
</dl>
<p>

<dt>term  terminal-type    &lt number-of-rows   &lt number-of-columns &gt  &gt
<dd>tells  the archie  server what  type of  terminal  you are

<h5>5.4.3. Using electronic mail:</h5></a>
<p>

Users limited to electronic mail connectivity can access the
archie servers by sending mail to the domain address of one of the
servers listed in the section How to get to ARCHIE (e.g.,
archie@archie.ac.il).  The commands are sent in the body part of
the mail.
<p>

The electronic mail interface to an archie server recognizes a
subset of the commands described in Using Telnet. Most useful
commands and particularities to the e-mail interface are described
below. If an empty message, or a message containing no valid
requests is received, it will be considered to be a help request.
<p>

Command lines begin in the first column. All lines that do not
match a valid command are ignored. The Subject: line is processed
as if it were part of the message body.
<p>
<dl>
<dt>help
<dd>sends you the help file. The help command is exclusive, ie,
other commands in the same message are ignored.
<p>

<dt>path  return-address
<dd>set mailto(+)  return-address
<dd>specifies a return e-mail address different from that which is
extracted from the message header. If you do not receive a
reply from the archie server within several hours, you might
need to add a path command to your message request.
<p>

<dt>list  pattern   &lt pattern2 ... &gt
<dd>provides a list of the sites in the database that match pattern
and the time at which they were last updated. The result is a
list with site names, sites IP address and date of the last
update in the database.
<p>

<dt>site(*)  site-name
<dd>lists the directories and, recursively, the subdirectories, of
site-name in the database.
<p>

<dt>whatis  string   &lt string2 ... &gt
<dd>searches the database of software packages descriptions for
each string.  The search is case insensitive.
<p>

<dt>prog  pattern   &lt pattern2 ... &gt
<dt>find(+)  pattern   &lt pattern2 &gt
<dd>searches the database for each interpretation of pattern which
represents the name of a resource to be found in the database.
If multiple patterns are placed on one line, in that case, the
results will be mailed back in one message. If multiple prog
lines appear, then multiple messages will be returned, one for
each prog line. Results are sorted by FTP site address in
lexical order. If pattern contains spaces, it must be quoted
with single (') or double (") quotes. The search is case
insensitive.
<p>

<dt>compress(*)
<dd>causes the result of the current request to be compressed and
uuencoded. When you receive the reply, you should run it
through uudecode. This will produce a .Z file. You can then run
uncompress on this file and get the result of your request
<p>

<dt>set compress(+)  compress-method
<dd>specifies the compression method (none or compress) to be used
before mailing the result of the current request. The default
is none.
<p>

<dt>set encode(+)  encode-method
<dd>specifies the encoding method (none or uuencode) to be used
before mailing the result of the current request. This variable
is ignored if compress is not set. The default is none.
</dl><p>

Note: set compress compress and set encode uuencode would
produce the same result as the former compress command.
<p>
<dl>
<dt>quit
<dd>nothing past this point is interpreted. Useful when a signature
is automatically appended at the end of your mail messages.
</dl>
<p>

<b>Description of pattern</b>
<p>

A pattern describes a character string including characters which
take a special meaning. The special meaning is lost when "\" is
put before the character. The special characters are:
<p>
<dl>
<dt>.
<dd>(period) this is the wildcard character that replaces any other
character, e.g., "...." will match any 4 character string.
<p>

<dt>^
<dd>(caret) if "^" appears at the beginning of the pattern, then
the searched string must start with the substring following the
"^". If it occurs anywhere else in the pattern it is regarded
as non-special, e.g.:
<p>

"^efghi" will match "efghi" or "efghijlk" but not
"abcefghi"
<p>

<dt>$
<dd>(dollar) if "$" appears at the end of the pattern, then the
searched string must end with the substring preceding the "$".
If occurring anywhere else in the pattern, it is regarded as
non-special, e.g.:
<p>

"efghi$" will match "efghi" or "abcdefghi" but not
"efghijkl"

<h3>6. WHOIS</h3></a>
<p>

<a name="whois1">
<h4>6.1. What is WHOIS</h4></a>
<p>

WHOIS provides directory service to network users. This service is a
way of finding e-mail addresses, postal addresses and telephone
numbers. It may also deliver information about networks, networking
organizations, domains and sites.
<p>

The main database of networking-related names (organizations, sites,
networks, people, etc.) is maintained by the Internet Registration
Service (InterNIC). Actually, the names of the administrative and
technical contacts for registered domains are automatically entered
into the database when domain or IP number applications are processed
by the Internet coordination authority. Each entry of the database
has a handle (a unique identifier), a name, a record type, and
various other fields depending on the type of record. This database
will be used as an example in the descriptions below.
<p>

Before April 1, 1993, the Network Information Center (NIC) of the
Defense Data Network (DDN) was the Internet coordination authority
and, therefore, maintained the database (known as the NIC database).
The NIC database is now restricted to information about the .mil
domain. Many documents still refer to these names.
<p>

Many academic sites maintain their own database to offer information
about their staff members and students.
<p>

In its current implementation, WHOIS has some limitations which
prevent it from becoming an efficient directory service for a large
volume of information and numerous requests: the various WHOIS
servers have no knowledge of each other, a database is maintained at
each server site, and, finally, new functionalities have been
implemented locally at various sites and not propagated. A new
extended protocol, WHOIS++, is being specified to improve the current
service. WHOIS++ will include local enhancements to the WHOIS
service, an improved query syntax and its architecture will allow a
real distributed directory service for the entire Internet.
<p>

This new protocol for directory services will be made available
shortly.
<p>

<a name="whois2">
<h4>6.2. Who can use WHOIS</h4></a>
<p>

WHOIS is available to users on the international TCP/IP network (the
Internet).
<p>

A WHOIS server is accessible across the network from a user program
running on local machines or via an interactive Telnet session to the
site which hosts the server.
<p>

In addition, the InterNIC offers an electronic mail interface to the
database it maintains, allowing users not on the Internet or users
with electronic mail only to access this information. This type of
access is described below in the Using WHOIS section.
<p>

In general, WHOIS servers should only be used for isolated queries
about specific information. Typically, it is not acceptable to make
an extended series of queries to obtain large sections of the
directory.  Such a strategy is unfair both because of excessive
consumption of server resources, and because the directory
information belongs to individuals. In particular, extracting lists
of people for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited.
<p>

<a name="whois3">
<h4>6.3. How to get to WHOIS</h4></a>
<p>

There are many WHOIS servers throughout the network and a
comprehensive list would be too long to be included here. A WHOIS
server offers information about the organization to which it belongs:
it doesn't share a common directory with other WHOIS servers and
doesn't know either where to find information about other
institutions.
<p>

<a name="whois4">
<h4>6.4. Using WHOIS</h4></a>
<p>

WHOIS has become the familiar name of the user program for accessing
a WHOIS database, although NICNAME is the original name.
<p>

In the following, angle brackets ( &lt  &gt ) indicate an optional parameter.
<p>

<a name="whois41">
<h5>6.4.1. Using a local client:</h5></a>
<p>

Unix computers have a native whois command. On non-Unix machines,
ask your system administrator whether your computer has it or not.
This command searches the database on the specified site for entry
which contains identifier. The format is:
<p><pre>
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                               |

+---------------------------------------------------------------+
</pre><p>
<p>

where:
<p>
<dl>
<dt>site-name
<dd>is the domain address of the site which hosts the database you
want to query (e.g., whois.internic.net). On some
installations, the default value is still set to the old NIC
database site (nic.ddn.mil).
<p>

<dt>identifier
<dd>is a name (person, host, domain or network), an IP number or a
handle.
</dl>
<p>

Special characters may be used in identifier to specify the
search:
<p>
<dl>
<dt>.
<dd>before identifier will cause a name-only search.
<p>

<dt>!
<dd>before identifier will cause a handle-only search.
<p>

<dt>... or .
<dd>after identifier will cause a partial search: everything
starting with identifier will match.
<p>

<dt>@
<dd>in identifier will cause a search on the e-mail addresses.
<p>

<dt>*
<dd>before identifier will return the entire membership list of the
entry that matches identifier (e.g., a site and its registered
users).
<p>

<dt>%
<dd>before identifier will return only the membership list of the
entry that matches identifier (e.g., the registered users of a
site).
</dl><p>

The special characters may be used together.
<p>

The results are displayed in one of 2 ways:
<p>
<ul>
<li> a full detailed display for a single match,
<li> a list of summary lines for multiple matches.
</ul><p>

In both cases, the handle is shown in parentheses after the name.

<h5>6.4.2. Using Telnet:</h5></a>
<p>

To access the InterNIC database interactively, telnet to the
InterNIC site (whois.internic.net). No login is required.
<p>

Other WHOIS databases may have a Telnet access and offer most of
the functions below (e.g., whois.ripe.net which hosts the WHOIS

<dt>Q, QUIT, RETURN key
<dd>exits WHOIS
<p>

<dt>&lt keyword &gt  identifier
<dd>searches the database for an entry which contains identifier.
The default action is to do a broad search, looking for matches
in many fields: handle, name, nicknames, hostname, IP number,

<dt>SUBdisplay
<dd>same as '%' in identifier.
<p>

<dt>Full or '='
<dd>shows detailed display for each match.
<p>

<dt>SUMmary or '$'
<dd>shows summary always, even if just one match.
</dl><p>

Special characters may be used in identifier to specify the
search:

<p>

<dt>!
<dd>before identifier will cause a handle-only search.
<p>

<dt>... or .
<dd>after identifier will cause a partial search: everything
starting with identifier will match.
<p>

<dt>@
<dd>in identifier will cause a search on the e-mail addresses.

<dt>*
<dd>before identifier will return the entire membership list of the
entry that match identifier (e.g., a site and its registered
users).
<p>

<dt>%
<dd>before identifier will return only the membership list of the
entry that matches identifier (e.g., the registered users of a

The special characters may be used together.
<p>

Except if  Full or SUMmary are  specified, the results are
displayed in one of 2 ways:
<p>
<ul>
<li> a full detailed display for a single match,

<h3>7. X.500</h3></a>
<p>

<a name="x5001">
<h4>7.1. What is X.500</h4></a>
<p>

X.500 is an OSI (Open System Information) based directory services
protocol designed by the CCITT (International Telegraph and Telephone
Consultative Committee).
<p>

X.500 provides distributed directory services to network users. The
X.500 directory specifies a model for connecting directory services
to form one distributed global directory. Each directory service
holds a part of the global database and the directory information is
made available via a server (called a Directory System Agent - DSA).
The database is maintained locally. From the user point of view, the
entire directory is accessible from the local server.
<p>

While most of the information available today via X.500 is about
people and organizations, the design of the X.500 directory is also
suitable for storing information about other entities (or objects),
such as network resources, applications or hardware. Several projects
are underway which utilize these directory capabilities (e.g., the
Internet RFCs (Request For Comments) are listed in the global
directory).
<p>

Each item (entry) in the X.500 directory describes one object (e.g.,
a person, a network resource, an organization) and has a
Distinguished Name - DN (a unique identifier). It consists of a
collection of attributes (e.g., last name, organization name, e-
mail,...- for a person).  The information held in the X.500 directory
(or Directory Information Base - DIB) is arranged hierarchically.
This organization is called the Directory Information Tree (DIT). At
the top-level is the root entry (the World), then the country level,
then the organization level, and, eventually, the people, the
resources, etc., at the bottom-level of the hierarchy.
<p>

<a name="x5002">
<h4>7.2. Who can use X.500</h4></a>
<p>

Although X.500 is part of the OSI standard definition, OSI access is
not necessary to use the directory services. Many X.500 services are
available on the Internet. In addition, users on any network can
access the X.500 directory by electronic mail. See the section Using
X.500 below for details.
<p>

<a name="x5003">
<h4>7.3. How to get to X.500</h4></a>
<p>

There are three ways to access the X.500 services: via a local
client, interactive session (Telnet or X.25 access) or electronic
mail. Each type of access is described below in the Using X.500
section.
<p>

In addition, other network tools (e.g., WWW and Gopher) provide
access to X.500 directory services through gateways.
<p>

Accessing a remote client is an easy way to start querying the X.500
directory. Some sites allow public access via Telnet or X.25 to a
client. Public access user interfaces are available at:

<h4>7.4. Using X.500</h4></a>
<p>

X.500 supports data management functions (addition, modification and
deletion of entries) and powerful lookup capabilities. The use of
X.500 is primarily for its lookup capabilities, ie, querying a
database for information on a person (postal address, telephone
number, e-mail address, etc.). The basic fields for searching are the
person's name, the name of the person's organization (and department
within the organization) and the country.
<p>

In the following, angle brackets ( &lt  &gt ) indicate an optional parameter;
a vertical (|) indicates a choice of parameters.
<p>

<a name="x50041">
<h5>7.4.1. Using a local client:</h5></a>
<p>

In the X.500 world, a local client is called a Directory User
Agent (DUA) Public domain and commercial DUAs are available for
numerous platforms ranging from mainframes to personal computers.
For a comprehensive list of DUAs, their description and where to
find them, consult the Internet document RFC 1292 - A Catalog of
Available X.500 Implementations.
<p>

Available DUAs range from simple line commands to sophisticated
graphical user interfaces which require a pointing device.
<p>

<a name="x50042">
<h5>7.4.2. Using Telnet or X.25:</h5></a>
<p>

3 categories of user interfaces might be available at the remote
site:
<p>
<ul>
<li> line-oriented: de, dish, fred
<li> menu-driven: sd (formerly known as widget)
<li> X-Windows-based: Xdi, Xlookup (or xlu), pod
</ul><p>

Capabilities of these DUAs range from basic search facilities to
full X.500 functionality.
<p>

de (directory enquiries) is recommended for novice users since it
is a very simple user-interface. It has been designed to run as a
public access DUA and is accessible from any kind of terminal. It
supports the basic X.500 functions: read, search, list. The Simple
query mode is suitable for those who are new to querying the X.500
directory.
<p>
<dl>
<dt>de
<dd>invokes the X.500 interrogation user-interface.
<p>

<dt>q
<dd>exits de.
<p>

<dt>? &lt topic &gt
<dd>displays the on-line help on the specified topic or general
help.
<p>

<dt>^C
<dd>(Ctrl-C) is the interrupt character. It aborts a search in
progress or resets the current query specification.
<p>

<dt>*
<dd>(asterisk) will list all entries of the specified field. It is
also the wildcard character and can replace any other character
in a name. It can appears anywhere in the name, e.g.: smit* or
*smit* are valid string formats.
<p>

<dt>-
<dd>resets the default value to a blank string.
</dl>
<p>

When de is invoked, the user is requested to fill in 4 fields to
specify a request. In all fields, the value from the previous
request is the default value. Press the RETURN key to accept it,
or enter a new value.  All searches are case insensitive.
<p>

The four fields to be filled in are:
<p>
<dl>
<dt>Person's name
<dd>Wildcard characters may be used anywhere in the name. All
matching names will be listed. Typing only "*" will match all
people of the specified department or organization. If this
field is blank, the search will be on department or
organization only.
<p>

<dt>Department name
<dd>the name (or an acronym) of the department in the organization
where the person works. Wildcard characters may be used
anywhere in the name.  Typing only "*" will match all
departments. If no person's name has been entered, details on
the department are displayed, otherwise, the search is carried
out with the selected name. If no department name is given, all
departments will be searched. This field could be omitted in
small organizations.
<p>

<dt>Organization name
<dd>the name  (or an acronym)  of the  organization where the
person works.  Wildcard characters  may be used anywhere  in
the name. Typing  only "*" will match all organizations. If no
person's name or department name has been entered, details on
the organization are displayed, otherwise, the search is
carried out with the selected name.
<p>

<dt>Country name
<dd>the name of the country where the person works. Typing "*" will
list all countries. The country name could be the 2-letter
country code (e.g., DK stands for Denmark), the name or a part
of it without wildcards (e.g., nether instead of The
Netherlands).
</dl>
<p>

If a large number of matching entries are found, they are listed
so that the user can select one entry to get further details.
<p>

<a name="x50043">
<h5>7.4.3. Using electronic mail:</h5></a>
<p>

The Norwegian networking organization (UNINETT) offers an e-mail
interface to X.500. To use it, send a mail message to:
Directory@UNINETT.NO with the word find in the Subject: field. The
body part contains the search request, one per message.
<p>

The format of the search request is:
<p><pre>
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                               |
|  find       &lt person-name &gt    &lt : org-name   &lt ;  country-name &gt  &gt   |  |
|             &lt ; country-name &gt                                    |
|                                                               |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
</pre><p>
<p>

If org-name and country-name are omitted, the sender's
organization name and country name are used as default values. The
mail interface guesses these values from the From: field of your
mail, so the results can be surprising if your address ends with
.bitnet!
<p>

"*" (asterisk) is the wildcard character and can replace any other
characters in any name. It can appear anywhere in the name.
<p>

The result of the query is sent back in a mail message. The search
is case insensitive.
<p>

Note: To avoid overloading the directory service, users are not
allowed to search for a person without selecting an organization.
To receive a help file, send the word help instead of a find
command.
<p>

<a name="x5005">
<h4>7.5. Examples</h4></a>

<h3>8. NETFIND</h3></a>
<p>

<a name="netfind1">
<h4>8.1. What is NETFIND</h4></a>
<p>

NETFIND is an Internet user directory tool. It provides a simple
Internet white pages directory facility.
<p>

Given the name of a person on the Internet and a rough description of
where the person works, Netfind attempts to locate telephone and
electronic mailbox information about the person. It does so using a
seed database of domains and hosts in the network.
<p>

Netfind finds information about people through the Internet protocols
SMTP and finger. If the person being sought is at a site that is not
directly connected to the Internet (e.g., the site is connected only
through a mail forwarding gateway), Netfind informs the user that the
person can not be found.
<p>

Due to the dynamic nature of Netfind's search procedures and
variations in Internet availability, different results can be
obtained for the same search on different occasions.
<p>

The Netfind software can only run on Suns running SunOS 4.0 or more
recent.
<p>

<a name="netfind2">
<h4>8.2. Who can use NETFIND</h4></a>
<p>

You must be on the international TCP/IP network (the Internet) in
order to use Netfind. Moreover, Netfind can only find information on
users who are on the Internet.
<p>

There is no e-mail access to Netfind.
<p>

<a name="netfind3">
<h4>8.3. How to get to NETFIND</h4></a>
<p>

You can access Netfind through software at your site (local access),
or you can use Telnet to access it at one of the following hosts
(remote access) and log in as netfind, no password is needed.

<h4>8.4. Using NETFIND</h4></a>
<p>

To use Netfind, you give it the name of a person and keywords
indicating where that person works. After you specify a search,
Netfind looks in its seed database to find domains matching the
specified keywords. If there is more than one matching domain,
Netfind displays the list of matching domains, and asks you to select
up to three to search. If the keys you specified match more than 100
domains, Netfind will list some of the matching domains/organizations
and ask you to form a more specific search. You can use any of the
parts of an organization's name (or any of the components of its
domain name) as keys in searches. Using more than one key implies the
logical AND of the keys. Specifying too many keys may cause searches
to fail.
<p>

When it completes the search (or when interrupted by  &lt circ &gt C),
Netfind summarizes the search results. The summary includes problems
searching remote domains, information about the most promising e-mail
address for the person being sought (if available), and information
about when and where the person most recently/is currently logged in
(if available).  If more than one person is located by a search, the
summary does not include information about e-mail targets and most
recent/current logins (since only the user can decide which person
was the correct one)

begin searching individual machines found in the seed database.
This option exists for measurement purposes. It is not of much
use to casual users.
<p>

<dt>-s
<dd>will disable usage of the SMTP protocol during searches. This
option is mainly useful for measurement purposes. Without this
protocol, searches will begin producing finger output slightly
sooner, but will often search less useful machines, generate
more Internet load, and fail to find information for users at
sites that do not support finger (such as many companies).
<p>

<dt>-t
<dd>will report how many timeouts occurred. The -T option will set
the timeout interval to the specified number of seconds. It may
be necessary to use this option to increase the timeout value
for intercontinental searches.
<p>

<dt>-D
<dd>sets the maximum number of domains that Netfind will search at
once. The default is 3. While it may seem convenient to set a
high value for this number, we suggest you do not do this. The
search will actually proceed faster (and waste less Internet
bandwidth) if a small number of well chosen domains are
searched.
<p>

<dt>-H
<dd>sets the maximum number of machines that will be searched by
Netfind.  The default value is 50. Again, we suggest that you
do not set this value higher.
<p>

<dt>-m
<dd>displays measurement information. If no filename is specified,
measurements are output to stderr. The packet count estimates
are usually exaggerated, because they make pessimistic
assumptions about the state of the Domain Naming System.
<p>

<dt>-d
<dd>allows you to turn on various classes of debugging output (all
of which are output to stderr), using a letter corresponding to
each one.  Debugging output is enabled using the -d option with
a list of letters, e.g., -dslf. The following classes/letters
exist:
<p>

<dl>

<dt>c:
<dd>display control messages (check if the program has reached a
specified point)
<p>

<dt>f:
<dd>display finger related messages
<p>

<dt>h:
<dd>list machine names found in the seed database
<p>

<dt>l:
<dd>display lock related messages (when entering monitors)
<p>

<dt>m:
<dd>display messages about mail protocol (SMTP)
<p>

<dt>n:
<dd>display messages about network failures
<p>

<dt>r:
<dd>display hosts matched from the seed database that were
rejected from searches because of search scope selection
<p>

<dt>s:
<dd>display system call related messages
<p>

<dt>t:
<dd>display thread related messages
<p>

<dt>A:
<dd>convert the above flags to mean their complement (example
-dAt means produce all debug output except that for
threads).
</dl>
<p>

The letters that are most likely to be of interest to the
casual user are f, m, and n. By default, these options are
enabled. Specifying any of these three flags with -d on the
command line will disable them (hence, the -d option toggles
the default behavior of each of the flags).
<p>

The name keyword specifies the person being sought by first,
last, or login name (only one name can be specified).
<p>

The place keywords describe where the person works, by either
the name of the institution or the city/state/country. If you
know the institution's domain name (e.g., cs.colorado.edu,
where there are host names like brazil.cs.colorado.edu) you can
specify it as keys without the dots (e.g., cs colorado edu).
The host parts of domain names (brazil) cannot be used as
keywords. Keys are case insensitive and may be specified in any
order, although using a very common key (like university) first
will cause internal buffers to overflow and some domains to be
missed.
<p>

Using more than one key implies the logical and of the keys.
Specifying too many keys may cause searches to fail. If this
happens, try specifying fewer keys.

<h4>9.1. What is TRICKLE</h4></a>
<p>

TRICKLE is a service which will send you files on request or by
subscription. TRICKLE works with various anonymous FTP sites
(computers in the Internet network that allow public access and
retrieval of software and files). It provides a quick and easy
alternative to FTP, whether or not you have access to the Internet.
<p>

There are several TRICKLE servers throughout the world that cooperate
to distribute the files efficiently. To request files, the user
issues commands to the nearest TRICKLE server, which delivers the
software either from its local cache disk, from the cache of another
TRICKLE server, or from an FTP site that holds the software.
<p>

<a name="trickle2">
<h4>9.2. Who can use TRICKLE</h4></a>

Not all directories are available at all servers. If your closest
server does not provide the directory of your choice, you can use any
other TRICKLE for the missing directory. If your closest server is
temporarily unavailable, you can use any other TRICKLE instead.
<p>

<a name="trickle3">
<h4>9.3. How to get to TRICKLE</h4></a>
<p>

You send commands to TRICKLE by electronic mail. The commands should
be in the body of the mail message, one command per line. Any number
of commands (up to your daily command limit) may be placed in one
message.  Users on the EARN/Bitnet network may also send commands to
TRICKLE by interactive message.
<p>

<a name="trickle4">
<h4>9.4. Using TRICKLE</h4></a>
<p>

All commands begin with a slash (/). Note that the angle brackets
( &lt  &gt ) are part of the command, not an indication of an optional
parameter.
<p>

Use the /PDDIR command to obtain directory listings.
<p><pre>

<dt>subdirname
<dd>is the name of a subdirectory,
<p>

<dt>pattern
<dd>is part of a filename.
</dl>
<p>

Use /PDDIR without any parameters to get a listing of the main
directories. With PDDIR  &lt dirname &gt  you will get a listing of the
subdirectories under that directory. If you specify both directory
and subdirectory, it will list the files that are available in that
subdirectory. With pattern, you will get a listing of only those
files that match or begin with that pattern. Wildcards "?" and "*"
may be imbedded into subdirname and pattern ("?" matches any single
character; "*" matches any number of characters).
<p>

Use the /PDGET command to get files.

<p>

<dt>filename
<dd>is the name of a file.
<p>

<dt>delivery-option

before being sent to you. The possible values are:
<p>
<pre>
EBC80  UUE  XXE  HEX  BTOA
</pre>
<p>

The option EBC80 should be used to get text files if you work on
an IBM mainframe system. The other options are formats for
translating binary files so that they can be sent via electronic
mail. You will need a program to translate the file back to its
original form. The default for EARN/Bitnet users is to send the
file as-is. The default for others is UUE.
<p>

Wildcards "?" and "*" may be imbedded into subdirname and filename
("?" matches any single character; "*" matches any number of
characters) to get several files.

The /SUB command is used to subscribe to directories or to individual

<p>

If you subscribe to a directory, you will get a summary of added
files about once a week, depending on how active the FTP site is.
This listing shows the names, sizes and dates of each file added. If
you subscribe to a file, as soon as TRICKLE is informed that a new
version of the file has been stored at its FTP site, a copy of the
file will be sent to you.
<p>

Note that since filenames usually reflect the version number of the
file, it is a good idea to omit the number when specifying a pattern.
For example, it is better to send the command:
<p>
<pre>
/SUB  &lt MSDOS.VIRUS &gt SCANV
</pre>
<p>

rather than
<p>
<pre>
/SUB  &lt MSDOS.VIRUS &gt SCANV106
</pre>
<p>

since, as new versions of the file are stored, the name might change
to SCANV107, SCANV108, etc.
<p>

Wildcards are not allowed with the /SUB command.
<p>

The /SUB QUERY command allows you to get a list of the files you are
subscribed to.
<p>

The /UNSUB command may be used to cancel a subscription.

<h4>10.1. What is BITFTP</h4></a>
<p>

BITFTP, BITNET FTP Server, allows users of EARN, Bitnet and
associated networks to access FTP sites on the Internet.
<p>

The BITFTP server provides a mail interface between a user on the
EARN/Bitnet network to FTP sites on the Internet. BITFTP handles this
task by passing the commands specified in the mail message from the
user to another server that actually makes the connection to the FTP
sites.  When the server finishes the interaction with the FTP site,
or fails due to an error, a transcript of the result is sent back to
the user, as well as the requested file(s), if any.
<p>

The format of the files sent to the user can be defined within the
mail message. BITFTP can deliver files in netdata and uuencode
formats.
<p>

<a name="bitftp2">
<h4>10.2. Who can use BITFTP</h4></a>
<p>

BITFTP is currently available only to users on EARN, Bitnet and other
regional NJE networks. BITFTP does not support multiple file requests
via the mget command nor does it support sending files to FTP sites

<p><pre>
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                               |
|  BITFTP@DEARN.BITNET  or  BITFTP@VM.GMD.DE           Germany  |
|  BITFTP@PUCC.BITNET   or  BITFTP@PUCC.PRINCETON.EDU  USA      |
|                                                               |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
</pre><p>
<p>

Users on the EARN/Bitnet international network only may use the US
server. Only users from EARN member countries may use the server in
Germany. Servers at other locations are planned.
<p>

BITFTP accepts requests via electronic mail, including IBM NOTE and
PROFS-format messages, as well as by NJE file transfer.

<h4>10.4. Using BITFTP</h4></a>
<p>

BITFTP implements a large subset of the FTP commands of the IBM's
TCP/IP for VM, using the same syntax. This software is documented in
the IBM manual TCP/IP for VM User's Guide. In the following, angle
brackets ( &lt  &gt ) indicate an optional parameter.
<p>

Use the ftp command to specify which host to connect to. This command
must be the first command in your mail file. You can also specify the
file format that you wish BITFTP to use to deliver files to you.
<p>

<p><pre>
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                               |
|  ftp       hostname  &lt fileformat &gt                               |
|                                                               |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
</pre><p>
<p>

where:
<p>
<dl>
<dt>hostname
<dd>is either the IP address or the domain name of the host to connect
to,
<p>

<dt>fileformat
<dd>is the format in which BITFTP should deliver files to you. It can
be either netdata or uuencode.
</dl>
<p>

Use the user command to tell the host the username and the password
to be used for the FTP connection. Note that on many FTP sites, both
username and password are case-sensitive.
<p><pre>
<p>

+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                               |
|  user      username password                                  |
|                                                               |

</pre><p>
<p>

where:
<p>
<dl>
<dt>username
<dd>is the user-id to use for the FTP connection,
<p>

<dt>password
<dd>is the password for the username you specified. It can be omitted
if you specified anonymous for the userid.
</dl>
<p>

Use the  cd command to select  a particular directory  as current
directory.
<p><pre>
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                               |

+---------------------------------------------------------------+
</pre><p>
<p>

where:
<p>
<dl>
<dt>directory-name
<dd>is the name of the directory to be selected.
</dl>
<p>

Use the dir command to display a list of the files in the current, or
specified, directory. The file names, and depending on the site, the
file size, file creation date and other information will be listed.
<p>

<p><pre>
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                               |

+---------------------------------------------------------------+
</pre><p>
<p>

where:
<p>
<dl>
<dt>pattern
<dd>is a pattern that defines which file names should be displayed.
Many FTP sites are case-sensitive, thus care must be used with the
pattern. The pattern may contain any number of characters, and the
wildcard character "*" (asterisk) may be used to represent any
characters.
</dl>
<p>

The ls command is similar to the dir command, except that with most
FTP sites, it only displays the filenames, without any other
information.  The pattern specification is identical to dir.
<p><pre>
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                               |

+---------------------------------------------------------------+
</pre><p>
Use the get command to obtain a file from the current host.
<p><pre>
+---------------------------------------------------------------+

+---------------------------------------------------------------+
</pre><p>
<p>

where:
<p>
<dl>
<dt>foreignname
<dd>is the filename of the file, as stored at the FTP site. With many
sites, the case of the filename must be respected.
<p>

<dt>localname
<dd>is an optional local filename. If you specify a localname, it must
be in the form:  filename.filetype where neither part is  longer
than eight characters.
</dl>
<p>

Use the binary command to set the FTP transfer mode. If this option
is set then no EBCDIC-ASCII translation will take place. This should
be used for non-text files.
<p><pre>
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                               |

Use the quit command to close the connection to the host, and to
terminate the BITFTP session.

<h4>10.6. Learning more about BITFTP</h4></a>
<p>

A four-page instruction to the BITFTP service can be obtained by
sending a help command in the body of a mail message to either BITFTP
server.
<p>

Additional information on BITFTP may be obtained from EARN
(NETHELP@EARNCC.EARN.NET or NETHELP@EARNCC.BITNET). More information
about TCP/IP and FTP in general can be obtained from a wide variety
of sources, such as the documents mentioned in the example above.

<h3>11. LISTSERV (Version 1.7f)</h3></a>
<p>

<a name="listserv1">
<h4>11.1. What is LISTSERV</h4></a>
<p>

LISTSERV is a distribution list management package. It runs on IBM
VM/CMS systems in the international NJE network (EARN/ Bitnet). It
allows groups of computer users with a common interest to communicate
among themselves, while making efficient use of computer and network
resources. It makes it easy for even novice users to discover, join,
and participate in these interest group mailing lists. LISTSERV also
provides facilities for logging and archiving of mail traffic, file
server functions, and database searches of archives and files.
<p>

There are LISTSERV lists on every subject under the sun, with names
ranging from AARPUB-L (AAR Electronic Publication list) to Z3950IW
(Z39.50 Implementors Workshop). LISTSERV lists are international and
eclectic. You will find lists in every imaginable field, for every
audience, in many different countries and in many different
languages.  See the description of the List command in the section
Using LISTSERV section for instructions on getting an up-to-date list
of lists.
<p>

<a name="listserv2">
<h4>11.2. Who can use LISTSERV</h4></a>
<p>

Anyone who can send electronic mail to an EARN/Bitnet address can
participate in a mailing list and access other LISTSERV facilities,
as long as the e-mail format is valid (according to the RFC822
standard), and has a usable return address. Every day, people use
LISTSERV from HEPnet, Internet, Compuserve, MCIMail and many other
networks throughout the world.
<p>

If you don't know how to send electronic mail to EARN/Bitnet, ask
your local support people for help.
<p>

<a name="listserv3">
<h4>11.3. How to get to LISTSERV</h4></a>
<p>

To use LISTSERV facilities, send electronic mail with your LISTSERV
commands to: LISTSERV@host-id where host-id is the host computer's
NJE address (for example, TAUNIVM.BITNET) or its Internet domain name
(in this case, VM.TAU.AC.IL). There may be some local variation on
the format needed to send mail to Bitnet or Internet addresses. Check
with your local support personnel.
<p>

More than one command can be sent to LISTSERV in the same mail
message.  Each command must be on a separate line. LISTSERV will
ignore the Subject: line of the mail header, so ensure that your
commands are in the body of the e-mail.
<p>

For EARN/Bitnet users, interactive messages are the fastest and most
convenient way to send commands to LISTSERV, but bear in mind that
interactive messages only work when the links between your computer
and LISTSERV are up; if the message fails, you can always send your
command via mail.
<p>

To facilitate communications with the LISTSERV servers on the
EARN/Bitnet network, a special LISTSERV computer node has been
defined.  This means that any EARN/Bitnet user can address their
commands to the userid LISTSERV at the special node LISTSERV.
<p>

All non-EARN/Bitnet users may address their command mail to the
userid LISTSERV at the special node LISTSERV.NET. Note that if this
node is not yet defined on your network, you may also try
LISTSERV%LISTSERV.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU. For example, if you wanted
to join the 3D-L mailing list that discusses 3D computer graphics but
are not sure of the address of the LISTSERV server hosting this list.
You could send a subscription request to either of the following
addresses:
<p>

<br>LISTSERV@LISTSERV.NET
<br>LISTSERV@LISTSERV (on BITNET)
<p>


Your subscription request will be automatically forwarded on to the
LISTSERV server hosting the 3D-L mailing list (in this case, at the
computer node ARIZVM1 or ARIZVM1.CCIT.ARIZONA.EDU).
<p>

You may also utilize the special LISTSERV address to send e-mail to
any LISTSERV mailing list if you are unsure of its address. For
example, if you wanted to send mail to the BITFTP-L mailing list to
request a copy of the BITFTP product, you could do so by addressing
your e-mail to BITFTP-L@LISTSERV.NET. It will automatically be
forwarded to the list's real address (in this case,
BITFTP-L@EARNCC.EARN.NET) when it reaches the LISTSERV node. Once you
know the real address of a list, it should be used for all future
mail sent to that list.
<p>

There are more than 250 sites in over 30 countries throughout the
world running LISTSERV as part of the world-wide network. Here are a
few of the LISTSERV sites:

<h4>11.4. Using LISTSERV</h4></a>
<p>

The commands given here are available for everyone and require no
special LISTSERV command privileges. Only the most common commands
are described. For a complete list of non-privileged LISTSERV
commands, retrieve the LISTSERV User Guide in the DOC FILELIST from
LISTSERV@EARNCC.EARN.NET (or LISTSERV@EARNCC.BITNET).
<p>

Commands are presented in a particular format: CAPITAL letters
indicate acceptable abbreviation, angle brackets ( &lt  &gt ) indicate an
optional parameter, and vertical bar (|) indicates a choice of
parameters. All parameters are fully explained in each command
description.
<p>

There is a standard set of command keywords available for use in some
LISTSERV commands. They may be used with any commands where they
appear as optional parameters in the command description. The
important standard keywords are:
<p>
<dl>
<dt>PW= password
<dd>This keyword is used to specify a password in a command. If you
have registered a personal password on a LISTSERV server, you will
then have to validate certain commands by using the PW= command
keyword in the command text. This feature is designed to prevent
impostors from issuing commands while using your e-mail address.
The use of passwords is strongly recommended for this reason. See
the PW command for details on registering personal passwords. Once
you have registered a personal password at a LISTSERV server, you
will be obliged to include the PW= command keyword in all commands
where it appears as an option.
<p>

<dt>F= format
<dd>This keyword controls the file format (or internal file structure)
in which files will be sent to you. If you are not a member of the
EARN/Bitnet network, then LISTSERV will always use the default
file format of MAIL. Otherwise, the default file format is
dependent upon the information held in the BITEARN NODES file
regarding your computer. The BITEARN NODES file is a special
network definition file used in the EARN/Bitnet network. Any user
may ask for a file format other than their default by specifying
it in the F= command keyword in the commands where it appears as
an option. Note that this will not permanently change your default
file format, its effect is only for those commands where it is
specified. Following is a list of file formats that are valid for
all users:
<p>

XXE  UUe  MIME/text  MIME/Appl  MAIL
</dl>
<p>

In addition, EARN/Bitnet users may specify:
<p>

Netdata  Card  Disk  Punch  LPunch  VMSdump
<p>

Contact your local support personnel for more information about
the file formats supported on your computer.

<a name="listserv41">
<h5>11.4.1. Commands for LISTS:</h5></a>
<p>

The primary function of LISTSERV is to operate mailing lists (also
referred to as distribution lists). Mailing lists are used to
distribute the e-mail sent to them to a list a recipients. They
provide the means for a group of users to establish an e-mail
forum on any topic or area of common interest. This service
provides an extremely convenient means for the exchange of ideas
and information between list members since LISTSERV (and not the
mail sender) manages the distribution of e-mail to all of its
final recipients. Users need only to remember one list address to
which they send their mail in order to communicate to a
potentially large number of users. Due to the efficiency with
which LISTSERV distributes e-mail to list members, discussions or
debates with a world-wide audience may be conducted.
<p>

The following commands are designed for use with LISTSERV mailing
lists.  With them you may do things such as finding the names and
addresses of lists, signing on to or off lists, reviewing lists or
changing your personal options for any mailing list to which you
are subscribed.
<p><pre>
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                               |
|  SUBscribe list-name   &lt full-name &gt                              |
|                                                               |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
</pre><p>
<p>

Use the SUBscribe command to join a mailing list. You can also use
this command to alter the name (but not e-mail address) by which
you are known on a mailing list you have already joined. The
list-name parameter is the name of the list to which you want to
subscribe. For example, the EARN User Group list located at the
node IRLEARN has a list name of EARN-UG. Do not confuse this with
the list's address (EARN-UG@IRLEARN) which should not be used. The
optional full-name parameter allows you to give a name by which
you want to be known on a mailing list. If specified, it should be
your full, real name (at least your first name and last name) and
not your e-mail address. If you send this command to LISTSERV via
command mail, the name for the full-name option will be taken from
the name given in the From: mail header should it be omitted from
the command text. If you send a SUBscribe command for a list to
which you already belong, then LISTSERV will interpret the command
as a request to change your full-name on the list.
<p>

A request to join a mailing list can be processed in three ways:
subscription to a list may be OPEN, CLOSED, or BY-OWNER. If it is
OPEN, you will be automatically added to the list and sent
notification. If it is CLOSED, you will not be added to the list,
and LISTSERV will send you a message telling you that your request
has been rejected. If it is BY-OWNER, your subscription request
will be forwarded to the list owner(s), who will decide whether or
not to add you to the list (LISTSERV will inform you to whom your
request has been forwarded). To see what kind of subscription a
list has, use the REView command.
<p><pre>
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                               |
|  UNSubscribe list-name  |  *   &lt (NETWIDE &gt                       |
|                                                               |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
</pre><p>
Use the UNSubscribe command to leave a mailing list. The listname
parameter is the name of a mailing list from which you want to
remove your subscription. You can signoff all the lists to which
you are a member at any particular LISTSERV site by using the "*"
(asterisk) character in the place of a list name. If you want your
UNSubscribe command to be propagated to all LISTSERV servers on
the network, include the (NETWIDE option. Use this option if you
are changing your e-mail address or are leaving your computer for
an extended period.

Use the List command to get a listing of available mailing lists
at a LISTSERV server. The options parameter may be any of the
following:
<p>
<dl>
<dt>Short
<dd>This option displays a summary of all the lists managed by a
LISTSERV in a brief, one line description. This is the default.
<p>

<dt>Long
<dd>The Long (or Detailed) option will send a file (called
node-name LISTS) to you that contains a comprehensive
description of the lists managed by a LISTSERV server.
<p>

<dt>Global  &lt pattern &gt
<dd>This option gives a complete list of all known LISTSERV mailing
lists at all servers at the time the command is issued. A file
(called LISTSERV LISTS) will be sent to you containing the
names, titles and e-mail addresses of these lists. This is a
very large file, so make sure you have the necessary disk space
to accommodate its size before you use the Global option. The
optional pattern parameter can be used to match any string in
the list name, list title or list address.

Use the REView command to receive a listing of a mailing list. It
will be sent to you as a file called list-name LIST (or list-name
node-name for peered lists). A mailing list is comprised of two
parts: a control section and a subscription section. The control
section holds the definition parameters for a list which includes
information such as who is authorized to review or join a list and
whether or not it is archived. The subscription section holds the
e-mail addresses and names of all list members. The REView command
allows you to receive a listing of either or both of these
sections (the default is both) for any list, provided you are
authorized to do so. Note that at the discretion of the list
owner(s), the REView command can be restricted in use to list
members only. In this case, you will not be authorized to review a
mailing list if you are not a member of that list yourself. Also,
individual list members can restrict the appearance of their
e-mail address and name in response to a REView command if they
have set the CONCEAL mailing list option (see the SET command for
more details). The list-name parameter is the name of the LISTSERV
list you wish to review.  The important options are:
<p>
<dl>
<dt>Short
<dd>This option restricts the information you receive to the
control section of a list (giving its definition parameters)
and does not return the subscription section of a list (giving
the list members).
<p>

<dt>Countries
<dd>If you use this option, the list of members will be by the
nationality given in their e-mail.
<p>

<dt>LOCal
<dd>If the list is peered (that is, it is linked to other mailing
lists of the same name but on different LISTSERV servers), you
will receive listings of all of these mailing lists in response
to a REView command.  The LOCal option can be used to suppress
the propagation of the REView command to the LISTSERV servers
hosting these peered mailing lists. In this case, you will
receive a listing only from the server to which you send the
REView command and not the others.

When you join any mailing list, you will be assigned a default set
of list options that control such things as way you received mail
when it is distributed and the type of notification LISTSERV will
give you when it distributes mail you have sent to a list. These
are the personal list options that may be altered on any mailing
list to which you are subscribed to suite your circumstances. See
the SET command for a complete descriptions of these options. The
Query command can be used to review the personal list options you
have in effect at any mailing list.  The listname parameter is the
name of a list to which you are subscribed. If you use an "*"
(asterisk) character instead of a list name, you will receive
information about your personal options for all lists to which you
belong at the LISTSERV to which you send the command.

Use the SET command to change your personal options for a mailing
list.  These options will remain in effect until they are
explicitly changed.  The Query command can be used to display your
current optional settings for any list to which you are
subscribed. The list-name parameter is the name of the mailing
list for which you are changing your options. You may change your
options for a specific list or for all the lists you belong to at
a particular LISTSERV by using the "*" (asterisk) character in
place of a list name. After processing your SET command, LISTSERV
will send you conformation of the successful alteration of your
mailing list options via e-mail. The important options are:
<p>
<dl>
<dt>Mail | DIGests | INDex | NOMail
<dd>These options of the SET command alter the way in which you
receive mail from a mailing list. The Mail option means that
you wish to have list mail distributed to you as mail. This is
the default. The DIGests and INDex options are available only
if a list has had these features enabled by its owner(s).
Digests hold all the mail messages sent to a list over a
certain period of time. Instead of receiving each mail
individually as it is distributed to list members, you will
receive all the mail in one batch for a given day, week or
month. You may then browse through these mail messages at your
leisure. Note that mail is not edited with the DIGests option,
you will receive copies of all the mail messages in their
entirety. The INDex option will provide you with only the date,
time, subject, number of lines and the sender's name and
address for all mail messages sent to a list. The text of the
mail message will not be included. You may then select and
retrieve any mail that interests you from the list archive.
Both the DIGests and INDex options provide a means of listening
in to discussions on mailing lists without having to deal with
large quantities of incoming mail messages.  The NOMail option
means that mail sent to the list will not be distributed to
you. This is useful when you are leaving your computer for an
extended period of time and you do not want mail from the list
to fill your mailbox. When you return, you can send the SET
command with the Mail option to restore mail service.
<p>

<dt>SHORThdr | FULLhdr | IETFhdr | DUALhdr
<dd>All mail messages are comprised of header and body sections.
The header section provides details such as the recipients, the
original sender and the date and time a mail message was sent.
The mail body section contains the text of a mail message.
These options of the SET command indicate the type of mail
headers you want to receive in the mail distributed from a
mailing list. SHORThdr means that the mail header will include
only the essential informational headers (for instance the
Date:, To:, From:, Subject:, Sender: and Reply-to: headers).
This is the default. You may change this to FULLhdr, which
means that all (including non-essential) mail headers will be
present in e-mail. The IETFhdr option means that LISTSERV will
not change the headers of a mail message it distributes to you
other than to add a Received: mail header (and also a
Message-id: and Sender: headers if either of these were not
already present). This option is designed specifically for
compatibility with SMTP exploders (as used, for instance, on
the Internet network).  Lastly, DUALhdr is very similar to the
SHORThdr option except that LISTSERV will also insert mail
headers at the beginning of the mail body. Therefore, when the
mail is received and read by a recipient using this option, it
will start with this information (for instance, the first three
lines of a mail message may contain the To:, From: and Subject:
mail headers). This option is useful for users of some PC based
mail packages that will not display this information from the
real mail headers.
<p>

<dt>CONCEAL | NOCONCEAL
<dd>Indicates whether or not you want your name and mail address to
appear in the display of list members which is given in
response to a REView command. The default is NOCONCEAL. Note
that a complete list of members is always given to list owners
and LISTSERV administrators regardless of this option.

Use  the CONFIRM  command to  renew your  subscription to  a
list.  Some mailing lists require subscription renewal at
regular intervals (usually once  a year).  A mail  message is
automatically sent  to list  members indicating that they  must
send a CONFIRM command within  a given number of days or they
will be removed from the list. This command must be sent from
the same e-mail address  that received the confirmation notice.
The list-name parameter  is the name  of the mailing  list to
which  you are confirming your  subscription. LISTSERV  will
send  a message  that your subscription has been confirmed.

<h5>11.4.2. Commands for FILES:</h5></a>
<p>

LISTSERV also functions as a file server. That is, files can be
stored at a LISTSERV server and made available for retrieval by
users upon their request. These files are stored in LISTSERV under
a hierarchical system of filelists. As the name suggests, a
filelist is a special file that holds a list of files. Each entry
in a filelist describes a file that is available for retrieval and
gives details such as the file's name and size and also a file's
access code (also known as a FAC) which describes who is
authorized to retrieve it. These files may themselves be
filelists, in which case they too will hold information about
available files or further filelists. In this way, filelists are
organized in a hierarchical or tree structure.
<p>

There are two basic types of filelists on LISTSERV servers. The
first type holds files that have been specifically placed there by
file owners or LISTSERV administrators. These files may be
documents, maps or diagrams, or even programs. The second type of
filelist is associated with a LISTSERV mailing list. These are
referred to as list filelists and retain copies of all e-mail
distributed on a particular mailing list. They consist of a series
of files, each of which holds a copy of the mail messages
distributed on a list over an interval of time (usually, one
month). These files may then be retrieved to recover any list mail
distributed during a specific period. Note that e-mail distributed
on a mailing list may also be retrieved via the database functions
of LISTSERV. Not all mailing lists have an associated list
filelist; this is enabled at a list owner's discretion.
<p>

A further aspect of the file server functions of LISTSERV is the
concept of packages. A package consists of one or more files that
appear in a filelist. These may be, for example, a series of files
that go to make up a software package. A package is declared in a
LISTSERV filelist through a file that has the special name of
package-name $PACKAGE.  Within it will be a list of all the files
that comprise the package.  This list can be reviewed by sending a
retrieval request for that file.  However, all the files that
comprise the package may also be retrieved through a request for
the file: package-name PACKAGE. Note that in this case, the "$"
(dollar) symbol is dropped from the name. The files that go to
make up the package will then automatically be sent to the
requestor. This enables users to retrieve an entire set of files
that belong to a package with only one command, instead of having
to retrieve each of these files individually through a series of
commands.
<p>

The following LISTSERV commands enable general users to manipulate
files that are stored at a server. This includes commands to
search for, retrieve and subscribe to files. When sending file
server commands to LISTSERV, you must address them to the server
and not to any mailing lists. Note that where the PW= keyword
appears in a command description, this need only be included in
the command text if you have defined a personal password at the
server to which you are sending file server commands. Otherwise,
it need not be used. The optional F= command keyword may included
as desired.

Use the INDex command to get a listing of the files in a

the filelist you wish to get. If no name is specified, an index of
the root filelist (called LISTSERV FILELIST) will be sent to you.

+---------------------------------------------------------------+
</pre><p>
The GET command is used to retrieve a specific file or package
from a filelist, provided you are authorized to do so. The
filename and filetype parameters identify the file or package you
wish to retrieve.  The optional filelist parameter identifies the
filelist within which the file or package resides. If it is not
supplied in the command, LISTSERV will determine the filelist
through a search of its own internal filelist index.

AFD is an acronym for Automatic File Distribution. This command
enables you to subscribe to a file or package in a filelist. Every
time this file or package is updated in its filelist, you will
then automatically be sent of copy of it by the LISTSERV server.
You may subscribe to any number of files for packages from any
filelist with the AFD command. You may also review or delete your
subscriptions at any LISTSERV server. The options must be one of
the following:
<p>
<dl>
<dt>ADD  filename  filetype   &lt filelist &gt   &lt text &gt   &lt PW= password &gt &lt F=format &gt
<dd>The ADD option allows you to subscribe to a file or package.
This means that a copy will henceforth be sent to you
automatically by LISTSERV when it is updated on its filelist.
The filename and filetype parameters identify a file or package
to which you want to subscribe. The filelist option allows you
to specify the name of the filelist in which it is located. If
this is not specified in the command, LISTSERV will locate the
filelist through a search of its own internal filelist index.
Also, if you wish to have an informational text message
inserted automatically at the top of the file or package when
it is sent to you, you may use the text parameter. Note that if
you omit the filelist option, the text you provide in the text
parameter must be enclosed in double quotes (").  This
parameter is most commonly used by network server applications
that subscribe to files at a LISTSERV on behalf of users. If
you are subscribing to files directly from LISTSERV yourself,
you should not need to use this option.
<p>

<dt>DELete  filename  filetype   &lt filelist &gt    &lt PW= password &gt
<dd>Remove your subscription to a file or package for which you
have an AFD.  The filename and filetype parameters identify a
file or package to which you wish to remove an AFD. These names
may also include the "*" (asterisk) wildcard character so that
multiple files or packages may be removed with one DELete
command. The filelist option allows you to specify the name of
the filelist in which it is located. If this is not specified
in the command, LISTSERV will locate the filelist through a
search of its own internal filelist index.
<p>

<dt>List  &lt (FORMAT &gt
<dd>The List option shows the files or packages to which you are
currently subscribed at a LISTSERV. If you include the (FORMAT
option, then the file format to be used when a file or package
is sent to you will also be displayed.

FUI is an acronym for File Update Information. It enables you to
subscribe to a file or package in a filelist. Every time this file
for package is updated in its filelist, you will then
automatically be informed of this by the LISTSERV server. This
command is similar to the AFD command, except you will only be
sent notification of an update rather than the updated file or
package itself. You may subscribe to any number of files for
packages from any filelist with the FUI command. You may also
review or delete your subscriptions at any LISTSERV server. The
options parameter must be one of the following:
<p>
<dl>
<dt>ADD filename  filetype  &lt filelist &gt   &lt PW=  password &gt
<dd>The ADD option allows you to subscribe to a file or package by
adding an FUI to it. The filename and filetype parameters
identify a file or package to which you want to add an FUI
subscription. The filelist option allows you to specify the
name of the filelist in which it is located. If this is not
given in the command, LISTSERV will locate the filelist through
a search of its own internal filelist index.
<p>

<dt>DELete  filename  filetype   &lt filelist &gt    &lt PW= password &gt
<dd>Remove your subscription from a file or package for which you
have an FUI. The filename and filetype parameters identify a
file or package to which you want to delete an FUI. The
filelist option allows you to specify the name of the filelist
in which it is located. If this is not specified in the
command, LISTSERV will locate the filelist through a search of
its own internal filelist index.

The PW command enables you to add, change or delete a personal
password on any LISTSERV server. A personal password is designed
to give you added command security on a LISTSERV since it helps
prevent impostors using your e-mail address. The use of personal
passwords is strongly encouraged for this reason. Every server
will accept a password registration request from you at any time.
Passwords are comprised of one to eight alphanumeric characters.
You may change or delete your password at any time. The options
parameter must be one of the following:
<p>
<dl>
<dt>ADD  new-password
<dd>Add a new personal password on the LISTSERV processing your
command.  Once you have registered a password on a LISTSERV
server, you will be obliged to use the PW= command keyword in
the commands where it appears as an option.
<p>

<dt>CHange  old-password  new-password
<dd>Change your personal password on a LISTSERV server where you
already have one.
<p>

<dt>DELete  old-password
<dd>Remove your personal password from a LISTSERV where you already
have one. Once you have removed a password from a LISTSERV
server, you will no longer be obliged to use the PW= command
keyword in the commands where it appears as an option.

<h5>11.4.3. LISTSERV DATABASE Functions</h5></a>
<p>

LISTSERV provides the facility for users to retrieve old mail that
has been distributed on mailing lists. Each mailing list has an
associated database (called a notebook or list archive database)
in which list mail is stored. Note that databases may not be
maintained for every mailing list, this is done at the discretion
of a list owner. The notebook databases are the most commonly used
of the LISTSERV databases. However, every LISTSERV server also has
a database of all the EARN/Bitnet computer nodes (called the
BITEARN database). This is available to all LISTSERV users. The
backbone LISTSERV servers also have a database of all the LISTSERV
computer nodes (called the PEERS database). In addition to these
databases, a LISTSERV server may have any number of different
databases that have been created locally. To find out what
databases are accessible at a particular LISTSERV site, send
following command to that server:
<p>

DATABASE LIST
<p>

To perform a database search, you can send mail to LISTSERV
containing a batch database job which contains your database
query. In addition, EARN/Bitnet users on VM or VMS systems can
access the database facilities interactively via the LDBASE
program. For more details on the LISTSERV database facilities,
send an Info DATABASE command to your nearest (or any) LISTSERV
server (see the section Commands for INFORMATION) or consult the
LISTSERV DATABASE Functions chapter in the LISTSERV User Guide.
<p>

<a name="listserv44">
<h5>11.4.4. Commands for INFORMATION:</h5></a>
<p>

The LISTSERV server can provide a diverse range of information to
the general user. This includes help files, release levels of the
server and important configuration files, statistics and
information pertaining to the EARN/Bitnet network. When sending
these commands to LISTSERV, they must be addressed to the server
and not to any mailing lists it may manage. For those commands
that result in files being sent to the requestor (for example the
Info command), the format of the file can be specified by the
optional command keyword F= in the command text (see the section
LISTSERV Command Keywords for more information).

<h3>12. NETNEWS (USENET)</h3></a>
<p>

<a name="netnews1">
<h4>12.1. What is NETNEWS</h4></a>
<p>

Netnews, or Usenet as it is more commonly called, is a message
sharing system that exchanges messages electronically around the
world in a standard format. Messages exchanged on Usenet are arranged
by topic into categories called newsgroups. Netnews is, thus, a huge
collection of messages, being passed from machine to machine. The
messages may contain both plain text and encoded binary information.
The messages also contain header lines that define who the message
came from, when the message was posted, where it was posted, where it
has passed, and other administrative information.
<p>

The major, hierarchical categories of Usenet newsgroups which are
distributed throughout the world are alt, comp, misc, news, rec, sci,
soc, and talk. There are many other major categories which may be
topical (e.g., bionet, biz, vmsnet) and are usually distributed
worldwide as well, or geographical and even organizational (e.g.,
ieee) or commercial (e.g., clari). The latter categories are usually
distributed only with their area of interest. The messages of many
Bitnet LISTSERV mailing lists are also distributed in Usenet under
the major category bit.
<p>

The major categories are further broken down into more than 1200
newsgroups on different subjects which range from education for the
disabled to Star Trek and from environmental science to politics in
the former Soviet Union. The quality of the discussion in newsgroups
is not guaranteed to be high. Some newsgroups have a moderator who
scans the messages for the group before they are distributed and
decides which ones are appropriate for distribution.
<p>

Usenet was originally developed for Unix systems in 1979. Within a
year, fifty Unix sites were participating. Now, there are thousands
of sites running a number of operating systems on a variety of
hardware platforms communicating via Usenet around the globe.
<p>

<a name="netnews2">
<h4>12.2. Who can use NETNEWS</h4></a>
<p>

Usenet newsgroups can be read at thousands of sites around the world.
In addition, there are several sites that provide public dial-up
service so that people who are not at a Usenet site can have access
to newsgroups as well. If you don't know if your site has Usenet
access, check with your local computer support people.
<p>

Protocols and software for the distribution of news are in use in
several networks, such as the Internet, UUCP, EARN/Bitnet and
Fidonet.
<p>

If you have e-mail service only, then you can not access Usenet.
However, many newsgroups are connected to mailing lists which you
could join. For a list of these newsgroups and their associated
mailing lists, send mail to LISTSERV@AMERICAN.EDU with the line: GET
NETGATE GATELIST.  Moreover, many of the documents which appear
periodically in newsgroups are available by e-mail from
mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu. For instructions, send a message with the
subject: HELP.
<p>

<a name="netnews3">
<h4>12.3. How to get to NETNEWS</h4></a>
<p>

If your site provides Usenet access, then you just need to use one of
the many software packages available for reading news (at least one
is probably available on your computer). These packages either access
a local news spool, or use the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP)
to access the news spool on some other computer in the network.
<p>

Within EARN, a network of Netnews distribution has been developed,
providing efficient distribution of Usenet traffic while minimizing
the load on the network for the participating countries.
<p>

If Usenet is not available to you and you would like to arrange
access for your site, contact your system administrator. You should
also read the article How to become a USENET site which is posted
periodically to the news.answers newsgroup. It is also available by
anonymous FTP from rtfm.mit.edu as
/pub/usenet/news.answers/site-setup or by mail to:
mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the line: send
usenet/news.answers/site-setup.
<p>

<a name="netnews4">
<h4>12.4. Using NETNEWS</h4></a>
<p>

There are many software packages available for reading and
distributing Netnews on a variety of operating systems (Unix, VMS,
VM/CMS, MVS, Macintosh, MS-DOS and OS/2) and environments (Emacs,
X-Windows, MS-Windows). See the list of freely available news reader
software packages in Appendix A. Note that the number of software
packages available to run news, especially on PCs, is increasing.
<p>

In addition to the software packages specifically designed to be news
readers, many other communications programs, particular mail
interfaces, provide the possibility for Usenet access in addition to
their main function.
<p>

Most, if not all, of the news readers provide the same basic
abilities:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Subscribing to newsgroups: This means that your news reading
software will make these groups immediately accessible, so that
you can choose to read the postings of groups that interest you
quickly and easily.
<p>

<li> Unsubscribing from newsgroups: Removing groups from your easy
access list.
<p>

<li> Reading newsgroup postings: Your news reader presents postings
to you and keeps track of which postings you have and have not
read.
<p>

<li> Threads of discussion: You can follow groups of postings that
deal with the same subject easily.
<p>

<li> Posting to news groups: You can participate in group
discussions; your news reader knows where to send your posting.
<p>

<li> Responding to a posting: You can send a response to the
newsgroup (often called follow-up) or to the author of a posting
(often called reply).
</ul>
<p>

You'll want to look particularly for dial up IP software (SLIP or

by scripting the session so that the users don't have to type
anything, perhaps by automatically dialing for you when you go to
read or otherwise open a network connection, and offering a
reasonable way to disconnect.

<h4>12.6. Learning more about NETNEWS</h4></a>
<p>

News programs communicate with each other according to standard
protocols, some of which are described by Internet Request For
Comments (RFC). Copies of RFCs are often posted to the network and
obtainable from archive sites. Current news-related RFCs include the
following:
<p>

RFC 977   specifies NNTP, the Network News Transfer Protocol,
<p>

RFC 1036  specifies the format of Usenet articles.
<p>

Some newsgroups carry articles and discussions on the use of Usenet,
notably: news.announce.newusers, news.answers and
news.newusers.questions.
<p>

Many of the articles which appear periodically in these newsgroups or
in others are also available from rtfm.mit.edu by anonymous FTP or by

<h4>13.1.1. What is ASTRA</h4></a>
<p>

The ASTRA service allows users to retrieve documents from databases
known by ASTRA throughout the network. Users can send their queries
to the ASTRA server which in turn forwards the query to the related
database servers. This provides an easy-to-use uniform access method
to a large number of databases.
<p>

ASTRA provides the same user interface for all databases it can
access, even if the database servers have different access languages,
such as STAIRS, ISIS or SQL.
<p>

Each database defined in ASTRA has an abstract which holds
information about the database: title, name of the maintainers, a
brief description of the database, the main topics of the database
and its language. Users are advised to look at the abstracts before
sending requests, to avoid sending requests to the wrong databases.
<p>

Some databases actually combine several different databases that deal
with the same topics. When a user sends a request for such a
database, the request is forwarded to all related databases.
<p>

<a name="astra2">
<h4>13.1.2. How to get to ASTRA</h4></a>
<p>

Anyone who can send electronic mail to EARN/Bitnet can access ASTRA.
Interactive user interfaces (clients) to ASTRA are available for VM
and VMS systems on the EARN/Bitnet network. For all other users,
there is a batch language that permits batch queries using e-mail.
<p>

Currently there are five ASTRA servers installed at the following

<h3>13.2. NETSERV</h3></a>
<p>

<a name="netserv1">
<h4>13.2.1 What is NETSERV</h4></a>
<p>

NETSERV is a server, which allows fast access to data files and
programs of interest to the EARN/Bitnet community. NETSERV provides a
file repository consisting of information files and programs. It
allows users to retrieve files, to store files and to subscribe to
the files of their choice. The latter two functions however, require
that the user have a password for NETSERV (this is called a
privileged user).
<p>

In order to achieve a balanced load on the network and a faster
response time to users, NETSERV uses a distributed server concept:
this is achieved by the installation of a large number of servers on
the network to ensure that the user can locate a nearby server. All
servers communicate with each other to distribute updated information
and make it available from each copy of the server.
<p>

NETSERV's file server functions include retrieving any file present
in its filelists, storing new versions of a file, and subscribing to
files stored on the server. Its file directories are arranged in an
hierarchical method, with NETSERV FILELIST being on top or at the
root of the filelists. This filelist can be obtained by sending a GET
NETSERV FILELIST command to any NETSERV. Filelists contain short
descriptions of the files, and two access codes for each file. These
codes represent the get and put privileges required for that file.
These codes are explained at the beginning of the NETSERV FILELIST
file.
<p>

<a name="netserv2">
<h4>13.2.2 How to get to NETSERV</h4></a>

The server is available in almost every country. To find the closest

</pre><p>
<p>

In EARN, there is only one NETSERV permitted for one country.
However, in some limited cases, such as when the country has a large
number of nodes, additional servers may be installed. In any case,
the user is not required to run NETSERV to be able to access and use
the server.
<p>

NETSERV accepts e-mail access from users on any network. Commands to
NETSERV should be placed in the body of the mail file, and not in the
Subject: line.
<p>

For users in the EARN/Bitnet network, NETSERV is accessible via
interactive message. Commands from privileged users requiring a
password must be sent this way.
<p>

NETSERV does not have delivery limitations, except that a file
ordered from NETSERV cannot be ordered again on the same day.
<p>

<h3>13.4. PROSPERO</h3></a>
<p>

<a name="prospero1">
<h4>13.4.1. What is PROSPERO</h4></a>
<p>

PROSPERO is a distributed file system. It differs from traditional
distributed file systems in several ways. In traditional file
systems, the mapping of names to files is the same for all users.
Prospero supports user centered naming: users construct customized
views of the files that are accessible. A virtual system defines this
view and controls the mapping from names to files. Objects may be
organized in multiple ways and the same object may appear in
different virtual systems, or even with multiple names in the same
virtual system.
<p>

In Prospero, the global file system consists of a collection of
virtual file systems. Virtual file systems usually start as a copy of
a prototype. The root contains links to files or directories selected
by the user.
<p>

The Prospero file system provides tools that make it easier to keep
track of and organize information in large systems. When first
created, your virtual file system is likely to contain links to
directories that organize information in different ways. As the
master copy of each of these directories is updated, you will see the
changes. You may customize these directories. The changes you make to
a customized directory are only seen from within your own virtual
system, but changes made to the master copy will also be visible to
you.
<p>

Users are encouraged to organize their own projects and papers in a
manner that will allow them to be easily added to the master
directory.  For example, users should consider creating a virtual
directory that contains pointers to copies of each of the papers that
they want made available to the outside world. This virtual directory
may appear anywhere in the user's virtual system. Once set up, a link
may be added to the master author directory. In this manner, others
will be able to find this directory. Once added to the master
directory, any future changes will be immediately available to other
users.
<p>

<a name="prospero2">
<h4>13.4.2. How to get to PROSPERO</h4></a>
<p>

In order to use Prospero, you must be on the international TCP/IP
network (the Internet) and you must have Prospero running on your
computer.
<p>

Before you can begin using the Prospero file system a virtual system
must be created for you. However, Prospero, as shipped, is configured
so that once you compile the clients you can type: vfsetup guest and
start working right out of the box using a guest virtual system at
the USC Information Sciences Institute.
<p>

The latest version of PROSPERO is available as file prospero.tar.Z
for anonymous FTP from prospero.isi.edu in the directory
/pub/prospero.
<p>

<a name="prospero3">
<h4>13.4.3. Learning more about PROSPERO</h4></a>

Prospero is being developed by Clifford Newman. Several documents and

<h3>13.5. IRC</h3></a>
<p>

<a name="irc1">
<h4>13.5.1. What is IRC</h4></a>
<p>

IRC, Internet Relay Chat, is a real-time conversational system. It is
similar to the talk command which is available on many machines in
the Internet. IRC does everything talk does, but it allows more than
2 users to talk at once, with access throughout the global Internet.
It also provides many other useful features.
<p>

IRC is networked over much of North America, Europe, and Asia. When
you are talking in IRC, everything you type will instantly be
transmitted around the world to other users who are connected at the
time. They can then type something and respond to your messages.
<p>

Topics of discussion on IRC are varied. Technical and political
discussions are popular, especially when world events are in
progress.  IRC is also a way to expand your horizons, as people from
many countries and cultures are on, 24 hours a day. Most
conversations are in English, but there are always channels in
German, Japanese, and Finnish, and occasionally other languages.
<p>

<a name="irc2">
<h4>13.5.2. How to get to IRC</h4></a>
<p>

Clients and servers for IRC are available via anonymous FTP from
cs.bu.edu. A few sites offer public access to IRC via Telnet. Two
such sites are wbrt.wb.psu.edu and irc.demon.co.uk. At both sites,
you should log in as irc.
<p>

The many server hosts of Internet Relay Chat throughout the network
are connected via a tree structure. The various servers relay control
and message data among themselves to advertise the existence of other
servers, users, and the channels and other resources being occupied
by those users.
<p>

Fundamental to the operation of IRC is the concept of a channel. All
users are on a channel while inside IRC. You enter the null channel
first. You cannot send any messages until you enter a chatting
channel, unless you have set up a private conversation in some way.
The number of channels is essentially unlimited.
<p>

<h4>13.5.3. Learning more about IRC</h4></a>
<p>

To get help while in IRC, type /help and follow the instructions.
<p>

If you have problems, you can contact Christopher Davis (ckd@eff.org)
or Helen Rose (hrose@eff.org) - known on IRC as ckd and Trillian,
respectively. You can also ask for help on some of the operator
channels on IRC, for example #twilight_zone and #eu-opers.
<p>

Various documents on IRC, and the archives of IRC-related mailing
lists, are available via anonymous FTP from ftp.kei.com.

<h3>13.6. RELAY</h3></a>
<p>
<a name="relay1">
<h4>13.6.1. What is RELAY</h4></a>
<p>

The RELAY server system is a set of servers in the global EARN/Bitnet
network which broadcast interactive messages from one user to other
users signed on to the same channel of the RELAY system. A user
signed on to the closest available RELAY is also virtually signed on
to all RELAYs which are linked to it. Most RELAYs are closed during
peak hours.  Only some RELAYs are up 24 hours a day.
<p>

Each RELAY server provides service to a specific collection of one or
more nodes designated as a service area. The functions of RELAY are
available to EARN/Bitnet users with access to interactive messages
who have not been expressly excluded from the system by RELAY
management.
<p>

RELAY is a program which allows several people to talk at the same
time.  In order to start, you must sign on to a RELAY to place your
ID in the current user list. You communicate with RELAY through
messages just as you would send messages to a user. RELAY commands
start with a slash (/) character; anything not beginning with a slash
is considered a message and is sent back out to all other current
users.
<p>

<a name="relay2">
<h4>13.6.2. How to get to RELAY</h4></a>
<p>

RELAY is available at the following EARN/Bitnet addresses, and
others.  The nickname of the RELAY machine is in parentheses.

RELAY is available to users on the EARN/Bitnet network via
interactive message (e.g., the TELL command of VM or the SEND command
of VMS/JNET).  All RELAY server machines are on IBM VM/CMS systems,
but you do not have to be a VM user in order to use RELAY. If you are
not in the EARN/Bitnet network, you can not use RELAY.
<p>

CHAT, a full-screen interface to send and receive TELL messages for
VM systems, is particularly useful for users of RELAY. CHAT is
available from any NETSERV.
