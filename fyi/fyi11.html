<h1>A Revised Catalog of Available X.500 Implementations</h1>
<p>

<a name="status">
<h3>Status of this Memo</h3></a>
<p>

This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo
does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Distribution of
this memo is unlimited.

<h3>Abstract</h3></a>
<p>

This document is the result of a survey that gathered new or updated
descriptions of currently available implementations of X.500,
including commercial products and openly available offerings. This
document is a revision of RFC 1292. We contacted each contributor in
RFC 1292 and requested an update and published the survey template in
several mailing lists and obtained new product descriptions.
<p>

This document contains detailed description of twenty six (26) X.500
implementations - DSAs, DUAs, and DUA interfaces.
<p>

<a name="intro">
<h3>1.  Introduction</h3></a>
<p>

This document catalogs currently available implementations of X.500,
including commercial products and openly available offerings.  For
the purposes of this survey, we classify X.500 products as,
<p>

<dl>
<dt>DSA
<dd>A DSA is an OSI application process that provides the Directory
functionality,
</dl>
<p>

<dl>
<dt>DUA
<dd>A DUA is an OSI application process that represents a user in
accessing the Directory and uses the DAP to communicate with a
DSA, and
</dl>
<p>

<dl>
<dt>DUA Interface
<dd>A DUA Interface is an application process that represents a user
in accessing the Directory using either DAP but supporting only
a subset of the DAP functionality or a protocol different from
DAP to communicate with a DSA or DUA.
</dl>
<p>

Section 2 of this document contains a listing of implementations
cross referenced by keyword.  This list should aid in identifying
implementations that meet your criteria.
<p>

To compile this catalog, the IDS Working Group solicited input from
the X.500 community by surveying several Internet mailing lists,
including:  iso@nic.ddn.mil, isode@nic.ddn.mil, osi-ds@cs.ucl.ac.uk,
and ietf-ids@umich.edu. We also contacted many people by telephone
and sent the template to several individuals and mailed a floppy disk
containing the survey template to a person who did not have Internet
access.
<p>

Readers are encouraged to submit comments regarding both the form and
content  of this  memo.  New submissions are welcome.  Please direct
input to  the  Integrated  Directory  Services  (IDS)  Working  Group
(ietf-ids@umich.edu)  or  to  the editors.  IDS will produce new versions 
of this document when a sufficient number of changes have  been
received.  This will be determined by the IDS chairpersons.
<p>

<a name="1.1">
<h4>1.1  Purpose</h4></a>
<p>

The Internet has experienced a steady growth in X.500 piloting
activities. This document hopes to provide an easily accessible
source of information on X.500 implementations for those who wish to
consider X.500 technology for deploying a Directory service.
<p>

<a name="1.2">
<h4>1.2  Scope</h4></a>
<p>

This document contains descriptions of both free and commercial X.500
implementations.  It does not provide instructions on how to install,
run, or manage these implementations.  The descriptions and indices
are provided to make the readers aware of available options and thus
enable more informed choices.
<p>

<a name="1.3">
<h4>1.3 Disclaimer</h4></a>
<p>

Implementation descriptions were written by implementors and vendors,
and not by the editors. We worked with the description authors to
ensure uniformity and readability, but can not guarantee the accuracy
or completeness of the descriptions, or the stability of the
implementations.
<p>

<a name="1.4">
<h4>1.4  Overview</h4></a>
<p>

Section 1 contains introductory information.
<p>

Section 2 contains a list of keywords, their definitions, and a cross
reference of the X.500 implementations by these keywords.
<p>

Section 3 contains the X.500 implementation descriptions.
<p>

Section 4 has a list of references.
<p>

Section 6 lists the editors' addresses.
<p>

<a name="1.5">
<h4>1.5  Acknowledgments</h4></a>
<p>

The creation of this catalog would not have been possible without the
efforts of the description authors and the members of the IDS Working
Group.  Our special thanks to the editors of RFC 1292, Ruth Lang and
Russ Wright who helped us get started and made key suggestions that
enabled us to learn from their experience. We also acknowledge and
appreciate the efforts of Ken Rossen in obtaining six descriptions.
<p>

<a name="keywords">
<h3>2.  Keywords</h3></a>
<p>

Keywords are abbreviated attributes of the X.500 implementations.
The list of keywords defined below was derived from the
implementation descriptions themselves.  Implementations were indexed
by a keyword either as a result of: (1) explicit, not implied,
reference to a particular capability in the implementation
description text, or (2) input from the implementation description
author(s).
<p>

<a name="2.1">
<h4>2.1  Keyword Definitions</h4></a>
<p>

This section contains keyword definitions.  They have been organized
and grouped by functional category. The definitions are ordered
first alphabetically by keyword category, and second alphabetically
by implementation name within keyword category.

<h4>2.2  Implementations Indexed by Keyword</h4></a>
<p>

This section contains an index of implementations by keyword.  You
can use this list to identify particular implementations that meet
your chosen criteria.
<p>

The index is organized as follows: keywords appear in alphabetical
order; implementations characterized by that keyword are listed
alphabetically as well.  Note that a "*" is used to indicate that the
particular implementation, or feature of the implementation, may not
be available at this time.
<p>

For formatting purposes, we have used the following abbreviations for
implementation names: BULL S.A. (Bull X500-DS and X500-DUA), DEC
X.500 DSA (DEC X.500 Directory Server), DEC X.500 Admin (DEC X.500
Administration Facility), HP X.500 DD (HP X.500 Distributed
Directory), LDAP (University of Michigan LDAP Implementation), OSI
Access  &amp  Dir (OSI Access and Directory), and Traxis (Traxis
Enterprise Directory).

<dl>
<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>X500-DS and X500-DUA are integral part of the large Bull OSI offer.
Although based on the DCE/GDS (Distributed Computing
Environment/Global Directory Service) of OSF, these two products may
be installed and used without DCE environment.  X500-DS is designed
to implement both the DUA and the DSA functions, whilst X500-DUA only
provides the DUA functions.
</dl>
<p>

The X500-DUA package contains:
<p>
<ul>
<li> The standards APIs XOM (X/Open OSI-Abstract-Data Manipulation API)
and XDS (X/Open Directory Service API) for the development of
portable applications,
<li> A core DUA to translate all user's requests (bind, read, list,
compare, modify, modifyRDN, search, add, remove, unbind ...) into
the DAP protocol used for communication with distant DSAs,
<li> The OSI standard protocols (ASN.1, ROSE, ACSE, Presentation and
Session) for communication with the distant DSAs. The interface
with the low layers of the stack being XTI. RFC-1006 is supported
under XTI or the Session,
<li> A DUA Cache to improve performances when accessing remote DSAs,
<li> A management application for configuration of the product,
controlling the operations and managing logs and traces,
<li> A user application for the manipulations of the database entries.
</ul>
<p>

The X500-DS package contains:
<p>
<ul>
<li> All components of the X500-DUA,
<li> A core DSA to process all requests received from distant DUAs
through DAP protocol or from distant DSAs through DSP protocol.
It supports the referral, chained and multi-casting modes of
operation, access control lists, simple authentication,
management of knowledge information (for distribution, shadows and
copies of sub-trees),
<li> A management application for managing the schema information
(creation, deletion and modification of object classes and of
attribute types, management of the rules of the DIT),
<li> A C-ISAM database.
</ul>
<p>

COMPLIANCE (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)
<p>

Compliant with EWOS and OIW Agreements
<p>

Strong authentication in X.509 is not yet implemented. (Password
scheme is currently used.)
<p>

Consists of both DUA and DSA implementation according to the 88 CCITT
X.500 and ISO 9594 standard. The X/Open standard XDS and XOM
interface libraries are also provided.  When the product is installed
with the DCE environment, XDS and XOM interfaces are also used to
access DCE/CDS (Local Cell Directory Service) transparently. A GDA
(Global Directory Agent) serves then as the gateway between the DCE
CDS and GDS.
<p>

It is planned to support full 1992 extensions in the products for
1995.

<p>

<dl>
<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>The implementation consists of a set DUA library routines, a terminal
interface, and a DSA. The implementation was developed in C on Sun
SPARCstations under SunOS 4.1.1. All underlying services are provided
by the ISODE development package. The development package is also
used for encoding and decoding ASN.1 data as well as for other data
manipulation services. Using the ISODE package the implementation can
be run over both TCP/IP and OSI protocols.
</dl>
<p>

The DSA provides full support for both DAP and DSP protocols,
conformant with ISO 9594 / CCITT X.500 standards. The DIB is
maintained using a locally developed relational database system. The
interface to the database system consists of a set of sql-like C
functions.  These are designed to allow straightforward replacement
of the local database system with a more powerful commercial system.
To achieve better performance several options are supported that
permit loading of selected portions of the database in core. When
these options are selected data can be retrieved more quickly from in
core tables; all modifications to the DIB are directly reflected in
the in core tables and the database.
<p>

COMPLIANCE (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)
<p>

Custos is fully compliant with the 1988 Standard with the following
omissions:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Search request decomposition
<li> Modify Entry operation
<li> Modify RDN operation
<li> Abandon operation
<li> Strong Authentication
<li> Schema checking
</ul>

INTEROPERABILITY
<p>

<p>

BUGS
<p>

Bugs may be reported to the general discussion list,
x500@osi.ncsl.nist.gov.
<p>

CAVEATS and GENERAL LIMITATIONS
<p>

No limitations on file sizes, etc. The only side effects to creating
large files should be in the area of performance. Specifically,
optimization requires loading parts of the DIB in core so greater
memory requirements will be necessary for achieving better
performance with a large database. Any platform the implementation
can be ported to (generally any platform ISODE can be ported to)
should support all features.
<p>

INTERNETWORKING ENVIRONMENT
<p>

RFC-1006; TP4/CLNP (SunLinkOSI) over 802 and X.25 (SunLink X.25).
<p>

HARDWARE PLATFORMS
<p>

It's only been run on Sun 3 and SPARC, but there are no known reasons
why it shouldn't run on any hardware running the ISODE software.
<p>

SOFTWARE PLATFORMS
<p>

It requires UNIX and the ISODE software package. It's been developed
and tested with ISODE version 7.0 and Sun OS version 4.1.1. Uses a
locally developed relational DBMS that should be easily replaceable
with commercially available relational systems.
<p>

AVAILABILITY
<p>

Custos, the NIST implementation of X.500, the OSI Directory, is
available for anonymous ftp from osi.ncsl.nist.gov (129.6.48.100)
using the convention (user name = anonymous, password = ident). The
software is available in two forms: a tar file and a compressed tar
file.
<p>
<pre>
./pub/directory/CustosRel_0.2.tar
./pub/directory/CustosRel_0.2.tar.Z
</pre>
<p>

Note: permissions on the directory ./pub/directory are set so that
you will be able to "get" files whose names you can provide. However,
you will not be able to "ls" the contents of the directory.

<dl>
<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>DE (Directory Enquiries) is intended to be a simple-to-use DUA
interface, suitable for the naive user, and suitable for running as a
public access dua.  it will work on any terminal.  The user is
presented with a series of (verbose) prompts asking for person's
name; department; organization; country.  There is extensive on-line
help.  The matching algorithms are such that near matches are
presented to the user before less good matches.
<p>

A lot of development has been done on the interface since it was
first described in RFC1292. The most significant enhancement has
been to add power searching - this allows a user to search for an
entry even when they do not know the name of the organisation in
which the person works - you still have to specify the country.  DE
now provides UFN style searching.  It is now possible to search
locality entries.  DE now uses slightly different search algorithms
depending on whether it is accessing part of the Directory mastered
by a Quipu DSA - Quipu DSAs tend to use lots of replication and so
encourage searching.  An experimental feature is intended to give the
user more feedback on the likely response time to a query - DE
maintains a database of past information availability and DSA
responsiveness.  Translations exist into at least 4 different
languages.
<p>

DE runs over ISODE DAP and University of Michigan LDAP.  There is a
version of DE, called DOS-DE, which has been ported to DOS, and this
uses LDAP.
<p>

DE was funded by the COSINE PARADISE project, and DE is used as the
PARADISE public access dua. You can test the software by telnet to
128.86.8.56 and logging in as dua -- no password required.

<dl>
<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>Directory 500 (D500) is a comprehensive implementation of the CCITT
X.500 recommendations. D500 is comprised of two major components
which are responsible for manipulating the data in the OSI Directory.
They are the Directory User Agent (DUA) and the Directory System
Agent (DSA).
</dl>
<p>

The DUA is the interface between the OSI Directory and those users
wishing access to the Directory's information. Users make their
requests through the DUA. When forwarding user's requests to the OSI
Directory, the protocol used is known as the Directory Access
Protocol (DAP).
<p>

The DSA will negotiate with other, remote DSAs to obtain requested
information or to update remote DIBs. DSAs use the Directory System
Protocol (DSP) to forward and answer these requests. The DSA supports
chaining and referrals.
<p>

COMPLIANCE (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)
<p>

All X.500 1988 operations are supported along with all Object Classes
specified in X.521 and all Attribute Types specified in X.520.
<p>

Implementation plans include upgrades to support the 1992 extensions
to X.500 in 1994. Please check with OSIware / Infonet Software
Solutions for availability dates.

<dl>
<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>DOS-DE (DOS Directory Enquiries) is intended to be a simple-to-use
DUA interface suitable for the naive user.  It is an MS-DOS port of
the standard UNIX DE implementation - see the entry on DE for full
details.  (All of the features DE are supported apart from the
experimental `Quality of Service' code).
</dl>
<p>

The user is presented with a series of (verbose) prompts asking for
person's name; department; organization; country.  There is extensive
on-line help.  The matching algorithms are such that near matches are
presented to the user before less good matches.  `Power searching' is
also available - this allows a user to search for an entry even when
they do not know the name of the organisation in which the person
works - you still have to specify the country.  DOS-DE provides UFN
style searching.  It is also possible to search locality entries.
DOS-DE uses slightly different search algorithms depending on whether
it is accessing part of the Directory mastered by a Quipu DSA - Quipu
DSAs tend to use lots of replication and so encourage searching.
<p>

DOS-DE runs over the University of Michigan LDAP.
<p>

DE was funded by the COSINE PARADISE project.  DOS-DE was developed
by Andy Powell at the University of Bath.

DOS-DE tries to cater well for the general case, at the expense of
not dealing with the less typical.  The main manifestation of this is
that the current version does not handle searching under localities
very well.

<dd>HP X.500 Distributed Directory. Its main components are:
</dl>
<p>

DUA, and DUA Interface,
<br>DSA and DIB support,
<br>X.500 Address Lookup,
<br>X/Open Application Tool Kit API (XAT) for XDS/XOM Interface,

<br>X.500 High Level API (X5HLAPI) for XDS/XOM Interface.
<p>

HP X.500 Distributed Directory is based on the 1988 CCITT X.500
standard.  HP X.500 can be used for accessing names and electronic
mail addresses for multi-vendor messaging backbone networks. HP X.500
can also be used for the development of networked applications
requiring distributed directory functionality.
<p>

HP OpenMail users can access the enterprise wide HP X.500 distributed
directory directly from the HP OpenMail user interface, and select
X.500 addresses for mailing. HP-UX Sendmail users can access
electronic mail addresses from a X.500 server over a TCP/IP network.
<p>

Users of non-HP e-mail systems can access data stored in the X.500
Directory using X.500 Address Look-up. X.500 Address Look-up has an
easy to use interface, and phonetic search capability.
<p>

HP X.500 Distributed Directory includes a complete multi-threaded DUA
and DSA. The X.500 DIB is built on a database which has been
optimized for X.500 performance. HP X.500 contains full support for
DAP and DSP protocols.
<p>

Data Shadowing and security access control of HP X.500 Distributed
Directory allow higher performance, and easier management of its DIB
database in a global environment.
<p>

HP X.500 Distributed Directory has menu driven administration and
user interface tools. The tools simplify directory configuration and
data retrieval. It supports X/Open X.500 APIs (XDS and XOM), and high
level APIs on top of XDS to allow developers to write their own X.500
based applications.
<p>

HP X.500 Distributed Directory supports comprehensive tracing and
logging facilities for quick diagnosis and resolution of problems. HP
also provides a rich set of troubleshooting tools to check the
interoperability of the network at various layers of the OSI stack.
<p>

COMPLIANCE (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)
<p>

HP X.500 Distributed Directory complies with the following standards:
<p>
<br>CCITT X.501:  The Directory - Models
<br>CCITT X.509:  The Directory - Authentications Framework*
<br>CCITT X.511:  The Directory - Abstract Service Definition
<br>CCITT X.518:  The Directory - Procedures for Distributed Operations
<br>CCITT X.519:  The Directory - Protocol Specifications
<br>CCITT X.520:  The Directory - Selected Attribute Types
<br>CCITT X.521:  The Directory - Selected Object Classes
<br>CCITT X.219:  Remote Operations - Model, Notation and Service Definition
<br>CCITT X.229:  Remote Operations - Protocol Specifications
<p>

*x.509 describes simple and strong authentication. HP X.500
Distributed Directory supports simple authentication. Strong
authentication is not supported in the current release due to
limited market demand.
<p>

HP X.500 Distributed Directory will comply with NIST and EWOS
directory functional profiles. Based on factors such as market needs
and NIST recommendations, HP will implement subsets of 1992 CCITT
functionality in a phased approach.

<dl>
<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>LDAP is the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.  It gives X.500
access to platforms that have only TCP/IP access, using simplified
BER encoding of many X.500 data elements.  LDAP is currently a
proposed Internet Standard. The LDAP server is an intermediate
protocol server that communicates with Internet clients on one side
using the simple TCP-based LDAP protocol and an X.500 DSA on the
other side using the Directory Access Protocol (DAP).  A subset of
the X.500 DAP is exported to the clients through the LDAP protocol.
</dl>
<p>

The U-M LDAP distribution contains the following components:
<p>
<ul>
<li> LDAP server
<li> LDAP client library, including both synchronous and asynchronous APIs
<li> Lightweight BER library, including an API that supports
a printf/scanf-like interface
<li> Various LDAP client programs, including a finger daemon (xfingerd),
gopher to X.500 gateway (go500gw), command-line DUA (ud), e-mail
query server (rcpt500), and an X.500 mailer (mail500)
</ul>
<p>


COMPLIANCE (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)
<p>

The U-M LDAP distribution is a complete implementation of the LDAP
protocol.  The LDAP protocol does not support access to all X.500
features and operations.  The operations supported are bind, search,
compare, add, delete, modify, modify RDN, and abandon.  Note that
read and list operations can be emulated using the search operation.
Size and time limits may be specified, as may alias dereferencing and
searching, but all X.500 service controls are not supported.
<p>

CONFORMANCE WITH PROPOSED INTERNET STANDARDS
<p>

<p>

CONSISTENCE WITH INFORMATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RFCs
<p>

Preliminary support is included for [RFC 1484].
<p>

INTEROPERABILITY
<p>

The current implementation of the LDAP server is known to work with
the QUIPU DSA and DAP library.
<p>

PILOT CONNECTIVITY
<p>

DUA connectivity should be possible to all pilots, though only
AARNET, PARADISE, and PSI White Pages Project have actually been
tried.
<p>

BUGS
<p>

Bug reports should be sent to bug-ldap@umich.edu.
<p>

CAVEATS and GENERAL LIMITATIONS
<p>

None, aside from those mentioned above under completeness.
<p>

INTERNETWORKING ENVIRONMENT
<p>

LDAP clients use TCP to communicate with the LDAP server.  The LDAP
server normally uses RFC 1006 with TCP/IP to communicate with the
DSA, though any other transport mechanism for DSA communication
supported by ISODE should be possible.
<p>

HARDWARE PLATFORMS
<p>

The LDAP server is known to run on Sun 3 and Sun 4 platforms DEC's,
HP's, and RS 6000's.  The LDAP client libraries and some clients have
been ported to the Macintosh and the PC.
<p>

SOFTWARE PLATFORMS
<p>

The LDAP server and clients are known to run under and SunOS 4.1.x,
ULTRIX, HP-UX, and AIX.  The LDAP client libraries also work under
Macintosh System 6.0 or higher and MS-DOS 5.0.
<p>

AVAILABILITY
<p>

This software is openly available.  It may be obtained by anonymous
FTP from terminator.rs.itd.umich.edu in the x500 directory.
Documentation on the LDAP and lightweight BER libraries is provided

<dl>
<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>maX.500 is a Directory User Agent for Apple Macintosh.  It is
currently at version 2.0, which uses the Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol (LDAP) over TCP/IP to access The Directory.  maX.500 can be
used to search for, view, create, delete, and modify entries.  It
supports viewing of textual information, playing of audio, and
viewing of black and white (fax) and color (JPEG) images.
</dl>
<p>

maX.500 is a native Macintosh application, and as such has a friendly
interface.  It requires System Software version 6.0.5 or later and
Apple's MacTCP control panel.
<p>

COMPLIANCE (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)
<p>

maX.500 works over LDAP, and is subject to LDAP's limitations.  The
X.500 bind, search, compare, add, delete, abandon, and modify
operations are used by maX.500.  Size and time limits may be
specified, as may alias dereferencing and searching.
<p>

CONFORMANCE WITH PROPOSED INTERNET STANDARDS
<p>

Compliant with [RFC 1485], [RFC 1487], and [RFC 1274].
<p>

CONSISTENCE WITH INFORMATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RFCs
<p>

Preliminary support is included for [RFC 1484] (same as U-M LDAP).
<p>

INTEROPERABILITY
<p>

maX.500 2.0 is known to work with the U-M LDAP server.  It has been
used successfully with the QUIPU DSA and others.
<p>

PILOT CONNECTIVITY
<p>

DUA connectivity should be possible to all pilots, though only
AARNET, PARADISE, and PSI White Pages Project have actually been
tried.
<p>

BUGS
<p>

Bug reports should be sent to max500-bugs@umich.edu.
<p>

CAVEATS and GENERAL LIMITATIONS
<p>

or "audio" attributes.  Modify RDN is also unsupported.
<p>

INTERNETWORKING ENVIRONMENT
<p>

maX.500 is an LDAP client, and as such is uses TCP to communicate
with the  LDAP server.  Apple's MacTCP control panel is required on
the Macintosh.
<p>

HARDWARE PLATFORMS
<p>

maX.500 runs on Apple Macintosh Plus or later computers.  It requires
1MB of RAM.
<p>

SOFTWARE PLATFORMS

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>This implementation is a source release derived from the earlier
openly available version of QUIPU, and will be used as base
technology for products by a number of vendors. The release comprises
of a DSA, and a number of sample DUAs which may be used in
conjunction with the DSA.
</dl>
<p>

COMPLIANCE (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)
<p>

The DSA is aligned to the 1988 ISO IS and the NIST OIW Directory
Implementors Guide Version 1, with the following exceptions:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Strong authentication is not implemented (but hooks are
provided for use with two packages).
<li> QUIPU does not enforce the bounds constraints on attributes,
filters or APDU size.
<li> T.61 string formatting characters are not rejected.
<li> If a DN is supplied with no password in an unprotected simple bind,
QUIPU does not always check to see if the DN exists. If the DSA
connected to can say authoritatively the DN does not exist, the
association is rejected. However, if a chain operation is required
to check the DN, the bind IS allowed.
<li> When comparing attributes of UTCtime syntax, if the seconds field
is omitted, QUIPU does not perform the match correctly (i.e., the
seconds field in the attribute values should be ignored, but are
not).
<li> QUIPU always supplies the optional Chaining argument
"originator" even if the CommonArgument "requestor" is used.
<li> QUIPU always supplies the optional Chaining argument "target"
even if the base object in the DAP arguments is the same.
<li> The object class "without an assigned object identifier" is
not recognised unless the "alias" object class is also present.
<li> Non Specific Subordinate References are never followed by a QUIPU
DSA, but they are passed on correctly to the client if generated.
</ul>
<p>

Compliance with X.500(1993) standards is planned. DAP and replication
(DISP) will be available in March 1994. Other 1993 features, with the
exception of DOB, but including security features will be available.

<dl>
<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>The Traxis Enterprise Directory has multiple components in a three
layer architecture. The individual components of the Traxis family
are building blocks which can be assembled in a flexible, modular way
to build complex systems.
</dl>
<p>

At the enterprise level, is a distributed directory stored and
managed by Traxis Directory Engines (TDEs). At the workgroup level
Traxis Directory Hubs (TDHs) provide the means to integrate and
connect Traxis Directory Engines to the wide variety of real world
applications and systems which prevail in network environments. The
TDE and the TDH support the myriad of client applications, including
messaging and business applications, which require services from the
Traxis directory.
<p>

At the desktop level, the Traxis Desktop Client (TDC) provides a
common set of facilities which simplify and enable communications,
object manipulation, and results management as required between the
Traxis Directory Hub and applications. These capabilities, which
include full access and management of the directory, are provided to
applications through XDS++, the Traxis object oriented API. The
Traxis Desktop Client also supports industry standard client software
interfaces such as Microsoft MAPI, Apple OCE, CMC and VIM, through
Compatibility Modules which map the standard API into XDS++. Through
these APIs the Traxis Desktop Client supports applications of all
kinds on PC, Macintosh, and UNIX systems.
<p>

Angeli supplied Traxis applications include the Traxis Administrative
Console management station, the Traxis Global Browser general
directory tool, the Traxis Operator Assistance high-speed look-up,
the Traxis Data Base Gateway, the Traxis Import Export Utility and
more.
<p>

The Traxis Directory Engine includes an X.500 DSA. The Traxis
Directory Hub includes an X.500 DUA.
<p>

COMPLIANCE (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)
<p>

Traxis Directory Engine DSA is CCITT-1988 compliant with extended
security and access control. Supports access control on User, Entry,
and Attribute levels. DIB or subtree administrative manager
supported. Supports simple authentication with encrypted password.
<p>

NIST OIW Stable Implementation Agreements [NIST-88] compliant.
<p>

Support for February 14, 1993 CCITT X.500 planned. X.509 in first
half of 1994. Replication and Administrative/Information Model in
second half of 1994.
<p>

CONFORMANCE WITH PROPOSED INTERNET STANDARDS
<p>

Traxis conforms to RFC1274 which documents COSINE interoperability.
<p>

LDAP (RFC 1487) is planned for inclusion in a later release of Traxis
if market demand requires it.
<p>

CONSISTENCE WITH INFORMATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RFCs
<p>

Traxis does not conform to the QUIPU RFC Internet Proposals cited.
As noted elsewhere, Traxis is fully compatible with QUIPU
operationally but does not use the cited RFCs in its internal
operations.
<p>

INTEROPERABILITY

<dl>
<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>UCOM.X 500 includes a Directory System Agent (DSA), various directory
access APIs and Directory User Agents (DUAs). UCOM.X 500 is a product
based on PIZARRO, the research prototype developed at INRIA by
Christian Huitema's team, and commercialized by TS-E3X, a member of
the France Telecom group.
</dl>
<p>

Characteristics of the DSA are:
<p>
<ul>
<li> The DAP and DSP protocols are provided conformant with X.500 (88).
<li> The DIB is maintained in ASN.1 encoded format in the Unix file
system.  Utilities are provided to load and dump the DIB from and
to ASCII text files.
<li> The DIT structure is held in main memory. Frequently used attributes
may be held in inverted tables in memory to speed up searches.
<li> Knowledge management: knowledge on managed domains is stored in
UCOM.X specific attributes of the DSA entries.
<li> Schema: The X.500 (88), X.400 (88) and most of the Cosine and
Internet Schema are supported. Object class and attribute
definitions are enforced. Users may define their own.
<li> Simple authentication is provided; strong authentication and
signed operations are being tested operationally through TS-E3X's
participation in PASSWORD, a VALUE project with aim to pilot a
European security infrastructure for network applications.
<li> Access control: private mechanisms are provided to allow access
control lists to be specified for parts of the DIT, to control
modifications, and to specify access restrictions on attributes.
<li> Management: a UCOM.X DSA object has been defined to allow
operational parameters of the DSA to be managed via DAP.
Administration utilities are provided to, e.g., generate usage
statistics and periodically update the database from various data
sources including a knowledge discovery tool.
</ul>
<p>


The product offers a C language API conformant to X/Open's X/DS
specification, and a C++ API (for release 10/93).
<p>

The DUAs include a graphical directory browser with powerful search
functionality for OpenLook and Motif, and a full-screen curses-based
interface with full DAP functionality.
<p>

TS-E3X's strategy for UCOM.X500 is three-fold: Firstly, to use it as
the directory service for Spheris, France Telecom's range of
electronic mail products based on X.400 (88) (release mid '94).
Secondly, to offer it to third parties developing specific
applications using X.500: current applications include a distributed
application to control document transfer in a large French hospital
and distributed applications management in the French Post Office;
planned uses include office applications for control of document
circulation (workflow) and cooperative document editing. Thirdly, to
offer it to telecomms operators such as France Telecom for
application in network management. UCOM.X 500 is used extensively by
French research centers involved in PARADISE.
<p>

COMPLIANCE (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)
<p>

UCOM.X 500 conforms to X.500 (88) as specified in paragraph 9 of
X.519.
<p>

Development of the product based on X.500 (93) is planned for '94
with release of a product conformant to the principal extensions at
the end of '94. Emphasis is being placed on the shadowing protocol,
the schema and access control.
<p>

CONFORMANCE WITH PROPOSED INTERNET STANDARDS
<p>

The COSINE and Internet Schema (RFC 1274) is supported with minor
exceptions.
<p>

The string representation of PSAPs and their internal encoding
conforms to RFC 1277.
<p>

The string representation of DNs will migrate to the Internet RFC
1485 definition.
<p>

CONSISTENCE WITH INFORMATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RFCs
<p>

RFC 1279 (X.500 and Domains) is supported. The string representation
of PSAPs and their internal encoding conforms to RFC 1278.
<p>

AFRO (algorithme francais de recherche optimise), the search / name
resolution algorithm proposed by UCOM.X 500, differs from the UFN
algorithm principally in that it attempts to optimize by performing
read operations before resorting to searches in order to exploit the
name error information.
<p>

INTEROPERABILITY
<p>

Through UCOM.X 500's use in the French PARADISE pilot,
interoperability has been informally but extensively tested with
Quipu and other implementations.
<p>

Detailed interoperability tests  with Quipu, Marben and  Siemens/Bull
DIR/X are being conducted by  the PARADISE OIFP (Operational
Interworking) team at INRIA Rocquencourt, France.
<p>

The product is currently also undergoing  formal tests for
conformance to the CTS2  DSA/DAP and  ACSE/Presentation/Session
specifications  at the  French OSI conformance test centre.
<p>


PILOT CONNECTIVITY
<p>

DSA and DUA connectivity to the PARADISE pilot.
<p>

BUGS
<p>

UCOM.X 500 is a commercial product. As such, it is supported and bugs
are fixed when detected. Bug reports can be sent to our support team
via electronic mail.
<p>

CAVEATS AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS
<p>

The DIT structure and inverted attribute tables are stored in main
memory. The recommended main memory size for a DSA is 1 kb per node,
i.e., 10 Mb for a database of 10,000 objects. The current recommended
maximum is a database size of the order of 100,000 objects.
<p>

Of the selected attribute types defined in X.500 (88), the
searchGuide attribute is not supported ; neither are the following
attributes from the Cosine and Internet Schema (RFC 1274):
OtherMailbox, MailPreferenceOption and the various quality
attributes.
<p>

The X/DS API supports the Basic Directory Contents (BDCP), the MHS
Directory User (MDUP) and the Strong Authentication (SAP) packages
with minor limitations. A proprietary mechanism for defining new
classes and attributes is offered. Asynchronous operations and
multiple concurrent sessions are not supported. Whilst referral may
be handled automatically, continuation references are not.
<p>

INTERNETWORKING ENVIRONMENT
<p>

UCOM.X 500 includes a transport stack for TP0 with TCP/IP (RFC 1006)
and X.25.  The stack has been ported to SunNet OSI for TP4 with CLNP.
<p>

HARDWARE PLATFORMS
<p>

UCOM.X 500 can easily be ported to any UNIX machine. It currently
runs on: Sun 3 and 4, IBM RS 6000, DEC ULTRIX (Vax and Mips), 386-
based PCs, Bull DPX/2 and DPX/20, Sequent, Tandem and others.
<p>

SOFTWARE PLATFORMS
<p>

UCOM.X 500 is portable to any UNIX-like operating system. It has been
ported to: UNIX SVR3 and SVR4, SUN OS 4, AIX, SCO Unix, Interactive
Unix, ULTRIX, HP-UX, Dynix (Sequent), BOS (Bull) and others.
<p>

Ports to the following are planned: OS/2 ('94), Windows 3 ('94).
<p>

The product does not make use of an external DBMS for the information
base.

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>Xdi is a Directory User Agent (DUA) for the X Window System.  In
addition to providing a user-friendly interface, it supports
Directory interactions of different levels of complexity. Users can
select different window screens to browse, search and modify the
Directory.  There are two different search screens for name based
search and attribute based search. It is simple to use for novice
users but is also useful for more advanced users to formulate complex
search filters.  Xdi also supports "user-friendly naming" in many
cases so that users are not required to know X.500 naming format.
