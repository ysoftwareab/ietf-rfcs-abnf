<h3>Status of this Memo</h3></a>
<p>

This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does
not specify an Internet standard.  Distribution of this memo is
unlimited.
<p>
<a name="abstract">
<h3>Abstract</h3></a>
<p>

The goal of this FYI memo is to provide an update to FYI 2, RFC 1147
[1], which provided practical information to site administrators and
network managers.  New and/or updated tools are listed in this RFC.
Additonal descriptions are welcome, and should be sent to: noctools-
entries@merit.edu.
<p>
<a name="intro">
<h3>Introduction</h3></a>
<p>

A static document cannot incorporate references to the latest tools
nor recent revisions to the older catalog entries.  To provide a more
timely and responsive information source, the NOCtools catalog is
available on-line via the Internet and Usenet.
<p>

<br>news    comp.networks.noctools
<br>ftp     wuarchive.wustl.edu:/doc/noctools
<p>

Because of publication delays and other factors, some of the entries
in this catalog may be out of date.  The reader is urged to consult
the on-line service to obtain the most up-to-date information.
<p>

The index provided in this document reflects the current contents of
the on-line documentation.
<p>

The NOCtools2 Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF) has compiled this revised catalog.  Future revisions will be
incorporated into the on-line NOCtools catalog.  The reader is
encouraged to submit new or revised entries for (near-immediate)
electronic publication.
<p>


The tools described in this catalog are in no way endorsed by the
IETF.  For the most part, we have neither evaluated the tools in this
catalog, nor validated their descriptions.  Most of the descriptions
of commercial tools have been provided by vendors.  Caveat Emptor.

<h3>"No-Writeups" Appendix</h3></a></a>
<p>

This section contains references to tools which are known to exist,
but which have not been fully cataloged.  If anyone wishes to author
an entry for one of these tools please contact us at:
<p>

noctools-request@merit.edu
<p>

Keep in mind that if these or other tools are included in the future,
they will be available in the on-line version of the catalog.
<p>

Each mention is separated by a  &lt form-feed &gt  for improved readability.
If you intend to actually print-out this section of the catalog, then
you should probably strip-out the  &lt ff &gt .

<dt>Keywords
<p>

<dd>This catalog uses "keywords" for terse characterizations of the
tools.  Keywords are abbreviated attributes of a tool or its use.  To
allow cross-comparison of tools, uniform keyword definitions have
been developed, and are given below.  Following the definitions,
there is an index of catalog entries by keyword.
<p>

<dt>Keyword Definitions
<p>

<dd>The keywords are always listed in a prefined order, sorted first by
the general category into which they fall, and then alphabetically.
The categories that have been defined for management tool keywords
are:
<p>
<ul>

<li>    the general management area to which a tool
relates or a tool's functional role;
<p>

<li>    the network resources or components that are managed;
<p>

<li>    the mechanisms or methods a tool uses to perform its functions;
<p>

<li>    the operating system and hardware environment of a tool; and

Tool Descriptions
<p>

This section is an updated collection of brief descriptions of tools
for managing TCP/IP internets.  These entries are in alphabetical
order, by tool name.
<p>

The entries all follow a standard format.  Immediately after the NAME
of a tool are its associated KEYWORDS.  Keywords are terse
descriptions of the purposes or attributes of a tool.  A more
detailed description of a tool's purpose and characteristics is given
in the ABSTRACT section.  The MECHANISM section describes how a tool
works.  In CAVEATS, warnings about tool use are given.  In BUGS,
known bugs or bug-report procedures are given.  LIMITATIONS describes
the boundaries of a tool's capabilities.  HARDWARE REQUIRED and
SOFTWARE REQUIRED relate the operational environment a tool needs.
Finally, in AVAILABILITY, pointers to vendors, online repositories,
or other sources for a tool are given.
<p>

Where tool names conflict, the vendor name is used as well.  For
example, MITRE, and SNMP Research each submitted an updated
description of a tool called, "NETMON".  These tools were
independently developed, are functionally different, and run in
different environments.  MITRE's tool is listed as "NETMON_MITRE,"
and the tool from SNMP Research as "NETMON_WINDOWS_SNMP_RESEARCH".

<p>
<dl>

<dt>NAME
<dd>ChameLAN 100
<p>

<dt>KEYWORDS
<dd>analyzer, benchmark, debugger, generator, map,
reference, status, traffic; bridge, DECnet, ethernet,
FDDI, IP, OSI, NFS, ring; eavesdrop, SNMP, X;
standalone, UNIX.
<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>Tekelec's ChameLAN 100 is a portable diagnostic system
for monitoring and simulation of FDDI, Ethernet and
Token Ring networks -- simultaneously.  Protocol
analysis of multiple topologies, as well as mixed
topoloies simultaneously, is a key feature of
the product family.  Tekelec's proprietary FDDI
hardware guarantees complete real-time analysis of
networks and network components at the full ring
bandwidth of 125 Mbps.  It passively connects to the
network and captures 100 percent of the data, measures
performance and isolates real-time problems.
<p>

The simulation option offers full bandwidth load
generation that allows you to create and simulate any
network condition.  It gives you the ability to inject
errors and misformed frames.  A set of
confidence tests allow simple evaluation of new
equipment.  A ring map feature displays network
topology and status of all nodes via the SMT
process.
<p>

Monitoring of FDDI, Ethernet and Token Ring allows the
user to: view network status in real time; view
network, node, or node pair statistics; capture
frames; control capture using trigger and filter
capabilities; view real-time statistics; view captured
frames in decoded format; and view the last frame
transmitted by each station.
<p>

The following Real-Time Network Statistics of FDDI,
Ethernet and Token Ring networks is displayed: frame
rate, runts, byte rate, jabbers, CRC/align errors, and
collisions.
<p>

Product developers can use the ChameLAN 100 to observe
and control various events to help debug their FDDI,
Ethernet and Token Ring products.  End users can
perform real-time monitoring to test and
diagnose problems that may occur when developing,
installing or managing FDDI, Ethernet and Token Ring
networks and network products.  End users can use the
ChameLAN 100 to aid in the installation and
maintenance of Ethernet and Token Ring networks.  To
isolate specific network trouble spots the ChameLAN
100 uses filtering and triggering techniques for data
capture.  Higher level protocol decode includes
TCP/IP, OSI and DECnet protocol suites.  Protocol
decode of IPX, SNMP, XTP, and AppleTalk are also
supported.  Development of additional protocol decodes
is also under development.  The ChameLAN 100 family
also offers a Protocol Management Development System
(PMDS) that enables users to develop custom protocol
decode suites.
<p>

The FDDI, Ethernet and Token Ring hardware interfaces
feature independent processing power.  Real-time data
is monitored unobtrusively at full bandwidth without
affecting network activity.  Real-time data may also
be saved to a 120MB or optional 200MB hard disk drive
for later analysis.  FDDI data is captured at 125 megabits
per second (Mbps), Ethernet at 10 Mbps and Token Ring
at 4 or 16 Mbps.
<p>

<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>This portable, standalone unit incorporates the power
of UNIX, X-Windows and Motif.  Its UNIX-based
programming interface facilitates development of
customized monitoring and simulation applications.  The
ChameLAN 100 may connect to the network at any
location using standard equipment.  Standard graphical
Motif/X-Windows and TCP/IP allow remote control
through Ethernet and 10Base T interfaces.  Tekelec
also offers a rackmounted model -- ChameLAN 100-X.
Both models can be controlled via a Sun Workstation
remotely.
<p>

<dt>CAVEATS
<dd>none.
<p>

<dt>BUGS
<dd>none known.
<p>

<dt>LIMITATIONS
<dd>none reported.
<p>

<dt>HARDWARE REQUIRED
<dd>None.  The ChameLAN 100 is a self-contained unit, and
includes its own interface cards.  It installs
into a network with standard interface
connectors.
<p>

<dt>SOFTWARE REQUIRED
<dd>None.

<dt>KEYWORDS
<dd>security; DOS.
<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>This program consists of 858 computer security ques-
tions divided up in thirteen sections.  The program
presents the questions to the user and records their
responses.  After answering the questions in one of the
thirteen sections, the user can generate a report from
the questions and the user's answers.  The thirteen
sections are: telecommunications security, physical
access security, personnel security, systems develop
ment security, security awareness and training prac
tices, organizational and management security, data and
program security, processing and operations security,
ergonomics and error prevention, environmental secu
rity, and backup and recovery security.
<p>

The questions are weighted as to their importance, and
the report generator can sort the questions by weight.
This way the most important issues can be tackled
first.
<p>

<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>The questions are displayed on the screen and the user
is prompted for a single keystroke reply.  When the end
of one of the thirteen sections is reached, the answers
are written to a disk file.  The question file and the
answer file are merged to create the report file.

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>These commands display private MIB information from
Wellfleet systems.  They retrieve and format for
display values of one or several MIB variables from the
Wellfleet Communications private enterprise MIB, using
the SNMP (RFC1098).  In particular these tools are used
to examine the non-IP modules (DECnet, XNS, and Bridg
ing) of a Wellfleet system.
<p>

Decaddrs displays the DECnet configuration of a
Wellfleet system acting as a DECnet router, showing the
static parameters associated with each DECnet inter
face.  Decaroute and decnroute display the DECnet
inter-area and intra-area routing tables (that is area
routes and node routes).  Xnsroutes displays routes
known to a Wellfleet system acting as an XNS router.
Bridgetab displays the bridge forwarding table with the
disposition of traffic arriving from or directed to
each station known to the Wellfleet bridge module.  All
these commands take an IP address as the argument and
can specify an SNMP community for the retrieval.  One
SNMP query is performed for each row of the table.
Note that the Wellfleet system must be operating as an
IP router for the SNMP to be accessible.

from SNMP Research.
<p>

<dt>KEYWORDS
<dd>alarm, control, manager, reference, security, status;
bridge, Ethernet, FDDI, IP, OSI, ring, star;
NMS, SNMP;
sourcelib.
<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>The EMANATE system provides a run-time extensible SNMP
agent that dynamically reconfigures an agent's MIB
without having to recompile, relink, or restart the
agent.  An EMANATE capable SNMP agent can support zero,
one, or many subagents and dynamically reconfigure to
connect or disconnect those subagents' MIBs.
<p>

The EMANATE system consists of several logically
independent components and subsystems:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Master SNMP agent which contains an API to communicate
with subagents.
<li> Subagents which implement various MIBS.
<li> Subagent Developer's Kit which contains tools to assist
in the implementation of subagents.
<li> EMANATE libraries which provide the API for the
subagent.
<p>

<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>A concise API allows a standard means of communication
between the master and subagents.  System dependent
mechanisms are employed for transfer of information
between the master and subagents.
<p>

<dt>NAME
<dd>etherfind
<p>

<dt>KEYWORDS
<dd>traffic; ethernet, IP, NFS; eavesdrop; UNIX.
<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>Etherfind examines the packets that traverse a network
interface, and outputs a text file describing the
traffic.  In the file, a single line of text describes
a single packet: it contains values such as protocol
type, length, source, and destination.  Etherfind can
print out all packet traffic on the ethernet, or
traffic for the local host.  Further packet filtering
can be done on the basis of protocol: IP, ARP, RARP,
ICMP, UDP, ND, TCP, and filtering can also be done
based on the source, destination addresses as well as
TCP and UDP port numbers.
<p>

<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>In usual operations, and by default, etherfind puts the
interface in promiscuous mode.  In 4.3BSD UNIX and
related OSs, it uses a Network Interface Tap (NIT) to
obtain a copy of traffic on an ethernet interface.
<p>

<dt>CAVEATS

<p>

<dt>KEYWORDS
<dd>manager; osi; cmis; unix; free, sourcelib
<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>The Generic Managed System (GMS) implements the
functions that would be common to any OSI managed
system. These include the parseing of CMIS requests,
selection of managed objects according to the scoping
and filtering rules, handling of notifications and
event forwarding discriminators etc. The intention is
that the implementors should use the GMS as a basis
for their own managed object implementations. A
support environment is provided to assist with this.
<p>

<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>The GMS uses the UCL CMIP library plus a library of
C++ objects representing common managed objects and
attribute types.
<p>

<dt>CAVEATS
<dd>The system is still experimental, is subject to change
and is not yet well documented.

<dt>NAME
<dd>getethers
<p>

<dt>KEYWORDS
<dd>Traffic; Ethernet; Ping; UNIX; Free
<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>Getethers runs through all addresses on an ethernet
segment (a.b.c.1 to a.b.c.254) and pings each address,
and then determines the ethernet address for that
host.  It produces a list, in either plain ASCII, the
file format for the Excelan Lanalyzer, or the file
format for the Network General Sniffer, of
hostname/ethernet address pairs for all hosts on the
local nework.  The plain ASCII list optionally
includes the vendor name of the ethernet card in
each system, to aid in the determination of the
identity of unknown systems.
<p>

<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>Getethers uses a raw IP socket to generate ICMP echo
requests and receive ICMP echo replies, and then
examines the kernel ARP table to determine the
ethernet address of each responding system.
<p>

<dt>CAVEATS
<dd>Assumes that the ethernet it is looking at is either
a Class C IP network, or part of a Class B IP network
that is subnetted with a netmask of 255.255.255.0.

<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>These commands retrieve and format for display values
of one or several MIB variables (RFC1066) using the
SNMP (RFC1098).  Getone and getmany retrieve arbitrary
MIB variables; getroute, getarp, getaddr, and getif
retrieve and display tabular information (routing
tables, ARP table, interface configuration, etc.), and
getid retrieves and displays system name, identifica
tion and boot time.
<p>

Getone  &lt target &gt   &lt mibvariable &gt  retrieves and displays
the value of the designated MIB variable from the
specified target system.  The SNMP community name to be
used for the retrieval can also be specified.  Getmany
works similarly for groups of MIB variables rather than
individual values.  The name of each variable, its
value and its data type is displayed.  Getroute returns
information from the ipRoutingTable MIB structure,
displaying the retrieved information in an accessible
format.  Getarp behaves similarly for the address
translation table; getaddr for the ipAddressTable; and
getif displays information from the interfaces table,
supplemented with information from the ipAddressTable.
Getid displays the system name, identification, ipFor
warding state, and the boot time and date.  All take a
system name or IP address as an argument and can
specify an SNMP community for the retrieval.  One SNMP
query is performed for each row of the table.

radio.  Ka9q can coexist on a PC with other TCP/IP
packages such as FTP Inc's PC/TCP, but must be used
independently of other packages.  Ka9q was written by
Phil Karn.  Hopcheck was added by Katie Stevens,

<p>

<dt>KEYWORDS
<dd>status; IP, SMTP; curses, ping, spoof; UNIX; free,

<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>Internet Rover is a prototype network monitor that uses
multiple protocol "modules" to test network functional
ity.  This package consists of two primary pieces of
code: the data collector and the problem display.
<p>

There is one data collector that performs a series of
network tests, and maintains a list of problems with
the network.  There can be many display processes all
displaying the current list of problems which is useful
in a multi-operator NOC.
<p>

The display task uses curses, allowing many terminal
types to display the problem file either locally or
from a remote site.  Full source is provided.  The data
collector is easily configured and extensible.  Contri
butions such as additional protocol modules, and shell
script extensions are welcome.
<p>

<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>A configuration file contains a list of nodes,
addresses, NodeUp? protocol test (ping in most cases),
and a list of further tests to be performed if the node
is in fact up.  Modules are included to test TELNET,
FTP, and SMTP.  If the configuration contains a test
that isn't recognized, a generic test is assumed, and a
filename is checked for existence.  This way users can
create scripts that create a file if there is a prob
lem, and the data collector simply checks the existence
of that file to determine if there is problem.
<p>

<dt>CAVEATS
<dd>None.
<p>

<dt>BUGS
<dd>None known.
<p>

<dt>LIMITATIONS
<dd>This tool does not yet have the capability to  perform
actions based on the result of the test.  Rather, it is
intended for a multi-operator environment,  and  simply
displays a list of what is wrong with the net.
<p>

<dt>HARDWARE REQUIRED
<dd>This software is known to run on Suns and IBM RTs.
<p>

<dt>SOFTWARE REQUIRED
<dd>Curses, 4.xBSD UNIX socket programming  libraries,  BSD
ping.

<dt>NAME
<dd>iozone
<p>

<dt>KEYWORDS
<dd>benchmark; nfs;; dos,hp,unix,vmx; free.
<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>Software to assess the sequential file I/O capability
of a system.  May be useful as reference to compare
against results obtained when files are accessed via
NFS, Andrew, etc.
<p>

<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>This test writes a X MEGABYTE sequential file in Y
byte chunks, then rewinds it and reads it back.
[The size of the file should be big enough to factor
out the effect of any disk cache.].  Finally,
IOZONE deletes the temporary file.  Options allow one to
vary X and Y.  In addition, 'auto test' runs IOZONE
repeatedly using record sizes from 512 to 8192 bytes
(adjustable), and file sizes from 1 to 16 megabytes
(adjustable).  It creates a table of results.
<p>

<dt>CAVEATS
<dd>The file is written (filling any cache buffers), and
then read.  If the cache is  &gt = X MB, then most if not
all the reads will be satisfied from the cache.
However, if it is less than or equal to
.5X MB, then NONE of the reads will be satisfied from
the cache.  This is becase after the file is written,
a .5X MB cache will contain the upper .5 MB of the
test file, but we will start reading
from the beginning of the file (data which is no
longer in the cache).
<p>

In order for this to be a fair test, the length of the
test file must be AT LEAST 2X the amount of disk cache
memory for your system.  If not, you are really
testing the speed at which your CPU
can read blocks out of the cache (not a fair test).
<p>

<dt>BUGS
<dd>none known at this time.
<p>

<dt>LIMITATIONS
<dd>IOZONE does not normally test the raw I/O speed of
your disk or system-em.  It tests the speed of
sequential I/O to actual files.
Therefore, this measurement factors in the efficiency
of you  machines file system, operating system, C
compiler, and C runtime library.  It produces a
measurement which is the number of bytes
per second that your system can read or write to a file.

Benchmark", Bruce Nelson, LADDIS Group  &amp  Auspex Systems.
<p>

Over the past 24 months, engineers from Legato,
Auspex, Data General, DEC, Interphase, and Sun
(LADDIS) met regularly to create the LADDIS NFS
benchmark: an unbiased, standard, vendor-independent,
scalable NFS performance test.
<p>

The purpose of the LADDIS benchmark is to give users a
credible and undisputed test of NFS performance, and
to give vendors a publishable standard performance
measure that customers can use for load planning,
system configuration, and equipment buying decisions.
Toward this end, the LADDIS benchmark is being adopted
by SPEC (the System Performance Evaluation
Cooperative, creators of SPECmarks) as the first
member of SPEC's System-level File Server (SFS)
benchmark suite."
<p>

"In particular, we have had unexpected interest from
some router vendors in using LADDIS to both rate and
stress-test IP routers. This is because LADDIS can
send back-to-back full-size packet trains, and because
it can generate a 90%-Ethernet util on simulated
"real" NFS workloads, just like routers encounter in
the real world. But LADDIS is for local Ethernet or
FDDI nets only, not WAN."
<p>

<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>Generates NFS requests and measures responsiveness of
the server.
<p>

<dt>CAVEATS
<dd>"LADDIS is not released yet by SPEC, although a free
beta version, quite stable, is available now as
PRE-LADDIS. So you might want to put PRE-LADDIS in
your listing, noting that full LADDIS
availability from SPEC is expected by the end of 1992."
<p>

<dt>BUGS
<dd>The licensee is requested to direct beta test comments
via electronicmail to:
<dd>"spec-preladdis-comments@riscee.pko.dec.com".
<p>

This alias will forward all comments to the SPECSFS
mailing list (which includes the LADDIS Group).
<p>

<dt>LIMITATIONS
<dd>LADDIS is for local Ethernet or FDDI nets only, not
WAN.
<p>

HARDWAE REQUIRED
A host with LAN connectivity.  Presumably, a host with
enough horsepower to generate an adequate work load.
<p>

<dt>SOFTWARE REQUIRED
<dd>LADDIS is a sophisticated Unix-based NFS traffic
generator program.

<dd>From: bnelson (Bruce Nelson)
<p>

Dear Person:
<p>

The SPEC PRE-LADDIS beta test process became
operational on Monday, February 3, 1992.  This email
describes the process as announced during the LADDIS
Group's presentation at UniForum '92 and
also at Interop '91. The content of the beta test
license and the license request process are consistent
with the proposals approved by the SPEC Steering
Committee at the January 1992 meeting in Milpitas,
California.
<p>

The SPEC PRE-LADDIS beta test will consist of one beta
test version of PRE-LADDIS distributed ONLY by
electronic mail. The SPEC PRE-LADDIS Beta test
software is licensed by SPEC, not by the LADDIS
Group.
<p>

To obtain the PRE-LADDIS Beta test software, an
individual must:
<p>

<br>1.  Request the SPEC PRE-LADDIS beta test License by
electronic mail to
"spec-preladdis-beta-test@riscee.pko.dec.com" with a
subject line of "Request SPEC PRE-LADDIS Beta Test
License".
<br>2.  Print a hardcopy of the license and sign.
<br>3.  Attach a cover letter written on the individual's
company letterhead requesting the PRE-LADDIS Beta
Test Kit.
<br>4.  U.S. Mail the signed license and cover letter to:
<br>SPEC PRE-LADDIS Beta Test
<br>c/o NCGA, 2722 Merrilee Drive, Suite 200
<br>Fairfax, VA 22031
<p>

After completing these steps, the SPEC PRE-LADDIS beta
test kit will be emailed to the requestor from
riscee.pko.dec.com. The licensee is requested to
direct beta test comments via electronic mail
to "spec-preladdis-comments@riscee.pko.dec.com". This
alias will forward all comments to the SPECSFS mailing
list (which includes the
LADDIS Group).
<p>

Note that PRE-LADDIS is ONLY available through
electronic mail and ONLY through the process listed
above in steps 1-4. If you do not have internet email
available to you (which is unlikely if you are
receiving THIS email), you must arrange delivery of
PRE-LADDIS through some email-capable part of your
organization, not through LADDIS members like Auspex,
DEC, Sun, etc.

<dt>NAME
<dd>LAN Patrol
<p>

<dt>KEYWORDS
<dd>security, traffic; ethernet, star; eavesdrop; DOS.
<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>LAN Patrol is a full-featured network analyzer that
provides essential information for effective fault and
performance management.  It allows network managers to
easily monitor user activity, find traffic overloads,
plan for growth, test cable, uncover intruders, balance
network services, and so on.  LAN Patrol uses state of
the art data collection techniques to monitor all
activity on a network, giving an accurate picture of
how it is performing.
<p>

LAN Patrol's reports can be saved as ASCII files to
disk, and imported into spreadsheet or database pro
grams for further analysis.
<p>

<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>The LAN Patrol interface driver programs a standard
interface card to capture all traffic on a network seg
ment.  The driver operates from the background of a
standard PC, maintaining statistics for each station on
the network.  The information can be viewed on the PC's
screen, or as a user-defined report output either to
file or printer.
<p>

<dt>CAVEATS
<dd>None.  Normal operation is completely passive, making
LAN Patrol transparent to the network.
<p>

<dt>BUGS
<dd>None known.
<p>

<dt>LIMITATIONS
<dd>LAN Patrol can monitor up to 10,000 packets/sec on an
AT class PC, and is limited to monitoring a maximum of
1024 stations for intervals of up to 30 days.
<p>

Because LAN Patrol operates at the physical level, it
will only see traffic for the segment on which it is
installed; it cannot see traffic across bridges.

<dt>NAME
<dd>LANVista
<p>

<dt>KEYWORDS
<dd>analyzer, benchmark, debugger, generator, manager, traffic;
DECnet, Ethernet, IP, OSI, Ring; Eavesdrop, Proprietary;
DOS, Standalone.
<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>CXR/Digilog's LANVista family of protocol and statistical
analyzers provide the tools to troubleshoot an Ethernet and
Token Ring 4/16Mbps network.  LANVista lets you capture
frames to RAM and or disk, generate traffic for stress
testing, test your network cable for fault isolation, and
decode all 7 layers of many popular protocol stacks.
LANVista's 100 family offers exceptional price/performance
and a wide range of options. Combined with an
integrated upgrade path to the fully distributed LANVista
200 system, the 100 line provides a  reasonably priced
entry into LAN management and protocol analysis.
<p>

All LANVista models are fully operable under Microsoft
Windows. Under Windows, LANVista can be operated in
the background, gathering data and alarms as other
tasks are completed. Displayed data may easily be
cut from LANVista and pasted into other Windows
applications such as Excel, Lotus 1-2-3, Harvard
Graphics, etc.
<p>

The versatile LANVista family can also be remotely
controlled through the use of PC Anywhere, Commute,
Carbon Copy, or other PC remote control packages.
This feature allows the use of "co-pilot" mode which
enables an operator at the central site to guide and
train a remote operator through network management or
analysis tasks.
<p>

All LANVista models provide features vital to effective
network management and troubleshooting.  Basic
capabilities include: Network database, statistics
based on the entire network and on a node basis, Token
Ring functional address statistics, Bridged  traffic
statistics, Protocol statistics, logging of statistics
to a printer or file of user definable alarms, Hardware
Pre-Capture filtering, Post capture filtering, Playback of
captured data, Traffic simulation and On-line context
sensitive Help.
<p>

Protocol Interpreters used for decoding network traffic
supported by LANVista include: TCP/IP, DECnet, Banyan
Vines, XNS/MS-Net, AppleTalk, IBM Token Ring, Novell,
3Com 3+ Open, SNMP and OSI.
<p>

<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>LANVista is available in three forms.  A kit version which
consists of a plug-in PC card and Master software, a self
contained unit that packages the kit version in a portable
PC, and a Distributed system.  The LANVista distributed
system allows slave units placed anywhere in the world to
be controlled from a single central location for
centralized management of an enterprise network.
LANVista's PC cards provides a physical interface to
the LAN and frame preprocessing power.  The Master
software controls the PC card, and the display and
processing of information gathered from the network.
<p>

<dt>CAVEATS
<dd>Optimal performance of LANVista's master software is achieved
with DOS 5.0 by utilizing RAMDRIVE.SYS, SMARTDRV.SYS and High
memory.

Internet Tool Catalog                               LANPROBE
<p>
<dl>

<dt>NAME
<dd>LanProbe -- the HP 4990S LanProbe Distributed Analysis
System.
<p>

<dt>KEYWORDS
<dd>alarm, manager, map, status, traffic; ethernet; eaves
drop, NMS; proprietary.
<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>The LanProbe distributed monitoring system performs
remote and local monitoring of ethernet LANs in a pro
tocol and vendor independent manner.
<p>

LanProbe discovers each active node on a segment and
displays it on a map with its adapter card vendor name,
ethernet address, and IP address.  Additional informa
tion about the nodes, such as equipment type and physi
cal location can be entered in to the data base by the
user.
<p>

When the NodeLocator option is used, data on the actual
location of nodes is automatically entered and the map
becomes an accurate representation of the physical lay
out of the segment.  Thereafter when a new node is
installed and becomes active, or when a node is moved
or becomes inactive, the change is detected and shown
on the map in real time.  The system also provides the
network manager with precise cable fault information
displayed on the map.
<p>

Traffic statistics are gathered and displayed and can
be exported in (comma delimited) CSV format for further
analysis.  Alerts can be set on user defined thres
holds.
<p>

Trace provides a remote protocol analyzer capability
with decodes for common protocols.
<p>

Significant events (like power failure, cable breaks,
new node on network, broadcast IP source address seen,
etc.) are tracked in a log that is uploaded to Pro
beView periodically.
<p>

ProbeView generates reports that can be manipulated by
MSDOS based word processors, spreadsheets, and DBMS.
<p>

<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>The system consists of one or more LanProbe segment
monitors and ProbeView software running under Microsoft
Windows.  The LanProbe segment monitor attaches to the
end of an ethernet segment and monitors all traffic.
Attachment can be direct to a thin or thick coax cable,
or via an external transceiver to fiber optic or twist
ed pair cabling.  Network data relating to the segment
is transferred to a workstation running ProbeView via
RS-232, ethernet, or a modem connection.
<p>

ProbeView software, which runs on a PC/AT class works
tation, presents network information in graphical
displays.
<p>

The HP4992A NodeLocator option attaches to the opposite
end of the cable from the HP4991A LanProbe segment mon
itor.  It automatically locates the position of nodes
on the ethernet networks using coaxial cabling schemes.

Internet Tool Catalog                               LANWATCH
<p>
<dl>

<dt>NAME
<dd>LANWatch
<p>

<dt>KEYWORDS
<dd>alarm, analyzer, traffic; CHAOS, DECnet, DNS, ethernet,
IP, OSI, ring, SMTP, star; eavesdrop; DOS; library,
sourcelib.
<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>LANWatch 2.0 is an inexpensive, powerful and flexible
network analyzer that runs under DOS on personal com
puters and requires no hardware modifications to either
the host or the network.  LANWatch is an invaluable
tool for installing, troubleshooting, and monitoring
local area networks, and for developing and debugging
new protocols.  Network managers using LANWatch can
inspect network traffic patterns and packet errors to
isolate performance problems and bottlenecks.  Protocol
developers can use LANWatch to inspect and verify
proper protocol handling.  Since LANWatch is a
software-only package which installs easily in existing
PCs, network technicians and field service engineers
can carry LANWatch in their briefcase for convenient
network analysis at remote sites.
<p>

LANWatch has two operating modes: Display and Examine.
In Display Mode, LANWatch traces network traffic by
displaying captured packets in real time.  Examine Mode
allows you to scroll back through stored packets to
inspect them in detail.  To select a subset of packets
for display, storage or retrieval, there is an exten
sive set of built-in filters.  Using filters, LANWatch
collects only packets of interest, saving the user from
having to sort through all network traffic to isolate
specific packets.  The built-in filters include alarm,
trigger, capture, load, save and search.  They can be
controlled separately to match on source or destination
address, protocol, or packet contents at the hardware
and transport layers.  LANWatch also includes suffi
cient source code so users can modify the existing
filters and parsers or add new ones.
<p>

The LANWatch distribution includes executables and
source for several post-processors: a TCP protocol
analyzer, a node-by-node traffic analyzer and a dump
file listing tool.
<p>



<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>Uses many common PC network interfaces by placing them
in promiscuous mode and capturing traffic.
<p>

<dt>CAVEATS
<dd>Most PC network interfaces will not capture 100% of the
traffic on a fully-loaded network (primarily missing
back-to-back packets).
<p>

<dt>BUGS
<dd>None known.
<p>

<dt>LIMITATIONS
<dd>LANWatch can't analyze what it doesn't see (see
Caveats).
<p>

<dt>HARDWARE REQUIRED
<dd>LANWatch requires a PC or PS/2 with a supported network
interface card.
<p>

<dt>SOFTWARE REQUIRED
<dd>LANWatch runs in DOS.  Modification of the supplied
source code or creation of additional filters and
parsers requires Microsoft C 5.1
<p>

<dt>AVAILABILITY

Internet Tool Catalog                               LLL_ENTM
<p>
<dl>

<dt>NAME
<dd>ENTM -- Ethernet Traffic Monitor
<p>

<dt>KEYWORDS
<dd>traffic; ethernet, IP; eavesdrop; VMS; free.
<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>ENTM is a screen-oriented utility that runs under
VAX/VMS.  It monitors local ethernet traffic and
displays either a real time or cumulative, histogram
showing a percent breakdown of traffic by ethernet pro
tocol type.  The information in the display can be
reported based on packet count or byte count.  The per
cent of broadcast, multicast and approximate lost pack
ets is reported as well.  The screen display is updated
every three seconds.  Additionally, a real time, slid
ing history window may be displayed showing ethernet
traffic patterns for the last five minutes.
<p>

ENTM can also report IP traffic statistics by packet
count or byte count.  The IP histograms reflect infor
mation collected at the TCP and UDP port level, includ
ing ICMP type/code combinations.  Both the ethernet and
IP histograms may be sorted by ASCII protocol/port name
or by percent-value.  All screen displays can be saved
in a file for printing later.
<p>

<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>This utility simply places the ethernet controller in
promiscuous mode and monitors the local area network
traffic.  It preallocates 10 receive buffers and
attempts to keep 22 reads pending on the ethernet dev
ice.
<p>

<dt>CAVEATS
<dd>Placing the ethernet controller in promiscuous mode may
severly slow down a VAX system.  Depending on the speed
of the VAX system and the amount of traffic on the  lo
cal  ethernet,  a large amount of CPU time may be spent
on the Interrupt Stack.  Running this code on any  pro
duction system during operational hours is discouraged.
<p>

<dt>BUGS
<dd>Due to a bug in the VAX/VMS ethernet/802 device driver,
IEEE  802 format packets may not always be detected.  A
simple test is performed to "guess" which  packets  are
in  IEEE  802  format (DSAP equal to SSAP).  Thus, some
DSAP/SSAP pairs may be reported as  an  ethernet  type,
while  valid ethernet types may be reported as IEEE 802
packets.
<p>

In some hardware configurations, placing an ethernet
controller in promiscuous mode with automatic-restart
enabled will hang the controller.  Our VAX 8650 hangs
running this code, while our uVAX IIs and uVAX IIIs do
not.

<p>

<dt>LIMITATIONS
<dd>The user is required to have PHY_IO, TMPMBX and NETMBX
privileges.  When activated, the program first checks
that the user process as enough quotas remaining
(BYTLM, BIOLM, ASTLM and PAGFLQUO) to successfully run
the program without entering into an involuntary wait
state.  Some quotas require a fairly generous setting.
<p>

The contents of IEEE 802 packets are not examined.
Only the presence of IEEE 802 packets on the wire is
reported.
<p>

The count of lost packets is approximated.  If, after
each read completes on the ethernet device, the utility
detects that it has no reads pending on that device,
the lost packet counter is incremented by one.
<p>

When the total number of bytes processed exceeds
7fffffff hex, all counters are automatically reset to
zero.
<p>

<dt>HARDWARE REQUIRED

<p>

<dt>KEYWORDS
<dd>manager, map; CHAOS, ethernet, IP, ring, star; NMS,

<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>Map draws a map of network connectivity and allows
interactive examination of information about various
components including whether hosts can be reached over
the network.
<p>

The program is supplied with complete source and is
written in a modular fashion to make addition of dif
ferent protocols stacks, displays, or hardcopy devices
relatively easy.  This is one of the reasons why the
initial version supports at least two of each.  Contri
butions of additional drivers in any of these areas
will be welcome as well as porting to additional plat
forms.
<p>

<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>Net components are pinged by use of ICMP echo and,
optionally, CHAOS status requests and SNMP "gets."  The
program initializes itself from static data stored in
the file system and therefore does not need to access
the network in order to get running (unless the static
files are network mounted).
<p>

<dt>CAVEATS
<dd>As of publication, the tool is in beta release.
<p>

<dt>BUGS

those from Hughes LAN Systems.
<p>

A comprehensive relational database manages the data and
ensures easy access and control of resources throughout
the network.
<p>

Monet provides multivendor management through its
advanced Mib master MIB parser that allows the parsing
of enterprise MIBs (ASN.1 format per RFC1212) directly
into the RDBMS for use by Monet's applications.
<p>

Major features include:
<p>

Remote access with X:
<br>Use of the X/Motif user-interface, enabling remote
access to the all applications.
<p>

Database Management
<br>Stores and retrieves the information required to
administer and configure the network.  It can be
used to:<p>
<ul>
<li> Store and recall configuration data for all
devices.
<li> Provide availability history for devices.
<li> Assign new internet addresses.
<li> Provide administrative information such as
physical location of devices, responsible
person, maintenance history, asset data,
hardware/software versions, etc.
<li> Full-function SQL interface.
<li> User-customizable RDBMS report generation.
</ul>
<p>


Graphics and Network Mapping
<br>The Graphics module enables the user to view the
nodes in the network as "dynamic" icons in
heirarchical maps.  The network is represented by
these heirarchical maps.  Though there is a
library of device icons, cities and geographical
maps included, the user has access to a
graphics editor that allows customizing and the
creation of new icons and maps.
A Device's icon may be selected to:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Register/deregister the device,
<li> Access the open alarms and acknowledge
faults for the selected device,
<li> Ping the device to determine accessibility,
<li> Draw graphs of any of the device's numeric
MIB objects, either the values as retrieved
in real-time or the history values
previously stored in the RDBMS by the
Performance Manager,
<li> Telnet to the device,
<li> Customize the graphical dynamics (color,
fill, rotation, etc.) of the device's icon
by associating them to the values of the
device's MIB objects.
</ul>
<p>

Configuration Management
<p>
<ul>
<li> Retrieves configuration information from SNMP
devices.
<li> Stores device parameters in the RDBMS, with
common sets of parameters used for multiple
devices, or for multiple ports on a device,
stored only once in the RDBMS.
<li> Configures devices from the parameters stored in
the RDBMS, including those relating to TCP/IP,
DECnet and any other protocol/feature
configurable via SNMP.
<li> Polls devices to compare their current parameter
values with those in the database and produce
reports of the discrepancies.
<li> Collect data about the state of the network.
<li> Learn the parameters of the devices in the
network and populate the database.
</ul>
<p>

Performance Management
<p>
<ul>
<li> Displays local network traffic graphically, by
packet size, protocol, network utilization,
sources and destinations of packets, etc.
<li> Provides for the scheduling of jobs to retrieve
MIB values of a device and store them in the RDBMS
for review or summary reporting at a later time.
<li> Allows high/low thresholds to be set on retrieved
values with alarms generated when thresholds are
exceeded.
</ul>
<p>

Fault Management
<p>
<ul>
<li> Provides availability monitoring and indicates
potential problems.
<li> Creates alarms from received SNMP traps, and from
other internally-generated conditions,
<li> Records alarms in the alarm log in the RDBMS.
<li> Lists alarms for selected set of devices,
according to various filter conditions,
<li> Possible causes and suggested actions for the
alarms are listed.
<li> New alarms are indicated by a flashing icon and
optional audio alert.
<li> Visual indication of alarms bubbles up the network
map heirarchy.
<li> Cumulative reports can be produced.
</ul>
<p>

Utilities Function
<p>
<ul>
<li> View and/or terminate current NMC processes,
<li> Access to database maintenance utilities.
</ul>

Internet Tool Catalog                            NET_MONITOR
<p>
<dl>

<dt>NAME
<dd>net_monitor
<p>

<dt>KEYWORDS
<dd>routing, status; DECnet, IP; curses, ping; UNIX, VMS;
free, sourcelib.
<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>Net_monitor uses ICMP echo (and DECnet reachability
information on VAX/VMS) to monitor a network.  The mon
itoring is very simplistic, but has proved useful.  It
periodically tests whether hosts are reachable and
reports the results in a full-screen display.  It
groups hosts together in common sets.  If all hosts in
a set become unreachable, it makes a lot of racket with
bells, since it assumes that this means that some com
mon piece of hardware that supports that set has
failed.  The periodicity of the tests, hosts to test,
and groupings of hosts are controlled with a single
configuration file.
<p>

The idea for this program came from the PC/IP monitor
facility, but is an entirely different program with
different functionality.
<p>

<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>Reachability is tested using ICMP echo facilities for
TCP/IP hosts (and DECnet reachability information on
VAX/VMS).  A DECnet node is considered reachable if it
appears in the list of hosts in a "show network" com
mand issued on a routing node.
<p>

<dt>CAVEATS
<dd>This facility has been found to be most useful when run
in a window on a workstation rather than on a terminal
connected to a host.  It could be useful if ported to a
PC (looks easy using FTP Software's programming
libraries), but this has not been done.  Curses is very
slow and cpu intensive on VMS, but the tool has been
run in a window on a VAXstation 2000.  Just don't try
to run it on a terminal connected to a 11/750.
<p>

<dt>BUGS
<dd>None known.
<p>


<dt>LIMITATIONS
<dd>This tool is not meant to be a replacement for a more
comprehensive network management facility such as is
provided with SNMP.
<p>

<dt>HARDWARE REQUIRED
<dd>A host with a network connection.
<p>

<dt>SOFTWARE REQUIRED
<dd>Curses, 4.xBSD UNIX socket programming libraries (lim
ited set) and some flavor of TCP/IP that supports ICMP
echo request (ping).  It has been run on VAX/VMS run
ning WIN/TCP and several flavors of 4BSD UNIX (includ
ing SunOS 3.2, 4.0, and 4.3BSD).  It could be ported to
any platform that provides a BSD-style programming li
brary with an ICMP echo request facility and curses.

<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>Netlabs' Dual Manager provides management of TCP/IP
networks using both SNMP and CMOT protoocls.  Such
management can be initiated either through the X-
Windows user interface (both Motif and Openlook), or
through OSI Network Management (CMIP) commands.  The
Dual Manager provides for configuration, fault, secu
rity and performance management.  It provides extensive
map management features, including scanned maps in the
background.  It provides simple mechanisms to extend
the MIB and assign specific lists of objects to
specific network elements, thereby providing for the
management of all vendors' specific MIB extensions.  It
provides an optional relational DBMS for storing and
retrieving MIB and alarm information.  Finally, the
Dual Manager is an open platform, in that it provides
several Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for
users to extend the functionality of the Dual Manager.
<p>

The Dual Manager is expected to work as a TCP/IP
"branch manager" under DEC's EMA, AT &amp T's UNMA and other
OSI-conformant enterprise management architectures.

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>The NetMetrix Load Monitor is a distributed
client-server monitoring tool for ethernet, token
ring, and FDDI networks.  A unique "dual" architecture
provides compatibility with both RMON and X windows.
RMON allows interoperability and an enterprise-wide
view, while X windows enables much more powerful,
intelligent applications at remote segments and saves
network bandwidth.
<p>

The Load Monitor provides extensive traffic
statistics.  It looks at load by time interval, source
node, destination node, application, protocol or
packet size. A powerful ZOOM feature allows extensive
correlational analysis which is displayed in a wide
variety of graphs and tables.
<p>

You can answer questions such as: Which sources are
generating most of the load on the network when it is
most heavily loaded and where is this load going?
Which source/destination pairs generate the most
traffic over the day?  Where should bridges and
routers be located to optimally partition the network?
How much load do applications, like the X Windows
protocol, put on the network and who is generating that
load when it is the greatest.

<dl>

<dt>NAME
<dd>NETMON and iptrace
<p>

<dt>KEYWORDS
<dd>traffic; IP; eavesdrop; UNIX; free.
<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>NETMON is a facility to enable communication of net
working events from the BSD UNIX operating system to a
user-level network monitoring or management program.
Iptrace is a program interfacing to NETMON which logs
TCP-IP traffic for performance measurement and gateway
monitoring. It is easy to build other NETMON-based
tools using iptrace as a model.
<p>

NETMON resides in the 4.3BSD UNIX kernel.  It is
independent of hardware-specific code in UNIX.  It is
transparent to protocol and network type, having no
internal assumptions about the network protocols being
recorded.  It is installed in BSD-like kernels by
adding a standard function call (probe) to a few points
in the input and output routines of the protocols to be
logged.
<p>

NETMON is analogous to Sun Microsystems' NIT, but the
interface tap function is extended by recording more
context information.  Aside from the timestamp, the
choice of information recorded is up to the installer
of the probes.  The NETMON probes added to the BSD IP
code supplied with the distribution include as context:
input and output queue lengths, identification of the
network interface, and event codes labeling packet dis
cards.  (The NETMON distribution is geared towards
measuring the performance of BSD networking protocols
in an IP gateway).
<p>

NETMON is designed so that it can reside within the
monitored system with minimal interference to the net
work processing.  The estimated and measured overhead
is around five percent of packet processing.
<p>

The user-level tool "iptrace" is provided with NETMON.
This program logs IP traffic, either at IP-level only,
or as it passes through the network interface drivers
as well.  As a separate function, iptrace produces a
host traffic matrix output.  Its third type of output
is abbreviated sampling, in which only a pre-set number
of packets from each new host pair is logged.  The
three output types are configured dynamically, in any
combination.
<p>

OSITRACE, another logging tool with a NETMON interface,
is available separately (and documented in a separate
entry in this catalog).
<p>

<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>Access to the information logged by NETMON is through a
UNIX special file, /dev/netmon.  User reads are blocked
until the buffer reaches a configurable level of full
ness.
<p>

Several other parameters of NETMON can be tuned at com
pile time.  A diagnostic program, netmonstat, is
included in the distribution.

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>The NETMON application implements a powerful network
management station based on a low-cost DOS platform.
NETMON's network management tools for configuration,
performance, security, and fault management have been
used successfully with a wide assortment of wide- and
local-area-network topologies and medias.  Multiprotocol
devices are supported including those using TCP/IP,
DECnet, and OSI protocols.
<p>

Some features of NETMON's network management tools include:
<p>
<ul>

<li> Fault management tool displays a map of the network
configuration with node and link state indicated
in one of several colors to indicate current status;
<li> Configuration management tool may be used to edit the
network management information base stored in the
NMS to reflect changes occurring in the network;
<li> Graphs and tabular tools for use in fault and performance
management;
<li> Mechanisms by which additional variables, such as vendor
specific variables, may be added;
<li> Alarms may be enabled to alert the operator of events
occurring in the network;
<li> Events are logged to disk;
<li> Output data may be transferred via flat files for
additional report generation by a variety of
statistical packages.
</ul>
<p>

The NETMON application comes complete with source code
including a powerful set of portable libraries for generating
and parsing SNMP messages.
<p>


<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>The NETMON for Windows application is based on the

Internet Tool Catalog                               NETscout
<p>
<dl>

<dt>NAME
<dd>NETscout(tm)
<p>

<dt>KEYWORDS
<dd>Alarm, Analyzer, Manager, Status, Traffic;
DECnet, Ethernet, IP, OSI, NFS, Ring, Star, Eavesdrop;
NMS, SNMP;
UNIX;
<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>The NETscout family of distributed LAN Analyzer
devices are intended to provide network users with a
comprehensive capability to identify and isolate fault
conditions in data communications networks.
NETscout has the capability to collect wide ranging
statistical data, to display selectively captured and
fully decoded network traffic, to set user-defined
alarm conditions, and to obtain real-time updates
from all segments of a widely dispersed internetwork
from a centralized SNMP-compatible network management
console.
<p>

The NETscout family is based on standards so that
operation may be realized in heterogeneous networks
which constitute a multi-protocol, multi-topology,
multi-vendor environment.  The fundamental standards
upon which NETscout is based are the Simple Network
Management Protocol (SNMP), which defines the protocol
for all inter-communications between NETscout devices,
and the Remote Monitoring Management Information Base
(RMON-MIB), which defines the type of information
which is to be gathered and made available to the
user for each network segment.
<p>

NETscout clients provide a full array of monitoring
and analysis features including intelligent seven
level decoding of all majorprotocol stacks:
<p>
<Pre>
DOD including TCP/IP    XNS       Novell
DECNET including LAT    ISO       APPLETALK
IBM Token Ring          Vines     NETBIOS/SMB
SNMP including RMON-MIB SUN-NFS   SMT
</pre>
<p>

NETscout agents support all nine groups of the
RMON-MIB standard.  NETscout agents can work with any
SNMP-based network management system and currently
support Ethernet and Token Ring.
<p>

<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>The operation of the NETscout family is divided into
two distinct subcategories.  The first is the "Client"
which is the user console from which operational
commands are issued and where all results and
diagnostic information are displayed. In a NETscout
topology it is feasible to have multiple clients
active simultaneously within a single network.  The
second category is the "Agent", a hardware/software
device which is attached to a specific network
segment and which gathers statistical information for
that segment as well as providing a window into that
segment where network traffic may be observed and
gathered for more detailed user analysis.  A
typical network will have multiple segments and
multiple agents up to the point of having one agent
for each logical network segment.
<p>

NETscout Model 9210 is a software package which, when
combined in a Sun SPARCstation in conjunction with
SunNet Manager running under Open Windows, implements
the NETscout client function.  SunNet Manager provides
the background operational tools for client operation
while the NETscout software provides
application-specific functions related to RMON-MIB
support as well as all software necessary to
perform the protocol decode function.
SunNet Manager also implements a network map file
which includes a topographical display of the entire
network and is the mechanism for selecting
network elements to perform operations.
<p>

NETscout Model 9215 is a software package that
operates in conjunction with SunNet Manager and
implements the statistics monitoring function only.
That is, it does not include the protocol
decode function or the mechanism to retrieve actual
data from a remote agent.  It does, however, include
complete statistics gathering and event and alarm
generation.
<p>

Frontier NETscout Models 9510 and 9515, and Model 9610
and 9615 are agent software packages that implement
selected network diagnostic functions when loaded into
a Sun SPARCstation (9510, 9515) or a SynOptics
LattisNet Hub (9610, 9615) respectively which is
connected to an Ethernet network segment
using conventional network interface hardware.  Models
9510 and 9610 support all nine RMON-MIB groups
including "filters" and "packet capture" and thus
provide for complete protocol monitoring and decode
when used with a client
equipped with protocol decode software.  Models 9515
an 9615 include support for seven RMON-MIB groups
which excludes "filters" and "data capture" and
therefore perform network monitoring only through
collection and presentation of network statistics,
events, and alarms.  All models also support the MIB2
system and interface groups.
<p>

Frontier NETscout Models 9520 and 9525, and Model 9620
and 9625 are agent software packages that are
identical in function to their respective models
described above except that they are for use on
Token Ring segments.
<p>

<dt>CAVEATS
<dd>The RMON-MIB standard for Token Ring applications has
not yet beenformally released and is not approved.
NETscout products correspond to the latest draft for
Token Ring functions and will be updated as
required to conform to the standard as it is approved.

Internet Tool Catalog                     NETWORK_INTEGRATOR
<p>
<dl>

<dt>NAME
<dd>Network Integrator I
<p>

<dt>KEYWORDS
<dd>map, traffic; ethernet; UNIX.
<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>This tool monitors traffic on network segments.  All
information is dumped to either a log file or, for
real-time viewing, to a command tool window.  Data is
time-stamped according to date and time.  Logging can
continue for up to 24 hours.
<p>

The tool is flexible in data collection and presenta
tion.  Traffic filters can be specified according to
header values of numerous protocols, including those
used by Apple, DEC, Sun, HP, and Apollo.  Bandwidth
utilization can be monitored, as well as actual load
and peak throughput.  Additionally, the Network
Integrator can analyze a network's topology, and record
the location of all operational nodes on a network.
<p>

Data can be displayed in six separate formats of bar
graphs.  In addition, there are several routines for
producing statistical summaries of the data collected.
<p>

<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>The tools work through RPC and XDR calls.
<p>

<dt>CAVEATS
<dd>Although the tool adds only little traffic to a net
work, generation of statistics from captured files
requires a significant portion of a workstation's CPU.
<p>

<dt>BUGS
<dd>None known.
<p>

<dt>LIMITATIONS
<dd>Must be root to run monitor.  There does not seem to be
a limit to the number of nodes, since it monitors by
segments.  The only major limitation is the amount of
disk space that a user can commit to the log files.
The size of the log files, however, can be controlled
through the tool's parameters.

Internet Tool Catalog                               NFSwatch
<p>
<dl>

<dt>NAME
<dd>nfswatch
<p>

<dt>KEYWORDS
<dd>Traffic; Ethernet, IP, NFS; Curses, Eavesdrop; UNIX;
Free
<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>Nfswatch monitors all incoming ethernet traffic to an
NFS file server and divides it into several
categories.  The number and percentage of packets
received in each category is displayed on
the screen in a continuously updated display.
<p>

By default, nfswatch monitors all packets destined for
the local host over a single network interface.
Options are provided to specify the specific interface
to be monitored, or all interfaces at once.  NFS
traffic to the local host, to a remote host, from a
specific host, between two hosts, or all NFS traffic
on the network may be monitored.
<p>

Categories of packets monitored and counted include:
ND Read, ND Write, NFS Read, NFS Write, NFS Mount,
Yellow Pages (NIS), RPC Authorization, Other RPC, TCP,
UDP, ICMP, RIP, ARP, RARP, Ethernet Broadcast, and
Other.
<p>

Packets are also tallied either by file system or file
(specific files may be watched as an option), NFS
procedure name (RPC call), or NFS client hostname.
<p>

Facilities for taking "snapshots" of the screen, as
well as saving data to a log file for later analysis
(the analysis tool is included) are also available.
<p>

<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>Nfswatch uses the Network Interface Tap, nit(4) under
SunOS 4.x, and the Packet Filter, packetfilter(4),
under Ultrix 4.x, to place the ethernet interface into
promiscuous mode.  It filters out NFS packets, and
decodes the file handles in order to determine how to
count the packet.
<p>



<dt>CAVEATS
<dd>Because the NFS file handle is a non-standard (server
private) piece of data, nfswatch must be modified to
understand file handles used by various
implementations.  It currently knows
about the SunOS 4.x and Ultrix file handle formats.
<p>

<dt>BUGS
<dd>Does not monitor FDDI interfaces.  (It should be a
simple change, but neither author has access to a
system with FDDI interfaces for testing.)
<p>

<dt>LIMITATIONS
<dd>Up to 256 exported file systems and 256 individual
files can be monitored at any time.
<p>

Only NFS requests are counted; the NFS traffic
generated by a server in response to those packets
is not counted.
<p>

<dt>HARDWARE REQUIRED
<dd>Any Ultrix system (VAX or DEC RISC hardware)
<p>

<dt>SOFTWARE REQUIRED
<dd>Ultrix release 4.0 or later.  For Ultrix 4.1, may
require the patched "if_ln.o" kernel module, available
from Digital's Customer Support Center.

<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>Nhfsstone (pronounced n-f-s-stone, the "h" is silent)
is an NFS benchmarking program.  It is used on an NFS
client to generate an artificial load with a particular
mix of NFS operations.  It reports the average response
time of the server in milliseconds per call and the
load in calls per second.  The nhfsstone distribution
includes a script, "nhfsnums" that converts test
results into plot(5) format so that they can be graphed
using graph(1) and other tools.
<p>

<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>Nhfsstone is an NFS traffic generator.  It adjusts its
calling patterns based on the client's kernel NFS
statistics and the elapsed time.  Load can be generated
over a given time or number of NFS calls.

<dt>NAME
<dd>NNStat
<p>

<dt>KEYWORDS
<dd>manager, status, traffic; ethernet, IP; eavesdrop, NMS;
UNIX; free.
<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>NNStat is a collection of programs that provides an
internet statistic collecting capability.  The NNStat
strategy for statistic collection is to collect traffic
statistics via a promiscuous ethernet tap on the local
networks, versus instrumenting the gateways.  If all
traffic entering or leaving a network or set of net
works traverses a local ethernet, then by stationing a
statistic gathering agent on each local network a pro
file of network traffic can be gathered.  Statistical
data is retrieved from the local agents by a global
manager.
<p>

A program called "statspy" performs the data gathering
function.  Essentially, statspy reads all packets on an
ethernet interface and records all information of
interest.  Information of interest is gathered by exa
mining each packet and determining if the source or
destination IP address is one that is being monitored,
typically a gateway address.  If so then the contents
of the packet are examined to see if they match further
criteria.
<p>

A program called "collect" performs global data collec
tion.  It periodically polls various statspy processes
in the domain of interest to retrieve locally logged
statistical data.
<p>

The NNSTAT distribution comes with several sample awk
programs which process the logged output of the collect
program.
<p>

<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>Local agents (statspy processes) collect raw traffic
data via a promiscuous ethernet tap.  Statistical, fil
tered or otherwise reduced data is retrieved from the
local agents by a global manager (the "collect" pro
cess).

Internet Tool Catalog                               NOCOL(8)
<p>
<dl>

<dt>NAME
<dd>nocol - network monitoring tools for an IP network
<p>

<dt>SYNOPSIS
<dd>This is an overview of the NOCOL software.
<p>

<dt>DESCRIPTION
<dd>NOCOL (Network Operations Center On-Line) is a
collection of network monitoring programs that run on
Unix systems.  The software consists of a number of
monitoring agents that poll various parameters from any
system and put it in a format suitable for
post-processing. The post-processors can be a display
agent, an automated troubleshooting program, an
event logging program, etc.  Presently, monitors for
tracking reachability, SNMP traps, data throughput
rate, and nameservers have been developed and are in
use.  Addition of more monitoring agents is easy and
they will be added as necessary.  A display agent
nocol(1) using curses has already been developed. Work
on an "intelligent" module is currently in progress for
event logging and some automatic troubleshooting.
<p>

All data collected by the monitoring agents follows a
fixed (non-readable) format. Each data entry is termed
an event in NOCOL, and each event has certain flags and
severity associated with it. The display agent
nocol(1), displays the output of these monitoring
agents depending on the severity of the event. There
can be multiple displays running simultanously and
all process the same set of monitored data.
<p>

There are four levels of severity associated with an
event- CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING and INFO. The severity
level is controlled independently by the monitoring
agents, and the decision to raise or set an event's
severity to any level depends on the logic imbedded in
the monitoring agent.
<p>

As an example, for the pingmon(8) monitor, if a site is
unreachable via ping, it would be assigned a severity
of WARNING by pingmon, which would then elevate to
CRITICAL if the site is still unreachable after some
time. In the case of trapmon(8), an SNMP trap message
of EGP neighbor lost would be directly assigned a
severity level of CRITICAL, while an Warm Start trap is
assigned a severity of WARNING.
<p>

The display agent (and other data post-processors)
would use this event severity to decide whether to
display it (or troubleshoot/log it) depending on the
user selected display severity level.
<p>

The software is very flexible and allows enhancements
and development with a minimum amount of effort. The
display module processes all the files present in the
data directory, and displays them sequentially. This
allows new monitoring programs to simply start
generating data in the data directory and the display
module will automatically start displaying the new
data. The monitoring tools can be changed, and the only
element that has to remain common between all the
modules is the EVENT data structure.
<p>

<dt>CURRENT MODULES
<dd>NOCOL presently consists of the following modules:
<p>
<dl>

<dt>nocol
<p>
<dd>which simply displays the data collected by the
monitoring agents.  It uses the curses screen
management system to support a wide variety of terminal
types. The criterion for displaying an event is:
<p>

1. Severity level of the event is higher than the
severity level set in the display.
<p>

2. The display filter (if set) matches some string in
the event line.
<p>

The display can be in regular 80 column mode or in
extended 132 column mode.  Critical events are
displayed in reverse video (if the terminal type
supports it). Additional features like displaying
informational messages in a part of the window,
automatic resizing window sizes, operator
acknowledgement via a bell when a new event goes
critical are also available.
<p>

<dt>ippingmon
<dd>which monitors the reachability of a site via "ICMP"
ping packets (ICMP was preferred over SNMP for many
obvious reasons). This program can use the default out
put from the system's ping program, but an accompanying
program ( multiping) can ping multiple IP sites at the
same time and is preferable for monitoring a large list
of sites.  A site is marked unreachable if a certain
number of packets is lost, and the severity level is
increased each time that the site tests unreachable.
<p>

<Dt>osipingmon
<dd>which is similar to the ippingmon module but uses the
OSI ping program instead. No multiple ping program for
OSI sites has been developed at this time.  The only
requirement is that the system's ping program output
match the typical BSD IP ping program's output.
<p>

<Dt>nsmon
<dd>which monitors the nameservers (named) on the list of
specified hosts. It periodically sends an SOA query for
the default domain and if the queried nameservers
cannot resolve the query, then the site is elevated to
CRITICAL status.
<p>

<dt>tpmon
<dd>For monitoring the throughput (kbits per second) to a
list of hosts.  The program connects to the discard
socket on the remote machine (using  a  STREAM  socket)
and sends large packets for a small amount of time to
evaluate the effective throughput. It elevates a site
to WARNING level if the throughput drops below a
certain threshold (set in the configuration file).
<p>

<dt>trapmon
<dd>Converts all SNMP traps into a format suitable for
displaying using NOCOL.  The severity of the various
traps is preset (and can be changed during compilation
time).
</dl>
<p>


<dt>PLATFORM
<dd>Any Unix system with the curses screen management library
and IP (Internet Protocol) programming facility. It has been
tested on Sun Sparc 4.1.1, Ultrix, and NeXT systems. Porting
to other platforms might require minor adjustments depending
on the vagaries of the different vendors (mostly in the
include files).
<p>

<dt>AVAILABILITY
<dd>NOCOL was developed at JvNCnet and has been in use for
monitoring the JvNCnet wide area network since 1989.
It is available via anonymous FTP from ftp.jvnc.net under
pub/jvncnet-packages/nocol.tar.Z.  The system running at
JvNCet can be viewed by logging into the host nocol.jvnc.net
with username nocol (an rlogin instead of telnet will handle
your X window terminal types better).
To be added to the NOCOL mailing list (for future updates
and bug fixes), send a message to nocol-users-
request@jvnc.net with your email address.
<p>

<dt>FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
<p>

<dd>Possible future enhancements are:
<p>

1. Event logging.
<p>

2. Addition of an automated  troubleshooting  mechanism
when  a  site  severity  level  reaches a particular
level.
<p>

3. SNMP monitors to watch the state  of  certain  vari
ables  (interface  errors,  packet rate, route state
changes).
<p>

<dt>AUTHOR
<dd>The software was developed at JvNCnet over a period of time.
The overall design and initial development was done by Vikas
Aggarwal and Sze-Ying Wuu.  Additional development is being
done and coordinated by Vikas Aggarwal (vikas@jvnc.net).

<dt>NAME
<dd>NPRV -- IP Node/Protocol Reachability Verifier
<p>

<dt>KEYWORDS
<dd>map, routing, status; IP; ping; VMS; free.
<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>NPRV is a full-screen, keypad-oriented utility that
runs under VAX/VMS.  It allows the user to quickly scan
through a user-defined list of IP addresses (or domain
names) and verify a node's reachability.  The node's
reachability is determined by performing an ICMP echo,
UDP echo and a TCP echo at alternating three second
intervals.  The total number of packets sent and
received are displayed, as well as the minimum, average
and maximum round-trip times (in milliseconds) for each
type of echo.  Additionally, a "trace route" function
is performed to determine the path from the local sys
tem to the remote host.  Once all of the trace route
information has filled the screen, a "snapshot" of the
screen can be written to a text file.  Upon exiting the
utility, these text files can be used to generate a
logical network map showing host and gateway intercon
nectivity.
<p>

<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>The ICMP echo is performed by sending ICMP ECHO REQUEST
packets.  The UDP and TCP echoes are performed by con
necting to the UDP/TCP echo ports (port number 7).  The
trace route information is compiled by sending alter
nating ICMP ECHO REQUEST packets and UDP packets with
very large destination UDP port numbers (in two
passes).  Each packet is initially sent with a TTL
(time to live) of 1.  This should cause an ICMP TIME
EXCEEDED error to be generated by the first routing
gateway.  Then each packet is sent with a TTL of 2.
This should cause an ICMP TIME EXCEEDED error to be
generated by the second routing gateway.  Then each
packet is sent with a TTL of 3, and so on.  This pro
cess continues until an ICMP ECHO REPLY or UDP PORT
UNREACHABLE is received.  This indicates that the
remote host has been reached and that the trace route
information is complete.
<p>


<dt>CAVEATS
<dd>This utility sends one echo packet per second (ICMP,
UDP or TCP), as well as sending out one trace route
packet per second.  If a transmitted trace route packet
is returned in less than one second, another trace
route packet is sent in 100 milliseconds.  This could
cause a significant amount of contention on the local
network.

<dt>LIMITATIONS
<dd>The user is required to have SYSPRV privilege to per
form the ICMP Echo and trace route functions.  The
utility will still run with this privilege disabled,
but only the UDP Echo and TCP Echo information will be
displayed.  This utility is written in C, but unfor
tunately it cannot be easily ported over to UNIX since
many VMS system calls are used and all screen I/O is
done using the VMS Screen Management Routines.

<p>

<dt>KEYWORDS
<dd>status; DNS, BIND; UNIX, VMS; free.
<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>Nslookup is an interactive program for querying
Internet Domain Name System (DNS) servers.  It is
essentially a user-friendly front end to
the BIND "resolver" library routines.
<p>

This program is useful for converting a hostname
into an IP address (and vice versa), determining
the name servers for a domain , listing
the contents of a domain, displaying any type of
DNS record, such as MX, CNAME, SOA, etc.,
diagnosing name server problems.
<p>

By default, nslookup will query
the default name server but you can specify a
different server on the command line or from a
configuration file.  You can also specify
different values for the options that control the
resolver routines.
<p>

<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>The program formats, sends and receives DNS
(RFC 1034) queries.

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>OSITRACE is a network performance tool that displays
information about ISO TP4 connections.  One line of
output is displayed for each packet indicating the
time, source, destination, length, packet type,
sequence number, credit, and any optional parameters
contained in the packet.  Numerous options are avail
able to control the output of OSITRACE.
<p>

To obtain packets to analyze, OSITRACE uses Sun
Microsystems' Network Interface Tap (NIT) in SunOS 3.4,
3.5, and 4.0.X.  OSITRACE may also obtain data from the
NETMON utility which is described as another tool
entry.
<p>

In Sun systems, OSITRACE may be easily installed: OSI
kernel support is not needed, nor is any other form of
OSI software support.
<p>

<dt>MECHANISM

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>SNMP proxy agents may be used to permit the monitoring

(e.g., a network bridge that implements a proprietary
management protocol).  Similarly, SNMP proxy agents may
be used to protect SNMP agents from redundant network
management agents through the use of caches.  Finally,
SNMP proxy agents may be used to implement elaborate
MIB access policies.
<p>

The proxy agent daemon:
<p>
<ul>
<li> listens for SNMP queries and commands from logically
remote network management stations,
<li> translates and retransmits those as appropriate
network management queries or cache lookups,
<li> listens for and parses the responses,
<li> translates the responses into SNMP responses, and
<li> returns those responses as SNMP messages to the
network management station that originated the
transaction.
</ul>
<p>

The proxy agent daemon also emits SNMP traps to
identified trap receivers.  The proxy agent daemon is
designed to make the addition of additional vendor-
specific variables a straight-forward task.  The proxy
application comes complete with source code including a
powerful set of portable libraries for generating and

<p>
<dl>

<dt>NAME
<dd>Sniffer
<p>

<dt>KEYWORDS
<dd>analyzer, generator, traffic; DECnet, ethernet, IP,
NFS, OSI, ring, SMTP, star; eavesdrop; standalone.
<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>The Network General Sniffer is a protocol analyzer for
performing LAN diagnostics, monitoring, traffic genera
tion, and troubleshooting.  The Sniffer protocol
analyzer has the capability of capturing every packet
on a network and of decoding all seven layers of the
OSI protocol model.  Capture frame selection is based
on several different filters: protocol content at lower
levels; node addresses; pattern matching (up to 8
logically-related patterns of 32 bytes each); and des
tination class.  Users may extend the protocol
interpretation capability of the Sniffer by writing
their own customized protocol interpreters and linking
them to the Sniffer software.
<p>

The Sniffer displays network traffic information and
performance statistics in real time, in user-selectable
formats.  Numeric station addresses are translated to
symbolic names or manufacturer ID names.  Network
activities measured include frames accepted, Kbytes
accepted, and buffer use.  Each network version has
additional counters for activities specific to that
network.  Network activity is expressed as
frames/second, Kbytes/second, or per cent of network
bandwidth utilization.
<p>

Data collection by the Sniffer may be output to printer
or stored to disk in either print-file or spread-sheet
format.
<p>

Protocol suites understood by the Sniffer include:
Banyan Vines, IBM Token-Ring, Novell Netware, XNS/MS-
Net (3Com 3+), DECnet, TCP/IP (including SNMP and
applications-layer protocols such as FTP, SMTP, and
TELNET), X Windows (for X version 11), NFS, and several
SUN proprietary protocols (including mount, pmap, RPC,
and YP).  Supported LANs include: ethernet, Token-ring
(4Mb and 16Mb versions), ARCNET, StarLAN, IBM PC Net
work (Broadband), and Apple Localtalk Network.
<p>


<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>The Sniffer is a self-contained, portable protocol
analyzer that require only AC line power and connection
to a network to operate.  Normally passive (except when
in Traffic Generator mode), it captures images of all
or of selected frames in a working buffer, ready for
immediate analysis and display.
<p>

The Sniffer is a standalone device.  Two platforms are
available: one for use with single network topologies,
the other for use with multi-network topologies.  Both
include Sniffer core software, a modified network
interface card (or multiple cards), and optional proto
col interpreter suites.
<p>

All Sniffer functions may be remotely controlled from a
modem-connected PC.  Output from the Sniffer can be
imported to database or spreadsheet packages.
<p>

<dt>CAVEATS
<dd>In normal use, the Sniffer is a passive device, and so
will not adversely effect network performance.  Perfor
mance degradation will be observed, of course, if the
Sniffer is set to Traffic Generator mode and connected
to an active network.
<p>

<dt>BUGS
<dd>None known.
<p>

<dt>LIMITATIONS
<dd>None reported.
<p>

<dt>HARDWARE REQUIRED
<dd>None.  The Sniffer is a self-contained unit, and

<dt>NAME
<dd>SNMP Libraries and Utilities from SNMP Research.
<p>

<dt>KEYWORDS
<dd>alarm, control, manager, map, security, status;
bridge, DECnet, Ethernet, FDDI, IP, OSI, ring, star;

<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>The SNMP Libraries and Utilities serve two purposes:
<p>

1)   to act as building blocks for the construction of
SNMP-based agent and manager applications; and
<p>

2)   to act as network management tools for network
fire fighting and report generation.
<p>

The libraries perform ASN.1 parsing and generation tasks
for both network management station applications and
network management agent applications.  These libraries
hide the details of ASN.1 parsing and generation from
application writers and make it unnecessary for them to
be expert in these areas.  The libraries are very robust
with considerable error checking designed in.  The
several command line utilities include applications for
retrieving one or many variables, retrieving tables, or
effecting commands via the setting of remote network
management variables.
<p>

<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>The parsing is performed via recursive descent methods.
Messages are passed via the Simple Network Management
Protocol (SNMP).
<p>

<dt>CAVEATS
<dd>None.
<p>

<dt>BUGS
<dd>None known.
<p>

<dt>LIMITATIONS
<dd>The monitored and managed nodes must implement the SNMP
over UDP per RFC 1157 or must be reachable via a proxy
agent.

<p>
<dl>

<dt>NAME
<dd>SpiderMonitor P220, K220 and
SpiderAnalyzer P320, K320
<p>

<dt>KEYWORDS
<dd>alarm, analyzer, generator, traffic; DECnet, ethernet,
IP, OSI; eavesdrop; standalone; sourcelib.
<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>The SpiderMonitor and SpiderAnalyzer are protocol
analyzers for performing ethernet LAN diagnostics, mon
itoring, traffic generation, and troubleshooting.  The
SpiderMonitor has the capability of capturing every
packet on a network and of decoding the first four
layers of the OSI protocol model.  The SpiderAnalyzer
has additional software for decoding higher protocol
layers.  Protocol suites understood: TCP/IP (including
SNMP and applications-layer protocols), OSI, XNS, DEC-
net and IPX.  User-definable decodes can be written in
'C' with the Microsoft version 5.0 'C' compiler.  A
decode guide is provided.
<p>

The SpiderAnalyzer supports multiple simultaneous
filters for capturing packets using predefined patterns
and error states.  Filter patterns can also trigger on
NOT matching 1 or more filters, an alarm, or a speci
fied time.
<p>

The SpiderAnalyzer can also employ TDR (Time Domain
Reflectometry) to find media faults, open or short cir
cuits, or transceiver faults.  It can transmit OSI,
XNS, and Xerox link-level echo packets to user-
specified stations, performs loop round tests.
<p>

In traffic generation mode, the SpiderAnalyzer has the
ability to generate packets at random intervals of ran
dom lengths or any combination of random or fixed
interval or length, generation of packets with CRC
errors, or packets that are too short, or packets that
are too long.
<p>

Output from the SpiderMonitor/Analyzer can be imported
to database or spreadsheet packages.
<p>


<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>The SpiderMonitor and Spider Analyzer are available as
stand-alone, IBM PC compatible packages based upon a
Compaq III portable system, or as a plug-in boards for
any IBM XT/AT compatible machine.  The model 220 (Spi
derMonitor) systems provide a functional base suited
for most network management needs.  The model 320 (Spi
derAnalyzer) systems provide extended functionality in
the development mode and traffic generation mode as
well more filtering capabilities than the 220 models.
<p>

<dt>CAVEATS
<dd>Traffic generation will congest an operational ether
net.
<p>

<dt>BUGS
<dd>None known.
<p>

<dt>LIMITATIONS
<dd>Monitoring of up to 1024 stations and buffering of up
to 1500 packets.  The model 220 provides for 3 filters
with a filter depth of 46 bytes.  The model 320 pro
vides for 4 filters and a second level of filtering
with a filter depth of 64 bytes.
<p>

<dt>HARDWARE REQUIRED
<dd>PX20s are self contained, the KX20s require an IBM
PC/XT-AT compatible machine with 5 megabytes of hard
disk storage and the spare slot into which the board
kit is plugged.
<p>

<dt>SOFTWARE REQUIRED
<dd>None.  The SpiderAnalyzer requires the Microsoft 'C'
Compiler, Version 5.0 for writing user defined decodes.

<p>
<dl>

<dt>NAME
<dd>SPIMS -- the Swedish Institute of Computer Science
(SICS) Protocol Implementation Measurement
System tool.
<p>

<dt>KEYWORDS
<dd>benchmark, debugger; IP, OSI; spoof; UNIX.
<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>SPIMS is used to measure the performance of protocol
and "protocol-like" services including response time
(two-way delay), throughput and the time to open and
close connections.  It has been used to:
<p>

o    benchmark alternative protocol implementations,
<p>

o    observe how performance varies when parameters in
specific implementations have been varied (i.e.,
to tune parameters).
<p>

SPIMS currently has interfaces to the DoD Internet Pro
tocols: UDP, TCP, FTP, SunRPC, the OSI protocols from
the ISODE 4.0 distribution package: FTAM, ROSE, ISO TP0
and to Sunlink 5.2 ISO TP4 as well as Stanford's VMTP.
Also available are a rudimentary set of benchmarks,
stubs for new protocol interfaces and a user manual.
<p>

For an example of the use of SPIMS to tune protocols,
see:
Nordmark  &amp  Cheriton, "Experiences from VMTP: How
to achieve low response time," IFIP WG6.1/6.4:
Protocols for High-Speed Networks, May 1989,
Zurich.  To be published.
<p>

For an example of how SPIMS can be used to benchmark
protocols, see:

<p>


<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>SPIMS runs as user processes and uses a TCP connection
for measurement set-up.  Measurements take place
between processes over the measured protocol.  SPIMS
generates messages and transfers them via the measured
protocol service according to a user-supplied specifi
cation.  SPIMS has a unique measurement specification
language that is used to specify a measurement session.
In the language there are constructs for different
application types (e.g., bulk data transfer), for
specifying frequency and sequence of messages, for dis
tribution over message sizes and for combining basic
specifications.  These specifications are independent
of both protocols and protocol implementations and can
be used for benchmarking.  For more details on the
internals of SPIMS, see:

<p>

These organizations can chose between a license for
commercial use, or a license for internal research
only and no commercial use whatsoever.
<p>

For internal research use only:
<p>

The SPIMS source code is distributed for a one
time fee of US$500.00.  Organizations
interested in the research prototype need to
contact us via e-mail and briefly motivate why
they qualify (non-commercial use) for the
research prototype.
They will thereafter get a permission to
obtain a copy from the same distribution
source as for universities.
<p>

Commercial use:
<p>

A commercial version of SPIMS will eventually
be distributed and supported by a commercial
partner.  nIn the meantime we will distribute
the research prototype (source code) to
interested organizations without any guaranty
or support.  Contact SICS for further

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>Spray is a traffic generation tool that generates RPC
or UDP packets, or ICMP Echo Requests.  The packets are
sent to a remote procedure call application at the des
tination host.  The count of received packets is
retrieved from the remote application after a certain
number of packets have been transmitted.  The differ
ence in packets received versus packets sent represents
(on a LAN) the packets that the destination host had to
drop due to increasing queue length.  A measure of
throughput relative to system speed and network load
can thus be obtained.

<dl>

<dt>NAME
<dd>traceroute
<p>

<dt>KEYWORDS
<dd>routing; IP; ping; UNIX, VMS; free.
<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>Traceroute is a tool that allows the route taken by
packets from source to destination to be discovered.
It can be used for situations where the IP record route
option would fail, such as intermediate gateways dis
carding packets, routes that exceed the capacity of an
datagram, or intermediate IP implementations that don't
support record route.  Round trip delays between the
source and intermediate gateways are also reported
allowing the determination of individual gateways con
tribution to end-to-end delay.
<p>

Enhanced versions of traceroute have been developed
that allow specification of loose source routes for
datagrams.  This allows one to investigate the return
path from remote machines back to the local host.
<p>

<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>Traceroute relies on the ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED error
reporting mechanism.  When an IP packet is received by
an gateway with a time-to-live value of 0, an ICMP
packet is sent to the host which generated the packet.
By sending packets to a destination with a TTL of 0,
the next hop can be identified as the source of the
ICMP TIME EXCEEDED message.  By incrementing the TTL
field the subsequent hops can be identified.  Each
packet sent out is also time stamped.  The time stamp
is returned as part of the ICMP packet so a round trip
delay can be calculated.
<p>

<dt>CAVEATS
<dd>Some IP implementations forward packets with a TTL of
0, thus escaping identification.  Others use the TTL
field in the arriving packet as the TTL for the ICMP
error reply, which delays identification.
<p>

Sending datagrams with the source route option will
cause some gateways to crash.  It is considered poor
form to repeat this behavior.
<p>


<dt>BUGS
<dd>None known.
<p>

<dt>LIMITATIONS
<dd>Most versions of UNIX have errors in the raw IP code
that require kernel mods for the standard version of
traceroute to work.  A version of traceroute exists
that runs without kernel mods under SunOS 3.5 (see
below), but it only operates over an ethernet inter
face.

<dd>TRPT -- transliterate protocol trace
<p>

<dt>KEYWORDS
<dd>traffic; IP; eavesdrop; UNIX; free.
<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>TRPT displays a trace of a TCP socket events.  When no
options are supplied, TRPT prints all the trace records
found in a system, grouped according to TCP connection
protocol control block (PCB).
<p>

An example of TRPT output is:

</pre>
<p>

<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>TRPT interrogates the buffer of TCP trace records that
is created when a TCP socket is marked for debugging.
<p>

<dt>CAVEATS
<dd>Prior to using TRPT, an analyst should take steps to
isolate the problem connection and find the address of
its protocol control blocks.
<p>

<dt>BUGS
<dd>None reported.
<p>


<dt>LIMITATIONS
<dd>A socket must have the debugging option set for TRPT to
operate.  Another problem is that the output format of
TRPT is difficult.

<dt>NAME
<dd>Paramax Network Security Server
<p>

<dt>KEYWORDS
<dd>alarm, control, manager, security, status;
ethernet, FDDI, IP; X; UNIX.
<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>The Paramax Network Security Server (NSS) is a
security officer's tool for centralized security
management of TCP/IP-based networks.  The NSS provides
capability for collection, on-line storage,
maintenance, and correlation of audit data from hosts,
workstations, servers, and network devices.  Through
the X window based user interface, a security officer
can review and analyze this audit data at the NSS,
select and request filtered portions of host audit
data, and receive and analyze security alerts from
across the network.  The NSS supports centralized
access control of network resources through its
capability to create and update user and host access
permissions data.  The user access permissions data
identifies network addresses that each user is
permitted to access.  The host access permissions data
identifies network addresses between which
communication is permitted.  The NSS supports
centralized management of user authentication data
(user IDs and passwords) and other user data for use
by hosts, workstations, and servers in the network.
It generates pseudo-random pronounceable passwords for
selection and assignment to users by the security officer.
<p>

The NSS deadman timer locks the NSS screen or logs the
security officer off the NSS after periods of
inactivity.  A biometric authentication device is
optional for rigorous fingerprint authentication of
users at the NSS, and logins to the NSS itself are
permitted only at the console.  The NSS currently
provides centralized security management for a System High
Network.  It is being upgraded for a Compartmented Mode
environment.
<p>


<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>The NSS uses the Audit Information Transfer Protocol
(AITP) for the transfer of security alerts and audit
data.  AITP is NOT proprietary, and the specification
is available from the address listed below.  Access to
the NSS audit database is provided via the Structured
Query Language (SQL).

<dt>NAME
<dd>Xnetdb
<p>

<dt>KEYWORDS
<dd>database, manager, map, monitoring, status; IP; Ping,
SNMP, Unix, X; free.
<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>Xnetdb is a network monitoring tool based on X Windows
and SNMP which also has integrated database and
statistic viewing capabilities.  Xnetdb will determine
and display the status of routers and circuits it has
been told to monitor by querying the designated sites
and displaying the result.  It can also query the
status of certain designated SNMP variables, such as a
default route for an important router.  Additionally,
it also has integrated database functionality in that
it can display additional information about a site or
circuit such as the equipment at the site, the contact
person(s) for the site, and other useful information.
Finally it can gather designated statistical
information about a circuit and display it on demand.
<p>

<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>Xnetdb uses SNMP or ping to monitor things which its
configured to monitor.  It dynamically builds a
network map on its display by querying entities and
obtaining IP addresses and subnet masks.  A
configuration file tells xnetdb which IP hosts you
want to monitor.
<p>

<dt>CAVEATS
<dd>While "ping" can be used to monitor hosts, more useful
results are obtained using SNMP.
<p>

<dt>BUGS
<dd>Bugs and other assorted topics are discussed on the
xnetdb mailing list.  To join, send a note to
"xnetdb-request@oar.net".
<p>

<dt>LIMITATIONS
<dd>None.
<p>

<dt>HARDWARE REQUIRED
<dd>No restrictions.
<p>


<dt>SOFTWARE REQUIRED
<dd>Most any variety of UNIX plus X-Windows and/or
OpenWindows.
<p>

<dt>AVAILABILITY
<dd>Available via anonymous ftp from ftp.oar.net
(currently 131.187.1.102) in the directory /pub/src.
Special arrangements can be made for sites without
direct IP access by sending a note to
"xnetdb-request@oar.net".  There are minimal licensing
restrictions - these are detailed within the package.

<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>The XNETMON application implements a powerful network
management station based on the X window system.
XNETMON's network management tools for configuration,
performance, security, and fault management have been
used successfully with a wide assortment of wide- and
local-area-network topologies and medias.
Multiprotocol devices are supported
including those using TCP/IP, DECnet, and OSI
protocols.
<p>

Some features of XNETMON's network management tools include:
<p>

o Fault management tool displays a map of the network
configuration with node and link state indicated
in one of several colors to indicate current status;
o Configuration management tool may be used to edit the
network management information base stored in the
NMS to reflect changes occurring in the network;
o Graphs and tabular tools for use in fault and performance
management (e.g. XNETPERFMON);
o Mechanisms by which additional variables, such as vendor
specific variables, may be added;
o Alarms may be enabled to alert the operator of events
occurring in the network;
o Events are logged to disk;
o Output data may be transferred via flat files for
additional report generation by a variety of
statistical packages.
<p>

The XNETMON application comes complete with source
code including a powerful set of portable libraries
for generating and parsing SNMP messages.
<p>


<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>XNETMON is based on the Simple Network Management
Protocol (SNMP).  Polling is performed via the
powerful SNMP get-next operator and the SNMP get
operator.  Trap-directed polling is used to regulate
focus and intensity of the polling.
<p>

<dt>CAVEATS
<dd>None.
<p>

<dt>BUGS
<dd>None known.
<p>

<dt>LIMITATIONS
<dd>Monitored and managed nodes must implement the SNMP over
UDP per RFC 1157 or must be reachable via a proxy agent.
<p>

<dt>HARDWARE REQUIRED

<dt>NAME
<dd>xnetmon, xpmon
<p>

<dt>KEYWORDS
<dd>alarm, manager, map, status; IP; NMS, SNMP; UNIX.
<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>Xnetmon and xpmon provide graphical representation of
performance and status of SNMP-capable network ele
ments.  Xnetmon presents a schematic network map
representing the up/down status of network elements;
xpmon draws a pen plot style graph of the change over
time of any arbitrary MIB object (RFC1066).  Both xnet
mon and xpmon use the SNMP (RFC1098) for retrieving
status and performance data.
<p>

<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>Xnetmon polls network elements for the status of their
interfaces on a controllable polling interval.  Pop-up
windows displaying the values of any MIB variable are
supported by separate polls.  When SNMP traps are
received from a network element, that element and all
adjacent elements are immediately re-polled to update
their status.  The layout of the network map is stati
cally configured.  Xpmon repeatedly polls (using SNMP)
the designated network element for the value of the
designated MIB variable on the user-specified interval.
The change in the variable is then plotted on the strip
chart.  The strip chart regularly adjusts its scale to
the current maximum value on the graph.
<p>

<dt>CAVEATS
<dd>Polling intervals should be chosen with care so as not
to affect system performance adversely.

<p>

<dt>ABSTRACT
<dd>Xnetperfmon is a XNETMON tool used to produce plots of
SNMP variables in graphical displays.  The manager may
easily customize the labels, step size, update interval,
and variables to be plotted to produce graphs for fault
and performance management.  Scales automatically adjust
whenever a point to be plotted would go off scale.
<p>

<dt>MECHANISM
<dd>The xnetperfmon application communicates with remote
agents or proxy agents via the Simple Network Management
Protocol (SNMP).
<p>

<dt>CAVEATS
<dd>All plots for a single invocation of xnetperfmon must be
for variables provided by a single network management
agent.  However, multiple invocations of xnetperfmon may
be active on a single display simultaneously or proxy
agents may be used to summarize information at a common
point.

NFSTRACE
<p>

This is the rpcspy/nfstrace package.
<p>

It is described in detail in the paper "NFS Tracing by Passive
Network Monitoring", which appeared in the January, 1992 USENIX
conference.
<p>

You'll need either a DEC machine running ULTRIX (with the
packetfilter installed in the kernel) or a Sun running SunOS 4.x
(with NIT).  Or you'll need to do a bit of hacking.
<p>

The package differs slightly from the version in the paper:
<p>


- The handle- &gt name translation facility has been removed.  It's
just too fragile to include in the general release.  If you need it,
contact me directly and I'll be happy to mail you the code.
<p>

- The output format is a wee-bit different.
<p>

- The IBM-RT Enet filter version is also not included, since I seem to
be the only person in the world running it.  RTs are really too slow
for this anyway.
<p>

To configure the package, edit the makefile in the obvious (to me at
least) way.
<p>

Note that the not all versions of SunOS NIT have working versions of
the packet timestamp mechanism.  Try to set the -DSTAMPS option in
the makefile, and if that doesn't work, take it out.
<p>

If you are actually going to use this to gather traces, I'd like to
hear from you! Please send email, and share your results/traces if
your organization will allow it.  I maintain a mailing list of users
for updates, etc.  Send me mail to be added to it.
<p>

<br>Happy tracing.

LAMER
<p>
<Pre>

#  Lame delegation notifier
#  Author:  Bryan Beecher
#  Last Modified:   6/25/92
#
#  To make use of this software, you need to be running the
#  University of Michigan release of BIND 4.8.3, or any version
#  of named that supports the LAME_DELEGATION patches posted to
#  USENET.  The U-M release is available via anonymous ftp from
#  terminator.cc.umich.edu:/unix/dns/bind4.8.3.tar.Z.
#
#  You must also have a copy of query(1) and host(1).  These
#  are also available via anonymous ftp in the aforementioned
#  place.
# -------------------------------------------------------------
<p>

# -------------------------------------------------------------
#  handle arguments
# -------------------------------------------------------------
#       -d  &lt day &gt 
#       This flag is used to append a dot-day suffix to the LOGFILE.
#       Handy where log files are kept around for the last week
#       and contain a day suffix.
#
#       -f  &lt logfile &gt 
#       Change the LOGFILE value altogether.
#
#       -w
#       Count up all of the DNS statistics for the whole week.
#
#       -v
#       Be verbose.
#
#       -t
#       Test mode.  Do not send mail to the lame delegation
#       hostmasters.

HOST
<p>

host - look up host names using domain server
<p>
<dl>
<dt>SYNOPSIS
<dd>host [-v] [-a] [-t querytype] [options]  name  [server]
<dd>host [-v] [-a] [-t querytype] [options]  -l domain  [server]
<dd>host [-v] [options]  -H [-D] [-E] [-G] domain
<dd>host [-v] [options]  -C domain
<dd>host [-v] [options]  -A host
<p>

<dt>DESCRIPTION
<dd>host looks for information about Internet hosts or domains.
It gets this information from a set of interconnected
servers that are spread across the world.  By default, it
simply converts between host names and Internet addresses.
However, with the -t, -a and -v options, it can be used to
find all of the information about hosts or domains that is
maintained by the domain nameserver.

PINGs
<p>

Many many versions of the PING program exist.
Each implementation has its own set of additional features.
Here are a few more PINGs that are worth taking a look at.
<p>
<dl>
<dt>Version on ftp.cc.berkeley.edu:pub/ping:
<dd>This version has duplicate packet detection, Record Route,
ability to specify data pattern for packets, flood pinging, an
interval option, Multicast support, etc.
<p>

<dt>Version on nikhefh.nikhef.nl:/pub/network/rping.tar.Z:
<dd>'rping' is just like 'ping', but only a single probe packet
is sent to test the reachability of a destination.
As an option, the loose source routing facility is used
to show the roundtrip route the packet has taken.
Multiple addresses of remote hosts are tried until one
responds. As an option, each of multiple addresses can be
probed unconditionally.
Contains a patch for making loose source routing work in
case you have a SUN with an OMNINET ethernet controller.
</dl>
<p>

<p>

VRFY
<p>
<dl>
<dt>vrfy.tar.Z      (Version 921021)
<dd>'vrfy' is a tool to verify email addresses and mailing lists.
In its simplest form it takes an address "user@domain", figures
out the MX hosts for "domain", and issues the SMTP command VRFY
at the primary MX host (optionally all), or at "domain" itself
if no MX hosts exist. Without "domain" it goes to "localhost".
More complex capabilities are: recursively expanding forward
files or mailing lists, and detecting mail forwarding loops.
Full-blown RFC822 address specifications are understood.
Syntax checking can be carried out either locally or remotely.
Various options are provided to exploit alternative protocol
suites if necessary, and to print many forms of verbose output.
Obvious limitations exist, but on average it works pretty well.
Needless to say you need internet (nameserver and SMTP) access.
See the man page and the extensive documentation in the source
for further details.

XNETLOAD
<p>
<dl>
<dt>NAME
<dd>xnetload - ethernet load average display for X
<p>

<dt>SYNOPSIS
<dd>xnetload[-toolkitoption ...] [-scale integer]
<dd>[-update seconds] [-hl color] [-highlight color]
<dd>[-jumpscroll pixels] [-label string] [-nolabel] host
<p>

<dt>DESCRIPTION
<dd>The xnetload program displays a periodically updating histo
gram  of  the  ethernet load average for the specified host.
The resulting graph is  scaled  as  0%  to  100%,  where  0%
corresponds  to  0mbs  and 100% corresponds to 10mbs.  NOTE:
The specified host must be running rpc.etherd.
</dl>
<p>

This program has been run using X11R4 and X11R5, under the following
operating systems:
<p>

SUNOS 4.1.0
SUNOS 4.1.1
ULTRIX V4.2
IRIX 3.3.2
<p>

Assuming the Imake templates and Rules are in order and in the proper
place on your system, these programs should compile and link
straightforward by running the following sequence:
<p>

<br>        xmkmf
<br>        make
<p>

Then, as root, issue the following:
<p>

<br>        make install
<br>        make install.man
<p>

Then, on your host system, (or on any other system you can rlogin or rsh
into) start the etherd daemon with the following (must be root):
<p>

/usr/etc/rpc.etherd le0  &amp 
<p>

where le0 is the mnemonic for the primary ethernet interface.
<p>

To start the xnetload program, the following command line is suggested:
<p>

./xnetload -hl red host  &amp 
<p>


where "host" is the name of any reachable network node (including
LOCALHOST) that is running the etherd daemon. A small xload window
should appear on your local display with nine horizontal lines. The
label:
"Ethernet Load %"
should appear in the upper left hand corner, just below any additional
title bars or other decorations provided by your window manager. If the
program comes up without the nine lines, or without the "Ethernet Load"
label, then either your resource file is not properly installed in the
appropriate app-defaults directory, or you may have picked up the wrong
xnetload image.  Try re-running "make install" as root, or be sure to
include the "./" in front of the command name.
<p>

Good Luck!
<p>

The following changes have been made to this directory since R3:
<p>

o Now use Athena StripChart widget.
<p>

o Understands WM_DELETE_WINDOW.

NETTEST
<p>

nettest, nettestd - Performs client and server functions for
timing data throughput
<p>

The nettest and nettestd commands invoke client  and  server
programs that are used for timing data throughput of various
methods of interprocess communication.  For TCP and OSI con-
nections,  the nettest program establishes a connection with
the nettestd program, and then it does count writes of  size
bytes,  followed by count reads of size bytes.  For UDP, the
nettest program performs only writes;  reads  are  not  per
formed.  The nettestd program, if used with UDP connections,
reads the data packets and prints a message  for  each  data
packet  it  receives.   The number and size of the reads and
writes may not correlate with the number  and  size  of  the
actual  data packets that are transferred; it depends on the
protocol that is chosen.  If you append an optional k (or K)
to  the  size, count, or bufsize value, the number specified
is multiplied by 1024.
<p>

This source for nettest and nettestd are provided on an "as is"
basis.  Cray Research does not provide any support for this code
(unless you are a customer who has purchased the UNICOS operating
system).
<p>

We will gladly take bug reports for nettest/nettestd.  Suggested
fixes are prefered to just bug reports.  Changes to allow
nettest/nettestd to run on other architectures are also welcomed.  We
will try to incorporate bugfixes and update the publicly available
code, but we can make no guarantees.

Notes:
<p>

<br>   1) The -b option to nettestd has not been tested...
<Br>   2) The ISO code should work on a 4.4BSD system, but the
gethostinfo() routine is specific to UNICOS...

ETHERCK
<p>

etherck is a simple program that displays Sun ethernet statistics.
If you have a high percents of input errors that are due to "out of
buffers", then you can run the "iepatch" script to patch a kernel
that uses the Intel ethernet chip ("ie").  A back of the envelope
calculation shows that a .25% input error rate gives about a 10%
degradation of NFS performance if 8k packets are being used.
<p>

In our environment at Legato, patching the ie buffer allocation made
the input error rate drop more than 2 orders of magnitude.  This was
after we had applied other networking fixes (e.g., using Prestoserve,
going from thin wire to twisted pair) and pushed a higher load on the
server.
<p>

Note that both etherck and iepatch must be run by root (or you can
make etherck setgid kmem).

The following is part of the 'help' file from the Legato Email
Server:
<p>

This message comes to you from the request server at Legato.COM,
request@Legato.COM.  It received a message from you asking for help.
<p>

The request server is a mail-response program.  That means that you
mail it a request, and it mails back the response.
<p>

The request server is a very dumb program.  It does not have much
error checking.  If you don't send it the commands that it
understands, it will just answer "I don't understand you".
<p>

The request server has 4 commands.  Each command must be the first
word on a line.  The request server reads your entire message before
it does anything, so you can have several different commands in a
single message.  The request server treats the "Subject:" header line
just like any other line of the message.  You can use any combination
of upper and lower case letters in the commands.
<p>

The request server's files are organized into a series of directories
and subdirectories.  Each directory has an index, and each
subdirectory has an index.  The top-level index gives you an overview
of what is in the subdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory
tells you what is in it.
<p>


The server has 4 commands:
<p>

"help" command: The command "help" or "send help" causes the server to
send you the help file.  You already know this, of course,
because you are reading the help file.  No other commands are
honored in a message that asks for help (the server figures
that you had better read the help message before you do
anything else).
<p>

SEND a request to Legato to get the rest of the help file!

<p>
NETCK
<p>

netck is a shar file that contains the sources to build "netck", a
network checker that uses the rstat(3R) protocol to gather and print
statistics from machines on the network.  netck is useful to help
understand what part of what machines are potential NFS bottlenecks.
To get this file, send email to the request server with the command
"send unsupported netck".
