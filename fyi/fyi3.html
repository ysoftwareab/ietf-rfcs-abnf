<p>
<h5>1a. Background and Purpose</h5>

<p>
On 1 June 1989, several members of the IETF User Services Working
Group convened an interim working group session at the JVNC
Supercomputer Center in Princeton, NJ.  The purpose of the meeting
was to form a distinct working group that would assemble a
bibliography of useful information about the Internet for end users
and for those who help end users.  The first official meeting of the
User Documents Working Group was held at the Stanford IETF in July
1989.  The goal of the working group was to prepare a bibliography of
on-line and hard copy documents, reference materials, and multimedia
training tools that address general networking information and "how
to use the Internet".  The target audience was beginner level and
intermediate level end users.

<p>
<h5>1b. Scope</h5>

<p>
This bibliography is the result of volunteer work provided by members
of the User Documents Working Group.  The intent of this effort is to
present a representative collection of materials that will help the
reader become familiar with the concepts of internetworking and will
form the basis for future study.  This is, quite simply, a good place
to start.  References to other sources of information within this
collection of materials will be useful to readers who wish to pursue,
in greater depth, the issues and complexities of the current
networking environment.  Please send comments to us-wg@nnsc.nsf.net.

<p>
<h5>1c. Organization of Document</h5>

<p>
This version of the bibliography is divided into 10 distinct
categories of material, and each category is presented in a separate
section:

<p>
2  ARTICLES
<br>3  BIBLIOGRAPHIES
<br>4  BOOKS
<br>5  CONFERENCES AND WORKSHOPS
<br>6  GLOSSARIES
<br>7  GUIDES
<br>8  MULTIMEDIA
<br>9  NEWSLETTERS
<br>10 REPORTS AND PAPERS
<br>11 REQUESTS FOR COMMENTS (RFCs)

<p>
Within each section, material is arranged in alphabetical order by
author or authoring organization with the exception of Section 11:


<p>
REQUESTS FOR COMMENTS (RFCs).  The RFCs are ordered numerically.  All
entries contain fairly standard bibliographic information and provide
a short abstract with information on how to obtain the particular
material addressed.

<p>
For brand new network users, unsure of what to read first, we suggest
reading Ed Krol's, "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Internet" (listed
in the Guide section).  For general information on an introduction to
Internet protocols, two documents are quite useful: Charles
Hedrick's, "Introduction to the Internet Protocols", and Doug Comer's
textbook, "Internetworking with TCP/IP: Principles, Protocols, and
Architecture".  Two excellent guides to existing networks are Tracy
L.  LaQuey's, "Users' Directory of Computer Networks" and John S.
Quarterman's "The Matrix: Computer Networks and Conferencing Systems
Worldwide".  We strongly encourage the reader to scan the
bibliography in its entirety as some items may be more applicable to
personal needs or site requirements.  (Please note that in many
instances the abstracts are excerpts, provided verbatim, from the
material described.)

<p>
<h5>1d. Obtaining Files By Anonymous FTP</h5>

<p>
Much of the material referenced in this bibliography is available
on-line and can be obtained by using the File Transfer Protocol
(FTP).  Directions on how to obtain on-line files by anonymous FTP
action follow.  In this example, the host used is nic.ddn.mil.

<p>
Files may be obtained with the FTP program in conjunction with an
ANONYMOUS login.  Versions of the FTP program may vary from system to
system, so the commands shown in this example may need to be modified
to work on your system.

<p>
<pre>
% ftp nic.ddn.mil   &lt == Use the FTP program to
connect to nic.ddn.mil
Connected to nic.ddn.mil
220 NIC.DDN.MIL FTP Server 5Z(47)-6 at Fri 23-Jun-89 09:38-PDT
</pre>

<p>
The system should respond with a message to indicate that a
connection has been made.  Users on a Unix system will probably be
prompted for a login name.  Type in "anonymous" as in the example
below:

<p>
<pre>
Name (nic.ddn.mil:kbowers): anonymous
331 ANONYMOUS user ok, send real ident as password.
Password:       &lt == Type in  &lt guest &gt  at the password prompt
</pre>

<p>
Other systems may require the use of a "login" or "user" command to
send the username to the server computer.  Users unsure of the
command should contact a local site representative for the specific
commands.

<p>
After the username and password are sent to the system, a message to
indicate that the login has been made successfully should appear:

<p>
<pre>
230 User ANONYMOUS logged in at Fri 23-Jun-89 09:39-PDT, job 17.
</pre>

<p>
The user then connects to the directory in which the document to be
retrieved resides. This is done with the cd command:

<p>

<pre>
ftp &gt  cd RFC:
331 Default name accepted. Send password to connect to it.
</pre>

<p>
The user should now be connected to the RFC: directory.  The "dir" or
"ls" command will list the files available in this directory.

<p>
<pre>
ftp &gt  dir
200 Port 4.124 at host 192.33.33.51 accepted.
150 List started.
*** At this point a list of the files in the directory should appear **
226 Transfer completed.
</pre>

<p>
The "get" command will get any file in the directory.

<p>
<pre>
ftp &gt  get RFC821.TXT
200 Port 4.125 at host 192.33.33.51 accepted.
150 ASCII retrieve of TS &lt RFC &gt RFC.821.TXT.1 (49 pages) started.
226 Transfer completed. 124482 (8) bytes transferred.
local: RFC.821.TXT remote: RFC.821.TXT
124482 bytes received in 55 seconds (2.2 Kbytes/s)
</pre>

<p>
The "quit" command leaves the FTP program.

<p>

<pre>
ftp &gt  quit
221 QUIT command received. Goodbye.
</pre>

<p>

Bell, Gordon, "Gordon Bell Calls for a U.S. Research Network," IEEE
Spectrum, vol. 25, no. 2, pa. 54-57, IEEE Spectrum, New York, NY, Feb 1988.

<p> This article is written by Gordon Bell, the former Chair of the FCCSET
subcommittee on computer networking, infrastructure and digital
communications.  It discusses the merits of a national network and the
potential of such a network to trigger significant advances in computing
and communications research.  The most viable solution is a national
research network organized and maintained by the Federal government.
However, the success of such a venture is tied to the need for effective
leadership in communications and a coordinated Federal science and
technology policy.

<p> LaQuey, Tracy L., "Networks for Academics," Academic Computing, vol.
4, no. 3, pp. 32-39, Academic Computing Publications, Inc., McKinney, TX,
November 1989.

<p> A variety of computer networks serve academic needs at the nation's
campuses.  Their thrusts differ significantly, and it is not uncommon to
find campuses subscribing to multiple networks.  This article is an
overview of the major players.  This November 1989 issue of Academic
Computing also contains other interesting articles on networking.

<p> Markoff, John, "A Supercomputer in Every Pot," New York Times, p. 1,

Communications of the ACM, vol. 29, no. 10, pp. 932-971, Association from
Computing Machinery, Inc., New York, NY, October 1986.

<p> This is a summary of the state of the world of networks as of late
1986.  Although influential in its time and still of historical interest,
it has since been superseded by Quarterman's Book, The Matrix, published in
October 1989.

<p> Quarterman, John S., "Etiquette and Ethics," ConneXions - The
Interoperability Report, vol. 3, no. 4, pp. 12-16, Advanced Computing
Environments, Mountain View, CA, March 1989.

<p> Learning how to use a computer system properly takes much longer than
simply learning the mechanics of making it do things.  Learning to use a
system without offending other users and to maximum benefit involves
etiquette. Learning to use a system without causing harm to others involves
ethics.  These are not completely separable subjects, and the former tends
to blend into the latter as the seriousness of the situation increases.
This article presents a discussion of these subjects, and some suggested
guidelines for appropriate behavior.

<p> Quarterman, John S., "Mail through the Matrix," ConneXions - The
Interoperability Report, vol. 3, no. 2, pp. 10-15, Advanced Computing
Environments, Mountain View, CA, February 1989.

<p> There is a worldwide metanetwork of computer networks that use
dissimilar protocols at the network or internet layer, but that communicate
at the application layer.  The set of such networks that are
non-commercial, e.g., academic, research, or military, is sometimes called
Worldnet.  There are also some commercial networks and conferencing systems
connected, and the metanetwork that includes all of these is what is called
the Matrix.  This article describes some problems associated with
electronic mail correspondence through the Matrix.

821-8380, September 1983.

<p> This article emphasizes how approaches to interconnection, network
access, network services, and protocol functions are related and overlap.
Decisions on which approach to undertake are based on user requirements and
existing specifications.  Applications to TCP/IP and the DDN Internet are
provided.

Stoll, Clifford, The Cuckoo's Egg: Tracking a Spy through the Maze of
Computer Espionage, Doubleday, New York, NY, 1989.

<p>
Clifford Stoll, an astronomer turned UNIX System Administrator,
recounts an exciting, true story of how he tracked a computer
intruder through the maze of American military and research
networks.  This book is easy to understand and can serve as an
interesting introduction to the world of networking.  Jon Postel

proposals developed by the Committee on Computer Research and
Applications of the Federal Coordinating Council for Science,
Engineering and Technology (FCCSET); the utility of the proposed
network to the research community; and developments in computer
technology that might encroach upon the proposed network and
associated services.  The committee's findings with issues and
recommendations are presented in this report.  This document is
available from the Computer Science and Technology Board, 2101

<p>
In response to congressional inquiries and urged on by the
extraordinary opportunities created by rapid developments in
high-performance computing, the Federal Coordinating Council on
Science, Engineering and Technology (FCCSET) recommended that
several federal agencies convene expert panels to assess high-
performance computing.  In attendance were 45 recognized leaders
from industry, academe and national laboratories.  In three
separate sub-panels, they considered the steps necessary to grasp
the opportunities and face the challenges of the next decade: in
particular, to maintain U.S.  leadership in computing technology
and the strengthening of our competitive position vis-a-vis our
trading partners.  The three sub-panel reports follow an executive
summary of the workshop.  For copies, contact Society for

<h4>11. REQUEST FOR COMMENTS (RFC)</h4></a>
<a href="#toc">Return to Table of Contents</a>

<p>
<h5>11.a The Request for Comments Document Series</h5>

<p>
The RFCs are working notes of the Internet research and development
community.  A document in this series may be on essentially any topic
related to computer communication, and may be anything from a meeting
report to the specification of a standard.

<p>
Most RFCs are the descriptions of network protocols or services,
often giving detailed procedures and formats providing the
information necessary for creating implementations.  Other RFCs
report on the results of policy studies or summarize the work of
technical committees or workshops.

<p>
Note: Currently, all standards are published as RFCs, but not all
RFCs specify standards.

<p>
Anyone can submit a document for publication as an RFC.  Submissions
must be made via electronic mail to the RFC Editor.  The RFC Editor
is Jon Postel (Postel@ISI.EDU).

<p>
While RFCs are not refereed publications, they do receive technical
review from either the task forces, individual technical experts, or
the RFC Editor, as appropriate.

<p>
RFCs are distributed on-line by being stored as public access files,
and a short message is sent to the RFC distribution list (RFC-
REQUEST@NIC.DDN.MIL) indicating the availability of the memo.

<p>
The on-line files are copied by the interested people and printed or
displayed at their site on their equipment.  An RFC may also be
returned via email in response to an email query. RFCs can be
obtained via FTP from NIC.DDN.MIL, with the pathname RFC:RFCnnnn.TXT
(where "nnnn" refers to the number of the RFC).  Login with FTP,
username "anonymous", password "guest".

<p>
The DDN Network Information Center (NIC) also provides an automatic
mail service for those sites which cannot use FTP.  Address the
request to SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL and in the subject field of the
message indicate the RFC number, as in "Subject: RFC nnnn".

<p>
RFCs can also be contained via FTP from NIS.NSF.NET.  Using FTP,
login with username "anonymous", and password "guest"; then connect
to the RFC directory (cd RFC).  The file name is of the form
RFCnnnn.TXT-1 (where "nnnn" refers to the number of the RFC).

<p>
The NSFNet Network Information Service (NIS) also provides an
automatic mail service for those sites which cannot use FTP.  Address
the request to NIS-INFO@NIS.NSF.NET and leave the subject field of
the message blank.  The first line of the text of the message must be
"SEND RFCnnnn.TXT-1", where "nnnn" is replaced by the RFC number.
This means that the format of the online files must meet the
constraints of a wide variety of printing and display equipment.

<p>
Once a document is assigned an RFC number and published, that RFC is
never revised or re-issued with the same number.  There is never a
question of having the most recent version of a particular RFC.
However, a protocol (such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP)) may be
improved and re-documented many times in several different RFCs.  It
is important to verify that you have the most recent RFC on a
particular protocol.

<p>
The Internet Activities Board (IAB) published the "IAB Official
Protocol Standards" (currently RFC-1140), which describes the state
of standardization of protocols used in the Internet.  This document
is issued quarterly.  Current copies may be obtained from the DDN
Network Information Center or from the Internet Assigned Numbers
Authority.  Please refer to the latest edition of the "IAB Protocol
Standards" RFC for current information on the state and status of
standard Internet protocols.

<p>
The complete set of all RFCs issued is maintained at, and available
from, the DDN Network Information Center at SRI International.  For
further information, phone: 1-800-235-3155 (E-mail: NIC@NIC.DDN.MIL).
Subsets of this master set (shadow copies) are maintained at MERIT
and CSNET.  Use of the RFC repositories at these sites may be more
suitable to your network connectivity requirements.  Please note,
however, that the NIC.DDN.MIL is the central repository and will
contain the most up-to-date set of RFCs.
