                             Echo Protocol 
                 <draft-yevstifeyev-rfc862bis-echo-01>

Abstract

   This document specifies Echo protocol, that was firstly defined in
   RFC 862.  However that document does not match current Internet
   Standards and specifies Echo protocol for TCP and UDP only, while a
   number of other transport-layer protocols have appeared since the
   time of publication of RFC 862. 

   This document aligns Echo protocol specification with the current
   Internet Standards and specifies Echo protocol for the most wide-
   spread transport-layer protocols.  It obsoletes RFC 347 and RFC 862
   and moves the last to Historic status.

INTERNET DRAFT               Echo Protocol              January 24, 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Echo protocol is a very useful debugging and measurement tool. 
   The echo service simply sends back to the originating source any data
   it receives.

   The first proposal of Echo protocol appeared in RFC 347 [RFC347]. 
   Echo protocol itself was specified in RFC 862 [RFC862].  However this
   document does not match current Internet Standards and specifies Echo
   protocol only for TCP [RFC793] and UDP [RFC768], while a number of
   other transport-layer protocols appeared since the time of 
   publication of RFC 862.  This document aligns the Echo protocol
   specification with current Internet Standards and specifies Echo
   protocol for the most wide-spread transport-layer protocols.  It
   obsoletes RFC 347 [RFC347] and RFC 862 [RFC862] and moves the last to
   Historic status [RFC2026].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

INTERNET DRAFT               Echo Protocol              January 24, 2011


2.  Protocol Specification 

2.1. DCCP Based Echo Protocol

   The Echo protocol supports DCCP [RFC4340] as a lower-layer protocol. 
   If this protocol is used, one DCCP host listens for incoming
   connection on the port TBD1.  Once a DCCP connection is established,
   any data received by this host SHALL be sent back.  This continues
   until the DCCP connection is terminated.

2.2. SCTP Based Echo Protocol

   The Echo protocol supports SCTP [RFC4960] as a lower-layer protocol. 
   If this protocol is used, one SCTP host listens for incoming
   connection on the port TBD2.  Once a SCTP stream connection is
   established, any data received by this host SHALL be sent back.  This
   continues until the SCTP connection is terminated.

2.3. TCP Based Echo Protocol

   The Echo protocol supports TCP [RFC793] as a lower-layer protocol. 
   If this protocol is used, one TCP host listens for incoming
   connection on the port 7.  Once a TCP connection is established, any
   data received by this host SHALL be sent back.  This continues until
   the TCP connection is terminated.

2.4. UDP and UDP-Lite Based Echo Protocol

   The Echo protocol supports UDP [RFC768] and UDP-Lite [RFC3828] as
   lower-layer protocols.  If these protocols are used, one host listens
   for UDP or UDP-Lite datagrams on the port 7.  When a datagram is
   received, the data from it SHALL be sent back in an answering
   datagram.  In the case, when UDP-Lite is used, the checksum MUST
   cover all the packet.

3. Security Considerations

   The Echo protocol is used for debugging purposes and is not believed
   to cause any changes to the security of the Internet. 


4. RFC Editor Considerations

   RFC Editor is asked to mark the following documents as obsoleted by
   this RFC:

   RFC 347 [RFC347]

   RFC 862 [RFC862]

   RFC Editor is also asked to mark RFC 862 [RFC862] as Historic RFC.


5. IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned the DCCP port number TBD1 for use with Echo
   protocol.

   IANA has assigned the SCTP port number TBD2 for use with Echo
   protocol.

   IANA has assigned the TCP port number 7 for use with Echo protocol.

   IANA has assigned the UDP port number 7 for use with Echo protocol.
