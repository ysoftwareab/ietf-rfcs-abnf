                   draft-snell-atompub-inline-00.txt

Abstract

   This specification adds a mechanism to the Atom Syndication Format
   which publishers of Atom Feed and Entry documents can use to embed
   representations of linked resources into a child element of the atom:
   link element.

1.  Introduction

   TBD


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119]

   This specification uses XML Namespaces [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114]
   to uniquely identify XML element names.  It uses the following
   namespace prefix for the indicated namespace URI;

    "atom": "http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"


3.  The 'atom:inline' element

   The atom:inline element MAY be used as the child of an atom:link
   element to embed representations of the resource referenced by the
   containing atom:link.

     inline = element atom:inline {
       atomCommonAttributes,
       attribute type { atomMediaType }?,
       (text|anyElement)*
     }

   The atom:inline element MAY contain a type attribute whose value
   specifies the MIME media type of the representation contained by the
   element.  If the type attribute is not provided, Atom Processors MUST
   behave as though the type attribute were present with a value equal
   to that specified by the containing atom:link elements type
   attribute.  The value of the type attribute MUST NOT be a composite
   type as specified by Section 4.2.6 of [MIMEREG].

   An atom:link element MAY contain any number of atom:inline elements,
   but MUST NOT contain more than one with the same type attribute
   value.

   If the value of the type attribute begins with "text/" (case
   insensitive), the content of atom:inline MUST NOT contain child
   elements.

   If the value of the type attribute is an XML media type [RFC3023] or
   ends with "+xml" or "/xml" (case insensitive), the content of the

   atom:inline element MAY include child elements and SHOULD be suitable
   for handling as the indicated media type.  This would normally mean
   that the atom:inline element would contain a single child element
   that would serve as the root element of the XML document of the
   indicated type.

   For all other values of the type attribute, the content of atom:
   inline MUST be a valid Base64 encoding, as described in [RFC3548],
   section 3.  When decoded, it SHOULD be suitable for handling as the
   indicated media type.  In this case, the characters in the Base64
   encoding MAY be preceded and followed in the atom:inline element by
   white space, and lines are separated by a single newline (U+000A)
   character.

     <feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
        ...
        <entry>
          ...
          <link rel="alternate" type="text/plain" href="example.txt">
            <inline>This is an example</inline>
          </link>
          <link rel="self" type="application/json" href="entry.json">
            <inline>ew0KICAiaWQiOiJodHRwOi8vZXhhbXBsZS5vcm
   cvZm9vIiwNCiAgInRpdGxlIjoiZm9vIg0KfQ==</inline>
          </link>
          ...
        </entry>
        ...
     </feed>

   The atom:inline element MAY have an xml:base attribute
   [W3C.REC-xmlbase-20010627].  When xml:base is used, it serves the
   function described in section 5.1.1 of [RFC3986], establishing the
   base URI (or IRI) for resolving any relative references found within
   the effective scope of the xml:base attribute.

   The atom:inline element MAY have an xml:lang attribute, whose content
   indicates the natural language for the element and its descendents.
   Requirements regarding the content and interpretation of xml:lang are
   specified in XML 1.0 [W3C.REC-xml-20040204], Section 2.12.
