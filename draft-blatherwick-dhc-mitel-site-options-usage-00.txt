Abstract

   This informational document describes Mitel Network's current usage 
   of DHCPv4 options 128 - 135, in order to provide input for the 
   process of reclassifying the DHCPv4 site-specific options range as 
   part of RFC 3942.  This is also intended to complete the process of 
   requesting options 128 - 135 be placed in the "Tentatively Assigned" 
   state by IANA, as described in RFC 3942.

Internet-Draft          Mitel DHCPv4 Vendor Options             May 2005


1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   RFC 3942 reclassifies DHCPv4 options in the range 128 - 223 as 
   "publicly defined", and open to standardization.  Formerly, RFC 2132 
   had defined options in this range as "site-specific", to be used for 
   site-specific needs.  RFC 3942 also defines a process for vendors to 
   publish their current usage of options in the reclassified range, and
   request that these options be placed in "Tentatively Assigned" state 
   by IANA.  

   This document is in response to that process, providing information 
   on Mitel Network's current usage of DHCPv4 options in the range 
   128 - 135 (inclusive), and requests these options be placed in 
   Tentatively Assigned.


3.  Current Usage of DHCPv4 Options 128 - 135

   Mitel Networks currently makes use of DHCPv4 options 128 - 135 
   (inclusive), in the RFC 3942 reclassified range.  Specific usage is 
   given in the table below, along with a brief description of each.  
   All are related to configuration of IP Phones (and similar devices) 
   in a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) environment.  

   Option  Usage
   ======  =====
   128     TFPT Server IP address (for IP Phone-specific software load)
   129     Call Server IP address
   130     Discrimination string (to identify vendor)
   131     Remote statistics server IP address
   132     802.1P VLAN ID
   133     802.1Q L2 Priority
   134     Diffserv Code Point
   135     HTTP Proxy for phone-specific applications


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document describes DHCPv4 options 128 - 135 (inclusive) 
   currently in use by Mitel Networks.  It is requested that IANA place 
   these options in "Tentatively Assigned" state, as described in 
   [RFC3942].

   impact existing security.
