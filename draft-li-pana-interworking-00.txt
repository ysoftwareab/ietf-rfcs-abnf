                    Interworking of PANA and 802.1X
                     draft-li-pana-interworking-00

Abstract

   EAP is a lower layer dependant protocol that has 802.1X and PANA to
   carry it over link layer and network layer respectively. 802.1X
   cannot go through any nodes, while PANA can carry EAP through the
   network over network layer. 802.1X is popular on legacy terminals,
   but it is painful to upgrade all these terminals to support PANA.
   This document introduces a PANA interworking function that enables
   legacy 802.1X terminals get authentication and access to PANA network
   without upgrading its software or hardware.

Internet-Draft              PANA Interworking              November 2009


1.  Introduction

   EAP is a protocol that defines an authentication framework supporting
   multiple authentication methods.  EAP runs between peer and EAP
   server, typically over link layer, e.g.  IEEE 802.  With the effort
   of PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access)
   working group, EAP now may run over network layer per PANA [RFC5191].
   As EAP is a lower-layer dependant protocol, different protocols are
   needed when EAP runs over different lower layers, e.g.
   EAPoL[IEEE802.1X] for EAP over Ethernet and PANA for EAP over IP.

   Clients may used PANA for authentication to access network without
   any link layer authentication method involved.  However, legacy
   terminals may support EAP and EAPoL but not PANA.  One shortcome of
   802.1X is that it could run only on link layer and can't pass through
   any nodes.

   The intent is to define an interworking mechanism between 802.1X and
   PANA, which helps 802.1X terminals get authentication and access to
   PANA network without updating software or hardware of these legacy
   terminals.


2.  Authentication Scenarios and Interworking Function Deployments

   ITU-T Q.3201 [Q.3201] has defined the EAP-based authentication
   architecture in NGN, where link layer authentication, network layer
   authentication as well as an interworking function betweent them are
   required.  Figure 1 depicts such an architecture for broadband
   network.  The PANA-IWF is the function entity supports interworking
   between 802.1X and PANA.  Such function should locate in the device
   where user terminals are directly connected.  Though EAPoL could run
   only over the link between user terminals and the PANA-IWF, EAP could
   be further delivered over IP thanks to PANA.

   Benefits for such an architecture including having a unified
   authentication point for various interfaces, supporting
   authenticating peers indirectly connected to the authenticator.

2.1.  User terminals are directly connected to the access network

   Legacy user terminals supporting 802.1X are directly connected to the
   access network.  The PANA-IWF locates in the access network device
   where user terminals attach. 802.1X runs between user terminals and
   access network device at the edge.  Such access network device is
   generally called Access Node, which typically can be an Ethernet
   switch or a public hot spot in this case.  See Figure 2.

2.2.  User terminals are connected to the network via gateways

   Legacy user terminals supporting 802.1X are connected to the access
   network via gateways.  The PANA-IWF locates in the gateway. 802.1X
   runs between user terminals and the gateway.  This is a typical case

3.  PANA Interworking Function

   PANA Interworking Function (PANA-IWF) is an intermediate between an
   802.1X client and PANA authentication Agent, performs interworking
   between EAPoL and PANA.  PANA-IWF converts EAPoL message from 802.1X
   client into PANA message and forward it to PAA.  It also converts
   PANA message from PAA into EAPoL message and forward it to the
   client.

   For the PAA, PANA-IWF acts as a PaC, maintains PANA state machine and
   responses to PAA's PANA-Auth-Request with PANA-Auth-Answer.  A local
   IP address for the PaC and the IP address of PAA should be configured
   on PANA-IWF beforehand.  PANA-IWF helps exchanging EAP messages
   between the EAPoL client and the PAA in a way of re-encapsulating
   piggybacked EAP message with Ethernet or IP header without touching
   the content of EAP message.

3.1.  Authentication and Authorization with PANA-IWF

   802.1X clients seeking for authentication can reach PAA and get
   authorization for network access via PANA-IWF.

   An example authentication process follows:

   1.  802.1X Client sends EAPoL-Start to PANA-IWF and triggers an EAP
       authentication process.

Internet-Draft              PANA Interworking              November 2009


   2.  PANA-IWF sends a PANA-Client-Initiation to PAA on receiving the
       EAPoL-Start message, and starts negotiatin process with PAA.
   3.  On receiving PANA-Auth-Request with EAP-Payload carried, PANA-IWF
       converts this message into an EAPoL Request message by extracting
       the EAP-Payload and adding link layer information.  EAPoL message
       is then forwarded to 802.1X client.
   4.  802.1X client replies the EAPoL message as normal 802.1X
       authentication process.  PANA-IWF converts this EAPoL message
       from 802.1X client into PANA-Auth-Request message and forward it
       to PAA.  With PANA-IWF's interpretation, 802.1X client talks to
       PAA in EAP and performs authentication process.
   5.  After the client is successfuly authenticated, PAA sends to PANA-
       IWF PANA-Auth-Request with EAP-Success and 'C' bit set.  On one
       hand, PANA-IWF replies PAA a PANA-Auth-Reply with 'C' bit set to
       finish PANA authentication process.  On the other hand, it
       informs 802.1X client that authentication is successful via an
       EAP-Success in EAPoL and finish 802.1X authentication process.

3.2.  Termination Phase with PANA-IWF

   802.1X client may request to terminate the session by sending a
   EAPOL-Logoff message.  PANA-IWF converts the EAPOL-Logoff message
   into PANA-Termination-Request message, which is sent to PAA.  PAA
   replies a PANA-Termination-Answer and clear up the PANA session.


4.  Security Considerations

   802.1X and PANA are both EAP based and inherit security properties
   from EAP and EAP methods.
