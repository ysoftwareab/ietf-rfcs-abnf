                 SR-MPLS / SRv6 Transport Interworking
                  draft-bonica-spring-srv6-end-dtm-06

Abstract

   This document describes procedures for interworking between an SR-
   MPLS transit domain and an SRv6 transit domain.  Each domain contains
   Provider Edge (PE) and Provider (P) routers.  Area Border Routers
   (ABR) provide connectivity between domains.

   The procedures described in this document require the ABR to carry a
   route to each PE router.  However, they do not required the ABR to
   carry service (i.e., customer) routes.  In that respect, these
   procedures resemble L3VPN Interprovider Option C.

   Procedures described in this document support interworking for global
   IPv4 and IPv6 service prefixes.  They do not support interworking for
   VPN services prefixes where the SR-MPLS domain uses MPLS service
   labels.

1.  Overview

   Segment Routing (SR) [RFC8402] allows source nodes to steer packets
   through SR paths.  It can be implemented over IPv6 [RFC8200] or MPLS
   [RFC3031].  When SR is implemented over IPv6, it is called SRv6
   [RFC8986].  When SR is implemented over MPLS, it is called SR-MPLS
   [RFC8660].

   This document describes procedures for interworking between an SR-
   MPLS transit domain and an SRv6 transit domain.  Each domain contains
   Provider Edge (PE) and Provider (P) routers.  Area Border Routers
   (ABR) provide connectivity between domains.

   The procedures described in this document require the ABR to carry a
   route to each PE router.  However, they do not required the ABR to
   carry service (i.e., customer) routes.  In that respect, these
   procedures resemble L3VPN Interprovider Option C [RFC4364].

   Procedures described in this document support interworking for global
   IPv4 and IPv6 service prefixes.  They do not support interworking for
   VPN services prefixes where the SR-MPLS domain uses MPLS service
   labels.

                 Figure 1: Interworking Between SR Domains

   Figure 1 depicts interworking between an SR-MPLS domain and an SRv6
   domain.  The SRv6 domain contains PE Node 1 and P Node 2.  The SR-
   MPLS domain contains P Node 4 and PE node 5.  Both domains contain
   ABR Node 3.

   Nodes 1 and 2 MUST support SRv6 but are NOT REQUIRED to support SR-
   MPLS.  Nodes 4 and 5 MUST support SR-MPLS but are NOT required to
   support SRv6.  Node 3 MUST support both SRv6 and SR-MPLS.  It must
   also support interworking procedures.

   Network operators configure a loopback interface on Nodes 1 through
   5.  These are called Loopback1 through Loopback5.  They also

   configure 2 additional loopback interfaces on PE Node 5.  These are
   called Loopback5.IPv4 and Loopback5.IPv6.

   Each node instantiates an SR Segment (i.e., Segment A through Segment
   E).  SR Path 1 begins on PE Node 1 and ends on PE Node 5.  It visits
   Nodes 2, 3, 4, and 5, executing the instructions associated with
   Segments B, C, and D.  SR Path 2 begins on PE Node 5 and ends on PE
   Node 1.  It visits Nodes 4, 3, 2, and 1, executing the instructions
   associated with Segments D, C, B and A.

                 Figure 2: Encapsulation: SRv6 To SR-MPLS

   Figure 2 depicts the forwarding plane as a packet traverses SR Path
   1, from Node 1 to Node 5.  In this example, PE Node 1 receives an
   IPv4 packet.

   PE Node 1 encapsulates the IPv4 packet in an SRv6 header.  The SRv6
   header contains an IPv6 header and a Segment Routing Header (SRH)
   [RFC8754].  The Destination Address in the IPv6 header is a Segment
   Identifier (SID) that represents Segment B.  Segment B is an END
   instruction instantiated on P Node 2.  The SRH contains a Segments
   Left field and one SID.  The Segments Left field is equal to 1 and
   the SID represents Segment C, and END.DM (Section 4.1) instruction
   instantiated on ABR Node 3.

   PE Node 1 forwards the packet to P Node 2.  When P Node 2 receives
   the packet, it processed the END instruction.  It decrements the
   Segments Left field in the SRH and copies the SID from the SRH to the

   Destination Address field of the IPv6 header.  It then forwards the
   packet to ABR Node 3.

   When ABR Node 3 receives the packet, it processes the END.DM
   instruction.  It removes the SRv6 header and replaces it with an SR-
   MPLS label stack that contains two entries.  The top entry represents
   a prefix SID instantiated on P Node 4.  The bottom entry is an
   Explicit Null instruction (i.e., MPLS label 0), instantiated on PE
   Node 5.

   ABR Node 3 then forwards the packet to P Node 4.  P Node 4 processes
   the prefix SID, removing the top entry from the SR-MPLS label stack
   and forwarding the packet to PE Node 5.  PE Node 5 processes the
   Explicit Null instruction, removing the remaining SR-MPLS label stack
   entry and processing the payload.

   Figure 3 depicts the forwarding plane as a packet traverses SR Path

   IPv4 packet.

   PE Node 5 encapsulates the IPv4 packet in an SR-MPLS label stack that
   contains two entries.  The top entry represents a prefix SID
   instantiated on P Node 4.  The bottom entry is a binding SID
   instantiated on ABR Node 3.

   PE Node 5 then forwards the packet to P Node 4.  P Node 4 processes
   the prefix SID, removing the top entry from the SR-MPLS label stack
   and forwarding the packet to ABR Node 3.  ABR Node 3 processes

   binding SID, removing the remaining SR-MPLS label stack entry and
   replacing it with an SRv6 header.  The SRv6 header contains an IPv6
   header and an SRH.  The Destination Address in the IPv6 header is a
   Segment Identifier (SID) that represents Segment B.  Segment B is an
   END instruction instantiated on P Node 2.  The SRH contains a
   Segments Left field and one SID.  The Segments Left field is equal to
   1 and the SID represents Segment A, an END.DT46 instruction
   instantiated on PE Node 1.  That instruction causes the packet to be
   forwarded using the main IP forwarding table, not a VPN forwarding
   table.

   ABR Node 3 forwards the packet to P Node 2.  When P Node 2 receives
   the packet, it processed the END instruction.  It decrements the
   Segments Left field in the SRH and copies the SID from the SRH to the
   Destination Address field of the IPv6 header.  It then forwards the
   packet to PE Node 1.  PE Node 1 processes its END.DT46 instruction,
   removing the SRv6 header and processing the payload.

4.1.  END.DM Processing

   The End.DM SID MUST be the last segment in a SR Policy.  Its
   arguments are associated with an SR-MPLS label stack.

   When Node N receives a packet destined to S and S is a locally
   instantiated End.DM SID, Node N executes the following procedure:

   S01. When an IPv6 Routing Header is processed {
   S02.   If (Segments Left != 0) {
   S03.      Send an ICMP Parameter Problem to the Source Address,
                Code 0 (Erroneous header field encountered),
                Pointer set to the Segments Left field,
                interrupt packet processing and discard the packet.
   S04.   }
   S05.   Proceed to process the next header in the packet
   S06. }


   When processing the Upper-layer header of a packet matching a FIB
   entry locally instantiated as an End.DM SID, N executes the following
   procedure:

   S01. Decapsulate the packet (i.e., remove the outer IPv6 Header and all
        its extension headers)
   S02. Push the SR-MPLS label stack that is associated with the END.DM
        arguments. Set the MPLS Traffic Class and TTL values to reflect
        the Traffic Class and Hop count values received in the IPv6 header.
   S03. Submit the packet to the MPLS FIB lookup for transmission to the
        new destination

                        Figure 4: BGP NLRI Exchange

   In the Figure 4, PE Node 1 and PE Node 5 exchange customer Network
   Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) [RFC4271] using either a direct
   BGP session or a route reflector [RFC4456].  All customer routes
   exchanged between PE Node 1 and PE Node 5 belong to the general
   routing instance.  They cannot belong to a VPN.

   PE Node 1 exchanges loopback routes with ABR Node 3, using either a
   direct BGP session or a route reflector.  Likewise, ABR Node 3
   exchanges loopback with PE Node 5, using either a direct BGP session
   or a route reflector.

   PE Node 1 and ABR Node 3 bind SIDs to the loopback routes that they
   exchange, as described in [I-D.dawra-bess-srv6-services].  PE Node 5
   and ABR Node 3 bind labels to the loopback routes that they exchange,
   as described in [RFC8277].

   Both domains use an IGP to distribute link state information and
   establish connectivity within the domain.

5.1.  Signaling SR Paths That Originate In The SRv6 Domain

   PE Node 5 advertises an IPv4 customer route to PE Node 1 using BGP as
   follows:

   o  IPv4 Prefix

   o  Next-hop: Loopback5.IPv4

   This causes PE Node 1 to resolve the customer route through its route
   to Loopback5.IPv4.  The following paragraphs describe how PE Node 1
   acquires a route to Loopback5.IPv4.

Internet-Draft          SR-MPLS/SRv6 Interworking              July 2021


   PE Node 5 advertises Loopback5.IPv4 to ABR Node 3 using BGP Labeled
   Unicast (BGP-LU) as follows:

   o  Prefix: Loopback5.IPv4

   o  Next-hop: Loopback5

   o  Color Community: Color to distinguish between paths between ABR
      Node 3 and PE Node 5

   o  MPLS Label: Explicit Null (0)

   Now, ABR Node 3 resolves its route to Loopback5.IPv4 through its IGP
   route to Loopback5.  Therefore, when forwarding traffic bound for
   Loopback5.IPv4, it imposes:

   o  An SR-MPLS label stack associated with the IGP route to Loopback5

   o  An additional Explicit Null label

   ABR Node 3 advertises Loopback5.IPv4 to PE Node 1 using BGP as
   follows:

   o  Prefix: Loopback5.IPv4

   o  Next-hop: Loopback3

   o  Color Community: Color to distinguish between paths between ABR
      Node 3 and PE Node 1

   o  SID: SID C (i.e., an END.DM SID instantiated on ABR Node 3)

   Now, PE Node 1 resolves its route to Loopback5.IPv4 through its IGP
   route to Loopback3.  Therefore, when forwarding traffic bound for
   Loopback5.IPv4, it imposes an SRv6 header that includes the following
   SIDs:

   o  SIDS associated with the IGP route to Loopback3

   o  SID C

5.2.  Signaling SR Paths That Originate In The SR-MPLS Domain

   PE Node 1 advertises an IPv4 customer route to PE Node 5 using BGP as
   follows:

   o  IPv4 Prefix

   o  Next-hop: Loopback1

   This causes PE Node 5 to resolve the customer route through its route
   to Loopback1.  The following paragraphs describe how PE Node 5
   acquires a route to Loopback1.

   PE Node 1 advertises Loopback1 to ABR Node 3 using BGP as follows:

   o  Prefix: Loopback1

   o  Next-hop: Loopback1

   o  Color Community: Color to distinguish between paths between ABR
      Node 3 and PE Node 1

   o  SID: SID A (i.e., An END.DT46 SID instantiation on PE Node 1.
      This instruction causes a packet to be forwarded using the main IP
      forwarding table, not a VPN forwarding table.)

   Now, ABR Node 3 resolves its route to Loopback1 through its IGP route
   to Loopback1.  Therefore, when forwarding traffic bound for
   Loopback1, it imposes an SRv6 header that includes:

   o  SIDS associated with the IGP route to Loopback1

   o  SID A

   ABR Node 3 advertises Loopback1 to PE Node 5 using BGP-LU as follows:

   o  Prefix: Loopback1

   o  Next-hop: Loopback3

   o  Color Community: Color to distinguish between paths between ABR
      Node 3 and PE Node 5

   o  MPLS Label: A binding label that represents the SRv6 path between
      ABR Node 3 and PE Node 5

   Now, PE Node 5 resolves its route to Loopback1 through its IGP route
   to Loopback3.  Therefore, when forwarding traffic bound for
   Loopback1, it imposes:

   o  An SR-MPLS label stack associated with the IGP route to ABR3

   o  An additional label representing a binding SID.  The binding SID

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA action.

   The authors will request an early allocation from the "SRv6 Endpoint
   Behaviors" sub-registry of the "Segment Routing Parameters" registry.

7.  Security Considerations

   Because SR inter-working requires co-operation between inter-working
   domains, this document introduces no security consideration beyond
   those addressed in [RFC8402], [RFC8754] and [RFC8986].

8.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Melchior Aelmans, Takuya Miyasaka and Jeff Tantsura for
   their comments.
