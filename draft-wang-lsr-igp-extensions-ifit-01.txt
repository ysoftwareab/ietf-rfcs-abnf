IGP Extensions for In-situ Flow Information Telemetry (IFIT) Capability
                             Advertisement
                 draft-wang-lsr-igp-extensions-ifit-01

Abstract

   This document extends Node and Link Attribute TLVs to Interior
   Gateway Protocols (IGP) to advertise supported In-situ Flow
   Information Telemetry (IFIT) capabilities at node and/or link
   granularity.  An ingress router cannot insert IFIT-Data-Fields for
   packets going into a path unless an egress router has indicated via
   signaling that it has the capability to process IFIT-Data-Fields.  In
   addition, such advertisements would be useful for ingress routers to
   gather each router's IFIT capability for achieving the computation of
   Traffic Engineering (TE) paths or loose TE paths that be able to
   fulfill the visibility of on-path OAM data.

1.  Introduction

   IFIT provides a high-level framework and a reflection-loop solution
   for on-path telemetry [I-D.song-opsawg-ifit-framework].  At present,
   there is a family of emerging on-path telemetry techniques, including
   In-situ OAM (IOAM) [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data], IOAM Direct Export

   (DEX) [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-direct-export], Enhanced Alternate Marking
   (EAM) [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-alt-mark], etc.

   IFIT is a solution focusing on network domains.  The "network domain"
   consists of a set of network devices or entities within a single
   Autonomous System (AS).  The part of the network which employs IFIT
   is referred to as the IFIT domain.  One network domain may consist of
   multiple IFIT domains.  An IFIT domain may cross multiple network
   domains.  The family of emerging on-path telemetry techniques may be
   partially enabled in different vendors' devices as an emerging
   feature for various use cases of application-aware network
   operations.  So that in order to dynamically enable IFIT
   functionality in a network domain, it is necessary to advertise the
   information of IFIT option types supported in each device.

   An ingress router cannot insert IFIT-Data-Fields for packets going
   into a path unless an egress router has indicated via signaling that
   it has the capability to process IFIT-Data-Fields.  In addition, such
   advertisements would be useful for ingress routers to gather each
   router's IFIT capability for achieving the computation of TE paths or
   loose TE paths that be able to fulfill the visibility of on-path OAM
   data.

   BGP-LS defines a way to advertise topology and associated attributes
   and capabilities of the nodes in that topology to a centralized
   controller [RFC7752].  Typically, BGP-LS is configured on a small
   number of nodes that do not necessarily act as head-ends.  In order
   for BGP-LS to signal IFIT node capabilities for all the devices in
   the network, IFIT node capabilities SHOULD be advertised by every IGP
   router in the network.

   This document defines a mechanism to signal the supported IFIT
   capabilities at node and/or link granularity using IS-IS, OSPFv2 and
   OSPFv3.

2.  Terminology

   Following are abbreviations used in this document:

   o  BGP-LS: Border Gateway Protocol - Link State

   o  IS-IS: Intermediate System to Intermediate System

   o  OSPF: Open Shortest Path First

   o  IFIT: In-situ Flow Information Telemetry

   o  TE: Traffic Engineering

   o  IOAM: In-situ OAM

   o  PBT: Postcard-Based Telemetry

   o  DEX: IOAM Direct Export

   o  EAM: Enhanced Alternate Marking

   o  IGP: Interior Gateway Protocols

   o  AS: Autonomous System

   o  E2E: Edge-to-Edge

   o  NLRI: Network Layer Reachability Information

3.  IFIT Capability

   Each IFIT-capable node is configured with a node-id which uniquely
   identifies a node within the associated IFIT domain.  To accommodate
   the different use cases or requirements of in-situ flow information
   telemetry, IFIT data fields updated by network nodes fall into
   different categories which are referred as different IFIT option
   types, including IOAM Trace Option-Types [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data],
   IOAM Edge-to-Edge (E2E) Option-Type [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data], IOAM
   DEX Option-Type [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-direct-export] and EAM Option-
   Type [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-alt-mark].  A subset or all the IFIT-Option-
   Types and their corresponding IFIT-Data-Fields can be associated to
   an IFIT-Namespace.  Namespace identifiers allow a device which is
   IFIT-capable to determine whether IFIT-Option-Types need to be
   processed.  So that IFIT-Option-Types and Namespace-IDs SHOULD be
   included in IFIT capability information.

   This document defines the IFIT Capability information formed of one
   or more pairs of a 2-octet Namespace-ID and 16-bit Option-Type Flag.

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   o  Namespace-ID: A 2-octet identifier, which must be present and
      populated in all IFIT-Option-Types.  The definition is the same as
      described in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

   o  Option-Type Flag: A 16-bit bitmap, which is defined as:

        +-------------------------------+

   Where:

   o  p-Flag: IOAM Pre-allocated Trace Option Type flag.  When set, this
      indicates that the router is capable of IOAM Pre-allocated Trace
      [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

   o  i-Flag: IOAM Incremental Trace Option Type flag.  When set, this
      indicates that the router is capable of IOAM Incremental Tracing
      [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

   o  d-Flag: IOAM DEX Option Type flag.  When set, this indicates that
      the router is capable of IOAM DEX
      [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-direct-export].

   o  e-Flag: IOAM E2E Option Type flag.  When set, this indicates that
      the router is capable of IOAM E2E processing
      [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

   o  m-Flag: EAM flag.  When set, this indicates that the router is
      capable of processing Enhanced Alternative Marking packets
      [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-alt-mark].

   o  Reserved: Must be set to zero upon transmission and ignored upon
      receipt.

   An IFIT node MAY be capable of more than one IFIT option types.  In
   this case, Option-Type Flag can has more than one bit being set.

   In this document, Link IFIT Capability is defined as the supported
   IFIT-Option-Types of the interface associated with the link.  When
   all interfaces associated with links support the same IFIT-Option-
   Type, the Node IFIT Capability SHOULD represent the Link IFIT
   Capability.  Both of Node and Link IFIT Capability information are
   formed of one or more pairs of Namespace-ID and Option-Type Flag.

   When both of Node and Link IFIT Capability are advertised, the Link
   IFIT Capability information MUST take precedence over the Node IFIT

   Capability.  Besides, when a Link IFIT Capability is not signaled,
   then the Node IFIT Capability SHOULD be considered to be the IFIT
   Capability for this link.

4.  Signaling IFIT Capability Using IS-IS

   The IS-IS Extensions for advertising Router Information TLV named IS-
   IS Router CAPABILITY TLV [RFC7981], which allows a router to announce
   its capabilities within an IS-IS level or the entire routing domain.
   And [RFC5305] describes extensions to IS-IS to support Traffic
   Engineering.

4.1.  IS-IS Node IFIT Sub-TLV

   According to the format of IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV [RFC7981], the
   Node IFIT sub-TLV within the body of the IS-IS router CAPABILITY TLV
   is composed of three fields, a one-octet Type field, a one-octet
   Length field, and a multiple of 4-octet Value field.  The following
   format is used:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   Where:

   o  Type: To be assigned by IANA

   o  Length: A one-octet field that indicates the length of the value
      portion in octets.

   o  Node-IFIT-Capability: A multiple of 4-octet field, which is same
      as defined in Section 3.

4.2.  IS-IS Link IFIT Sub-TLV

   The Link IFIT sub-TLV is defined to carry the IFIT-Capability
   information of the interface associated with the link, which is
   formed of three fields, a one-octet Type field, a one-octet Length
   field, and a multiple of 4-octet Value field.  The following format
   is used:

      portion in octets.

   o  Link-IFIT-Capability: A multiple of 4-octet field, which is same
      as defined in Section 3.

5.  Signaling IFIT Capability Using OSPF

   Given that OSPF uses the options field in LSAs and hello packets to
   advertise optional router capabilities [RFC7770], this document
   defines a new IFIT Node TLV within the body of the OSPF RI Opaque LSA
   [RFC7770] to carry the IFIT Capabilities of the router originating
   the RI LSA.

   This document defines the Link IFIT sub-TLV to carry the IFIT-
   Capability information of the interface associated with the link.
   For OSPFv2, the link-level IFIT capability information is advertised
   as a sub-TLV of the OSPFv2 Extended Link TLV as defined in [RFC7684].
   For OSPFv3, the link-level IFIT capability information is advertised
   a sub-TLV of the E-Router-LSA TLV as defined in [RFC8362].

5.1.  OSPF Node IFIT TLV

   The Node IFIT TLV is composed of three fields, a 2-octet Type field,
   a 2-octet Length field, and a multiple of 4-octet Value field.  The
   following format is used:

   The Link IFIT sub-TLV encoded in the OSPFv2 Extended Link TLV is
   constructed of three fields, a 2-octet Type field, a 2-octet Length
   field, and a multiple of 4-octet Value field.  The following format
   is used:

                      Fig. 6 OSPFv3 Link IFIT sub-TLV

   Where:

   o  Type: To be assigned by IANA

   o  Length: A 2-octet field that indicates the length of the value
      field.

   o  Link-IFIT-Capability: A multiple of 4-octet field, which is as
      defined in Section 3.

6.  Application

   As any packet with IFIT-Data-Fields must not leak out from the IFIT
   domain, the IFIT decapsulating node must be able to capture packets
   with IFIT-specific header and metadata and recover their format
   before forwarding them out of the IFIT domain.  Thus, an ingress
   router cannot insert IFIT-Data-Fields for packets going into a path
   unless an egress router has indicated via signaling that it has the
   capability to process IFIT-Data-Fields.  In this case, such
   advertisements are helpful for avoiding the leak of IFIT-specific
   header and metadata.

   In addition, such advertisements would be useful for ingress routers
   to gather each router's IFIT capability for achieving the computation
   of TE paths or loose TE paths that be able to fulfill the visibility
   of on-path OAM data.  For example, for achieving the computation of

   low-latency SR-TE path, latency is expected to be collected at every
   node that a packet traverses to ensure performance visibility into
   the entire path.  IOAM Trace Option-Types is a desired option to have
   a hop-by-hop latency measurement.  If not all nodes on this path are
   IOAM Trace Option-Type capable, an incomplete measurement can have
   negative impacts on SR-TE path computation and adjustment for low-
   latency assurance.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate values for the following new TLV and
   sub-TLVs.

                    +------+-------------------------+
                    | Type | Description             |
                    +------+-------------------------+
                    | TBD  | IS-IS Node IFIT Sub-TLV |
                    | TBD  | IS-IS Link IFIT Sub-TLV |
                    +------+-------------------------+

              +------+-------------------------------------+
              | Type | Description                         |
              +------+-------------------------------------+
              | TBD  | OSPF Node IFIT Capability TLV       |
              | TBD  | OSPFv2 Link IFIT Capability sub-TLV |
              | TBD  | OSPFv3 Link IFIT Capability sub-TLV |
              +------+-------------------------------------+

8.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces new IGP Node and Link Attribute TLVs and
   sub-TLVs for the IFIT Capability advertisements at node and/or link
   granularity.  It does not introduce any new security risks to IS-IS,
   OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.
