1. Introduction

The purpose of this Internet Draft is to start discussion on the 
issues involved in interconnecting Internet and Public Switched 
Networks so as to provide more effective media than either 
network type can do presently. Interworking of the Internet and 
PSTNs, based on open well-defined interfaces, will promote 
interoperability of both the networks and systems built by 
different vendors.

This Internet Draft specifically proposes a type of 
interconnection that involves only an Internet application, the 
TCP/IP suite being the only transport means considered. Although 
many such types of interconnections are possible, only one is 
considered here--the one based on the architectural concept 
(introduced later in this document) called the Intelligent 
Network (IN). IN has been standardized internationally by the 
International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications 
Standardization Sector (ITU-T) and is being widely implemented 
in the telecommunications networks around the world.

Still, even when restricted to IN, several interconnection 
choices can be made. Again, to narrow the subject of discussion,

A Proposal for Internet and PSTN Internetworking                 March 1997

this proposal makes one choice. To this end, the document 
outlines specific interfaces between Internet and IN and 
proposes the method to carry out the work. The proposal makes it 
clear which interfaces are to be standardized by IETF and which 
are to be standardized by ITU-T; since both sets of interfaces 
are mutually exclusive in that respect, there is only a minimal 
need for coordination between the two bodies. The proposal 
addresses the coordination issues.

The rest of this document is as follows:

Section 2 briefly describes the services offered to the end 
user. It is the support of these services that necessitates the 
proposed internetworking project.

Section 3 describes the scope of the proposed project by 
introducing its overall architecture, identifying the interfaces 
to be standardized, and suggesting the coordination steps that 
need to be taken to ensure consistent results of standardization 
should it be undertaken by both IETF and ITU.

Sections 4, 5, and 6 respectively address security 
considerations, supply references, and provide the authors 
address, as required by [1]. 

Section 7 is the Appendix, which contains the figures (available 
only in the PostScript format).

2.	Service Description

The common denominator of the services introduced in this 
section is bringing telephone services (provided by PSTNs) to 
Internet users.  Successful interworking of the Internet and 
Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) should enable 
integration of PSTN services (e.g., a telephone call) with those 
offered by the Internet through the World-Wide Web. Examples of 
such services are Click-to-Dial, Click-to-Fax, Click-to-Fax-Back,
and Voice access to content, and they can be briefly described as follows: 

  With the Click-to-Dial service, a Web user can initiate 
a PSTN call by clicking a button during a Web session. 
Such a call can be either incoming or outgoing. (An 
example of the former is when a user, while browsing 
through a catalogue, clicks the button inviting a sales 
representative to call him or her.)

  With the Click-to-Fax service, a Web user can send 
a fax by clicking a button during a Web session.

  With the Click-to-Fax-Back service, a Web user can request 
(and subsequently receive) a fax by clicking a button 
during a Web session.

  With the Voice-access-to-content service, a Web user can 
have access to the Web content by telephone. The content 
is converted to speech and transmitted to the user on a 
telephone line.

3.	Scope of the Proposed Project

A somewhat general view of the proposed project is presented in 
Figure A of the Appendix. The figure distinguishes the two types 
of end-users: 1) the Web users, whose PCs (or other Internet 
access devices) are connected to the Internet, and 2) the 
telephone users, whose telephones or fax machines are connected 
to PSTNs. In this context, the proposed internetworking involves 
interconnection of Internet service providers and network 
operators (who own PSTNs).

In order to proceed with a more specific definition, this 
document introduces the concept of Intelligent Network (IN) in 
the next subsection. The subsections that follow respectively 
outline the overall architecture, identify the interfaces 
relevant to the project, demonstrate the involvement of the 
interfaces in the function of the Click-to-Dial service, and 
propose the steps necessary for carrying out the work.

3a.	Intelligent Network (IN)

IN ([2], [3]) is an architectural concept that provides for the 
real-time execution of network services and customer 
applications in a distributed environment consisting of 
interconnected computers and switching systems. Also included in 
the scope of IN are systems and technologies required for the 
creation and management of services in this distributed 
environment.

In PSTNs, user's telephone terminals and fax machines are 
connected to telephone switches. The switches (which can be 
Central Offices--for wireline communications and Mobile 
Switching Centers (MSCs)--for wireless communications) are specialized 
computers engineered for provision of services to the users. The 
switches themselves are interconnected in two ways: 1) through 
trunks on which the voice is carried and 2) through a 
specialized fault-tolerant data communications network, which is 
(principally) used for call setup and maintenance. This network 
is called (after the ITU-T standard protocol suite that it uses) 
Signalling System No. 7 (SS7). In addition, the switches are 
connected to general purpose computers that support specialized 
applications (called Operations Systems) whose role includes 
network management, administrative functions (e.g., billing), 
maintenance, etc. Operation systems are not connected to the 
switches through the SS7 network, which is, again, engineered 
only for set-up and real time maintenance of calls. In most 
cases, X.25 protocol is used for communications between 
operations systems and switches.

I. Faynberg, M. Krishnaswamy, and H. Lu		                  [Page 3]

A Proposal for Internet and PSTN Internetworking                 March 1997

Even a simple two-party call in most cases involves several 
switches, which may also be located in different PSTNs. To this 
end, the switches alone comprise a complex distributed 
processing environment. As far as the end users are concerned, 
the switches are ultimately responsible for delivering 
telecommunications services. Certain elementary services (such 
as provision of the dial tone, ringing the called line, and 
establishing a connection between two users) are called basic 
services, and all switches can presently cooperate in delivering 
them to end users. 

In addition, a multitude of services (such as Freephone [a.k.a. 
800 number in North America], Conference Calling, Call 
Forwarding, and many others) require much more than basic call 
processing. Such services are called Supplementary Services, and 
their implementation requires that specialized applications 
(called Service Logic) be developed. Developing switch-based 
service logic for each supplementary service would be an 
extremely expensive (if at all possible) task, which--in the 
presence of multiple switch vendors--would also require an 
extensive standardization effort.

The IN architecture is the alternative which, in a nutshell, 
postulates using a network-wide server (called Service Control 
Function [SCF]). The SCF executes service logic and instructs 
the switches on how to complete the call. A switch is involved 
only in executing the basic call process, which is interrupted 
(at standardized breakpoints called triggers) when specialized 
service logic needs be executed. On encountering such a 
breakpoint, the switch issues a query to the SCF and waits for 
its instruction. In addition (and this is essential for 
supporting the services described in section 2), the SCF may 
initiate a call on its own by instructing switches to establish 
necessary connections among themselves and to the call parties.

Physically, the SCF may be located in either stand-alone general 
purpose computers called Service Control Points (SCPs) or 
specialized pieces of equipment called Service Nodes (SNs). In 
addition to executing service logic, a service node can perform 
certain switching functions (such as bridging of calls)as well 
as a set of specialized functions (such as playing 
announcements, voice recognition and text-to-speech conversion). 

An important distinction between an SCP and SN is that the 
former is connected to switches via the SS7 network while the 
latter communicates with the switch via Integrated Services 
Digital Network (ISDN) Primary or Basic Rate Interfaces (PRI or 
BRI), which combine both the signaling and voice paths.
With the present state of IN standardization, in principle, 
either an SCP or SN could be connected to an Internet server in 
order to support the services outlined in section two. To 
further narrow the scope of work so as to produce tangible 
results as soon as possible, the proposed project specifically 
addresses only interconnection between a server and SN.

A Proposal for Internet and PSTN Internetworking                 March 1997

Within the IN architecture, the relevant administration of the 
network entities (i.e., setting the triggers in the switches, 
transferring externally developed service logic to SCPs and SNs, 
and maintaining the network databases with the customer-related 
data) is performed by a specialize Operation System called 
Service Management System (SMS).

3b.	Overall Architecture 

Figure B demonstrates the overall architecture addressed by the 
proposed project. This figure may also serve as an illustration 
to the IN discussion of the previous subsection.
The PSTN users are depicted connected to both the central office 
via wireline and mobile switching center via wireless 
communications. The IN entities that contain the Service Control 
Function (i.e., the SN and SCP) are shown with their respective 
interfaces to, first of all, the switches. Specifically, the 
ISDN-based interfaces from the SN to the MSC and center office 
are respectively marked I and C; the SS7-based interfaces from 
the SCP to the MSC and center office are respectively marked F 
and G. (The latter two interfaces are depicted with the dotted 
line because they are not within the scope of the proposed 
project). Finally, the SMS is depicted together with its 
respective interfaces to the SN (D) and SCP (H). (Again, the 
interface H is depicted with the dotted line because it is not 
within the scope of the project.)

On the Internet side, Figure B exhibits a Web user connected to 
the Web server. As far as the proposed project is concerned, the 
server has two interfaces: interface A to the SN and interface B 
to the SMS. (As before, a feasible, but not considered within 
the scope of the project, interface E to the SCP is depicted 
using the dotted line.) It is proposed that the A interface be 
based on TCP/IP, and the B interface, on Simple Network 
Management Protocol (SNMP).

3c.	Interfaces Relevant to the Project

With the present proposal, the interfaces that are relevant to 
the project are A, B, D, I, and C.

The interfaces between the SN and switches (interfaces I and C), 
as well as the interface between the SN and SMS have been 
studied in ITU-T Study Group 11; the interfaces between the Web 
server and SN (interface A) and Web Server and SMS (interface B) 
are proposed for standardization within the IETF.

The following subsection presents an example Click-to-Dial 
service scenario, which should give an idea of how the 
interfaces are used.

3d.	A Click-To-Dial Service Scenario

For the purposes of this discussion, it is assumed that the Web 
user exemplified here has telephone access while using the Web 
(this can be achieved, for example, by having an ISDN 
connection). We find this Web user in the act of browsing 
through a sales catalogue and deciding to speak to a sales 
representative.

When the Web user clicks a button inviting a telephone call from 
the sales office, the Web server sends a message to the SN over 
the A interface, thus crossing the Internet-to-PSTN boundary. By 
matching the information received from the Web server with the 
user profile that had been previously loaded and activated by 
the SMS over the D interface, the SN recognizes the signal.

At this point, the SN invokes service logic as indicated in the 
profile. The execution of this logic selects an appropriate 
sales person to call based on the time of the day. It is 8 P.M. 
in New York where the Web user is located, and the New York 
sales office has been closed. But the San Francisco office is 
still open, and so the SN selects an appropriate central office, 
establishes the connection (the interface C) to this central 
office, verifies that there is at least one sales agent line 
that is free, instructs the switch to establish a two-party call 
between the sales agent and the Web user, and--quite 
importantly--instructs the switch to charge the call to the Web 
content provider.

3e.	On Carrying Out the Work

The interfaces relevant to the project fall into two classes:

1) the A and B interfaces, and 

2) the  C, D, and I interfaces. 

ITU-T SG 11 will continue the work on the second class of the 
interfaces. It is proposed that the IETF start the work on the 
first class. 

Naturally, coordination would be required to ensure that the 
data exchanged over the A and B interfaces are consistent with 
those exchanged over the rest of the interfaces. Furthermore, 
the amount and rate of delivery of data over any of the 
interfaces involved should be consistent with what both PSTNs 
and the Internet may support without jeopardizing the overall 
network performance of either network. The security 
considerations are discussed in a separate section of this 
document as required by [1].

It is proposed that the coordination be achieved by exchanging 
information between the IETF and ITU-T on the progress of the 
standardization efforts in the respective organizations. The

A Proposal for Internet and PSTN Internetworking                 March 1997

authors of this proposal (who participate in both organizations) 
volunteer to ensure that such information be exchanged properly 
and efficiently.

The authors also volunteer to deliver a tutorial on the 
Intelligent Network standards to members of the IETF who may be 
interested in participating in the proposed project.

4.  Security Considerations

Internetworking of the Internet and PSTN necessitates the 
introduction of new interfaces, i.e., the A and B interfaces 
described in the previous sections. To ensure that their use 
does not put the networks at additional security risk, these 
interfaces should be designed to meet the basic security 
requirements such as follows:

	+Peer entity authentication to allow a communicating entity 
	to prove its identity to another in the network. Two types of
	peers should be recognized for the purposes of this project:
	end-user and the Web server, and Web server and SN. 

	Between the end-user and Web server the authentication could be 
	accomplished by means of the user name and password combination. 
	In addition, encrypted communications could be used in this case.

	Same could be used between the Web server and SN, but it is proposed
	that additional security be accomplished by replicating a part of the
	server's data base relevant to the business providing the service.

 	+Non-repudiation to account for all operations in case of 
	doubt or dispute. This could be achieved by logging all the
        information pertinent to the Web transaction. In addition, the
        PSTN network will maintain its own account of the transaction for
        generating bills.

  	+Confidentiality to avoid disclosure of information without 
	 the permission of its owner. Although this is an essential
         requirement, it is not particular to the proposed project.

  	+End-user profile verification to verify if the end user is 
         authorised to use a service.

 Of course, in the course of the project execution, additional 
requirements are likely to arise and many more specific security work 
items are likely to be proposed and implemented.
