NAME = ôNameö ô:ö text-UTF8 
          A message may have a context.  This can be viewed as the 
          subject of the message.  The name does not have to be unique 
          in a given topic.  The name is free formed but shall be 
          limited to one line of no more than 128 characters.  The NAME 
          attribute is OPTIONAL. 
        
PRIORITY = ( ôPriorityö | ôPriö ) ô:ö positive-number 
          PRIORITY is a numeric value greater than zero that can 
          OPTIONALLY define the priority of the message in the topicÆs 
          queue.  Messages are normally processed FIFO in a topicÆs 
          queue.  Messages that define a priority are organized so that 
          lower priority numbers are sent before higher priority 
          numbers (priority of 2 is sent before a priority of 10). 
        
CREATED = ( ôCreatedö ) ô:ö date-time 
          CREATED is the REQUIRED date/time the message was created, 
          just prior to being streamed to the server.  The date/time is 
          REQUIRED to be based on GMT (Zulu) zone and seconds are 
          expressed in fractions of a second. The CREATED date/time MAY 
          be used by the subscriber to verify the ordering of messages 
          received. 
        
RECEIPT = ôReceiptö ô:ö boolean 
          RECEIPT is an OPTIONAL, Boolean attribute that informs the 
          server to return a message to the publisher that the message 
          was successfully delivered to at least one subscriber.  The 
          values of the attribute are either YES or NO.  By default, 
          the server SHOULD assume no receipt is needed if the 
          attribute is not provided in the header.  Recipient messages 
          are published to the login accountÆs system topic/queue. 
        
REPLY = ôReplyö ô:ö boolean 
          REPLY is an OPTIONAL, Boolean attribute that informs the 
          subscriber that the publisher is expecting some kind of reply 
          message upon successful receipt of the published message.  If 
          the REPLY is set to YES, the subscriber SHOULD reply to the 
          message appropriately.  If the attribute is missing from the 
          header, the subscriber MUST assume that no reply is needed.  
          Reply messages are published to the login accountÆs system 
          topic/queue.

TIMEOUT = ôTimeoutö ô:ö timeout 
          TIMEOUT is the OPTIONAL period of time a message will persist 
          on the server after the current subscribers have been sent 
          the published message.  If the attribute is missing from the 
          header, the server will default to the timeout period defined 
          by the topicÆs queue.  Timeout of a negative value (<0) 
          indicates a state message and the message will persist for an 
          infinite period of time until the message is REMOVED. 
        
DEPTH = ôDepthö ô:ö number 
          DEPTH is an OPTIONAL, numeric value that determines how deep 
          a published message will be routed to other SMQP servers.  A 
          depth of zero (0) will only route a message to local 
          subscribers of the server.  Depths greater than zero will 
          allow the message to be routed to adjoining servers to the 
          given depth, at which point, the message will no longer be 
          routed.  A depth of (-1) assumes no limit to the server 
          depth.  If the attribute is not included in the header, the 
          server MUST assume a depth of zero, or only those subscribers 
          on the local server. 
        
SEQUENCE = ( ôSequenceö | ôSeqö ) ô:ö positive-number 
          SEQUENCE is an OPTIONAL, positive number that assists the 
          subscriber in knowing the sequence of a series of messages 
          from a particular publisher.  If a publisher needs to ensure 
          that published messages are received in a particular order, 
          the publisher would increment the SEQUENCE value by one each 
          time a new message is generated.  It is the responsibility of 
          the subscriber to cache messages that MAY have been received 
          out of sequence.  The subscriber MAY also be able to use the 
          CREATED attribute to help determine message sequential 
          latency at the source of the message. 
        
MIME-VERSION = ôMIME-Versionö : major ô.ö Minor 
          MIME-VERSION is an OPTIONAL attribute that informs which 
          version of the MIME specification is being supported with the 
          current message.  The subscriber MAY use this information to 
          help it understand the CONTENT-TYPE of the data. 
        
CONTENT-TYPE = ôContent-Typeö ô:ö media-type 
          CONTENT-TYPE is a REQUIRED attribute after the header.  There 
          is a content type for each data section in the message.  The 
          content type uses the MIME specification that describes the 
          format of the data to follow.  The CONTENT-TYPE belongs to 
          the header section of the data.  It is preceded by <CRLF> 
          that separates the header from the data section. 
     
                 Simple Message Queue Protocol (SMQP)   September 2001 
    
           
          Example of this attribute is 
          Content-Type: application/x-rft 
          Content-Type: text/plain; charset=öISO-8859-4ö 
        
CONTENT-LENGTH = ôContent-Lengthö ô:ö 1*DIGIT 
          The CONTENT-LENGTH is a REQUIRED attribute after the header.  
          The content length is for each data section in the message.  
          The content type is the number of bytes in the data to 
          follow. 
        
CONTENT-ENCODING = ôContent-Encodingö ô:ö 1#content-coding 
          When present, its value indicates what additional content 
          coding have been applied to the data, and thus what decoding 
          mechanism must be applied in order to obtain the media-type 
          referenced by the Content-Type.  Content-Encoding is 
          primarily used to allow a document to be compressed without 
          losing the identity of its underlying media type. 
           
          Example of this attribute is 
          Content-Encoding: zip 
        
ENCRYPTION = ôEncryptionö ô:ö encryption-scheme 1*SP 
encryption-scheme = token 
encryption-params = token ô=ö ( token | quoted-string ) 
           
CREATED = ôCreatedö ô:ö date-time 
               CREATED is a REQUIRED attribute.  It defines the date 
               and time, to the fraction of a second, when the client, 
               in GMT, created the message.  The client receiving the 
               message SHOULD only use the creation time as an 
               indication of time, since the time the publisher sent 
               the message MAY be not an absolute value since the 
               publisher internal clock and the latency of the network 
               MAY impact this time as compared to the internal clock 
               of the receiver. 
             
SMUID = ôSmuidö ô:ö host ô/ö positive-number 
               SMUID is the REQUIRED Server Message Unique Identifier.  
               This is the UID generated by the server, when the 
               publisher first published the message.  This UID is 
               always unique for a particular server and topic. 
             
CMUID = ôCmuidö ô:ö account ô/ö guid ô/ö uid 
               CMUID is the REQUIRED Client Message Unique Identifier.  
               This is the account, GUID, and the UID generated by the 
               publisher.  This information is used to reply to the 
               given message. 
             
CONTENT-TYPE = ôContent-Typeö ô:ö media-type 
               This is the content type of the data in the message.  If 
               there were no data associated with this message, then 
               this attribute would not be present.  A CONTENT-TYPE 
               would exist for each data section in the message.  The 
               CONTENT-TYPE is the MIME type of the data to follow. 
             
CONTENT-LENGTH = ôContent-Lengthö ô:ö positive-number 
               This is the content length of the data in the message.  
               If there were not data associated with the message, then 
               this attribute would not be present.  A CONTENT-LENGTH 
               would exist for each data section in the message.  The 
               CONTENT-LENGTH is always paired with CONTENT-TYPE.  The 
               CONTENT-LENGTH is a fixed number of bytes for the data 
               to follow.
