1. Introduction 

   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) [RFC3315] can 
   assign addresses statefully. Although there are other ways to assign 
   IPv6 address [RFC4339], DHCPv6 is still useful when administrator 
   desire more control over addressing. Besides, DHCPv6 also be used to 
   distribute other information when dialog state is critical [RFC4242].  

   Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) [RFC3972] are IPv6 
   addresses for which the interface identifiers are generated by 
   computing a cryptographic one-way hash function from a public key and 
   auxiliary parameters. By using the associate public & private keys as 
   described in SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) [RFC3971], CGA can 
   protect Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) [RFC4861], i.e. it provides 
   address validation and integrity protection for NDP messages. 

   This document presents a problem statement for the possible 
   interactions between DHCPv6 and CGA. Firstly, in order to support the 
   co-existing scenarios of DHCPv6 and CGA, Some operations are 
   clarified for the interaction of DHCPv6 servers and CGA-associated 
   hosts. Then, some extended scenarios are also discussed in this 
   document, including using CGAs in DHCPv6 operations to enhance the 
   security features and using DHCPv6 to serve the CGA generation. 

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

3. Co-existing of DHCPv6 and CGA 

   As an important IPv6 technique, CGA is used efficiently on the 
   stateless address configuration of IPv6 address. The public key 
   system associated with CGA address provides message origin validation 
   and integrity protection without negotiation and transportation of 
   key materials. {more} 

   The current CGA specifications does not mandate which device 
   generates a CGA address. In many cases, a CGA address is generated by 
   the associated key pair owner, which normally is also the host that 
   will use the CGA address. 

   However, in a DHCPv6-managed network, hosts should obtain IPv6 
   addresses only from a DHCPv6 server. This difference of roles needs 
   to be carefully considered during the interaction of CGA and DHCPv6. 

   Operations, as clarified in the next paragraph, support the co-
   existing of CGA's host self-generate address mechanism and DHCPv6 
   managed address mechanism. 

   This can be solved by validation procedure, which has been defined in 
   the current DHCPv6. A node requests DHCPv6 server to grant a CGA 
   generated by the node itself, listing the CGA addresses in IA options, 
   which has been defined in [RFC3315]. According to whether the CGA 
   matches the CGA-related configuration parameters of the network, the 
   DHCPv6 server sends an acknowledgement to the node, grant the usage 
   of the CGA or indicate the node that it must generate a new CGA with 
   the CGA-related configuration parameters of the network. In the 
   meantime, the DHCPv6 server has had the opportunity to log the 
   address/host combination. 

    

4. What DHCPv6 can do for CGA 

   In the current CGA specifications, there is a lack of procedures to 
   enable proper management of CGA generation. Administrators should be 
   able to configure parameters used to generate CGA. For example, 
   DHCPv6 server should be able to assign subnet prefix or certificates 
   to CGA address owner. In some scenarios, the administrator may 
   further want to enforce some parameters, particularly, the demanded 
   security related parameters such as SEC value. 

   In the CGA generation procedure, the large computational consumption 
   is needed to generate the Modifier field. This CPU intensive 
   operation can represent time and/or battery consumption problems for

   end hosts (i.e. mobile devices) with limited computing ability and/or 
   restricted battery power. In these cases, a mechanism to delegate the 
   computation of the modifier should be provided. 

   DHCPv6 can help on these issues by providing more relevant functions. 

   New DHCPv6 options may be defined to carry management parameters from 
   DHCPv6 server to the client. A new DHCPv6 prefix assignment option 
   may be define to propagate a subnet prefix. More DHCPv6 options may 
   be defined to propagate more CGA-relevant configuration information, 
   such as SEC value, certification information, SEND proxy information, 
   etc. 

   New interaction behavior between DHCPv6 server and client with a set 
   of new DHCPv6 options may be defined to allow computation delegation. 
   A node may initiate a DHCPv6 request to the DHCPv6 server for the 
   computation of the Modifier. The server either computes the Modifier 
   value, or redirects the computation require to another server. Once 
   the server obtains the modifier, it computes the CGA and responds to 
   the node with the resulting address and the corresponding CGA 
   Parameters Data Structure. 

5. What CGA can do for DHCPv6 

   DHCPv6 is vulnerable to various attacks particularly fake attack. In 
   the basic DHCPv6 specifications, regular IPv6 addresses are used. It 
   is possible for a malicious attacker to use a fake address to spoof 
   or launch an attack. A malicious fake DHCPv6 server can provide 
   incorrect configuration to the client in order to divert the client 
   to communicate with malicious services, like DNS or NTP. It may also 
   mount a denial of service attack through mis-configuration of the 
   client that causes all network communication from the client to fail. 
   Fake DHCPv6 server may also collect some critical information from 
   the client. Attackers may be able to gain unauthorized access to some 
   resources, such as network access. 

   The usage of CGA can efficiently improve the security of DHCPv6. Thus 
   the address of a DHCP message sender, which can be a DHCP server, a 
   reply agent or a client, can be verified by a receiver. It improves 
   communication security of DHCPv6 interaction. This mechanism is 
   applicable in environments where physical security on the link is not 
   assured (such as over wireless) or where available security 
   mechanisms are not sufficient, and attacks on DHCPv6 are a concern. 
   Of course, as an assumption, the advantage of CGA can be taken only 
   when CGA addresses are used in DHCPv6 communications.

6. Security Considerations 

   This whole draft is discussing security relevant problems. CGA and 
   DHCPv6 can provide additional service or security features for each 
   other. The IPv6 protocols can take advantages of each other when they 
   coexist online. 

7. IANA Considerations 

   There are no IANA considerations in this document.
