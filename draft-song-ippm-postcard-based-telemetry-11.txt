                In-Situ OAM Marking-based Direct Export
              draft-song-ippm-postcard-based-telemetry-11

Abstract

   The document describes a packet-marking variation of the IOAM DEX
   option, referred to as IOAM Marking.  Similar to IOAM DEX, IOAM
   Marking does not carry the telemetry data in user packets but send
   the telemetry data through a dedicated packet.  Unlike IOAM DEX, IOAM
   Marking does not require an extra instruction header.  IOAM Marking
   raises some unique issues that need to be considered.  This document
   formally describes the high level scheme and cover the common
   requirements and issues when applying IOAM Marking in different
   networks.  IOAM Marking is complementary to the other on-path
   telemetry schemes such as IOAM trace and E2E options.

1.  Motivation

   To gain detailed data plane visibility to support effective network
   OAM, it is essential to be able to examine the trace of user packets
   along their forwarding paths.  Such on-path flow data reflect the
   state and status of each user packet's real-time experience and
   provide valuable information for network monitoring, measurement, and
   diagnosis.

   The telemetry data include but not limited to the detailed forwarding
   path, the timestamp/latency at each network node, and, in case of
   packet drop, the drop location, and the reason.  The emerging
   programmable data plane devices allow user-defined data collection or
   conditional data collection based on trigger events.  Such on-path
   flow data are from and about the live user traffic, which complements
   the data acquired through other passive and active OAM mechanisms
   such as IPFIX [RFC7011] and ICMP [RFC2925].

   On-path telemetry was developed to cater to the need of collecting
   on-path flow data.  There are two basic modes for on-path telemetry:
   the passport mode and the postcard mode.  In the passport mode which
   is represented by IOAM trace option [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data], each
   node on the path adds the telemetry data to the user packets (i.e.,
   stamp the passport).  The accumulated data-trace carried by user
   packets are exported at a configured end node.  In the postcard mode
   which is represented by IOAM direct export option (DEX)
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-direct-export], each node directly exports the
   telemetry data using an independent packet (i.e., send a postcard) to
   avoid carrying the data with user packets.  The postcard mode is
   complementary to the passport mode.

   IOAM DEX uses an instruction header to explicitly instruct the
   telemetry data to be collected.  This document describes another
   variation of the postcard mode on-path telemetry, IOAM Marking.
   Unlike IOAM DEX, IOAM Marking does not require a telemetry
   instruction header.  However, IOAM Marking has unique issues that
   need to be considered.  This document discusses the challenges and
   their solutions which are common to the high-level scheme of IOAM
   Marking.

2.  IOAM Marking: Marking-based IOAM Direct Export

   As the name suggests, IOAM Marking only needs a marking-bit in the
   existing headers of user packets to trigger the telemetry data
   collection and export.  The sketch of IOAM Marking is as follows.  If
   on-path data need to be collected, the user packet is marked at the
   path head node.  At each IOAM Marking-aware node, if the mark is
   detected, a postcard (i.e., the dedicated OAM packet triggered by a
   marked user packet) is generated and sent to a collector.  The
   postcard contains the data requested by the management plane.  The
   requested data are configured by the management plane.  Once the
   collector receives all the postcards for a single user packet, it can
   infer the packet's forwarding path and analyze the data set.  The
   path end node is configured to unmark the packets to its original
   format if necessary.

   The overall architecture of IOAM Marking is depicted in Figure 1.

                   Figure 1: Architecture of IOAM Marking

   The advantages of IOAM Marking are summarized as follows.

   *  1: IOAM Marking avoids augmenting user packets with new headers
      and the signaling for telemetry data collection remains in the
      data plane.

   *  2: IOAM Marking is extensible for collecting arbitrary new data to
      support possible future use cases.  The data set to be collected
      can be configured through the management plane or control plane.

   *  3: IOAM Marking can avoid interfering with the normal forwarding.
      The collected data are free to be transported independently
      through in-band or out-of-band channels.  The data collecting,
      processing, assembly, encapsulation, and transport are, therefore,
      decoupled from the forwarding of the corresponding user packets
      and can be performed in data-plane slow-path if necessary.

   *  4: For IOAM Marking, the types of data collected from each node
      can vary depending on application requirements and node
      capability.

Internet-Draft          IOAM with Packet Marking           November 2021


   *  5: IOAM Marking makes it easy to secure the collected data without
      exposing it to unnecessary entities.  For example, both the
      configuration and the telemetry data can be encrypted and/or
      authenticated before being transported, so passive eavesdropping
      and a man-in-the-middle attack can both be deterred.

   *  6: Even if a user packet under inspection is dropped at some node
      in the network, the postcards collected from the preceding nodes
      are still valid and can be used to diagnose the packet drop
      location and reason.

3.  New Challenges

   Although IOAM Marking has some unique features compared to the
   passport mode telemetry and the instruction-based IOAM DEX, it
   introduces a few new challenges.

   *  Challenge 1 (Packet Marking): A user packet needs to be marked to
      trigger the path-associated data collection.  Since IOAM Marking
      does not augment user packets with any new header fields, it needs
      to reserve or reuse bits from the existing header fields.  This
      raises a similar issue as in the Alternate Marking Scheme
      [RFC8321]

   *  Challenge 2 (Configuration): Since the packet header will not
      carry IOAM instructions anymore, the data plane devices need to be
      configured to know what data to collect.  However, in general, the
      forwarding path of a flow packet (due to ECMP or dynamic routing)
      is unknown beforehand (note that there are some notable
      exceptions, such as segment routing).  If the per-flow customized
      data collection is required, configuring the data set for each
      flow at all data plane devices might be expensive in terms of
      configuration load and data plane resources.

   *  Challenge 3 (Data Correlation): Due to the variable transport
      latency, the dedicated postcard packets for a single packet may
      arrive at the collector out of order or be dropped in networks for
      some reason.  In order to infer the packet forwarding path, the
      collector needs some information from the postcard packets to
      identify the user packet affiliation and the order of path node
      traversal.

   *  Challenge 4 (Load Overhead): Since each postcard packet has its
      header, the overall network bandwidth overhead of IOAM Marking can
      be high.  A large number of postcards could add processing
      pressure on data collecting servers.  That can be used as an
      attack vector for DoS.

4.  IOAM Marking Design Considerations

   To address the above challenges, we propose several design details of
   IOAM Marking.

4.1.  Packet Marking

   To trigger the path-associated data collection, usually, a single bit
   from some header field is sufficient.  While no such bit is
   available, other packet-marking techniques are needed.  We discuss
   several possible application scenarios.

   *  IPv4.  Alternate Marking (AM) [RFC8321] is an IP flow performance
      measurement framework that also requires a single bit for packet
      coloring.  The difference is that AM does in-network measurement
      while IOAM Marking only collects and exports data at network nodes
      (i.e., the data analysis is done at the collector rather than in
      the network nodes).  AM suggests to use some reserved bit of the
      Flag field or some unused bit of the TOS field.  Actually, AM can
      be considered a sub-case of IOAM Marking, so that the same bit can
      be used for IOAM Marking.  The management plane is responsible for
      configuring the actual operation mode.

   *  SFC NSH.  The OAM bit in the NSH header can be used to trigger the
      on-path data collection [RFC8300].  IOAM Marking does not add any
      other metadata to NSH.

   *  MPLS.  Instead of choosing a header bit, we take advantage of the
      synonymous flow label [I-D.bryant-mpls-synonymous-flow-labels]
      approach to mark the packets.  A synonymous flow label indicates
      the on-path data should be collected and forwarded through a
      postcard.

   *  SRv6: A flag bit in SRH can be reserved to trigger the on-path
      data collection [I-D.song-6man-srv6-pbt].  SRv6 OAM
      [I-D.ietf-6man-spring-srv6-oam] has adopted the O-bit in SRH flags
      as the marking bit to trigger the telemetry.

4.2.  Flow Path Discovery

   In case the path that a flow traverses is unknown in advance, all
   IOAM Marking-aware nodes should be configured to react to the marked
   packets by exporting some basic data, such as node ID and TTL before
   a data set template for that flow is configured.  This way, the
   management plane can learn the flow path dynamically.






Song, et al.               Expires 19 May 2022                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft          IOAM with Packet Marking           November 2021


   If the management plane wants to collect the on-path data for some
   flow, it configures the head node(s) with a probability or time
   interval for the flow packet marking.  When the first marked packet
   is forwarded in the network, the IOAM Marking-aware nodes will export
   the basic data set to the collector.  Hence, the flow path is
   identified.  If other data types need to be collected, the management
   plane can further configure the data set's template to the target
   nodes on the flow's path.  The IOAM Marking-aware nodes collect and
   export data accordingly if the packet is marked and a data set
   template is present.

   If the flow path is changed for any reason, the new path can be
   quickly learned by the collector.  Consequently, the management plane
   controller can be directed to configure the nodes on the new path.
   The outdated configuration can be automatically timed out or
   explicitly revoked by the management plane controller.

4.3.  Packet Identity for Export Data Correlation

   The collector needs to correlate all the postcard packets for a
   single user packet.  Once this is done, the TTL (or the timestamp, if
   the network time is synchronized) can be used to infer the flow
   forwarding path.  The key issue here is to correlate all the
   postcards for the same user packet.

   The first possible approach includes the flow ID plus the user packet
   ID in the OAM packets.  For example, the flow ID can be the 5-tuple
   IP header of the user traffic, and the user packet ID can be some
   unique information pertaining to a user packet (e.g., the sequence
   number of a TCP packet).

   If the packet marking interval is large enough, the flow ID is enough
   to identify a user packet.  As a result, it can be assumed that all
   the exported postcard packets for the same flow during a short time
   interval belong to the same user packet.

   Alternatively, if the network is synchronized, then the flow ID plus
   the timestamp at each node can also infer the postcard affiliation.
   However, some errors may occur under some circumstances.  For
   example, two consecutive user packets from the same flows are marked,
   but one exported postcard from a node is lost.  It is difficult for
   the collector to decide to which user packet the remaining postcard
   is related.  In many cases, such a rare error has no catastrophic
   consequence.  Therefore it is tolerable.

4.4.  Control the Load

   IOAM Marking should not be applied to all the packets all the time.
   It is better to be used in an interactive environment where the
   network telemetry applications dynamically decide which subset of
   traffic is under scrutiny.  The network devices can limit the packet
   marking rate through sampling and metering.  The postcard packets can
   be distributed to different servers to balance the processing load.

   It is important to understand that the total amount of data exported
   by IOAM Marking is identical to that of IOAM trace option.  The only
   extra overhead is the packet header of the postcards.  In the case of
   IOAM trace option, it carries the data from each node throughout the
   path to the end node before exporting the aggregated data.  On the
   other hand, IOAM Marking directly exports local data.  The overall
   network bandwidth impact depends on the network topology and scale,
   and in some cases IOAM Marking could be more bandwidth efficient.

5.  Implementation Recommendation

5.1.  Configuration

   The head node's ACL should be configured to filter out the target
   flows for telemetry data collection.  Optionally, a flow packet
   sampling rate or probability could be configured to monitor a subset
   of the flow packets.

   The telemetry data set that should be exported by postcards at each
   path node could be configured using the data set templates specified,
   for example, in IPFIX [RFC7011].  In future revisions, we will
   provide more details.

   The IOAM Marking-aware path nodes could be configured to respond or
   ignore the marked packets.

5.2.  Postcard Format

   The postcard should use the same data export format as that used by
   IOAM.  [I-D.spiegel-ippm-ioam-rawexport] proposes a raw format that
   can be interpreted by IPFIX.  In future revisions, we will provide
   more details.

Internet-Draft          IOAM with Packet Marking           November 2021


5.3.  Data Correlation

   Enough information should be included to help the collector to
   correlate and order the postcards for a single user packet.
   Section 4.3 provides several possible means.  The application
   scenario and network protocol are important factors to determine the
   means to use.  In future revisions, we will provide details for
   representative applications.

6.  Security Considerations

   Several security issues need to be considered.

   *  Eavesdrop and tamper: the postcards can be encrypted and
      authenticated to avoid such security threats.

   *  DoS attack: IOAM Marking can be limited to a single administrative
      domain.  The mark must be removed at the egress domain edge.  The
      node can rate-limit the extra traffic incurred by postcards.

7.  IANA Considerations

   No requirement for IANA is identified.
