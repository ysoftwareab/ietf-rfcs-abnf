                      Global connectivity in 6LoWPAN
              draft-kahng-6lowpan-global-connectivity-00.txt


Abstract

   This document specifies the translation mechanism mapping IPv6
   address with 128 bits to the Adaptation Identifier (AID) with shorter
   length. When a device in IEEE802.15.4 domain needs to communicate
   with other nodes in IPv6 domain, it should acquire source AID and
   destination AID corresponding to source IPv6 address and destination
   IPv6 address, respectively from an IPv6 translation-capable gateway.
   The device will send packets using those AIDs to the gateway, and
   then the gateway will translate them to normal IPv6 addresses.

1. Introduction

   IETF 6LoWPAN is an IPv6 based low-power wireless area network and has
   been working for IPv6 packets to be sent to and received from over
   IEEE 802.15.4 based networks for applications which require wireless
   internet connectivity at lower data rates for devices.

   However it is well known that the management of addresses for devices
   that communicate across the two dissimilar domains of IPv6 and
   IEEE802.15.4 is complicated. Routing itself is another problem
   especially between the IPv6 domain and the IEEE802.15.4 domain.
   IEEE802.15.4 standard packet size is 127 bytes, among which IEEE 64
   bit extended addresses may be used. After an association, 16 bits are
   used as a unique ID in a PAN L2, Still only 102 bytes are available
   for payload at MAC layer. Now considering the devices need to
   communicate with other nodes via IPv6 domain, 256 bits of the source
   and destination addresses seem to be cumbersome in a limited MAC
   payload fields.

   It is obvious that the IP connectivity between 6LowPANs and the
   global IPv6 networks is necessary. For this connectivity, [I-
   D.6lowpan-interoperability] proposes the mapping of 16 bits short

   address and the interoperability between 6LowPAN devices and the
   external IPV6 networks. However this document does not specify
   multiple network prefix address but does single network prefix
   address to use 16 bit short addresses. In the case of the network
   configuration for the connectivity between 6LowPANs and the external
   IPv6 networks, multiple network prefix address must be considered for
   several connections between them. So this document describes the AID
   assignment mechanism in the gateway not only to support multiple
   network prefix address but to map unique IPv6 address to AID with
   short length.

   This document is based on [Interoperability of 6LoWPAN] for the
   adaptation layer of fragmentation and reassembly, the stateless
   address auto-configuration based on EUI-64[EUI64].



2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Readers are expected to be familiar with all the terms and concepts
   that are discussed in "IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area
   Networks (6LoWPANs): Overview, Assumptions, Problem Statement, and
   Goals" [RFC4919], and "Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE
   802.15.4 Networks" [RFC4944].

3. Global Connectivity in 6LoWPAN

   This section defines the gateway architecture for the Global
   Connectivity between the global IPv6 nodes and 6LowPANs. Figure 1
   shows the example of the IPv6 connection between the gateway and the
   external IPv6 nodes.

                        Figure 1: Gateway and node



3.1. AID for outbound traffic

   Outbound traffic means the traffic from the inner node to the outer
   nodes.

   1. Each node in 6LowPAN checks if it has an AID identifying its own
      global IPv6 address.

   2. Each node can use the AID if it has. Unless, it should request the
      new AID to the gateway.

   3. Each node in 6LowPAN checks if it has an AID identifying its
      corresponding global IPv6 address.

   4. Each node can use the AID if it has. Unless, it should request to
      new AID to the gateway.

   5. Each node should request to the gateway to delete both AIDs if
      they didn't use during a certain time.



3.2. AID for inbound traffic

   Inbound traffic means the traffic from the outer node to the inner
   nodes.

   1. The Gateway checks if it has an AID identifying Source IPv6
      address of the received inbound traffic.

   2. The Gateway can use the AID if it has. Unless, it should assign
      the new AID for Source IPv6 address in the inbound traffic.

   3. The Gateway checks if it has an AID identifying Destination IPv6
      address of the received inbound traffic.

   4. The Gateway can use the AID if it has. Unless, it should assign
      the new AID for Destination IPv6 address in the inbound traffic.

   5. Each node should request to the gateway to delete both AIDs if
      they didn't use during a certain time.



3.3. AID Assignment in the Gateway

   An AID must be assigned by the Gateway according to the following
   assignment method. The length of an AID being assigned is not defined
   in this document.

   1. If the Gateway receives the AID request message for the specific
      IPv6 address, it looks up its own address mapping table for the
      specific IPv6 address.

   2. If the Gateway finds the AID matched with the specific IPv6
      address, it will return the AID. Otherwise, it will generate and
      return the new AID not to be duplicated.

3.4. AID deletion in the Gateway

   An AID must be deleted by the Gateway according to the following
   deletion method.

   1. If the Gateway receives the AID delete message for the specific
      AID, it looks up its own address mapping table for the AID.

   2. If the Gateway finds the AID, it will delete the AID. Otherwise,
      it neglects the messages.

4. Mapping Table Global Connectivity in 6LoWPAN

   Gateway has the address mapping table as shown in Figure 2. The
   length of Global IPv6 address field is 128 bits. The length of AID is
   TBD.

5. Messages for AID Assignment

     The format shown in Fig 3 was used in communications to assign AID
     between internal nodes and gateway.  We defined three kinds of
     messages related to AID assignment: AID REQUEST message, AID REPLY
     message and AID DELETE message. Each AID will represent its
     corresponding global IP address. The packets will be defined as
     follows:



        Message Types      IPv6 dispatch value

        AID REQUEST        01010001

        AID REPLY         01010010

        AID DELETE        01010011



                Figure 3: Message Types for AID Assignment



6. Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC-2234 [RFC2234].



7. Security Considerations

   TBD



8. IANA Considerations

   TBD
