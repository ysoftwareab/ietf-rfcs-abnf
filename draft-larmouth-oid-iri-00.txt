   This internet draft defines the IRI/URI scheme for International
   Object Identifiers.  The syntax and semantics of the IRI is specified
   below using the International Object Identifier tree specified in
   [ITU-T X.660].

Internet-Draft  IRI/URI Namespace for International OIDs   November 2008


1.  Introduction

   The International Object Identifier tree provides a hierarchically
   based identification scheme for objects/resources, using almost all
   Unicode/ISO 10646 characters to identify arcs in the tree.  The first
   identifier in the sequence can be the name of any standards body or
   any other organization that requests an unambiguous identification of
   that organization, with subsequent identifications in the hierarchy
   being allocated by that organization.  The OID tree has been in
   existence since about 1984 in a numerical form, but the ability to
   have arcs identified by Unicode labels to identify arcs of the
   International Object Identifier tree was only standardized in 2008.

   There are just under 100,000 allocated Object Identifiers that are
   recorded in the OID Repository at http://www.oid-info.com

   This form of URI/IRI commences with "oid:/" and is followed by a
   series of Unicode labels separated by the SOLIDUS '/' character,
   identifying a node in the hierarchical International Object
   Identifier tree.

   NOTE - The SOLIDUS '/' character is not permitted in Unicode labels.

   An IRI can contain most of the Unicode characters, and in particular
   can contain all the characters allowed in a Unicode label.  A URI is
   restricted to the ASCII character set, but [RFC3987], clause 3.1
   specifies the conversion of the characters allowed in an IRI into the
   characters allowed in a URI, enabling both an IRI and a URI to carry
   the same semantics for the identification.  This mapping is an
   integral part of the "oid" URI/IRI scheme.  This enables names based
   on the Unicode labels in the International OID tree to be used
   wherever an IRI or a URI is required.

2.2.  URI scheme name

   oid

2.3.  Status

   permanent

2.4.  URI/IRI scheme syntax

   This sub-clause uses the ABNF notation commonly used in IETF RFCs
   (see [RFC 5234]).  An IRI in the "oid" scheme is syntactically the
   ABNF construct "oidiri" defined as follows (with the semantics
   specified in 2.5), and with no white-space between lexical items:

   oidiri = "oid:/" firstarcid subsequentarcid
   firstarcid = unicodelabel
   subsequentarcid = "/" unicodelabel [susequentarcid]
   unicodelabel = iunreserved

   When used as a URI, the transformations specified in [RFC 3987],
   clause 3.1 are applied.

2.5.  URI/IRI scheme semantics

   The "firstarcid" is required to be a Unicode label assigned to one of
   the arcs from the root of the International OID tree specified in
   [ITU-T X.660] (including long arcs) that identifies a node in the
   International OID tree.

   The next "unicodelabel" in the "subsequentarcid" is required to be a
   Unicode label that identifies an arc from that node to a lower level
   node.

   This repeats until the final Unicode label identifies an arc, and
   hence a node of the International OID tree, that is the referenced
   resource.

   NOTE - The last identified node is not necessarily a leaf of the
   tree, but is the identified resource.

2.6.  Encoding considerations

   The internationalized resource identifier is specified as an abstract
   sequence of Unicode characters.  The encoding of those characters

   depends on the specification of the protocol in which they are
   carried, but will normally be UTF8.

2.7.  Applications/protocols that use this scheme

   This scheme can be used by any specification requiring an IRI or URI
   based on the international OID tree to identify an object.

2.8.  Interoperability considerations

   Matching rules are based on exact equality of the sequence of
   abstract Unicode characters forming the IRI.  There are no other
   known interoperability issues.

2.9.  Security considerations

   There are no security implications in the use of this IRI scheme.
