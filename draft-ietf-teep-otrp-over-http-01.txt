           HTTP Transport for the Open Trust Protocol (OTrP)
                   draft-ietf-teep-otrp-over-http-01

Abstract

   This document specifies the HTTP transport for the Open Trust
   Protocol (OTrP), which is used to manage code and configuration data
   in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).  An implementation of this
   document can run outside of any TEE, but interacts with an OTrP
   implementation that runs inside a TEE.

1.  Introduction

   Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), including Intel SGX, ARM
   TrustZone, Secure Elements, and others, enforce that only authorized
   code can execute within the TEE, and any memory used by such code is
   protected against tampering or disclosure outside the TEE.  The Open
   Trust Protocol (OTrP) is designed to provision authorized code and
   configuration into TEEs.

   To be secure against malware, an OTrP implementation (referred to as
   an OTrP "Agent" on the client side, and a "Trusted Application
   Manager (TAM)" on the server side) must themselves run inside a TEE.
   However, the transport for OTrP, along with typical networking
   stacks, need not run inside a TEE.  This split allows the set of
   highly trusted code to be kept as small as possible, including
   allowing code (e.g., TCP/IP) that only sees encrypted messages to be
   kept out of the TEE.

   The OTrP specification [I-D.ietf-teep-opentrustprotocol] describes
   the behavior of TEEP Agents and TAMs, but does not specify the
   details of the transport, an implementation of which is referred to
   as a "Broker".  The purpose of this document is to provide such

Internet-Draft             OTrP HTTP Transport                 July 2019


   details.  That is, the HTTP transport for OTrP is implemented in a
   Broker (typically outside a TEE) that delivers messages up to an OTrP
   implementation, and accepts messages from the OTrP implementation to
   be sent over a network.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document also uses various terms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-teep-architecture], including Trusted Execution Environment
   (TEE), Trusted Application (TA), Trusted Application Manager (TAM),
   TEEP Agent, and TEEP Broker.

3.  Use of Abstract APIs

   This document refers to various APIs between a Broker and an OTrP
   implementation in the abstract, meaning the literal syntax and
   programming language are not specified, so that various concrete APIs
   can be designed (outside of the IETF) that are compliant.

   It is common in some TEE architectures (e.g., SGX) to refer to calls
   into a Trusted Application (TA) as "ECALLs" (or enclave-calls), and
   calls out from a Trusted Application (TA) as "OCALLs" (or out-calls).

   In other TEE architectures, there may be no OCALLs, but merely data
   returned from calls into a TA.  This document attempts to be agnostic
   as to the concrete API architecture.  As such, abstract APIs used in
   this document will refer to calls into a TA as API calls, and will
   simply refer to "passing data" back out of the TA.  A concrete API
   might pass data back via an OCALL or via data returned from an API
   call.

   This document will also refer to passing "no" data back out of a TA.
   In an OCALL-based architecture, this might be implemented by not
   making any such call.  In a return-based architecture, this might be
   implemented by returning 0 bytes.

4.  Use of HTTP as a Transport

   This document uses HTTP [I-D.ietf-httpbis-semantics] as a transport.
   When not called out explicitly in this document, all implementation
   recommendations in [I-D.ietf-httpbis-bcp56bis] apply to use of HTTP
   by OTrP.

Internet-Draft             OTrP HTTP Transport                 July 2019


   Redirects MAY be automatically followed, and no additional request
   headers beyond those specified by HTTP need be modified or removed
   upon a following such a redirect.

   Content is not intended to be treated as active by browsers and so
   HTTP responses with content SHOULD have the following headers as
   explained in Section 4.12 of [I-D.ietf-httpbis-bcp56bis] (replacing
   the content type with the relevant OTrP content type per the OTrP
   specification):

       Content-Type: <content type>
       Cache-Control: no-store
       X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
       Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'
       Referrer-Policy: no-referrer

   Only the POST method is specified for TAM resources exposed over
   HTTP.  A URI of such a resource is referred to as a "TAM URI".  A TAM
   URI can be any HTTP(S) URI.  The URI to use is configured in an TEEP
   Agent via an out-of-band mechanism, as discussed in the next section.

   When HTTPS is used, TLS certificates MUST be checked according to
   [RFC2818].

5.  TEEP Broker Behavior

5.1.  Receiving a request to install a new Trusted Application

   When the TEEP Broker receives a notification (e.g., from an
   application installer) that an application has a dependency on a
   given Trusted Application (TA) being available in a given type of
   TEE, the notification will contain the following:

   -  A unique identifier of the TA

   -  Optionally, any metadata to pass to the TEEP Agent.  This might
      include a TAM URI provided in the application manifest, for
      example.

   -  Optionally, any requirements that may affect the choice of TEE, if
      multiple are available to the TEEP Broker.

   When such a notification is received, the TEEP Broker first
   identifies in an implementation-dependent way which TEE (if any) is
   most appropriate based on the constraints expressed.  If there is
   only one TEE, the choice is obvious.  Otherwise, the choice might be
   based on factors such as capabilities of available TEE(s) compared
   with TEE requirements in the notification.

Internet-Draft             OTrP HTTP Transport                 July 2019


   The TEEP Broker then informs the TEEP Agent in that TEE by invoking
   an appropriate "RequestTA" API that identifies the TA needed and any
   other associated metadata.  The TEEP Broker need not know whether the
   TEE already has such a TA installed or whether it is up to date.

   The TEEP Agent will either (a) pass no data back, (b) pass back a TAM
   URI to connect to, or (c) pass back a message buffer and TAM URI to
   send it to.  The TAM URI passed back may or may not be the same as
   the TAM URI, if any, provided by the broker, depending on the TEEP
   Agent's configuration.  If they differ, the TEEP Broker MUST use the
   TAM URI passed back.

5.1.1.  Session Creation

   If no data is passed back, the TEEP Broker simply informs its client
   (e.g., the application installer) of success.

   If the TEEP Agent passes back a TAM URI with no message buffer, the
   TEEP Broker attempts to create session state, then sends an HTTP(S)
   POST to the TAM URI with an Accept header and an empty body.  The
   HTTP request is then associated with the TEEP Broker's session state.

   If the TEEP Agent instead passes back a TAM URI with a message
   buffer, the TEEP Broker attempts to create session state and handles
   the message buffer as specified in Section 5.2.

   Session state consists of:

   -  Any context (e.g., a handle) that identifies the API session with
      the TEEP Agent.

   -  Any context that identifies an HTTP request, if one is
      outstanding.  Initially, none exists.

5.2.  Getting a message buffer back from an TEEP Agent

   When a message buffer (and TAM URI) is passed to a TEEP Broker from
   an TEEP Agent, the TEEP Broker MUST do the following, using the TEEP
   Broker's session state associated with its API call to the TEEP
   Agent.

   The TEEP Broker sends an HTTP POST request to the TAM URI with Accept
   and Content-Type headers with the OTrP media type in use, and a body
   containing the OTrP message buffer provided by the TEEP Agent.  The
   HTTP request is then associated with the TEEP Broker's session state.

5.3.  Receiving an HTTP response

   When an HTTP response is received in response to a request associated
   with a given session state, the TEEP Broker MUST do the following.

   If the HTTP response body is empty, the TEEP Broker's task is
   complete, and it can delete its session state, and its task is done.

   If instead the HTTP response body is not empty, the TEEP Broker calls
   a "ProcessOTrPMessage" API (Section 6.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-teep-opentrustprotocol]) to pass the response body to the
   TEEP Agent associated with the session.  The TEEP Agent will then
   pass no data back, or pass pack a message buffer.

   If no data is passed back, the TEEP Broker's task is complete, and it
   can delete its session state, and inform its client (e.g., the
   application installer) of success.

   If instead the TEEP Agent passes back a message buffer, the TEEP
   Broker handles the message buffer as specified in Section 5.2.

5.4.  Handling checks for policy changes

   An implementation MUST provide a way to periodically check for OTrP
   policy changes.  This can be done in any implementation-specific
   manner, such as:

   A) The TEEP Broker might call into the TEEP Agent at an interval
   previously specified by the TEEP Agent.  This approach requires that
   the TEEP Broker be capable of running a periodic timer.

   B) The TEEP Broker might be informed when an existing TA is invoked,
   and call into the TEEP Agent if more time has passed than was
   previously specified by the TEEP Agent.  This approach allows the
   device to go to sleep for a potentially long period of time.

   C) The TEEP Broker might be informed when any attestation attempt
   determines that the device is out of compliance, and call into the
   TEEP Agent to remediate.

   The TEEP Broker informs the TEEP Agent by invoking an appropriate
   "RequestPolicyCheck" API.  The TEEP Agent will either (a) pass no
   data back, (b) pass back a TAM URI to connect to, or (c) pass back a
   message buffer and TAM URI to send it to.  Processing then continues
   as specified in Section 5.1.1.

Internet-Draft             OTrP HTTP Transport                 July 2019


5.5.  Error handling

   If any local error occurs where the TEEP Broker cannot get a message
   buffer (empty or not) back from the TEEP Agent, the TEEP Broker
   deletes its session state, and informs its client (e.g., the
   application installer) of a failure.

   If any HTTP request results in an HTTP error response or a lower
   layer error (e.g., network unreachable), the TEEP Broker calls the
   TEEP Agent's "ProcessError" API, and then deletes its session state
   and informs its client of a failure.

6.  TAM Broker Behavior

6.1.  Receiving an HTTP POST request

   When an HTTP POST request is received with an empty body, the TAM
   Broker invokes the TAM's "ProcessConnect" API.  The TAM will then
   pass back a (possibly empty) message buffer.

   When an HTTP POST request is received with a non-empty body, the TAM
   Broker calls the TAM's "ProcessOTrPMessage" API to pass it the
   request body.  The TAM will then pass back a (possibly empty) message
   buffer.

6.2.  Getting an empty buffer back from the TAM

   If the TAM passes back an empty buffer, the TAM Broker sends a
   successful (2xx) response with no body.

6.3.  Getting a message buffer from the TAM

   If the TAM passes back a non-empty buffer, the TAM Broker generates a
   successful (2xx) response with a Content-Type header with the OTrP
   media type in use, and with the message buffer as the body.

6.4.  Error handling

   If any error occurs where the TAM Broker cannot get a message buffer
   (empty or not) back from the TAM, the TAM Broker generates an
   appropriate HTTP error response.

7.  Sample message flow

   The following shows a sample OTrP message flow that uses application/
   otrp+json as the Content-Type.

   1.   An application installer determines (e.g., from an app manifest)
        that the application has a dependency on TA "X", and passes this
        notification to the TEEP Broker.  The TEEP Broker picks an TEEP
        Agent (e.g., the only one available) based on this notification.

   2.   The TEEP Broker calls the TEEP Agent's "RequestTA" API, passing
        TA Needed = X.

   3.   The TEEP Agent finds that no such TA is already installed, but
        that it can be obtained from a given TAM.  The TEEP Agent passes
        the TAM URI (e.g., "https://example.com/tam") to the TEEP
        Broker.  (If the TEEP Agent already had a cached TAM certificate
        that it trusts, it could skip to step 9 instead and generate a
        GetDeviceStateResponse.)

   4.   The TEEP Broker sends an HTTP POST request to the TAM URI:



           POST /tam HTTP/1.1
           Host: example.com
           Accept: application/otrp+json
           Content-Length: 0
           User-Agent: Foo/1.0

   5.   The TAM Broker receives the HTTP POST request, and calls the
        TAM's "ProcessConnect" API.

   6.   The TAM generates an OTrP message (typically
        GetDeviceStateRequest is the first message) and passes it to the
        TAM Broker.

   7.   The TAM Broker sends an HTTP successful response with the OTrP
        message in the body:



           HTTP/1.1 200 OK
           Content-Type: application/otrp+json
           Content-Length: [length of OTrP message here]
           Server: Bar/2.2
           Cache-Control: no-store
           X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
           Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'
           Referrer-Policy: no-referrer

           [OTrP message here]

   8.   The TEEP Broker gets the HTTP response, extracts the OTrP
        message and calls the TEEP Agent's "ProcessOTrPMessage" API to
        pass it the message.

   9.   The TEEP Agent processes the OTrP message, and generates an OTrP
        response (e.g., GetDeviceStateResponse) which it passes back to
        the TEEP Broker.

   10.  The TEEP Broker gets the OTrP message buffer and sends an HTTP
        POST request to the TAM URI, with the OTrP message in the body:



          POST /tam HTTP/1.1
          Host: example.com
          Accept: application/otrp+json
          Content-Type: application/otrp+json
          Content-Length: [length of OTrP message here]
          User-Agent: Foo/1.0

          [OTrP message here]

   11.  The TAM Broker receives the HTTP POST request, and calls the
        TAM's "ProcessOTrPMessage" API.

   12.  Steps 6-11 are then repeated until the TAM passes no data back
        to the TAM Broker in step 6.

   13.  The TAM Broker sends an HTTP successful response with no body:



          HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
          Server: Bar/2.2

   14.  The TEEP Broker deletes its session state.

8.  Security Considerations

   Although OTrP is protected end-to-end inside of HTTP, there is still
   value in using HTTPS for transport, since HTTPS can provide
   additional protections as discussed in Section 6 of
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-bcp56bis].  As such, Broker implementations MUST
   support HTTPS.  The choice of HTTP vs HTTPS at runtime is up to
   policy, where an administrator configures the TAM URI to be used, but
   it is expected that real deployments will always use HTTPS TAM URIs.
