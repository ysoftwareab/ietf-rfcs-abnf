     Internet-Draft		   ISIS	MIB		 December 1998


     Abstract

     This document describes	a management information base for  the
     IS-IS  Routing protocol, as described in RFC 1142 [2], when it
     is used	to  construct  routing	tables	for  IP	 networks,  as
     described in RFC 1195 [3].

     This memo defines an experimental portion  of  the  Management
     Information   Base  (MIB)  for	use  with  network  management
     protocols in the Internet community.

     This memo is based on a	draft revision of an  IETF  MIB	 dated
     September   1992   and	titled	"Integrated  IS-IS  Management
     Information Base".  This version has been modified to  include
     MIB-II	syntax,	 to  exclude portions of the protocol that are
     not relevant to	IP, such as the	ES-IS  protocol,  and  to  add
     management support for current practice.

     1.  Overview

     This document is provided to the IETF working group on IS-IS.

     The ISIS MIB consists of the following objects

       - isisSystem

            This table contains information specific	 to  a	single
            instance	of the IS-IS protocol running on a router.

       - isisCirc

            This table contains information specific	to a broadcast
            or point-to-point interface in the system.

       - isisISAdj

            This table contains information	about  adjacencies  to
            routers	maintained  by	the protocol.  Entries in this
            table cannot be created by management action: they  are
            established through the Hello protocol.

       - isisReachAddr

            This table contains information about an	address	prefix
            manually	 configured  on	 the system or learned through
            another protocol.




     2.  Definition of IS-IS	MIB


     -- This	document defines an experimental portion of the	MIB
     -- containing objects for managing the operation of the	IS-IS
     -- protocol. The objects are mainly derived from the GDMO
     -- definitions in ISO 10589.
     --
     -- The contents	of the MIB are based on	a draft	revision of an IETF
     -- MIB dated September 1992 and	titled "Integrated IS-IS Management
     -- Information Base".
     --
     -- Portions of the orignal MIB,	such as	objects	for ES-IS exchange,

     Certain	management information defined	in  this  MIB  may  be
     considered sensitive in	some network environments.

     Therefore,  authentication  of	received  SNMP	requests   and
     controlled access to management	information should be employed
     in such	environments.
