1.  Introduction

   OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection [RFC7662] specifies a method for a
   protected resource to query an OAuth 2.0 authorization server to
   determine the state of an access token and obtain data associated
   with the access token.  This allows deployments to implement
   identifier-based access tokens in an interoperable way.

   The introspection response, as specified in OAuth 2.0 Token
   Introspection [RFC7662], is a plain JSON object.  However, there are
   use cases where the resource server requires stronger assurance that
   the authorization server issued the access token, including cases
   where the authorization server assumes liability for the token's
   content.  An example is a resource server using verified person data
   to create certificates, which in turn are used to create qualified
   electronic signatures.

   In such use cases it may be useful or even required to return a
   signed JWT as the introspection response.  This specification extends
   the token introspection endpoint with the capability to return
   responses as JWTs.

Internet-Draft                JWT Response                 February 2019


2.  Requesting a JWT Response

   A resource server requests to receive a JWT introspection response by
   including an Accept header with content type "application/jwt" in the
   introspection request.

   The following is a non-normative example request:

   POST /introspect HTTP/1.1
   Host: server.example.com
   Accept: application/jwt
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   token=2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA

3.  JWT Response

   The introspection endpoint responds with a JWT, setting the Content-
   Type header to "application/jwt".

   This JWT MUST contain the claims "iss" and "aud" in order to prevent
   misuse of the JWT as ID or access token (see Section 6.1).

   This JWT MAY furthermore contain all other claims described in
   Section 2.2. of [RFC7662] and beyond (e.g. as defined in
   [OpenID.Core]).

   The following is a non-normative example response (with line breaks
   for display purposes only):

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/jwt

Internet-Draft                JWT Response                 February 2019


   {
     "sub": "Z5O3upPC88QrAjx00dis",
     "aud": "https://protected.example.net/resource",
     "scope": "read write dolphin",
     "iss": "https://server.example.com/",
     "active": true,
     "exp": 1419356238,
     "iat": 1419350238,
     "client_id": "l238j323ds-23ij4",
     "given_name": "John",
     "family_name":"Doe",
     "birthdate":"1982-02-01"
   }

   Depending on the specific resource server policy the JWT is either
   signed, or signed and encrypted.  If the JWT is signed and encrypted
   it MUST be a Nested JWT, as defined in JWT [RFC7519].

   Note: If the resource server policy requires a signed and encrypted
   response and the authorization server receives an unauthenticated
   request containing an Accept header with content type other than
   "application/jwt", it MUST refuse to serve the request and return an
   HTTP status code 400.  This is done to prevent downgrading attacks to
   obtain token data intended for release to legitimate recipients only
   (see Section 6.2).

4.  Client Metadata

   The authorization server determines what algorithm to employ to
   secure the JWT for a particular introspection response.  This
   decision can be based on registered metadata parameters for the
   resource server, supplied via dynamic client registration with the
   resource server posing as the client, as defined by this draft.

   The parameter names follow the pattern established by OpenID Connect
   Dynamic Client Registration [OpenID.Registration] for configuring
   signing and encryption algorithms for JWT responses at the UserInfo
   endpoint.

   The following client metadata parameters are introduced by this
   specification:

   introspection_signed_response_alg  JWS [RFC7515] "alg" algorithm JWA
           [RFC7518] REQUIRED for signing introspection responses.  If
           this is specified, the response will be signed using JWS and
           the configured algorithm.  The default, if omitted, is
           "RS256".

Internet-Draft                JWT Response                 February 2019


   introspection_encrypted_response_alg  JWE [RFC7516] "alg" algorithm
           JWA [RFC7518] REQUIRED for encrypting introspection
           responses.  If both signing and encryption are requested, the
           response will be signed then encrypted, with the result being
           a Nested JWT, as defined in JWT [RFC7519].  The default, if
           omitted, is that no encryption is performed.

   introspection_encrypted_response_enc  JWE [RFC7516] "enc" algorithm
           JWA [RFC7518] REQUIRED for encrypting introspection
           responses.  If "introspection_encrypted_response_alg" is
           specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256.  When
           "introspection_encrypted_response_enc" is included,
           "introspection_encrypted_response_alg" MUST also be provided.

   Resource servers may register their public encryption keys using the
   "jwks_uri" or "jwks" metadata parameters.

5.  Authorization Server Metadata

   Authorization servers SHOULD publish the supported algorithms for
   signing and encrypting the JWT of an introspection response by
   utilizing OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata [RFC8414]
   parameters.

   The following parameters are introduced by this specification:

   introspection_signing_alg_values_supported  OPTIONAL.  JSON array
           containing a list of the JWS [RFC7515] signing algorithms
           ("alg" values) JWA [RFC7518] supported by the introspection
           endpoint to sign the response.

   introspection_encryption_alg_values_supported  OPTIONAL.  JSON array
           containing a list of the JWE [RFC7516] encryption algorithms
           ("alg" values) JWA [RFC7518] supported by the introspection
           endpoint to encrypt the response.

   introspection_encryption_enc_values_supported  OPTIONAL.  JSON array
           containing a list of the JWE [RFC7516] encryption algorithms
           ("enc" values) JWA [RFC7518] supported by the introspection
           endpoint to encrypt the response.

6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  Cross-JWT Confusion

   JWT introspection responses and OpenID Connect ID Tokens are
   syntactically similar.  An attacker could therefore attempt to




Lodderstedt & Dzhuvinov  Expires August 23, 2019                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                JWT Response                 February 2019


   impersonate an end-user at a OpenID Connect relying party by passing
   the JWT as an ID token.

   Such an attack can be prevented like any other token substitution
   attack.  The authorization server MUST include the claims "iss" and
   "aud" in each JWT introspection response, with the "iss" value set to
   the authorization server's issuer URL and the "aud" value set to the
   resource server's identifier.  This allows a correctly implemented
   OpenID Connect relying party to detect substitution by checking the
   "iss" and "aud" claims as described in Section 3.1.3.7. of
   [OpenID.Core].  Relying parties SHOULD also use and check the "nonce"
   parameter and claim to prevent token and code replay.

   Resource servers utilizing JWTs to represent structured access tokens
   could be susceptible to replay attacks.  Resource servers should
   therefore apply proper counter measures against replay as described
   in [I-D.ietf-oauth-security-topics], section 2.2.

   JWT Confusion and other attacks involving JWTs are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-jwt-bcp].

6.2.  Token Data Leakage

   If the authorization server supports unauthenticated requests an
   attacker could potentially retrieve token data which must be kept
   confidential.  This attack can be prevented by either authenticating
   any request to the token introspection endpoint or by setting up the
   respective recipient for encrypted responses.

   In the latter case, confidentiality is ensured by the fact that only
   the legitimate recipient is able to decrypt the response.  An
   attacker could try to circumvent this measure by requesting a plain
   JSON response, using an Accept header with the content type set to,
   for example, "application/json" instead of "application/jwt".  To
   prevent this attack the authorization server MUST NOT serve requests
   with content type other than "application/jwt" if the resource server
   is set up to receive encrypted responses (see also Section 3).
