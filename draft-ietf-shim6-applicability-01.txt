Internet-Draft        SHIM6 Applicability Statement            June 2006


1.  Introduction

   Site multi-homing is an arrangement by which a site may use multiple
   paths to the rest of the Internet, to provide better reliability for
   traffic passing in and out of the site than would be possible with a
   single path.  Some of the motivations for operators to multi-home
   their network are described in [RFC3582].

   In IPv4, site multi-homing is achieved by introducing the additional
   state required to allow session resilience over re-homing events to
   the global Internet routing system (sometimes referred to as the
   Default-Free Zone, or DFZ) [RFC4116].  There is concern that this
   approach will not scale [RFC3221].

   In IPv6, site multi-homing in the style of IPv4 is not generally
   available to end sites due to a strict policy of route aggregation in
   the DFZ.  Site multi-homing for sites without PI addresses is
   achieved by assigning multiple addresses to each host, one or more
   from each provider.  This multi-homing approach provides no
   transport-layer stability across re-homing events.

   Shim6 introduces transport-layer mobility across re-homing events
   using a layer-3 shim approach.  State information relating to the
   multi-homing of two endpoints exchanging unicast traffic is retained
   on the endpoints themselves, rather than in the network.
   Communications between Shim6-capable hosts and Shim6-incapable hosts
   proceed as normal, but without the benefit of transport-layer
   stability.  The Shim6 approach is thought to have better scaling
   properties with respect to the state held in the DFZ than the IPv4
   approach.

   This note describes the applicability of the Level 3 multihoming
   (hereafter Shim6) protocol defined in [I-D.ietf-shim6-proto] and the
   failure detection mechanisms defined in [I-D.ietf-shim6-failure-
   detection].

2.  Application scenarios

   The goal of the Shim6 protocol is to support locator agility in
   established communications: different layer-3 endpoint addresses may
   be used to exchange packets as part of the same transport-layer
   session, all the time presenting a consistent identifier pair to
   upper-layer protocols.

   In order to be useful, the Shim6 protocol requires that at least one
   of the peers has more than one address (locator).  In the event of
   communications failure between an active pair of addresses, the Shim6
   protocol will attempt to reestablish communication by trying
   different combinations of locators.

   While the Shim6 protocol does not impose any requirements on the
   disposition of the locators involved in this process, the scenario in
   which the Shim6 protocol is expected to operate is that of a multi-
   homed site which is connected to multiple transit providers, and
   which receives an IPv6 prefix from each of them.  This configuration
   is intended to provide protection for the end-site in the event of a
   failure in some subset of the available transit providers without
   requiring the end-site to acquire provider-independent (PI) address
   space.

     `--------------------------------------'

   Figure 1

   In the scenario illustrated in Figure 1 host H communicates with some
   remote host H'.  Each of the addresses L[i] configured on host H in
   the multi-homed site S can be reached through provider ISP[i] only,
   since ISP[i] is solely responsible for originating a covering prefix
   for P[i] to the rest of the Internet.

   The use of locator L[i] on H hence causes inbound traffic towards H
   to be routed through ISP[i].  Changing the locator used from L[i] to
   L[j] will have the effect of re-routing inbound traffic to H from
   ISP[i] to ISP[j].  This is the central mechanism by which the Shim6
   protocol aims to provide multi-homing functionality: by changing
   locators, the H can change the upstream ISP used to route inbound
   packets towards itself.  Corresponding control of the outbound path
   for packets from H towards H' is shared between the locator L'[j]
   chosen by H', and the administrative exit selection policy of site S.

   The Shim6 protocol has other potential applications beyond site
   multi-homing.  For example, since Shim6 is a host-based protocol, it
   can also be used to support session mobility between interfaces on a
   multi-homed host.  A failure in communication between a multi-homed
   host and some other, remote host might be repaired by selection of a
   locator associated with a different interface.

3.  Address Configuration

3.1.  Protocol Version (IPv4 vs. IPv6)

   The Shim6 protocol is defined only for IPv6.  However, there is no
   fundamental reason why a Shim6-like approach could not support IPv4
   addresses as locators, either to provide multi-homing support to
   IPv4-numbered sites, or as part of an IPv4/IPv6 transition strategy.
   Some extensions to the shim6 protocol for supporting IPv4 locators
   have been proposed in [I-D.nordmark-shim6-esd].

   The Shim6 protocol, as specified for IPv6, incorporates cryptographic
   elements in the construction of locators (see [RFC3972], [I-D.ietf-
   shim6-hba]).  Since IPv4 addresses are insufficiently large to
   contain addresses constructed in this fashion, direct implementation
   of Shim6 as specified for IPv6 for use with IPv4 addresses might
   require protocol modifications.

3.2.  Prefix Lengths

   The Shim6 protocol does not assume that all the addresses assigned to
   the multihomed site have the same prefix length.

   The use of CGA [RFC3972] and HBA [I-D.ietf-shim6-hba] involve
   encoding information in the lower 64 bits of locators.  This imposes
   the requirement on address assignment to Shim6-capable hosts that all
   interface addresses should be able to accommodate 64-bit interface
   identifiers.  This requirement is also imposed by CGA [RFC3972].

3.3.  Address Generation

   The security of the Shim6 protocol is based on the use of CGA and HBA
   addresses.

   CGA and HBA can be generated through the stateless auto-configuration
   mechanism defined in [RFC2462] with the additional considerations
   presented in [RFC3972] and [I-D.ietf-shim6-hba].

   Stateful address auto-configuration using DHCP [RFC3315] is not
   currently supported, because there is no defined mechanism to convey
   the CGA Parameter Data Structure and other relevant information from
   the DHCP server to the host.  The definition of such mechanisms seems
   to be quite straightforward in the case of the HBA, since only the
   CGA Parameter Data Structure needs to be delivered from the DHCP
   server to the Shim6 host, and that data structure does not contain
   any secret information.  In the case of CGAs, however, private key
   information must be exchanged as well as the CGA Parameter Data
   Structure.

Internet-Draft        SHIM6 Applicability Statement            June 2006


3.4.  Use of CGA vs. HBA

   The choice between CGA and HBA is a trade-off between flexibility and
   performance.

   The use of HBA is more efficient in the sense that addresses require
   less computation than CBA, involving only hash operations for both
   the generation and the verification of locator sets.  However, with
   HBA the locator set is determined during the generation process, and
   cannot be subsequently changed; addition of new locators to that
   initial set is not supported, except by re-generation of the entire
   set which will cause all addresses to change.

   Use of CGA is more computationally expensive, involving public key
   cryptography in the verification of locator sets.  However, CGAs are
   more flexible in the sense that they support the dynamic modification
   of locator sets.

   CGAs are well suited to support dynamic environments such as mobile
   hosts, where the locator set must be changed frequently.  HBAs are
   better suited for static sites where the prefix set remains
   relatively stable.

   It should be noted that, since HBAs are defined as a CGA extension,
   it is possible to generate hybrid HBA/CGA structures that incorporate
   the strengths of both: i.e. that a single address can be used as an
   HBA, enabling computationally-cheap validation amongst a fixed set of
   addresses, and also as a CGA, enabling dynamic manipulation of the
   locator set.  For additional details, see [I-D.ietf-shim6-hba].

4.  Shim6 Capabilities

4.1.  Fault Tolerance

4.1.1.  Establishing Communications After an Outage

   If a host within a multihomed site attempts to establish
   communication with a remote host outside the site while one of the
   site's transit paths has failed, and selects an local locator from
   which to source packets which corresponds to the failed transit path,
   bidirectional communication between the two hosts will not succeed.
   The failure of the transit path will not, in general, be known in
   advance to the host.

   In order to establish communication, the initiating host must try
   different combinations of (source, destination) locator until it
   finds a pair that works.  The mechanism for this default address
   selection is described in [RFC3484]; commentary on this mechanism in
   the context of multi-homed environments can be found in [I-D.bagnulo-
   ipv6-rfc3484-update].

   Since Shim6 context is normally only established between two hosts
   after initial communication has been established, there is no
   opportunity for shim6 to participate in the discovery of a suitable,
   initial (source, destination) locator pair.

4.1.2.  Short-Lived Communications

   The Shim6 context establishment operation requires a 4-way packet
   exchange, and involves some overhead on the participating hosts in
   memory and CPU.

   For short-lived exchanges between two hosts, the benefit of
   establishing a Shim6 context might not exceed the cost, perhaps
   because the protocols concerned are tolerant of failure and can
   arrange their own recovery (e.g.  DNS) or because the frequency of
   re-homing events is sufficiently low that the probability of such a
   failure occuring during a short-lived exchange is not considered
   significant.

   It is anticipated that the exchange of Shim6 context will provide
   most benefit for exchanges between hosts which are long-lived.  For
   this reason the default behaviour of Shim6-capable hosts is expected
   to employ deferred context setup.  This default behaviour will be
   able to be overridden by applications which prefer immediate context
   establishment regardless of transaction longeivity.

   It must be noted that all the above considerations refer to lifetime



Abley & Bagnulo         Expires December 7, 2006                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft        SHIM6 Applicability Statement            June 2006


   of the contact between the peers and not about the lifetime of the
   particular connection (e.g.  TCP connection).  In other words, the
   shim6 context is established between ULID pairs and it affects all
   the communication between these ULIDs.  So, two nodes that perform
   multiple short lived communications with the same ULID pair would
   benefit as much from the shim features as two nodes having a single
   long-lived communication.

4.1.3.  Long-Lived Communications

   As discussed in Section 4.1.2, hosts engaged in long-lived
   communications will suffer lower proportional overhead, and greater
   probability of benefit than those performing brief transactions.

   Deferred context setup ensures that session establishment time will
   not be increased by the use of Shim6.

4.2.  Load Balancing

   The Shim6 protocol does not support load balancing within a single
   context: all packets associated with a particular context are
   exchanged using a single locator pair per direction, with the
   exception of forked contexts which involve the upper-layer protocol.

   It may be possible to extend the shim6 protocol to use multiple
   locator pairs in a single context, but the impact of such an
   extension on upper-layer protocols (e.g. on TCP congestion control)
   should be considered carefully.

   When many contexts are considered together in aggregate, e.g. on a
   single host which participates in many simultaneous contexts or in a
   site full of hosts, some degree of load sharing should occur
   naturally due to the selection of different locator pairs in each
   context.  There is no mechanism defined to ensure that this natral
   load sharing is arranged to provide a statistical balance between
   transit providers, however.

4.3.  Traffic Engineering

   The Shim6 protocol provides some lightweight traffic engineering
   capabilities in the form of the Locator Preferences option, which
   allows a host to inform a remote host of local preferences for
   locator selection.

   This mechanism is only available after a Shim6 context has been
   established, and is a host-based capability rather than a site-based
   capability.  There is no defined mechanism which would allow use of
   the Locator Preferences option amongst a site full of hosts to be

5.  Interaction with Other Protocols

5.1.  Shim6 and Mobile IPv6

   Three scenarios where the Shim6 protocol and the MIPv6 protocol MIPv6
   protocol [RFC3775] might be used simultaneously have been considered.

5.1.1.  Multi-homed Home Network

   In this case, the Home Network of the Mobile Node (MN) is multi-
   homed.  This implies the availability of multiple Home Network
   prefixes, resulting on multiple HoAs for each MN.  Since the MN is a
   node within a multihomed site, it seems reasonable to expect that the
   MN should able to benefit from the multihoming capabilities provided
   by the Shim6 protocol.  Moreover, the MN needs to be able to obtain
   the multihoming benefits even when it is roaming away from the Home
   Network: if the MN is away from the Home Network while the Home
   Network suffers a failure in a transit path, the MN should be able to
   continue communicating using alternate paths to reach the Home
   Network.

   The resulting scenario is the following:


          +------------------------------------+
          |               Internet             |
          +------------------------------------+
             |                   |
           +----+              +----+
           |ISP1|              |ISP2|
           +----+              +----+
             |                   |
          +------------------------------------+
          |   Multihomed Home Network          |
          |   Prefixes: P1 and P2              |
          |                                    |
          |                   Home Agent       |
          |                   //               |
          +------------------//----------------+
                            //
                           //
                         +-----+
                         | MN  | HoA1, HoA2
                         +-----+

   Figure 2

   So, in this configuration, the shim6 protocol is used to provide

   multihoming supports to all the nodes within the multihomed sites
   (including the mobile nodes) and the MIPv6 protocol is used to
   support mobility of the mobile nodes of the multihomed site.

   The proposed protocol architecture would be the following:


       +--------------+
       |  Application |
       +--------------+
       |  Transport   |
       +--------------+
       |      IP      |
       | +----------+ |
       | |  IPSec   | |
       | +----------+<--ULIDs
       | | shim6    | |
       | +----------+<--HoAs
       | | MIPv6    | |
       | +----------+<--CoAs
       |              |
       +--------------+


   Figure 3

   In this architecture, the upper layer protocols and IPSec would use
   ULIDs of the shim6 protocol.  Only the HoAs will be presented to the
   shim6 layer as potential ULIDs.  The shim6 protocol will then be used
   to provide failover between different HoAs.  This is useful to
   preserve established communications when an outage affects the path
   through the ISP that has delegated the HoA used for initiating the
   communication (similarly to the case of a host within a multihomed
   site).  The CoAs are not presented to the shim6 layer and are not
   included in the local locator set in this case.  The CoAs are managed
   by the MIPv6 layer, that binds each HoA to a CoA.

   So, in this case, the ULP select a ULID pair for the communication.
   The shim6 protocol translates the ULID pair to an alternative locator
   is case that is needed.  Both the ULIDs and the alternative locators
   are HoAs.  Next, the MIPv6 layer maps the selected HoA to the
   corresponding CoA, and this is the actual address included in the
   wire.

   The shim6 context is established between the MN and the CN, and it
   would allow the communication to use all the available HoAs to
   provide fault tolerance.  The MIPv6 protocol is used between the MN
   and the HA in the case of the bidirectional tunnel mode and between

   the MN and the CN in case of the RO mode.

5.1.2.  Shim6 between the HA and the MN

   Another scenario where a shim6-MIPv6 interaction may be useful is the
   case where a shim6 context is established between the MN and the Home
   Agent (HA) in order to provide fault tolerance capabilities to the
   bidirectional tunnel between them.

   Consider the case where the HA has multiple addresses (whether
   because the Home Network is multihomed or because the HA has multiple
   interfaces) and/or the MN has multiple addresses (whether because the
   visited network is multihomed or because the MN has multiple
   interfaces).  In this case, if a failure affects the address pair
   that is being used to run the tunnel between the MN and HA,
   additional mechanisms need to be used to preserve the communication.

   One possibility would be to use MIPv6 capabilities, by simply
   changing the CoA used as the tunnel endpoint.  However, MIPv6 lacks
   of failure detection mechanisms that would allow the MN and/or the HA
   to detect the failure and trigger the usage of an alternative
   address.  Shim6 provides such failure detection protocol, so one
   possibility would be re-use the failure detection function from the
   shim6 failure detection protocol in MIPv6.  In this case, the shim6
   protocol wouldn&#65533;t be used to create shim6 context and provide
   fault tolerance, but just the failure detection functionality would
   be re-used.

   The other possibility would be to use the shim6 protocol to create a
   shim6 context between the HA and the MN so that the shim6 detects any
   failure and re-homes the communication in a transparent fashion to
   MIPv6.  In this case, the shim6 protocol would be associated to the
   tunnel interface

5.1.3.  Shim6-based Route Optimization

   Another scenario where it may be reasonable to support the
   simultaneous operation of MIPv6 and the shim6 protocol is to achieve
   some form of shim6-based Route Optimization.  This case is similar to
   the one described in the multihomed home network section, the
   difference being that both the HoAs and the CoAs available in the MN
   are presented to the shim6 layer.  The result is that the shim6 layer
   can select a CoA as an alternative address for an ongoing
   communication resulting in a route optimization mechanism.  In this
   case, the shim6 protocol is used to provide both fault tolerance and
   route optimization, while the MIPv6 protocol is used for initial
   contact and non-optimized communications.

5.2.  Shim6 and SeND

   Secure Neighbour Discovery (SeND) [RFC3971] uses CGAs to prove
   address ownership for Neighbour Discovery [RFC2461].  The Shim6
   protocol can use either CGAs or HBAs to protect locator sets included
   in Shim6 contexts.  It is expected that some hosts will need to
   participate in both SeND and Shim6 simultaneously.

   In the case that both the SeND and Shim6 protocols are using the CGA
   technique to generate addresses, then there is no conflict: the host
   will generate addresses for both purposes as CGAs, and since it will
   be in control of the associated private key, the same CGA can be used
   for the different protocols.

   In the case that a Shim6-capable host is using HBAs to protect its
   locator sets, the host will need to generate hybrid HBA/CGA addresses
   as defined in [I-D.ietf-shim6-hba] and discussed briefly in
   Section 3.4.  In this case, the CGA Parameter Data Structure
   containing a valid public key and the Multi-Prefix extension is
   included as inputs to the hash function.

5.3.  Shim6 and SCTP

   The SCTP [RFC2960] protocol provides a reliable, stream-based
   communications channel between two hosts which provides a superset of
   the capabilities of TCP.  One of the notable features of SCTP is that
   it allows the exchange of endpoint addresses between hosts, and is
   able to recover from the failure of a particular endpoint pair in a
   manner which is conceptually similar to locator selection in Shim6.

   SCTP is a transport-layer protocol, higher in the protocol stack than
   Shim6, and hence there is no fundamental incompatibility which would
   prevent a Shim6-capable host from communicating using SCTP.

   However, since SCTP and Shim6 both aim to exchange addressing
   information between hosts in order to meet the same general goal, it
   is possible that their simultaneous use might result in unexpected
   behaviour, e.g. due to race conditions.

   The capabilities of SCTP with respect to path maintenance of a
   reliable, connection-oriented stream protocol are more extensive than
   the more general layer-3 locator agility provided by Shim6.  It is
   recommended that Shim6 is not used for SCTP sessions, and that path
   maintenance is provided solely by SCTP.

5.4.  Shim6 and NEMO

   The NEMO [RFC3963] protocol extensions to MIPv6 allow a Mobile

   Network to communicate through a bidirectional tunnel via a Mobile
   Router (MR) to a NEMO-compliant Home Agent (HA) located in a Home
   Network.

   If either or both of the MR or HA are multi-homed, then a Shim6
   context established between them preserves the integrity of the
   bidirectional tunnel between them in the event that a transit failure
   occurs between them.  The MR in this case can be considered to be
   immobile either side of the failure event, and the Shim6 protocol
   provides a stable pair of ULIDs for the tunnel endopints.

   Once the tunnel between MR and HA is established, hosts within the
   Mobile Network which are Shim6-capable can establish contexts with
   remote hosts in order to receive the same multi-homing benefits as
   any host located within the Home Network.
