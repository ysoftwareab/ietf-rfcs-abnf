Abstract

   This document augments the notification mechanism defined in the
   Conference Event Package [2] to suit the specific needs of the
   Centralized Conferencing Framework [1] and the Data Model for
   Centralized Conferencing [3].  The document registers a new media
   subtype for this purpose.  Support for this new data format may be
   negotiated using Accept header semantics as defined in the Session

Internet-Draft          xcon-eventpkg-extensions               July 2007


1.  Introduction

   The conferencing framework [1] describes a framework for centralized
   conferencing.  It specifies the need for a notification mechanism to
   deliver conference state updates to conference-aware clients.  The
   purpose of this document is to fill that requirement for the data
   model defined for centralized conferencing and build upon the
   framework established in the conference event package [2].


2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1] and indicate requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.


3.  Partial notification limitations

   The media type 'application/conference-info+xml' is defined in the
   conference event package [2].  Section 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6 of [2]
   specify a mechanism to send partial updates of conference state
   information.  The algorithm defined in those sections, however,
   prevents the partial notifications for non-atomic sub-elements of
   elements like 'available-media' (defined in Section 5.3.4 of [2]) and
   'media' (defined in Section 5.7.8 of [2]) as these elements do not
   contain a state attribute defined.

   The data model for centralized conferencing [3] introduces the
   concept of controls for controling media.  This is defined under
   'available-media' for streams from the mixer and under 'media' for
   streams received from and sent to the mixer from conference
   participant's endpoints.  A 'floor' element has also been defined
   under the 'media' element.  These elements may frequently change
   their state over the course of a conference.  The list of media could
   grow significantly large for large conferences.  Furthermore, clients
   receiving updates of media often need to know which specific control
   changed when a notification as such is received.

   To overcome these limitations, a partial notification mechanism needs
   to be defined for these elements.  Thus, state attributes and element
   keys (for the sub-elements) have been defined in the data model [3]
   for these elements.  This, however, requires that a new media subtype
   be defined and registered as these elements have been explicitly
   marked as not having a state attribute in [2].  A conferencing
   system, implementing only [2], may not expect to receive these XML

   elements with a state attribute of partial and thus this may result
   in inconsistent conferencing state.  In-order to overcome this
   limitation this specification defines a new media subtype which can
   be used to enable partial notifications of elements previously
   defined without a state attribute.


4.  Goals for this document

   Listed here are some of the goals for this document.

   (1) It should satisfy all the notifications needs defined in the
   conferencing framework [1] and the data model defined for centralized
   conferencing in [3].

   (2) It should support partial updates of changes in elements defined
   in the data model for centralized conferencing [3] such as controls
   and list elements.  Clients receiving partial notifications can
   determine the specific control that changed by examining the
   notification received. [[ During IETF-67, it was determined that
   there would be changes required in this area. ]]

   (3) The document should describe how conference-aware clients
   implementing the conference event package [2] (and the data format
   defined therein) will work against the centralized conferencing
   defined data format. [[ Note that this is a MAY.  However, as per
   Section 3.4 in [2] states, all subscribers and notifiers MUST support
   the "application/conference-info+xml" data format.]]


5.  Elements supporting  partial updates

   As specified earlier, the following list captures elements defined in
   [2] not supporting partial updates:

   1.  Conference information 'available-media' XML element defined in
   Section 5.3.4 of [2]

   2.  Endpoint 'media' XML element defined in Section 5.7.8 of [2]

5.1.  Available-media

   With the introduction of the state attribute to available-media in
   [3], element keys are defined as follows for sub-elements.

   The sub-element 'entry' is defined with the attribute key 'label'.

   The non-atomic sub-elements under 'entry' are 'codecs' and



Srinivasan & Even       Expires January 10, 2008                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft          xcon-eventpkg-extensions               July 2007


   'controls'.

   There are no requirements to have 'codecs' support partial updates as
   these are expected to change rarely.

   The 'controls' element is defined with a state attribute as well.
   The sub-elements appearing under 'controls' do not require a key as
   each sub-element (like 'mute' or 'gain') appears only once and is
   atomic.  That is, in a partial notification, the 'mute' element (and
   all sub-elements) should be included.

5.2.  Media

   Similarly, the introduction of the state attribute to media requires
   element keys to be defined for its sub-elements.

   The 'endpoints' element (under which 'media' appears) has the state
   attribute defined and so do all its parent elements.

   The non-atomic sub-elements under 'media' are 'from-mixer' and 'to-
   mixer'.  Both of which have the state attribute defined.  The non-
   atomic sub-element appearing under both 'from-mixer' and 'to-mixer'
   is the 'controls' element.

   The 'floor' element is an atomic sub-element of 'from-mixer' or 'to-
   mixer' and thus does not require a state attribute.

   The 'controls' element is a non-atomic sub-element and thus has a
   'state' attribute defined.  The sub-elements appearing under
   'controls', as defined in the previous section, do not require a key
   as each sub-element appears only once and is atomic.


6.  New media type definition

   This document defines a new media type 'application/
   xcon-conference-info+xml' for supporting the data model for
   centralized confeerncing for which the XML schema (data format) is
   defined in [3].  Implementations MUST follow all sections of [2] not
   related directly to the data model.  These include, but are not
   limited to, Section 3, Section 4 (see annotations below), Section 8
   and Section 9.1.


7.  Client Considerations

   Conference-aware clients, implementing the conference event package
   [2], SHOULD be able to subscribe to conference state information from

Internet-Draft          xcon-eventpkg-extensions               July 2007


   the conferencing focus.  The conference focus thus SHOULD support
   media types defined here as well as the one defined in the conference
   event package for backward compatibility.  If there is lack of
   support for the media type format defined in conference event
   package, then clients not supporting it will not be able to interwork
   with the centralized conferencing clients implementing [3].


8.  Security Considerations

   TBD
