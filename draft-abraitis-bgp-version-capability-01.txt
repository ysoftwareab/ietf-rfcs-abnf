1.  Introduction

   In modern data center designs, we tend to have conventional hosts
   participating in the routing process.  And the fleet of hosts has
   different versions of routing daemon.  This means that
   troubleshooting is a crucial part to quickly identify the root cause.
   This document introduces new BGP capability to advertise the version
   of routing daemon.

2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Version Capability

   The Version Capability is a new BGP capability [RFC5492].

                   +--------------------------------+
                   |    Version Length (1 octet)    |
                   +--------------------------------+
                   |      Version (variable)        |
                   +--------------------------------+

                                 Figure 1

   Version Length:

      The number of characters in the Version

   Version:

      The Version encoded via UTF-8

4.  Operation

   The Version capability SHOULD only be used for displaying the version
   of a speaker in order to make troubleshooting easier.  You have a
   bunch of routers with a number of upstreams each.  All of them are
   with a different operating system and routing daemon installed.
   Assuming that a specific feature is not working or a bug which is not
   fixed in an appropriate version, would allow us to quickly identify
   the pattern which versions are affected.  Below is an example of
   implementation in [FRRouting] how it looks like with version
   advertised by a BGP sender:

   :~# vtysh -c 'show ip bgp neighbors 192.168.0.1 json' \
   > | jq '."192.168.0.1".neighborCapabilities.versions'
   {
     "advertisedVersion": "FRRouting 7.2-dev-MyOwnFRRVersion",
     "receivedVersion": "FRRouting 7.2-dev-MyOwnFRRVersion-gc68bb14"
   }

                                 Figure 2

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a capability number for the Version
   Capability in this document from the BGP Capabilities Codes registry.

6.  Security Considerations

   All drafts are required to have a security considerations section.
   See RFC 3552 [RFC3552] for a guide.
