    Extension of ANCP for Satellite and Terrestrial Modem Networks June 2007 
        

    Abstract 

       The Access Node Control Protocol (ANCP) has been developed primarily 
       for the Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) environment, with varying line 
       conditions where the system that uses ANCP consists of DSLAMs (DSL 
       access multiplexers) and terminal equipment.  In this scenario, the 
       channel conditions on subscriber lines vary, forcing changes and 
       adaptations in line rates at the modem equipment, and affecting 
       services offered.  Satellite communications service providers have 
       very similar issues and are also based around hubs, with satellite 
       terminals.  This application of ANCP could also be extended to point-
       to-point radio services in both the satellite and terrestrial domain.

    1. Introduction 

    Routers used at the network edge in remote locations often have to be 
    connected to custom smart adaptive wireless external modems for backhaul 
    to the terrestrial Internet. 

    These external modems are separate to the router, and are connected to 
    the router via a normal interface, commonly Ethernet.  Due to the large 
    choice of purpose-specific modems available, router manufacturers cannot 
    integrate all these variants into their routers as standard interfaces.

    Ethernet is becoming the most popular interface used to connect routers 
    with custom modems, simply because Ethernet is ubiquitous and cheap. 

    Many modems are smart in that the modem varies its wireless link speed 
    to another modem or hub according to current wireless channel 
    conditions, to get the most out of the channel at all times.  Similarly, 
    the modem at the other end of the link varies its output speed, too, to 
    adapt to current channel conditions.  Smart adaptive wireless modems are 
    increasingly common. 

    There are a number of different topologies for satellite networks, 
    namely point-to-point, mesh, and hub-and-spoke deployments.  Just as DSL 
    modems retrain automatically due to varying channel conditions on the 
    line, satellite modems can do the same either manually or automatically 
    as wireless channel conditions vary.  Satellite operators can adjust the 
    amount of Forward Error Coding (FEC) used over the air interface to 
    provide a particular bit error rate.  This affects the overall link 
    capacity offered to the user.  The effects of changes in the access line 
    rate are identical between satellite and DSL, and traffic shaping is 
    required to allow the router/modem combination to handle the modem's 
    current link conditions well. 

    However, the fixed link to the router's interface is of a fixed speed 
    (say 100Mbps Ethernet), and the router does not see or know how the 
    modem's offered speed is varying.  There is an 'information gap' across 
    the fixed link between the router's output interface speed and the 
    modem's output interface speed on its wireless link.  As a result, there 
    is a gap between how the router configures traffic shaping on its fixed 
    interface and the traffic shaping that the modem needs for its current 
    output rate - a fixed QoS/traffic shaping configuration is not suitable 
    for the varying speeds out the modem's own wireless link. 

    A smart wireless non-line-of-sight modem might scale, depending on 
    channel conditions, from, say, 1Mbps to 6Mbps. A satellite modem might 
    change from 1.5Mbps to 720kbps downstream to the user modem, or from say 
    32kbps up to 512kbps upstream back to the hub. Meanwhile, that modem 
    would be connected to the router via a 100Mbps Ethernet link. 

    Rate limiting on the router's output Ethernet interface is obviously 
    needed to prevent most of the 100Mbps traffic that that link can carry 
    being discarded by the modem -- but what limit should the router choose? 
    The highest speed the modem uses? The most common speed the modem uses? 
    Rate limiting should vary as the modem's speed varies to adapt to 
    wireless channel conditions. Many applications auto-tune to the 
    available rate, but voice traffic needs to be policed to the available 
    rate and protected from other applications.  This requires the shaping 
    policies for individual classes of traffic to be adaptive as well.

    It is important to note that many of the multicast issues being 
    considered by ANCP are also equally relevant to the satellite and 
    wireless solutions.  Though the technologies applied may be entirely 
    different in their broadcast and multicast capabilities, the need for 
    interaction between this type of traffic and allocated bandwidths 
    upstream is equally important. 

    The extensions mentioned in this draft are in two sections.  Firstly, 
    modifications that are required to adapt ANCP for satellite hub-and-
    spoke deployments, where a satellite hub is equivalent to a DSLAM, and a 
    satellite terminal is equivalent to the DSL modem. 

    Secondly, we discuss options that allow the ANCP protocol to be taken 
    further and adopted by a wider range of applications, namely point-to-
    point and mesh topologies.  Satellite networks are a prime candidate for 
    this technique.  However, ANCP with modifications could also be suitable 
    for point-to-point terrestrial wireless networks. 

     

    2. Comparison of Satellite Topology to DSL framework 

       In order to map satellite terminology into the ANCP framework, we 
       have taken the standard framework from [1] and reproduced it below, 
       replacing the DSL hardware with satellite hardware. 

       Terminology: 

       o SM - Satellite Modem, which includes the RF equipment and 
          satellite dish, as well as the indoor unit (IDU) that communicates 
          with a router. 

       o SAT - Satellite, which is traditionally a bent-pipe layer 1 device 
          that passes and amplifies the channel, though new satellite 
          designs are moving to layer-2 and -3 devices over time.  We assume 
          that, though the satellite link enables connectivity, the 
          satellite is not otherwise involved in or managed in the topology 
          presented here. 

       o SAT HUB - Satellite Hub, which terminates the RF signals from the 
          satellite modems, manages traffic and the MAC layer of the 
          satellite modems and itself.

    2.1. Changes to ANCP for Satellite Networks 

       The following changes to ANCP are anticipated to deal with a wireless 
       or satellite hub. 

       o The Tech Type field type indicates the technology to which the 
          capability extension applies. For access node control in case of 
          satellite networks, a new "wireless" type is proposed. The value 
          for this field would need to be reserved.  The terminology of 
          wireless was chosen as it covers the widest range of both 
          satellite and terrestrial applications. 

       o The GSMP Event message with PORT UP message type (80) is used for 
          conveying line attributes to the NAS.  The Tech Type field needs 
          to be extended as above. 

       o The GSMP Event message with PORT DOWN message type (80) is used 
          for conveying line state to the NAS. The Tech Type field needs to 
          be extended as above.

       o  The "Extension Value" contains one or more TLVs (Type, Length and 
          Value tuples) to identify an access line and define its 
          characteristics.  A TLV can consist of multiple sub-TLVs.  A new 
          TLV type for wireless link attributes is required. Many of the 
          sub-TLVs for DSL are reusable for wireless.  The following need to 
          be modified or alternate versions created, to deal with the new 
          access medium.  

     
              . Type (DSL-Type = 0x91) : Defines the type of transmission 
                system in use. 
                 
                Value :(Transmission system : ADSL1 = 0x01, ADSL2   
                =0x02, ADSL2+ = 0x03, VDSL1 = 0x04, VDSL2 = 0x05, SDSL  
                = 0x06, UNKNOWN = 0x07).  
     
               . Type (DSL line state = 0x8F) : The state of the DSL line. 
               For PORT UP message, at this time, the TLV is optional (since 
               the message type implicitly conveys the state of the line). 
               For PORT DOWN, the TLV is mandatory, since it further 
               communicates the state of the line as IDLE or SILENT.   
     
               Value :{ SHOWTIME = 0x01, IDLE = 0x02, SILENT = 0x03 }  
     
     
    3. Alternate ANCP frameworks for other topologies  

    3.1. Description of the environment 

       The following sections describe potential applicability of ANCP to 
       the satellite and terrestrial radio markets.  These sections are 
       presented as a number of options, each expanding the use of ANCP 
       beyond its original aim of solely supporting DSL, but giving the 
       protocol much greater applicability outside the DSL market.  

    3.2. User-End ANCP for satellite hub-spoke topology  

       While the shaping of traffic from the Satellite Hub (SAT HUB) to the 
       Satellite Modem (SM) is of importance, in the satellite scenario, the 
       reverse path also varies due to varying channel conditions.  The same 
       requirements to change traffic shaping are thus also required between 
       the SM and the CPE Router (RTR).

       Note that the Regional Network on the right-hand side has not been 
       drawn due to lack of space. 

    3.2.1. Changes to ANCP for this framework 

       At this stage it is difficult to be definitive in the changes 
       required in ANCP for a User-End version of ANCP.  What can be 
       determined at this early stage are the following high-level 
       requirements on the portability of the implementations. 

       o By their very nature, the routers that would need to implement 
          ANCP at the user end would be smaller, have lower CPU capacity and 
          memory footprint than any NAS router.  This is offset by the fact 
          that in many cases they are supporting a far lower number of users 
          per ANCP instance.

       o It is unlikely in many instances that a policy server equivalent 
          to the one specified to support the NAS router will be present.  
          So the User-End ANCP may need to work with a predefined number of 
          policies configured in the router. 

    3.3. Framework for User-End ANCP in a point-to-point topology 

       The natural evolution of the creation of a User-End ANCP feature is 
       the ability to run two satellite modems back-to-back, allowing the 
       User-End ANCP to run independently, with each end controlling the 
       outbound traffic between CPE router (RTR) and Satellite Modem (SM). 

     
        
                    User-End Access Node

                       | RTR |-| SM  |---|     |-- - - 
                       +-----+ +-----+   |     | 
                                         | SAT |  
                       +-----+ +-----+   |(RF) |  
                       | RTR |-| SM  |---|     |-- - - 
                       +-----+ +-----+   +-----+ 
                   User-End Access Node 
                    Control Mechanism

                  Figure 3 Point-to-Point User-End ANCP Framework 

       In this case, the Policy Server component resides within the CPE 
       router, in the form of policy lists that the router chooses between, 
       depending on variables supplied by the ANCP process. 

       Again it is important to note that in Figure 3, it is just as 
       feasible to have terrestrial radios in the place of the satellite 
       modems and satellite repeater. 

    3.4. Framework for Bidirectional User-End ANCP  

       In some cases, there may be a requirement for knowledge of the 
       incoming rates from the modem.  This would be particularly important 
       if the information is required for call admission control for e.g. 
       Voice over IP, further up the protocol stack.  This is applicable to

       to-point and hub-spoke scenarios.

    Extension of ANCP for Satellite and Terrestrial Modem Networks June 2007 
        

       There are two approaches to solving this problem.  Either another 
       protocol is created to allow instances of ANCP in the RTR and NAS to 
       share information (or between RTR instances in the point-to-point 
       case).  Alternatively, ANCP instances in the satellite modem and 
       satellite hub can send simultaneous information updates to both the 
       RTR and NAS device. 

       Note that control requests from the router to the modem are probably 
       not required, as there is little that a router needs to configure on 
       the input as far as traffic shaping is concerned.  However, if a 
       router is provisioned with different differentiated services code 
       points (DSCP), it may be helpful to pass the mapping of those 
       codepoints, and how to treat packets using them, down to the modem. 
       Consideration of DSCP control requests is outside the scope of this 
       document.

    4. Security Considerations 

       At this stage we do not see any extra security issues over and above 
       the existing use of ANCP. 

        

    5. IANA Considerations 

       No IANA considerations have been raised at this time. 

        

    6. Conclusions 

       This document outlines how the use of ANCP can be extended over and 
       above its initial deployment, namely into the satellite and 
       terrestrial wireless modem markets.  There are varying degrees to 
       which ANCP can be used within these markets.  The satellite hub-and-
       spoke topology is similar to the DSL hub-and-modem topology, so it is 
       a natural fit with ANCP, and we believe that ANCP could be adopted 
       for satellite ISPs quite easily. 

       Modifications to how ANCP is deployed would also allow it to be used 
       in the satellite and terrestrial point-to-point markets, solving the 
       ongoing issue of how to traffic shape-services when passing over 
       dynamic modem links that vary in offered speed.
