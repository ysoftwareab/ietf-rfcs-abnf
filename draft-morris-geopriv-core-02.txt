Abstract 
    
   The working group has generally agreed that the Geopriv Location 
   Object MUST be able to contain a limited set of Privacy Rules.   This 
   Internet-Draft suggests the set of Privacy Rules that the authors 
   believe should be includable in the Location Object.

1. Overview and Notes on Revisions 
    
   The authors believe that there exists working group consensus that 
   that the Geopriv Location Object (LO) MUST be able to contain a 
   limited set of Privacy Rules.  This document suggests the set of 
   Privacy Rules that the authors believe should be includable in the 
   Location Object. 
    
   The threshold question of whether the LO should contain any Privacy 
   Rules was discussed at IETF-55 in Atlanta.  A brief explanation as to 
   why a limited set of Privacy Rules should be includable in the LO is 
   set out in Section 5 below.  
    
   The -00 version of this document was discussed at IETF-55 in Atlanta.  
   The -01 version significantly reorganized the proposed rules, and was 
   discussed at IETF-56 in San Francisco.  This -02 version refines the 
   Privacy Rules proposal based on in person and mailing list 
   discussion.  The main changes from the -01 version are: 
    
        * the prior draft placed the proposed privacy elements into two 
   categories:  "Human- AND Machine-Readable Privacy" (including 
   elements that can be distributed to any of the entities in a Geopriv 
   transaction) and "Machine-Readable Privacy Elements" (including 
   elements that can only be sent from one Location Server to another 
   Location Server).  Concern was raised by the idea of "human readable" 
   elements, and these categories have been changed to respond to the 
   concerns raised. 
    
        * the prior draft proposed that rules could be made specific to 
   individuals (Element D, for example, "give my location to my mother 
   at any time, but give my location to my boss only at these certain 
   times), AND, separately, specific to presenters of a credential 
    
   Morris, Mulligan, Cuellar                                         2 
                       Core Privacy Protections               June 2003 
   (Element E, for example, "give my location to anyone who presents XYZ 
   credential).  A concern was expressed about the difficultly of 
   establishing identity independent of a credential.  In other words, 
   assuming the absence of a credential (which is permitted with Element 
   E), verifying an identity (as in Element D) would be very difficult.  
   To address this concern, the old Element D has been eliminated.  The 
   old Element E has been modified to suggest that in designing the 
   Location Object, it is possible that a concept of "identity" may be 
   used merely as an index into a table of credentials, but such a use 
   of "identity" would not be a requirement for the Location Object. 
    
    
2. Conventions used in this document 
    
   Terms with initial capitals (such as, for example, "Location Object," 
   "Privacy Rule," and "Viewer") have the same meaning as defined in the 
   Geopriv Requirements document, draft-ietf-geopriv-reqs-03.txt. 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1]. 
    
    
3. Privacy Rules to be Includable in a Geopriv Location Object 
    
   This section details two groups of core elements of Privacy Rules 
   that should be expressible in the Geopriv Location Object.  For each 
   of the core elements (designated as Elements A through L), a more 
   precisely stated "rule" is also provided, with Elements D through L 
   being stated in a permissions table as part of a single rule.  
   Section 4 below contains some additional substantive discussion of 
   these elements. 
    
   Note that some of the elements and rules discussed below are phrased 
   in terms of prohibitions ("do not disclose except to . . ."), but 
   could probably as effectively be phrased in terms of permissions 
   ("permitted to disclosed only to . . . "). 
    
    
3.1. Widely Distributable Privacy Elements and Rules 
    
   This first group of privacy elements and resulting rules represent 
   the most basic Privacy Rules, and can be transmitted between and 
   among any of the entities in a Geopriv transaction.   
    
   Two different forms of this first group would be defined - a compact 
   form suitable for low bandwidth applications, and a more verbose 
   default form that could possibly be transmitted to the Viewer (i.e., 
   the final recipient of Location Information).  This latter approach 
   would permit, for example, the return of a Location Object in 
   response to a HTTP request from a web browser. 
    

    
   Morris, Mulligan, Cuellar                                         3 
                       Core Privacy Protections               June 2003 
   The three privacy elements in this group are: 
    
      Element A:  Requirement that external privacy rules be followed 
       
      Element B:  Limitation on length of data retention 
       
      Element C:  Limitation on any retransmission or further 
                  disclosure 
       
   The following expresses these three broad elements in more precise 
   language: 
       
      Rule 1:     Do not retransmit or further disclose my location 
                  information except in full compliance with the 
                  privacy rules located at [url/uri]. (Element A) 
       
      Rule 2:     Do not retain my location information [past xyz 
                  time+date OR longer than xyz duration]. (Element B) 
       
      Rule 3:     Do not retransmit or further disclose my location 
                  information. (Element C) 
    
    
3.2. LS-to-LS Privacy Elements and Rules 
    
   The second group of Privacy Rules that can be contained in a LO is 
   intended for use in transmissions between Location Servers.  
    
   The authors believe that, taken together, Elements A - L would allow 
   the expression of a very high percentage of users' complete set of 
   Privacy Rules, and thus in many cases could obviate the need for 
   reference to any external set of Privacy Rules. 
    
   The privacy elements in this group are: 
    
      Element D:  [deleted] 
       
      Element E:  Permission to disclose only to someone presenting a 
                  specified key (for instance, a shared key or the 
                  private key corresponding to a particular public 
                  key), or a special type of credential (an e-token to 
                  be defined). 
       
      Element F:  Requirement that the granularity/precision of 
                  location information be reduced 
       
      Element G:  The ability to provide additional Privacy Rules for 
                  specific requestors or groups of requestors 
       
      Element H:  The ability to define a time until which a permission 
                  is valid

                       Core Privacy Protections               June 2003 
      Element I:  The ability to define a geographical area for which 
                  the permission is valid ("if I am in area x then you 
                  can tell y my location") 
       
      Element J:  The ability to define a repeatable time window (such 
                  as weekdays during office hours) during which a 
                  permission is valid 
       
      Element K:  The ability to require that express consent of the 
                  Target/Rule Maker be obtained prior to disclosing 
                  location 
       
      Element L:  The ability to require that notice be provided to the 
                  Target if location is provided 
    
    
   Elements E through L can be expressed in the form of a single 
   permissions table: 
       
      Rule 4:     Do not retransmit or further disclose my location 
                  information EXCEPT in accordance to the following 
                  permissions table: 
       
   |Credent/Ident|Accuracy|Policy|Valid|LocRes|TimeRes|Consent|Notice| 
   |             |        |      |     |      |       |       |      | 
   | xyz1 [id1]  |  uvw1  |  p1  | v1  |  r1  |  t1   |  c1   |  n1  | 
   | xyz2 [id2]  |  uvw2  |  p2  | v2  |  r2  |  t2   |  c2   |  n2  | 
   | xyz3 [id3]  |  uvw3  |  p3  | v3  |  r3  |  t3   |  c3   |  n3  | 
   | xyz4 [id4]  |  uvw4  |  p4  | v4  |  r4  |  t4   |  c4   |  n4  | 
       
                  where 
    
        xyz     Credential: allows for wildcards and "no additional 
                credential required beyond [abc] identity" (Element E) 
         
        [id]    A non-required possible identity label that can be used 
                to provide an index into the credential table (for 
                example, "here is my xyz credential, and you will locate 
                that credential indexed by [id] in your table") 
         
        uvw     Accuracy: has one of the following values (Element F): 
                A = no granularity change required 
                B = 10 kilometer radius (or within lat/long quadrant) 
                C = 100 kilometer radius (or within larger quadrant) 
                D = local or municipal civil designation (e.g., city) 
                E = state or regional civil designation (e.g., state) 
                F = national designation (e.g., country) 
                G = time zone 
    
        p       Policy: pointer to the privacy rules/policy that must be 
                followed for this specific Location Seeker (Element G)

        v       Validity: this permission is valid until time v (Element 
                H) 
         
        r       Location Restriction:  r represents a region where this 
                permission applies (for instance, if I am in Munich, 
                then it is OK to pass this information) (Element I) 
         
        t       Time Restriction: this permission is only valid within 
                the recurring time window t (for instance, only during 
                working hours may my boss obtain my location) (Element 
                J) 
         
        c       Consent Bit: ask me for permission in real time (and let 
                the Location Seeker abc wait until I tell you) (Element 
                K) 
         
        n       Notification Bit: send me a notification if you send 
                this Location Information to Location Seeker abc 
                (Element L) 
         
         
4. Additional Discussion of Proposed Privacy Elements and Rules 
    
   The following are additional comments and explanations of the above 
   privacy elements and rules: 
    
        a.  Rules 1 - 3 should be expressible in both a compact form 
   and a form that would be intelligible to a human viewer.  Rule 4 is 
   primarily intended to be read by Location Servers that have 
   sufficient intelligence to process the rules.  When sending Location 
   Information to an ultimate Viewer, it is possible that the Geopriv 
   Location Object (LO) itself would need to contain human-readable 
   information (for example, if the LO is sent to a Viewer using SMTP or 
   HTTP).  This approach is analogous to the full and compact versions 
   of privacy policies under P3P. 
    
        b.  Element C and Rule 3 could possibly be omitted as a separate 
   flag or field, because a "do not distribute" instruction should be a 
   fundamental default for the Geopriv Location Object.  Nevertheless, 
   there is value in having an express "do not redistribute" indicator, 
   especially to emphasize that instruction to an ultimate Viewer (who, 
   as discussed above, may well be a human receiving the LO essentially 
   directly). 
    
        c.  To be clear, the proposal of making specific Privacy Rules 
   includable in a Location Object does NOT mean that all of the 
   proposed privacy rules would be transmitted in every Location Object 
   within a given location transaction.  It is quite possible that a LO 
   at an early stage of a location transaction might carry full 
   specifics on Rules 1 - 4.  But a later stage of the same location 
   transaction (say, from a Location Server to an ultimate Viewer) might 


    
   Morris, Mulligan, Cuellar                                         6 
                       Core Privacy Protections               June 2003 
   only carry Rules 1 - 3 (which would be the only rules directly 
   applicable to the Viewer). 
    
    
5. Reasons to Include Privacy Rules in Location Object 
    
   It is not the purpose of this Internet-Draft to explain in full the 
   reasons why a limited set of Privacy Rules should be includable in 
   the Location Object.  A brief discussion, however, may assist a 
   reader who is unfamiliar with past working group discussions on the 
   topic.  
    
   A critical question that faced the Geopriv working group was whether 
   the Location Object (LO) to be designed should include fields for 
   particular privacy-protecting rules, or instead should simply refer 
   to an external set of privacy rules.  The three most plausible 
   answers to this question would be: 
    
        (1)  "Entirely External" -- the LO should only contain a URI 
             reference to an external set of privacy rules that must be 
             followed by any recipient of the LO. 
         
        (2)  "Limited Internal" -- the LO should contain a limited set 
             of rules that cover the great bulk of likely privacy 
             situations (as well as the ability to include a URI 
             reference to an external set of privacy rules if more 
             robust rules are needed, or external rule storage is 
             preferred). 
 
        (3)  "Full Internal" -- the LO should be defined to be able to 
             contain a full, robust, and potentially complex set of 
             privacy rules. 
    
   The "Full Internal" option would yield the most complex LO, would be 
   the most complex to define and implement, and may not be consistent 
   with the goal of enabling the use of the Geopriv LO on constrained 
   devices or with limited bandwidth. 
    
   The "Entirely External" approach would be the quickest for the 
   working group to accomplish, and if fully implemented in the 
   marketplace this approach could give end users a great deal of 
   control and flexibility in the protection of Location Information.  
   Under this approach, however, privacy protection would heavily depend 
   on marketplace developments wholly external to the work of Geopriv, 
   and thus may not fulfill the mission of the working group as defined 
   by its charter. 
    
   Certain working group participants (including the authors here) 
   argued that the most effective way to ensure that users have some 
   privacy control is for the Location Object to be able to carry a 
   limited number of privacy rules.  In discussions at IETF-55 in 
   Atlanta, the working group agreed to pursue the "Limited Internal" 

    
   Morris, Mulligan, Cuellar                                         7 
                       Core Privacy Protections               June 2003 
   approach, although the group did not determine the precise elements 
   to be included in a "Limited Internal" approach.  It is to this 
   latter question that this document is addressed. 
    
   Note that the "Limited Internal" approach is effectively a superset 
   of the "Entirely External" approach, so that both of those models 
   could be implemented in appropriate situations even if the LO can 
   carry a larger set of rules.  Thus, where a particular location 
   service application in fact offers users robust and effective means 
   to create and maintain an external set of privacy rules, that 
   application could simply transmit the URI/URL of those external rules 
   in the Location Object.  But where an application lacks robust and 
   effective external rule servers, the "Limited Internal" approach 
   would allow a core set of rules to be carried with the LO. 
    
    
6. Additional Suggested Requirement for Location Object 
    
   This section is retained here to avoid losing track of the proposal 
   made below (which could be incorporated in the definition of the LO). 
    
   The -00 version of this document proposed one element (the original 
   Element G described below) that was decided to be useful, but not 
   actually a "privacy rule."  The apparent consensus was to instead 
   designate the proposed functionality simply as a feature to be 
   included in a final definition of a Geopriv Location Object.  The 
   resulting proposal is that the LO should be able to contain the 
   following instruction:  
    
        Promptly transmit my location to [abc] individual or entity, 
        along with [xyz] instruction (where the contents of [xyz] are 
        NOT defined by Geopriv except for technical parameters such as 
        maximum size). 
    
   Although this proposal does not itself directly advance a privacy 
   objective, it would greatly facilitate the future development of 
   privacy protecting (and other) business models.  It would also 
   promote the ability of a Target to bypass the location services 
   offered by a Location Generator (such as a wireless carrier) in favor 
   of location services offered by a competitive third party. 
    
    
7. Security Considerations 
    
   Security is, of course, is a core goal of the Geopriv working group.  
   The questions addressed in this Internet-Draft -- what privacy rules 
   should be includable in the Geopriv Location Object -- have 
   significant security implications, most directly on the security of 
   the privacy rules themselves.  The inappropriate disclosure of some 
   privacy rules could itself harm privacy, and thus a decision to 
   include some privacy rules in the Location Object could expose those 
   rules to a higher chance of security (and thus privacy) violation.  

    
   Morris, Mulligan, Cuellar                                         8 
                       Core Privacy Protections               June 2003 
   On the other hand, if including rules in the Location Object 
   increases the likelihood that those privacy rules would in fact be 
   known and followed, then the added security risk of transmitting 
   those rules may be outweighed by the added privacy protection
