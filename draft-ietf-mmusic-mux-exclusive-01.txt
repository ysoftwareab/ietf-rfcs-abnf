1.  Introduction

   [RFC5761] defines how to multiplex RTP and RTCP on a single address
   and port, referred to as RTP/RTCP multiplexing.  [RFC5761] also
   defines an Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] attribute,
   'rtcp-mux' that can be used by entities to indicate support, and
   negotiate usage of, RTP/RTCP multiplexing.

   As defined in [RFC5761], if the peer endpoint does not support RTP/
   RTCP multiplexing, there must be a fallback to usage of separate
   ports for RTP and RTCP.

   The RTCWEB WG has defined that support of the fallback mentioned
   above is optional.  Therefore, there is a need for a mechanism that
   allows an endpoint to indicate exclusive support of RTP/RTCP
   multiplexing, meaning that endpoint only supports RTP/RTCP
   multiplexing and is not able to fallback to usage of separate ports
   for RTP and RTCP.

   This document defines a new SDP media-level attribute, 'rtcp-mux-
   exclusive', that can be used to indicate exclusive support of RTP/
   RTCP multiplexing.

   The document also describes the Interactive Connectivity
   Establishment (ICE) [I-D.ietf-ice-rfc5245bis] considerations when
   indicating exclusive support of RTP/RTCP multiplexing.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  SDP rtcp-mux-exclusive Attribute

   This section defines a new SDP media-level attribute, 'rtcp-mux-
   exclusive'.


          Name: rtcp-mux-exclusive

          Value:

          Usage Level: media

          Charset Dependent: no

          Example:

              a=rtcp-mux-exclusive


   In an SDP offer, the offerer uses the SDP 'rtcp-mux-exclusive'
   attribute to indicate exclusive support of RTP/RTCP multiplexing for
   the RTP-based media associated with the SDP media description ("m="
   line).

   In an SDP answer, the 'rtcp-mux-exclusive' attribute indicates that
   the answerer supports, and accepts usage of, RTP/RTCP multiplexing
   for the RTP-based media associated with the SDP media description
   ("m=" line).

   The usage of the SDP 'rtcp-mux-exclusive' attribute is only defined
   for RTP-based media.

   The SDP offer/answer [RFC3264] procedures associated with the
   attribute are defined in Section 4

4.  SDP Offer/Answer Procedures

4.1.  General

   This section defines the SDP offer/answer [RFC3264] procedures for
   indicating exclusive support of, and negotiating usage of, RTP/RTCP
   multiplexing.



Holmberg                 Expires August 9, 2016                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft           Exclusive RTP/RTCP Mux            February 2016


   The procedures in this section apply to individual RTP-based SDP
   media descriptions ("m=" lines).

4.2.  Generating the Initial SDP Offer

   When an offerer sends the initial offer, if the offerer wants to
   indicate exclusive RTP/RTCP multiplexing for RTP-based media, the
   offerer MUST associate an SDP 'rtcp-mux-exclusive' attribute with the
   associated SDP media description ("m=" line).

   In addition, if the offerer associates an SDP 'rtcp-mux-exclusive'
   attribute with an SDP media description ("m=" line), the offerer MUST
   also associate an SDP 'rtcp-mux' attribute with the same SDP media
   description ("m=" line), following the procedures in [RFC5761].

   If the offerer associates an SDP 'rtcp' attribute [RFC3605] with an
   SDP media description ("m=" line), and if the offerer also associates
   an SDP 'rtcp-mux-exclusive' attribute with the same SDP media
   description ("m=" line), the address and port values of the SDP
   'rtcp' attribute MUST match the corresponding values for RTP.

   NOTE: This specification does not mandate the usage of the SDP 'rtcp'
   attribute for RTP/RTCP multiplexing.

4.3.  Generating the Answer

   When an answerer receives an offer that contains an SDP 'rtcp-mux-
   exclusive' attribute, associated with an RTP-based SDP media
   description ("m=" line), if the answerer accepts the usage of RTP/
   RTCP multiplexing, the answerer MUST associate an SDP 'rtcp-mux-
   exclusive' attribute with the corresponding SDP media description
   ("m=") in the associated answer.  If the answerer does not accept the
   usage of RTP/RTCP multiplexing, the answerer MUST either reject the
   SDP media description ("m=") by setting the port value to zero in the
   associated answer, or reject the whole offer, following the
   procedures in [RFC3264].

   In addition, if the answerer associates an SDP 'rtcp-mux-exclusive'
   attribute with an SDP media description ("m=" line) in the answer,
   the answerer MUST also associate an SDP 'rtcp-mux' attribute with the
   same SDP media description ("m=" line), following the procedures in
   [RFC5761].

4.4.  Offerer Processing of the SDP Answer

   If an offerer associated an SDP 'rtcp-mux-exclusive' attribute with
   an RTP-based SDP media description ("m=" line) in an offer, and if
   the corresponding SDP media description ("m=" line) in the associated

Internet-Draft           Exclusive RTP/RTCP Mux            February 2016


   answer contains an SDP 'rtcp-mux-exclusive' attribute, and/or an SDP
   'rtcp-mux' attribute, the offerer MUST apply the RTP/RTCP
   multiplexing procedures [RFC5761] to the associated RTP-based media.
   If the corresponding SDP media description ("m=" line) in the
   associated answer does not contain an SDP 'rtcp-mux-exclusive'
   attribute, nor an SDP 'rtcp-mux' attribute, the offerer MUST either
   take appropriate actions in order to disable the associated RTP-based
   media, or send a new offer without associating an SDP 'rtcp-mux-
   exclusive' attribute with the SDP media description ("m=" line).

   NOTE: This document does not mandate specific actions on how to
   terminate the RTP media.  The offerer might e.g. send a new offer,
   where the port value of the SDP media description is set to zero, in
   order to terminate the RTP media.

4.5.  Modifying the Session

   When an offerer sends a subsequent offer, if the offerer and answerer
   have previously negotiated usage of RTP/RTCP multiplexing for the
   media associated with an RTP-based SDP media description ("m=" line)
   using the SDP 'rtcp-mux-exclusive' attribute, the offerer SHOULD
   associate an SDP 'rtcp-mux-exclusive' attribute and an SDP 'rtcp-mux'
   attribute with the corresponding SDP media description ("m=" line).
   If the offerer does not associate the attributes with the
   corresponding SDP media description ("m=" line) it is an indication
   that the offerer no longer wants to use RTP/RTCP multiplexing, and
   instead MUST fallback to usage of separate ports for RTP and RTCP
   once the offer has been accepted by the answerer.

   When an offerer sends a subsequent offer, if the offerer and answerer
   have not previously negotiated usage of RTP/RTCP multiplexing for the
   media associated with an RTP-based SDP media description ("m=" line),
   the offerer MAY indicate exclusive support of RTP/RTCP multiplexing,
   following the procedures in Section 4.2.  The offerer MUST process
   the associated answer following the procedures in Section 4.4.

   NOTE: It is RECOMMENDED to not switch between usage of RTP/RTCP
   multiplexing and usage of separate ports for RTP and RTCP in a
   subsequent offer, unless there is a use-case that mandates it.

5.  ICE Considerations

   As defined in [I-D.ietf-ice-rfc5245bis], if an entity is aware that
   the remote peer supports, and is willing to use, RTP/RTCP
   multiplexing, the entity will only provide RTP candidates (component
   ID 1).  However, only providing RTP candidates does not as such imply
   exclusive support of RTP/RTCP multiplexing.  RTCP candidates would
   not be provided also in cases where RTCP is not supported at all.

Internet-Draft           Exclusive RTP/RTCP Mux            February 2016


   Therefore, additional information is needed in order to indicate
   support of exclusive RTP/RTCP multiplexing.  This document defines
   such mechanism using the SDP 'rtcp-mux-exclusive' attributes.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce new security considerations in
   additions to those specified in [RFC3605] and [RFC5761].

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates the "Session Description Protocol Parameters"
   registry as specified in Section 8.2.2 of [RFC4566].  Specifically,
   it adds the SDP 'rtcp-mux-exclusive' attribute to the table for SDP
   media level attributes.


       Attribute name: rtcp-mux-exclusive
       Type of attribute: media-level
       Subject to charset: no
       Purpose: Indicate exclusive support of RTP/RTCP multiplexing
       Appropriate Values: N/A
