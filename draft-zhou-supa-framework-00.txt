    The Framework of Shared Unified Policy Automation (SUPA)
                    draft-zhou-supa-framework-00

Abstract

   Currently, there are a lot of network services that impose specific
   demands on a communication network, which makes it significantly
   more challenging to network management and service deployment. SUPA
   aims to provide a set of data models and a framework to simply the
   deployment and management of network services. This document
   describes the SUPA basic framework and its elements. The main SUPA
   framework entities are the Operation and Management Application
   (OAMA) and the Management Agent (MA). OAMA is a functional entity
   that creates and runs network services; MA is a functional entity
   which enables the generation, maintenance and release of network
   topologies and network service specific abstractions, and maps
   network service specific abstractions in combination with network
   topology and policy to detail network element configurations.

1. Introduction

   As the Internet grows, more and more new services keep on arising,
   and network traffic is rapidly increased, which makes network
   management and configuration more and more complicated, while on the
   other hand, dynamic and real-time configuration change is required,
   e.g. Inter-Data Center (DC) traffic steering and tunneling, based on
   real-time network status. Network applications can be used to
   automate the complicated and dynamic network configuration. For this
   goal, data models of network topology, data models of network
   services, data model of network service development policies are
   very necessary. Providing these data models to applications may

   provide significant improvements in configuration agility, error
   detection and uptime for operators.

   However the real value behind these configuration schemes lies
   within the possible simplification through abstract models provided
   by such systems to applications and network services running above
   them (on the so-called northbound side). Well-designed simplified
   models are able to provide a wide range of granularity for various
   applications and network services needs, from the lower-level
   physical network to high-level application services.

   An abstract view of a network infrastructure can be realized using
   network topology data model. The more accurate and detailed network
   topology contains the details Protocol Layer 0 to Protocol Layer 7
   (L0-L7) of network topology of a network infrastructure. This is the
   case where resources across different layers including application
   layer (L7), IP/network layer (L3), and lower layers (L0-L2), e.g.,
   MPLS, SDH, OTN, WDM). The network resources may include physical
   and/or virtual network node and links, e.g. routers, switches, and
   VPN, etc.

   Network service data model is service specific, and usually it
   relies on network topology data model. The network service
   contributes to the behavior of the higher layer service, which is
   characterized by at least performance, dependability, and security
   specifications.

   In order to automate service configuration, sometimes it is
   necessary to use a policy data model to tell the network Management
   Agent (MA) how to map network service data model in combination with
   topology data model into detail Network Element (NE) configuration,
   e.g. how to choose a path for VPN which will involve a set of NE's.

   The main goal of this document is to specify the SUPA reference
   framework, its elements and interfaces.

   The technology that can be used for this purpose is based on YANG
   information and data models, see [RFC6020], [RFC6991].

       Figure 1: SUPA Framework

   This section provides an overview of the SUPA framework. An overview
   of the SUPA framework is given in Figure 1. The network entities
   used in this framework are:

      OAMA: Operation and Management Application, represents one or
      more network entities that are running and controlling network
      services.

      MA: Management Agent, represents one or more entities that are
      able to control the operation and management of a network
      infrastructure, e.g., a network topology that consists of
      Network Elements (NEs.)

      Network Element (NE): handles incoming packets based on the
      network management and controlling procedures. NEs can interact
      with local or remote MA in order to exchange information, such
      as configuration information, policy enforcement capabilities,
      and network status.

      BUS: there can be multiple OAMAs and MAs in a large scale
      network, either in a single administrative domain or in multiple
      administrative domains. The communication between OAMAs and MAs
      can make use of a BUS. A BUS can be a message queue service, or
      a dedicated (small) network or VPNs.

   MA exchanges configuration information with NEs and derive the
   actual and detailed network topology model. When an OAMA needs to
   use this network topology it applies NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF
   [ID.draft-ietf-netconf-restconf] and it sends a request to receive a
   service specific abstraction from the MA(s). Subsequently, the MA(s)
   provides a service specific abstraction of the network topology to
   the application, which should be able to meet the requirements
   imposed by this application. Various types of applications may get
   different service specific abstractions of the same network topology
   from MA. For example, for the same actual network topology, a VPN
   network service will receive a different service specific

Internet-Draft          SUPA Architecture            January 2015


   abstraction of the network topology, than an inter-Data Center (DC)
   network service.

   For each network service instance a service specific abstraction
   network topology needs to be generated and maintained. A network
   service can use application based demands and policies, such as
   tunneling or traffic steering, and possibly update its associated
   service specific abstraction network topology. Moreover, by using
   such policies, the application can instruct MA to map the service
   specific abstractions to the actual (detailed) network topology and
   NE specific configuration.



4. Framework Functional Entities


4.1. Operation and Management Application

   There are a wide variety of communication services offered by
   service providers. For each network service instance a service
   specific abstraction network topology needs to be generated and
   maintained.

   The Operation and Management Application (OAMA) is a functional
   entity, residing at the Application layer, which enables network
   services, such as:
      o) Network service, e.g. L2VPN, L3VPN, etc.
      o) Application based policies
      o) Update network topologies associated with each application.

   As part of the SUPA operational procedures, OAMA performs the
   following functions:

      o) OAMA sends a request to MA to get service-specific
      information to create an abstract network topology for a given
      application.

      o) OAMA exchanges necessary information with MA regarding any
      update on the network topology for a given application along
      with service-related policy information (e.g., tunneling or
      traffic-steering policy rules).


4.2. Management Agent

   Figure 2: MA Functional Blocks

   Management Agent (MA) is a functional entity that is able to
   generate, maintain and release:
      1) Detailed network topology of a network infrastructure
      2) Network service-specific network topology.

   Moreover, MA supports the SUPA northbound interface/protocol. It
   also supports a software repository, which stores the information
   associated with each NE. By using application-based demands &
   policies received from the OAMA it can map the service-specific
   network topology and feature specific YANG models to the target
   NE(s). This framework was enhanced to satisfy the demands of the
   SUPA use cases.

   The MA function provides a set of functions, including:
      o) Detailed network topology: maintains an up to date
      description of a detailed network topology that models the
      topology and configuration of the network infrastructure.
      Moreover, it can use existing network management and signaling
      protocols, such as I2RS [I2RS], NETCONF [NETCONF], RESTCONF
      [ID.draft-ietf-netconf-restconf], etc., to request the
      implementation of the changes into the network
      status/configurations.

      o) Network service specific topology: maintains an up to date
      service specific abstraction of the topology of the network
      infrastructure, e.g. VPN service.

      o) Policy Rules for Network Service: the policies can help to
      automate service deployment and management, e.g. a policy when
      the traffic load on a link exceeds a threshold, MA will
      configure an extra link and perform load-balance. MA will
      maintain a repository of policy rules.

      o) Application to Network Mapping: using the application-based
      demands and policy data model received from the OAMA it maps
      service specific network topology to the actual/detailed network

      topology. Moreover, this functional block provides the mapping
      of the actual/detailed network topology to NE/feature-specific
      YANG models.

      o) MA to network management system interface: provides the
      interface with existing network management system, I2RS [I2RS]
      NETCONF, etc. protocols to request and negotiate the
      implementation of the changes into the network
      status/configuration.

      o) MA to OAMA interface: used to support the communication
      between the OAMA and MA. The candidate protocols used for this
      purpose could be either NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [ID.draft-
      ietf-netconf-restconf].


4.3. Network Elements

   The Network Element (NE) handles incoming packets based on the
   policy information communicated with MA and makes corresponding
   policy enforcement, which is based on existing network management
   policies. An NE may be a physical entity or a virtual entity and is
   locally managed, via CLI, SNMP, or NETCONF.

   SUPA will specify mechanisms, in order to enable the NEs to interact
   with either local or remote network management system in order to
   exchange information, such as configuration and status information.
   The NEs will be able to push this information in an event or
   periodic basis towards the network controller or provide it after
   receiving a request from the network controller.


5. Security Considerations

   Security is a key aspect of any protocol that allows state
   installation and extracting of detailed configuration states. More
   investigation remains to fully define the security requirements,
   such as authorization and authentication levels.



6. IANA Considerations

   No IANA considerations.
