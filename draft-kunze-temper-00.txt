Abstract

   TEMPER (TEMPoral Enumerated Ranges) is a simple date and time syntax
   for representing points, lists, and ranges of timestamps.  The syntax
   is designed to be trivial to parse, easy for humans to read, and
   friendly to simple lexical sorting algorithms.  TEMPER consists of
   4-, 8-, and 14-digit points, point ranges, and lists of points and
   ranges.  Examples:

1.  The TEMPER Syntax

   A TEMPER point is a string of characters representing a single date
   or a combination of a date and a time.  Sometimes this is called a
   timestamp.  Here are some examples of TEMPER points.

      1999             The year 1999.
      0384             The year 384.
      20041201         December 1st in the year 2004.
      20040900         The month of September in the year 2004.
      19990916145903   The third second past 2:59 PM, 16 September 1999.

   There are three different lengths of TEMPER points:

      CCYY             4-digit year, with CC being the 2-digit century
      CCYYMMDD         8-digit year-month-day
      CCYYMMDDhhmmss   14-digit day-hour-minute-second

   As a special case, when DD is given as 00 it is treated as if no day
   was given for the specified month.

   A TEMPER range is a start point and an end point separated by a
   hyphen.  An open-ended range is specified when either start or end
   point is absent.  At least one point must be present in a range.  Two
   points in a range must have the same number of digits; e.g., an
   8-digit start point and a 4-digit end point is not a valid TEMPER
   range.  Here are some examples of ranges.

         1998-2004           1998 to 2004
         19960401-19971202   1 April 1996 to 2 December 1997
         2004-               2004 and later
         -1889               up to 1889

   A TEMPER list is one or more points and ranges separated by commas.
   Every point in a list must have the same number of digits; e.g., a
   14-digit point and a 4-digit range end point cannot occur in a valid
   TEMPER list.  Here are some examples of lists.

         1996, 1997, 1998
         1994, 1996-1998, 2000, 2002-2005
         -1889, 1909, 1925-, 2005

   Whitespace is not significant throughout the TEMPER syntax.
   Whitespace may be used for formatting, but will be squeezed out when
   creating canonical forms.  The following TEMPER lists are equivalent.

         1996 04 01 093000 - 1997 12 02 165959, 2005 02 28 220401
         19960401093000 - 19971202165959   , 20050228220401
         1996   0401093000-1997   1202165959,2005   0228220401
         1996 0401   093000-1997 1202   165959,2005 0228   220401
         19960401093000-19971202165959,20050228220401

   Future versions of the TEMPER specification may address such things
   as timezones, fractional dates, approximate dates, and BCE dates.
   Currently disallowed in TEMPER are all constructions not specified
   above and all numerical values with no defined meaning in ordinary
   calendars and clocks.

2.  Security considerations

   The TEMPER syntax poses no direct risk to computers and networks.
   Implementors should always exercise care when receiving data that may
   be private or maliciously intended.  These are normal risks to which
   TEMPER is no more vulnerable than most other syntaxes.  Because of
   its restricted character repertoire, TEMPER dates may actually have
   enhanced security compared to other date syntaxes (e.g., [ISO8601]).
