1. Introduction

   This document outlines a proposal for an administrative oversight
   entity for the collection of activities that allow the IETF to carry
   out the work described in [2].  The specific motivation for the
   proposal can be found in [3], and these were prepared in response to
   the outcome of the IAB Advisory Committee, published in [1].  All 4
   documents must be read for completeness.

   This purpose of this proposal is to present the concepts and
   structural relationship to existing IETF activities.  It deliberately
   remains agnostic about the specific implementation form of any
   eventual organizational structure.  Details and more formal
   procedural guidelines implementing the structure outlined in this
   document will be set out in subsequent formal documents such as
   bylaws and/or constitutional documents, as appropriate to the formal
   structure chosen for implementation.

   Specific goals of this restructuring are to recognize and preserve
   the community-driven nature of the IETF's work, and to continue to
   support it through the formalization of a single administrative
   umbrella that is openly accountable to that same community.

2. Proposal Overview

   This proposal preserves the existing IETF standardization process
   structure, led by the IESG and IAB in their respective roles, and
   introduces a new Administration Group (AG) to carry out the formal
   administration processes of IETF organization.  Like the IAB and the
   IESG, the AG (through its Board) is accountable to the IETF community
   as a whole.

   In short, the responsibilities for the different IETF bodies can be
   characterized as:

      IAB:  architecture and longterm technical overview; sponsorship
      and organization of the IRTF; appeals; confirmation of IESG
      appointments; oversight of standards process

      IESG: management of standards work (working groups, documents, and
      process)

      AG:  administrative arm of IETF organization; establishes and
      manages contracts; proposes and executes budget plans; does NOT
      change or influence the standards process

3. IETF Administration Group (AG)

   An IETF Administration Group (AG) is proposed to provide the unified
   administrative management of all IETF supporting functions.  This
   group is ultimately accountable to IETF participants, as described
   below.

   The AG will not replace any existing IETF support structure although
   it subsumes some tasks that have been handled on an ad hoc basis by
   IAB or IESG members or others.  It will rather complement the
   existing work (RFC-Editor, Secretariat, IANA protocol parameter
   assignments), and take on the role of overall coordination and
   management of the administration.  This will permit unification of
   fund-raising activities, flexibility in balancing budget allocations,
   and coherence in management across the functions.

3.1 AG Activities

3.1.1 Administration

   The AG is responsible for the administrative activities associated
   with the IETF organization.  Today, most of the operational work that
   permits the IETF to continue creating and managing standards is done
   by a disparate group of organizations dedicated to the ongoing health
   of the Internet.  It is expected that those organizations will
   continue to do the work as they do today, but the AG will provide
   administrative oversight for the IETF operational process, and will
   give those organizations a clear anchor.  The AG will negotiate and
   formalize contracts with the organizations that provide support for
   IETF functions, and will be responsible for ensuring their timely
   payment and performance review.

3.1.2 Operations

   As part of this activity, the AG will exercise financial control for
   the whole IETF activity -- either handling the funds directly, or
   providing executive oversight for the bodies that do.  The AG will be
   responsible for developing viable financial plans to support the IETF
   activity, to better match revenue and costs across the board of IETF
   support activities.

3.2 AG Composition

   There will be one person designated as the manager of the AG.  This
   person will be selected by  and serve at the pleasure of the Board of
   the AG.

3.3 AG Committees

   The expectation is that the manager of the AG will constitute
   special-purpose, chartered committees to bring in expertise (e.g.,
   financial) or differing perspectives when and as necessary.  These
   committees may consist of subsets of the IAB and/or IESG, selected
   IETF participants, or external experts, depending on the need.

   These committees are advisory in nature -- the manager of the AG is
   responsible for the outcome, including presenting and supporting any
   material to the Board, as and when appropriate.

4. Board of the Administration Group (BAG)

   The BAG provides oversight of the AG's activities, ensuring that they
   are carried out in accordance with the IETF mission, and that
   appropriate operational support is provided for the IAB, IESG,
   working groups, etc, to carry out their chartered work.

4.1 BAG Activities

      Election of Chair and Secretary of the BAG

      Selection of manager of the AG

      Budget approval

      Financial review

      Approval of major contracts and funding proposals

      Publication of audited IETF financials


4.2 BAG Composition

   At a minimum, the BAG will have 5 voting members:

      IETF Chair

      IAB Chair

      3 appointed members with staggered 3 year renewable terms; these
      members are selected by (though not necessarily members of) ISOC,
      the IAB, the IESG.

   The BAG also has, at a minimum,  3 non-voting members:

Internet-Draft          draft-daigle-adminrest-00          February 2004


      manager of the AG

      a representative of the IETF's legal counsel

      a treasurer (if necessary; appointment process TBD)

   The BAG will organize itself to elect a Secretary and a Chair for
   one-year, renewable appointments.  The Secretary may be any BAG
   member; the Chair must be a voting member of the BAG.

   Although appointed by ISOC, the IAB and IESG, the BAG is accountable
   directly to the IETF community.  At any time, a recall against an
   appointed BAG member may be proposed by members of the IETF community
   (procedure to be defined).  Once a BAG member has been recalled, they
   are ineligible to be re-appointed (for a period analogous to that
   outlined in [4]).

5. Security Considerations

   This document does not discuss Internet protocols, and thereby
   introduces no security issues for their operation.
