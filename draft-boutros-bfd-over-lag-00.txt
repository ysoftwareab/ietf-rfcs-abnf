Abstract                                                     

   The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol is used to 
   detect faults on interfaces and data links. This document describes 
   a mechanism to run a BFD async session per member link of a Link 
   Aggregation (LAG) interface, BFD would be able to run at a much 
   aggressive rate then Link aggregation control protocol (LACP), and 
   can run in the absence of LACP, and would be able to verify L3 
   connectivity per member link.

1. Introduction 

   As described in [BFD], the Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) 
   protocol provides a fast mechanism for detecting communication 
   failures on any data links and the protocol can run over any media 
   and at any protocol layer.  

   Link aggregation as defined in [IEEE 802.1AX] provides mechanisms 
   to combine multiple physical links to a single logical link. The 
   goal is to provide higher bandwidth with the aggregated logical 
   link and better resiliency, since if one of the physical member 
   links fails, the aggregate logical link can continue to forward 
   traffic over the remaining operational physical member links. 

   Currently Link aggregation control protocol (LACP) is used to 
   detect failures on a per physical member link. However, the use of 
   BFD for failure detection would (1) provide a faster detection (2) 
   provide detection in the absence of LACP (3) and would be able to 
   verify L3 connectivity per member link. 

   This document describes how to bootstrap and establish a BFD async 
   session per physical member link of the Link Aggregation (LAG) 
   interface. 

   We propose the use of LSP Ping to bootstrap a BFD session per 
   member link using mechanisms described in [RFC5884].

2. Bootstrapping BFD sessions per physical member link of a LAG 

   LSP Ping will be used to bootstrap a BFD session per physical LAG 
   member.  

   An LSP Ping Echo Request will be sent per physical member link from 
   the source node to the target node, the request will contain a NIL 
   FEC, and a discriminator TLV. 

   The source node connected to the physical member link of the LAG, 
   would wait to see the BFD packet with the discriminator negotiated, 
   the target node MUST send BFD packets with the negotiated 
   discriminator and the source node MUST reply with BFD packets to 
   bring the BFD Async session up on the same member link it received 
   the BFD packets on. 

   In order to send BFD and LSP Ping packets over the member links 
   prior to L2 and L3 coming up, BFD and LSP Ping IP packets will need 
   to use an address from the 127.x range as a destination address, as 
   well the L2 header to be put on BFD/LSP Ping IP packets could be 
   one of the reserved Multicast MAC addresses defined in the scope of 
   [IEEE .1ad] to be the immediate next hop. 

   BFD and LSP Ping IP packets corresponding to a BFD session on a 
   physical member link will be pre-routed to the member link. 

   If both source and target nodes initiate an LSP Ping Echo request 
   to start a BFD session on a member link, each node MUST use the 
   same discriminator value of the other node in the BFD session on 
   this physical member link, this will make sure that we have one BFD 
   session per member link. 

   LSP Ping may be used for L3 address discovery prior to L3 coming 
   up, since if one side initiate the Echo request with its source 
   address, and 127.x destination address on a given physical member 
   link, the reply coming back on the same physical member link will 
   have the other side source address. 

3. Scenarios 

   Assume 2 nodes A and B are connected via a LAG interface that has 3 
   member links link 1, 2 and 3, further assume that all member links 
   in the LAG interface are active. 

3.1. Bootstrapping BFD sessions  

   Node A will send an LSP Ping Echo request on Link-1, by adding

   1- A NIL FEC. 

   2- Specifying a discriminator value corresponding to Link-1. 

   3- The ip destination address on the packet will be picked from the 
   127.x range. 

   The LSP Ping echo request will then be encaped with a L2 header, by 
   setting the destination mac to one of the reserved Multicast MAC 
   addresses defined in the scope of [IEEE 802.1ad]. 

   Node B receives the LSP Ping Echo request, and may send an Echo 
   reply with its ip address to Node A. 

   Node B starts a BFD session using the negotiated discriminator 
   value in the BFD control packets. B then encapsulates the BFD 
   packets with a L2 header setting the destination mac to one of the 
   reserved Multicast MAC addresses defined in the scope of [IEEE 
   802.1ad]. 

   Once Node A sees the BFD control packets coming on member Link-1, 
   Node A must reply to those BFD control packet on the same member 
   Link-1, negotiation MUST follow the same procedures defined in 
   [BFD] and [BFD-IP]. 

   Node A will then repeat all the above on Link-2 and Link-3, 
   specifying a new discriminator value for each Link. 

    

3.2. Detecting a Link failure 

   In the above scenario assume that Link-2 failed, once BFD detects 
   the failure on both node-A and node-B, each node will update its 
   forwarding table to remove the down link from the aggregation so 
   traffic can follow only on the remaining links 1 and 3. 

4. IANA Considerations 

   TBD 

5. Security Considerations 

   The proposal introduced in this document does not introduce any new 
   security considerations beyond that already apply to the base BFD 
   specification [BFD] and [BFD-IP].
