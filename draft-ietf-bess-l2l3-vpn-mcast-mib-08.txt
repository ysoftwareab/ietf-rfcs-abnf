1.  Introduction

   The procedures for supporting multicast in Border Gateway Protocol/
   MultiProtocol Label Switching (BGP/MPLS) Layer 3 (L3) Virtual Private
   Network (VPN) are specified in [RFC6513].  The procedures for
   supporting multicast in Border Gateway Protocol/MultiProtocol Label
   Switching Layer 2 (L2) Virtual Private Network are specified in
   [RFC7117].  Throughout this document, we will use the term
   "L2L3VPNMCast" to mean BGP/MPLS L2 and L3 VPN that support multicast.

   This document describes textual conventions (TCs) and common managed
   objects (MOs) which will be used by other Management Information Base
   (MIB) modules for monitoring and/or configuring L2L3VPNMCast.

   L2L3VPNMCast can be achieved by using various kinds of transport
   mechanisms for forwarding a packet to all or a subset of Provider
   Edge routers (PEs) across service provider networks.  Such transport
   mechanisms are referred to as provider tunnels (P-tunnels).  The
   signaling of P-tunnel choice is very similar for multicast in both L2
   and L3 VPNs.  Therefore, TCs and MOs defined in this document will be
   used by other MIB modules for monitoring and/or configuring both L2
   and L3 VPNs that support multicast.

   The are two type of the signaling mechanisms of P-tunnel choice: BGP-
   based and UDP-based [RFC6513].  BGP-based mechanisms for Virtual
   Private LAN Service and Multicast VPN (MVPN) are described in
   [RFC7117] and [RFC6513], respectively.  In [RFC6513], a UDP-based
   signaling mechanism is also specified.

Internet-Draft             L2L3-VPN-MCAST MIB                   May 2017


   A BGP attribute that specifies information of a P-tunnel is called
   Provider Multicast Service Interface (PMSI) tunnel attribute.  The
   PMSI tunnel attribute is advertised/received by PEs in BGP auto-
   discovery (A-D) routes.  [RFC6514] defines the format of a PMSI
   tunnel attribute.

   This document defines four TCs to represent

   (a) the tunnel type of a P-tunnel,
   (b) the identifier of a P-tunnel,
   (c) the pointer to a row in some table pertaining to a P-tunnel, and
   (d) the type of the pointer in (c) above,

   respectively.

   This document also describes common MOs that provide the information
   in a PMSI tunnel attribute and corresponding tunnel information to
   other MIB modules.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.1.  Terminology

   This document adopts the definitions, acronyms and mechanisms
   described in [RFC6513] [RFC6514] [RFC7117] and other documents that
   they refer to.  Familiarity with Multicast, MPLS, Layer 3 VPN, MVPN
   (Multicast VPN) concepts and/or mechanisms is assumed.  Some terms
   specifically related to this document are explained below.

   The term "Multicast VPN (MVPN)" [RFC6513] refers to a BGP/MPLS Layer
   3 (IP) VPN service that supports multicast.

   "Provider Multicast Service Interface (PMSI)" [RFC6513] is a
   conceptual interface instantiated by a P-tunnel, a transport
   mechanism used to deliver multicast traffic.  A PE uses it to send
   customer multicast traffic to all or some PEs in the same VPN.

   There are two kinds of PMSIs: "Inclusive PMSI (I-PMSI)" and
   "Selective PMSI (S-PMSI)" [RFC6513].  An I-PMSI is a PMSI that
   enables a PE attached to a particular MVPN to transmit a message to
   all PEs in the same VPN.  An S-PMSI is a PMSI that enables a PE
   attached to a particular MVPN to transmit a message to some of the
   PEs in the same VPN.

   Throughout this document, we will use the term "PMSI" to refer both
   "I-PMSI" and "S-PMSI."

Internet-Draft             L2L3-VPN-MCAST MIB                   May 2017


   [RFC6513] describes the following tunnel setup techniques that can be
   used to create the P-tunnels that instantiate the PMSIs.

   o  Protocol Independent Multicast tree

      *  Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) tree [RFC4601]

      *  Source Specific Multicast (PIM-SSM) tree [RFC4601]

      *  Bidirectional Protocol Independent Multicast (BIDIR-PIM) tree
         [RFC5015]

   o  Label Distribution Protocol Extension for Multipoint Label
      Switched Paths (mLDP) [RFC6388]

      *  Point-to-MultiPoint (mLDP P2MP)

      *  Point-to-MultiPoint (mLDP MP2MP)

   o  Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering Point-to-
      Multipoint (RSVP-TE P2MP) Label Switched Path [RFC4875]

   o  Ingress Replication through Unicast Tunnels [RFC6513]

   A tunnel is identified by its Tunnel Identifier.  The length of the
   identifier will depend on the setup technique that is used to create
   the tunnel.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Summary of MIB Modules

   This document defines two MIB modules: L2L3-VPN-MCAST-TC-MIB and
   L2L3-VPN-MCAST-MIB.

Internet-Draft             L2L3-VPN-MCAST MIB                   May 2017


   o  L2L3-VPN-MCAST-TC-MIB contains four Textual Conventions:
      L2L3VpnMcastProviderTunnelType, L2L3VpnMcastProviderTunnelId,
      L2L3VpnMcastProviderTunnelPointerType, and
      L2L3VpnMcastProviderTunnelPointer.  L2L3VpnMcastProviderTunnelType
      provides an enumeration of the P-tunnel types.
      L2L3VpnMcastProviderTunnelId represents an identifier of a
      P-tunnel.  L2L3VpnMcastProviderTunnelPointerType indicates a type
      of pointer to the row pertaining to a table entry that represents
      a P-tunnel.  L2L3VpnMcastProviderTunnelPointer denotes a pointer
      to the row pertaining to a table entry that represents a P-tunnel.

   o  L2L3-VPN-MCAST-MIB defines a table
      l2L3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelAttributeTable.  An entry in this table
      corresponds to a PMSI Tunnel Attribute (PTA) advertised/received
      by a PE router.  Entries in this table will be used by other MIB
      modules for monitoring and/or configuring L2L3VPNMCast.  The table
      index uniquely identifies a tunnel.  It is composed of a set of
      attributes which depend on the tunnel type.  The table may also be
      used in conjunction with other MIBs, such as MPLS Traffic
      Engineering MIB (MPLS-TE-STD-MIB) [RFC3812], to obtain further
      information of a tunnel by following the row pointer of the
      corresponding tunnel's row in this table.  It may also be used in
      conjunction with Interfaces Group MIB (IF-MIB) [RFC2863] to obtain
      further information of the interface corresponding to the tunnel
      by following the row pointer of the corresponding tunnel's row in
      this table.

5.  Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in these MIB modules that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if
   this MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that
   an intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   Some of the readable objects in these MIB modules (i.e., objects with
   a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive
   or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  the l2L3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelAttributeTable collectively show the
      P-tunnel network topology and its performance characteristics.
      For instance, l2L3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelAttributeId in this table will
      contain the identifier that uniquely identifies a created
      P-tunnel.  This identifier may be composed of source and multicast
      group IP addresses.  l2L3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelPointer and
      l2L3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelIf will point to the corresponding entries



Zhang & Tsunoda         Expires November 27, 2017              [Page 16]

Internet-Draft             L2L3-VPN-MCAST MIB                   May 2017


      in other tables containing configuration and/or performance
      information of a tunnel and an interface.  If an Administrator
      does not want to reveal this information, then these objects
      should be considered sensitive/vulnerable.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to root MIB objects in the MIB module contained in
   this document under the mib-2 subtree.
