Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes a set of managed objects that are used
   to manage for Telephony Routing over IP (TRIP) [RFC3219] devices.

   Since TRIP [RFC3219] is modeled after the Border Gateway Protocol
   (BGP-4) [RFC1771], the managed objects for TRIP are also modeled
   after RFC1657 - Definitions of Managed Objects for the Fourth
   Version of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP-4) using SMIv2
   [RFC1657].

1.   Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB)for use with network management protocols in the Internet
   community. In particular, it describes a set of managed objects that
   are used to schedule management operations periodically or at
   specified dates and times.

2.   Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP-0014
   [BCP0014].

3.   The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC
        1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described
        in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and
        STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of
        the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the
        message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906
        [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of
        protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
        RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
        in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management
   Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of
   the MIB.

4.   Overview

   Telephony Routing over IP (TRIP) [RFC3219] is an inter-domain
   application-layer control protocol that exchanges information
   between TRIP location servers to provide efficient IP telephony
   routing. This MIB provides managed objects for TRIP devices defined
   in Telephony Routing over IP [RFC3219].

5.   Structure of TRIP MIB

   This MIB utilizes the framework described in RFC 2788 [RFC2788] for
   management of multiple instances of TRIP from a single entity. The
   Network Services Monitoring MIB applTable will be populated with
   entries corresponding to each TRIP LS in the system. Each TRIP LS
   will then have an applIndex associated with it. The value assigned
   to applIndex will represent the distinct instance of TRIP.

   The TRIP MIB contains the following groups of objects:
   o The tripConfigGroup contains the common configuration objects
     applicable to all TRIP applications referenced by the applIndex.
   o The tripPeerTableConfigGroup contains the configuration objects
     applicable to all TRIP peers of the LS referened by the applIndex.
   o The tripRouteGroup contains the configuration objects related to
     the routes of all TRIBs of this LS.
   o The tripItadTopologyGroup contains information about the topology
     of the TRIP ITADs concerning this LS.
   o The tripPeerTableStatsGroup contains the statistical objects
     applicable to all TRIP peers of the LS referened by the applIndex.
   o The tripNotificationGroup contains notifications that the TRIP
     application can generate.
   o The tripNotifObjectGroup contains the objects needed by one or
     more of the notifications.

5.1  Textual Conventions

   The data types TripItad and TripId are used as textual conventions
   in this document. A TRIP ITAD is described in [RFC3219]. A TRIP ID
   is used as a distinct identifier for a TRIP LS. A TripAppProtocol is

Zinman/Walker/Jiang                                                   4

   used to identify an application protocol. A TripAddressFamily is
   used to define an address family. Both TripAppProtocol and
   TripAddressFamily are OBJECT IDENTIFIERS and as such, a MIB
   implementor can define a private object of this type of textual
   convention. Objects defined using these conventions are always
   encoded by means of the rules that define their primitive type.
   Hence, no changes to the SMI or the SNMP are necessary to
   accommodate these textual conventions which are adopted merely for
   the convenience of readers.

7.   Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments. The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   The managed objects in this MIB contain sensitive information since,
   collectively, they allow tracing and influencing of connections in
   TRIP devices and provide information of their connection
   characteristics.

   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending
   them over the network via SNMP. Not all versions of SNMP provide
   features for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is
   no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-
   based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.

8.   Revision History

8.1. Changes from <draft-zinman-trip-mib-00.txt>

   o Removed tripRouteAddressLen from the tripRouteTable.
   o Made use of INET-ADDRESS-MIB and it's TC's for IPv6 compliance.
   o Changed order of the enumeration of tripPeerSendReceiveMode to
     comform to TRIP draft.
   o Added objects tripPeerCircuitCapacity and tripPeerDSPCapacity to
     support TRIP for Gateways [24].
   o Removed tripPeerLastError and tripPeerState objects for
     tripEstablished notification.
   o Added local community object.
   o Added communities table for TRIP routes and removed community
     object from route table.
   o Added send/receive capability to local LS.
   o Added tripRouteAddressFamily as an Index to TripRouteEntry.

     OBJECT IDENTIFIER. See [RFC3219] section 13.3
   o Added object identifiers for tripSupportedProtocols and
     tripAddressFamilies.
   o Removed authentication tables.
   o Removed textual convention TripPublicKey.
   o Changed the position of the MIB branches slightly.
   o Changed name of tripPeerLastError to tripNotifPeerErrCode and
     MAX-ACCESS to accessible-for-notify.
   o Separated tripNotifPeerErrSubcode from tripNotifPeerErrCode and
     made them both integers.
   o Added compliance statements.
   o Changed MAX-ACCESS of tripPeerRemoteItad to read-create.
   o Changed DEFVAL of tripPeerHoldTimeConfigured from 90 to 240.

8.3. Changes from <draft-ietf-iptel-trip-mib-00.txt>

   o Changed tripSupportedProtocols and tripAddressFamilies from
     OBJECT IDENTIFIER to OBJECT-IDENTITY.
   o Added tripRouteTRIBMask with syntax BITS to identify the type of
     TRIB the route belongs to.
   o Removed tripMinItadOriginationInterval and
     tripMinRouteAdvertisementInterval from the tripCfgTable because
     they also exist in the Peer table.
   o TripPeerRemoteItad made read-only because either the local
     application will determine the value.

     tripPeerRouteTypeTable).
   o Add timestamp to route table (when received), and last change
     of peer state.
   o Removed tripRouteBest since the best would be represented by
     LocTRIB or AdjTRIBOut
