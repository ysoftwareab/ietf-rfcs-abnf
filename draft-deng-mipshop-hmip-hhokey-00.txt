1.  Introduction

   The Hierarchy Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6) document [I-D.hmipv6] introduces
   the Mobile Anchor Point, which improve the performance of IPv6 in
   terms of handover speed.  The MAP is essentially a local Home Agent,
   and it is located at any level in a hierarchical network of routers.
   The MN only needs to send one Binding Update message to its MAP
   before any traffics form HA and CNs are re-routed to its new place,
   hence significantly improving handover performance.

   Unfortunately, the HMIPv6 document does not specifies a framework for
   authenticating the MN to the networks.  Extensible Authentication
   Protocol (EAP) is suitable do this job for HMIPv6.  When the MN is in
   the visit network, it performs EAP exchanges with the local AAA
   Server which delegates the authentication service of the home AAA
   server.  The Access Router and / or the MAP act as a pass-through
   authenticator.  Although EAP Keying framework [I-D.ietf-eap-keying]
   provides guidelines for generation of the keying meterials, the
   handover keying problem is not solved until we have the Handover Key
   Problem Statement document [I.D.aaa-hokey-ps] and a handover keying
   hierarchy document [I-D.hokey-hierarchy].

   According to the handover keying document, the HMIPv6 architecture is
   suitable to take advantage of the handover keying hierarchy.  The MAP
   resembles the Access Domain Controller (ADC), while the AR is a kind
   of the Access Node.

   Currently use of handover key hierarchy engages in a reactive manner
   in which the Access Node pulls the corresponding key from its
   upstream key holders (e.g. the ADC).  But we argue that in an
   administrative domain, it is suitable and proper to use the handover
   key hierarchy in a proactive manner.  In this document, we define a
   proactive key distribution method (push mode) within the same MAP,
   while the use of the handover keying hierarchy among different MAPs
   is in a reactive mode (pull mode).

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

   The following new terminology and abbreviations are introduced in

   defined in [I-D.ietf-eap-keying] and [I.D.aaa-hokey-ps]

   Push mode

      The proactive mode of key distribution in which the upstream key
      holder distributes the keys for downstream key holders under its
      control in advance.

   Pull mode

      The reactive mode of key distribution in which the downstream key
      holder requests the corresponding key from its upstream key holder
      when they are in need of this key.

3.  Protocol Overview

   The key management within one MAP domain utilizes the push model,
   while key mananagemtn across different MAPs make use of the pull
   mode.  The protocol operations are decribed in the following two
   subsections.

3.1.  Push within MAP

   The handover within one MAP is decribed in Figure 1.  The MN was
   originally authenticated to AR1 with a full EAP exchange.  Then the
   AAA server pushes the corresponding key to the MAP.  According to its
   configuration, the MAP pushes the keys to the ARs within its
   administrative domain.  When the MN attaches to another AR (e.g.  AR2
   in Figure 1), the MN and AR2 assert their knowledge of the
   corresponding LSAP_MK by exchanges of the Secure Association Protocol
   (SAP), after which they arrive at the consensus of the LSK.

3.2.  Pull across MAP

   With our protocol, the handover across different MAPs utilizes the
   pull mode.  The protocol operations are described in Figure 2, which
   is similar to [I-D.hokey-hierarchy].  For simplicity, we omit the ANs
   in Figure 2.

   According to [I-D.hokey-hierarchy], the HoReq sent by MN and HokeyReq
   sent by the MAP is authenticated by the AAA_REAUTH_KEY.  The AAA

   server will validate the authentication payload upon receiving the
   HokeyReq message.  If the validation is successful, the AAA sends out
   the HokeyRep message to the new MAP (e.g.  MAP2), and MAP2 confirms
   its receipt of the handover key by sending out a HokeyConf message to
   MAP1.  MAP1 will also make the MN convinced of the handover by
   sending HoAck message to the MN.  Finally, the MN and MAP2 finish the
   SAP exchanges and establish the communication following up.

4.  Architecture Considerations

   As specified in [I-D.hokey-hierarchy], the ADC may locate off-path or
   on-path with respect to the EAP signalling.  The MAP undergoes the
   same story of the ADC with no exception.

    o  Off-path MAP: The MAP does not necessarily have to be on the EAP
       signaling path.  In the off-path MAP arrangement, the EAP
       authenticator can be located at the serving AN.  One downside of
       this arrangement is that it requires AAA functionality within the
       AN and it requires the AAA server to deal with two different AAA
       clients as part of security provisioning and authentication.  The
       other downside is that there MAY be additional considerations on
       the key distribution protocol between the MAP and AN.

                            Figure 3: Off-path MAP

    o  On-path MAP: The MAP is located on the path of EAP signaling.  In
       the integrated scenario, the pass- through authenticator, AN and
       MAP MAY be located in one physical entity.  In the standalone
       case, where MAP is disjunct from the AN, a choice on placement of
       pass-through authenticator in AN versus in MAP has to be made.
       Placing the pass-through authenticator in the AN is acceptable,
       as long as the AN is able to encapsulate the EAP signaling into
       AAA signaling and the MAP is able to act as a AAA proxy for AAA
       signaling.
