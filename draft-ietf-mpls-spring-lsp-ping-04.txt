 Label Switched Path (LSP) Ping/Traceroute for Segment Routing Networks
                          with MPLS Data-plane
                   draft-ietf-mpls-spring-lsp-ping-04

Abstract

   Segment Routing architecture leverages the source routing and
   tunneling paradigms and can be directly applied to MPLS data plane.
   A node steers a packet through a controlled set of instructions
   called segments, by prepending the packet with a Segment Routing
   header.

   The segment assignment and forwarding semantic nature of Segment
   Routing raises additional consideration for connectivity verification
   and fault isolation in LSP with Segment Routing architecture.  This
   document illustrates the problem and describe a mechanism to perform
   LSP Ping and Traceroute on Segment Routing network over MPLS data
   plane.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing] introduces and explains Segment
   Routing architecture that leverages the source routing and tunneling
   paradigms.  A node steers a packet through a controlled set of
   instructions called segments, by prepending the packet with Segment
   Routing header.  A detailed definition about Segment Routing
   architecture is available in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing]

   As defined in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-mpls], the Segment
   Routing architecture can be directly applied to MPLS data plane in a
   way that, the Segment identifier (Segment ID) will be of 20-bits size
   and Segment Routing header is the label stack.

   "Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data Plane Failures"
   [RFC8029] defines a simple and efficient mechanism to detect data
   plane failures in Label Switched Paths (LSP) by specifying
   information to be carried in an MPLS "echo request" and "echo reply"
   for the purposes of fault detection and isolation.  Mechanisms for
   reliably sending the echo reply are defined.  The functionality
   defined in [RFC8029] is modeled after the ping/traceroute paradigm
   (ICMP echo request [RFC0792]) and is typically referred to as LSP
   ping and LSP traceroute.  [RFC8029] supports hierarchal and stitching
   LSPs.

   Unlike LDP or RSVP which are the other well-known MPLS control plane
   protocols, the basis of segment ID assignment in Segment Routing
   architecture is not hop-by-hop always.  Depending on the type of
   segment ID, the assignment can be unique to the node or within the
   domain.

   This nature of Segment Routing raises additional consideration for
   fault detection and isolation in Segment Routing network.  This
   document illustrates the problem and describe a mechanism to perform
   LSP Ping and Traceroute on Segment Routing network over MPLS data
   plane.

3.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminologies defined in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing], [RFC8029], and so the readers are
   expected to be familiar with the same.

4.  Challenges with Existing mechanism

   This document defines sub-TLVs for the Target Forwarding Equivalence
   Class (FEC) Stack TLV and explains how they can be used to tackle
   below challenges.

4.1.  Path validation in Segment Routing networks

   [RFC8029] defines the OAM machinery that helps with fault detection
   and isolation in MPLS data-plane path with the use of various Target
   FEC Stack Sub-TLV that are carried in MPLS Echo Request packets and
   used by the responder for FEC validation.  While it is obvious that
   new Sub-TLVs need to be assigned, the unique nature of Segment
   Routing architecture raises a need for additional machinery for path
   validation.  This section discusses the challenges as below:


                         L1
                     +--------+
                     |   L2   |
                     R3-------R6
                    /           \
                   /             \
           R1----R2               R7----R8
                   \             /
                    \           /
                     R4-------R5

             Figure 1: Segment Routing network

    The Node Segment IDs for R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7 and R8 are 5001,
    5002, 5003, 5004, 5005, 5006, 5007, 5008 respectively.

       9136 --> Adjacency Segment ID from R3 to R6 over link L1.
       9236 --> Adjacency Segment ID from R3 to R6 over link L2.
       9124 --> Adjacency segment ID from R2 to R4.
       9123 --> Adjacency Segment ID from R2 to R3.


   The forwarding semantic of Adjacency Segment ID is to pop the segment
   ID and send the packet to a specific neighbor over a specific link.
   A malfunctioning node may forward packets using Adjacency Segment ID



Kumar, et al.           Expires February 2, 2018                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft        LSP Ping/Trace for SR on MPLS          August 2017


   to incorrect neighbor or over incorrect link.  Exposed segment ID
   (after incorrectly forwarded Adjacency Segment ID) might still allow
   such packet to reach the intended destination, although the intended
   strict traversal has been broken.

   Assume in above topology, R1 sends traffic with segment stack as
   {9124, 5008} so that the path taken will be R1-R2-R4-R5-R7-R8.  If
   the Adjacency Segment ID 9124 is misprogrammed in R2 to send the
   packet to R1 or R3, it will still be delivered to R8 but is not via
   the expected path.

   MPLS traceroute may help with detecting such deviation in above
   mentioned scenario.  However, in a different example, it may not be
   helpful.  For example if R3, due to misprogramming, forwards packet
   with Adjacency Segment ID 9236 via link L1 while it is expected to be
   forwarded over Link L2.

4.2.  Service Label

   A Segment ID can represent a service based instruction.  A Segment
   Routing header can have label stack entries where the label
   represents a service to be applied along the path.  Since these
   labels are part of the label stack, they can influence the path taken
   by a packet and consequently have implications on MPLS OAM.  Service
   Label is left for future study.

5.  Segment ID sub-TLV

   The format of the following Segment ID sub-TLVs follows the
   philosophy of Target FEC Stack TLV carrying FECs corresponding to
   each label in the label stack.  When operated with the procedures
   defined in [RFC8029], this allows LSP ping/traceroute operations to
   function when Target FEC Stack TLV contains more FECs than received
   label stack at responder nodes.

   Three new sub-TLVs are defined for Target FEC Stack TLVs (Type 1),
   Reverse-Path Target FEC Stack TLV (Type 16) and Reply Path TLV (Type
   21).

           sub-Type    Value Field
           --------  ---------------
            34      IPv4 IGP-Prefix Segment ID
            35      IPv6 IGP-Prefix Segment ID
            36      IGP-Adjacency Segment ID


   Service Segments and FRR will be considered in future version.

6.  Extension to Downstream Detailed Mapping TLV

   In an echo reply, the Downstream Mapping TLV [RFC8029] is used to
   report for each interface over which a FEC could be forwarded.  For a
   FEC, there are multiple protocols that may be used to distribute
   label mapping.  The "Protocol" field of the Downstream Detailed
   Mapping TLV is used to return the protocol that is used to distribute
   a specific a label.  The following protocols are defined in
   Section 3.4.1.2 of [RFC8029]:

      Protocol #        Signaling Protocol
      ----------        ------------------
               0        Unknown
               1        Static
               2        BGP
               3        LDP
               4        RSVP-TE

   With segment routing, OSPF or ISIS can be used for label
   distribution, this document adds two new protocols as follows:

      Protocol #        Signaling Protocol
      ----------        ------------------
           5                  OSPF
           6                  ISIS

7.  Procedures

   This section describes aspects of LSP Ping and traceroute operations
   that require further considerations beyond [RFC8029].

7.1.  FECs in Target FEC Stack TLV

   When LSP echo request packets are generated by an initiator, FECs
   carried in Target FEC Stack TLV may need to have deviating contents.
   This document outlines expected Target FEC Stack TLV construction
   mechanics by initiator for known scenarios.

      Ping

         Initiator MUST include FEC(s) corresponding to the destination
         segment.

         Initiator MAY include FECs corresponding to some or all of
         segments imposed in the label stack by the initiator to
         communicate the segments traversed.

      Traceroute

         Initiator MUST initially include FECs corresponding to all of
         segments imposed in the label stack.

         When a received echo reply contains FEC Stack Change TLV with
         one or more of original segment(s) being popped, initiator MAY
         remove corresponding FEC(s) from Target FEC Stack TLV in the
         next (TTL+1) traceroute request as defined in Section 4.6 of
         [RFC8029].

         When a received echo reply does not contain FEC Stack Change
         TLV, initiator MUST NOT attempt to remove FEC(s) from Target
         FEC Stack TLV in the next (TTL+1) traceroute request.

7.2.  FEC Stack Change sub-TLV

   Section 3.4.1.3 of [RFC8029] defines FEC Stack Change sub-TLV that a
   router must include when the FEC stack changes.

   The network node which advertised the Node Segment ID is responsible
   for generating FEC Stack Change sub-TLV of pop operation for Node
   Segment ID, regardless of if PHP is enabled or not.

   The network node that is immediate downstream of the node which
   advertised the Adjacency Segment ID is responsible for generating FEC
   Stack Change sub-TLV of &pop& operation for Adjacency Segment ID.

Internet-Draft        LSP Ping/Trace for SR on MPLS          August 2017


7.3.  Segment ID POP Operation

   The forwarding semantic of Node Segment ID with PHP flag is
   equivalent to usage of implicit Null in MPLS protocols.  Adjacency
   Segment ID is also similar in a sense that it can be thought as next
   hop destined locally allocated segment that has PHP enabled.
   Procedures described in Section 4.4 of [RFC8029] relies on Stack-D
   and Stack-R explicitly having Implicit Null value.  It may simplify
   implementations to reuse Implicit Null for Node Segment ID PHP and
   Adjacency Segment ID cases.

7.4.  Segment ID Check

   This section updates the procedure defined in Step 6 of Section 4.4.
   of [RFC8029]

      If the Label-stack-depth is 0 and Target FEC Stack Sub-TLV at FEC-
      stack-depth is 34 (IPv4 IGP-Prefix Segment ID), the responder
      should set Best return code to 10, "Mapping for this FEC is not
      the given label at stack-depth <RSC>" if any below conditions
      fail:

      /* The responder LSR is to check if it is the egress of the IPv4
      IGP-Prefix Segment ID described in the Target FEC Stack Sub-TLV,
      and if the FEC was advertised with the PHP bit set.*/



      *  Validate that Node Segment ID is advertised for IPv4 Prefix by
         IGP Protocol{

         +  When protocol field in received IPv4 IGP-Prefix Segment ID
            Sub-TLV is 0, Use any locally enabled IGP protocol.

         +  When protocol field in received IPv4 IGP-Prefix Segment ID
            Sub-TLV is 1, Use OSPF as IGP protocol.

            Sub-TLV is 2, Use ISIS as IGP protocol.

         }

      *  Validate that Node Segment ID is advertised with No-PHP flag {

         +  When Protocol is OSPF, NP-flag defined in Section 5 of
            [I-D.ietf-ospf-segment-routing-extensions] should be set to
            0.

      If the Label-stack-depth is more than 0 and Target FEC Stack Sub-
      TLV at FEC-stack-depth is 34 (IPv4 IGP-Prefix Segment ID), the
      responder is to set Best return code to 10 if any below conditions

      If the Label-stack-depth is 0 and Target FEC Sub-TLV at FEC-stack-
      depth is 35 (IPv6 IGP-Prefix Segment ID), set Best return code to

            }

7.5.  TTL Consideration for traceroute

   LSP Traceroute operation can properly traverse every hop of Segment
   Routing network in Uniform Model described in [RFC3443].  If one or
   more LSRs employ Short Pipe Model described in [RFC3443], then LSP
   Traceroute may not be able to properly traverse every hop of Segment
   Routing network due to absence of TTL copy operation when outer label
   is popped.  Short Pipe being the most commonly used model.  The
   following TTL manipulation technique MAY be used when Short Pipe
   model is used.

   When tracing a LSP according to the procedures in [RFC8029] the TTL
   is incremented by one in order to trace the path sequentially along
   the LSP.  However when a source routed LSP has to be traced there are
   as many TTLs as there are labels in the stack.  The LSR that
   initiates the traceroute SHOULD start by setting the TTL to 1 for the
   tunnel in the LSP's label stack it wants to start the tracing from,
   the TTL of all outer labels in the stack to the max value, and the
   TTL of all the inner labels in the stack to zero.  Thus a typical
   start to the traceroute would have a TTL of 1 for the outermost label
   and all the inner labels would have TTL 0.  If the FEC Stack TLV is
   included it should contain only those for the inner stacked tunnels.
   The Return Code/Subcode and FEC Stack Change TLV should be used to
   diagnose the tunnel as described in [RFC8029].  When the tracing of a
   tunnel in the stack is complete, then the next tunnel in the stack
   should be traced.  The end of a tunnel can be detected from the

Internet-Draft        LSP Ping/Trace for SR on MPLS          August 2017


   "Return Code" when it indicates that the responding LSR is an egress
   for the stack at depth 1.  Thus the traceroute procedures in
   [RFC8029] can be recursively applied to traceroute a source routed
   LSP.

8.  Issues with non-forwarding labels

   Source stacking can be optionally used to apply services on the
   packet at a LSR along the path, where a label in the stack is used to
   trigger service application.  A data plane failure detection and
   isolation mechanism should provide its functionality without applying
   these services.  This is mandatory for services that are stateful,
   though for stateless services [RFC8029] could be used as-is.  It MAY
   also provide a mechanism to detect and isolate faults within the
   service function itself.

   How a node treats Service label is outside the scope of this document
   and will be included in this or a different document later.

9.  Backward Compatibility with non Segment Routing devices

   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-ldp-interop] describes how Segment
   Routing operates in network where SR-capable and non-SR-capable nodes
   coexist.  In such networks, there may not be any FEC mapping in the
   responder when the Initiator is SR-capable while the responder is not
   (or vice-versa).  But this is not different from RSVP and LDP interop
   scenarios.  When LSP Ping is triggered, the responder will set the
   FEC-return-code to Return 4, "Replying router has no mapping for the
   FEC at stack-depth".

   Similarly when SR-capable node assigns Adj-SID for non-SR-capable
   node, LSP traceroute may fail as the non-SR-capable node is not aware
   of "IGP Adjacency Segment ID" sub-TLV and may not reply with FEC
   Stack change.  This may result in any further downstream nodes to
   reply back with Return-code as 4, "Replying router has no mapping for
   the FEC at stack-depth".

10.  IANA Considerations

10.1.  New Target FEC Stack Sub-TLVs

   IANA is requested to assign three new Sub-TLVs from "Sub-TLVs for TLV
