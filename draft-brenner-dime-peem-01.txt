Abstract

   This document describes the need for a new IANA Diameter Command Code
   to be used in a vendor-specific new application for invocation of
   Policy Processing (Policy Evaluation, or Evaluation and Enforcement).
   This application is needed as one of the implementations of the Open
   Mobile Aliance (OMA) Policy Evaluation, Enforcement and Management
   (PEEM) enabler, namely for the PEM-1 interface used to send a
   request/responses for Policy Processing.

1.  Introduction

   This document summarizes the use of Diameter codes in a newly defined
   realization of a specification for invocation of policy processing
   (PEM-1).  A new Command Code is requested to be assigned by IANA.
   The document summarizes the uses of newly defined Diameter codes
   (Command Codes, AVP, vendor-specific application id).  When combined
   with the Diameter Base protocol, this application's specification
   satisfies the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) Policy Evaluation,
   Enforcement and Management (PEEM) requirements for sending a request
   for policy processing and receiving a response with the policy
   processing result.  See [PEM-1-TS] for the normative use of Diameter.
   PEEM requirements are documented in [PEEM-RD] and PEEM Architecture
   is documented in [PEEM-AD].

   The Diameter realization of this application assumes the use of
   Diameter Base protocol, as per RFC 3588, and extends it only for a
   specific application using a vendor-id (PEN), a vendor-specific
   application ID, a new Command Code (TBD), and new AVP defined in the
   vendor-specific namespace.  Input to policy processing are being
   passed through a new AVP, and policy results are being passed through
   a combination of the same new AVP, and the Experimental-Result AVP.


2.  Terminology

   The base Diameter specification [RFC3588] Section 1.4 defines most of
   the terminology used in this document.  Additionally, the terms and
   acronyms defined in [PEM-1-TS] are used in this document.



3.  Diameter Policy Processing Application

   A detailed description of the Diameter Policy Processing Application
   can be found in Section 5.4.1 of the Policy Evaluation, Enforcement
   and Management Callable Interface (PEM-1) Technical Specification
   [PEM-1-TS].


4.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the Diameter Policy Processing Application.
   It builds on top of the Diameter Base protocol and the same security
   considerations described in RFC 3588 [RFC3588] are applicable to this
   document.  No further extensions are required beyond the security
   mechanisms offered by RFC 3588.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This section provides guidance to the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA) regarding registration of values related to the
   Diameter protocol, in accordance with BCP 26 [RFC2434].

   This document defines values in the namespaces that have been created
   and defined in the Diameter Base [RFC3588].  The IANA Considerations
   section of that document details the assignment criteria.  Values
   assigned in this document, or by future IANA action, must be
   coordinated within this shared namespace.

5.1.  Command Codes

   This specification assigns the value TBD-Cmd-code from the Command
   Code namespace defined in [RFC3588].  See Section 5.4.1.3.1 of
   [PEM-1-TS] for the assignment of the TBD-Cmd-code.

5.2.  AVP Codes

   This specification assigns the value TBD-AVP-Code for the Policy-Data
   AVP, in the OMA Vendor-ID (PEN) AVP namespace.  See Section 5.4.1.3.3
   of [PEM-1-TS] for the assignment of the namespace in this
   specification.

5.3.  Application Identifier

   This specification uses the value 16777243 in the Application
   Identifier namespace as registered in IANA for the Policy Processing
   Application.  See Section 5.4.1.3 of [PEM-1-TS] for more information.
