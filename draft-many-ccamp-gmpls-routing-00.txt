5. GMPLS TE Links

   Traditionally, a TE link is advertised as an adjunct to a "regular"
   link, i.e., a routing adjacency is brought up on the link, and when
   the link is up, both the regular SPF properties of the link
   (basically, the SPF metric) and the TE properties of the link are
   then advertised.

   GMPLS challenges this notion in three ways.  First, links that are
   not capable of sending and receiving on a packet-by-packet basis may
   yet have TE properties; however, a routing adjacency cannot be
   brought up on such links.  Second, a Label Switched Path can be
   advertised as a point-to-point TE link (see [LSP-HIER]); thus, an
   advertised TE link may be between a pair of nodes that don't have a
   routing adjacency with each other.  Finally, a number of links may be
   advertised as a single TE link (perhaps for improved scalability), so
   again, there is no longer a one-to-one association of a regular
   routing adjacency and a TE link.

   Thus we have a more general notion of a TE link.  A TE link is a
   "logical" link that has TE properties. The link is logical in a sense
   that it represents a way to map the information about certain
   physical resources (and their properties) into the information that
   is used by Constrained SPF for the purpose of path computation.  Some
   of the properties of a TE link may be configured on the advertising
   Label Switching Router (LSR), others which may be obtained from other
   LSRs by means of some protocol, and yet others which may be deduced
   from the component(s) of the TE link.

   A TE link between a pair of LSRs doesn't imply the existence of a
   routing adjacency between these LSRs.

   A TE link must have some means by which the advertising LSR can know
   of its liveness (this means may be routing hellos, but is not limited
   to routing hellos). When an LSR knows that a TE link is up, and can
   determine the TE link's TE properties, the LSR may then advertise
   that link to its (regular) neighbors.

   In this document, we call the interfaces over which regular routing
   adjacencies are established "control channels".

   [ISIS-TE] and [OSFP-TE] defines the canonical TE properties, and says
   how to associate TE properties to regular (packet-switched) links.
   This document extends the set of TE properties, and also says how to
   associate TE properties with non-packet-switched links such as links
   between Optical Cross-Connects (OXCs).  [LSP-HIER] says how to
   associate TE properties with links formed by Label Switched Paths;
   [LINK-BUNLDE] says how to associate TE properties with a "bundle" of

   links.


5.1. Excluding data traffic from control channels

   The control channels between nodes in a GMPLS network, such as OXCs,
   SONET cross-connects and/or routers, are generally meant for control
   and administrative traffic.  These control channels are advertised
   into routing as normal links as mentioned in the previous section;
   this allows the routing of (for example) RSVP messages and telnet
   sessions.  However, if routers on the edge of the optical domain
   attempt to forward data traffic over these channels, the channel
   capacity will quickly be exhausted.

   In order to keep these control channels from being advertised into
   the user data plane a variety of techniques can be used.

   If one assumes that data traffic is sent to BGP destinations, and
   control traffic to IGP destinations, then one can exclude data
   traffic from the control plane by restricting BGP nexthop resolution.
   (It is assumed that OXCs are not BGP speakers.)  Suppose that a
   router R is attempting to install a route to a BGP destination D.  R
   looks up the BGP nexthop for D in its IGP's routing table.  Say R
   finds that the path to the nexthop is over interface I.  R then
   checks if it has an entry in its Link State database associated with
   the interface I.  If it does, and the link is not packet-switch
   capable (see [LSP_HIER]), R installs a discard route for destination
   D.  Otherwise, R installs (as usual) a route for destination D with
   nexthop I.  Note that R need only do this check if it has packet-
   switch incapable links; if all of its links are packet-switch
   capable, then clearly this check is redundant.

   In other instances it may be desirable to keep the whole address
   space of a GMPLS routing plane disjoint from the endpoint addresses
   in another portion of the GMPLS network. For example, the addresses
   of a carrier network where the carrier uses GMPLS but does not wish
   to expose the internals of the addressing or topology. In such a
   network the control channels are never advertised into the end data
   network. In this instance, independent mechanisms are used to
   advertise the data addresses over the carrier network. The Optical
   VPNs architecture [OVPN] discusses a mechanism for automating the
   distribution of independent addresses.

   Other techniques for excluding data traffic from control channels may
   also be needed.

6. GMPLS Routing Enhancements

   In this section we define the enhancements to the TE properties of
   GMPLS TE links. Encoding of this information in IS-IS is specified in
   [ISIS-GMPLS]. Encoding of this information in OSPF is specified in
   [OSPF-GMPLS].


6.1. Support for unnumbered interfaces

   Supporting unnumbered interfaces includes carrying the information
   about the identity of the interfaces.


6.1.1. Outgoing Interface Identifier

   A link from LSR A to LSR B may be assigned an "outgoing interface
   identifier". This identifier is a non-zero 32-bit number that is
   assigned by LSR A. This identifier must be unique within the scope of
   A.


6.1.2. Incoming Interface Identifier

   Suppose there is a link L from A to B.  Suppose further that the link
   L' from B to A that corresponds to the same interface as L has been
   assigned an outgoing interface identifier by B.  The "incoming
   interface identifier" for L (from A's point of view) is defined as
   the outgoing interface identifier for L' (from B's point of view).

   If no such L' exists (e.g., the interface is unidirectional), A MUST
   NOT advertise an Incoming Interface Identifier.  If A knows that such
   an L' exists, but does not know the outgoing interface identifier
   assigned to L' by B, A MAY include the Incoming Interface Identifier
   with a value of 0.


6.2. Link Protection Type

   The Link Protection Type represents the protection capability that
   exists for a link.  It is desirable to carry this information so that
   it may be used by the path computation algorithm to set up LSPs with
   appropriate protection characteristics. This information is organized
   in a hierarchy where typically the minimum acceptable protection is
   specified at path instantiation and a path selection technique is
   used to find a path that satisfies at least the minimum acceptable
   protection. Protection schemes are presented in order from lowest to
   highest protection.



draft-many-ccamp-gmpls-routing-00.txt                           [Page 5]





Internet Draft    draft-many-ccamp-gmpls-routing-00.txt        June 2001


   This document defines the following protection capabilities:

   Extra Traffic
      If the link is of type Extra Traffic, it means that the link is
      protecting another link or links.  The LSPs on a link of this type
      will be lost if any of the links it is protecting fail.

   Unprotected
      If the link is of type Unprotected, it means that there is no
      other link protecting this link.  The LSPs on a link of this type
      will be lost if the link fails.

   Shared
      If the link is of type Shared, it means that there are one or more
      disjoint links of type Extra Traffic that are protecting this
      link.  These Extra Traffic links are shared between one or more
      links of type Shared.

   Dedicated 1:1
      If the link is of type Dedicated 1:1, it means that there is one
      dedicated disjoint link of type Extra Traffic that is protecting
      this link.

   Dedicated 1+1
      If the link is of type Dedicated 1+1, it means that a dedicated
      disjoint link is protecting this link.  However, the protecting
      link is not advertised in the link state database and is therefore
      not available for the routing of LSPs.

   Enhanced
      If the link is of type Enhanced, it means that a protection scheme
      that is more reliable than Dedicated 1+1, e.g., 4 fiber BLSR/MS-
      SPRING, is being used to protect this link.

   The Link Protection Type is optional, and if an LSA doesn't carry
   this information, then the Link Protection Type is unknown.


6.3. Shared Risk Link Group Information

   A set of links may constitute a 'shared risk link group' (SRLG) if
   they share a resource whose failure may affect all links in the set.
   For example, two fibers in the same conduit would be in the same
   SRLG.  A link may belong to multiple SRLGs.  Thus the SRLG
   Information describes a list of SRLGs that the link belongs to.  An
   SRLG is identified by a 32 bit number that is unique within an IGP
   domain.  The SRLG Information is an unordered list of SRLGs that the
   link belongs to.



draft-many-ccamp-gmpls-routing-00.txt                           [Page 6]





Internet Draft    draft-many-ccamp-gmpls-routing-00.txt        June 2001


   The SRLG of a LSP is the union of the SRLGs of the links in the LSP.
   The SRLG of a bundled link is the union of the SRLGs of all the
   component links.

   If an LSR is required to have multiple diversely routed LSPs to
   another LSR, the path computation should attempt to route the paths
   so that they do not have any links in common, and such that the path
   SRLGs are disjoint.

   The SRLG Information starts with a configured value and does not
   change over time, unless manually reconfigured.  The SRLG Information
   is optional and if an LSA doesn't carry the SRLG Information, then it
   means that SRLG of that link is unknown.


6.4. Interface Switching Capability Descriptor

   In the context of this document we say that a link is connected to a
   node by an interface. In the context of GMPLS interfaces may have
   different switching capabilities.  For example an interface that
   connects a given link to a node may not be able to switch individual
   packets, but it may be able to switch channels within a SONET
   payload. Interfaces at each end of a link need not have the same
   switching capabilities.  Interfaces on the same node need not have
   the same switching capabilities.

   The Interface Switching Capability Descriptor describes switching
   capability of an interface. The switching capabilities of an
   interface are defined to be the same in either direction.  I.e., for
   data entering the node through that interface and for data leaving
   the node through that interface.

   For a bidirectional link, each LSA carries just the Interface
   Switching Capability Descriptor of the interface that connects the
   link to the LSR that originates the LSA.  For a unidirectional link
   each LSA should carry the Interface Switching Capability Descriptor
   for interfaces at both end of the link.

   This document defines the following Interface Switching Capabilities:

              Packet-Switch Capable-1 (PSC-1)
              Packet-Switch Capable-2 (PSC-2)
              Packet-Switch Capable-3 (PSC-3)
              Packet-Switch Capable-4 (PSC-4)
              Layer-2 Switch Capable  (L2SC)
              Time-Division-Multiplex Capable (TDM)
              Lambda-Switch Capable   (LSC)
              Fiber-Switch Capable    (FSC)

Internet Draft    draft-many-ccamp-gmpls-routing-00.txt        June 2001


   If there is no Interface Switching Capability Descriptor for an
   interface, the interface is assumed to be packet-switch capable
   (PSC-1).

   Interface Switching Capability Descriptors present a new constraint
   for LSP path computation.

   Irrespective of a particular Interface Switching Capability, the
   Interface Switching Capability Descriptor always includes information
   about the encoding supported by an interface. The defined encodings
   are the same as LSP Encoding as defined in [GMPLS-SIG].

   Depending on a particular Interface Switching Capability, the
   Interface Switching Capability Descriptor may include additional
   information, as specified below.


6.4.1. Layer-2 Switch Capable

   If an interface is of type L2SC, it means that the node receiving
   data over this interface can switch the received frames based on the
   layer 2 address.  For example, an interface associated with a link
   terminating on an ATM switch would be considered L2SC.


6.4.2. Packet-Switch Capable

   If an interface is of type PSC-1 through PSC-4, it means that the
   node receiving data over this interface can switch the received data
   on a packet-by-packet basis.  The various levels of PSC establish a
   hierarchy of LSPs tunneled within LSPs.

   For Packet-Switch Capable interfaces the additional information
   includes Maximum LSP Bandwidth.

   For a simple (unbundled) link its Maximum LSP Bandwidth at priority p
   is defined to be the smaller of its unreserved bandwidth at priority
   p and its Maximum Reservable Bandwidth.

   The Maximum LSP Bandwidth of a bundled link at priority p is defined
   to be the maximum of the Maximum LSP Bandwidth at priority p of each
   component link.

   The Maximum LSP Bandwidth takes the place of the Maximum Bandwidth
   ([ISIS-TE], [OSPF-TE]). However, while Maximum Bandwidth is a single
   fixed value (usually simply the link capacity), Maximum LSP Bandwidth
   is carried per priority, and may vary as LSPs are set up and torn
   down.



draft-many-ccamp-gmpls-routing-00.txt                           [Page 8]





Internet Draft    draft-many-ccamp-gmpls-routing-00.txt        June 2001


   Although Maximum Bandwidth is to be deprecated, for backward
   compatibility, one MAY set the Maximum Bandwidth to the Maximum LSP
   Bandwidth at priority 7.


6.4.3. Time-Division Multiplex Capable

   If an interface is of type TDM, it means that the node receiving data
   over this interface can multiplex or demultiplex channels within a
   SONET/SDH payload.

   For Time-Division Multiplex Capable interfaces the additional
   information includes Maximum LSP Bandwidth, the information on
   whether the interface supports Standard or Arbitrary SONET/SDH, and
   Minimum LSP Bandwidth.

   For a simple (unbundled) link the Maximum LSP Bandwidth at priority p
   is defined as the maximum bandwidth an LSP at priority p could
   reserve.

   The Maximum LSP Bandwidth of a bundled link at priority p is defined
   to be the maximum of the Maximum LSP Bandwidth at priority p of each
   component link.

   The Minimum LSP Bandwidth specifies the minimum bandwith an LSP could
   reserve.

   Typical values for the Minimum LSP Bandwidth and for the Maximum LSP
   Bandwidth are enumerated in [GMPLS-SIG].

   On an interface having Standard SONET (or Standard SDH) multiplexing,
   an LSP at priority p could reserve any bandwidth allowed by the
   branch of the SONET/SDH hierarchy, with the leaf and the root of the
   branch being defined by the Minimum LSP Bandwidth and the Maximum LSP
   Bandwidth at priority p.

   On an interface having Arbitrary SONET (or Arbitrary SDH)
   multiplexing, an LSP at priority p could reserve any bandwidth
   between the Minimum LSP Bandwidth and the Maximum LSP Bandwidth at
   priority p, provided that the bandwidth reserved by the LSP is a
   multiple of the Minimum LSP Bandwidth.

   To handle the case where an interface supports multiple branches of
   the SONET (or SDH) multiplexing hierarchy, multiple Interface
   Switching Capability Descriptors would be advertised, one per branch.
   For example, if an interface supports VT-1.5 and VT-2 (which are not
   part of same branch of SONET multiplexing tree), then it could
   advertise two descriptors, one for each one.

Internet Draft    draft-many-ccamp-gmpls-routing-00.txt        June 2001


6.4.4. Lambda-Switch Capable

   If an interface is of type LSC, it means that the node receiving data
   over this interface can recognize and switch individual lambdas
   within the interface. An interface that allows only one lambda per
   interface, and switches just that lambda is of type LSC.

   The additional information includes Reservable Bandwidth and
   priority, which specifies the bandwidth of an LSP that could be
   supported by the interface, and the (numerically) largest priority
   number at which the bandwidth could be reserved. Note that the
   priority needs to be present only when an interface has more than one
   Interface Switching Capability Descriptor with LSC as the Interface
   Switching Capability.

   To handle the case of multiple data rates or multiple encodings
   within a single TE Link, multiple Interface Switching Capability
   Descriptors would be advertised, one per supported data rate and
   encoding combination.  For example, an LSC interface could support
   the establishment of LSC LSPs at both OC-48c and OC-192c data rates.


6.4.5. Fiber-Switch Capable

   If an interface is of type FSC, it means that the node receiving data
   over this interface can switch the entire contents to another
   interface (without distinguishing lambdas, channels or packets).
   I.e., an interface of type FSC switches at the granularity of an
   entire interface, and can not extract individual lambdas within the
   interface. An interface of type FSC can not restrict itself to just
   one lambda.


6.4.6. Multiple Switching Capabilities per interface

   An interface that connects a link to an LSR may support not one, but
   several Interface Switching Capabilities. For example, consider a
   fiber link carrying a set of lambdas that terminates on an LSR
   interface that could either cross-connect one of these lambdas to
   some other outgoing optical channel, or could terminate the lamdba,
   and extract (demultiplex) data from that lambda using TDM, and then
   cross-connect these TDM channels to some outgoing TDM channels. To
   support this an LSA may carry a list of Interface Switching
   Capabilities Descriptors.

   If multiple links with such interfaces were to be advertised as one
   TE link, link bundling techniques should be used.

   SONET

   Consider a branch of SONET multiplexing tree : VT-1.5, STS-1, STS-3c,
   STS-12c, STS-48c, STS-192c. If it is possible to establish all these
   connections on a OC-192 interface, the Interface Multiplexing
   Capability Descriptor of that interface can be advertised as follows:

             Reservable Bandwidth = Determined by DWDM (say OC192)

   If multiple links with such interfaces were to be advertised as one
   TE link, one way to do this is to use link bundling. Another way to
   advertise multiple links with such interfaces as one TE link is just
   to require that all ports on the PXCs have identifiers unique to the
   PXC (as each interface identifier would act as a label).

6.4.7.6. Interface on an opaque OXC (SONET framed)

   An "opaque OXC" is considered operationally an OXC, as the whole
   lambda (carrying the SONET line) is switched transparently, that is
   either none of the SONET overhead bytes are changed or at least the
   important ones are not changed.

   An interface  on an opaque OXC handles a single wavelength on the
   fiber. It fits the definition of LSC and not FSC as it cannot switch
   an interface  with multiple wavelengths as a whole. Thus, an
   interface on an opaque OXC is always LSC, irrespective of whether
   there is DWDM external to it.  Note, if there is external DWDM then
   the framing understood by the DWDM must be same as that understood by
   the OXC.

   The following is an example of a interface switching capability
   decriptor on a SONET framed opaque OXC:

          Interface Switching Capability Descriptor:
             Interface Switching Capability = LSC
             Encoding = SONET ANSI T1.105-1995
             Reservable Bandwidth = Determined by SONET Framer (say OC192)

   If multiple links with such interfaces were to be advertised as one
   TE link, one way to do this is to use link bundling. Another way to
   advertise multiple links with such interfaces as one TE link is just
   to require that all interfaces on the OXCs have identifiers unique to
   the OXC (as each interface identifier would act as a label).


6.4.7.7. Interface on a PXC with no external DWDM

   The absence of DWDM in between two PXCs, implies that an interface is
   not limited to one wavelength. Thus, the interface is advertised as
   FSC.

          Interface Switching Capability Descriptor
             Interface Switching Capability = FSC
             Encoding = Photonic
             Reservable Bandwidth = Determined by optical technology limits

   Note that this example assumes that the PXC does not restrict each
   port to carry only one wavelength.

6.4.8. Example of interfaces that support multiple switching
   capabilities

   There can be many combinations possible, some are described below.


6.4.8.1. Interface on a PXC+TDM device with external DWDM

   As discussed earlier, the presence of the external DWDM limits that
   only one wavelength be on a port of the PXC. On such a port, the
   attached PXC+TDM device can do one of the following. The wavelength
   may be cross-connected by the PXC element to other out-bound optical
   channel, or the wavelength may be terminated as a SONET interface and
   SONET channels switched.

   From a GMPLS perspective DWDM and the PXC+TDM functionality is
   treated as a single unit. The interface is described using two
   Interface descriptors, one for the LSC and another for the TDM, with
   appropriate parameters. For example,

          Interface Switching Capability Descriptor:
             Interface Switching Capability = LSC
             Encoding = SONET ANSI T1.105-1995 (comes from WDM)
             Reservable Bandwidth = OC192

             and

          Interface Switching Capability Descriptor:
             Interface Switching Capability = TDM [Standard SONET]
             Encoding = SONET ANSI T1.105-1995
             Min LSP Bandwidth = VT1.5
             Max LSP Bandwidth[p] = STS192, for all p


6.4.8.2. Interface on an opaque OXC+LSR device with external DWDM

   An interface on an "opaque OXC+TDM" device would also be advertised
   as LSC+TDM much the same way as the previous case.


6.4.8.3. Interface on a PXC+LSR device with external DWDM

   As discussed earlier, the presence of the external DWDM limits that
   only one wavelength be on a port of the PXC. On such a port, the
   attached PXC+LSR device can do one of the following. The wavelength
   may be cross-connected by the PXC element to other out-bound optical
   channel, or the wavelength may be terminated as a Packet interface
   and packets switched.

   From a GMPLS perspective DWDM and the PXC+LSR functionality is
   treated as a single unit. The interface is described using two
   Interface descriptors, one for the LSC and another for the PSC, with
   appropriate parameters. For example,

          Interface Switching Capability Descriptor:
             Interface Switching Capability = LSC
             Encoding = SONET ANSI T1.105-1995 (comes from WDM)
             Reservable Bandwidth = OC192

            and

          Interface Switching Capability Descriptor:
             Interface Switching Capability = PSC-1
             Encoding = SONET ANSI T1.105-1995
             Max LSP Bandwidth[p] = 10 Gbps, for all p



6.4.8.4. Interface on a TDM+LSR device

   On a TDM+LSR device that offers a channelized SONET/SDH interface the
   following may be possible:

      - A subset of the SONET/SDH channels may be uncommitted. That is,
      they are not currently in use and hence are available for
      allocation.

      - A second subset of channels may already be committed for transit
      purposes. That is, they are already cross-connected by the
      SONET/SDH cross connect function to other out-bound channels and
      thus are not immediately available for allocation.

      - Another subset of channels could be in use as terminal channels.
      That is, they are already allocated by terminate on a packet
      interface and packets switched.

   The interface is advertised as TDM+PSC with example descriptors as:

          Interface Switching Capability Descriptor:
             Interface Switching Capability = TDM [Standard SONET]
             Encoding = SONET ANSI T1.105-1995
             Min LSP Bandwidth = VT1.5
             Max LSP Bandwidth[p] = STS192, for all p

            and

          Interface Switching Capability Descriptor:



draft-many-ccamp-gmpls-routing-00.txt                          [Page 15]





Internet Draft    draft-many-ccamp-gmpls-routing-00.txt        June 2001


             Interface Switching Capability = PSC-1
             Encoding = SONET ANSI T1.105-1995
             Max LSP Bandwidth[p] = 10 Gbps, for all p


6.4.9. Other issues

   It is possible that Interface Switching Capability Descriptor will
   change over time, reflecting the allocation/deallocation of LSPs.  In
   general, creation/deletion of an LSP on a link doesn't necessarily
   result in changing the Interface Switching Capability Descriptor of
   that interface.  For example, assume that STS-1, STS-3c, STS-12c,
   STS-48c and STS-192c LSPs can be established on a OC-192 interface
   whose Encoding Type is SONET (or to be more precise, SONET ANSI
   T1.105-1995).  Thus, initially in the Interface Multiplexing
   Capability Descriptor the Minimum LSP Bandwidth is set to STS-1, and
   Maximum LSP Bandwidth is set to STS-192 for all priorities.  As soon
   as an LSP of STS-1 size at priority 1 is established on the
   interface, it is no longer capable of STS-192c for all but LSPs at
   priority 0. Therefore, the node advertises a modified Interface
   Switching Capability Descriptor indicating that the Maximum LSP
   Bandwidth is no longer STS-192, but STS-48 for all but priority 0 (at
   priority 0 the Maximum LSP Bandwidth is still STS-192). If
   subsequently there is another STS-1 LSP, there is no change in the
   Interface Switching Capability Descriptor.  The Descriptor remains
   the same until the node can no longer establish a STS-48c LSP over
   the interface (which means that at this point more than 144 time
   slots are taken by LSPs on the interface).  Once this happened, the
   Descriptor is modified again, and the modified Descriptor is
   advertised to other nodes.


7. Security Considerations

   The routing extensions proposed in this document do not raise any new
   security concerns.
