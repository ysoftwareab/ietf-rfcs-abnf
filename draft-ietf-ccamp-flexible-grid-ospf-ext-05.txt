1. Introduction 

   [G.694.1] defines the Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) 
   frequency grids for Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) 
   applications.  A frequency grid is a reference set of frequencies

   used to denote allowed nominal central frequencies that may be used 
   for defining applications.  The channel spacing is the frequency 
   spacing between two allowed nominal central frequencies. All of the 
   wavelengths on a fiber should use different central frequencies and 
   occupy a fixed bandwidth of frequency. 

   Fixed grid channel spacing is selected from 12.5 GHz, 25 GHz, 50 GHz, 
   100 GHz and integer multiples of 100 GHz.  But [G.694.1] also 
   defines "flexible grids", also known as "flexi-grid".  The terms 
   "frequency slot" (i.e., the frequency range allocated to a specific 
   channel and unavailable to other channels within a flexible grid) 
   and "slot width" (i.e., the full width of a frequency slot in a 
   flexible grid) are used to define a flexible grid. 

   [RFC7698] defines a framework and the associated control plane 
   requirements for the GMPLS based control of flexi-grid DWDM networks. 

   [RFC6163] provides a framework for GMPLS and Path Computation 
   Element (PCE) control of Wavelength Switched Optical Networks 
   (WSONs), and [RFC7688] defines the requirements and OSPF-TE 
   extensions in support of GMPLS control of a WSON. 

   [RFC7792] describes requirements and protocol extensions for 
   signaling to set up LSPs in networks that support the flexi-grid, 
   and this document complements [RFC7792] by describing the 
   requirement and extensions for OSPF-TE routing in a flexi-grid 
   network. 

   This draft compliments the efforts to provide extensions to Open 
   Short Path First (OSPF) Traffic-Engineering (TE) protocol so as to 
   support GMPLS control of flexi-grid networks. 

2. Terminology  

   For terminology related to flexi-grid, please consult [RFC7698] and 
   [G.694.1]. 

2.1. Conventions Used in this Document 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119]. 

3. Requirements for Flexi-grid Routing  

   The architecture for establishing LSPs in a Spectrum Switched 
   optical Network (SSON) is described in [RFC7698].  
 
 
Zhang et al             Expires February 2017                 [Page 3] 

draft-ietf-ccamp-flexible-grid-ospf-ext-05.txt              August 2016 
    

   A flexi-grid LSP occupies a specific frequency slot, i.e. a range of 
   frequencies.  The process of computing a route and the allocation of 
   a frequency slot is referred to as RSA (Routing and Spectrum 
   Assignment).  [RFC7698] describes three types of architectural 
   approaches to RSA: combined RSA; separated RSA; and distributed SA.  
   The first two approaches among them could be called "centralized SA" 
   because the spectrum (frequency slot) assignment is performed by a 
   single entity before the signaling procedure. 

   In the case of centralized SA, the assigned frequency slot is 
   specified in the RSVP-TE Path message during the signaling process.  
   In the case of distributed SA, only the requested slot width of the 
   flexi-grid LSP is specified in the Path message, allowing the 
   involved network elements to select the frequency slot to be used. 

   If the capability of switching or converting the whole optical 
   spectrum allocated to an optical spectrum LSP is not available at 
   nodes along the path of the LSP, the LSP is subject to the Optical 
   "Spectrum Continuity Constraint", as described in [RFC7698]. 

   The remainder of this section states the additional extensions on 
   the routing protocols in a flexi-grid network.  That is, the 
   additional information that must be collected and passed between 
   nodes in the network by the routing protocols in order to enable 
   correct path computation and signaling in support of LSPs within the 
   network.  

3.1. Available Frequency Ranges  

   In the case of flexi-grids, the central frequency steps from 193.1 
   THz with 6.25 GHz granularity. The calculation method of central 
   frequency and the frequency slot width of a frequency slot are 
   defined in [G.694.1], i.e., by using nominal central frequency n and 
   the slot width m. 

   On a DWDM link, the allocated or in-use frequency slots must not 
   overlap with each other.  However, the border frequencies of two 
   frequency slots may be the same frequency, i.e., the highest 
   frequency of a frequency slot may be the lowest frequency of the 
   next frequency slot.

                    Central F = 193.1THz    Central F = 193.1375 THz

                 Figure 1 - Two Frequency Slots on a Link 
    
   Figure 1 shows two adjacent frequency slots on a link.  The highest 
   frequency of frequency slot 1 denoted by n=2 is the lowest frequency 
   of slot 2.  In this example, it means that the frequency range from 
   n=-2 to n=10 is unavailable to other flexi-grid LSPs. Available 
   central frequencies are advertised for m=1, which means that for an 
   available central frequency n, the frequency slot from central 
   frequency n-1 to central frequency n+1 is available. 

   Hence, in order to clearly show which LSPs can be supported and what 
   frequency slots are unavailable, the available frequency ranges MUST 
   be advertised by the routing protocol for the flexi-grid DWDM links.  
   A set of non-overlapping available frequency ranges MUST be 
   disseminated in order to allow efficient resource management of 
   flexi-grid DWDM links and RSA procedures which are described in 
   Section 4.8 of [RFC7698]. 

3.2. Application Compliance Considerations 

   As described in [G.694.1], devices or applications that make use of 
   the flexi-grid may not be capable of supporting every possible slot 
   width or position (i.e., central frequency).  In other words, 
   applications or implementations may be defined where only a subset 
   of the possible slot widths and positions are required to be 
   supported. 

   For example, an application could be defined where the nominal 
   central frequency granularity is 12.5 GHz (by only requiring values 
   of n that are even) and that only requires slot widths as a multiple 
   of 25 GHz (by only requiring values of m that are even).  

   Hence, in order to support all possible applications and 
   implementations the following information should be advertised for a 
   flexi-grid DWDM link:

   o Channel Spacing (C.S.): as defined in [RFC7699] for flexi-grid, 
      is set to 5 to denote 6.25GHz. 

   o Central frequency granularity: a multiplier of C.S.. 

   o Slot width granularity: a multiplier of 2*C.S.. 

   o Slot width range: two multipliers of the slot width granularity, 
      each indicate the minimal and maximal slot width supported by a 
      port respectively.  

   The combination of slot width range and slot width granularity can 
   be used to determine the slot widths set supported by a port.  

3.3. Comparison with Fixed-grid DWDM Links  

   In the case of fixed-grid DWDM links, each wavelength has a pre-
   defined central frequency and each wavelength maps to a pre-defined 
   central frequency and the usable frequency range is implicit by the 
   channel spacing.  All the wavelengths on a DWDM link can be 
   identified with an identifier that mainly convey its central 
   frequency as the label defined in [RFC6205], and the status of the 
   wavelengths (available or not) can be advertised through a routing 
   protocol. 

   Figure 2 shows a link that supports a fixed-grid with 50 GHz channel 
   spacing.  The central frequencies of the wavelengths are pre-defined 
   by values of "n" and each wavelength occupies a fixed 50 GHz 
   frequency range as described in [G.694.1].  

    
        W(-2)  |    W(-1)  |    W(0)   |    W(1)   |     W(2)  | 
   ...---------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+----... 
         |   50 GHz  |  50 GHz   |  50 GHz   |   50 GHz  |  
    
       n=-2        n=-1        n=0         n=1         n=2               
   ...---+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+----------... 
                                 ^              
                    Central F = 193.1THz     
    
      Figure 2 - A Link Supports Fixed Wavelengths with 50 GHz Channel 
                                 Spacing 
    
   Unlike the fixed-grid DWDM links, on a flexi-grid DWDM link the slot 
   width of the frequency slot is flexible as described in section 3.1.  
   That is, the value of m in the following formula [G.694.1] is 

 
 
Zhang et al             Expires February 2017                 [Page 6] 

draft-ietf-ccamp-flexible-grid-ospf-ext-05.txt              August 2016 
    

   uncertain before a frequency slot is actually allocated for a flexi-
   grid LSP.   

                Slot Width (GHz) = 12.5GHz * m 

   For this reason, the available frequency slot/ranges need to be 
   advertised for a flexi-grid DWDM link instead of the specific 
   "wavelengths" points that are sufficient for a fixed-grid link.  
   Moreover, thus advertisement is represented by the combination of 
   Central Frequency Granularity and Slot Width Granularity.  

4. Extensions 

   As described in [RFC7698], the network connectivity topology 
   constructed by the links/nodes and node capabilities are the same as 
   for WSON, and can be advertised by the GMPLS routing protocols 
   (refer to section 6.2 of [RFC6163]).  In the flexi-grid case, the 
   available frequency ranges instead of the specific "wavelengths" are 
   advertised for the link.  This section defines the GMPLS OSPF-TE 
   extensions in support of advertising the available frequency ranges 
   for flexi-grid DWDM links.

   Switching Capability and Encoding values MUST be used as follows:

              Encoding Type = lambda [as defined in RFC3471] 

   When Switching Capability and Encoding fields are set to values as 
   stated above, the Interface Switching Capability Descriptor MUST be 
   interpreted as in [RFC4203] with the optional inclusion of one or 
   more Switching Capability Specific Information sub-TLVs.  

   As the "Max LSP Bandwidth at priority x" (x from 0 to 7) fields in 
   the generic part of the Interface Switching Capability Descriptor 
   [RFC4203] are not meaningful for flexi-grid DWDM links, the values 
   of these fields MUST be set to zero and MUST be ignored. The

   Switching Capability Specific Information (SCSI) as defined below 
   provides the corresponding information for flexi-grid DWDM links. 

4.1.1. Switching Capability Specific Information (SCSI)  

   The technology specific part of the Flexi-grid ISCD should include 
   the available frequency spectrum resource as well as the max slot 
   widths per priority information. The format of this flex-grid SCSI, 
   the frequency available bitmap TLV, is depicted in the following

   Type (16 bits): The type of this sub-TLV and is set to 1.   

   Length (16 bits): The length of the value field of this sub-TLV. 

   Priority (8 bits): A bitmap used to indicate which priorities     
   are being advertised.  The bitmap is in ascending order, with the      
   leftmost bit representing priority level 0 (i.e., the highest) and      
   the rightmost bit representing priority level 7 (i.e., the      
   lowest).  A bit MUST be set (1) corresponding to each priority      
   represented in the sub-TLV, and MUST NOT be set (0) when the      
   corresponding priority is not represented.  At least one priority      
   level MUST be advertised that, unless overridden by local policy,      
   SHALL be at priority level 0. 

   Max Slot Width (16 bits): This field indicates maximal frequency 
   slot width supported at a particular priority level.  This field 
   MUST be set to max frequency slot width supported in the unit of

   2*C.S., for a particular priority level.  One field MUST be present 
   for each bit set in the Priority field, and is ordered to match the 
   Priority field.  Fields MUST NOT be present for priority levels that 
   are not indicated in the Priority field. 

   Unreserved Padding (16 bits): The Padding field is used to      
   ensure the 32 bit alignment of Max Slot Width fields.  When      
   present the Unreserved Padding field is 16 bits (2 byte) long.      
   When the number of priorities is odd, the Unreserved Padding field      
   MUST be included.  When the number of priorities is even, the      
   Unreserved Padding MUST be omitted. 

   C.S. (4 bits): As defined in [RFC7699] and it is currently set to 5. 

   Starting n (16 bits): as defined in [RFC7699] and this value denotes 
   the starting nominal central frequency point of the frequency 
   availability bitmap sub-TLV. 

   Number of Effective Bits (12 bits): Indicates the number of 
   effective bits in the Bit Map field. 

   Bit Map (variable):  Indicates whether a basic frequency slot, 
   characterized by a nominal central frequency and a fixed m value of 
   1, is available or not for flexi-grid LSP setup. The first nominal 
   central frequency is the value of starting n and with the subsequent 
   ones implied by the position in the bitmap. Note that when setting 
   to 1, it means that the corresponding central frequency is available 
   for a flexi-grid LSP with m=1; and when setting to 0, it means the 
   corresponding central frequency is unavailable. Note that a 
   centralized SA process will need to extend this to high values of m 
   by checking a sufficient large number of consecutive basic frequency 
   slots that are available. 

   Padding Bits (variable): Padded after the Bit Map to make it a 
   multiple of four bytes if necessary.  Padding bits MUST be set to 0 
   and MUST be ignored on receipt. 

   The Reserved field MUST be set to zero on transmission and SHOULD be

   The starting n MAY be set to the lowest possible nominal central 
   frequency supported by the link. An example is provided in section

4.1.2. An SCSI Example 

   Figure 3 shows an example of the available frequency spectrum 
   resource of a flexi-grid DWDM link.

                  Figure 3 - Flexi-grid DWDM Link Example 
                                      
   The symbol "+" represents the allowed nominal central frequency. The 
   symbol "--" represents a central frequency granularity of 6.25 GHz, 
   as currently be standardized in [G.694.1].  The number on the top of 
   the line represents the "n" in the frequency calculation formula 
   (193.1 + n * 0.00625).  The nominal central frequency is 193.1 THz 
   when n equals zero.  

   In this example, it is assumed that the lowest nominal central 
   frequency supported is n= -9 and the highest is n=11. Note they 
   cannot be used as a nominal central frequency for setting up a LSP, 
   but merely as the way to express the supported frequency range. 
   Using the encoding defined in Section 4.1.1, the relevant fields to 
   express the frequency resource availability can be filled as below:  

     0                   1                   2                   3

   In the above example, the starting n is selected to be the lowest 
   nominal central frequency, i.e. -9. It is observed from the bit map 
   that n = -1 to 7 can be used to set up LSPs. Note other starting n 
   values can be chosen to represent the bit map, for example, the

   first available nominal central frequency (a.k.a., the first 
   available basic frequency slot) can be chosen and the SCSI will be 
   expressed as the following:  

    

     0                   1                   2                   3

   This denotes that other than the advertised available nominal 
   central frequencies, the other nominal central frequencies within 
   the whole frequency range supported by the link are not available 
   for flexi-grid LSP set up. 

   If a LSP with slot width (m) equal to 1 is set up using this link, 
   say using n= -1, then the SCSI information is updated to be the 
   following:  

     0                   1                   2                   3

4.2. Extensions to Port Label Restriction sub-TLV 

   As described in Section 3.2, a port that supports flexi-grid may 
   support only a restricted subset of the full flexible grid.  The 
   Port Label Restriction sub-TLV is defined in [RFC7579].  It can be 
   used to describe the label restrictions on a port and is carried in 
   the top-level Link TLV as specified in [RFC7580].  A new restriction 
   type, the flexi-grid Restriction Type, is defined here to specify 
   the restrictions on a port to support flexi-grid.

   MatrixID (8 bits): As defined in [RFC7579]. 

   RstType (Restriction Type, 8 bits): Takes the value of 5 to indicate 
   the restrictions on a port to support flexi-grid. 

   Switching Cap (Switching Capability, 8 bits): As defined in 
   [RFC7579], MUST be consistent with the one specified in ISCD as 
   described in Section 4.1.  

   Encoding (8 bits): As defined in [RFC7579], must be consistent with 
   the one specified in ISCD as described in Section 4.1. 

   C.S. (4 bits): As defined in [RFC7699] and for flexi-grid is 5 to 
   denote 6.25GHz. 

   C.F.G (Central Frequency Granularity, 8 bits): A positive integer.  
   Its value indicates the multiple of C.S., in terms of central 
   frequency granularity. 

   S.W.G (Slot Width Granularity, 8 bits): A positive integer.  Its 
   value indicates the multiple of 2*C.S., in terms of slot width 
   granularity.

6. Implementation Status 

   [RFC Editor Note: Please remove this entire section prior to 
   publication as an RFC.] 

   This section records the status of known implementations of the   
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of 
   this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC 
   6982[RFC6982].  The description of implementations in this section 
   is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in 
   progressing drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any 
   individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the 
   IETF. Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the 
   information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.  
   This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog 
   of available implementations or their features.  Readers are advised 
   to note that other implementations may exist. 

   According to RFC 6982, "this will allow reviewers and working groups 
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of 
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable 
   experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented 
   protocols more mature. It is up to the individual working groups to 
   use this information as they see fit. 

6.1. Centre Tecnologic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC)

8. Security Considerations 

   This document extends [RFC4203] and [RFC7580] to carry flex-grid 
   specific information in OSPF Opaque LSAs. This document does not 
   introduce any further security issues other than those discussed in 
   [RFC3630], [RFC4203]. To be more specific, the security mechanisms 
   described in [RFC2328] which apply to Opaque LSAs carried in OSPF 
   still apply. An analysis of the OSPF security is provided in 
   [RFC6863] and applies to the extensions to OSPF in this document as 
   well.
