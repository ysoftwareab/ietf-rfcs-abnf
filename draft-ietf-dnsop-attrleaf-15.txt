    DNS Scoped Data Through "Underscore" Naming of Attribute Leaves
                      draft-ietf-dnsop-attrleaf-15

Abstract

   Formally, any DNS resource record may occur under any domain name.
   However some services use an operational convention for defining
   specific interpretations of an RRset, by locating the records in a
   DNS branch, under the parent domain to which the RRset actually
   applies.  The top of this subordinate branch is defined by a naming
   convention that uses a reserved node name, which begins with an
   _underscore.  The underscored naming construct defines a semantic
   scope for DNS record types that are associated with the parent
   domain, above the underscored branch.  This specification explores
   the nature of this DNS usage and defines the "DNS Global Underscore
   Scoped Entry Registry" with IANA.  The purpose of the Underscore
   registry is to avoid collisions resulting from the use of the same
   underscore-based name, for different services.

1.  Introduction

   The core Domain Name System (DNS) technical specifications assign no
   semantics to domain names or their parts, and no constraints upon
   which resource record (RR) types are permitted to be stored under
   particular names [RFC1035], [RFC2181].  Over time, some leaf node
   names, such as "www" and "ftp" have come to imply support for
   particular services, but this is a matter of operational convention,
   rather than defined protocol semantics.  This freedom in the basic
   technology has permitted a wide range of administrative and semantic
   policies to be used -- in parallel.  DNS data semantics have been
   limited to the specification of particular resource record types, on
   the expectation that new resource record types would be added as
   needed.  Unfortunately, the addition of new resource record types has

   proven extremely challenging, over the life of the DNS, with
   significant adoption and use barriers.

1.1.  Underscore Scoping

   As an alternative to defining a new RR type, some DNS service
   enhancements call for using an existing resource record type, but
   specify a restricted scope for its occurrence.  Scope is meant as a
   static property, not one dependent on the nature of the query.  It is
   an artifact of the DNS name.  That scope is a leaf node, within which
   the uses of specific resource record sets can be formally defined and
   constrained.  The leaf occurs in a branch having a distinguished
   naming convention: At the top of the branch -- beneath the parent
   domain name to which the scope applies -- one or more reserved DNS
   node names begin with an underscore ("_").  Because the DNS rules for
   a "host" (host name) do not allow use of the underscore character,
   this distinguishes the underscored name from all legal host names
   [RFC952].  Effectively, this convention for leaf node naming creates
   a space for the listing of "attributes" -- in the form of resource
   record types -- that are associated with the parent domain, above the
   underscored sub-branch.

   The scoping feature is particularly useful when generalized resource
   record types are used -- notably "TXT", "SRV", and "URI" [RFC1035],
   [RFC2782], [RFC6335], [RFC7553].  It provides efficient separation of
   one use of them from others.  Absent this separation, an
   undifferentiated mass of these "RRsets" is returned to the DNS
   client, which then must parse through the internals of the records in
   the hope of finding ones that are relevant.  Worse, in some cases the
   results are ambiguous because a record type might not adequately
   self-identify its specific purpose.  With underscore-based scoping,
   only the relevant "RRsets"s are returned.

   A simple example is DKIM [RFC6376] , which uses "_domainkey" for
   defining a place to hold a "TXT" record containing signing
   information for the parent domain.

   This specification formally defines how underscored labels are used
   as "attribute" enhancements for their parent domain names.  For
   example, domain name "_domainkey.example." acts as an attribute of
   the parent domain name "example."  To avoid collisions resulting from
   the use of the same underscore-based labels for different
   applications using the same resource record type, this document
   establishes the DNS Underscore Global Scoped Entry IANA Registry.
   Use of such node names, which begin with underscore, are reserved
   when they are the underscored name closest to the DNS root; they are
   considered "global".  Underscore-based names that are farther down

   the hierarchy are handled within the scope of the global underscore
   name.

   Discussion Venue:    Discussion about this draft should be directed
      to the dnsop@ietf.org [1] mailing list.

   NOTE TO RFC EDITOR:    Please remove "Discussion Venue" paragraph
      prior to publication.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Scaling Benefits

   Some resource record types are used in a fashion that can create
   scaling problems, if an entire RRset associated with a domain name is
   aggregated in the leaf node for that name.  An increasingly-popular
   approach, with excellent scaling properties, places the RRset under a
   specially named branch, which is in turn under the node name that
   would otherwise contain the RRset.  The rules for naming that branch
   define the context for interpreting the RRset.  That is, rather than:

                            domain-name.example
                              /
                             RRset

   the arrangement is:

                        _branch.domain-name.example
                          /
                         RRset

   A direct lookup to the subordinate leaf node produces only the
   desired record types, at no greater cost than a typical DNS lookup.

1.3.  "Global" Underscored Node Names

   As defined in [RFC1034] the DNS uses names organized in a tree-
   structured, or hierarchical fashion.  A domain name might have
   multiple node names that begin with an _underscore.  A "global"
   underscored node name is the one that is closest to the root of the
   DNS hierarchy, also called the highest-level or top-most.  In the
   presentation convention described in Section 3.1 of [RFC1034] this is
   the right-most name beginning with an underscore.  In other
   presentation environments it might be positioned differently.  To

   avoid concern for the presentation variations, the qualifier "global"
   is used here.

1.4.  Interaction with DNS wildcards

   DNS wildcards interact poorly with underscored names in two ways.
   Since wildcards only are interpreted as leaf names, one cannot create
   the equivalent of a wildcard name for prefixed names.  A name such as
   label.*.example.com is not a wildcard.

   Conversely, a wildcard such as *.example.com can match any name
   including an underscored name.  So, a wildcard might match an
   underscored name, returning a record that is the type controlled by
   the underscored name but is not intended to be used in the
   underscored context and does not conform to its rules.

1.5.  History

   Originally different uses of underscore-based node names developed
   largely without coordination.  For "TXT" records, there is no
   consistent, internal syntax that to permits distinguishing among the
   different uses.  In the case of the "SRV" "RR" and "URI" "RR",
   distinguishing among different types of use was part of the design
   [RFC2782], [RFC7553].  The "SRV" and "URI" specifications serve as
   templates, defining "RR"s that might only be used for specific
   applications when there is an additional specification.  The template
   definition included reference to two levels of tables of names from
   which underscore-names should be drawn.  The lower-level (local
   scope) set of <"_service"> names is defined in terms of other IANA
   tables, namely any table with symbolic names.  The upper-level
   (global scope) "SRV" naming field is <"_proto">, although its pool of
   names is not explicitly defined.

   The aggregate effect of these independent efforts was a long list of
   underscore-based names that were reserved without coordination, which
   invites an eventual name-assignment collision.  The remedy is this
   base document, which defines a registry for these names, and attempts
   to register all those already in use, with a companion document
   [attrleaf-fix] developed to direct changes to the pre-registry
   specifications that used underscore-based (global) node names.

2.  DNS Underscore Scoped Entry Registries Function

   A registry for "global" DNS node names that begin with an underscore
   is defined here.  The purpose of the Underscore Global Registry is to
   avoid collisions resulting from the use of the same underscore-based
   name, for different applications.

   o  If a public specification calls for use of an underscore-prefixed
      domain node name, the "global" underscored name -- the underscored
      name that is closest to the DNS root -- MUST be entered into this
      registry.

   An underscored name defines the scope of use for specific resource
   record types, which are associated with the domain name that is the
   "parent" to the branch defined by the underscored name.  A given name
   defines a specific, constrained context for one or more RR types,
   where use of such record types conforms to the defined constraints.

   o  Within an underscore scoped leaf, other RRsets that are not
      specified as part of the scope MAY be used.

   Structurally, the registry is defined as a single, flat table of RR
   types, under node names beginning with underscore.  In some cases,
   such as for use of an "SRV" record, the full scoping name might be
   multi-part, as a sequence of underscored names.  Semantically, that
   sequence represents a hierarchical model and it is theoretically
   reasonable to allow re-use of a subordinate underscored name in a
   different, global underscored context; that is, a subordinate name is
   meaningful only within the scope of the global underscored name.
   Therefore they are ignored by this DNS Underscore Global Scoped Entry
   Registry.  This registry is for the definition of highest-level --
   ie, global -- underscored node name used.

                      +----------------------------+
                      |                       NAME |
                      +----------------------------+
                      |                  _service1 |
                      |          _protoB._service2 |
                      |          _protoB._service3 |
                      |          _protoC._service3 |
                      |    _useX._protoD._service4 |
                      | _protoE._region._authority |
                      +----------------------------+

                  Table 1: Examples of Underscored Names

   Only global underscored names are registered in the IANA Underscore
   Only the global underscored names "_service1", "_service2", Global
   table.  (From the example, that would mean registering "_service3",
   "_service4", and "_authority" are registered in the IANA _service1,
   _service2, _service3, _service 4, and _authority.)

   o  The use of underscored node names is specific to each RRTYPE that
      is being scoped.  Each name defines a place, but does not define
      the rules for what appears underneath that place, either as

      additional underscored naming or as a leaf node with resource
      records.  Details for those rules are provided by specifications
      for individual RRTYPEs.  The sections below describe the way that
      existing underscore labels are used with the RRTYPEs that they
      name.

   o  Definition and registration of subordinate, underscore node names
      is the responsibility of the specification that creates the global
      registry entry.

   That is, if a scheme using a global underscore node name has one or
   more subordinate levels of underscore node naming, the namespaces
   from which names for those lower levels are chosen are controlled by
   the parent underscore node name.  Each globally-registered underscore
   name owns a distinct, subordinate name space.

3.  RRset Use Registration Template

   This section provides a basic template that can be used to register
   new entries in the IANA DNS Underscore Global Scoped Entry Registry,
   if the global underscored name above the RRTYPE is not already
   registered.  The text can be added to specifications using
   RRTYPE/_Node-name combinations that have not already been registered.

      "Per {RFC Attrleaf} please add the following entry to the DNS
      Underscore Global Scoped Entry Registry:"

   Note to RFC Editor:   Please replace the above "{RFC Attrleaf}" text
      with a reference to this document's RFC number. /d

4.1.  DNS Underscore Global Scoped Entry Registry

   The DNS Global Underscore Scoped Entry Registry is any DNS node name
   that begin with the underscore character ("_", ASCII 0x5F) and is the
   underscored node name closest to the root; that is it defines the
   highest-level of a DNS branch, under a "parent" domain name.

   o  This registry is to operate under the IANA rules for "Expert
      Review" registration; see Section 5.

   o  The contents of each entry in the Global registry are defined in
      Section 4.2.

   o  Each entry in the registry MUST contain values for all of the
      fields specified in Section 4.2.

   o  Within the registry, the combination of RR Type and _Node Name
      MUST be unique.

   o  The table is to be maintained with entries sorted by the first
      column (RR Type) and, within that, the second column (_Node Name).

   o  The required Reference for an entry MUST have a stable resolution
      to the organization controlling that registry entry.

4.2.  DNS Underscore Global Scoped Entry Registry Definition

   A registry entry contains:



      RR Type:    Lists an RR type that is defined for use within this
                scope.

      _Node Name:    Specifies a single, underscored name that defines a
                reserved name; this name is the "global" entry name for
                the scoped resource record types that are associated
                with that name; for characters in the name that have an
                upper-case form and a lower-case form, the character
                MUST be recorded as lower-case, to simplify name
                comparisons.

      References:    Lists the specification that defines a record type
                and its use under this _Node Name.  The organization
                producing the specification retains control over the
                registry entry for the _Node Name.

   Each RR type that is to be used with a _Node Name MUST have a
   separate registry entry.

           Table 3: Underscore Global Registry (initial entries)

   NOTE:    Under the NULL RR, the entry ""_ta-*"" denotes all node
      names beginning with the string ""_ta-*"".  It does NOT refer to a
      DNS wildcard specification.

4.4.  Enumservices Registrations Registry

   Please add a note to the Enumservice Registrations registry with the
   following -- or similar -- language:

      "When adding an entry to this registry, strong consideration
      should be given to also adding an entry to the 'DNS Underscore
      Global Scoped Entry Registry'."

5.  Guidance for Expert Review

   This section provides guidance for expert review of registration
   requests in the DNS Underscore Global Scoped Entry Registry.

      This review is solely to determine adequacy of a requested entry
      in this Registry, and does not include review of other aspects of
      the document specifying that entry.  For example such a document
      might also contain a definition of the resource record type that
      is referenced by the requested entry.  Any required review of that
      definition is separate from the expert review required here.

   The review is for the purposes of ensuring that:

   o  The details for creating the registry entry are sufficiently
      clear, precise and complete

Internet-Draft                DNS AttrLeaf                 November 2018


   o  The combination of the underscored name, under which the listed
      resource record type is used, and the resource record type, is
      unique in the table

   For the purposes of this Expert Review, other matters of the
   specification's technical quality, adequacy or the like are outside
   of scope.

6.  Security Considerations

   This memo raises no security issues.
