1. Introduction

   This document contains a set of elliptic curves over prime fields
   with many security advantages.

2. The Curves

   Each curve is given by an equation and a basepoint, together with an
   order. All curves are elliptic. Validation information is given at
   [SAFECURVES]. The names given in this document indicate the family.

3. Security Considerations

   This entire document discusses methods of implementing cryptography
   securely. The time for an attacker to break the DLP on these curves
   is the square root of the group order with the best known attacks.

   Curves of Edwards form are best when addition is required, those of
   Montgomery form make excellent candidates for Diffie-Hellman key
   agrement on the Kummer surface. Explicit formulas are in the
   Explicit-Formula Database [EFD].

4. IANA Considerations

   IANA should maintain a registry of these curves, calling them
   safecurve-XXXX where XXX is the curve identifier.
