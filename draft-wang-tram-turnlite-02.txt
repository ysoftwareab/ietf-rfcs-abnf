     A Lightweight TURN Architecture and Specification (TURN-Lite)
                      draft-wang-tram-turnlite-02

Abstract

   This document proposes a new relay-based NAT traversal architecture
   called TURN-Lite which could simplify the data communication process
   between two hosts that locates behind some non-BEHAVE compliant
   [RFC4787] [RFC5382] NAT devices.  The key mechanism in TURN-Lite is
   the newly defined "Couple" operation (using STUN [RFC5389] message
   format) which allows the TURN-Lite servers to be easily incorporated
   into existing CGN devices/CDN nodes which are already deployed within
   the network in a distributed manner.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivations

   This document proposes a new relay-based NAT traversal architecture
   called TURN-Lite based on the following motivations.

   1) Leverage ISPs' infrastructures

   Currently, the deployment of TURN [RFC5766] is very limited and most
   of the application providers use their own platform to transfer the
   data between two hosts that behind NATs and to translate the

   communication packets between two hosts in different address
   families.

   The relay devices deployed centrally by various application providers
   often lead to inefficient data transmit between two hosts.  The relay
   devices must deal with complex network layer problems which the
   application providers are not familiar with.

   On the other hand, service providers have deployed many CGN devices/
   CDN nodes in a distributed manner within their networks.  If the
   service providers can use these CGN devices/CDN nodes as the relay
   devices for communication between two hosts behind NATs or that from
   different address family, and open their data translation/forwarding
   capability to the application providers, the host to host
   communication will be more efficient.  Given most of the CGNs are
   capable of translating packets between IPv4 and IPv6, the adoption of
   IPv6 technology will also be accelerated.

   2) Simplify the communication procedures

   TURN-Lite needs less communication procedures than TURN of which the
   procedures are considered very complex to be integrated into the
   ISPs' infrastructure, for example:

   o  TURN solution has to closely interact with ICE

         Within current TURN solution, there are scenarios where the ICE
         or other NAT-hole punching procedures must be included for the
         success of communication via TURN servers.  The key point is
         that TURN allocates different relay transport address-port
         pairs for different hosts.

         Each client must first use TURN allocation request to get their
         transport relay address-port pairs, and then must use ICE
         procedure (connectivity check) or other similar signaling to
         punch holes for these transport relay addresses on the
         alongside NAT devices.  Or else the relayed UDP/TCP packet will
         be blocked.

         Even with the above procedures, there still exists some risks
         that the packets be rejected by TURN server due to the
         permission list that created by client via "CreatePermission
         Request" before it sending data to the peer.  In order to
         mitigate such issues, current TURN solution requires the TURN
         servers only check the IP address part of the relay transport
         address, and ignore the port portion.  But this will again
         introduce some attack risks because different host may share

         one public IP address when the CGN device is deployed within
         network.

   o  IPv4/IPv6 Relay Address/Port Reservation and Allocation

         Another drawback of different relay transport addresses for
         different host is that the TURN server must reserve some IPv4/
         IPv6 address block for the allocation and plan the TCP/UDP port
         usage for each host.  When TURN servers are deployed in a
         distribute manner (For example when they are incorporated into
         the CGN devices), there will be much coordination work to do
         for the address/port reservation and allocation on the TURN
         servers.

   o  Simultaneous TCP/UDP connections burden on TURN server

         Current TURN solution requires the TURN servers to open and
         listen on many TCP/UDP ports at the same time, and the number
         of sessions is proportional to the number of the hosts under
         one relay server.(Under TURN solution for TCP [RFC6062], each
         host requires two connections to the TURN server).  This will
         increase the burden on TURN server and the complexity to
         incorporate them into the CGN/CDN devices.

   o  Different procedures for TCP/UDP communication

         Current TURN solution adopts different procedures for the TCP
         and UDP communication channel.  So for one TURN server to
         provide the TCP/UDP relay function, it must implement two
         different procedures.  This again increases the complexity of
         the TURN server implementation, especially in CGN devices.

   o  Communication complexity between two different TURN servers

         Current TURN solution cannot assure two hosts select the same
         TURN server, and then it must deal with the communication
         situation between two different TURN servers.  This scenario
         has not been covered by the current TURN related drafts.  The
         communication complexity of different TURN server arises from
         the communication procedures, the transfer of the relay
         addresses of the two TURN servers and the permission list
         creation etc.

         On the other hand, because the hosts select their own TURN
         server, there is no mechanism to assure the relayed path is
         most optimal for them.  The application latency will be
         increased when this occurs.

   TURN-Lite architecture and solution will simplify the above mentioned
   complexity and make the TCP/UDP data relay function be easily
   incorporated into the existing distributed CGN devices or other kinds
   distributed devices i.e. the CDN nodes etc.

1.2.  Relationship with TURN

   This document doesn't intent to replace TURN with TURN-Lite, but
   consider TURN-Lite as a complementary solution along with TURN for
   some specific scenarios.

   If one SP wants to open its infrastructure to accelerate their
   customers' (mainly regarding to application providers) client-to-
   client communications within the SP's domain, TURN-Lite could be a
   good candidate.

2.  Requirements Language and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119] when they appear in ALL CAPS.  When these words are not in
   ALL CAPS (such as "should" or "Should"), they have their usual
   English meanings, and are not to be interpreted as [RFC2119] key
   words.

   o  Application Provider: the service providers who provide client to
      client communications through the Internet.  E.g.  VoIP service
      providers, instant message service providers etc.

   o  Relay Selector: which is in charge of selecting a proper relay
      device (CGN or CDN nodes) for the communicating hosts behind NATs.
      Normally, the RS is a function located in the network's management
      plane and possibly a part of the NMS server

   o  TURN-Lite: lightweight TURN architecture.  The word "lightweight"
      is in the perspective of an application provider.

   o  TURN-Lite Client: the TURN-Lite entity that deployed in the
      application providers' networks; be responsible for TURN-Lite
      signaling/control interactions with the TURN-Lite servers.

   o  TURN-Lite Server: the TURN-Lite entity that deployed in the ISP's
      networks; be mainly responsible for the data relay between an
      application providers' clients.  Normally, the TURN-Lite servers
      collated with the CGNs (Carrier Grade NATs) within the service
      provider.

                      Fig. 3-1: TURN-Lite Arhitecture

   As depicted in above figure, the application clients that located on
   hosts act as the TURN-Lite clients while the CGNs act as TURN-Lite
   Servers.  There is a Relay Selector (RS) for choosing a proper CGN to
   relay traffic between the two hosts.  In practice, the RS could be a
   dedicated server or a function located in the management plane
   servers such as NMS server.

   RS has the intelligent route selection capability to choose a proper
   CGN for a given host pair.  RS sends the data relay indication to the
   selected CGN devices/CDN node via the newly defined "Couple" method.

   BEHAVE compliant and non-BEHAVE compliant NAT traverse [RFC4787]
   [RFC5382] is supported in TURN-Lite.  IPv6 and IPv4 host
   communication is also supported.

3.2.  Solution Rationale

   The solution could be briefly described in the following sections.

3.2.1.  Relay Selector Reflection and Selection

   Each host that wants to communicate with the other host should send
   STUN message to the RS (Relay Selector), and get their reflex
   addresses to the RS (here we refer to REFLX-RS).

   The application provider needs to select a suitable RS and informs it
   to the hosts (e.g. via application specific client-server protocol).
   The detailed RS selection mechanism and criteria are out of the scope
   of this document, but some general considerations are as the
   following.

   -  If the hosts locate in the same ISP/administrative domain, then
      the RS selection is fairly easy since normally there is only one
      RS in one ISP; even there are multiple RSes in one ISP, the
      application provider should also be able to select a suitable RS
      based on the addresses of the two hosts.

   -  If the hosts locate in two ISPs/administrative domains (assuming
      both of the ISPs providing TURN-Lite service to the application
      provider), the application provider can select one RS based on
      pre-defined policies (the simplest way is just arbitrarily
      choosing one RS in one of the ISPs).

3.2.2.  Relay Selection

   Each host will report its REFLX-RS address to its application server.
   If two hosts want to communicate, the application server will send
   the two hosts' REFLX-RS addresses to the selected RS, to let the RS
   select one appropriate relay device to relay the traffic.

   Generally, the RS can select the appropriate relay device based
   solely on the REFLX-RS addresses of these two hosts, for example,
   select one relay device that locate in the middle of the
   communication path.  This approach is possible since the relay

Internet-Draft         draft-wang-tram-turnlite-02            March 2015


   behavior is within one ISP's domain that the RS could be possible to
   learn the knowledge of all CGNs (relays) within that domain.

   The selection criteria can also be expanded to include other factors,
   such as the privacy concern of the communication peers, the linkage
   usage information between the host and the relay device etc.  For
   example, RS can select one relay device that locates far from the
   communication peer to hide the location of the peer.  This might
   sacrifice the communication efficiency but increase the protection of
   the host privacy.  Anyway, RS has more flexible control over the
   relay selection, upon the requirement of communication hosts, or the
   consideration of relay service provider.

   After the relay device selection, the RS will respond the IP address
   of the selected relay device to the communication peer, together with
   the well known port that used by every relay device.  The combination
   of this relay IP address and the well-known port form the relay
   transport address of the communication peers, each peer will use this
   relay transport address to communicate.

   When two hosts located within one administration domain, the
   centralized relay point selection and control architecture can easily
   achieve one low latency communication path because it knows the whole
   network condition of its own.  When two hosts located within
   different administration domains, the TURN-Lite solution will also
   work except that some end-to-end communication efficiency might be
   sacrificed unless there is some coordination between these two
   administration domains.

3.2.3.  Forming "Couple" Command

   Each host will send again one STUN message to the selected relay
   transport address, get the new reflex address(here we refer to REFLX-
   Relay) to the selected relay device, and reports it to the RS,
   together with the previous reflex address to the RS (which is REFLX-
   RS).

   The RS will use the REFLX-RS addresses to find out which two peers
   will communicate (such communication pair information is gotten from
   Section 3.2.2).  RS will retrieve the corresponding REFLX-Relay
   address of the communication peer, forms the "Couple" command based
   on such information, and sends the "Couple" command to the selected
   relay transport address.

   Upon receiving the "Couple" command, the relay device will add one
   item to its forwarding table.  The forwarding table will bind the
   reflex addresses of the two peers, the required transport protocol
   and other additional information.

Internet-Draft         draft-wang-tram-turnlite-02            March 2015


3.2.4.  Data Relay

   Each host will then send the data traffic directly to the unique
   relay transport address.  The source address of this packet will be
   changed by the alongside NAT devices that located between the host
   and the relay device.

   When this packet arrives to the relay address, its source address
   will be one of the RFLEX-Relay addresses.  The relay device will
   search the forwarding table that formed in Section 3.2.3.  If the
   REFLX-Relay address in one item match the source address of the
   received packet, then the other REFLX-Relay address will be retrieved
   and be used as the destination address of the application packet, the
   packet's source address will be changed to the relay transport
   address.

   After the conversion, the packet will be sent by the relay device.
   This packet will be routed to the corresponding peer, according to
   its REFLX-Relay address.

   The application return packet will be sent again back to the same
   relay device via the relay transport address.  The similar search
   process and convert work will be done by the relay device.  The
   converted return packet will then be routed to the packet originator.

4.  New STUN Method Definition

   In order to let the CGN device to build one Couple item upon the
   request of RS, it is needed to define one general Couple message to
   transfer the related information.

4.1.  Couple Operation

   The Couple request defines the relationship between two TCP or UDP
   half-connections, the translation rule that converts both the source
   address and destination address of pass through packet in both
   directions.

   Couple Opcode: It defines how to bind two half-connections that ends
   at the CGN's well-known relay transport address together.  When CGN
   device receives the Couple request, it will create one map table item
   that includes the reflex IP address/port [REFLX-Relay] of both hosts
   that lies behind the NAT device and the protocol that the host will
   use to communicate.

   When the CGN device receives the packet from one host, it will use
   the reflex source address/port to lookup the map table item; converts
   the source address/port of this packet to the relay transport address

   of the CGN device and converts the destination address/port of this
   packet to the reflex address [REFLX-Relay] that results from the map
   table lookup action.

   The converted packet will be routed to NAT side of the other host,
   converted by the NAT device and then to the other host.  The return
   packet will be delivered to the relay transport address of CGN/CDN
   device and be converted in reverse accordingly.

4.2.  Couple Operation Packet Format

   The Couple Opcode allows RS to create a new explicit couple table on
   the CGN device(TURN-Lite Server), instructs the CGN device to
   accomplish the related translation work.

5.  Detailed Example

5.1.  Procedures of Communication Traversing Symmetric NATs

   When one of the communication hosts located behind the symmetric NAT
   device, the host-to-host communication must via one relay device.
   Below are the key procedures of TURN-Lite solution, we use the Fig
   3-1 to describe the example.

   Please note the communication procedures between the hosts and the
   application server are out of the scope of this document, we only
   focus on the key procedure proposed by this document.

   1.  If Host 1 and Host 2 want to communicate with each other, they
       will send STUN binding message to the RS IPv4 address/port, get
       their reflex address to RS[REFLX-RS].

   2.  RS will select one CGN device to relay the packet, based on the
       RS addresses information of the two peers.  Here we assume it
       select CGN-1 as the relay device.  RS will notify Host 1 and Host
       2 of their relay transport address, both will use the same relay
       IP address/port on CGN-1.

   3.  Host 1 and Host 2 will send STUN binding message to CGN-1, get
       their relay address to CGN-1[REFLX-Relay] and report them to RS,
       together with RS addresses gotten in step 1).  Here we assume the
       [REFLX-Relay] address of Host 1 is 192.0.2.1:7000, and [REFLX-
       Relay] address of Host 2 is 192.0.2.150:32102.

Internet-Draft         draft-wang-tram-turnlite-02            March 2015


   4.  RS will form the "Couple" message, which include mainly the
       [REFLX-Relay] addresses of Host 1 and Host 2 and their
       communication protocol, here we assume they use TCP to
       communicate.

   5.  Upon receiving the "Couple" message, the CGN-1 device will form
       one forwarding table that look like below:

    +-------------------------------------------------------------+
    | Reflextive transport    |  Reflextive transport  | Transport|
    | address of Host1        |  address of Host2      | Protocol |
    +-------------------------|------------------------|----------+
    |  192.0.2.1:7000         |  192.0.2.150:32102     |   TCP    |
    +-------------------------------------------------------------+

             Table 5-1: Couple Table Example (symmetric case)

   6.  Host1 will send the application data to the relay transport
       address in CGN-1.

   7.  CGN device will look up the Couple table, use the source address
       of received packet(192.0.2.1:7000 in this example) to get the
       reflex IPv4 address of Host 2.

   8.  It then will change the source address of the packet to the relay
       transport address in CGN device, the destination address of this
       packet to the IPv4 reflex address of Host 2.  The translated
       packet will be forwarded to Host 2.

   9.  The return traffic will also be sent to the same relay transport
       address in CGN-1, converted by the CGN device, and sent back to
       Host 1.

5.2.  Procedures of IPv4 and IPv6 Host Communication

   If Host 1 is one IPv4 node and Host 2 is one IPv6 node.  The
   communication process are similar, except the relay address that is
   sent to the Host 1 is the IPv4 address of the CGN-1 and the relay
   address that is sent to the Host 2 is the IPv6 address of the CGN-1.
   Host 1 and Host 2 will not notice that they are talking to one node
   that in different address family.

   The relay device selection process is same as the above example.
   Here we describe the procedure from step 3.

   3. Host 1 and Host 2 will send STUN binding message to CGN-1, get
      their relay address to CGN-1[REFLX-Relay] and report them to RS,
      together with RS addresses gotten in step 1).  Here we assume the

Internet-Draft         draft-wang-tram-turnlite-02            March 2015


      [REFLX-Relay] address of Host 1 is 192.0.2.1:7000, and [REFLX-
      Relay] address of Host 2 is 2001:c68:300:105::1[49191].

   4. RS will form the "Couple" message, which include mainly the
      [REFLX-Relay] addresses of Host 1 and Host 2 and their
      communication protocol, here we assume they use TCP to
      communicate.

   5. Upon receiving the "Couple" message, the CGN-1 device will form
      one forwarding table that look like below:

    +-------------------------------------------------------------+
    | Reflextive transport   |   Reflextive transport  | Transport|
    | address of Host1       |   address of Host2      | Protocol |
    +-------------------------------------------------------------+
    |  192.0.2.1:7000        |   2001:c68:300:105::1[49191] UDP   |
    +-------------------------------------------------------------+

     Table 5-2: Couple Table Example (different address families case)

   6. Host1 will send the application data to the relay transport
      address in CGN-1.

   7. CGN device will look up the Couple table, use the source address
      of received packet(192.0.2.1:7000 in this example) to get the
      reflex IPv6 address of Host 2.

   8. It then will change the source address of the packet to the relay
      transport IPv6 address in CGN device, the destination address of
      this packet to the IPv6 reflex address of Host 2.  The translated
      packet will be forwarded to Host 2.

   9. The return traffic will also be sent to the same relay transport
      address in CGN-1, converted by the CGN device, and sent back to
      Host 1.

6.  TURN-Lite Benefits

   TURN-LiteTURN-LiteComparing to TURN, TURN-Lite could provide
   following benefits:

   o  Decoupled from ICE

         TURN is tightly coupled with ICE.  Operations like NAT
         punching, create permission .etc all require ICE connectivity
         check packets.





Wang & Liu             Expires September 10, 2015              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft         draft-wang-tram-turnlite-02            March 2015


         Benefited from the couple operation, TURN-Lite doesn't
         necessarily need ICE interaction.

   o  Avoid the Create Permission issues in TURN

         In the TURN-Lite solution, each communication pair will use the
         same relay server and the same relay address.  The relay
         permission action required by TURN solution is replaced with
         the "Couple" command.  There is no ambiguity for the relay
         permission because "Couple" command use the ip address and port
         information of the communication pair simultaneously.  There
         are also no possible attacks due to the loose control of the
         current TURN permission treaments.

   o  Less Relay Address/Port Consumption and Management

         TURN-LiteTURN-Lite doesn't need to allocate different address-
         port pair for each session initiated from the hosts.  Thus, it
         could obviously reduce the resource consumption and the human
         burden for planning the resource allocation.

   o  Simplified Procedures

         Theoretically, it requires only two commands to accomplish the
         relay function, compared with over eight commands that required
         by TURN solution.  Due to every host communicate with the well-
         known relay address, there is no additional requirement for
         punching holes in the NAT devices, which is indispensable for
         the current TURN solution.

   o  Unified solution for TCP/UDP and IPv4(6)-IPv6(4) data relay





Wang & Liu             Expires September 10, 2015              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft         draft-wang-tram-turnlite-02            March 2015


         TURN-Lite supports the data relay for the communication between
         two hosts, uses same mechanism for TCP and UDP transport
         protocol, even for the communication between different address
         families.

   o  Support for optimal relay selection

         Because of the central deployed RS could have the whole
         network's routing/path knowledge, TURN-Lite is more likely to
         achieve an optimal relay (TURN-Lite server) selection based on
         various information such as the reflective transport addresses
         of the two communicating peers, the link usage information
         between two peers and the load status of the candidate TURN-
         Lite servers etc.

         With the RS's knowledge, TURN-Lite is also more likely to
         achieve better relay selection for some specific requirements.
         For example, if one peer wants to hide its ip address to
         protect its privacy, the RS in TURN-Lite architecture could
         possibly select one TURN-Lite server that located far away from
         the host.

7.  TURN-Lite Deployment Considerations

   The TURN-Lite Server can be deployed in distributed manner.  The most
   appropriate devices for incorporating this function are the CGN
   devices that have been deployed distributed by the service provider.
   Each distributed TURN-Lite Server has one unique public IPv4/IPv6
   transport address.

   The RS can select the appropriate TURN-Lite Server based on the
   proximity of the TURN-Lite server with the communication hosts and
   can also use other criteria to influence the selection procedure, as
   described in Section 3.

8.  Security Considerations

   The additional requirement of TURN-Lite is authenticating the couple
   operation from the RS.  When the communication channel between the RS
   and the TURN-Lite server is secured, such security risks can be
   mitigated accordingly.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This draft requires IANA to allocate following STUN methods:

   Couple: value TBD.

   Decouple: value TBD.

10.  Conclusions

   Currently, the communication between two hosts that located behind
   NAT devices, especially that behind the symmetric NAT devices is
   emerging.  With the development of IPv6 technology, the communication
   between two hosts that in different address families needs also be
   considered.  Under the TURN-Lite architecture, the communication
   requests for IPv4/IPv4, IPv4/IPv6 scenario can be met in one general
   solution.  Such solution can alleviate the burden of various CP/SP to
   deploy the TURN server by themselves, exploit and open the
   capabilities of CGN device that deployed by service provider to the
   third party(CP/SP), make the host-to-host communication more
   efficient.
