1. Introduction

   As VoLTE is a crucial service for telecommunication operators, it
   becomes more important to provide secure voice and messaging
   communication services. VoLTE and VoIP are based on IP, attacks such
   as compromising the telephony application or re-routing the IP
   signal can be happened.

   This document describes IP-based communications security use cases
   for Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) such as VoIP,
   VoLTE and messaging service.

Internet-Draft     Use Cases for the Communication Security    November
2016


3.2. Use Case of Voice Call Security

   The procedure of VoIP/VoLTE voice call security operations is as
   follows:

   1. Communications Security Manager(I2NSF Client) sends rules to
      Communication Security Controller to block packets or flows that
      match conditions that operators configure. In voice call security,
      those rules can be prevention of the Caller ID spoofing or DDoS
      attack.

   2. Communication Security Controller creates and sends the data
      model that the Communication Security Function can understand.
      The data model includes the Events, Conditions and Actions. In
      this use case Events can be originating call by user action and
      Conditions can be IP address and port of origination and
      termination device, User-Agent of device, media information of
      device such as SDP(Session Description Protocol) and call state
      such as call setup state, conversation state. Actions can be
      packet or flow permit, drop, forward to Communication Security
      Controller or updating and applying Communication Security
      Profile.

   3. Communication Security Function applies the rules which are sent
      in forms of data model from the Security Controller. After
      applying the rules, it monitors the flows and packets. If the
      underlay network is SDN-enabled network, it requests the SDN
      controller to apply the security rules with APIs. The SDN
      switches monitor requested events and when the events match the
      rule, they drop, permit, mirror or forward to the SDN controller.

   4. When Communication Security Function detects the flows or packets
      that meet the Conditions, it performs Actions that Communication
      Security Controller defines with data model. In case of Caller ID
      spoofing prevention, Communication Security Function mirrors the
      packets to Communication Security Controller and Communication
      Security Controller determine whether they are manipulated or not
      with the combination of IP address of the call, Caller-ID, and
      URIs of the call.

   5. If Communication Security Controller determines that the
      forwarded packets must be dropped, it updates the policy rule or
      Communication Security Profile to drop the packet and send the
      update rules to Communication Security Function.

   6. Communication Security Function updates the rule of data model
      and performs the Actions that Communication Security Controller
      defines. In case of Caller ID spoofing, Communication Security
      Function tears down the call.

3.3. Use Case of prevention of VoIP/VoLTE device scanning

   The procedure of detection and prevention of VoIP/VoLTE device
   scanning to find vulnerable to hacking is as follows:

   1. Communications Security Manager(I2NSF Client) sends rules to
      Communication Security Controller to block packets or flows that
      try to scan the VoIP/VoLTE devices that are vulnerable to hacking
      for fraud call. In this case, those rules can be prevention of
      the scanning of customer's communication devices.

   2. Communication Security Controller creates and sends the data
      model that includes the Events, Conditions and Actions. In this
      use case Events can be originating call by user action and
      Conditions can be statistics of accumulated call attempt counts
      from each source IP address or each originating phone number,
      signal message type such as INVITE, OPTIONS, REGISTER in SIP.
      Actions can be packet or flow permit, drop, forward to
      Communication Security Controller or updating and applying
      Communication Security Profile.

   3. Communication Security Function applies the rules which are sent
      in forms of data model from the Security Controller. After
      applying the rules, it monitors the flows and packets. To monitor
      the statistics of the packet or call attempt count, Communication
      Security Function needs the Statistics Processor. Statistics
      Processor counts packets and calls from each source IP address or
      originating number within specific duration such as per minute,
      hour or day.

   4. When Communication Security Function detects the flows or packets
      that meet the Conditions, it performs Actions that Communication
      Security Controller defines with data model. In case of device
      scanning prevention, Communication Security Function manages the
      statistics. When a statistics matches the threshold value,
      Communication Security Function forwards the packets to
      Communication Security Controller and Communication Security
      Controller determine whether they are packets for the device
      scanning or not with the statistics of the accumulated packet or
      call count within specific time duration.

   5. If Communication Security Controller determines that the
      forwarded packets are for device scanning, it updates the policy
      rule or Communication Security Profile to drop the packets and
      send the update rules to Communication Security Function.

   6. Communication Security Function updates the rule of data model
      and performs the Actions that Communication Security Controller
      defines. In case of device scanning, Communication Security
      Function drops the packets.

3.4. Use Case of prevention of spam messages

   The procedure of detection and prevention of spam messages such as
   SMS, MMS is as follows:

   1. Communications Security Manager(I2NSF Client) sends rules to
      Communication Security Controller to block packets or flows that
      sends spam messages. In this case, those rules can be blocking of
      the messages that exceed the threshold message sending count or
      contain the banned terms.

   2. Communication Security Controller creates and sends the data
      model that includes the Events, Conditions and Actions. In this
      use case Events can be sending message by user action and
      Conditions can be statistics of accumulated message sending
      counts from each source IP address or each originating phone
      number and terms in the message within specified range of the
      message packet. Actions can be packet or flow permit, drop,
      forward to Communication Security Controller or updating and
      applying Communication Security Profile and Signature file.

   3. Communication Security Function applies the rules which are sent
      in forms of data model from the Security Controller. After
      applying the rules, it monitors the flows and packets. To monitor
      the message sending statistics, Communication Security Function
      needs the Statistics Processor. Statistics Processor counts
      message sending counts from each source IP address or originating
      number within specific duration such as per minute, hour or day.
      Also Communication Security Function checks the message content
      whether it contains the banned terms within specified range of
      the message packet.

   4. When Communication Security Function detects the flows or packets
      that meet the Conditions, it performs Actions that Communication
      Security Controller defines with data model. In case of device
      spam message prevention, Communication Security Function manages
      the statistics. When a statistics matches the threshold value,
      Communication Security Function forwards the packets to
      Communication Security Controller. Communication Security
      Controller determines whether they are packets for the spam or
      not with the statistics.

   5. If Communication Security Controller determines that the
      forwarded packets are for spam, it updates the policy rule or
      Communication Security Profile to drop the packets and send the
      update rules to Communication Security Function.

   6. Communication Security Function updates the rule of data model
      and performs the Actions that Communication Security Controller
      defines. In case of spam prevention, Communication Security
      Function drops the packets and updates the Signature file adding
      the new banned terms.
