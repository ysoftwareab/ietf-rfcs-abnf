Internet-Draft     Optimized Local Routing for PMIPv6       October 2009


Abstract

   Base Proxy Mobile IPv6 requires all communications to go through the
   local mobility anchor.  As this can be suboptimal, local routing has
   been defined to allow mobile nodes attached to the same or different
   mobile access gateways to exchange traffic by using local forwarding
   or a direct tunnel between the gateways.  This document proposes an
   initiation method and fast handover mechanisms for local routing.
   The solutions aim at reducing handover delay and packet loss.

Internet-Draft     Optimized Local Routing for PMIPv6       October 2009


1.  Introduction

   Base Proxy Mobile IPv6 requires all communications to go through the
   LMA [RFC5213].  In the case where both endpoints are located in the
   same PMIPv6 domain, this can be suboptimal and results in higher
   delay and congestion in the network.  Moreover, it increases
   transport costs and traffic load at the LMA.

   To overcome this situation, local routing has been defined to allow
   nodes attached to the same or different mobile access gateways to
   exchange traffic by using local forwarding or a direct tunnel between
   the gateways.  [I-D.ietf-netext-pmip6-lr-ps] details the local
   routing problem statement.

                     Figure 1: Local Routing Scenario

   Figure 1 defines a scenario where local routing could be used.  MN1
   and MN2 are communicating and are attached to the same PMIPv6 domain.
   MN1 is attached to MAG1 and MN2 is initially attached to MAG2.  The
   LMA triggers the local routing by exchanging messages with the MAGs.
   A tunnel is created between MAG1 and MAG2.

   Regarding handover, suppose MN2 moves from MAG2 to MAG3.  Based on
   PMIPv6 specification, MN2 does an attach on MAG3.  MAG3 performs
   authentication then sends a PBU to the LMA.  If there is no local
   routing, the traffic is switched towards MAG3 at this point.
   However, local routing imply that traffic from MN1 do not reach LMA
   but is routed directly towards MAG2.  Therefore, the LMA has to send
   a message to MAG1 in order to switch traffic.  This results in worst
   handover performance than base PMIPv6.

4.  Operations

   The operations described here are based on the scenario presented in
   Figure 1.

4.1.  Local Routing Initialization

   When the LMA notices that Local Routing should be initiated between
   two MNs, it sends one LRI message to each MAG where the MNs are
   attached.  The LRI messages contains information to identify both
   MNs, the target MAG which will be the other endpoint of the tunnel
   and some data needed to establish a security association between the
   MAGs.  Note that we can have pre-established security associations
   between the MAGs of the same PMIPv6 domain.  The LRI MAY also
   includes GRE Keys and a Tunnel mode option to indicate which type of
   tunneling SHOULD be used between the MAGs.  The Tunnel mode is
   determined based on the information the LMA have on the MAGs
   capabilities.  Note that the tunnel mode MAY also be preconfigured
   between MAGs.

   If the MAG accepts to apply local routing, it sends a LRA message to
   the LMA to acknowledge the Local Routing.  At this point, the LMA
   MUST not modify the binding of the MN as other communications MAY
   still go through the LMA.  The LMA MUST record that there is an
   ongoing Local Routing session and also the involved MAGs and MNs.
   How the charging is done when local routing is in place is out of
   scope of this document.

   Note also that this initiation mechanism can be extended to work in
   scenarios where the MAGs are attached to different LMAs.  In this
   case, extra signalling will be required between the LMAs before they
   initiate the local routing process.  How the LMAs discover each
   others is out of scope of this document.

                  Figure 2: Local Routing Initialization

4.2.  Handover

   The handover mechanisms proposed here are proactive.  They are based
   on the fact that the moving MN is able to send information to the MAG
   it is still attached to about the target access point or MAG.  Those
   information are used by the old MAG to identify the target MAG.  Note
   that a MN which does not support this specification performs base
   PMIPv6 handover and the LMA has to restart the Local Routing session
   later.

4.2.1.  Non optimized handover

   In this mechanism, before moving to MAG3, MN2 sends a Handover
   Initiate message to MAG2.  This message MAY be L2 or L3 specific and

Internet-Draft     Optimized Local Routing for PMIPv6       October 2009


   MUST provide MAG2 with useful information to resolve MAG3's address.
   For example, in 3GPP LTE networks, the Mobility Management Entity
   (MME) may generate this message towards the old Serving Gateway with
   the result that no modification is needed on the MN side.  The
   details of this message is out of scope for this document.

   If the target MAG is different from MAG2, MAG2 sends a refresh PBU
   message to the LMA containing a new flag indicating a possible
   movement.  When receiving this PBU, the LMA MUST not update the BCE
   but rather abort the Local Routing sessions by sending a
   deregistration LRI message to MAG1.  Therefore, MAG1 switches back
   the traffic towards the LMA.  At this time, the traffic is asymmetric
   as the local routing from MAG2 to MAG1 is unaffected.  When the LMA
   receives the PBU indicating the new attach point of MN2, it can start
   over a new Local Routing session between MN1 and MN2.  Figure 3 shows
   this mechanism.  Even if we refer to this method as non-optimized, it
   allows to reduce packet loss and handover delay.  Another option
   could be for the LMA to send to MAG1 a LRI to directly set up the
   tunnel towards MAG3.

   Note also that this method can be applied without any specific fast
   mobility mechanisms.  The difference will be that instead of
   resolving MAG3's address, MAG2 detects MN2's detach and send a
   deregistration PBU as recommended by [RFC5213].

4.2.2.  Optimized handover

   We assume here that Local Routing sessions MUST be maintained after
   handover.  Before moving to MAG3, MN2 sends a Handover Initiate
   message to MAG2.  MAG2 resolves MAG3 address.  Then it sends a LRI
   message to inform MAG1 that MN2 will be attached to MAG3.  It also
   sends a LRI message to inform MAG3 to start a Local Routing session
   with MAG1.  To perform this, there need to be SA between each MAG and
   all its neighbour which support Local Routing and where a MN may
   move.  This SA is used to exchange LRI/LRA messages between MAG2 and
   MAG3.  After this, the Local Routing session is established between
   MAG1 and MAG3.  MN2 can resume communications right after attachment
   with MAG3 if MAG3 advertises MN2's prefix before completing the PBU/
   PBA exchange or packet may be buffered until the PBA is received by
   MAG3.  Figure 4 shows this mechanism.  If this mechanism is used,
   MAG3 MUST include an indication in the PBU to let the LMA know that
   the LR session is now between MAG1 and MAG3.

   In this method, MAG2 suggest a tunnelling mode and GRE Keys to MAG1
   and MAG3.  MAG2 SHOULD suggest the same tunnelling mode and GRE keys
   he was using unless he has specific information allowing a more
   accurate choice.  In any case, if MAG1 and MAG3 rejects the
   suggestion of MAG2, they MUST directly negotiate the tunnelling mode
   and the GRE keys.

   Another option could be for the MAG2 to send a LRI only to MAG3 in
   order to establish temporary Local Routing session between MAG2 and
   MAG3.  Therefore, packets follow the path MAG1-MAG2-MAG3 during
   handover and the normal Local Routing path is restored after
   handover.  However, this imply an additional tunnelling step and
   requires the LMA to establish a direct LR session between MAG1 and
   MAG3.

   In case the MAGs are attached to different LMAs, extra inter-LMA
   signalling is required to updated the LR states in each LMA.

                       Figure 4: Optimized handover

4.3.  IPv4 considerations

   In case of IPv4 Home Addresses used over IPv6 transport, the proposed
   mechanisms works well and the chosen tunnelling mode MUST be IPv4
   over IPv6.  The GRE Keys MUST also be present to differentiate
   private IPv4 HoAs.

   If IPv4 transport is involved, the tunnelling mode suggested by MAG2
   MAY not be accurate as NATs may be involved.  In this case, unless
   there are preconfigured tunnels, the MAGs MUST directly negotiate the
   tunnelling mode.

5.  Messages formats

   This protocol requires two new messages, Local Routing Indication
   (LRI) and Local Routing Acknowledgement (LRA) messages.  They use MH
   type (IANA-TBD).  Figure 5 shows the MH.  If the Local Routing type
   is set to 1, it is a Local Routing Indication message (Section 5.1).
   If it is set to 2, it is a Local Routing Acknowledgement message
   Section 5.2).

6.  Security Considerations

   Message between the LMA and the MAGs MUST be exchanged using the
   security associations existing for PBU/PBA messages.  If inter-MAG
   signaling messages are used, there MUST be a SA between the MAGs as a
   malicious node can trigger a Local Routing session update.
