Abstract

   This document proposes the addition of new cipher suites to the TLS
   protocol version 1.0 to support the MISTY1 encryption algorithm as a
   bulk cipher algorithm.

1. Introduction

   This document proposes the addition of new cipher suites to the TLS
   protocol version 1.0[2] to support MISTY1 encryption algorithm[1] as
   a bulk cipher algorithm.  MISTY1 is a block cipher with a 128-bit key
   and a 64-bit block.  It is designed on the basis of the theory of
   provable security against differential and linear cryptanalysis, and
   moreover it realizes high-speed encryption on hardware platforms as
   well as on software environments.

Internet-Draft         Addition of MISTY1 to TLS          September 2000


   This document defines the additional cipher specification to the TLS
   protocol version 1.0.

2. The Cipher Suites

   The following values define the CipherSuite codes for the cipher
   suites that use the MISTY1 CBC mode as a bulk cipher algorithm.

    CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_MISTY1_CBC_SHA            = { 0x00,0xXX };
    CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_MISTY1_CBC_SHA         = { 0x00,0xXX };
    CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_MISTY1_CBC_SHA         = { 0x00,0xXX };
    CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_MISTY1_CBC_SHA        = { 0x00,0xXX };
    CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_MISTY1_CBC_SHA        = { 0x00,0xXX };
    CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_MISTY1_CBC_SHA        = { 0x00,0xXX };

   Note: Above CipherSuite numbers should be assigned and registerd.

   Note: Key Exchange Algorithms and Hash Functions are defined in TLS.

4. Security Considerations

   MISTY1 cipher suites are subject to the same security consideration
   as TLS.  In addition, MISTY1 is designed in consideratin of the
   theory of provable security against differential and liner
   cryptanalysis.
