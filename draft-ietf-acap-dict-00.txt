Abstract

    The Application Configuration Access Protocol [ACAP] is designed to
    support remote storage and access of common application option,
    configuration and preference information.  Its main benefits are in
    providing a way for users to gain access to personal information
    from any computer at a location supporting an internet connection,
    by keeping this information stored centrally on a server.
    Additionally, it allows 'kiosk' style use of computers so that users
    do not need to store data locally on a shared or public workstation
    or network computer. This specification defines a standard dataset
    class for personal dictionaries that would allow users to keep one
    or more 'user dictionaries' stored on an ACAP server for access by
    any ACAP-aware application that requires such information, for
    example any application that uses a spell checker.

1.  Introduction

    Various types of dataset have been designed to operate with
    ACAP [ACAP]. Among these are options [REF] and addressbooks [REF],
    allowing storage of personal options or preferences, and personal
    addressbooks. This specification defines the 'dictionary' dataset
    class to be used for storing personal dictionary information, for
    use, for example, with spelling checkers.

    Currently many different desktop applications support different
    spellchecker modules, most requiring their own main and user-defined
    dictionaries. The dictionary dataset in ACAP is designed to address
    the problem of having to maintain separate user dictionaries for a
    variety of applications on a single computer, as well as on
    different computers. The aim of the dictionary dataset in ACAP is to
    ensure that a user's personal dictionary is always synchronized
    across applications and computers. ACAP-aware spellcheckers can make
    use of this capability by storing and accessing their user-defined
    dictionaries through ACAP.

    This dataset is not meant to be used for the main dictionary (which
    is usually large) that is normally provided with a spell checker,
    but merely for the few hundred or thousand words a user may add as
    they use the spell checker.

    Additionally, this draft does not describe the spellchecking process
    itself. That will always be left to the local client implementation.

    One aim of this draft is to go further than conventional
    spellcheckers by allowing additional information about words to be
    stored. This will take the form of a classic 'paper-based'
    dictionary which includes definitions of words, for example. This
    additional information is optional, but may be useful for grammar
    checkers or other programs that require more details about a word.

2.  Conventions Used in this Document

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in "Key words for use in
    RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [KEYWORDS].

3.  ACAP Personal Dictionaries

3.1. ACAP Personal Dictionary Dataset Prefix

    Datasets whose names begin with "/dictionary" are assumed to contain
    dictionary entries as defined in this specification.

3.2. ACAP Dictionary Hierarchy

    Hierarchical dictionaries SHOULD be represented using ACAP 
    hierarchy.  Any entry in a dictionary can also be a hierarchy node
    by setting the "subdataset" attribute.

4.  Recommended ACAP Attributes

    The following attributes MAY be used in an ACAP dictionary entry. A
    dictionary entry MUST have an "entry" attribute and a "lang"
    attribute.

    Beyond this rule, clients MAY choose any subset of the basic
    attributes described below, as well as using registered private
    attributes. Clients are encouraged to provide a way to view all
    textual attributes in an entry regardless of whether the client
    knows the special semantics associated with them.

    The ABNF defines the content of the attribute values prior to their
    encoding as an ACAP string. Clients MUST conform to the syntax when
    generating these attributes, but MUST NOT assume that the attribute
    values will conform to this syntax on access. Servers MUST NOT
    enforce the syntax. Unless otherwise stated, all attributes in this
    specification are single-valued and textual.

4.1. Basic Attributes

    These attributes are defined in ACAP [ACAP] and have meaning in all
    dataset classes. This section describes how they are used in an
    dictionary dataset.

    entry
        The word, or title of a subdictionary. This attribute MUST be
        present in the dataset entry.

    lang
        IANA registered language tag. The language tag is used to
        identify which language this word is used in. It is used to
        allow multi-lingual dictionaries. This attribute MUST be
        present in the dataset entry.

    definition
        Definition of word (may be multivalued). This provides an
        entry for the classic 'paper-based' dictionary definition of
        the word.

    grammar
        Grammatical context (noun, verb, adjective etc - may be
        multivalued). This attribute should be kept synchronized
        with the 'definition' attribute so that there is exactly one
        value for each corresponding value in the 'definition'
        attribute.

Internet DRAFT       ACAP Personal Dictionary Dataset       March 1998


    pronunciation.human
        Human pronunciation using some defined phonetic description.
        This must be related to the language tag in use.

    pronunciation.machine
        Machine pronunciation using some defined phonetic
        description. This must be related to the language tag in
        use. This attribute provides a way for computer based
        "text-to-speech" processing engines to determine the correct
        pronunciation of a word.

    synonyms
        ACAP urls to other words that are synonyms of this word (may
        be multivalued), or words that are synonyms of this word and
        don't have an entry in this dataset (e.g. they are in the
        main dictionary and reside on the client machine).

    homonyms
        ACAP urls to other words that are homonyms of this word (may
        be multivalued), or words that are synonyms of this word and
        don't have an entry in this dataset (e.g. they are in the
        main dictionary and reside on the client machine).

    capitalize
        value: true/false - indicates whether the word should always
        appear with the first letter capitalized.

    real name
        value: true/false - indicates that the word represents a real
        name.

    subdataset
        Indicates a sub-dictionary exists. If set, the 'entry'
        attribute corresponds to the name of the sub-dictionary.

    plural
        The plural form of the word.

    expand
        Expansion of the entry if it is an abbreviation or acronym.
