1.  Introduction

   There are several situations where it is useful for the IS-IS
   [ISO10589] [RFC1195] routers to learn the capabilities of the other
   routers of their IS-IS level, area, or routing domain.  For the sake
   of illustration, three examples related to MPLS Traffic Engineering
   (TE) are described here:

   1.  Mesh-group: the setting up of a mesh of TE Label Switched Paths
       (LSPs) [RFC5305] requires some significant configuration effort.
       [RFC4972] proposes an auto-discovery mechanism whereby every
       Label Switching Router (LSR) of a mesh advertises its mesh-group
       membership by means of IS-IS extensions.

Internet-Draft               isis-rfc4971bis                October 2015


   2.  Point to Multipoint TE LSP (RFC4875).  A specific sub-TLV
       [RFC5073] allows an LSR to advertise its Point To Multipoint
       capabilities ([RFC4875] and [RFC4461]).

   3.  Inter-area traffic engineering: Advertisement of the IPv4 and/or
       the IPv6 Traffic Engineering Router IDs.

   The use of IS-IS for Path Computation Element (PCE) discovery may
   also be considered and will be discussed in the PCE WG.

   The capabilities mentioned above require the specification of new
   sub-TLVs carried within the CAPABILITY TLV defined in this document.

   Note that the examples above are provided for the sake of
   illustration.  This document proposes a generic capability
   advertising mechanism that is not limited to MPLS Traffic
   Engineering.

   This document defines a new optional IS-IS TLV named CAPABILITY,
   formed of multiple sub-TLVs, which allows a router to announce its
   capabilities within an IS-IS level or the entire routing domain.  The
   applications mentioned above require the specification of new sub-
   TLVs carried within the CAPABILITY TLV defined in this document.

   Definition of these sub-TLVs is outside the scope of this document.

2.  IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV

   The IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV is composed of 1 octet for the type,
   1 octet that specifies the number of bytes in the value field, and a
   variable length value field that starts with 4 octets of Router ID,
   indicating the source of the TLV, and followed by 1 octet of flags.

   A set of optional sub-TLVs may follow the flag field.  Sub-TLVs are
   formatted as described in [RFC5305].

Internet-Draft               isis-rfc4971bis                October 2015


    TYPE: 242
      LENGTH: from 5 to 255
      VALUE:
        Router ID (4 octets)
        Flags (1 octet)
        Set of optional sub-TLVs (0-250 octets)

    Flags

                0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
                +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                | Reserved  |D|S|
                +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Currently two bit flags are defined.

   S bit (0x01): If the S bit is set(1), the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV
   MUST be flooded across the entire routing domain.  If the S bit is
   not set(0), the TLV MUST NOT be leaked between levels.  This bit MUST
   NOT be altered during the TLV leaking.

   D bit (0x02): When the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV is leaked from
   level-2 to level-1, the D bit MUST be set.  Otherwise, this bit MUST
   be clear.  IS-IS Router capability TLVs with the D bit set MUST NOT
   be leaked from level-1 to level-2.  This is to prevent TLV looping.

   The Router CAPABILITY TLV is OPTIONAL.  As specified in Section 3,
   more than one Router CAPABILITY TLV from the same source MAY be
   present.

   This document does not specify how an application may use the Router
   Capability TLV and such specification is outside the scope of this
   document.

3.  Elements of Procedure

   The Router ID SHOULD be identical to the value advertised in the
   Traffic Engineering Router ID TLV [RFC5305].  If no Traffic
   Engineering Router ID is assigned the Router ID SHOULD be identical
   to an IP Interface Address [RFC1195] advertised by the originating
   IS.  If the originating node does not support IPv4, then the reserved
   value 0.0.0.0 MUST be used in the Router ID field and the IPv6 TE
   Router ID sub-TLV [RFC5316] MUST be present in the TLV.  Router
   CAPABILITY TLVs which have a Router ID of 0.0.0.0 and do NOT have the
   IPv6 TE Router ID sub-TLV present MUST be ignored.

   When advertising capabilities with different flooding scopes, a
   router MUST originate a minimum of two Router CAPABILITY TLVs, each
   TLV carrying the set of sub-TLVs with the same flooding scope.  For
   instance, if a router advertises two sets of capabilities, C1 and C2,
   with an area/level scope and routing domain scope respectively, C1
   and C2 being specified by their respective sub-TLV(s), the router
   will originate two Router CAPABILITY TLVs:

   -  One Router CAPABILITY TLV with the S flag cleared, carrying the
      sub-TLV(s) relative to C1.  This Router CAPABILITY TLV will not be
      leaked into another level.

   -  One Router CAPABILITY TLV with the S flag set, carrying the sub-
      TLV(s) relative to C2.  This Router CAPABILITY TLV will be leaked
      into other IS-IS levels.  When the TLV is leaked from level-2 to
      level-1, the D bit will be set in the level-1 LSP advertisement.

   In order to prevent the use of stale capabilities, a system MUST NOT
   use a Capability TLV present in an LSP of a system that is not
   currently reachable via Level-x paths, where "x" is the level (1 or
   2) in which the sending system advertised the TLV.  This requirement
   applies regardless of whether or not the sending system is the
   originator of the Capabilities TLV.  Note that leaking a Capabilities
   TLV is one of the uses that is prohibited under these conditions.

      Example: If Level-1 router A generates a Capability TLV and floods
      it to two L1/L2 routers, S and T, they will flood it into the
      Level-2 domain.  Now suppose the Level-1 area partitions, such
      that A and S are in one partition and T is in another.  IP routing
      will still continue to work, but if A now issues a revised version
      of the CAP TLV, or decides to stop advertising it, S will follow
      suit, but T will continue to advertise the old version until the
      LSP times out.

   Routers in other areas have to choose whether to trust T's copy of
   A's capabilities or S's copy of A's information and, they have no
   reliable way to choose.  By making sure that T stops leaking A's
   information, this removes the possibility that other routers will use
   stale information from A.

   In IS-IS, the atomic unit of the update process is a TLV - or more
   precisely, in the case of TLVs that allow multiple entries to appear
   in the value field (e.g., IS-neighbors), the atomic unit is an entry
   in the value field of a TLV.  If an update to an entry in a TLV is
   advertised in an LSP fragment different from the LSP fragment
   associated with the old advertisement, the possibility exists that
   other systems can temporarily have either 0 copies of a particular
   advertisement or 2 copies of a particular advertisement, depending on



Ginsberg, et al.          Expires April 9, 2016                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft               isis-rfc4971bis                October 2015


   the order in which new copies of the LSP fragment that had the old
   advertisement and the fragment that has the new advertisement arrive
   at other systems.

   Wherever possible, an implementation SHOULD advertise the update to a
   capabilities TLV in the same LSP fragment as the advertisement that
   it replaces.  Where this is not possible, the two affected LSP
   fragments should be flooded as an atomic action.

   Systems that receive an update to an existing capability TLV can
   minimize the potential disruption associated with the update by
   employing a holddown time prior to processing the update so as to
   allow for the receipt of multiple LSP fragments associated with the
   same update prior to beginning processing.

   Where a receiving system has two copies of a capabilities TLV from
   the same system that have different settings for a given attribute,
   the procedure used to choose which copy shall be used is undefined.

4.  Interoperability with Routers Not Supporting the Capability TLV

   Routers that do not support the Router CAPABILITY TLV MUST silently
   ignore the TLV(s) and continue processing other TLVs in the same LSP.
   Routers that do not support specific sub-TLVs carried within a Router
   CAPABILITY TLV MUST silently ignore the unsupported sub-TLVs and
   continue processing those sub-TLVs that are supported in the Router
   CAPABILITY TLV.  How partial support may impact the operation of the
   capabilities advertised within the Router CAPABILITY TLV is outside
   the scope of this document.

   In order for Router CAPABILITY TLVs with domain-wide scope originated
   by L1 Routers to be flooded across the entire domain, at least one
   L1/L2 Router in every area of the domain MUST support the Router
   CAPABILITY TLV.

   If leaking of the CAPABILITY TLV is required, the entire CAPABILITY
   TLV MUST be leaked into another level even though it may contain some
   of the unsupported sub-TLVs.

5.  Security Considerations

   Any new security issues raised by the procedures in this document
   depend upon the opportunity for LSPs to be snooped and modified, the
   ease/difficulty of which has not been altered.  As the LSPs may now
   contain additional information regarding router capabilities, this
   new information would also become available to an attacker.
   Specifications based on this mechanism need to describe the security
   considerations around the disclosure and modification of their

   information.  Note that an integrity mechanism, such as the one
   defined in [RFC5304] or [RFC5310], should be applied if there is high
   risk resulting from modification of capability information.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA assigned a new IS-IS TLV code-point for the newly defined IS-IS
   TLV type named the IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV and defined in this
   document.  The assigned value is 242.
