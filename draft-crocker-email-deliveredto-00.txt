                    Delivered-To Email Header Field
                   draft-crocker-email-deliveredto-00

Abstract

   The address to which email is delivered might be different than any
   of the addresses shown in any of the content header fields that were
   created by the author.  The address used by the mail transport
   service is provided separately, through an envelope SMTP "RCPT TO"
   command.  Before final delivery, handling can entail a sequence of
   addresses that lead to the recipient.  It can be helpful for a
   message to have a common way to record each delivery in such a
   sequence, and to include each address used for that recipient.  This
   specification defines a header field for this information.

1.  Introduction

   The address to which email is delivered might be different than any
   of the addresses shown in any of the [Mail-Fmt] content header fields
   that were created by the author's Mail User Agent (MUA).  The address
   used by the Message Handling Service (MHS) [Mail-Arch] is provided
   separately, through an envelope SMTP "RCPT TO" command [SMTP].

   Delivery is the final processing of an envelope address, with a
   transition of responsibility from the MHS, over to an agent
   responsible for that address (Section 4.3.3 [Mail-Arch]).  After this
   transition there might be further, fresh processing of the message,
   before reaching a final destination.  Each transition of
   responsibility, from the MHS to an agent acting on behalf of the
   envelope address, constitutes a delivery.

   Given aliasing, mailing lists, and the like, the transit of a message
   from its author to a final recipient might include a series of
   submission/delivery events.  It can be helpful for a message to have
   a common way to record each delivery in such a sequence, and to
   include each address that led to the final delivery.

2.  Framework & Terminology

   Unless otherwise indicated, basic architecture and terminology used
   in this specification are taken from:

   o  [Mail-Arch]

   o  [SMTP]

   o  [Mail-Fmt]

   and syntax is specified with:

   o  [ABNF]

   Normative language, per [RFC8174]:

      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
      "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
      described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they
      appear in all capitals, as shown here.

   Discussion of this draft is best conducted in the: ietf-smtp [1]
   mailing list.

3.  Delivered-To:

   This specification defines the "Delivered-To" trace header field, for
   annotating a delivery event and the address to which delivery was
   effected.  A sequence of deliveries, such as when a message goes
   through multiple mailing lists, SHOULD be recorded with a series of
   Delivered-To: header fields.  As with other trace information, each
   additional Delivered-To header field MUST be placed at the 'top' of
   the current message, per Section 4.1.1.4 [SMTP].

   The Delivered-To: header field is added at the time of delivery, when
   responsibility for a message transitions from the Mail Handling
   (Transport) Service to an agent acting on behalf of the specified
   recipient address.  The header field contains the individual address
   used to determine the immediate location for that transition.

   Syntax of the header field is:

   "Delivered-To:" FWS Mailbox CRLF

   Note:    The field records only a single address, for one recipient.

4.  Multi-hop Example

   Sending through a mailing list and on through an alias, traveling:

   1.  Origination @ example.com

   2.  List @ example.org

5.  Security Considerations

   As with Received header-fields, their presence in a message discloses
   handling information and, possibly, personal information.

   Delivering one stored message to multiple recipients creates a
   challenge for representing the separate, individual Delivered-To

   fields -- one for each actual recipient -- without, exposing the
   different mailbox names to each other; such exposure MUST NOT occur.

   An issue specific to this mechanism is disclosure of a sequence of
   addresses, if a message goes through a series of recipient envelope
   address modifications.  The specification calls for each of these
   addresses to be recorded in separate Delivered-To: fields.  This does
   not disclose addresses of other, possible recipients, but it does
   disclose a address-transformation handling path for the recipient.

6.  IANA Considerations

   Registration of the "Delivered-To" header field is requested, per
   [RFC3864]:

   Header field name::    Delivered-To

    Applicable protocol::    mail

   Status::    Standard

   Author/Change controller::    IETF

   Specification document(s):    *** This document ***

   Related information:    None.
