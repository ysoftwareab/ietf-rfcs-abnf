cause=1 is as follows:

      A user agent in a session has purposely preempted a session and 
      is informing the far end user agent, or user agents (if part of a
      conference), and SIP Proxies (if stateful of the session's 
      transactions)

cause=2 is as follows:

      A router has preempted a reservation flow and generated a ResvErr
      (downstream).  The (downstream) UA receiving the ResvErr message 
      generates a BYE request towards the far side UA with a Reason 
      Header with this value indicating that somewhere in between two 
      or more UAs, a router has administratively preempted this session

cause=3 is as follows:

      This cause code is for infrastructures that do not wish to 
      provide the preempted UA a more precise reason that just 
      "preemption".  It is possible that UAs will have code that will 
      indicate the type of preemption event that is contained in the 
      Reason header, and certain domains have expressed this as not 
      being optimal, and wanted to generalize the indication.  This 
      MUST NOT be the initial indication within these domains, as 
      valuable traffic analysis and other NM applications will be 
      generalized as well.  If this cause value is to be implemented, 
      it SHOULD only be done at the final SIP Proxy in such a way that 
      the cause value indicating which type of preemption event 
      actually occurred is changed to this generalized preemption 
      indication to be received by the preempted UA.

cause=4 is as follows:

      A session exists in a hybrid IP/Non-IP infrastructure and the 
      preemption event occurs in the Non-IP portion, and was indicated 
      by that portion that this call termination was due to preemption.
      This is the indication that would be generated by a SIP Gateway 
      towards the SIP UA that is being preempted, traversing whichever 
      SIP Proxies are involved in session signaling (a question of 
      server state).
