   This document describes new ECC groups for use in IKE [IKE] and
   IKEv2 [IKEv2] in addition to the Oakley groups included therein.
   These groups are defined to align IKE with other ECC
   implementations and standards, and in addition, many of them
   provide higher strength than the Oakley groups. It should be noted
   that this document is not self-contained.  It uses the notations
   and definitions of [IKE] and IKEv2 [IKEv2].

1.  Introduction

This document describes groups for use in elliptic curve
Diffie-Hellman in IKE in addition to the Oakley groups included in
[IKE], [IKEv2], and [MODP-IKE].  The document assumes that the reader
is familiar with the IKE protocol and the concept of Oakley Groups, as
defined in RFC 2409 [IKE] and IKEv2 [IKEv2].  The ECC groups given
here are among the fifteen groups that NIST recommends in FIPS 186-2
[FIPS-186-2].

RFC2409 [IKE] defines five standard Oakley Groups - three modular
exponentiation groups and two elliptic curve groups over GF[2^N].  One
modular exponentiation group (768 bits - Oakley Group 1) is mandatory
for all implementations to support, while the other four are optional.
Both elliptic curve groups (Oakley Groups 3 and 4) are defined over
GF[2^N] with N composite.

The Internet-Draft "More MODP Groups For IKE" [MODP-IKE] describes
several additional groups that can be used with IKE and IKEv2.  

The Internet-Draft "ECP Groups For IKE and IKEv2" [ECP-IKE] describes
three elliptic curve groups recommended by NIST.  This document
describes the remaining twelve.

INTERNET-DRAFT   Additional ECC Groups for IKE and IKEv2   January 2006

The reasons for supporting these twelve ellipitc curve groups are are
for bettern alignment with other standards, such as [FIPS 186-2],
[X9.62], [X9.63], and [SEC-2].  Some of these groups also afford
efficiency advantages in hardware applications since the underlying
arithmetic is binary field arithmetic.  The groups proposed are
capable of providing security consistent with both the new Advanced
Encryption Standard and with Triple DES.

These groups could also be defined with the New Group Mode but
including them in this document will encourage interoperability of IKE
and IKEv2 implementations based on elliptic curve groups.

2.  The Additional Elliptic Curve Groups

The groups given in this document are capable of providing security
consistent with AES keys of 128, 192, and 256 bits, and also with TDES
keys of lengths 168 and 112 bits, whose corresponding strengths of 112
and 80 bits, respectively.  The following table, based on tables from
[HOF] and [LEN], gives approximate comparable key sizes for symmetric
systems, ECC systems, and DH/DSA/RSA systems.  The estimates are based
on the running times of the best algorithms known today.

                  Strength   |  ECC2N/ECP |  DH/DSA/RSA
                   80        |  163/192   |  1024
                  112        |  233/224   |  2048 
                  128        |  283/256   |  3072
                  192        |  409/384   |  7680
                  256        |  571/521   |  15360

                  Table 1: Comparable key sizes

Thus, for example, when securing a 192-bit symmetric key, it is
prudent to use either 409-bit ECC or 7680-bit DH/DSA/RSA.  Of course
it is possible to use shorter asymmetric keys, but it should be
recognized in this case that the security of the system is likely
dependent on the strength of the public-key algorithm and claims such
as "this system is highly secure because it uses 192-bit encryption"
are misleading.

The fifteen groups proposed in this document use elliptic curves over
GF[2^N] with N prime or over GF[P] with P prime.  This addresses
concerns expressed by many experts regarding curves defined over
GF[2^N] with N composite -- concerns highlighted by the recent attacks
on such curves due to Gaudry, Hess, and Smart [WEIL] and due to
Jacobson, Menezes and Stein [JMS].

INTERNET-DRAFT   Additional ECC Groups for IKE and IKEv2   January 2006

Seven of the groups proposed here have been assigned identifiers by
IANA [IANA] and the remaining eight might latter be assigned
identifiers by IANA.  A brief summary of the IANA identified groups
for IKE as follows.  Groups with IANA numbers 1 through 4 are
identified in [IKE].  The group with IANA number 5 is identifed in
[MODP-IKE].  The group with IANA number 6, [X9.62] and [SEC 2], with
object identifer sect163r1, but it is not one of the fifteen curves
that NIST recommends [FIPS-186-2].  Nevertheless, it is included here
for backwards interoperability with existing implementations.  The
seven groups with IANA numbers numbers between 7 and 13 have also been
identified in [ECP-IKE] and are included here. Three NIST groups have
proposed numbers 19, 20 and 21 in [ECP-IKE].  The remaining five NIST
groups are suggested and anticipate to be assigned IANA numbers 22 to
26.

The groups recommended for IKE and IKEv2 in this document are the ECC
groups that NIST recommends [FIPS-186-2].  These fifteen ECC groups
are given in the following table.

Three curves are defined at each strength - two curves chosen
verifiably at random (as defined in ANSI [X9.62]), one over a binary
field and another over a prime field, and a Koblitz curve over a
binary field that, which enables especially efficient implementations
due to the special structure of the curve [KOB] and [SOL].

INTERNET-DRAFT   Additional ECC Groups for IKE and IKEv2   January 2006

For elliptic curve groups, the data in the KE payload when using this
group is the octet string representation specified in ANSI X9.62, ANSI
X9.63, FIPS 186-2, and IEEE P1363 of the point on the curve chosen by
taking the randomly chosen secret Ka and computing Ka*G, where * is
the repetition of the group addition.

If the initiator chooses secret i and the responder chooses secret r,
then the KEi is i*G and KEr is r*G.  The raw shared secret is the
x-coordinate (only) of (ir)*G.

2.1 Sixth Group

IKE and IKEv2 implementations SHOULD support an EC2N group with the
following characteristics. This group is assigned id 6 (six). The
curve is based on the Galois Field GF[2^163]. The field size is
163. The irreducible polynomial used to represent the field is:

           u^163 + u^7 + u^6 + u^3 + 1.

The equation for the elliptic curve is:

           y^2 + xy = x^3 + ax^2 + b.

Group Curve a:

  0x07b6882caaefa84f9554ff8428bd88e246d2782ae2

Group Curve b:

Group Generator G: 

  0x030369979697ab43897789566789567f787a7876a654

The order of the generator G defined above is the prime:

  0x03ffffffffffffffffffff48aab689c29ca710279b

The curve order is twice this prime.

The group was chosen verifiably at random using SHA-1 as specified in
[X9.62] from the seed:

  0x24b7b137c8a14d696e6768756151756fd0da2e5c

However, for historical reasons, the method to generate the group from
the seed differs slightly from the method described in
[X9.62]. Specifically the coefficient Group Curve b produced from the
seed is the reverse of the coefficient that would have been produced
by the method described in [X9.62].

4. Security Considerations

Since this document proposes new groups for use within IKE and IKEv2,
many of the security considerations contained within RFC 2409 apply
here as well.

Many of the groups proposed in this document offer higher strength
than the groups in RFC 2409.  This allows the IKE and IKEv2 to offer
security comparable with the proposed AES algorithms.

In addition, since all the new groups are defined over GF[P] with P
prime or GF[2^N] with N prime, they address the concerns expressed
regarding the elliptic curve groups included in RFC 2409, which are
curves defined over GF[2^N] with N composite.  The work of Gaudry,
Hess, and Smart [WEIL] reveal some of the weaknesses in such groups.
