                draft-zzhang-idr-bitmask-route-target-01

Abstract

   This document specifies a new type of Route Target called Bitmask
   Route Target as a BGP Community Container.  The key element of a
   Bitmask Route Target is a Bitmask.  Two Bitmask Route Targets are
   considered equivalent for the purpose of controlling route
   propagation (via Route Target Constraints) and importation if the
   result of logical "AND" operation of the Bitmask of the two is non-
   zero.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all

1.  Introduction

   The importation and propagation of BGP routes can be controlled using
   Route Targets [RFC4364] and Constrained Route Target Distribution
   (RT-C) [RFC4684].  RT-C relies on matching a Route Target prefix.
   The typical matching use case is the full 8-octet encoding of the
   Route Target Extended Community.

   For some applications, it's desirable to have a Route Target with the
   semantic of a bit-string.  For such situations and it may be
   desirable to match such bit-string Route Targets that have specific
   bits set.  This document defines a new type of Route Target for that
   purpose.

   An example use case of this Bitmask Route Target is documented in
   [I-D.zzhang-teas-network-slicing-with-flex-te].

   The use of Bitmask Route Target with Constrained Route Target
   Distribution is specified separately in
   [I-D.zzhang-idr-bgp-rt-constrains-extension].

2.  Specification

   The Bitmask Route Target is a Transitive BGP Community Container of
   type TBD1 [I-D.ietf-idr-wide-bgp-communities].

   The semantics of Global Administrator and Local Administor are
   identical to those in [RFC4360].

   The container's contents is a series of Bitmask Route Targets.  Each
   Bitmask Route Target includes a 1-octet Global Administrator (GA)
   Type, a 1-octet GA Sub-Type, 1-octet GA Length, a variable length GA,
   a 4-octet Local Administrator (LA), a 1-octet Bitmask Length in
   number of octets, and a variable length Bitmask.

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |  GA Type        |  GA Sub-Type  |  GA Length    |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |  Global Administrator (variable length)                       ~
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |  Local Administrator                                          |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |  Bitmask Length |

       ~                   Bitmask (variable length)                   ~
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The following GA Types and corresponding lengths are defined in this
   document:

      1: AS Number, 4-octets

      2: IPv4 Address, 4-octets

      3: IPv6 Address, 16-octets

   The follow GA Sub-Types are defined in this document:

      2: Route-Target

2.1.  Matching Semantics

   A Bitmask Route Target, A, is considered to match Bitmask Route
   Target, B, for the purpose of controlling propagation and importation
   of a route with an attached Bitmask Route Target B if the following
   conditions are met:




Zhang, et al.            Expires 23 October 2021                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft            bitmask-route-target                April 2021


   *  The GA Type, GA Sub-Type, GA Length, GA, and LA fields in A and B
      match.

   *  Either:

      -  The Bitmask Length of A is 0.  In other words, "match all".

      -  The result of the logical "AND" operation of the Bitmask field
         in A and B is not 0.  When A and B have different Bitmask
         Lengths, the shorter Route Target's Bitmask is considered to be
         padded with zeroes for match purposes vs. the longer one.

3.  Error Handling

   A Bitmask Route Target MUST NOT be originated with a RESERVED GA
   Type.  Implementations receiving BGP Routes with a RESERVED Bitmask
   Route Target MUST check its syntactic correctness and MAY silently
   discard it.

   A Bitmask Route Target SHOULD NOT be originated with a Bitmask Length
   of 0.

   A Bitmask Route Target is considered malformed if:

   *  The length of the Bitmask Route Target is less than the minimum
      length of 8: 1-octet GA Type, 1-octet GA Sub-Type, 1-octet GA
      Length, 0-length GA, 4-octet LA, 0-octet Bitmask.

   *  The Bitmask Route Target GA Type is known by the implementation
      and the GA Length is incorrect vs. the registered GA Type.

   *  The total computed length of the Bitmask Route Targets in a BGP
      Community Container is not identical to the BGP Community
      Container Length.  Each Bitmask Route Target's computed length is:
      1-octet GA Type, 1-octet GA Length field, N-octet GA Length value,
      4-octet LA field, 1-octet Bitmask Length, N-octet Bitmask Length
      value.

   BGP Updates containing malformed Bitmask Route Targets should use the
   Treat-as-withdraw behavior for the routes in the Update according to
   [RFC7606].

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not change security aspects as discussed in
   [RFC4364] and [I-D.ietf-idr-wide-bgp-communities].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to assign a BGP Community Container Type
   for the Bitmask Route Target from the "BGP Community Container Types"
   registry for TBD1.

   This document requests IANA to setup a "Bitmask Route Target Global
   Administrator Type Registry".  The initial allocation and policy for
   this registry is:
