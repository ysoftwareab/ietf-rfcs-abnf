1.  Introduction

   SMTP servers add Received: trace headers to mail messages to track
   their progress.  The syntax of those headers is defined in [RFC5321].
   Each header can include optional Additional Registered Clauses that
   log information related to optional SMTP features.

   This document updates the registration criteria for Additional
   Registered Clauses in those headers to Expert Review, and adds two
   new clauses for Server Name Indication (SNI).  The headers can
   include Additional Registered Clauses that add information about
   optional SMTP features.

2.  The Server Name Indication clause

   Server Name Indication or SNI [RFC6066] is an optional TLS feature
   that a TLS client can use to advise a server the name it expects the
   server to have.  When used in the initial negotiation for a STARTTLS
   [RFC3207] session it enables the server to use a certificate with the
   identity that the client expects, as is recommended in [RFC7817] and
   is required for SMTP MTA-STS [RFC8461].  When a client presents a
   name using SNI, the server can log the name using the "sni"
   additional-registered-clause.  When a client presents an encrypted
   name using ESNI [ESNI] the server can log the fact that the client
   did so.

   IANA is requested to add two new entries to the additional-
   registered-clauses registry:

      "sni" - indicates the Server Name Indication was used.

      "name" - the name provided by SNI.  It has the syntax of a Domain
      Name.

      "esni" - indicates whether Encrypted Server Name Indication was
      used.

      "yorn" - the literal string "yes" or "no".

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update the Registration Procedure for the
   Additional-registered-clauses registry to Expert Review.  The IESG
   will appoint the expert(s).

3.1.  Guidance for Designated Expert

   The Designated Expert is expected to check that a proposed
   Additional-registered-clause has a specification that is stable and
   detailed enough to implement the clause and interoperate.  The Expert
   should ensure that the clause name is reasonably related to the
   information it represents, that the contents of the clause are well-
   defined, and that any external references it depends on, e.g., a
   vocabulary of keywords, are stable and well-defined.

4.  Security Considerations

   E-mail is subject to a vast range of threats and abuses.  In a few
   circumstances, a new Additional-registered-clause might disclose
   information to a recipient that was otherwise unavailable.  On the
   other hand, better logging usually makes it easier to diagnose
   failures and attacks.

   If the SNI information in a STARTTLS negotiation is exchanged in
   encrypted form [ESNI] a mail server would generally not have access
   to the SNI, and can only log that ESNI was used.
