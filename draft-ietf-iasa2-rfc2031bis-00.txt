                   The Updated IETF-ISOC Relationship
                     draft-ietf-iasa2-rfc2031bis-00

Abstract

   This document summarises the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) -
   Internet Society (ISOC) relationship, following a major revision to
   the structure of the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) in
   2018.  The IASA was revised under a new "IASA 2.0" structure by the
   IASA2 Working Group, which changed the IETF's administrative, legal,
   and financial structure.  As a result, it also changed the
   relationship between the IETF and ISOC, which made it necessary to
   revise RFC 2031.

1.  Introduction and History

   The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is the body that is
   responsible for the development and maintenance of the Internet
   Standards.  The IETF is primarily a volunteer organization.  Its
   driving force is a group of dedicated high-quality engineers from all
   over the world.  In a structure of working groups, these engineers
   exchange ideas and experience, and through discussion and
   collaboration (both electronically and face-to-face) they strive to
   achieve rough consensus and implement the standards through running
   code.

   The growth of the Internet over several decades also led to the
   growth of the IETF.  More and more people, organizations, and
   companies rely on Internet Standards.  Non-technical issues, such as
   legal, administrative, and financial issues had long been an
   undesirable but unavoidable part of the IETF.  To address these
   issues in 1995 the IETF established the Poised95 Working Group.  Its
   goal was to structure and document the IETF processes in order to
   maximize the flexibility and freedom of IETF engineers so that they
   could work in the way the IETF had always been most successful and to
   honour the IETF credo: "Rough consensus and running code".

   The Poised95 Working Group concluded that the Internet Society
   (ISOC), which was formed in 1992, was the best organization to handle
   all of these legal, administrative, and financial tasks on behalf of
   and in close cooperation with the IETF.  This led to documenting

Internet-Draft     The Updated IETF-ISOC Relationship      November 2018


   things such as the IETF standards process [RFC2026], the IETF
   organizational structure [RFC2028], the IETF Nominating Committee
   (NomCom) procedures [RFC2282], and the IETF-ISOC relationship
   [RFC2031].

   As time passed and operational experience accumulated, additional
   structure was necessary.  As a result, the Internet Administrative
   Support Activity (IASA) was defined in 2005 and documented in
   [RFC4071] and [RFC4371].

   In 2018, the IASA was revised under a new "IASA 2.0" structure by the
   IASA2 Working Group, which made signifincant revisions to the IETF's
   administrative, legal, and financial structure.  One critical outcome
   was that the formation, in close cooperation between the IETF and
   ISOC, of the IETF Administration Limited Liability Company (IETF LLC)
   as a disregarded entity of ISOC.

   As a result of the the IASA 2.0 structure [I-D.ietf-iasa2-struct] and
   formation of the IETF LLC, the relationship between the IETF and ISOC
   has changed.  This document summarises the current state of the IETF
   - ISOC relationship at a high level and replaces [RFC2031].

2.  Main Division of Responsibilities between IETF and ISOC

   The IETF remains responsible for the development and quality of the
   Internet Standards.  The Internet Society will aid the IETF by
   facilitating legal and organizational issues as described below.
   Apart from the roles described below, the IETF and ISOC acknowledge
   that ISOC has no influence whatsoever on the technical content of
   Internet Standards.

3.  Philosophical Relationship with ISOC

   ISOC and the IETF have historically been philosophically aligned.
   ISOC's connection with the IETF community has always played an
   important role in its policy work.  ISOC has always been an advocate
   for multistakeholder processes, which include the technical
   community.  Open standards are an explicit part of one of the focus
   areas in ISOC's mission: Advancing the development and application of
   Internet infrastructure, technologies, and open standards.

4.  ISOC's Role in the IETF Standards Process

   ISOC plays a small role in the IETF standards process.  In
   particular, ISOC assists the standards process by appointing the IETF
   NomCom chair and by confirming IAB candidates who are put forward by
   the IETF NomCom, as described in [RFC7437], and by acting as the last
   resort in the appeals process, as describes in [RFC2026].

Internet-Draft     The Updated IETF-ISOC Relationship      November 2018


5.  The IETF's Role in ISOC

   The IETF plays a role in the governance of ISOC.  Per ISOC's by-laws,
   the IETF appoints a set of trustees to the ISOC Board.  The process
   by which the IETF makes those appointments is defined in [RFC3677].

6.  Legal Relationship with ISOC

   The IETF LLC was organized as a "disregarded entity" of ISOC.  This
   means it operates as a branch or division of ISOC for tax purposes.
   ISOC operates as a U.S. 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization, and
   was founded to support and promote the development of the Internet as
   a global technical infrastructure, a resource to enrich people's
   lives, and a force for good in society.  The Limited Liability
   Company Agreement of IETF Administration LLC, dated August 27 2018,
   is the Operating Agreement that governs the relationship between the
   IETF LLC and ISOC.

   As a result of the creation of the IETF LLC, the IETF now has its own
   legal umbrella.  This IETF LLC structure now covers the IETF
   standards and IETF standards process, all IETF officers (IAB, IESG,
   Nomcom, and WG chairs), IETF employees and contractors, the RFC
   series and RFC editor, etc.

   The IETF Trust, documented in [RFC5378], and updated in
   [I-D.ietf-iasa2-trust-rationale] and [I-D.ietf-iasa2-trust-update],
   provides legal protection for the RFC series of documents and other
   aspects of the IETF.  This includes things such as protection for
   trademarks, copyrights, and intellectual property rights.  As part of
   the IETF Trust arrangement, IETF standards documents can be freely
   downloaded, copied, and distributed without financial or other
   distribution restrictions, though all rights to change these
   documents lie with the IETF.  The IETF Trust also provides legal
   protection in case of disputes over intellectual property rights and
   other rights.

7.  Financial and Administrative Relationship with ISOC

   Under the terms of the Operating Agreement between ISOC and the IETF,
   ISOC has agreed to provide some funding support for the IETF (ISOC
   has historically provided the IETF with significant financial
   support).  The IETF LLC will be responsible for creating and managing
   an annual operating budget for the IETF, for fund raising, for
   maintaining a bank account, and so on.  The IETF LLC is managed by a
   board of directors, one of whom is appointed by ISOC.  The intention
   is that ISOC and the IETF LLC operate at arms length.

   Under the new IASA 2.0 structure, the IETF is solely responsible for
   its administration via the IETF LLC, IETF Trust, IAB, IESG, IETF
   working groups, and other IETF processes.  A further exploration of
   this can be found in Section 4 of [I-D.ietf-iasa2-struct].
