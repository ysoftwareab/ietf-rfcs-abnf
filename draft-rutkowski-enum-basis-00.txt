    Abstract

    This document describes the development and basis of International
    Telephone Numbering as it has been manifested through the
    activities and formal instruments of the International
    Consultative Committee for Telephony (CCIF) and forums of the
    International Telecommunication Union (ITU).  The current
    practices for International Telephony Numbering are currently
    contained in a more general instrument, the International Public
    Telecommunication Numbering Plan, ITU-T Recommendation E.164
    (05/97).

    The historical record of this activity makes it clear that the
    basis for telephone numbering has always been that of autonomous
    sovereign nations and their international public telephony service
    providers cooperating among themselves to facilitate the routing of
    calls between their independent national telephony networks.  This
    historical record and basic instruments clearly contradict the
    notion of a simple authoritative numbering namespace hierarchy
    governed under the ITU and applied to all instantiations of
    telephone numbers, such as ENUM-based identifier services in either
    designated or competitive DNS zones provided using the RFC2916
    protocol.

1. Introduction

    The lack of available reference materials concerning the
    development and bases of International Telephone Numbering
    frequently results in orthogonal conceptualizations regarding the
    use of these numbers in resources manifested on private shared user
    networks that constitute the Internet.  In particular, the notions
    of root-based hierarchical delegations of authority of namespaces
    such as exist in DNS do not have an equivalent in the international
    activities or instruments concerning International Telephone
    Numbering.  This is relevant to the provisioning of ENUM
    services.


2. Scope

    This is an informational Internet Draft containing the historical
    record of instruments pertaining to the development and basis for
    International Telephony Numbering as it might apply to ENUM or any
    other Internet-based instantiation of those numbers.


3. Regional Origins (1945-1958)

    It appears that the idea of developing an international telephone
    numbering plan arose during the London meeting of the International
    Consultative Committee for Telephony (CCIF) in October 1945. [1]
    At the time, the CCIF was substantially focused on European
    telephony networks, and meeting at the end of World War II to
    modernize the facilities.  It adopted an "urgent" Question for the
    Sub-Commission on Methods of Rapid Operation, calling for the
    development of principles for what were known as "rapid telephone
    operations (manual, semi-automatic or automatic)." [2]  This
    subsequently took the form in 1949 of a several year collaborative
    effort to develop a plan for the interconnection of networks in
    Europe and the Mediterranean Basin. [3]

    When the CCIF met in Florence in 1951, it adopted the initial
    Recommendation of what subsequently became the International
    Telephony Numbering Plan.  It took the form of a set of principles,
    combined with the specification of the numbers and letters on a
    standard rotary telephone dial, which was an important predicate
    for any international plan to work. [4]  It also established what
    became the basic principle for all subsequent work, that each
    nation independently maintained for its own network a "national
    numbering plan," but cooperated in the development and
    implementation of those plans in such a way as to allow
    international calls. [5]   The work at this time proceeded under
    the aegis of Working Party 2/2 which dealt with matters of
    telephone Operating and Tariffs.

    This work culminated in 1954 with the adoption of a new version of
    the Recommendation establishing for the first time a Rec. 26bis,
    Numbering Plan for the International Semi-Automatic Telephone
    Service, complete with an associated List of International Codes
    for Routing. [6]  Two digit codes were indicated for all the
    countries in five regions: Western Europe, Northern Europe, Central
    Europe, Balkans and Oriental Europe, and Countries in the
    Mediterranean Basin. [7]  Interestingly, the CCIR also adopted a
    related recommendation explicitly eschewing a uniform access code
    since it "would be of use only to the small number of persons who,
    when travelling abroad would wish to dial a number (under fully
    automatic conditions) without the assistance of a local inhabitant
    of the country." [8]

    At the Special Assembly of the new integrated International
    Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT) in 1958,
    only relatively minor editorial changes were made to the
    Recommendation which was renumbered to become Rec. E.29, Directives
    for the Numbering of Subscribers' Lines and for the Routing of
    Automatic and Semi-Automatic International Working. [9]  At the
    same time, the codes were retitled Numerical List. [10]  It is
    worth noting the editorial changes in the language to emphasize the
    scope and purpose of the CCITT, leaving each country otherwise
    independent in "the preparation of a national numbering scheme for
    its own network." [11]


4. Global Development (1960-1992)

    In the late 1950s, developments in switching technology and
    submarine cable deployment led to an interest in developing a
    global "numbering scheme."  The CCITT IInd Plenary meeting - the
    first CCIT-CCIF-CCITT meeting outside Europe, at New Delhi in 1960
    - was the point of embarkation of these seminal developments.

    The European and Mediterranean Basin number scheme was not
    significantly changed at the New Delhi Plenary meeting, but it was
    issued as both Rec. E.29 and Q.11 to reflect the shared
    responsibility for its future development to the Telephone
    Signalling and Switching Study Group XI of CCITT. [12]  The Plenary
    established a Special Study Group B on the World-wide
    Semi-Automatic and Automatic Telephone Network, to "work out the
    programme of studies to be carried out by the other study groups
    whose co-operation it requires." [13]  SSG-B served as a means both
    for tasking the other study groups with certain studies, as well as
    aggregating the work done.

    The activity to develop a new international numbering scheme was
    specified in a new Question 2/XIII. [14]  Six significant annexes
    are attached to this Question from Netherlands, Germany, the Chile
    Telephony Company, Italy, Australia, and AT&T deal with the most
    important new development - the evolution of the existing numbering
    scheme from a regional to a global one.  A key feature of the
    transition involved the use of the first digit of the code to
    indicate a continent for traffic routing purposes. [15]  This
    primary problem with this approach was that a number of countries
    in the existing European and Mediterranean Basin countries would
    necessarily be required to shift their national code to another
    number.

    The 1964 CCITT Plenary Assembly adopted a revised Rec. E.29 (and
    Q.11) entitled Numbering for International Working with a List of
    Country Codes for International Semi-automatic and Automatic
    Service. [16]  Nine World Numbering Zones were designated: 1
    (integrated North American numbering plan); 2 (Africa); 3 & 4
    (Europe); 5 (Latin America); 6 (Australia and Pacific); 7 (USSR); 8
    (East Asia); 9 (Middle East and West Asia).  A combination of two
    and three digit codes necessarily were required.  Only seven
    European countries were able to retain their old codes.  Going
    forward, the Numbering Plan activity was shared among CCITT Study
    Groups II, XI, and the World Plan Committee.  The country code
    designators were chosen by national operator participants within
    the World Plan Committee.

    The 1968 CCITT Plenary Assembly redesignated the Recommendation to
    E.161 (retaining the Study Group XI copy as Q.11) and retitled the
    name to Numbering for International Service.  The list of codes was
    expanded to incorporate changes proposed by the World Plan
    Committee, Mexico City, 1967. [17]

    The 1972 CCITT Plenary Assembly kept the E.161 and Q.11
    designations, but changed the title to Numbering and Dialling
    Procedures for International Service. The list of codes was
    expanded to incorporate changes proposed by the World Plan
    Committee, Venice, 1971. [18]

    The 1977 CCITT Plenary Assembly kept the E.161 and Q.11
    designations and titles the same.  The list of codes was expanded
    to incorporate changes proposed by the World Plan Committee,
    Geneva, 1975. [19]

    The 1980 CCITT Plenary Assembly split the numbering recommendation
    into two parts - redesignating the numbering plan portion to E.163
    (also Q.11bis) and changed the title to Numbering Plan for the
    International Telephone Service.  The dial layout part was placed
    in E.161 and Q.11. The List was expanded to incorporate the changes
    proposed by the World Plan Committee, Paris 1980. [20]

    The 1984 CCITT Plenary Assembly kept the Recommendation designation
    and title the same, Rec. E.163, Numbering Plan for the
    International Telephone Service.  The list was expanded to
    incorporate the changed proposed by the World Plan Committee, 1984.
    [21]  The numbering plan also ended its dual existence as a Q.11
    Recommendation for signalling.

    The work on the CCITT's Integrated Services Digital Services (ISDN)
    network also enjoyed a level of development and visibility that
    resulted the 1984 Plenary adopting Rec. E.164, Numbering Plan for
    the ISDN Era. [22]  This Recommendation did not include the
    International Telephone Service at this time.

    The 1988 CCITT Plenary Assembly kept the Recommendation designation
    and title the same, Rec. E.163, Numbering Plan for the International
    Telephone Service.  The list was expanded to incorporate the changed
    proposed by the World Plan Committee, 1988.[23]  Rec. E.164,
    Numbering Plan for the ISDN Era was kept the same. [24]

    In 1991, CCITT Study Group 2 using a special adoption procedure
    - believing that ISDN would constitute the unifying global network
    concept - merged Rec. E.163, Numbering Plan for the International
    Telephone Service, into E.164, Numbering Plan for the ISDN Era. [25]


5. Contemporary ITU numbering developments (1993-)

    In 1993, the CCITT became the ITU Telecommunication Standardization
    Sector (ITU-T) and its Plenary Assemblies became World
    Telecommunication Standardization Conferences.  The first was held
    at Helsinki, 1-12 March 1993.  No changes to the telephone numbering
    plan were made.

    During the following years, however, International Telephony
    numbering began to treated more expansively in ITU Study Group 2.
    This new perspective - that included for the first time Internet
    developments - manifested themselves at the World Telecommunication
    Standardization Conference at Geneva in June 1996 (WTSA-96). [26]
    Of particular note were the pursuit of questions dealing with GII
    Numbering Requirements (Q20/2), and Impact of Private Networks on
    E.164 Resources (Q21/2). [27]

    Consonant with this new perspective concerning numbering, Rec.
    E.164 was characterized as "the foundation of numbering plans for
    the public switched network." [28]

    WTSC-96 was also notable for the first time describing numbering
    activities in terms of "international numbering resources."  This
    included included working on a new Rec. E.164.1 dealing with "the
    rules, criteria, and procedures for the assignment of Recommendation
    E.164 numbering resource."  [29]  The numbering activity also
    proceeded toward a less country-focussed and more flexible
    operator oriented administrative approach that has allowed for
    many innovative new international services to be offered.

    However, the use of the term "resources" for benign administrative
    reasons, could have unintended consequences in other ITU forums.
    The term's origins go back to the 1970s New World Economic Order
    (NWIO) political activities of the Non-Aligned Movement that
    methodically conceptualized radio spectrum, geostationary-satellite
    orbit positions, and other technical parameters as "resources"
    necessary to equitably apportion among all the nations of the world.
    The apportionment method typically included lengthy formal
    intergovernmental treaty conferences. [30]

    In late 1998, the ITU Plenipotentiary Conference (Minneapolis,
    1988) also advanced the "resources" movement by adopting Resolution
    102 characterizing Internet names and addresses as "global and
    essential resources." [31]  This complemented the previous
    treatment of radio spectrum and the geostationary-orbit as "limited
    natural resources." [32]  Although the Plenipotentiary Conference
    designated Internet private names and addresses outside their
    jurisdiction as "resources," they did not do so for the
    International Public Telephone numbers.

    Recommendation E.164 was retitled The International Public
    Telecommunication Numbering Plan in May 1997. [33]  Among other
    reasons, the title change also reflected in large measure the
    desire to move to a broader, non-ISDN based, conceptualization
    of numbering.

    The 1998 Plenipotentiary Conference also changed the name of the
    ITU-T's quadrennial plenary forums to World Telecommunication
    Standardization Assemblies.  [34]

    ITU-T also combined its GII and Internet Protocol-Based Network
    activities in late 1998 with the creation of an IP Coordination
    Team. [35]

    The WTSA-2000 met at Montreal, 27 Sep - 6 Oct 2000.  Especially
    notable was the adoption by ITU-T Study Group 2 of Question 1/2,
    Project number 11 dealing with Naming, Numbering, and Addressing
    for Interworking between E.164 and IP Address-Based Networks. [36]


6. Security Considerations

    Because International Telephone Numbering - the principal part
    of the ITU-T Rec. E.164 used for implementation of RFC2916 (ENUM)
    [37] - has emerged from the need to route switched circuit based
    calls between independent autonomous national public telephony
    networks, the providers of designated and competitive zone ENUM
    services [38] will likely need to deploy an array of methods to
    enhance DNS based telephone number zone trust.  This autonomy
    suggests the usefulness of common trust methods such as digital
    certificates to enhance flexible open market-driven provisioning
    of ENUM services.
