2.  Introduction

   CERNET2 is one of the China Next Generation Internet (CNGI)
   backbones.  The network design schemes of CERNET2, referring to
   overall architecture, backbone, core nodes, access networks and CNGI
   peer centers, are presented.  CERNET2 connects 25 core nodes
   distributed in 20 cities at speeds of 2.5-10 Gb/s.  The unique
   features of CERNET2 are:
   1.  Its backbones are IPv6-only networks (the biggest in the world),
       not the mixed IPv4/IPv6 infrastructure;
   2.  It provides a multi-vendor environment for the testing and trial
       operation of homemade IPv6 core routers in respects of
       interconnection, interworking and interoperation;
   3.  It is a testbed for NGI applications.

   CERNET plans to deploy a nationwide university Wireless LAN based
   Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] network deployment to support VoIP, Video
   Telephony, and other multi-media services.  In such a large scale and
   complicated network environment, it is crucial to guarantee quality
   of service to meet the requirements from end users.  Therefore the
   network handover process should be in control and the latency need to
   be minimized.

   There are variety of factors which will influence handover
   performance.  Thus currently there are several proposals related to
   improving handover performance which are already under the process of
   standardization. e.g.  Fast-handover [RFC4068], Hierarchical Mobile
   IPv6 [RFC4140], Detecting Network Attachment (DNA).[RFC4135]

   But access routers from different vendors are already deployed in
   CERNET network.  In order to support those technologies like Mobile
   IPv6 fast-handover, or DNA, those access routers must be upgraded.
   It is not feasible to upgrade all of those equipments.

   It is necessary to find a both economical and convinient scheme to
   solve this problem, and network controlled handover is such a
   potential solution.

3.  Network Controlled Handover

   This section outlines those problems which need to be considered by a
   network controlled handover solution.

3.1.  OAM

   As to operation and management, network controlled handover may be
   able to provider a convenient user management and operating interface
   to control the box/module which implements the network controlled
   function.  The failure discovery of such a box/module is required in
   the OAM interface.

3.2.  Administrating

   In order to satisfy the requirements from monitoring and accounting,
   network controlled handover should provide a proper mechanism for
   administrating.  User differentiation and priority control needs to
   be supported.

3.3.  Scalability

   Mobile IPv6 network will be deployed in CERNET which scales more than
   100 unversities, and each university will serve at least 5000 users.
   Also the network is growing continuously.

   Existing solutions will face crucial challenge in scalability.

3.4.  Simplicity

   Current solutions seams complicated to be widely deployed.
   Simplicity must be taken into consideration.  For example, network
   interaction and signaling must be simplified.

3.5.  Handover Delay

   Since network should be acceptable to typical services such as VoIP,
   it is preferable that Mobile IPv6 handover latency can be controlled
   within 500ms or less.

3.6.  Security

   In control plane, network-constrol box/module must support
   authentication, but an ISP may decide to turn it off in some
   circumstances. be able to authenticate its user.

   In data plane, the network and potential sulotion should support
   procotol can use IPsec procotol and an IPsec profile will have to be

   defined to protect its data.

3.7.  IPv4 Compatibility

   The co-existence of IPv6 and IPv4 is unavoidable.  It is expected
   that mobile IPv6 network should be compatible with IPv4 as much as
   possible.


4.  Security Considerations

   Under certain circumstances, it is expected that IPsec in Mobile IPv6
   protocol [RFC3776] can be disabled by certain user who have no
   requirement for security.

   IPsec security association SHOULD be able to transferred among access
   routers (thus [RFC4067] can be used), and IPsec security association
   transferring MUST be initiated by the network side, e.g. by router,
   and MUST not be initiated by the Mobile Node.
