Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information  Base  (MIB)
   for  use  with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing networks using Layer  2
   Tunneling Protocol.

   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both compliant to
   the  SNMPv2  SMI,  and  semantically  identical  to  the  peer  SNMPv1
   definitions.

1.0 Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information  Base  (MIB)
   for  use  with network management protocols in the Internet Community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects  used  for  managing  L2TP
   hosts.

2.0 The Network Management Framework

   The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of several
   components.  They are:

      RFC 1902 which defines the SMI v2, the mechanisms used for
          describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

      RFC 1903  which defines textual conventions used to enhance the
          clarity of object definitions.

      RFC 1156 which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects for
          the Internet suite of protocols.  STD 17/RFC 1213 defines
           MIB-II,  an  evolution  of  MIB-I  based   on   implementation
      experience
          and new operational requirements.

      STD 15/RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for
          network access to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined  for  the  purpose  of
   experimentation and evaluation.
