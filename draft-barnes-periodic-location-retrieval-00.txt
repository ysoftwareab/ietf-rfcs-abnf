Abstract

   The base HTTP Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) protocol includes
   options for retrieving location information from a LIS by a Device.
   Some networks require the ability for the device to periodically
   request location information from the LIS and/or for the LIS to
   periodically request location information from the device.
   Extensions to base HELD allow a Device to establish a context with a
   LIS and negotiate capabilities of the Device in terms of providing
   location information.  The measurement extensions to base HELD allow
   the LIS to request location information from a Device.  This document
   provides an overview of the requirements and a solution using HELD
   and HELD extensions to support the periodic request of location

Internet-Draft   Periodic Location Information Exchange     October 2008


1.  Introduction and Overview

   The retrieval of the location of a Device is information that is
   useful for a number of applications.  In addition, it is useful in
   some applications for a LIS to retrieve the location from a device.
   The L7 Location Configuration Protocol (LCP) problem statement and
   requirements document [I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps] provides some
   scenarios in which a Device might rely on its access network to
   provide location information.  The Location Information Server (LIS)
   service applies to access networks employing both wired technology
   (e.g.  DSL, Cable) and wireless technology (e.g.  WiMAX) with varying
   degrees of Device mobility.  This document describes the
   functionality for supporting periodic location retrievals required
   for wireless technologies such as WiMAX.  The functionality in this
   document is not specific to WiMAX and could be used by other
   technologies with similar requirements.

   The base HELD specification [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery]
   allows a Device to retrieve the location, either by value or
   reference, from a LIS.  The context extensions
   [I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-held-context] allow a device to manage its
   location on a LIS, by applying constraints, such as how long a
   location URI is valid, etc.  Including location measurements in a
   locationRequest message, as described in
   [I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements], allows a LIS to gather
   location information from a device in cases where the device has
   access to location information (e.g., via the access network or GPS),
   which is the case with many wireless technologies.  The capabilities
   negotiation extensions to the HELD context
   [I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-capabilities] allow a Device to communicate
   its ability to locate itself, along with providing specific
   measurement information in a response to a measurementRequest from
   the LIS.

   This document provides an overview of the requirements for
   periodicity of requesting location information both by a Device from
   an LIS and by the LIS from a Device depending upon the specific
   scenario and measurement capabilities of the Device.  The use of base
   HELD, along with the context extensions, location measurement
   extensions and the capabilities negotiations, to meet these
   requirements is detailed.


2.  Conventions & Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document uses the terms and references to terms defined in the
   base HELD protocol specification, the context extensions, capability
   negotiation extensions and measurement extensions.


3.  Device to LIS Periodicity

   The requirement for a Device to periodically request location
   information from a LIS is required for some applications and network
   environments, such as WiMAX.  The request for location information is
   either needed at a specific time interval or based on triggers such
   as device movement.  The following summarizes the requirements:

   [REQ-Dev-to-LIS-1]:  A Device requires the capability to request
      location information from a LIS at periodic intervals.
   [REQ-Dev-to-LIS-2]:  A Device requires the capability to request
      location information from a LIS based upon event triggers, such as
      Device movement.
   [REQ-Dev-to-LIS-3]:  The solution to support these requirements
      should consider existing IETF protocols to allow the Devices to
      operate in various network types.

   Using the Presence Information Data Format for Location Objects
   (PIDF-LO) [RFC4119], along with the extensions to PIDF-LO
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-pdif-lo-profile], is a potential solution to meet
   these requirements.  However, the frequency of updates to the
   presence information from the Device to the Network can negatively
   impact performance.  There are extensions to allow the throttling of
   the event notifications [I-D.niemi-sipping-event-throttle] that could
   minimize the impact.  However, for some Devices and Networks,
   presence is not required, thus the overhead of presence for this
   functionality is not desireable.

   It is possible that in the future or in the case of Devices that do
   support presence, a presence based solution may well be a good
   choice.  Requirements to allow more continuous updates of presence
   information are described in
   [I-D.thomson-simple-cont-presence-val-req] may well be applicable to
   supporting some of the requirements identified in this document.  An
   emphasis of these requirements is providing the watcher a means of
   control over the measurement process Thus, it is extremely beneficial
   for the proposed lightweight solution to make use of the base HELD
   protocol and extensions, since the location information is in the
   PIDF-LO format.  Thus, this solution is compatible with presence and
   can can support a broad range of scenarios and network types.

   The basic functionality to support the Device sending periodic
   locationRequest messages to the LIS can be accomplished with the

   current base HELD protocol by configuring the device with the
   periodicity for sending the locationRequest messages.  The specifics
   of the configuration mechanism are outside the scope of this
   document.  In addition, specific expiry times are included as part of
   the data in the locationResponse messages.  The Device should send
   another locationRequest message on or before the expiry time.

   For Devices that are made aware of location changes, the location
   change can be a trigger for the device to send another
   locationRequest message.

   The following diagram is an example of the basic message flow for
   supporting periodicity of Device requesting location information from
   a LIS, which requires no changes to base HELD.  In this example, the
   interval for the periodicity is set to be equal to the "expires"
   parameter for the locationURI returned in the locationResponse.  But,
   the basic message flow is independent of the source of the interval
   timer value for the Device or whether the request for location
   information from the LIS is triggered by an event.

4.  LIS to Device Periodic Location Requests

   In the cases where Devices have access to location information, such
   as via the access network or GPS, a LIS may need to request the
   location measurement information in order to support certain
   applications.  In some cases, the Location Recipient may have a
   locationURI, thus the LIS needs up-to-date measurement information
   for the Device at a specific instance in time.  In this case, the LIS
   cannot wait for the Device to send a periodic locationRequest message
   as desribed in Section 3.

   The periodicity of the requests by the LIS can be based on
   configuration information, periodic requests from the location based
   application that requires the location information, or capabilites
   exchanged - i.e., based on the types of location measurement
   information that may be provided, the LIS can determine a reasonable
   interval at which to request the location measurement information.

   [REQ-LIS-to-Dev-1]:  A LIS requires the capability to determine if a
      Device is capable of providing location measurement information.
   [REQ-LIS-to-Dev-2]:  A LIS requires the capability to request
      location measurement information from a Device based upon specific
      application periodicity requirements.
   [REQ-LIS-to-Dev-3]:  A self-locating Device should be able to
      communicate to the LIS that it can provide location measurement
      information to a LIS.
   [REQ-LIS-to-Dev-4]:  The solution to support these requirements
      should consider existing IETF protocols to allow the LIS to
      support Devices in a variety of access networks.

   To support the LIS to Device request for location measurement
   information, the Device must create a context, as described in
   [I-D.winterbottom-geopriv-held-context] to communicate to the LIS the
   capabilities it supports in terms of providing location
   measuresments.  [I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements] defines a
   broad range of common location-related measurement types, supporting
   a variety of access networks and geographic measurement modalities.
   The communication and exchange of these capabilities with the LIS via
   the contextRequest message requires that the LIS and Device both
   support the HELD device capabilility negotiation mechanisms as
   described in [I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-capabilities].

   The LIS can then either periodically or based on a trigger send a
   measurementRequest message to the Device, as defined in
   [I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-capabilities], to retrieve the location
   measurements.

   The following diagram summarizes the basic message flow for
   supporting periodicity of LIS requesting location measurement info
   from the Device.

       Figure 2: LIS to Device Periodic Location Measurement Request


5.  Additional Considerations and Potential Enhancements

   Some anticipated users of the functionality described in this
   document have identified more specific requirements.  This section
   discusses two of the requirements that have been discussed.  A
   description of how these requirements are addressed by base HELD and
   the extensions discussed in this document is provided.

5.1.  Specifying Interval for Periodic Location and Measurement Requests

   The Device to LIS periodic location requests requires no additional
   functionality beyond that provided by base HELD and the extensions as
   described in Section 3.  However, the approach has the limitation
   that the periodicity is controlled by the Device through
   configuration or event triggers, such as Device movement.  The
   periodicity is also inherently controlled by LIS with the "expires"
   parameter associated with a locationURI.  This provides the basic
   functionality, however, does not provide flexibility in terms of the
   LIS specifying the interval at which it would prefer the location
   requests be sent.

   Sending the Device capabilities when a context is established or
   updated allows the Device to communicate some of the characteristics
   of the functionality supported by the Device.  The LIS responds with
   the set of capabilities that it can use in the contextResponse
   message.  The intent of this capability negotiation is to provide the
   LIS with information so that it can request measurements from the
   Device.

   An additional requirement for the Device to be able to specify a
   desired expiry time has also been suggested.  To support this
   functionality, it may be possible to extend the capabilites by adding
   a URI that indicates the capability of the Device to support periodic
   requests for location from the LIS.  This would allow the LIS to
   decide whether it has the capacity to support these requests or
   whether it prefers to be in control and thus limit the periodicity of
   the Device requesting location based on the "expires" parameter
   associated with a specific locationURI, in the case that it does not
   support this capability.  In most cases, it is anticipated that since
   the LIS does have information as to the capabilities of a Device, it
   is more sensible to operate in this latter fashion.  However, due to
   the ability for a Device to update a context, it is possible that a
   Device may attempt to negotiate this capability after a certain
   period of time [TBD].  In order to control whether a Device would
   attempt to re-negotiate this capability an additional capability URI

   could be defined.  This might be useful, for example, when a LIS may
   be temporarily unable to support location requests at a higher
   frequency.  However, going beyond defining these URIs, additional
   functionality to support negotiating the rate at which the Device can
   send requests for location information isn't desireable.  The
   functionality would increase the dependency between the LIS and
   Device and the overhead for this functionality could be more than
   leaving the rate of the Device sending location requests to the LIS
   under control of the Device.

   That all said, since the capability negotiation mechanism is intended
   to provide sufficient information as to the types of measurements a
   LIS may request from the Device, with the LIS controlling the
   periodicity of the requests, it does not seem necessarily to add the
   additional URI for negotiating support of periodicity - i.e., support
   is inherent in the establishment of the context and the LIS has the
   knowledge as to the rate at which the location measurement
   information is required.

5.2.  Accuracy of Location Information

   The specification of the accuracy of location information has been
   discussed as a potential requirement in relation to the source of the
   location measurement information that is used by the LIS to determine
   location (e.g., GPS).  [I-D.thomson-geopriv-uncertainty] defines a
   general representation of Uncertainty and Confidence with respect to
   the location information in the PIDF-LO.  This methodology should be
   able to account for potential inaccuracies in location measurement
   information provided by the Device to the LIS, which the LIS uses as
   input for location determination, particularly since the context
   negotiation allows the LIS to communicate to the Device the types of
   location measurements that it supports or will be using for the
   specific context.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document makes use of the base HELD protocol and extensions,
   along with the security mechanisms specified for the protocol and

   extensions, thus no new security considerations are introduced.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any IANA registrations.  However, if
   it is decided to define additional capability URNs as discussed in
   Section 4, the appropriate registrations will be added to this
   section.
