    PCEP Extensions for Associating Working and Protection LSPs with
                              Stateful PCE
               draft-ietf-pce-stateful-path-protection-10

Abstract

   An active stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) is capable of
   computing as well as controlling via Path Computation Element
   Communication Protocol (PCEP) Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic
   Engineering Label Switched Paths (MPLS LSP).  Furthermore, it is also
   possible for an active stateful PCE to create, maintain, and delete
   LSPs.  This document defines the PCEP extension to associate two or
   more LSPs to provide end-to-end path protection.

Internet-Draft      Stateful PCE LSP Path Protection         August 2019


1.  Introduction

   [RFC5440] describes PCEP for communication between a Path Computation
   Client (PCC) and a PCE or between a pair of PCEs as per [RFC4655].  A
   PCE computes paths for MPLS-TE LSPs based on various constraints and
   optimization criteria.

   Stateful PCE [RFC8231] specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to
   enable stateful control of paths such as MPLS TE LSPs between and
   across PCEP sessions in compliance with [RFC4657].  It includes
   mechanisms to effect LSP state synchronization between PCCs and PCEs,
   delegation of control of LSPs to PCEs, and PCE control of timing and
   sequence of path computations within and across PCEP sessions and
   focuses on a model where LSPs are configured on the PCC and control
   over them is delegated to the PCE.  Furthermore, a mechanism to
   dynamically instantiate LSPs on a PCC based on the requests from a
   stateful PCE or a controller using stateful PCE, is specified in
   [RFC8281].

   Path protection [RFC4427] refers to a paradigm in which the working
   LSP is protected by one or more protection LSP(s).  When the working
   LSP fails, protection LSP(s) is/are activated.  When the working LSPs
   are computed and controlled by the PCE, there is benefit in a mode of
   operation where protection LSPs are as well.  [RFC8051] describes
   applicability of path protection in PCE deployments.

   This document specifies a stateful PCEP extension to associate two or
   more LSPs for the purpose of setting up path protection.  The
   proposed extension covers the following scenarios:

   o  A PCC initiates a protection LSP and retains the control of the
      LSP.  The PCC computes the path itself or makes a request for path
      computation to a PCE.  After the path setup, it reports the
      information and state of the path to the PCE.  This includes the
      association group identifying the working and protection LSPs.
      This is the passive stateful mode [RFC8051].

   o  A PCC initiates a protection LSP and delegates the control of the
      LSP to a stateful PCE.  During delegation the association group
      identifying the working and protection LSPs is included.  The PCE
      computes the path for the protection LSP and update the PCC with
      the information about the path as long as it controls the LSP.
      This is the active stateful mode [RFC8051].

   o  A protection LSP could be initiated by a stateful PCE, which
      retains the control of the LSP.  The PCE is responsible for
      computing the path of the LSP and updating to the PCC with the

      information about the path.  This is the PCE-Initiated mode
      [RFC8281].

   Note that protection LSP can be established (signaled) prior to the
   failure (in which case the LSP is said to be in standby mode
   [RFC4427] or a Primary LSP [RFC4872]) or post failure of the
   corresponding working LSP according to the operator choice/policy
   (known as secondary LSP [RFC4872]).

   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] introduces a generic mechanism to
   create a grouping of LSPs which can then be used to define
   associations between a set of LSPs that is equally applicable to
   stateful PCE (active and passive modes) and stateless PCE.

   This document specifies a PCEP extension to associate one working LSP
   with one or more protection LSPs using the generic association
   mechanism.

   This document describes a PCEP extension to associate protection LSPs
   by creating Path Protection Association Group (PPAG) and encoding
   this association in PCEP messages for stateful PCEP sessions.

3.  PCEP Extensions

3.1.  Path Protection Association Type

   LSPs are not associated by listing the other LSPs with which they
   interact, but rather by making them belong to an association group
   referred to as "Path Protection Association Group" (PPAG) in this
   document.  All LSPs join a PPAG individually.  PPAG is based on the
   generic Association object used to associate two or more LSPs
   specified in [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group].  A member of a PPAG
   can take the role of working or protection LSP.  This document
   defines a new Association type called "Path Protection Association
   Type" of value TBD1.  A PPAG can have one working LSP and/or one or
   more protection LSPs.  The source, destination and Tunnel ID (as
   carried in LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV [RFC8231], with description as per
   [RFC3209]) of all LSPs within a PPAG MUST be the same.  As per
   [RFC3209], TE tunnel is used to associate a set of LSPs during
   reroute or to spread a traffic trunk over multiple paths.

   The format of the Association object used for PPAG is specified in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group].

   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] specifies the mechanism for the
   capability advertisement of the Association types supported by a PCEP
   speaker by defining a ASSOC-Type-List TLV to be carried within an
   OPEN object.  This capability exchange for the Association type
   described in this document (i.e.  Path Protection Association Type)
   MAY be done before using the policy association, i.e., the PCEP
   speaker MAY include the Path Protection Association Type (TBD1) in
   the ASSOC-Type-List TLV before using the PPAG in the PCEP messages.

   This Association type is dynamic in nature and created by the PCC or
   PCE for the LSPs belonging to the same TE tunnel (as described in
   [RFC3209]) originating at the same head node and terminating at the
   same destination.  These associations are conveyed via PCEP messages
   to the PCEP peer.  As per [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group], the
   association source is set to the local PCEP speaker address that
   created the association, unless local policy dictates otherwise.
   Operator-configured Association Range MUST NOT be set for this
   Association type and MUST be ignored.

3.2.  Path Protection Association TLV

   The Path Protection Association TLV is an optional TLV for use with
   the Path Protection Association Type.  The Path Protection
   Association TLV MUST NOT be present more than once.  If it appears
   more than once, only the first occurrence is processed and any others
   MUST be ignored.

Internet-Draft      Stateful PCE LSP Path Protection         August 2019


   The Path Protection Association TLV follows the PCEP TLV format of
   [RFC5440].

   The type (16 bits) of the TLV is TBD2.  The length field (16 bit) has
   a fixed value of 4.

   The value comprises of a single field, the Path Protection
   Association Flags (32 bits), where each bit represents a flag option.

   The format of the Path Protection Association TLV (Figure 1) is as
   follows:

     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |         Type = TBD2         |              Length = 4         |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |   PT      |               Unassigned Flags                |S|P|
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


             Figure 1: Path Protection Association TLV format

   Path Protection Association Flags (32 bits) - The following flags are
   currently defined -

      Protecting (P): 1 bit - This bit is as defined in Section 14.1 of
      [RFC4872] to indicate if the LSP is working or protection LSP.

      Secondary (S): 1 bit - This bit is as defined in Section 14.1 of
      [RFC4872] to indicate if the LSP is primary or secondary LSP.  The
      S flag is ignored if the P flag is not set.

      Protection Type (PT): 6 bits - This field is as defined in
      Section 14.1 of [RFC4872] to indicate the LSP protection type in
      use.

      Unassigned bits are considered reserved.  They MUST be set to 0 on
      transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.

   If the TLV is missing, it is considered that the LSP is the working
   LSP (i.e. as if P bit is unset).

4.  Operation

   An LSP is associated with other LSPs with which they interact by
   adding them to a common association group via the ASSOCIATION object.

Internet-Draft      Stateful PCE LSP Path Protection         August 2019


   All procedures and error-handling for the ASSOCIATION object is as
   per [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group].

4.1.  State Synchronization

   During state synchronization, a PCC reports all the existing LSP
   states as described in [RFC8231].  The association group membership
   pertaining to an LSP is also reported as per
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group].  This includes PPAGs.

4.2.  PCC-Initiated LSPs

   A PCC can associate a set of LSPs under its control for path
   protection purpose.  Similarly, the PCC can remove one or more LSPs
   under its control from the corresponding PPAG.  In both cases, the
   PCC reports the change in association to PCE(s) via Path Computation
   Report (PCRpt) message.  A PCC can also delegate the working and
   protection LSPs to an active stateful PCE, where the PCE would
   control the LSPs.  The stateful PCE could update the paths and
   attributes of the LSPs in the association group via Path Computation
   Update (PCUpd) message.  A PCE could also update the association to
   the PCC via PCUpd message.  These procedures are described in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group].

   It is expected that both working and protection LSP are delegated
   together (and to the same PCE) to avoid any race conditions.  Refer
   to [I-D.litkowski-pce-state-sync] for the problem description.

4.3.  PCE-Initiated LSPs

   A PCE can create/update working and protection LSPs independently.
   As specified in [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group], Association Groups
   can be created by both the PCE and the PCC.  Further, a PCE can
   remove a protection LSP from a PPAG as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group].  The PCE uses PCUpd or Path
   Computation Initiate (PCInitiate) messages to communicate the
   association information to the PCC.

4.4.  Session Termination

   As per [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] the association information
   is cleared along with the LSP state information.  When a PCEP session
   is terminated, after expiry of State Timeout Interval at the PCC, the
   LSP state associated with that PCEP session is reverted to operator-
   defined default parameters or behaviors as per [RFC8231].  The same
   procedure is also followed for the association information.  On
   session termination at the PCE, when the LSP state reported by PCC is
   cleared, the association information is also cleared as per

Internet-Draft      Stateful PCE LSP Path Protection         August 2019


   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group].  Where there are no LSPs in a
   association group, the association is considered to be deleted.

4.5.  Error Handling

   As per the processing rules specified in section 5.4 of
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group], if a PCEP speaker does not support
   this Path Protection Association Type, it would return a PCErr
   message with Error-Type 26 "Association Error" and Error-Value 1
   "Association type is not supported".

   All LSPs (working or protection) within a PPAG MUST belong to the
   same TE Tunnel (as described in [RFC3209]) and have the same source
   and destination.  If a PCEP speaker attempts to add an LSP to a PPAG
   and the Tunnel ID (as carried in LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV [RFC8231], with
   description as per [RFC3209]) or source or destination of the LSP is
   different from the LSP(s) in the PPAG, the PCC MUST send PCErr with
   Error-Type 26 (Association Error) [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group]
   and Error-Value TBD3 (Tunnel ID or End points mismatch for Path
   Protection Association).  In case of Path Protection, LSP-IDENTIFIERS
   TLV SHOULD be included for all LSPs (including Segment Routing (SR)
   [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing]).

   When the PCEP peer does not support the protection type set in PPAG,
   the PCEP peer MUST send PCErr with Error-Type 26 (Association Error)
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] and Error-Value TBD5 (Protection
   type is not supported).

   A given LSP MAY belong to more than one PPAG.  If there is a conflict
   between any of the two PPAGs, the PCEP peer MUST send PCErr with
   Error-Type 26 (Association Error) [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group]
   and Error-Value 6 (Association information mismatch) as per
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group].

   When the protection type is set to 1+1 or 1:N with N=1, there MUST be
   only one working LSP and one protection LSP within a PPAG.  If a PCEP
   speaker attempts to add another working/protection LSP, the PCEP peer
   MUST send PCErr with Error-Type 26 (Association Error)
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] and Error-Value TBD4 (Attempt to add
   another working/protection LSP for Path Protection Association).

   When the protection type is set to 1:N with N>1, there MUST be only
   one working LSP and number of protection LSPs MUST NOT be more than N
   within a PPAG.  If a PCEP speaker attempts to add another working/
   protection LSP, the PCEP peer MUST send PCErr with Error-Type 26
   (Association Error) [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] and Error-Value
   TBD4 (Attempt to add another working/protection LSP for Path
   Protection Association).

Internet-Draft      Stateful PCE LSP Path Protection         August 2019


   All processing as per [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] continues to
   apply.

5.  Other Considerations

   The working and protection LSPs are typically resource disjoint
   (e.g., node, SRLG disjoint).  This ensures that a single failure will
   not affect both the working and protection LSPs.  The disjoint
   requirement for a group of LSPs is handled via another Association
   type called "Disjointness Association", as described in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-diversity].  The diversity requirements for
   the protection LSP are also handled by including both ASSOCIATION
   objects identifying both the protection association group and the
   disjoint association group for the group of LSPs.

   [RFC4872] introduces the concept and mechanisms to support the
   association of one LSP to another LSP across different RSVP - Traffic
   Engineering (RSVP-TE) sessions using ASSOCIATION and PROTECTION
   object.  The information in the PPAG TLV in PCEP as received from the
   PCE, is used to trigger the signalling of working LSP and protection
   LSP, with the Path Protection Association Flags mapped to the
   corresponding fields in the PROTECTION Object in RSVP-TE.

6.  IANA Considerations

   [Note to RFC Editor and IANA: Sections 3.1, 3.2, and 4.5 contain
   "TBD1" through "TBD5" those should be replaced by the values that
   IANA assigns.]

6.1.  Association Type

   This document defines a new Association type, originally defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group], for path protection.  IANA is
   requested to make the assignment of a new value for the sub-registry
   "ASSOCIATION Type Field" (request to be created in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group]), as follows:

   +----------------------+-------------------------+------------------+
   | Association type     | Association Name        | Reference        |
   | Value                |                         |                  |
   +----------------------+-------------------------+------------------+
   | TBD1                 | Path Protection         | This             |

6.2.  PPAG TLV

   This document defines a new TLV for carrying additional information
   of LSPs within a path protection association group.  IANA is
   requested to make the assignment of a new value for the existing
   "PCEP TLV Type Indicators" registry as follows:

   +---------------+-----------------------------------+---------------+
   | TLV Type      | TLV Name                          | Reference     |
   | Value         |                                   |               |

   +---------------+-----------------------------------+---------------+

   This document requests that a new sub-registry, named "Path
   protection Association Group TLV Flag Field", is created within the
   "Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers" registry to manage
   the Flag field in the Path Protection Association Group TLV.  New
   values are to be assigned by Standards Action [RFC8126].  Each bit
   should be tracked with the following qualities:

   o  Bit number (count from 0 as the most significant bit)

   o  Name flag

   o  Reference

          +------------+-----------------------+----------------+
          | Bit Number |          Name         |   Reference    |

6.3.  PCEP Errors

   This document defines new Error-Values related to path protection
   association for Error-type 26 "Association Error" defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group].  IANA is requested to allocate new
   error values within the "PCEP-ERROR Object Error Types and Values"
   sub-registry of the PCEP Numbers registry, as follows:

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations described in [RFC8231], [RFC8281], and
   [RFC5440] apply to the extensions described in this document as well.
   Additional considerations related to associations where a malicious
   PCEP speaker could be spoofed and could be used as an attack vector
   by creating associations as described in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group].  Adding a spurious protection LSP
   to the Path Protection Association group could give false sense of
   network reliability, which leads to issues when the working LSP is
   down and the protection LSP fails as well.  Thus securing the PCEP
   session using Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC8253], as per the
   recommendations and best current practices in [RFC7525], is
   RECOMMENDED.

8.  Manageability Considerations

8.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any control or
   policy requirements in addition to those already listed in [RFC5440],
   [RFC8231], and [RFC8281].

8.2.  Information and Data Models

   [RFC7420] describes the PCEP MIB, there are no new MIB Objects for
   this document.

   The PCEP YANG module [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-yang] supports associations.

8.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new liveness
   detection and monitoring requirements in addition to those already
   listed in [RFC5440], [RFC8231], and [RFC8281].

8.4.  Verify Correct Operations

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new operation
   verification requirements in addition to those already listed in
   [RFC5440], [RFC8231], and [RFC8281].

8.5.  Requirements On Other Protocols

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new requirements
   on other protocols.

8.6.  Impact On Network Operations

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not have any impact on network
   operations in addition to those already listed in [RFC5440],
   [RFC8231], and [RFC8281].
