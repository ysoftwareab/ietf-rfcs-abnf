              Processing of the Hop-by-Hop Options Header
                        draft-peng-v6ops-hbh-06

Abstract

   This document describes the processing of the Hop-by-Hop Options
   Header (HBH) in today's routers in the aspects of standards
   specification, common implementations, and default operations.  This
   document outlines the reasons why the Hop-by-Hop Options Header is
   rarely utilized in current networks.  In addition, this document
   describes how the HBH could be used as a powerful mechanism allowing
   deployment and operations of new services requiring a more optimized
   way to leverage network resources of an infrastructure.  The Hop-by-
   Hop Options Header is taken into consideration by several network
   operators as a valuable container for carrying the information
   facilitating the introduction of new services.  The processing
   requirments of the HBH and the migration strategies are also
   suggested.

1.  Introduction

   Due to historical reasons, such as incapable ASICs, limited IPv6
   deployments, and few service requirements, the most common Hop-by-Hop
   Options header (HBH) processing implementation is that the node sends
   the IPv6 packets with the Hop-by-Hop Options header to the control
   plane of the node.  The option type of each option carried within the
   Hop-by-Hop Options header will not even be examined before the packet
   is sent to the control plane.  Very often, such processing behavior
   is the default configuration or, even worse, is the only behavior of
   the ipv6 implementation of the node.

   Such default processing behavior of the Hop-by-Hop Options header
   could result in various unpleasant effects such as a risk of Denial
   of Service (DoS) attack on the router control plane and inconsistent
   packet drops due to rate limiting on the interface between the router
   control plane and forwarding plane, which will impact the normal end-
   to-end IP forwarding of the network services.

   This actually introduced a circular problem:

   -> An implementation problem caused HBH to become a DoS vector.

   -> Because HBH is a DoS vector, network operators deployed ACLs that
   discard packets containing HBH.

   -> Because network operators deployed ACLs that discard packets
   containing HBH, network designers stopped defining new HBH Options.

   -> Because network designers stopped defining new HBH Options, the
   community was not motivated to fix the implementation problem that
   cause HBH to become a DoS vector.

   The purpose of this draft is to break the cycle described above,
   fixing the problem that caused HBH not actually being utilized in
   operators' networks so to allow a better leverage of the HBH
   capability.

   Driven by the wide deployments of IPv6 and ever-emerging new
   services, the Hop-by-Hop Options Header is taken as a valuable
   container for carrying the information to facilitate these new
   services.

   This document suggests the desired processing behavior and the
   migration strategies towards it.

2.  Modern Router Architecture

   Modern router architecture design maintains a strict separation of
   the router control plane and its forwarding plane [RFC6192], as shown
   in Figure 1.  Either the control plane or the forwarding plane is
   composed of both software and hardware, but each plane is responsible
   for different functions.

                                +----------------+
                                | Router Control |
                                |     Plane      |
                                +------+-+-------+

                                +------+-+-------+

                        Figure 1. Modern Router Architecture

   The router control plane supports routing and management functions,
   handling packets destined to the device as well as building and
   sending packets originated locally on the device, and also drives the
   programming of the forwarding plane.  The router control plane is
   generally realized in software on general-purpose processors, and its
   hardware is usually not optimized for high-speed packet handling.
   Because of the wide range of functionality, it is more susceptible to
   security vulnerabilities and a more likely a target for a DoS attack.

   The forwarding plane is typically responsible for receiving a packet
   on an incoming interface, performing a lookup to identify the
   packet's next hop and determine the outgoing interface towards the
   destination, and forwarding the packet out through the appropriate
   outgoing interface.  Typically, forwarding plane functionality is
   realized in high-performance Application Specific Integrated Circuits
   (ASICs) or Network Processors (NPs) that are capable of handling very
   high packet rates.

   The router control plane interfaces with its forwarding plane through
   the Interface Z, as shown in the Figure 1, and the forwarding plane
   connects to other network devices via Interfaces such as X and Y.
   Since the router control plane is vulnerable to the DoS attack,
   usually a traffic filtering mechanism is implemented on Interface Z
   in order to block unwanted traffic.  In order to protect the router
   control plane, a rate-limiting mechanism is always implemented on
   this interface.  However, such rate limiting mechanism will always
   cause inconsistent packet drops, which will impact the normal IP
   forwarding.

   Semiconductor chip technology has advanced significantly in the last
   decade, and as such the widely used network processing and forwarding
   process can now not only forward packets at line speed, but also
   easily support other feature processing such as QoS for DiffServ/
   MPLS, Access Control List (ACL), Firewall, and Deep Packet Inspection
   (DPI).

   A Network Processing Unit (NPU) is a non-ASIC based Integrated
   Circuit (IC) that is programmable through software.  It performs all
   packet header operations between the physical layer interface and the
   switching fabric such as packet parsing and forwarding, modification,
   and forwarding.  Many equipment vendors implement these functions in
   fixed function ASICs rather than using "off-the-shelf" NPUs, because
   of proprietary algorithms.

   Classification Co-processor is a specialized processor that can be
   used to lighten the processing load on an NPU by handling the parsing
   and classification of incoming packets such as IPv6 extended header
   HBH options processing.  This advancement enables network processors
   to do the general process to handle simple control messages for
   traffic management, such as signaling for hardware programming,
   congestion state report, OAM, etc.  Industry trend is for intelligent
   multi-core CPU hardware using modern NPUs for forwarding packets at
   line rate while still being able to perform other complex tasks such
   as HBH forwarding options processing without having to punt to the
   control plane.

   Many of the packet-processing devices employed in modern switch and
   router designs are fixed-function ASICs to handle proprietary
   functions.  While these devices can be very efficient for the set of
   functions they are designed for, they can be very inflexible.  There
   is a tradeoff of price, performance and flexibility when vendors make
   a choice to use a fixed function ASIC as opposed to NPU.  Due to the
   inflexibility of the fixed function ASIC, tasks that require
   additional processing such as IPv6 HBH header processing must be
   punted to the control plane.  This problem is still a challenge today
   and is the reason why operators to protect against control plane DOS

   attack vector must drop or ignore HBH options.  As industry shifts to
   Merchant Silicon based NPU evolution from fixed function ASIC, the
   gap will continue to close increasing the viability ubiquitous HBH
   use cases due to now processing in the forwarding plane.

   Most modern routers maintain a strict separation between forwarding
   plane and control plane hardware.  Forwarding plane bandwidth and
   resources are plentiful, while control plane bandwidth and resources
   are constrained.  In order to protect scarce control plane resources,
   routers enforce policies that restrict access from the forwarding
   plane to the control plane.  Effective policies address packets
   containing the HBH Options Extension header, because HBH control
   options require access from the forwarding plane to the control
   plane.  Many network operators perceive HBH Options to be a breach of
   the separation between the forwarding and control planes.  In this
   case HBH control options would be required to be punted to control
   plane by fixed function ASICs as well as NPUs.

   The maximum length of an HBH Options header is 2,048 bytes.  A source
   node can encode hundreds of options in 2,048 bytes.  With today's
   technology it would be cost prohibitive to be able to process
   hundreds of options with either NPU or proprietary fixed function
   ASIC.

   While [RFC8200] required that all nodes must examine and process the
   Hop-by-Hop Options header, it is now expected that nodes along a
   packet's delivery path only examine and process the Hop-by-Hop
   Options header if explicitly configured to do so.  This can be
   beneficial in cases where transit nodes are legacy hardware and the
   destination endpoint PE is newer NPU based hardware that can process
   HBH in the forwarding plane.

   IPv6 Extended Header limitations that need to be addressed to make
   HBH processing more efficient and viable in the forwarding plane:

   [RFC8504] defines the IPv6 node requirements and how to protect a
   node from excessive header chain and excessive header options with
   various limitations that can be defined on a node.  [RFC8883] defines
   ICMPv6 Errors for discarding packets due to processing limits.  Per
   [RFC8200] HBH options must be processed serially.  However, an
   implementation of options processing can be made to be done with more
   parallelism in serial processing grouping of similar options to be
   processed in parallel.

   The IPv6 standard does not currently limit the header chain length or
   number of options that can be encoded.

   Each Option is encoded in a TLV and so processing of a long list of
   TLVs is expensive.  Zero data length encoded options TLVs are a valid
   option.  A DOS vector could be easily generated by encoding 1000 HBH
   options (Zero data length) in a standard 1500 MTU packet.  So now
   imagine if you have a Christmas tree long header chain to parse each
   with many options.

3.  Specification of RFC 8200

   [RFC8200] defines several IPv6 extension header types, including the
   Hop-by-Hop (HBH) Options header.  As specified in [RFC8200], the Hop-
   by-Hop (HBH) Options header is used to carry optional information
   that will be examined and processed by every node along a packet's
   delivery path, and it is identified by a Next Header value of zero in
   the IPv6 header.

   The Hop-by-Hop (HBH) Options header contains the following fields:

   -- Next Header: 8-bit selector, identifies the type of header
   immediately following the Hop-by-Hop Options header.

   -- Hdr Ext Len: 8-bit unsigned integer, the length of the Hop-by-Hop
   Options header in 8-octet units, not including the first 8 octets.

   -- Options: Variable-length field, of length such that the complete
   Hop-by-Hop Options header is an integer multiple of 8 octets long.

   The Hop-by-Hop (HBH) Options header carries a variable number of
   "options" that are encoded in the format of type-length-value (TLV).

   The highest-order two bits (i.e., the ACT bits) of the Option Type
   specify the action that must be taken if the processing IPv6 node
   does not recognize the Option Type.  The third-highest-order bit
   (i.e., the CHG bit) of the Option Type specifies whether or not the
   Option Data of that option can change en route to the packet's final
   destination.

   While [RFC2460] required that all nodes must examine and process the
   Hop-by-Hop Options header, with [RFC8200] it is expected that nodes
   along a packet's delivery path only examine and process the Hop-by-
   Hop Options header if explicitly configured to do so.  It means that
   the HBH processing behavior in a node depends on its configuration.









Peng, et al.            Expires 24 February 2022                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft           Processing HBH Opt Hdr              August 2021


   However, in the current [RFC8200], there is no explicit specification
   of the possible configurations.  Therefore, the nodes may be
   configured to ignore the Hop-by-Hop Options header, drop packets
   containing a Hop-by-Hop Options header, or assign packets containing
   a Hop-by-Hop Options header to the control plane [RFC8200].  Because
   of these likely uncertain processing behaviors, new hop-by-hop
   options are not recommended.

4.  Common Implementations

   In the current common implementations, once an IPv6 packet, with its
   Next Header field set to 0, arrives at a node, it will be directly
   sent to the control plane of the node.  With such implementations,
   the value of the Next Header field in the IPv6 header is the only
   trigger for the default processing behavior.  The option type of each
   option carried within the Hop-by-Hop Options header will not even be
   examined before the packet is sent to the control plane.

   Very often, such processing behavior is the default configuration on
   the node, which is embedded in the implementation and cannot be
   changed or reconfigured.

   Another critical component of IPv6 HBH processing, in some cases
   overlooked, is the operator core network which can be designed to use
   the global Internet routing table for internet traffic and in other
   cases use an overlay MPLS VPN to carry Internet traffic.

   In the global Internet routing table scenario where only an underlay
   global routing table exists, and no VPN overlay carrying customer
   Internet traffic, the IPv6 HBH options can be used as a DOS attack
   vector for both the operator nodes, adjacent inter-as peer nodes as
   well as customer nodes along a path.

   In a case where the Internet routing table is carried in a MPLS VPN
   overlay payload, the HBH options header does not impact the operator
   underlay framework and only impacts the VPN overlay payload and thus
   the operator underlay topmost label global table routing FEC LSP
   instantiation is not impacted as the operator underlay is within the
   operators closed domain.

   However, HBH options DOS attack vector in the VPN overlay can still
   impact the customer CE destination end nodes as well as other
   adjacent inter-as operators that only use underlay global Internet
   routing table.  In an operator closed domain where MPLS VPN overlay
   is utilized to carry internet traffic, the operator has full control
   of the underlay and IPv6 Extended header chain length as well as the
   number of HBH options encoded.

Internet-Draft           Processing HBH Opt Hdr              August 2021


   In the global routing table scenario for Internet traffic there is no
   way to control the IPv6 Extended header chain lenghth as well as the
   number of HBH options encoded.

4.1.  Historical Reasons

   When IPv6 was first implemented on high-speed routers, HBH options
   were not yet well-understood and ASICs were not as capable as they
   are today.  So, early IPv6 implementations dispatched all packets
   that contain HBH options to their control plane.

4.2.  Consequences

   Such implementation introduces a risk of a DoS attack on the control
   plane of the node, and a large flow of IPv6 packets could congest the
   control plane, causing other critical functions (including routing
   and network management) that are executed on the control plane to
   fail.  Rate limiting mechanisms will cause inconsistent packet drops
   and impact the normal end-to-end IP forwarding of the network
   services.

5.  Operators' Typical Processing

   To mitigate this DoS vulnerability, many operators deployed Access
   Control Lists (ACLs) that discard all packets containing HBH Options.

   [RFC6564] shows the Reports from the field indicating that some IP
   routers deployed within the global Internet are configured either to
   ignore or to drop packets having a hop-by-hop header.  As stated in
   [RFC7872], many network operators perceive HBH Options to be a breach
   of the separation between the forwarding and control planes.
   Therefore, several network operators configured their nodes so as to
   discard all packets containing the HBH Options Extension Header,
   while others configured nodes to forward the packet but to ignore the
   HBH Options.  [RFC7045] also states that hop-by-hop options are not
   handled by many high-speed routers or are processed only on a control
   plane.

   Due to such behaviors observed and described in these specifications,
   new hop-by-hop options are not recommended in [RFC8200] hence the
   usability of HBH options is severely limited.

6.  New Services

   As IPv6 is being rapidly and widely deployed worldwide, more and more
   applications and network services are migrating to or directly
   adopting IPv6.  More and more new services that require HBH are
   emerging and the HBH Options header is going to be utilized by the
   new services in various scenarios.

   In-situ OAM (IOAM) with IPv6 encapsulation
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-ipv6-options] is one of the examples.  IOAM in
   IPv6 is used to enhance diagnostics of IPv6 networks and complements
   other mechanisms, such as the IPv6 Performance and Diagnostic Metrics
   Destination Option described in [RFC8250].  The IOAM data fields are
   encapsulated in "option data" fields of the Hop-by-Hop Options header
   if Pre-allocated Tracing Option, Incremental Tracing Option, or Proof
   of Transit Option are carried [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data], that is, the
   IOAM performs per hop.

   Alternate Marking Method can be used as the passive performance
   measurement tool in an IPv6 domain.  The AltMark Option is defined as
   a new IPv6 extension header option to encode alternate marking
   technique and Hop-by-Hop Options Header is considered
   [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-alt-mark].

   The Minimum Path MTU Hop-by-Hop Option is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-6man-mtu-option] to record the minimum Path MTU along the
   forward path between a source host to a destination host.  This Hop-
   by-Hop option is intended to be used in environments like Data
   Centers and on paths between Data Centers as well as other
   environments including the general Internet.  It provides a useful
   tool for allowing to better take advantage of paths able to support a
   large Path MTU.

   As more services start utilizing the HBH Options header, more packets
   containing HBH Options are going to be injected into the networks.
   According to the current common configuration in most network
   deployments, all the packets of the new services are going to be sent
   to the control plane of the nodes, with the possible consequence of
   causing a DoS on the control plane.  The packets will be dropped and
   the normal IP forwarding may be severely impacted.  The deployment of
   new network services involving multi-vendor interoperability will
   become impossible.

7.  Requirements

   *  The HBH options header MUST NOT become a possible DDoS Vector.





Peng, et al.            Expires 24 February 2022               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft           Processing HBH Opt Hdr              August 2021


   *  HBH options SHOULD be designed so that they don't reduce the
      probability of packet delivery.  For example, an intermediate node
      may discard a packet because it contains more HBH options than the
      node can process.

   *  HBH processing MUST be efficient.  That is, it MUST be possible to
      produce implementations that perform well at a reasonable cost.

   *  The Router Alert Option MUST NOT impact the processing of other
      HBH options that should be processed more quickly.

   *  HBH Options MAY influence how a packet is forwarded.  However,
      with the exception of the Router Alert Option, an HBH Option MUST
      NOT cause control plane state to be created, modified or destroyed
      on the processing node.  As per [RFC6398], protocol developers
      SHOULD avoid future use of the Router Alert Option.

   *  More requirements are to be added.

8.  Migration Strategies

   In order to achieve the desired processing behavior of the HBH
   options header and facilitate the ever-emerging new services to be
   deployed in operators' networks across multiple vendors' devices, the
   migration can happen in three parts as described below:

   1.  The source of the HBH options header encapsulation.

   The information to be carried in the HBH options header needs to be
   first categorized and encapsulated into either control options or
   forwarding options, and then encapsulated in different packets.

   2.  The nodes within the network.

   The nodes within the network are updated to the proposed behavior
   introduced in the previous section.

   3.  The edge nodes of the network.

   The edge nodes should check whether the packet contains an HBH header
   with control or forwarding option.  Packets with a control option may
   still be filtered and dropped while packets with forwarding option
   SHOULD be allowed by the ACL.

   If it is certain that there is no harm that can be introduced by the
   HBH control options to the nodes and the services, they can also be
   allowed.

   Note: During the migration stage, the nodes that are not yet updated
   will stay with their existing configurations.

9.  Security Considerations

   The same as the Security Considerations apply as in [RFC8200] for the
   part related with the HBH Options header.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not include an IANA request.
