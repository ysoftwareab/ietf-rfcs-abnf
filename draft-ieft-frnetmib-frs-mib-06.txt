Internet Draft          Frame Relay Service MIB                June 1999


1.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        RFC 1155 [2], RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The second version,
        called SMIv2, is described in RFC 2578 [5], RFC 2579 [6] and RFC
        2580 [7].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message
        protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
        called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
        The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and
        described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations
        and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and
        the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
        [15].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [16].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine

   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

2.  Changes from RFC 1604

   The changes from RFC 1604 are the following:

        (1)  This MIB works for switches too.  Read-writable
             versions of a number of frLport and frVCSig objects
             were created to allow this.

        (2)  frPVCEndptInDiscards was clarified.  Congestion
             discards are not counted.

        (3)  Descriptions were added for the values of
             frPVCEndptRcvdSigStatus.

        (4)  An additional instance of frPVCEndptRcvdSigStatus was
             added to the Connect Status Change Trap.  There is now
             one for each endpoint.

        (5)  ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable is now recommended to be on.

        (6)  frVCSigProced was slightly unclear.  The values are
             clarified along with associated counter definitions.

        (7)  The behaviour of the PVC statuses and the Endpt Sig
             Statuses are clarified when an underlying layer fails.

        (8)  frPVCConnectIndexValue was added.

        (9)  An ifStackTable example was added.

        (10) Additional counters for PVCs were added.

        (11) Names for PVCs were added.

        (12) Addition of counters to track frames offered (in)
             and delivered (out) for increased visibility into
             policing-driven discards, congestion-driven discards,
             DE bit setting, and congestion bit setting.

        (13) Addition of Frame Relay Fragmentation objects
             frLportFragControl and frLportFragSize.

        (14) Reference to RFC 1490 changed to STD 55, RFC 2427.

        (15) Created a NOTIFICATION object identified using the
             trap prefix convention to support automatic generation
             of SMIv1 MIB.  The new object is named
             frPVCConnectStatusNotif.  The old object
             frPVCConnectStatusChange has been deprecated.  The
             compliance statements have been deprecated/created
             to match.

3.  Overview

   These objects are used when the particular media being used to manage
   is Frame Relay Service.  At present, this applies to these values of
   the ifType variable in the Internet-standard MIB:

        frameRelayService (44)

   This section provides an overview and background of how to use this
   MIB and other potential MIBs when managing a Frame Relay Service.

   Figure 1 shows the MIB stack that could be followed for managing a
   Frame Relay Service.  This is only an example and not meant to be
   inclusive.

3.1.  Scope of MIB

The Frame Relay Service MIB manages the Frame Relay portion of the
network and functions as a Customer Network Management interface for the
Frame Relay service.

This MIB will NOT be implemented on User Equipment (e.g., DTE), and the


Expires December 1999                                           [Page 8]


Internet Draft          Frame Relay Service MIB                June 1999


Frame Relay DTE MIB (RFC2115[18]) should be used to manage those
devices.  Concentrators may also use this MIB instead of the Frame Relay
DTE MIB.

Frame Relay Service MIB is intended to be used for Customer Network
Management (CNM) of a Frame Relay Network Service.  It provides
information that allows end-customers to obtain performance monitoring,
fault detection, and configuration information about their Frame Relay
Service.  It is an implementation decision as to whether this MIB is
used to create/delete/modify PVCs and to turn PVCs on or off.

By using this and other related MIBs, a customer's NMS can monitor their
PVCs and UNI/NNI logical ports.  Internal aspects of the network (e.g.,
switching elements, line cards, and network routing tables) are outside
the scope of this MIB.  The Customer's NMS will typically access the
SNMP proxy-agent within the Frame Relay network using SNMP over UDP over
IP with IP encapsulated in Frame Relay according to STD 55, RFC2427 and
ITU X.36 Annex D [23].  The customer, thus, has a PVC to the SNMP
proxy-agent.  Alternate access mechanisms and SNMP agent implementations
are possible.  The service capabilities include retrieving information
and receiving TRAPs.  It is beyond the scope of this MIB to define
managed objects to monitor the physical layer.  Existing physical layer
MIBs (e.g., DS1 MIB) and MIB II will be used as possible.  The Frame
Relay Service SNMP MIB for CNM will not contain any managed objects to
monitor the physical layer.  This MIB primarily addresses Frame Relay
PVCs.  This MIB may be extended at a later time to handle Frame Relay
SVCs.

This MIB is only used to manage a single Frame Relay Service offering
from one network.  This MIB will typically be implemented on a service
provider's SNMP proxy-agent. The SNMP proxy-agent proxies for all Frame
Relay equipment within one service provider's Frame Relay network.
(Other SNMP agent implementations are not precluded.)  Therefore, this
MIB models a PVC segment through one Frame Relay Network.  See Figure 2.
If the customer's PVCs traverse multiple networks, then the customer
needs to poll multiple network proxy-agents within each Frame Relay
Network to retrieve their end-to-end view of their service.

   Also, since the Frame Relay network is a shared network amongst many
   Frame Relay subscribers, each subscriber will only have access to
   their information (e.g., information with respect to their interfaces
   and PVCs).  Therefore, in order to provide this capability, the Frame
   Relay PVC CNM proxy agent should be able to support instance level
   granularity for MIB views.  See the Service Management Architecture.

Internet Draft          Frame Relay Service MIB                June 1999


3.2.  Frame Relay Service MIB Terminology

   Access Channel - An access channel generically refers to the DS1/E1
   or DS3/E3-based UNI access channel or NNI access channel across which
   frame relay data transits. An access channel is the access pathway
   for a single stream of user data.

   Within a given T1 line, an access channel can denote any one of the
   following:

    o    Unchannelized T1 - the entire T1 line is considered an access
         channel. Each access channel is comprised of 24 T1 time slots.

    o    Channelized T1 - an access channel is any one of 24 channels.
         Each access channel is comprised of a single T1 time slot.

    o    Fractional T1 - an access channel is a grouping of N T1 time
         slots (NX56/64 Kbps, where N = 1-23 T1 Time slots per FT1 Access
         Channel) that may be assigned in consecutive or non-consecutive
         order.

   Within a given E1 line, a channel can denote any one of the following:

    o    Unchannelized E1 - the entire E1 line is considered a single
         access channel.  Each access channel is comprised of 31 E1 time
         slots.

    o    Channelized E1 - an access channel is any one of 31 channels.
         Each access channel is comprised of a single E1 time slot.

    o    Fractional E1 - an access channel is a grouping of N E1 time
         slots (NX64 Kbps, where N = 1-30 E1 time slots per FE1 access
         channel) that may be assigned in consecutive or non-consecutive
         order.

   Within a given unformatted line, the entire unformatted line is
   considered an access channel. Examples include RS-232, V.35, V.36 and
   X.21 (non- switched), and unframed Ei (G.703 without G.704).

   Access Rate - The data rate of the access channel, expressed in
   bits/second.  The speed of the user access channel determines how
   rapidly the end user can inject data into the network.

   Bc - The Committed Burst Size (Bc) is the maximum amount of
   subscriber data (expressed in bits) that the network agrees to

   transfer, under normal conditions, during a time interval Tc.

   Be - The Excess Burst Size (Be) is the maximum amount of subscriber
   data (expressed in bits) in excess of Bc that the network will
   attempt to deliver during the time interval Tc.  This data (Be) is
   delivered in general with a lower probability than Bc.

   CIR - The Committed Information Rate (CIR) is the subscriber data
   rate (expressed in bits/second) that the network commits to deliver
   under normal network conditions.  CIR is averaged over the time
   interval Tc (CIR = Bc/Tc).

   DLCI - Data Link Connection Identifier

   Logical Port - This term is used to model the Frame Relay "interface"
   on a device.

   NNI - Network to Network Interface

   Permanent Virtual Connection (PVC) - A virtual connection that has
   its end-points and bearer capabilities defined at subscription time.

   Time slot (E1) - An octet within the 256-bit information field in
   each E1 frame is defined as a time slot. Time slots are position
   sensitive within the 256-bit information field. Fractional E1 service
   is provided in contiguous or non-contiguous time slot increments.

   Time slot (T1) - An octet within the 192-bit information field in
   each T1 frame is defined as a time slot. Time slots are position
   sensitive within the 192-bit information field. Fractional T1 service
   is provided in contiguous or non-contiguous time slot increments.

   UNI - User to Network Interface

   N391 - Full status (status of all PVCs) polling counter

   N392 - Error threshold

   N393 - Monitored events count

   T391 - Link integrity verification polling timer

   T392 - Polling verification timer

   nT3 - Status enquiry timer

   Use the System Group to describe the SNMP proxy-agent.  The proxy-
   agent may be monitoring many Frame Relay devices in one network. The
   System Group does not describe Frame Relay devices monitored by the
   SNMP proxy-agent.

   sysDescr:  ASCII string describing the SNMP proxy-agent.
              Can be up to 255 characters long. This field is
              generally used to indicate the network providers
              identification and type of service offered.

   sysObjectID:  Unique OBJECT IDENTIFIER (OID) for the SNMP
                 proxy-agent.

   sysUpTime:  Clock in the SNMP proxy-agent; TimeTicks
               in 1/100s of a second.  Elapsed type since
               the proxy-agent came on line.

   sysContact:  Contact for the SNMP proxy-agent.
                ASCII string of up to 255 characters.

   sysName:  Domain name of the SNMP proxy-agent, for example,
             acme.com

   sysLocation:  Location of the SNMP proxy-agent.
                 ASCII string of up to 255 characters.

   sysServices:  Services of the managed device.  The value "2",
                 which implies that
                 the Frame Relay network is providing
                 a subnetwork level service, is recommended.


3.3.2.  Interfaces Table (ifTable, ifXtable)

This specifies how the Interfaces Group defined in MIB II shall be used
for the management of Frame Relay based interfaces, and in conjunction
with the Frame Relay Service MIB module. This memo assumes the
interpretation of the evolution of the Interfaces group to be in

Internet Draft          Frame Relay Service MIB                June 1999


accordance with: "The interfaces table (ifTable) contains information on
the managed resource's interfaces.  Each sub- layer below the
internetwork layer of a network interface is considered an interface."
Thus, the ifTable allows the following Frame Relay-based interfaces to
be represented as table entries:

- Frame Relay interfaces in the Frame Relay equipment (e.g.,
  switches, routers or networks) with Frame Relay interfaces.
  This level is concerned with generic frame counts and
  not with individual virtual connections.

In accordance with the guidelines of ifTable, frame counts per virtual
connection are not covered by ifTable, and are considered interface
specific and covered in the Frame Relay Service MIB module.  In order to
interrelate the ifEntries properly, the Interfaces Stack Group shall be
supported.

Some specific interpretations of ifTable for Frame Relay follow.

 ======                 =============================================
 ifIndex                Each Frame Relay port is represented by an
                        ifEntry.

 ifDescr                Description of the Frame Relay interface.
                        ASCII string describing the UNI/NNI logical
                        port.  Can be up to 255 characters long.

 ifType                 The value allocated for Frame Relay Service
                        is equal to 44.

 ifMtu                  Set to maximum frame size in octets for this
                        frame relay logical port.

 ifSpeed                Peak bandwidth in bits per second available
                        for use. This could be the speed of the
                        logical port and not the access rate. Actual
                        user information transfer rate (i.e., access
                        rate) of the UNI or NNI logical port in bits
                        per second (this is not the clocking speed).
                        For example, it is 1,536,000 bits per second
                        for a DS1-based UNI/NNI logical port and
                        1,984,000 bits per second for an E1-based
                        UNI/NNI logical port.

          -- The PVC End-Point Group

          -- This table is used to identify the traffic parameters
          -- for a bi-directional PVC segment end-point, and it also
          -- provides statistics for a PVC segment
          -- end-point.

          -- A PVC segment end-point is identified by a UNI/NNI
          -- logical port index value and DLCI index value.

          -- If the Frame Relay service provider allows
          -- the Frame Relay CNM subscriber to create, modify
          -- or delete PVCs using SNMP, then this table is used
          -- to identify and reserve
          -- the requested traffic parameters of each
          -- PVC segment end-point.  The Connection table
          -- is used to "connect" the end-points together.
          -- Not all implementations will support the
          -- capability of creating/modifying/deleting
          -- PVCs using SNMP as a feature of Frame Relay
          -- CNM service.

          -- Uni-directional PVCs are modeled with zero
          -- valued traffic parameters in one of the
          -- directions (In or Out direction) in this table.

          -- To create a PVC, the following procedures
          -- shall be followed:
          -- 1). Create the entries for the PVC segment endpoints in the
          --     frPVCEndptTable by specifying the traffic parameters
          --     for the bi-directional PVC segment endpoints.
          --     As shown in the figure, a point-to-point PVC has
          --     two endpoints, thus two entries in this table.
          --     Uni-directional PVCs are modeled
          --     with zero valued traffic parameters in one
          --     direction; all the `In' direction parameters
          --     for one Frame Relay PVC End-point or
          --     all the `Out' direction
          --     parameters for the other Frame Relay PVC
          --     End-point.

          -- The Frame Relay PVC Connection Group

          -- The Frame Relay PVC Connection Group
          -- is used to model the bi-directional
          -- PVC segment flows;
          -- point-to-point PVCs, point-to-multipoint
          -- PVCs, and multipoint-to-multipoint
          -- PVCs.

          -- This table has read-create access and
          -- is used to associate PVC end-points
          -- together as belonging to one connection.
          -- The frPVCConnectIndex is used to associate
          -- all the bi-directional flows.
          -- Not all implementations will support the
          -- capability of creating/modifying/deleting
          -- PVCs using SNMP as a feature of Frame Relay
          -- CNM service.

          -- Once the entries in the frPVCEndptTable
          -- are created, the following step are used
          -- to associate the PVC end-points as belonging
          -- to one PVC connection:
          -- 1). Obtain a unique frPVCConnectIndex
          --     using the frPVCConnectIndexValue object.
          -- 2). Connect the PVC segment endpoints together
          --     with the applicable frPVCConnectIndex value
          --     obtained via
          --     frPVCConnectIndexValue.
          --     The entries in this table are created by using
          --     the frPVCConnectRowStatus object.
          -- 3). The agent will provide the value of the
          --     corresponding instances of
          --     frPVCEndptConnectIdentifier with the
          --     the frPVCConnectIndex value.
          -- 4). Set frPVCConnectAdminStatus to `active' in all
          --     rows for this PVC segment to
          --     turn the PVC on.

9.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   No managed objects in this MIB contain sensitive information.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
