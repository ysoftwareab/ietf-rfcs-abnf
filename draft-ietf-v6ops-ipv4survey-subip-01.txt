all provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026.

Status of this Memo

Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.  Note that other
groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-Drafts.

Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at
any time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

Abstract

This document seeks to document all usage of IPv4 addresses in currently
deployed IETF Sub-IP Area documented standards.  In order to 
successfully transition from an all IPv4 Internet to an all IPv6 
Internet, many interim steps will be taken. One of these steps is the 
evolution of current protocols that have IPv4 dependencies.  It is 
hoped that these protocols (and their implementations) will be 
redesigned to be network address independent, but failing that will at 
least dually support IPv4 and IPv6.  To this end, all Standards (Full, 
Draft, and Proposed) as well as Experimental RFCs will be surveyed and 
any dependencies will be documented.

1.0 Introduction

This document is part of a document set aiming to document all usage of
IPv4 addresses in IETF stanadards. In an effort to have the information
in a manageable form, it has been broken into 7 documents conforming
to the current IETF areas (Application,  Internet, Manangement &
Operations, Routing, Security, Sub-IP and Transport).

For a full introduction, please see the intro[1] draft.



2.0 Document Organization

The rest of the document sections are described below.

Sections 3, 4, 5, and 6 each describe the raw analysis of Full, Draft,
and Proposed Standards, and Experimental RFCs.  Each RFC is discussed 
in its turn starting with RFC 1 and ending with RFC 3247.  The comments 
for each RFC is "raw" in nature.  That is, each RFC is discussed in a 
vacuum and problems or issues discussed do not "look ahead" to see if 
the problems have already been fixed.

Section 7 is an analysis of the data presented in Sections 3, 4, 5, and
6.  It is here that all of the results are considered as a whole and the
problems that have been resolved in later RFCs are correlated.



3.0 Full Standards

Full Internet Standards (most commonly simply referred to as 
"Standards") are fully mature protocol specification that are widely 
implemented and used throughout the Internet.

There are no full standars within the scope of this document.


4.0 Draft Standards

Draft Standards represent the penultimate standard level in the IETF.
A protocol can only achieve draft standard when there are multiple,
independent, interoperable implementations.  Draft Standards are usually
quite mature and widely used.

There are no draft standards within the scope of this document.


5.0 Proposed Standards

Proposed Standards are introductory level documents.  There are no
requirements for even a single implementation.  In many cases Proposed
are never implemented or advanced in the IETF standards process.  They
therefore are often just proposed ideas that are presented to the 
Internet community.  Sometimes flaws are exposed or they are one of 
many competing solutions to problems.  In these later cases, no 
discussion is presented as it would not serve the purpose of this 
discussion.


5.01 RFC 3031 Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture (MPLS)

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this protocol.


5.01 RFC 3032 MPLS Label Stack Encoding

This protocol is both IPv4 and IPv6 aware and needs no changes.


5.03 RFC 3034 Use of Label Switching on Frame Relay Networks
     Specification

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this protocol.


5.04 RFC 3035 MPLS using LDP and ATM VC Switching

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this protocol.


5.05 RFC 3036 LDP Specification

This protocol is both IPv4 and IPv6 aware and needs no changes.


5.06 RFC 3038 VCID Notification over ATM link for LDP

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this protocol.



6.0 Experimental RFCs

Experimental RFCs typically define protocols that do not have widescale
implementation or usage on the Internet.  They are often propriety in
nature or used in limited arenas.  They are documented to the Internet
community in order to allow potential interoperability or some other
potential useful scenario.  In a few cases they are presented as
alternatives to the mainstream solution to an acknowledged problem.


6.1 RFC 3063 MPLS Loop Prevention Mechanism

There are no IPv4 dependencies in this protocol.



7.0  Summary of Results

In the initial survey of RFCs 0 positives were identified out of a 
total of 7, broken down as follows:

	Standards				 0 of  0 or  0.00%
	Draft Standards				 0 of  0 or  0.00%
	Proposed Standards			 0 of  6 or  0.00%
	Experimental RFCs			 0 of  1 or  0.00%

Of those identified many require no action because they document 
outdated and unused protocols, while others are document protocols 
that are actively being updated by the appropriate working groups.  
Additionally there are many instances of standards that should be 
updated but do not cause any operational impact if they are not 
updated.  The remaining instances are documented below.



7.1  Standards

There are no standards within the scope of this document.


7.2 Draft Standards

There are no draft standards within the scope of this document.


7.3  Proposed Standards

There are no proposed standards with recommendations in this document.

7.4  Experimental RFCs

There are no experimental standards with recommendations in this
document.



8.0 Security Consideration

This memo examines the IPv6-readiness of specifications; this does not 
have security considerations in itself.
