Abstract

   This document specifies a 224-bit one-way hash function, called
   SHA-224.  A SHA-224 has value is simply the truncation of the SHA-256
   hash value.  SHA-256 is the 256-bit one-way hash function specified
   by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

1  Introduction

   This document specifies a 224-bit one-way hash function, called
   SHA-224.  One-way hash functions are also known as message digests.
   SHA-224 is based on SHA-256, the 256-bit one-way hash function
   already specified by the National Institute of Standards and
   Technology (NIST) [SHA2].  Computation of a SHA-224 hash value is two
   steps.  First, the SHA-256 hash value is computed, and then the
   resulting hash value is truncated to 224 bits.

   NIST is developing guidance on cryptographic key management, and NIST
   recently published a draft for comment [NISTGUIDE].  Five security
   levels are discussed in the guidance: 80, 112, 128, 192, and 256 bits
   of security.  One-way hash functions are available for all of these
   levels except one.  SHA-224 fills this void.  SHA-224 is a one-way
   hash function that provides 112 bits of security, which is the
   generally accepted strength of Triple-DES [3DES].

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [STDWORDS].

2  SHA-224 Description

   SHA-224 may be used to compute a one-way hash value on a message
   whose length less than 2^64 bits.

   SHA-224 makes use of SHA-256 [SHA2].  To compute a one-way hash
   value, SHA-256 uses a message schedule of sixty-four 32-bit words,
   eight 32-bit working variables, and produces a hash value of eight
   32-bit words.

   SHA-224 simply makes use of the first seven 32-bit words in the
   SHA-256 result, discarding the remaining 32-bit word in the SHA-256
   result.

3  Test Vectors

   This section includes three test vectors.  These test vectors can be
   used to test implementations of SHA-224.

3.1  Test Vector #1

   Let the message to be hashed be the 24-bit ASCII string "abc", which
   is equivalent to the following binary string:

      01100001 01100010 01100011

   The SHA-256 hash value is (in hex):

      ba7816bf 8f01cfea 414140de 5dae2223
      b00361a3 96177a9c b410ff61 f20015ad

   Truncating this value to 224-bits yields the SHA-224 hash value:

      ba7816bf 8f01cfea 414140de 5dae2223
      b00361a3 96177a9c b410ff61

3.2  Test Vector #2

   Let the message to be hashed be the 448-bit ASCII string
   "abcdbcdecdefdefgefghfghighijhijkijkljklmklmnlmnomnopnopq".

   The SHA-256 hash value is (in hex):

      248d6a61 d20638b8 e5c02693 0c3e6039
      a33ce459 64ff2167 f6ecedd4 19db06c1

   Truncating this value to 224-bits yields the SHA-224 hash value:

      248d6a61 d20638b8 e5c02693 0c3e6039
      a33ce459 64ff2167 f6ecedd4

3.3  Test Vector #3

   Let the message to hashed be the binary-coded form of the ASCII
   string which consists of 1,000,000 repetitions of the character "a".

   The SHA-256 hash value is (in hex):

      cdc76e5c 9914fb92 81a1c7e2 84d73e67
      f1809a48 a497200e 046d39cc c7112cd0

   Truncating this value to 224-bits yields the SHA-224 hash value:

      cdc76e5c 9914fb92 81a1c7e2 84d73e67
      f1809a48 a497200e 046d39cc

4  Object Identifier

   NIST has assigned an ASN.1 [X.208-88, X.209-88] object identifier for
   SHA-224.  Some protocols use object identifiers to name one-way hash
   functions.  One example is CMS [CMS].  Implementations of such
   protocols that make use of SHA-224 MUST use the following object
   identifier.

      id-sha224  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=  { joint-iso-itu-t(2)
                        country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101)
                        csor(3) nistalgorithm(4) hashalgs(2) sha224(4) }

7  Security Considerations

   One-way hash functions are typically used with other cryptographic
   algorithms, such as digital signature algorithms and keyed-hash
   message authentication codes, or in the generation of random values.
   When a one-way hash function is used in conjunction with another
   algorithm, there may be requirements specified elsewhere that require

INTERNET DRAFT                                             November 2003


   the use of a one-way hash function with a certain number of bits of
   security.  For example, if a message is being signed with a digital
   signature algorithm that provides 128 bits of security, then that
   signature algorithm may require the use of a one-way hash algorithm
   that also provides the same number of bits of security.  SHA-224 is
   intended to provide 112 bits of security, which is the generally
   accepted strength of Triple-DES [3DES].

   This document is intended to provide the SHA-224 specification to the
   Internet community.  No independent assertion of the security of this
   one-way hash function by the author for any particular use is
   intended.  However, as long as SHA-256 provides the expected
   security, SHA-224 will also provide its expected level of security.
