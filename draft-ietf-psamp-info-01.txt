Abstract

   This document defines an information and data model for the Packet
   Sampling (PSAMP) protocol. It is used by the PSAMP protocol for
   encoding sampled packet data and information related to the sampling
   process. The model is an extension to the IPFIX information model.

1. Open Issues

   This section covers some open issues which have to be solved in a
   future version of this draft:

   We currently define the sampling/filtering  algorithm and the hash
   function field as an simple 8-bit identifier. This implies that an
   extension is very easy. Nevertheless, it might be appropriate to have
   single field for each method in order to integrate special
   information about the sampling/filtering algorithm or the hash
   function directly into the field.

   The PSAMP protocol allows to define more than one sampling or
   filtering method which are applied in a sequential order. Therfore,
   the order of the fields in a template becomes important. This is a
   primary difference to the semantics of the flow template in the IPFIX
   definition. Currently, we do not have a proper definition for the
   ordering of flow fields.

   The unit property is currently optional, but we would like to have
   information about units wherever possible. The unit property may
   become mandatory in a future version of this document and we would
   define the unit as "not applicable" when no unit can be given.

   This document only defines the fields for exporting PSAMP data that
   are not defined by the IPFIX information model. Nevertheless, we
   should include a usage statement for the fields defined by IPFIX when
   used by the PSAMP export protocol or include a special section
   discussing the usage of IPFIX fields by PSAMP.

   The export of sampled data may not need all fields defined by the
   IPFIX information model. Thus a section within this document should
   give an overview of flow fields defined in the IPFIX information
   model and their usage in the PSAMP environment.

   The flow state sampling, random non-uniform probabilistic sampling,
   the mask filtering and the router state filtering are currently not
   covered by the information model because the fields needed for these
   algorithm still need to be specified.

   The observation point is currently not covered by the IPFIX
   information model. It is not clear if we should include the
   observation point by ourselves or if we should wait for IPFIX to
   include it in their information model.

   The number space for field types is not assigned by any directory
   (IANA), yet. It currently starts at 1024 to leave enough space for
   the IPFIX fields.

2. Introduction

   Packet sampling techniques are required for various measurement
   scenarios. The packet sampling (PSAMP) protocol provides mechanisms
   for the packet selection using different filtering and sampling
   techniques. A standard way for the export and storage of such sampled
   packet data is required. The definition of the PSAMP information and
   data model is based on the IP Flow Information eXport (IPFIX)
   protocol [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol]. The PSAMP protocol document
   [I-D.ietf-psamp-protocol] describes how to use the IPFIX protocol in
   the PSAMP context.

   This document examines the IPFIX information model
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info] and extends it to meet the PSAMP requirements.
   Therefore, the structure of this document is strongly based on the
   IPFIX document. It complements the PSAMP protocol specification by
   providing an appropriate PSAMP information model. The main part of
   this document, section 6, defines the list of fields to be
   transmitted by the PSAMP protcol. Sections 5 and 4 describe the data
   types and field properties used within this document and their
   relationship to the IPFIX information model.

   The main body of section 6 was generated from a XML document. The
   XML-based specification of the PSAMP fields can be used for
   automatically checking syntactical correctness of the specification.
   Furthermore it can be used - in combination with the IPFIX
   information model - for an automated code generation. The resulting
   code can be used in PSAMP protocol implementations to deal with
   processing PSAMP fields.

   For that reason, the XML document that served as source for section 6
   is attached to this document in Appendix A.

   Note that although partially generated from the attached XML
   documents, the main body of this document is normative while the
   appendices are informational.

3. Relationship between PSAMP and IPFIX

   As described in IETF working document
   draft-quittek-psamp-ipfix-01.txt [I-D.quittek-psamp-ipfix], a PSAMP
   data record can be seen as a very special IPFIX flow record. It
   represents an IPFIX flow containing only a single packet. Therefore,
   the IPFIX information model can be used as a basis for PSAMP reports.
   Nevertheless, there are properties required in PSAMP reports which
   cannot be modeled using the current IPFIX information model. This
   document describes extensions to the IPFIX model which allow the
   modeling of information and data required by PSAMP.

4. Properties of a PSAMP Information Element

   The PSAMP information elements are in accordance with the definitions
   of IPFIX. Therefore we do not repeat the properties in this draft.
   Nevertheless, we strongly recommend to define the optional "usage"
   and "unit" elements for every field (if applicable).

5. Type Space

   The PSAMP fields MUST be constructed from the basic data types
   described in the IPFIX Information Model [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info]. To
   avoid duplicated work and to keep consistency between IPFIX and PSAMP
   the data types are not repeated in this document.

6. The PSAMP Fields

   This sections describes the fields used by the PSAMP exporting
   functions. Basically, the fields described by the IPFIX information
   model [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info] are used by the PSAMP export functions
   where applicable. To avoid inconsistencies between the IPFIX and the
   PSAMP information and data models, only those fields are defined here
   that are not already described by the IPFIX information model.

6.1 PSAMP Usage of IPFIX Attributes

   Some fields defined by the IPFIX information model are not needed by
   the PSAMP protocol. Other fields have a different meaning or usage
   pattern than in IPFIX. This section list the IPFIX fields that are
   needed in the PSAMP context and introduces their usage.

   EDITOR NOTE: this section needs to be finished once IPFIX as well as
   PSAMP info model are stable.

7. Security Considerations

   The PSAMP information model itself does not directly introduce
   security issues. Rather it defines a set of attributes which may for
   privacy or business issues be considered sensitive information.

   The underlying protocol used to exchange the information described
   here must therefore apply appropriate procedures to guarantee the
   integrity and confidentiality of the exported information. Such
   protocols are defined in separate documents, specifically the IPFIX
   protocol document [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol].

8. IANA Considerations

   Field ID's for fields defined in this document need to be registered
   at IANA as new IPFIX field numbers.

Internet-Draft          PSAMP Information Model            February 2004


Appendix A. Formal Specification of PSAMP Fields

   This appendix containfs a formal description of the PSAMP information
   model XML document. Note that this appendix is of informational
   nature, while the text in section Section 6 generated from this
   appendix is normative.

   Using a formal and machine readable syntax for the information model
   enables the creation of PSAMP aware tools which can automatically
   adapt to extensions to the information model, by simply reading
   updated information model specifications.

   The wide availability of XML aware tools and libraries for client
   devices is a primary consideration for this choice. In particular
   libraries for parsing XML documents are readily available. Also
   mechanisms such as the Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) allow for
   transforming a source XML document into other documents. This draft
   was authored in XML and transformed according to RFC2629.

   It should be noted that the use of XML in exporters, collectors or
   other tools is not mandatory for the deployment of PSAMP. In
   particular, exporting processes do not produce or consume XML as part
   of their operation. It is expected that PSAMP collectors MAY take
   advantage of the machine readability of the information model vs.
   hardcoding their behavior or inventing proprietary means for
   accomodating extensions.

   Using XML-based specifications does not currently address possible
   IANA implications associated with XML Namespace URIs. The use of
   Namespaces as an extension mechanism implies that an IANA registered
   Namespace URI should be available and that directory names below this
   base URI be assigned for relevant IETF specifications. The authors
   are not aware of this mechanism today.
