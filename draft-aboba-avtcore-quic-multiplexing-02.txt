Abstract

   If QUIC is to be used in a peer-to-peer manner, with NAT traversal,
   then it is necessary to be able to demultiplex QUIC and other
   protocols used in WebRTC on a single UDP port. This memo discusses
   options for demultiplexing.

1.  Introduction

   QUIC [I-D.ietf-quic-transport] is a new network transport protocol.
   While it is initially intended as a replacement for TCP in order to
   better support HTTP/2 [RFC7540] it should eventually be useful as a
   general purpose transport. HTTP is an asymmetric client-server
   protocol, but other uses of QUIC might operate in a peer-to-peer
   manner and so will need effective NAT traversal using ICE [RFC5245],
   which which makes use of STUN [RFC5389] and TURN [RFC5766] to
   discover NAT bindings.  Therefore for QUIC to be utilized for peer-
   to-peer data transport, QUIC and STUN must be able to multiplex on
   the same port.

   In a WebRTC scenario where RTP is used to transport audio and video
   and QUIC is used for data exchange, SRTP [RFC3711] is keyed using
   DTLS-SRTP [RFC5764] and therefore SRTP/SRTCP [RFC3550], STUN, TURN,
   DTLS [RFC6347] and QUIC will need to be multiplexed on the same port.

   Within the W3C, a Javascript API for the use of QUIC for peer-to-peer
   data exchange [WEBRTC-QUIC] is under development within the ORTC

   Community Group.

   As noted in [RFC7983] Figure 3, protocol demultiplexing currently
   relies upon differentiation based on the first octet, as follows:

                +----------------+
                |        [0..3] -+--> forward to STUN
                |                |
                |      [16..19] -+--> forward to ZRTP
                |                |
    packet -->  |      [20..63] -+--> forward to DTLS
                |                |
                |      [64..79] -+--> forward to TURN Channel
                |                |
                |    [128..191] -+--> forward to RTP/RTCP
                +----------------+

        Figure 1: RFC 7983 packet demultiplexing algorithm.

   As noted by Colin Perkins and Lars Eggert in [QUIC-Issue] this
   created a potential conflict with the design of the QUIC headers
   described in versions of [I-D.ietf-quic-transport] prior to -08.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Solution

   At IETF 100, Colin Perkins presented a demultiplexing proposal [QUIC-
   MULTI].  The proposal which was subsequently proposed as a Pull
   Request to the QUIC Transport specification and merged in draft-ietf-
   quic-transport-08, involved renumbering of the QUIC long header
   packet type field as well as inverting the sense of the "C" bit in
   the short header packet.

   The demultiplexing algorithm resulting from the changes appears as
   follows:

                +----------------+
                |        [0..3] -+--> forward to STUN
                |                |
                |      [16..19] -+--> forward to ZRTP
                |                |
    packet -->  |      [20..63] -+--> forward to DTLS
                |                |
                |      [64..79] -+--> forward to TURN Channel
                |     [64..127] -+--> forward to QUIC (Short Header)
                |                |
                |    [128..191] -+--> forward to RTP/RTCP
                |    [250..255]  +--> forward to QUIC (Long Header)
                +----------------+

        Figure 2: Revised packet demultiplexing algorithm.

   Note that while the above diagram has a potential conflict between
   packets sent in TURN Channels and the QUIC short header, this
   conflict is not considered serious for WebRTC where TURN Channels are
   rarely used.

2.1.  Subsequent changes

   Since then, additional changes have been made to the QUIC transport
   headers.  While the QUIC Long Header packet type field retains its
   original allocations between 0x7C and 0x7F, as of draft -15, the
   first octet of the Short Header now appears as follows:

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |0|K|1|1|0|R|R|R|
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Where:

   K = indicates the key phase.
   R = reserved bits, set randomly by endpoints not actively using them.

   This potentially produces values of the first octet in the ranges
   48-55 which potentially conflicts with DTLS, and 80-87 which
   conflicts with TURN channels (not an issue).

3.  Security Considerations

   The solutions discussed in this document could potentially introduce
   some additional security considerations beyond those detailed in



Aboba, et. al                 Informational                     [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT              QUIC Multiplexing            23 October 2018


   [RFC7983].

   Due to the additional logic required, if mis-implemented, heuristics
   have the potential to mis-classify packets.

   When QUIC is used for only for data exchange, the TLS-within-QUIC
   exchange [I-D.ietf-quic-tls] derives keys used solely to protect the
   QUIC data packets.  If properly implemented, this should not affect
   the transport of SRTP nor the derivation of SRTP keys via DTLS-SRTP,
   but if badly implemented, both transport and key derivation could be
   adversely impacted.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require actions by IANA.
