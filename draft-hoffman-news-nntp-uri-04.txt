Abstract

   This document specifies the news and nntp Uniform Resource Identifier
   (URI) schemes that were originally specified in RFC 1738.  The
   purpose of this document is to allow RFC 1738 to be made obsolete
   while keeping the information about the scheme on standards track.

1.  Introduction

   URIs were previously defined in RFC 2396 [RFC2396], which was updated

Internet-Draft       The news and nntp URI Schemes          January 2005


   by draft-fielding-uri-rfc2396bis [2396bis].  Those documents also
   specify how to define schemes for URIs.

   The first definition for many URI schemes appeared in RFC 1738
   [RFC1738].  Because that document has been made obsolete, this
   document copies the news and nntp URI schemes from it to allow that
   material to remain on standards track.

   Note: the definitions for the news and nntp URI schemes given here
   are significant updates from RFC 1738 based on modern usage of these
   schemes.

   Note: it is likely that the specification in this document will
   change based on input from the Usenet protocol community before this
   document is finalized.

2.  Scheme Definition

   The news and nntp URL schemes are used to refer to either news groups
   or individual articles of USENET news, as specified in RFC 1036.

   The news URL takes the form:

      newsURL     = "news"  ":" [ news-server ]
                       ( newsgroup-name | '*' | message-id )
      news-server =  "//" server "/"
      message-id  = id-left "@" id-right

   <server> is defined in [2396bis].  Note that there is widespread use
   of the username-password authentication in news servers, so news
   clients should implement this part of the <server> syntax.

2.1  The newsURL has a <newsgroup-name>

   The <newsgroup-name> is a period-delimited hierarchical name, such as
   "comp.lang.perl.modules".  <id-left> and <id-right> are defined in
   Section 3.6.4 of RFC 2822 [RFC2822].

   The resource retrieved by this URL is some means to gain access to
   the articles in the given <newsgroup-name> that are available on the
   given <server> (usually by invoking a suitable news reading agent
   initialized to access that group).  If no <server> is specified, the
   groups are to be retrieved from whatever server has been configured
   for local use.

2.2  The newsURL has a *

   If the last part of the newsURL is "*" (as in <URL:news:*>), it is

Internet-Draft       The news and nntp URI Schemes          January 2005


   used to refer to "all available news groups".  The resource retrieved
   by this URL is some means to gain access to all the newsgroups that
   are available on the given <server> (usually by invoking a suitable
   news reading agent).  If no <server> is specified, the access is to
   be to whatever server has been configured for local use.

2.3  The newsURL has a <message-id>

   The resource retrieved by this URL is the Netnews article with the
   given <message-id>.  In a properly working Netnews system, the same
   article will be obtained whatever server is accessed for the purpose
   (assuming the server in question carried that article in the first
   place and that it has not expired).  If no <server> is specified, the
   article is to be retrieved from whatever server has been configured
   for local use.

   The <id-left> and the <id-right> MUST be in a canonical form in which
   no <quoted-string> or <quoted-pair> is used in a context where the
   same semantic meaning could have been rendered without such quoting;
   moreover, no whitespace may be included, whether %-encoded or not
   and/or quoted or not.

   For example, neither

      news:"abcd"@example.com

   nor

      "ab\cd"@example.com

   is in canonical form, because the form

      abcd@example.com

   is available.

2.4  The nntp URL scheme

   The nntp URL defined in RFC 1738 is deprectated.  This section is
   likely to be replaced in a future version of this draft.

3.  Security Considerations

   There are many security considerations for URI schemes discussed in
   [2396bis].  The news protocol uses passwords in the clear for
   authentication, and offers no privacy, both of which are considered
   extremely unsafe in current practice.
