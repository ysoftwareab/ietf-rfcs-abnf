Abstract

   In information-centric networking (ICN), uniquely identifiable and
   location independent names are assigned directly to the named data
   which raises scalability issues and they get even worse with flat
   names. Accordingly, name resolution system required for lookup-by-
   name routing in ICN has to be designed to scale, also considering
   mobility support. In this draft, a bloom filter-based flat name
   resolution system (B-NRS) is proposed where the bloom filter as an
   aggregated form of names and hierarchical structure of the B-NRS are
   exploited to address the scalability issues.

Internet-Draft         Bloom filter-based NRS           September 2014


1. Introduction

   In contrast to the host-centric networking in the current Internet,
   the primary communication object in information-centric networking
   (ICN) is named data, where uniquely identifiable and location
   independent name is assigned directly to the named data. This shift
   raises scalability issues to a new level. The current Internet is
   addressing on the order of 10^9 nodes, whereas the number of
   addressable ICN objects is expected to be several orders of
   magnitude higher [ICNRG charter]. Accordingly, name resolution
   system required both for lookup-by-name routing in ICN [ICN
   Challenges] and for ICN-IoT architecture [ICN-IoT] has to be
   designed to scale, also considering mobility support.

   In this draft, we propose a bloom filter-based flat name resolution
   system (B-NRS) which maintains and resolves the binding between
   names and locators, i.e. B-NRS takes a name as its input and
   produces the locator sets that the name is currently associated with.
   We assume that the locator independent names are flat since the flat
   names provide some advantages compared to hierarchical ones, such as
   higher flexibility, simpler name allocation and benefits in terms of
   persistency and privacy [Ghodsi, ITU]. On the other hand,
   scalability becomes the most important challenge on designing the
   NRS supporting flat names. It is because of the ever increasing
   number of names in the network and no possible way to compactly
   represent the flat names such as the aggregation in IP addresses.

   In order to address the scalability issue in designing the NRS for
   flat name, we need to aggregate names in any shape of type. One
   popular technique for flat name is Distributed Hashing Table (DHT)
   based approach [Hanka, Luo, Ahlgren, Mathy], where multiple servers
   form circular linked list and the bindings are stored in the
   appropriate server. However, the DHT technique has some drawbacks;
   the binding must be stored in a server other than the owner's, which
   causes a serious trust problem related to the authority issue  and
   lookup message may be propagated through the long paths.

   In this draft, to overcome the drawbacks of DHT, we exploit the
   bloom filter as an aggregated form of names and hierarchically
   construct the B-NRS. One of the major benefits of the bloom filter
   is a fixed constant time of insertion and search which is completely
   independent of the number of names already in the set. Another
   important and powerful property of bloom filter is the efficient
   support for union of bloom filters with the same size and set of
   hash functions which can be implemented with bitwise OR. However,
   bloom filter also has some drawbacks; false positive and no member
   deletion. Although there is no way to get rid of the false positive,

   it can be minimized by choosing the right parameters. The deletion
   problem is also taken care by periodic reconstruct of the bloom
   filters or by using variants of the bloom filter such as the
   counting bloom filter.

   We note that the B-NRS in this draft does not require any specific
   mechanism for registering names, since names have no structure and
   can be registered to any B-NRS server with no constraint. Thus, the
   B-NRS needs only lookup mechanism. Whereas in the DHT-based system,
   the lookup message for a name is forwarded by the same way how to
   register the name.

2. Bloom filter-based flat name resolution system (B-NRS)

   We propose a bloom filter-based name resolution system (B-NRS) for
   supporting flat name which maintains and resolves the binding
   between names and locators.

2.1. System structure

   We construct the B-NRS hierarchically by defining a network of B-NRS
   servers, which consists of a forest by several disjoint trees. The
   network of B-NRS servers is defined by both parent-child and peering
   relationships. Figure 1 is an example of the B-NRS structure which
   consists of 8 B-NRS servers forming a tree.

   A B-NRS server consists of a name lookup table which stores the
   binding between names and locators for all names which are directly
   registered to the BRS server. The lookup table takes a name as the
   input and produces its associated locator sets as the output.

   We utilize bloom filters as an aggregated form of names at each B-
   NRS server. B-NRS servers announce their name set to the other B-NRS
   servers. Instead of announcing the whole list of names, bloom filter
   as an aggregated form of names is announced. When announcing its
   name set to its peers or parents, the B-NRS server announces the
   union of name sets of all child B-NRS servers. Union of child name
   sets can be built by using the characteristic of bloom filer that
   bloom filter for union of sets can be built merely by bitwise 'OR'
   operation on all the sets. Thus, each B-NRS server stores bloom
   filters for itself, from children, and from peers.

   We note that the forest of B-NRS servers retains the loop-free
   property for the use of bloom filter.

   At the top of the trees, the B-NRS servers are fully peered, which
   means that each server shares its knowledge of all names that it

Internet-Draft         Bloom filter-based NRS           September 2014


   manages with its peers. A leaf B-NRS server knows every single
   name/locator pair that it manages but nothing else. The intermediate
   B-NRS servers know the name/locator pair for all names that are
   directly registered to them and also possess only information about
   the names that their descendant and peer B-NRS servers manage.

2.2. Key operations

2.2.1. Name registration

   When a communication entity attempts to join the network, it must
   register itself in at least one B-NRS server. In this draft, it is
   allowed that the communication entity can be registered in any
   arbitrary B-NRS server since names have no structure.

   Upon receiving the registration request from the communication
   entity, the B-NRS server registers the name to its lookup table. The
   locators for the name are stored in the table when the communication
   entity for the name is actually present into the network. We
   separate this as the operation of locator update from the name
   registration.

   The name registration is along with bloom filter update. When a
   communication entity is registered in a B-NRS server, the
   registration information is extracted from its name using the hash
   functions for its bloom filter and inserted into its own bloom
   filter first and then the B-NRS server updates bloom filters for its
   parents and peers, where this recursion holds until bloom filters at
   the top of trees are completely updated.

   Figure 2 shows an example of the name registration and bloom filter
   updates, where a new name is registered at the B-NRS server, S4. It
   inserts information of the new name first into its own bloom filter
   and updates its parent, S2. Then, S2 updates its parent, S1 and its
   peer, S3.

   When names are deleted from the lookup table, we need to adopt a
   certain mechanism to update the bloom filters for the deletion since
   bloom filter cannot handle the deletion by itself. Thus, we use the
   periodic refresh technique that bloom filters with registered names
   are rebuilt periodically and followed by bloom filter updates.

2.2.2. Locator Update

   When a communication entity actually presents in the network, the
   locator update is occurred, where the gateway sends the locator
   update message to the correspondent B-NRS server and the locator
   associated with the name is stored in the lookup table. If the name
   has multiple locators, then they are stored as a set of locators for
   the name. Through the bloom filter test of the name, the locator
   update messages are forwarded into the lookup table where the name
   is actually stored.

   When the communication entity depresents from the network, the
   locators for the name is deleted from the lookup table by the
   locator update message as well. Thus, changing locators has no

   effect on the structure of the B-NRS and mobility is easily
   supported.

   Table 1 is an example of lookup table where there is no locator for
   the name, N3, which means the depresence of entity for N3.


   Table 1. Lookup table
   =================================
    Name |  Locators
   =================================
     N1  |  LOC1
     N2  |  LOC2-1, LOC2-2
     N3  |  -
     N4  |  LOC4-1, LOC4-2, LOC4-3
   =================================


2.2.3. Lookup

   The lookup operation is to find the locator information for a given
   name. The simplest case is when the source object tries to
   communicate with the destination object registered in the same B-NRS
   server. B-NRS server always searches for the destination name in its
   own lookup table first so the locator information is acquired at the
   first lookup in such a case.

   A harder, but more interesting, case is when the destination object
   is registered in the other B-NRS server with the source object. In
   this case, the B-NRS server would quickly learn that the destination
   object is not registered in the same B-NRS server by a simple search
   of its lookup table. Then, it searches bloom filters for its child
   and peer B-NRS servers. If none of the bloom filters return a
   positive answer, the lookup request message is forwarded to its
   parent B-NRS server. On the other hand, if any of bloom filters
   return a positive answer, the lookup request message is forwarded to
   every B-NRS server that corresponds to the bloom filters with
   positive answers. We note that because of the false positives of the
   bloom filter, multiple bloom filters may return positive answers.

   This search is done recursively, and the locator information for the
   destination name can eventually be found. Once the locator
   information is found, it is delivered to the source object by the
   lookup reply message which takes the reverse path of the lookup
   request message.

   Figure 3 is an example of lookup and registration processes where
   the lookup message for a name which is registered at S8 is received
   by S4. Then, the lookup message is forwarded to S2. Since S2 is
   peered with S3, S2 forwards it to S3 not to S1. S3 forwards it to S8.
   The reply message takes the reverse path of the lookup request
   message, i.e., S8->S3->S2->S4.

3. Comparison of B-NRS with other NRSs

   One of the critical challenges in designing NRS is scalability due
   to the ever increasing number of names. In order to overcome this
   issue, names need to be distributed and also aggregated in any shape
   of type especially for flat names. One popular technique to
   distribute and aggregate names is to use DHT (Distributed Hash
   Table). However, DHT has several drawbacks such as ownership,
   deployment, locality, etc. Thus, we exploit the bloom filter as an
   aggregated form of names and hierarchically construct the NRS.

Internet-Draft         Bloom filter-based NRS           September 2014


   As illustrated in figure 4, NRS can be roughly divided into two
   types: centralized vs. distributed. Then, the distributed type can
   be divided again into two approaches: DHT-based vs. all else. DMap
   (Direct Mapping) [DMap] and MDHT (Multiple DHT) [MDHT] are examples
   of DHT-based approach. DMap is proposed by MF (MobilityFirst) which
   is one of the Future Internet architecture projects funded by NSF in
   US and MDHT is by SAIL (Scalable and Adaptive Internet Solutions)

   but not DHT-based approach.

   Figure 4. A simple Venn diagram categorizing NRS



   Table 2 presents the comparison of B-NRS with DMap and MDHT in
   respect of scalability, lookup latency and locator update.

   For scalability, we compare how many names can be scalable for each
   NRS. DMap assumes that the number of names is 5*10^9, whereas MDHT
   and B-NRS assume that it is 10^15.

   We define the lookup latency as the multiple of the number of hops,
   H, and the processing time per hop, T(N), which is proportional to
   the number of table entries, N. The lookup latencies for both DMap
   and MDHT are increasing proportionally to the number of hops and the
   number of table entries at each hop since the table lookup is
   processed at each hop. However, the lookup latency for B-NRS is
   dependent only to the number of hops since BF takes a fixed constant
   time, C, for searching. Even though each B-NRS server has several
   bloom filters, they are independent to each other and can be
   parallelized in a hardware implementation.

   For locator update, we look at the staleness. Both DMap and MDHT do
   the location update periodically so the staleness occurs during it
   is not updated. However, the staleness for B-NRS occurs with
   probability 0 since it does the location update in real time.

   number of table entries and hops, respectively and C is a constant.)

4. Security Considerations

   False positive error is one of the well-known drawbacks of bloom
   filter and there is no way to get rid of it. Thus, it can be an
   attack point. For example, if an attacker puts wrong information
   into bloom filters of B-NRS in order to increase the false positive
   error rate resulting in getting traffics to go far away and
   consuming resource, then the performance degradation may occur until
   the B-NRS is refreshed. Once B-NRS is rebuilt, there will be only
   probabilistic false positive error rate not the deterministic one.



5. IANA Considerations

   TBD
