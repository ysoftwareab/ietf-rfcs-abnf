Internet-Draft              inter-as-te-link                  March 2018


1.  Introduction

   Connections among different Autonomous Systems (ASes) may be point-
   to-point (P2P) links and broadcast links.  For a P2P inter-AS TE
   link, RFC 5316 defines a new TLV, the inter-AS reachability TLV, for
   advertising the link.

   It also defines three new sub-TLVs for inclusion in the inter-AS
   reachability TLV to carry the information about the neighboring AS
   number and the remote ASBR ID of an inter-AS link.

   For a P2P inter-AS link, the information about its remote ASBR may be
   configured.  For a broadcast inter-AS link, no item configured
   corresponds to the designated router (DR) of the link in ISIS.  Since
   no ISIS runs over any broadcast inter-AS link, no DR is selected.  It
   is hard to configure an item corresponding to the DR on a broadcast
   link.

   This document presents extensions to ISIS for advertising broadcast
   inter-AS TE links through defining a new sub-TLV for a broadcast link
   without configuring any item corresponding to the DR on the link.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Information on Inter-AS TE Link

   For a broadcast link connecting multiple ASBRs in a number of ASes,
   on each of the ASBRs X, the following information about the link may
   be obtained:

     1)  Link Type: Multi-access
     2)  Local IP address with mask length
     3)  Traffic engineering metric
     4)  Maximum bandwidth
     5)  Maximum reservable bandwidth
     6)  Unreserved bandwidth
     7)  Administrative group
     8)  SRLG


   No remote IP address or item corresponding to the DR (i.e., DR's
   interface address) may be obtained.

4.  Extensions to ISIS

4.1.  sub-TLVs

   Two new sub-TLVs are defined.  One is for local IPv4 address with
   mask length; and the other is for local IPv6 address with mask
   length.

   The format of the sub-TLV for a local IPv4 address with mask length
   is shown as follows.

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |         Type (stTBD1)         |             Length            |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                    IPv4 Address (4 bytes)                     |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |  Mask Length  |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The IPv4 Address indicates the local IPv4 address of a link.  The
   Mask Length indicates the length of the IPv4 address mask.

   The format of the sub-TLV for a local IPv6 address with mask length
   is illustrated below.

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |        Type (stTBD2)          |             Length            |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                     IPv6 Address (16 bytes)                   |
     ~                                                               ~
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |  Mask Length  |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The IPv6 Address indicates the local IPv6 address of a link.  The
   Mask Length indicates the length of the IPv6 address mask.

4.2.1.  ISIS Router Procedure

   For a broadcast inter-AS link connecting to multiple ASBRs, each of
   the ASBRs as an ISIS router advertises an LSP with an inter-AS
   reachability TLV, which contains sub-TLVs for the information such as
   1) 10 8) about the broadcast link described in Section 3.  It does
   not contain any sub-TLVs indicating remote ASBR, instead, it includes
   a sub-TLV for the local IP address with network mask.

   When TE is enabled on an inter-AS link and the link is up, the ASBR
   SHOULD advertise this link using the normal procedures for ISIS-TE.
   When either the link is down or TE is disabled on the link, the ASBR
   SHOULD withdraw the advertisement.  When there are changes to the TE
   parameters for the link (for example, when the available bandwidth
   changes), the ASBR SHOULD re-advertise the link but MUST take
   precautions against excessive re-advertisements.

4.2.2.  Super Node Procedure

   Suppose that there is a super node, which just receives LSPs from
   each of ASes (or domains) through a passive ISIS adjacency between
   the super node and an ASBR or a normal router in the AS or domain.

   For a new broadcast link connecting multiple routers, when the super
   node receives an LSP containing the link attached to router X, it
   stores the link from X into its TED.  It finds the link's remote end
   P using the link's local IP address with network mask.  P is a Pseudo
   node identified by the local IP address of the DR selected from the
   routers connected to the link.  After finding P, it associates the
   link attached to X with P and the link connected to P with X. If P is
   not found, a new Pseudo node P is created.  The super node associates
   the link attached to X with P and the link attached to P with X. This
   creates a bidirectional connection between X and P.

   The first router and second router from which the super node receives
   an LSP containing the link are selected as the DR and BDR
   respectively.  After the DR is down, the BDR becomes the DR and the
   router other than the DR with the largest (or smallest) local IP
   address connecting to the link is selected as the BDR.

   When the old DR is down and the BDR becomes the new DR, the super
   node updates its TED through removing the link between each of
   routers X and old P (the Pseudo node corresponding to the old DR) and
   adding a link between each of routers X (still connecting to the
   broadcast link) and new P (the Pseudo node corresponding to the new
   DR).
