   Note: This CPS is based on the template specified in RFC 3647. A 
   number of sections contained in the template were omitted from this 
   CPS because they did not apply to this PKI. However, we have 
   retained section heading "place holders" for these omitted sections, 
   in order to facilitate comparison with the section numbering scheme 
   employed in that RFC, i.e., the relevant section headings are 
   included and marked [OMITTED]. In the Table of Contents the relevant 
   sections are also marked [OMITTED]. There is a note to this effect 
   in the Introduction below.  This information should be left in the 
   CPS as an explanation to the user. 

1. Introduction 

   This document is the Certification Practice Statement (CPS) of <Name 
   of Registry>.  It describes the practices employed by the <Name of 
   Registry> Certification Authority (CA) in the Internet IP Address 
   and Autonomous System (AS) Number PKI.   These practices are defined 
   in accordance with the requirements of the Certificate Policy (CP, 
   [RFCxxxx]) of this PKI.  

   The Internet IP Address and AS Number PKI is aimed at supporting 
   verifiable attestations about resource controls, e.g., for improved 
   routing security. The goal is that each entity that allocates IP 
   addresses or AS numbers to an entity will, in parallel, issue a 
   certificate reflecting this allocation. These certificates will 
   enable verification that the holder of the associated private key 
   has been allocated the resources indicated in the certificate, and 
   is the current, unique holder of these resources. The certificates 
   and CRLs, in conjunction with ancillary digitally signed data 
   structures, will provide critical inputs for routing security 
   mechanisms, e.g., generation of route filters by ISPs.   

   The most important and distinguishing aspect of the PKI for which 
   this CPS was created is that it does not purport to identify an 
   address space holder or AS number holder via the subject name 
   contained in the certificate issued to that entity. Rather, each 
   certificate issued under this policy is intended to enable an entity 
 
 
Kong, Seo & Kent         Expires August 2007                  [Page 9] 

Internet-Draft  Template CPS for an Internet Registry    February 2007 
    

   to assert in a verifiable fashion, that it is the current holder of 
   an address block or an AS number, based on the current records of 
   the entity responsible for the resources in question. Verification 
   of the assertion is based on two criteria: the ability of the entity 
   to digitally sign data producing a signature that is verifiable 
   using the public key contained in the corresponding certificate, and 
   validation of that certificate in the context of this PKI. This PKI 
   is designed exclusively for use in support of validation of claims 
   related to address space and AS number holdings, with emphasis on 
   support of routing security mechanisms. Use of the certificates and 
   CRLs managed under this PKI for any other purpose is a violation of 
   this PKI's CP, and relying parties should reject such uses. 

   Note: This CPS is based on the template specified in RFC 3647. A 
   number of sections contained in the template were omitted from this 
   CPS because they did not apply to this PKI. However, we have 
   retained section heading "place holders" for these omitted sections, 
   in order to facilitate comparison with the section numbering scheme 
   employed in that RFC, i.e., the relevant section headings are 
   included and marked [OMITTED]. In the Table of Contents the relevant 
   sections are also marked [OMITTED]. 

1.1. Overview 

   This CPS describes: 

     . Participants  

     . Distribution of the certificates and CRLs 

     . How certificates are issued, managed, and revoked 

     . Facility management (physical security, personnel, audit, etc.) 

     . Key management 

     . Audit procedures 

     . Business and legal issues 

   The PKI encompasses several types of certificates: 

  . CA certificates for each organization allocating address blocks 
     and/or AS numbers, and for each address space (AS number) holder 

  . End entity ("shadow") certificates for organizations to use in 
     verifying signatures of Route Origination Authorizations (ROAs) 
     and other (non-certificate/CRL) signed objects

Internet-Draft  Template CPS for an Internet Registry    February 2007 
    

  . In the future, the PKI also may include end entity certificates in 
     support of access control for the repository system  

1.2. Document name and identification 

   The name of this document is "<Name of Registry>'s Certification 
   Practice Statement for the Internet IP Address and AS Number PKI".  

1.3. PKI participants 

   Note: In a PKI, the term "subscriber" refers to an individual or 
   organization that is a Subject of a certificate issued by a CA. The 
   term is used in this fashion throughout this document, without 
   qualification, and should not be confused with the networking use of 
   the term to refer to an individual or organization that receives 
   service from an LIR/ISP.  Thus, in this PKI, the term "subscriber" 
   can refer both to LIRs/ISPs, which can be subscribers of RIRs, NIRs, 
   and other LIRs, and also to organizations that are not ISPs, but 
   which are subscribers of ISPs in the networking sense of the term. 
   Also note that, for brevity, this document always refers to 
   subscribers as organizations, even though some subscribers are 
   individuals. When necessary, the phrase "network subscriber" is used 
   to refer to an organization that receives network services from an 
   LIR/ISP. 

1.3.1. Certification authorities 

   <Name of Registry>  will operate a CA, the primary function of which 
   is the issuance of certificates to organizations to which address 
   space or AS numbers are allocated by the registry. In the future, 
   this CA may also issue other types of end entity (EE) certificates, 
   e.g., EE certificates to operations personnel in support of 
   repository maintenance. 

1.3.2. Registration authorities 

   For the certificates issued by this registry under this PKI, this 
   function is provided by the registry per se. The registry already 
   performs this function -- establishing a formal relationship with 
   each subscriber and assuming responsibility for allocating and 
   tracking the current allocation of address space and AS numbers. 
   Since the registry operates the CA, there is no distinct RA.  

1.3.3. Subscribers 

   Two types of organizations receive allocations of IP addresses and 
   AS numbers from this CA and thus are subscribers in the PKI sense: 
   network subscribers and Internet Service Providers (ISPs).

Internet-Draft  Template CPS for an Internet Registry    February 2007 
    

   <Additionally, this CA issues certificates to <Local/National> 
   Registries (choose the right term for this RIR, if either applies) 
   who, in turn, issue certificates to network subscribers or 
   LIRs/ISPs.> 

1.3.4. Relying parties 

   Entities that need to validate claims of address space and/or AS 
   number current holdings are relying parties.  Thus, for example, 
   entities that make use of address and AS number allocation 
   certificates in support of improved routing security are relying 
   parties. Registries are relying parties because they transfer 
   resources between one another and thus will need to verify (cross) 
   certificates issued in conjunction with such transfers.  This 
   includes LIRs/ISPs, multi-homed organizations exchanging BGP [BGP4] 
   traffic with LIRs/ISPs, and subscribers who have received an 
   allocation of address space from one ISP or from a registry, but 
   want to authorize an (or another) LIR/ISP to originate routes to 
   this space.  

   To the extent that repositories make use of certificates for access 
   control - checking for authorization to upload certificate, CRL, and 
   ROA update packages -- they too act as relying parties. 

1.3.5. Other participants 

   <Name of Registry> will operate a repository that holds 
   certificates, CRLs, and other signed objects, e.g., ROAs. 

1.4. Certificate usage 

1.4.1. Appropriate certificate uses 

   The certificates issued under this hierarchy are for authorization 
   in support of validation of claims of current holdings of address 
   space and/or AS numbers, e.g., for routing security. With regard to 
   routing security, an initial goal of this PKI is to allow the holder 
   of a set of address blocks to be able to declare, in a secure 
   fashion, the AS number of each entity that is authorized to 
   originate a route to these addresses, including the context of ISP 
   proxy aggregation. Additional uses of the PKI, consistent with the 
   basic goal cited above, are also permitted under this policy. 

   Some of the certificates that may be issued under this hierarchy 
   could be used to support operation of this infrastructure, e.g., 
   access control for the repository system. Such uses also are 
   permitted under this policy.

1.4.2. Prohibited certificate uses 

   Any uses other than those described in Section 1.4.1 are prohibited. 

1.5. Policy administration 

1.5.1. Organization administering the document 

   This CPS is administered by <Name of Registry> 

1.5.2. Contact person 

   <Insert Registry contact info here> 

1.5.3. Person determining CPS suitability for the policy 

   Not applicable.  Each organization issuing a certificate in this PKI 
   is attesting to the allocation of resources (IP addresses, AS 
   numbers) to the holder of the private key corresponding to the 
   public key in the certificate. The issuing organizations are the 
   same organizations as the ones that perform the allocation hence 
   they are authoritative with respect to the accuracy of this binding.  

1.5.4. CPS approval procedures 

   Not applicable. Each organization issuing a certificate in this PKI 
   is attesting to the allocation of resources (IP addresses, AS 
   numbers) to the holder of the private key corresponding to the 
   public key in the certificate. The issuing organizations are the 
   same organizations as the ones that perform the allocation hence 
   they are authoritative with respect to the accuracy of this binding.  

1.6. Definitions and acronyms 

   CP -  Certificate Policy. A CP is a named set of rules that 
         indicates the applicability of a certificate to a particular 
         community and/or class of applications with common security 
         requirements. 

   CPS - Certification Practice Statement. A CPS is a document that 
         specifies the practices that a Certification Authority employs 
         in issuing certificates. 

   ISP - Internet Service Provider. An ISP is an organization managing 
         and selling Internet services to other organizations. 

   LIR - Local Internet Registry. This is an organization, typically a 
        network service provider, that sub-allocates the assignment of

        IP addresses for a portion of the area covered by a Regional 
        (or National) Registry.   

   NIR - National Internet Registry. An NIR is an organization that 
         manages the assignment of IP address and AS numbers for a 
         portion of the geopolitical area covered by a Regional 
         Registry. These form an optional second tier in the tree 
         scheme used to manage IP address and AS number allocation.  

   RIR - Regional Internet Registry.  An RIR is an organization that 
         manages the assignment of IP address and AS numbers for a 
         specified geopolitical area.  At present, there are five RIRs: 
         ARIN (North America), RIPE NCC (Europe), APNIC (Asia -
         Pacific), LACNIC (Latin America and Caribbean), and AFRINIC 
         (Africa).  

   ROA - Route Origination Authorization.  This is a digitally signed 
         object that identifies a network operator, identified by an 
         AS, that is authorized to originate routes to a specified set 
         of address blocks.

2. Publication And Repository Responsibilities 

2.1. Repositories 

   As per the CP, certificates and CRLs, will be made available for 
   downloading by all network operators, to enable them to validate 
   this data for use in support of routing security.  

   <Describe here the basic set up of your local repository system.> 

2.2. Publication of certification information 

   <Name of Registry> will upload certificates and CRLs issued by it to 
   a local repository system that operates as part of a world-wide 
   distributed system of repositories. 

2.3. Time or Frequency of Publication 

   <Describe here your procedures for publication (via the repository) 
   of the certificates and CRLs that you issue. If you choose to 
   outsource publication of PKI data, you still need to provide this 
   information for relying parties.>  

   As per the CP, the following standards exist for publication times 
   and frequency: 

   A certificate will be published within 24 hours after a CA has 
   received acknowledgement from the subject of the certificate that 
   the certificate is accurate.  

   The <Name of Registry> CA will publish its CRL prior to the 
   nextScheduledUpdate value in the scheduled CRL previously issued by 
   the CA. Within 24 hours of effecting revocation, the CA will publish 
   a CRL with an entry for the revoked certificate. 

2.4. Access controls on repositories  

   Access to the repository system, for modification of entries, must 
   be controlled to prevent denial of service attacks. All data 
   (certificates, CRLs and ROAs) uploaded to a repository are digitally 
   signed. Updates to the repository system must be validated to ensure 
   that the data being added or replaced is authorized. This document 
   does not define the means by which updates are verified, but use of 
   the PKI itself to validate updates is anticipated.

3. Identification And Authentication 

3.1. Naming 

3.1.1. Types of names 

   The Subject of each certificate issued by this Registry is 
   identified by an X.500 Disinguished Name (DN). For certificates 
   issued to LIRs/ISPs and subscribers, the Subject will consist of a 
   single CN attribute with a value generated by the issuer. For 
   certificates issued to an NIR, the Subject will be the name of the 
   NIR.  

3.1.2. Need for names to be meaningful 

   The Subject name in each subscriber certificate will be unique 
   relative to all certificates issued by <Name of LIR/ISP>. However, 
   there is no guarantee that the subject name will be globally unique 
   in this PKI. 

   Note: The name of the holder of an address block or AS number need 
   not to be "meaningful" in the conventional, human-readable sense, 
   since certificates issued under this PKI are used for authorization 
   in support of routing security, not for identification 

3.1.3. Anonymity or pseudonymity of subscribers 

   Although Subject names in certificates issued by this registry need 
   not be meaningful, and may appear "random," anonymity is not a 
   function of this PKI, and thus no explicit support for this feature 
   is provided. 

3.1.4. Rules for interpreting various name forms 

   None 

3.1.5. Uniqueness of names 

   <Name of Registry> certifies Subject names that are unique among the 
   certificates that it issues. Although it is desirable that these 
   Subject names be unique throughout the PKI, to facilitate 
   certificate path discovery, such uniqueness is neither mandated nor 
   enforced through technical means.

Internet-Draft  Template CPS for an Internet Registry    February 2007 
    

3.1.6. Recognition, authentication, and role of trademarks 

   Because the Subject names are not intended to be meaningful, there 
   is no provision to recognize nor authenticate trademarks, service 
   marks, etc. 

3.2. Initial identity validation 

3.2.1. Method to prove possession of private key 

   <Describe the method whereby each subscriber will be required to 
   demonstrate proof-of-possession (PoP) of the private key 
   corresponding to the public key in the certificate, prior to issuing 
   the certificate. Standard methods are described in the Certificate 
   Management Protocol (CMP) (RFC 2510) and the Certificate Management 
   Messages over CMS protocol (CMC), RFC 2797.> 

3.2.2. Authentication of organization identity 

   Certificates issued under this PKI do not attest to the 
   organizational identity of resource holders, with the exception of 
   registries. However, certificates are issued to resource holders in 
   a fashion that preserves the accuracy of bindings in this registry's 
   records.  

    <Describe the procedures that will be used to ensure that each 
   certificate that is issued accurately reflects your records with 
   regard to the organization to which you have allocated (or sub-
   allocated) the address space (or AS numbers) identified in the 
   certificate. The specific procedures employed for this purpose 
   should be commensurate with those you already employ as a registry 
   in the maintenance of address (and AS number) allocation.> 

3.2.3. Authentication of individual identity 

   Certificates issued under this PKI do not attest to the individual 
   identity of a resource holder. However, this registry maintains 
   contact information for each resource holder in support of 
   certificate renewal, re-key, or revocation.  

   <Describe the procedures that will be used to identify at least one 
   individual as a representative of each organization that is an 
   address space (or AS number) holder. This is done in support of 
   issuance, renewal, and revocation of the certificate issued to the 
   organization. The procedures should be commensurate with those you 
   already employ in authenticating individuals as representatives for 
   address space (or AS number) holders. Note that this authentication 
   is solely for use by you in dealing with the organizations to which 
 
 
Kong, Seo & Kent         Expires August 2007                 [Page 17] 

Internet-Draft  Template CPS for an Internet Registry    February 2007 
    

   you allocate (or sub-allocate) address space (or AS numbers), and 
   thus must not be relied upon outside of this CA-subscriber 
   relationship.> 

3.2.4. Non-verified subscriber information 

   No non-verified subscriber data is included in certificates issued 
   under this certificate policy. 

3.2.5. Validation of authority 

   <Describe the procedures that will be used to verify that an 
   individual claiming to represent a resource holder to which a 
   certificate is issued, is authorized to represent that resource 
   holder in this context.  The procedures should be commensurate with 
   those you already employ as a registry in authenticating individuals 
   as representatives of resource holders.> 

3.2.6. Criteria for interoperation 

   This PKI is neither intended nor designed to interoperate with any 
   other PKI.  

3.3. Identification and authentication for re-key requests 

3.3.1. Identification and authentication for routine re-key 

   <Describe the procedures that will be used to ensure that an 
   organization requesting a re-key is the legitimate holder of the 
   certificate (and associated address space and AS numbers) to be re-
   keyed.  This should also include the method employed for verifying 
   PoP of the private key corresponding to the new public key.   With 
   respect to authentication of the holder of the address space and AS 
   numbers, the procedures should be commensurate with those you 
   already employ in the maintenance of address (and AS number) 
   allocation.  Note that your organization can choose to require 
   periodic re-keying consistent with contractual agreements with the 
   recipient.> 

3.3.2. Identification and authentication for re-key after revocation 

   <Describe the procedures that will be used to ensure that an 
   organization requesting a re-key after revocation is the legitimate 
   holder of the address space and AS numbers in the certificate being 
   re-keyed. This should also include the method employed for verifying 
   PoP of the private key corresponding to the new public key. Note 
   that there may be different procedures for the case where the 
   legitimate subject still possesses the original private key as 
 
 
Kong, Seo & Kent         Expires August 2007                 [Page 18] 

Internet-Draft  Template CPS for an Internet Registry    February 2007 
    

   opposed to the case when it no longer has access to that key.  With 
   respect to authentication of the resource holder, the procedures 
   should be commensurate with those you already employ in the 
   maintenance of resource allocation records.> 

3.4. Identification and authentication for revocation request 

   <Describe the procedures that will be used to ensure that the 
   resource holder requesting revocation is the subject of the 
   certificate (or an authorized representative thereof) to be revoked. 
   Note that there may be different procedures for the case where the 
   legitimate subject still possesses the original private key as 
   opposed to the case when the subject no longer has access to that 
   key. These procedures should be commensurate with those you already 
   employ in the maintenance of resource holder records.> 

   Note:  If additional IP addresses or AS numbers are being added to 
   an organization's existing allocation, the old certificate need not 
   be revoked. Instead, a new certificate may be issued with both the 
   old and the new resources and the old key.  If IP addresses or AS 
   numbers are being removed or if there has been a key compromise, 
   then the old certificate will be a revoked (and a re-key will be 
   performed in the event of a key compromise). A subscriber may 
   request that its resource holdings be spread over a set of 
   certificates, rather than consolidating all resources in one 
   certificate. This may be appropriate if the subscriber wants to 
   manage his resource allocations as distinct allocations within his 
   organization.

4. Certificate Life-Cycle Operational Requirements  

4.1. Certificate Application 

4.1.1. Who can submit a certificate application 

   The following entities may submit a certificate application to this 
   CA: 

     o <Insert if appropriate: "Any NIR or LIR/ISP operating in the 
        geopolitical region served by this registry">  

     o Any entity that holds AS numbers or address space assigned by 
        this registry 

4.1.2. Enrollment process and responsibilities 

   <Describe your enrollment process for issuing certificates both for 
   initial deployment of the PKI and as an ongoing process. Note that 
   most of the certificates in this PKI are issued as part of registry 
   and ISP normal business practices, as an adjunct to address space 
   and AS number allocation, and thus a separate application to request 
   a certificate may not be necessary.  If so, reference should be made 
   to where these practices are documented.> 

4.2. Certificate application processing 

   <Describe the certificate request/response standards that you will 
   employ.  You should make use of existing standards for certificate 
   application processing.  Relevant standards include RFC 4210, 
   Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate Management 
   Protocol (CMP), RFC 2797, Certificate Management Messages over CMS, 
   and RSA Labs standards PKCS #7 and PKCS #10. >  

4.2.1. Performing identification and authentication functions 

   <Describe your practices for identification and authentication of 
   certificate applicants.  Often, existing practices employed by you 
   to identify and authenticate organizations form the basis for 
   issuance of certificates to these subscribers.  Reference can be 
   made to documentation of such existing practices.> 

4.2.2. Approval or rejection of certificate applications 

   <Describe your practices for approval or rejection of applications 
   and refer to documentation of existing business practices relevant 
   to this process.  Note that according to the CP, certificate 
   applications will be approved based on the normal business practices

   of the entity operating the CA, based on the CA's records of address 
   space and AS number holders. Also, each CA will verify that the 
   requester holds the corresponding private key for the public key 
   that will be bound to the certificate the CA issues to the 
   requester.> 

4.2.3. Time to process certificate applications 

   <You may declare here your expected time frame for processing 
   certificate applications.> 

4.3. Certificate issuance 

4.3.1. CA actions during certificate issuance 

   <Describe in this section the following (referring to subsequent 
   sections as appropriate): 

   Procedures for generation of a draft certificate and form of the 
   draft. Typically a draft certificate is a complete certificate 
   except for the issuer's signature. 

   Procedure for making the draft available to the applicant for 
   review. For example, you may directly transmit the draft certificate 
   to the subscriber (applying PKCS #7 or other defined syntax).  
   Alternatively, you might establish a repository where draft 
   certificates can be examined. 

   Procedure for subscriber approval/rejection of the draft (Section 
   4.4.1) 

   If the draft is approved, procedure for finalization of the draft 
   and subsequent publication (Section 4.4.2) 

   If the draft is rejected, procedure for modification of the rejected 
   certificate (Section 4.8 might be useful) or submission of a new 
   certificate request.> 

4.3.2. Notification to subscriber by the CA of issuance of certificate 

   <Describe your procedure for notification of a subscriber when a 
   draft certificate is ready for review.> 

   Notification of certificate issuance by the CA to other entities 
   [OMITTED>

4.4. Certificate acceptance 

4.4.1. Conduct constituting certificate acceptance 

   When a draft certificate is generated and the subscriber is 
   notified, it is required that the subscriber review the proposed 
   certificate and either approve or reject it within <X - This should 
   be 30 or fewer as per the CP> days. <Describe what constitutes 
   acceptance or rejection from the certificate applicant.> 

   If a certificate remains unprocessed by the requester after <X> 
   days, <Describe your policy for handling certificates that have not 
   been acknowledged (either positively or negatively) after X days.  
   For example, at your option, you may either cancel the certificate 
   or finalize it and place it in the repository.> 

4.4.2. Publication of the certificate by the CA 

   Certificates will be published in the Repository system once 
   approved. <Describe your procedures for publication of the approved 
   certificate.> 

4.5. Key pair and certificate usage 

   A summary of the use model for the IP Address and AS Number PKI is 
   provided below.  

4.5.1. Subscriber private key and certificate usage 

   The certificates issued by this registry to resource holders are CA 
   certificates. The private key associated with each of these 
   certificates is used to sign subordinate (CA or EE) certificates and 
   CRLs. A subscriber will issue certificates to any organizations to 
   which it allocates IP address space and one or more "shadow" 
   certificates for use in verifying signatures on ROAs signed by the 
   subscriber. <If appropriate, add "Subscribers that are NIRs issue 
   certificates to organizations to which they have allocated address 
   space or AS numbers.  Subscribers that are LIRs issue certificates 
   to organizations to which they have allocated address space."> 
   Subscribers also will issue certificates to operators in support of 
   repository access control.  

4.5.2. Relying party public key and certificate usage 

   The primary relying parties in this PKI are LIRs/ISPs, who will use 
   shadow certificates to verify ROAs, e.g., in support of generating 
   route filters.  Repositories will use operator certificates to 
   verify the authorization of entities to engage in repository

   maintenance activities, and thus repositories represent a secondary 
   type of relying party. 

4.6. Certificate renewal 

4.6.1. Circumstance for certificate renewal 

   As per the CP, a certificate will be processed for renewal based on 
   its expiration date or a renewal request from the certificate 
   Subject. The request may be implicit, a side effect of renewing its 
   resource holding agreement, or may be explicit. If <Name of 
   Registry> initiates the renewal process based on the certificate 
   expiration date, then <Name of Registry> will notify the resource  
   holder <insert the period of advance warning, e.g., "2 weeks in 
   advance of the expiration date", or the general policy, e.g., "in 
   conjunction with notification of service expiration".>  The validity 
   interval of the new (renewed) certificate will overlap that of the 
   previous certificate by <insert length of overlap period, e.g., 1 
   week>, to ensure uninterrupted coverage.  

   Certificate renewal will incorporate the same public key as the 
   previous certificate, unless the private key has been reported as 
   compromised.  If a new key pair is being used, the stipulations of 
   Section 4.7 will apply. 

4.6.2. Who may request renewal 

   The certificate holder or <Name of Registry> may initiate the 
   renewal process. <For the case of the certificate holder, describe 
   what steps will be taken to verify the identity and authorization of 
   the entity requesting the renewal.> 

4.6.3. Processing certificate renewal requests 

   <Describe your procedures for handling certificate renewal requests.  
   This must include verification that the certificate in question has 
   not been revoked.>  

4.6.4. Notification of new certificate issuance to subscriber 

   <Describe your procedure for notification of new certificate 
   issuance to the subscriber. This should be consistent with 4.3.2.> 

4.6.5. Conduct constituting acceptance of a renewal certificate 

   <Describe your definition of what constitutes acceptance of a 
   renewed certificate. This should be consistent with 4.4.1.>

4.6.6. Publication of the renewal certificate by the CA 

   <Describe your policy and procedures for publication of a renewed 
   certificate. This should be consistent with 4.4.2.> 

4.6.7. Notification of certificate issuance by the CA to other entities 
[OMITTED] 
    

4.7. Certificate re-key 

4.7.1. Circumstance for certificate re-key 

   As per the CP, re-key of a certificate will be performed only when 
   requested, based on: 

  (1) knowledge or suspicion of compromise or loss of the associated 
     private key, or  

  (2) the expiration of the cryptographic lifetime of the associated 
     key pair  

   If a certificate is revoked to replace the RFC 3779 extensions, the 
   replacement certificate will incorporate the same public key, not a 
   new key, unless the subscriber requests a re-key at the same time. 

   If the re-key is based on a suspected compromise, then the previous 
   certificate will be revoked.  

   Section 5.6 of the Certificate Policy notes that when a CA signs a 
   certificate, the signing key should have a validity period that 
   exceeds the validity period of the certificate.  This places 
   additional constraints on when a CA should request a re-key. 

4.7.2. Who may request certification of a new public key 

   The holder of the certificate may request a re-key. In addition, 
   <Name of Registry> may initiate a re-key based on a verified 
   compromise report. <Describe what steps will be taken to verify the 
   identity and authorization of a subscriber to request a re-key when 
   the private key has been reported as compromised. Also describe how 
   a compromise report received from other than a subscriber is 
   verified.>

4.7.3. Processing certificate re-keying requests 

   <Describe your process for handling re-keying requests.  As per the 
   CP, this should be consistent with the process described in Section 
   4.3.  So reference can be made to that section.> 

4.7.4. Notification of new certificate issuance to subscriber 

   <Describe your policy regarding notifying the subscriber re: 
   availability of the new certificate.  This should be consistent with 
   the notification process for any new certificate issuance (see 
   section 4.3.2).> 

4.7.5. Conduct constituting acceptance of a re-keyed certificate 

   <Describe your policy regarding acceptance of the new certificate by 
   the subscriber.  This should be consistent with the acceptance 
   process for any new certificate (see section 4.4.1).> 

4.7.6. Publication of the re-keyed certificate by the CA 

   <Describe your policy regarding publication of the new certificate.  
   This should be consistent with the publication process for any new 
   certificate (see section 4.4.2).> 

4.7.7. Notification of certificate issuance by the CA to other entities 
[OMITTED] 
    

4.8. Certificate modification 

4.8.1. Circumstance for certificate modification 

   As per the CP, modification of a certificate occurs to implement 
   changes to the RFC 3779 extension values in a certificate.  A 
   subscriber can request a certificate modification when this 
   information in a currently valid certificate has changed, as a 
   result of changes in the resource holdings of the subscriber. The 
   request may be implicit, a side effect of the allocation of 
   additional resources, or may be explicit.  A subscriber also may 
   request that its existing set of resources be redistributed among 
   multiple certificates. This example of certificate modification is 
   effected through issuance of new certificates, and revocation of the 
   previous certificates. 

   If a subscriber is to be allocated address space or AS numbers in 
   addition to a current allocation, and if the subscriber does not 
   request that a new certificate be issued containing only these 
 
 
Kong, Seo & Kent         Expires August 2007                 [Page 25] 

Internet-Draft  Template CPS for an Internet Registry    February 2007 
    

   resources, then this is accomplished through a certificate 
   modification. When a certificate modification is approved, a new 
   certificate is issued.  The new certificate will contain the same 
   public key and the same expiration date as the original certificate, 
   but with the incidental information corrected and/or the address 
   space and AS allocations expanded. When previously allocated address 
   space or AS numbers are to be removed from a certificate, then the 
   old certificate MUST be revoked and a new certificate (reflecting 
   the new allocation) issued.  

4.8.2. Who may request certificate modification 

   The certificate holder or <Name of Registry> may initiate the 
   certificate modification process. <For the case of the certificate 
   holder, state here what steps will be taken to verify the identity 
   and authorization of the entity requesting the modification.> 

4.8.3. Processing certificate modification requests 

   <Describe your procedures for verification of the modification 
   request and procedures for the issuance of a new certificate.  These 
   should be consistent with the processes described in Sections 4.2 
   and 4.3.1.> 

4.8.4. Notification of modified certificate issuance to subscriber 

   <Describe your procedure for notification of issuance of a modified 
   certificate.  This should be consistent with the notification 
   process for any new certificate (see section 4.3.2).> 

4.8.5. Conduct constituting acceptance of modified certificate 

   <Describe your criteria for acceptance of a modified certificate.  
   This should be consistent with the acceptance process for any new 
   certificate (see section 4.4.1).> 

4.8.6. Publication of the modified certificate by the CA 

   <Describe your procedure for publication of a modified certificate.  
   This should be consistent with the publication process for any new 
   certificate (see section 4.4.2).> 

4.8.7. Notification of certificate issuance by the CA to other entities

4.9. Certificate revocation and suspension 

4.9.1. Circumstances for revocation 

   As per the CP, certificates can be revoked for several reasons.  
   Either <Name of Registry> or the subject may choose to end the 
   relationship expressed in the certificate, thus creating cause to 
   revoke the certificate. If one or more of the resources bound to the 
   public key in the certificate are no longer associated with the 
   subject, that too constitutes a basis for revocation.  A certificate 
   also may be revoked due to loss or compromise of the private key 
   corresponding to the public key in the certificate.  Finally, a 
   certificate may be revoked in order to invalidate data signed by 
   that certificate.   

4.9.2. Who can request revocation 

   The certificate holder or <Name of Registry> may request a 
   revocation. <For the case of the certificate holder, describe what 
   steps will be taken to verify the identity and authorization of the 
   entity requesting the revocation.> 

4.9.3. Procedure for revocation request 

   <Describe your process for handling a certificate revocation 
   request.  This should include:  

   Procedure to be used by the certificate holder to request a 
   revocation 

   Procedure for notification of the certificate holder when the CRL is 
   published by <Name of Registry>. 

4.9.4. Revocation request grace period 

   A subscriber should request revocation as soon as possible after the 
   need for revocation has been identified.  

4.9.5. Time within which CA must process the revocation request 

   <Describe your policy on the time period within which you will 
   process a revocation request.> 

4.9.6. Revocation checking requirement for relying parties 

   As per the CP, a relying party is responsible for acquiring and 
   checking the most recent, scheduled CRL from the issuer of the 
   certificate, whenever the relying party validates a certificate.

4.9.7. CRL issuance frequency  

   <Name of Registry> will publish CRLs approximately every 24 hours.  
   Each CRL will carry a nextScheduledUpdate value and a new CRL will 
   be published at or before that time.  <Name of Registry> will set 
   the nextScheduledUpdate value when it issues a CRL, to signal when 
   the next scheduled CRL will be issued. 

4.9.8. Maximum latency for CRLs  

   A CRL will be posted to the repository system with minimal delay 
   after generation.

6. Technical Security Controls 

   This section describes the security controls used by <Name of 
   Registry>.  

6.1. Key pair generation and installation 

6.1.1. Key pair generation 

   <Describe the procedures that will be used to generate the CA key 
   pair, and, if applicable, key pairs for network subscribers.  In 
   most instances, public-key pairs will be generated by the 
   subscriber, i.e., the organization receiving the allocation of 
   address space or AS numbers.  However, your procedures may include 
   one for generating key pairs on behalf of your subscribers if they 
   so request. (This might be done for subscribers who do not have the 
   ability to perform key generation in a secure fashion or who want a 
   registry to provide backup for the subscriber private key.) Since 
   the keys used in this PKI are not for non-repudiation purposes, 
   generation of key pairs by CAs does not inherently undermine the 
   security of the PKI. > 

6.1.2. Private key delivery to subscriber 

   <If the procedures in 6.1.1 include providing key pair generation 
   services for subscribers, describe the means by which private keys 
   are delivered to subscribers in a secure fashion. Otherwise say this 
   is not applicable.> 

6.1.3. Public key delivery to certificate issuer 

   <Describe the means by which the public keys are delivered to you, 
   e.g., electronic submission using a PKCS#10 Certificate Signing 
   Request (CSR).  This description should explain how this public key 
   delivery fits in with the process whereby the subscriber requests IP 
   address space (and/or AS numbers), authenticates itself, pays for 
   the resources, etc. The security of the procedures used by a 
   subscriber to deliver its public key to you need only be 
   commensurate with the security of the procedures already employed 
   for management of the IP address space and AS numbers.> 

6.1.4. CA public key delivery to relying parties 

   CA public keys for all entities other than RIRs are contained in 
   certificates issued by other CAs. These certificates plus 
   certificates used to represent inter-RIR transfers of address space 
   or AS numbers will be published via a repository system. Relying 
   parties will download these certificates from this system. Public

   key values and associated data for the trust anchors (RIRs) will be 
   distributed out of band, e.g., embedded in path validation software 
   that will be made available to the Internet community. 

6.1.5. Key sizes 

   For the <Name of Registry> CA's certificate and shadow CA 
   certificate, the RSA key size will be 2048 bits. For subscriber 
   certificates, the RSA keys will be <insert key size -- e.g., 2048 or 
   1024 bits. If NIR key size is larger than LIR/ISP/subscriber key 
   size, describe each independently.>   

6.1.6. Public key parameters generation and quality checking 

   The RSA algorithm [RSA] is used in this PKI with the public exponent 
   (e) F4 (65,537).  

   <If the procedures in 6.1.1 include subscriber key pair generation, 
   insert here text specifying that the subscriber is responsible for 
   performing checks on the quality of its key pair and saying that 
   <Name of Registry> is not responsible for performing such checks for 
   subscribers OR describe the procedures used by the CA for checking 
   the quality of these subscriber key pairs.> 

6.1.7. Key usage purposes (as per X.509 v3 key usage field) 

   The Key usage extension bit values will be consistent with RFC 3280. 
   For <Name of Registry>'s CA certificates, the keyCertSign and 
   cRLSign bits will be set TRUE. All other bits (including 
   digitalSignature) will be set FALSE, and the extension will be 
   marked critical.  

6.2. Private Key Protection and Cryptographic Module Engineering 
     Controls 

6.2.1. Cryptographic module standards and controls 

   The <Name of Registry> CA employs a cryptographic module evaluated 
   under FIPS 140-2, at level 3 [FIPS].  

6.2.2. Private key (n out of m) multi-person control 

   There will be private key <insert here n> out of <insert here m> 
   multi-person control.  

6.2.3. Private key escrow 

   No private key escrow procedures are required for this PKI.

6.2.4. Private key backup 

   <Describe the procedures used for backing up your CA's private key.  
   The following aspects should be included. (1) The copying should be 
   done under the same multi-party control as is used for controlling 
   the original private key.  (2) At least one copy should be kept at 
   an off-site location for disaster recovery purposes.> 

6.2.5. Private key archival 

   See sections 6.2.3 and 6.2.4 

6.2.6. Private key transfer into or from a cryptographic module 

   The private keys for <Name of Registry>'s CA and shadow CA will be 
   generated by the cryptographic module specified in 6.2.1.  The 
   private keys will never leave the module except in encrypted form 
   for backup and/or transfer to a new module. 

6.2.7. Private key storage on cryptographic module 

   The private keys for <Name of Registry>'s CA will be stored in the 
   cryptographic module and will be protected from unauthorized use in 
   accordance with the FIPS 140-2 requirements applicable to the 
   module. (See [FIPS]) 

6.2.8. Method of activating private key 

   <Describe the mechanisms and data used to activate your CA's private 
   key.> 

6.2.9. Method of deactivating private key 

   The cryptographic module, when activated, will not be left 
   unattended.  After use, it will be deactivated by <Describe the 
   procedure for deactivation of your CA's private key.> The module 
   will be stored securely when not in use. 

6.2.10. Method of destroying private key 

   <Describe the method used for destroying your CA's private key, 
   e.g., when it is superseded.  This will depend on the particular 
   module.> 

6.2.11. Cryptographic Module Rating 

   The cryptographic module will be certified FIPS 140-2, at level 3 
   [FIPS].

6.3. Other aspects of key pair management 

6.3.1. Public key archival 

   Because this PKI does not support non-repudiation, there is no need 
   to archive public keys. 

6.3.2. Certificate operational periods and key pair usage periods 

   The <Name of Registry> CA's key pair will have a validity interval 
   of <insert number of years - Registry key pairs and certificates 
   should have long validity intervals, e.g., 10 years, to minimize the 
   disruption caused by key changeover for top tier CAs.>   

6.4. Activation data 

6.4.1. Activation data generation and installation 

   <Describe how activation data for your CA will be generated.>

10. Security Considerations 

   The degree to which a relying party can trust the binding embodied 
   in a certificate depends on several factors.  These factors can 
   include the practices followed by the certification authority (CA) 
   in authenticating the subject; the CA's operating policy, 
   procedures, and technical security controls, including the scope of 
   the subscriber's responsibilities (for example, in protecting the 
   private key), and the stated responsibilities and liability terms 
   and conditions of the CA (for example, warranties, disclaimers of 
   warranties, and limitations of liability). This document provides a 
   framework to address the technical, procedural, personnel, and 
   physical security aspects of Certification Authorities, Registration 
   Authorities, repositories, subscribers, and relying party 
   cryptographic modules, in order to ensure that the certificate 
   generation, publication, renewal, re-key, usage, and revocation is 
   done in a secure manner.  Specifically, Section 3 Identification and 
   Authentication (I&A); Section 4 Certificate Life-Cycle Operational 
   Requirements; Section 5 Facility Management, and Operational 
   Controls; Section 6 Technical Security Controls; Section 7 
   Certificate and CRL Profiles; and Section 8 Compliance Audit and 
   Other Assessments are oriented towards ensuring secure operation of 
   the PKI entities such as CA, RA, repository, subscriber systems, and 
   relying party systems. 

11. IANA Considerations 

   None.
