Internet-Draft           The 'xmlns:' URI Scheme            January 2002


1. Overview

   The 'xmlns:' URI scheme is intended to provide a simple but
   consistent means by which XML Namespaces [2] can be reified, and
   which also provides for the association of a namespace prefix with a
   given namespace.

   The 'xmlns:' URI scheme belongs to the class of URIs known as Uniform
   Resource Values (URV) which are themselves a subclass of Uniform
   Resource Primitives (URP), a class of URI which constitutes a
   "WYSIWYG" URI, one which is not dereferencible to and does not denote
   another web resource, but constitutes a self-contained resource where
   the full realization of that resource is expressed in the URI itself.
   For a full discussion of the properties of URPs and URVs, please see
   [1].  Familiarity with the concepts defined therein will facilitate
   the full understanding of this document.

   Because a URP is not dereferencible, and hence does not permit the
   suffixation of a fragment identifier (there is no such thing as a URP
   Reference), it is not necessary to escape any hash marks '#'
   occurring in the namespace URI Reference part of a 'xmlns:' URI.

   Examples:

      xmlns:rdf:http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#
      xmlns:rdfs:http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#
      xmlns:xsd:http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#
      xmlns:lang:voc://iso.ch/639/
      xmlns:*:http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#
      xmlns:*:voc://-/f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6/
      xmlns:*:mailto:john.doe@abc.com

   These examples are provided for illustrative purposes only and do not
   necessarily constitute actual URIs.  See the BNF definition below for
   an explicit definition of 'xmlns:' URI syntax.

2. BNF for the 'xmlns:' URI Scheme

   This is a BNF-like description of the 'xmlns:' Uniform Resource
   Identifier syntax, using the conventions of RFC 822[3], except that
   "|" is used to designate alternatives, and brackets [] are used
   around optional or repeated elements.  Briefly, literals are quoted
   with "", optional elements are enclosed in [brackets], and elements
   may be preceded with <n>* to designate n or more repetitions of the
   following element; n defaults to 0.

   This BNF description adopts sub-definitions defined in RFC 2396
   "Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax" [4] and the W3C

Internet-Draft           The 'xmlns:' URI Scheme            January 2002


   Recommendation REC-xml-names "Namespaces in XML" [2] which are not
   repeated here.


   xmlns-URI      = "xmlns:" prefix ":" namespace
   prefix         = "*" | NCName
   namespace      = absoluteURI [ "#" fragment ]

   NCName         = <as defined by W3C REC-xml-names>
   absoluteURI    = <as defined by RFC 2396>
   fragment       = <as defined by RFC 2396>


   An asterisk "*" in the prefix field of an 'xmlns:' URI indicates that
   no specific prefix is specified and the 'xmlns:' URI reifies the
   namespace alone.

   Note that the URI scheme prefix "xmlns:" is considered to be a valid
   URI denoting this URI scheme, though it is not itself a valid URI
   according to this URI scheme.

3. Security Considerations

   This document raises no known security issues.
