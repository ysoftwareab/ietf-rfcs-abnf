Abstract

     This document describes a mechanism of generating a unique domain
     name based on Network Device Identifier. This mechanism is useful
     when we configure a unique domain name of a node automatically in
     the environment where there is no dedicated name server such as
     unmanaged home-network and ad-hoc network.

1. Introduction

     This document describes a simple mechanism which generates a unique
     domain name for a node in home-network or ad-hoc network where
     there is no network manager. This mechanism is useful when we
     configure a unique domain name of a node automatically in the
     environment where there is no dedicated name server and network
     manager such as unmanaged home-network and ad-hoc network.


2. Mechanism Overview

     This mechanism for name generation makes a unique domain name with
     user-id, device-id (network device's address extended into EUI-64)
     and domain like Figure 1 [1].


      ----------------------------------------------
      |   user-id   |   device-id   |    domain    |
      ----------------------------------------------

      Figure 1. Format of domain name


     user-id is the user identifier selected by user and device-id is
     EUI-64 identifier derived from the network device's built-in 48-bit
     IEEE 802 address [1]. Domain SHOULD include "EUI-64" sub-domain
     which indicates that the domain name is based on EUI-64.  We define
     the domain for ad-hoc network as EUI-64.ADHOC and the domain for
     home-network as EUI-64.HOMENET.

     For example, when user-id is "PAUL", device-id is "36-56-78-FF-FE-
     9A-BC-DE", and domain is "EUI-64.ADHOC", a unique domain name would
     be "PAUL.36-56-78-FF-FE-9A-BC-DE.EUI-64.ADHOC" [2].

     The merit of the above mechanism guarantees that no name conflict
     happens although users in other nodes use the same user-id.

     For example, like Figure 2, there are node A, B and C in the same
     subnet and they all use the same user-id, "PAUL". Their domain is
     "EUI-64.ADHOC". The domain name of each node is made through Table
     1. The domain name "NAME1" is for node A, the domain name "NAME2"
     is for node B. When node C generates its domain name on the basis
     of its user-id "PAUL" and its network device address "MAC3". Though
     node C uses the same user-id as node A and B, it can configure a
     unique domain name owing to the difference of network device
     address without the procedure of verifying the uniqueness of domain

      -----------------------------------------------------------------
      | NAME3  |  PAUL  |        MAC3        |  EUI64-3  |EUI-64.ADHOC|
      |(Node C)|        |                    |           |            |
      -----------------------------------------------------------------

      Table 1. Configuration of domain names of nodes in Figure 2


     Generally nodes can configure their unique domain name regardless
     of their user-id but name conflict might happen if the manaul
     configuration of MAC address is allowed. Verifying if the generated
     name is unique in the unmanaged network MAY be performed through
     dynamic update request [3][4]. When a name conflict happens, we
     SHOULD generate a new name of which device-id is EUI-64 identifier
     derived from 48-bit random number.  This new name SHOULD also be
     verified through dynamic update request.

     For example, Figure 3 shows the procedure of managing the name
     conflict. There are node A, B and C in the same subnet. Node A
     tries to configure its name as NAME1 which is the name of node B.

                    { Node C generates a new name "NAME3",
                           where NAME3: PAUL+MAC3         }

       DNS-UPDATE request <--------- ---------> DNS-UPDATE request
           (C, NAME3)                                (C, NAME3)

                               no response

      Figure 3. Management of name conflict


     Node C makes a new name "NAME2" on the basis of its network device
     identifier and verifies the uniqueness of the new name through
     dynamic update request in multicast [3][4]. Because node B finds
     that any other node, node C, tries to use its domain name, it sends
     node C DNS-UPDATE response indicating that NAME2 is used by node B.
     As node C receives node B's response, it makes a new name on the
     basis of a new device-id which is derived from a new network device
     identifier "MAC3", 48-bit random number. Node C verifies the
     uniqueness of the new one through dynamic update request again.
     Because in this time there is no response from any other node, node
     C configures the verified name as its domain name.


3. Implementation Considerations

     user-id and domain are registered in options statement of
     configuration file of name server as follows;

          options {

          user-id "PAUL";

          domain "EUI-64.ADHOC";

          };

     The generated domain name is registered in name server's zone file.


4. Security Considerations

     As network device identifier is exposed in domain name, there would
     be security attack. To prevent the attack, we SHOULD use the
     mechanism suggested in RFC3041 [5].
