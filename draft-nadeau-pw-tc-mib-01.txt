2.0 Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines Textual Conventions used in IETF PW and PW-
   related MIBs.
   
   Comments should be made directly to the MPLS mailing list at
   pwe3@ietf.org.
   
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [BCP14].
   
   For an introduction to the concepts of Pseudo-Wires, see [PWREQ] and
   [PWFRM].
   
3.0 Terminology

   This document uses terminology from the document describing the
   Pseudo-Wires Requirements [PWE3REQ].
   
4.0 The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:
   
   -  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [SNMPArch].
   
   -  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
   purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
   Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in RFC
   1155 [SMIv1], RFC 1212 [SNMPv1MIBDef] and RFC 1215 [SNMPv1Traps].
   The second version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [SMIv2],
   RFC 1903 [SNMPv2TC] and RFC 1904 [SNMPv2Conf].
   
   -  Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
   first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
   described in RFC 1157 [SNMPv1].  A second version of the SNMP message
   protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
   called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [SNMPv2c] and RFC 1906
   [SNMPv2TM].  The third version of the message protocol is called
   SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [SNMPv2TM], RFC 2272 [SNMPv3MP] and
   RFC 2574 [SNMPv3USM].
   
   -  Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The

   first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
   described in RFC 1157 [SNMPv1].  A second set of protocol operations
   and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [SNMPv2PO].
   
   -  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273
   [SNMPv3App] and the view-based access control mechanism described in
   RFC 2575 [SNMPv3VACM].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].
   
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.
   
   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

6.0 Security Considerations
   
   This memo defines textual conventions and object identities for use
   in MPLS MIB modules. Security issues for these MIB modules are
   addressed in the memos defining those modules.
