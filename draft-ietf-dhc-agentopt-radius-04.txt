Abstract

   A network access device may choose to authenticate the identity of a
   device before granting that device access to the network.  The IEEE
   802.1X protocol is an example of a mechanism for providing
   authenticated layer 2 network access.  A network element using RADIUS
   as an authentication authority will receive attributes from a RADIUS
   server that may be used by a DHCP server in the selection of an IP
   address for assignment to the device through its DHCP client. The
   RADIUS Attributes sub-option enables a network element to pass along
   attributes for the user of a device received during RADIUS
   authentication to a DHCP server.

Internet-Draft        RADIUS Attributes Sub-Option         February 2004


1. Introduction and Background

   The RADIUS Attributes sub-option for the DHCP Relay Agent option
   provides a way through which network elements can pass information
   obtained through layer 2 authentication to a DHCP server [2].  IEEE
   802.1X [3] is an example of a mechanism through which a network
   access device such as a switch or a wireless LAN access point can
   authenticate the identity of the user of a device before providing
   layer 2 network access using RADIUS [4] as the Authentication Service
   specified in 802.1X.  In 802.1X authenticated access, a device must
   first exchange some authentication credentials with the network
   access device.  The access device then supplies these credentials to
   a RADIUS server, which either confirms or denies the identity of the
   user of the device requesting network access.  The access device,
   based on the reply of the RADIUS server, then allows or denies
   network access to the requesting device.

   Figure 1 summarizes the message exchange among the participants in
   IEEE 802.1X authentication.

Internet-Draft        RADIUS Attributes Sub-Option         February 2004


   Figure 1

                                Figure 1

   In the application described in this document, the access device acts
   as an 802.1X authenticator and adds DHCP relay agent options to DHCP
   messages. During 802.1X authentication, the reply message from the
   RADIUS server carries additional identification information as
   attributes to the access device. The access device stores these
   attributes locally. When the access device subsequently forwards DHCP
   messages from the network device, the access device adds the
   identification information in an RADIUS Attributes sub-option.  The
   RADIUS Attributes sub-option is another suboption of the Relay Agent
   Information option [5].

   This document uses IEEE 802.1X as an example to motivate the use of
   RADIUS by an access device.  The RADIUS Attributes sub-option
   described in this document is not limited to use in conjunction with
   IEEE 802.1X and can be used to carry RADIUS attributes obtained by
   the relay agent for any reason.

2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

2.1 General Terminology

   Access device:  A network element providing network access to a host


2.2 DHCP Terminology

   The following terms are used as defined in RFC2131 and RFC3046: DHCP
   relay agent, DHCP server, DHCP client.

2.3 RADIUS Terminology

   The following terms are used in conjunction with RADIUS:

   RADIUS server: An entity that provides RADIUS service through the
      exchange of RADIUS protocol messages

   Attribute: Data value carried in a RADIUS protocol message

Internet-Draft        RADIUS Attributes Sub-Option         February 2004


2.4 802.1X Terminology

   The following terms are used as defined in the IEEE 802.1X protocol:
   Authenticator, Supplicant.

3. RADIUS Attributes sub-option format

   The RADIUS Attributes Sub-option is a new sub-option for the DHCP
   Relay Agent option.

   The format of the RADIUS Attributes sub-option is:

        SubOpt   Len     RADIUS attributes
         code
       +-------+-----+------+------+------+------+--...-+------+
       |  TBD  |  N  |  b1  |  b2  |  b3  |  b4  |      |  bN  |
       +-------+-----+------+------+------+------+--...-+------+

   The RADIUS attributes are encoded according to the encoding rules in
   RFC 2865, in bytes b1...bN.

4. RADIUS Server Behavior

   The RADIUS server MUST return the User-Name and Class attributes to
   the access device, and MAY return other attributes.

   To avoid dependencies between the address allocation and other state
   information between the RADIUS server and the DHCP server, only the
   attributes in the table below SHOULD be included in this sub-option.
   Because RADIUS servers rely on the directive in section 1.1 or RFC
   2865 that "A NAS MUST treat a RADIUS access-accept authorizing an
   unavailable service as an access-reject instead.", a RADIUS server
   SHOULD send only those attributes for which the relay agent can
   ensure that either the relay agent or the DHCP server will provide
   the associated service.  The following table, based on the analysis
   in RFC 3580 [10], lists attributes that MAY be included:

            #   Attribute
          ---   ---------
            1   User-Name (RFC 2865)
            4   NAS-IP-Address (RFC 2865)
            6   Service-Type (RFC 2865)
           25   Class (RFC 2865)
           26   Vendor-Specific (RFC 2865)
           27   Session-Timeout (RFC 2865)
           30   Called-Station-Id (RFC 2865)
           31   Calling-Station-Id (RFC 2865)
           32   NAS-Identifier (RFC 2865)

          100   Framed-IPv6-Pool (RFC 3162)


5. DHCP Relay Agent Behavior

   When the DHCP relay agent receives a DHCP message from the client, it
   MAY append a DHCP Relay Agent Information option containing the
   RADIUS Attributes sub-option, along with any other sub-options it is
   configured to supply.  The RADIUS Attributes sub-option MUST contain
   the attributes received in response to the client's authentication
   with the RADIUS service. The DHCP relay agent MUST NOT add more than
   one RADIUS Attributes sub-option in a message.

   The relay agent SHOULD include the User-Name and Class attributes in
   the RADIUS Attributes sub-option, and MAY include other attributes.

6. DHCP Server Behavior

   When the DHCP server receives a message from a relay agent containing
   a RADIUS Attributes sub-option, it extracts the contents of the of
   the sub-option and uses that information in selecting configuration
   parameters for the client.  Even if the relay agent forwards other
   RADIUS attributes from the RADIUS server, the DHCP server SHOULD
   ignore any attributes it receives for which it cannot ensure that the
   associated service will be provided either by the DHCP server or the
   relay agent.

7. DHCP Client Behavior

   Relay agent options are exchanged only between relay agents and DHCP
   server, so DHCP clients are never aware of their use.

8. Security Considerations

   Message authentication in DHCP for intradomain use where the
   out-of-band exchange of a shared secret is feasible is defined in RFC
   3118 [8].  Potential exposures to attack are discussed in section 7
   of the DHCP protocol specification in RFC 2131.

   The DHCP Relay Agent option depends on a trusted relationship between
   the DHCP relay agent and the server, as described in section 5 of RFC
   3046.  While the introduction of fraudulent relay-agent options can
   be prevented by a perimeter defense that blocks these options unless
   the relay agent is trusted, a deeper defense using the authentication

   option for relay agent options [11] or IPsec [12] SHOULD be deployed
   as well.

9. IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned the value of TBD for the DHCP Relay Agent
   Information option sub-option code for this sub-option.  This
   document does not define any new namespaces or other constants for
   which IANA must maintain a registry.

   this Internet Draft. If a standard relating to this subject matter is
   adopted by IETF and any claims of any issued Cisco patents are
   necessary for practicing this standard, any party will be able to
