2 Abstract

   This document specifies an extension to the [VCARD] format for 
   carrying presence information. This is intended as an alternative to 
   developing an XML-based format.

3 Introduction

   This document specifies an extension to the [VCARD] format for 
   carrying presence information. This is intended as an alternative to 
   developing an XML-based format.

   The IMPP working group has been discussing an XML-based format for 
   presence information. However, as we dig deeper into the problem, 
   it's turning out that we want to carry much of the same data as 
   [VCARD]. Rather than start from scratch, this document proposes that 
   we simply adopt [VCARD] and add the fields we need.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [MUSTS] .

4 Extension definition

   Rather than using the "X-" private extension syntax of Section 3.8 of
   [VCARD], this document proposes a new standard type. It is an open

INTERNET-DRAFT               vCard Presence            November 17, 1999

   question whether this new type require a new version number (see 
   Section 3.6.9 of [VCARD] ).

4.1 Instant Message Address

   (Note that this section has not actually been sent to 
   ietf-mime-directory@imc.org, since it's not yet complete.)

   To: ietf-mime-directory@imc.org
   Subject: Registration of text/directory MIME type IMADDR

   Type name: IMADDR

   Type purpose: To specify an INSTANT INBOX ADDRESS (see Section 4 of 
   [IMPP-MODEL] ) at which the object that the vCard refers to can 
   receive messages.

   Type encoding: 8bit

   Type valuetype: A single text value.

   Type special notes: The exact format of this type is not yet 
   determined at this time; it would be the preferred format for INSTANT
   INBOX ADDRESSes, whatever that turns out to be. The two contenders at
   the moment are URI format and [RFC-2303] extended-email format.

   The type can include the type parameter "STATUS", which reports the 
   STATUS (see Section 4 of [IMPP-MODEL] ) associated with the given 
   INSTANT INBOX ADDRESS. For the required STATUS values OPEN and 
   CLOSED, the strings used are "OPEN" and "CLOSED", respectively.

   It may be useful to define an EXPIRES type parameter, to indicate how
   long the presence information is expected to remain valid.

   Type examples:
         IMADDR:impp://example.com/joeUser
         IMADDR:impp=joeUser@example.com


5 Compatibility Considerations

   The formal grammar in Section 4 of [VCARD] seems to imply that any 
   iana-token (that is, any type registered with) IANA is legal in a 
   vCard, even if it did not occur in the original RFC. Since code 
   cannot tell whether a token is registered or not, this probably means
   that existing implementations ignore types they do not recognize. If 
   so, then it is safe to pass a vCard which includes the IMADDR type to
   an existing implementation; if not, then PRESENCE USER AGENTs must 
   take care not to do so.

6 Internationalization Considerations

   This proposal builds on [VCARD] which builds on [TEXT-DIRECTORY],

INTERNET-DRAFT               vCard Presence            November 17, 1999

   which provides internationalization capabilities: the character set 
   is specified by the "charset" parameter of the text/directory 
   Content-Type (see Section 5.3 of [VCARD] > and the language is 
   specified by the MIME Content-Language header and the "language" type
   parameter (see Section 5.8.3 of [VCARD] ).

7 IANA Considerations

   This proposal does not introduce any new IANA considerations.

8 Security Considerations

   This proposal does not introduce any new security considerations over
   those in [VCARD] and [IMPP-MODEL].
