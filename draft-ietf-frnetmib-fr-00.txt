          2.  Abstract

          This memo defines an extension to the Management Information
          Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
          TCP/IP-based internets.  In particular, it defines objects for
          managing the Frame Relay Service.

          This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet
          community.

          3.  The Network Management Framework

          The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
          components.  They are:

                RFC 1155 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing
                and naming objects for the purpose of management.  RFC 1212
                defines a more concise description mechanism, which is wholly
                consistent with the SMI.

                RFC 1156 which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects for
                the Internet suite of protocols.  RFC 1213, defines MIB-II, an
                evolution of MIB-I based on implementation experience and new
                operational requirements.

                RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network
                access to managed objects.

             The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
             experimentation and evaluation.

          4.  Objects

          Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
          termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
          MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation
          One (ASN.1) [7] defined in the SMI.  In particular, each
          object has a name, a syntax, and an encoding.  The name is an
          object identifier, an administratively assigned name, which
          specifies an object type.  The object type together with an
          object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific
          instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we often
          use a textual string, termed the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also
          refer to the object type.

          The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data
          structure corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1
          language is used for this purpose.  However, the SMI [3]
          purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used.
          These restrictions are explicitly made for simplicity.

          The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type
          is represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly
          tied to the notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is
          how the object type is represented when being transmitted on
          the network.  The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding
          rules of ASN.1 [8], subject to the additional requirements
          imposed by the SNMP.

          4.1.  Format of Definitions

          Section 6 contains contains the specification of all object
          types contained in this MIB module.  The object types are
          defined using the conventions defined in the SMI, as amended
          by the extensions specified in RFC1212 [9].

          5.  Overview

          These objects are used when the particular media being used to
          managed Frame Relay Service.  At present, this applies to
          these values of the ifType variable in the Internet-standard
          MIB:

               frame-relay (32)

          This section provides an overview and background of how to use
          this MIB and other potential MIBs when managing a Frame Relay
          Service.

          The following diagram shows the MIB stack that could be
          followed for managing a Frame Relay Service.  This is only an
          example and not meant to be inclusive.

          SCOPE OF MIB:

          The Frame Relay Service MIB will only manage the Frame Relay

          layer MIB (for example, a physical layer MIB or the ATM MIB)
          for each UNI/NNI access channel.

          This MIB will NOT be implemented on User Equipment.

          Internet Draft     Frame Relay Service MIB        May 12, 1993


          Frame Relay Service SNMP MIB for Customer Network Management
          (CNM) is an SNMPv1 MIB.  It provides read-only information
          that allows end-customers to obtain performance monitoring,
          fault detection, and to obtain performance monitoring, fault
          detection, and configuration information about their Frame
          Relay Service.  By using this and other related MIBs, a
          customer's NMS can monitor their PVCs and UNI/NNI access
          channels.  Internal aspects of the network (e.g., switching
          elements, line cards, and network routing tables) are outside
          the scope of this MIB.  The Customer's NMS will be able to
          access the SNMP agent within the Frame Relay network using
          SNMP over UDP over IP with IP encapsulated in Frame Relay
          according to RFC1294/ANSI T1.617 Annex F.  The customer thus
          has a PVC to the SNMP agent.  Alternate access mechanisms are
          possible.  The initial implementation of the MIB is based on
          SNMPv1.  The service capabilities include retrieving
          information and receiving TRAPs.  It is beyond the scope of
          this MIB to define managed objects to monitor the physical
          layer.  Existing physical layer MIBs (e.g., DS1 MIB) and MIB
          II will be used as possible.  The Frame Relay Service SNMP MIB
          for CNM will not contain any managed objects to monitor the
          physical layer.  However, the Frame Relay Service SNMP MIB for
          CNM will contain a pointer to the appropriate lower layer MIB
          for each UNI/NNI access channel.  To the maximum extent as
          possible, PVCs and SVCs will be treated equally in the MIB.

          The Frame Relay Service MIB will only manage the Frame Relay
          portion of the network and will provide a pointer to the lower
          layer MIB (for example, a physical layer MIB or the ATM MIB)
          for each UNI/NNI access channel.


          5.1.  Apply MIB II to a Frame Relay Service

          Use the System Group to apply to the SNMP agent/proxy-agent,
          since the agent/proxy-agent may be monitoring many Frame Relay
          devices in one network.  System Group applies to only one
          system.  This group is not instantiated.

          sysDescr:  ascii string describing the SNMP agent/proxy-agent.
                     can be only up to 255 characters long.

          sysObjectID:  unique OID for the SNMP agent/proxy-agent.

          sysUpTime:  clock in the SNMP agent/proxy-agent; TimeTicks

          sysName:  Domain name of the SNMP agent/proxy-agent, for example,
                    mail.bellcore.com

          sysLocation:  Location of the SNMP agent/proxy-agent
                        ascii string of up to 255 characters

          sysServices:  services of the managed device; suggest
                        using the value "2" which implies that
                        the Frame Relay service is providing
                        a subnetwork level service

          Use the Interface Group to apply to the FR-UNIs and the FR-
          NNIs of the Frame Relay service.  This group is instantiated
          by ifIndex.

          ifIndex:  unique identifier for the UNI/NNI access channel

          ifDescr:  ascii string describing the UNI/NNI access channel,
                    can be only up to 255 characters long.

          ifType:   identifies the service below the network layer and is used
                    to identify the MIB below MIB II as shown in the figure
                    above.
                    "32" for frame-relay

          ifMtu:  size of largest SDU size for frame-relay for
                  this UNI/NNI access channel, e.g., "1600"

          ifSpeed:  actual user information transfer rate of the UNI/NNI
                    access channel in bits per second
                    e.g., 1536000 bits per second for a DS1-based FR-UNI
                    and 1948000 bits per second for an E1-based FR-UNI.

          ifAdminStatus:  the administrative status of the UNI/NNI access channel

          ifOperStatus:  the operational status of the UNI/NNI access channel

          ifLastChange:  Timestamp of the last time something
                         changed on the UNI/NNI access channel

          ifSpecific:  OID pointing to the top of the Frame Relay
                       Service MIB


          5.2.  Apply the DS1/E1 MIB to Frame Relay Service

          Use the DS1/E1 MIB (RFC1406) to manage DS1/E1 UNI/NNI access
          channels.

          The ifIndex value from the UNI/NNI access channels group will
          be used to identify the Frame Relay network UNI/NNI access channel.

          For a Frame Relay DS1/E1
          or DS3/E3 UNI/NNI access channel (either FR-UNI or
          FR-NNI):

          ifIndex = dsx1LineIndex = dsx1IfIndex
          ifIndex = dsx3LineIndex = dsx1IfIndex

          mandatory groups are:

          dsx1ConfigTable
          dsx1CurrentTable
          dsx1IntervalTable
          dsx1TotalTable

          optional groups are:

          dsx1FarEndCurrentTable
          dsx1FarEndIntervalTable
          dsx1FarEndTotalTable


          If the T1/E1 UNI/NNI access channel supports fractional subrates
          then the dsx1FracTable should be supported
          to identify the channels within the T1/E1 line.
          The indices are as follows:

          In this case ifIndex does not equal dsx1LineIndex
          BUT:

          dsx1LineIndex = dsx1FracIndex
          ifIndex = dsx1FracIfIndex
          dsx1IfIndex is not used (noSuchName)

          Internet Draft     Frame Relay Service MIB        May 12, 1993


          The following provides an example of how the indexing works
          for the DS1 MIB and MIB II:

          For example:

          A Frame Relay Switch has three DS1 interfaces:

            DS1 Line 1 has 3 channels defined,
              Channel 1 uses timeslots 1-2,
              Channel 2 uses timeslots 3-5,
              Channel 3 uses timeslots 6-7,
              Remaining timeslots unused.

            DS1 Line 2 has 2 channels defined,
              Channel 1 uses timeslots 1-3,
              Channel 2 uses timeslots 4-7,
              Remaining timeslots unused.

            DS1 Line 3 has 1 channel defined,
              Channel 1 uses timeslots 1-24,
              All timeslots used.

          You have 3 DS1 interfaces off the frame relay network.  You also
          have 6 access channels that are distributed across those 3 interfaces.
          Those six access channels map to an ifIndex value in MIB II.
          Each channel should have:
          ifIndex = 1; ifType = frame-relay
          ifIndex = 2; ifType = frame-relay
          ifIndex = 3; ifType = frame-relay
          ifIndex = 4; ifType = frame-relay
          ifIndex = 5; ifType = frame-relay
          ifIndex = 6; ifType = frame-relay
          (and the other applicable ifTable information)

          Next, Line 1 and 2 are fractional interfaces, whereas, Line 3
          is not.

          Therefore, let's start with what is called Line 3.

            DS1 Line 3 has 1 channel defined,
              Channel 1 uses timeslots 1-24,
              All timeslots used.

          From RFC1406,

          Internet Draft     Frame Relay Service MIB        May 12, 1993


          (let's ignore RFC1406 Section 3.1, because
          for the case where the router proxies for the CSU and you
          would want to manage both internal (router side) and external
          (network side) DS1 interfaces),

          for Line 3:

            dsx1LineIndex = dsx1IfIndex = ifIndex = 1

          for this interface the fractional table is not supported, and there is
          a one-to-one correspondence between a DS1 Line and an access channel.

          Looking at the example and the dsx1ConfigTable,
          this table is not very "friendly" for fractional DS1 interfaces.
          For fractional DS1 interfaces, there is NOT a 1-to-1 relationship
          between an ifIndex value ( = dsx1IfIndex) and dsx1LineIndex, but
          the table forces there to be one.  Rightly so because,
          the table should
          only be used to manage DS1 interfaces once.

          But what to do when you have multiple ifIndices for that
          one dsx1LineIndex?  I suggest return noSuchName for
          dsx1IfIndex when supporting a fractional T1 interface.
          Remember dsx1IfIndex = ifIndex always.

          Line 1 and Line 2 support fractional interfaces.
          By reading the description of dsx1LineIndex in the dsx1ConfigTable:
          "This object is the identifier of a DS1/E1
          Interface on a managed device.  If there is an
          ifEntry that is directly associated with this
          and only this DS1/E1 interface, it should have
          the same value as ifIndex.  Otherwise, number
          the dsx1LineIndices with an unique identifier
          following the rules of choosing a number that
          is greater than ifNumber and numbering the
          inside interfaces (e.g., equipment side) with
          even numbers and outside interfaces (e.g,
          network side) with odd numbers."
          Therefore, using this rule,
          the DS1 lines can be labeled the following way:

          Line 1 => dsx1LineIndex = 7
          Line 2 => dsx1LineIndex = 9  (because they do not correspond
          with one and only one ifIndex.)

          Internet Draft     Frame Relay Service MIB        May 12, 1993


          Remember that this is only
          an index and is not used for anything else but to index the
          DS1 line and it is NOT equal to ifIndex for this case.

          for these two cases; dsx1LineIndex =7 and 9;
          (Remember for these two cases
          dsx1IfIndex.7 = noSuchName and dsx1IfIndex.9 = noSuchName)

          therefore go to fracTable:

          dsx1FracIndex = dsx1LineIndex always
            Line 1 has 3 channels defined,
              Channel 1 uses timeslots 1-2,
              Channel 2 uses timeslots 3-5,
              Channel 3 uses timeslots 6-7,
              Remaining timeslots unused.

          dsx1LineIndex=7

          dsx1FracIfIndex.7.7=4

          I think the description of dsx1FracIfIndex is wrong when
          it says "If no interface is currently using a channel, the
          value should be zero."

          But, because dsx1FracIfIndex is defined
          as INTEGER (1..'7fffffff'h)
                      ^
          you can NOT have an Index = 0; I would say return noSuchName
          for dsx1FracIfIndex.7.8 through dsx1FracIfIndex.7.24

          Next:

            Line 2 has 2 channels defined,
              Channel 1 uses timeslots 1-3,
              Channel 2 uses timeslots 4-7,
              Remaining timeslots unused.

          5.3.  Frame Relay Service MIB Terminology

          Backward - Backward direction data traffic is traffic flowing
          from the terminating access channel to the originating access
          channel. This is illustrated in Figure 2.

          Access Channel - An access channel generically refers to the
          UNI access channel or NNI access channel across which frame
          relay data transmits. An access channel is the access pathway
          for a single stream of user data.

          Within a given T1 line, an access channel can denote any one
          of the following:

           o    Unchannelized T1 - the entire T1 line is considered an access
                channel. Each access channel is comprised of 24 T1 time slots.

           o    Channelized T1 - an access channel is any one of 24 channels.
                Each access channel is comprised of a single T1 time slot.

           o    Fractional T1 - an access channel is a grouping of N T1 time
                slots (NX56/64 Kbps, where N = 1-23 T1 Time slots per FT1 Access
                Channel) that may be assigned in consecutive or non-consecutive
                order.

          Within a given E1 line, a channel can denote any one of the following:

           o    Unchannelized E1 - the entire E1 line is considered a single
                access channel.  Each access channel is comprised of 31 E1 time
                slots.

           o    Channelized E1 - an access channel is any one of 31 channels.
                Each access channel is comprised of a single E1 time slot.

          Internet Draft     Frame Relay Service MIB        May 12, 1993


           o    Fractional E1 - an access channel is a grouping of N E1 time
                slots (NX64 Kbps, where N = 1-30 E1 time slots per FE1 access
                channel) that may be assigned in consecutive or non-consecutive
                order.

          Within a given unformatted line, the entire unformatted line
          is considered an access channel. Examples include RS-232,
          V.35, V.36 and X.21 (non- switched).

          Forward - Forward direction data traffic is traffic flowing
          from the originating access channel to the terminating access
          channel. This is illustrated in Figure 2.

          Originating - Originating refers to the access channel from
          which the virtual connection is initiated. In a multi-network
          PVC, each PVC segment has an originating access channel and
          terminating access channel for each network that the multi-
          network PVC traverses. See Figure 1.

          Permanent Virtual Connection (PVC) - A virtual connection that
          has its endpoints and bearer capabilities defined at
          subscription time.

          Terminating - Terminating refers to the access channel at
          which the virtual connection stops. In a multi-network PVC,
          each PVC segment has an originating access channel and
          terminating access channel for each network that the multi-
          network PVC traverses. See Figure 1.

          Time slot (E1) - An octet within the 256-bit information field
          in each E1 frame is defined as a time slot. Time slots are
          position sensitive within the 256-bit information field.
          Fractional E1 service is provided in contiguous or non-
          contiguous time slot increments.

          Time slot (T1) - An octet within the 192-bit information field
          in each T1 frame is defined as a time slot. Time slots are
          position sensitive within the 192-bit information field.
          Fractional T1 service is provided in contiguous or non-
          contiguous time slot increments.
