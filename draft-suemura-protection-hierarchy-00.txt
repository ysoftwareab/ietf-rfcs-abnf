Abstract 
    
   In this document, we propose two different mechanisms for protection 
   of hierarchical LSPs.  We assume that an hierarchical LSP traverses a 
   network that is partitioned into multiple smaller, non-overlapping 
   subnetworks.  Protection of the hierarchical LSP can be realized 
   through two mechanisms: 1)Subnetwork Protection and 2)End-to-end 
   Protection.  In the subnetwork protection, a backup LSP is pre-
   established within each subnetwork.  In the end-to-end protection, 
   only one end-to-end backup LSP traversing the subnetworks is pre-
   established.  These LSP protection mechanisms are applicable to both 
   vertical and horizontal network hierarchy.  In this document, we also 
   propose procedures for applying the LSP protection mechanisms to 
   vertical hierarchy in a single routing domain.  A simple coordination 
   mechanism for avoiding contentions between protection mechanisms at 
   different layers is addressed as well.

1. Introduction 
    
   Recovery from a failure is an essential function of a transport 
   network.  There are two techniques for recovery: protection and 
   restoration [1].  Both are implemented in either a path-based 
   mechanism or a span-based mechanism.  This document focuses on path-
   based mechanisms. 
    
   In protection, disjoint working and backup LSPs are pre-established.  
   When the working LSP fails, the protected traffic is switched to the 
   backup LSP. Protection techniques can be implemented by several 
   architectures: 1+1, 1:1, and 1:N.  In case of protection of a circuit 
   switched LSP, the 1:1 and 1:N protection architectures require 
   signaling between two ends of the protected domain after the 
   occurrence of a fault, while the 1+1 protection architecture does not 
   [1]. 
    
   In restoration, on the other hand, a new LSP is established for 
   restoring affected traffic after a failure has occurred.  In most 
   cases, restoration is slower in recovering from a failure than 
   protection since it involves path selection and rerouting for the 
   affected traffic. 
    
   In this document, we propose two protection mechanisms for 
   hierarchical LSPs.  Here, network hierarchy is considered from two 
   perspectives [1]: 
    
   (1) Vertically oriented: between two network technology layers. 
   (2) Horizontally oriented: between two areas or administrative 
       subdivisions within the same network technology layer. 
    
   The document is organized as follows.  The LSP protection mechanisms 
   are described in Section 2.  Although they are applicable to both 
   network hierarchies, in Section 3, we describe their implementation  
   only for a network with the vertical hierarchy and a single routing 
   domain.  Protection implementations at the same network technology 
   layer across multiple domains are discussed in [2]. 
    
    
2. LSP Protection Mechanisms 
    
   We propose two LSP protection mechanisms for hierarchical LSPs:  
   1) Subnetwork protection, and 
   2) End-to-end protection. 
   In this section, we only describe protection of a bi-directional LSP, 
   but note that protection of a uni-directional LSP is also possible 
   using the same mechanisms. 
    
   2.1 Subnetwork Protection 
    
   In the subnetwork protection, backup LSPs are pre-established within 
   all subnetworks that the working LSP traverses.  Each backup LSP is 
   routed from an ingress node (a node at which the working LSP enters a 
   subnetwork) to an egress node (a node at which the working LSP exits 
    
   Suemura et al.         Expires June 2002                  [Page 2] 
                   Protection of Hierarchical LSPs      December 2001 
    
   a subnetwork).  After a failure is detected at the working LSP, the 
   protected traffic is switched from the working LSP to the backup LSP 
   only within the subnetwork where the failure has occurred.  Switching 
   is not performed in the other subnetworks. 
    
   An example of the hierarchical LSP with the subnetwork protection 
   mechanism is shown in Figure 1.  From the signaling perspective, 
   nodes N1 and N10 are initiator and terminator nodes of the working 
   LSP, respectively.  The working LSP is routed along N1-N2-N5-N6-N9-
   N10 route.  In subnetwork 1, a protection segment for the working LSP 
   begins at the ingress node N1, and ends at the egress node N2.  A 
   backup LSP for this segment, namely P1B, is routed along N1-N3-N4-N2 
   route.  Likewise, backup LSPs, P2B and P3B, for protection segments 
   N5-N6 and N9-N10 are routed along N5-N7-N8-N6 and N9-N11-N12-N10 
   routes, respectively.  When a node on the working LSP detects a 
   failure, it sends failure indication alarms to the end-nodes of that 
   protection segment, i.e. the ingress and egress nodes of the 
   corresponding subnetwork.  In case of the 1+1 protection architecture, 
   the end nodes immediately perform a switchover from the working LSP 
   to the backup LSP.  If protection architecture requires signaling 
   (as in the case of 1:1 and 1:N protection architectures of circuit 
   switched LSPs), either (or both) of the end-nodes of the protection 
   segment must initiate signaling for the switchover.  
    
   Note that in the subnetwork protection mechanism, the protection 
   segment is shorter than the working LSP, and the alarm transmission 
   time and the signaling time are relatively short.  In other words, 
   recovery time is short.  However, neither the border links of the 
   subnetworks, such as N2-N5 and N6-N9, nor the ingress and egress 
   nodes are protected against failure.  Some extra protection 
   mechanisms, e.g. SONET APS, are necessary to provide recovery from a 
   fault on these links and nodes.

   2.2 End-to-end Protection 
    
   In the end-to-end protection, a backup LSP is pre-established between  
   initiator and terminator nodes of a working LSP.  After a failure has 
   occurred on the working LSP, the end-to-end traffic is switched from 
   the working LSP to the backup LSP. 
    
   An example of the hierarchical LSP with the end-to-end protection 
   mechanism is shown in Figure 2.  Disjoint working and backup LSPs are 
   routed along N1-N2-N5-N6-N9-N10 and N1-N3-N4-N7-N8-N11-N12-N10 routes, 
   respectively.  In this example, there is only one protection segment 
   between N1 and N10 nodes.  When a node on the working LSP detects a 
   failure, it sends failure indication alarms to the initiator node N1, 
   and the terminator node N10.  If necessary, signaling between N1 and 
   N10 nodes is done along the backup LSP. 
    
   A protection segment in the end-to-end protection case is longer than 
   the one in the subnetwork protection case.  This causes longer 
   recovery time, but on the other side, such LSP setup protects all 
   links and nodes, excluding nodes N1 and N10, on the working LSP.

3. Implementation of LSP Protection Mechanisms in Case of Vertical 
   Hierarchy 
    
   In this section, we propose procedures for applying the LSP 
   protection mechanisms shown in Section 2 to a network with vertical 
   hierarchy and a single routing domain.  A GMPLS network provides a 
   connection from one client to another through an LSP. We call this 
   LSP a "client LSP".  If vertical hierarchy exists in a network, the 
   client LSP may be accommodated by forwarding adjacency LSPs (FA-LSPs) 
   [3].  Our proposal includes configuration of the client LSP that 
   provides a connection with the desired level of survivability.

                   Protection of Hierarchical LSPs      December 2001 
    
    
   In order to avoid contentions between recovery mechanisms at 
   different layers of a vertically hierarchical network, a coordination 
   mechanism is necessary [1].  The simplest coordination mechanism   
   sets up LSPs in such a way that recovery is performed solely at one 
   layer.  To define this coordination mechanism, we propose the 
   following rules for setting the Link Protection Type of an FA. 
    
   3.1 Link Protection Type 
    
   The Link Protection Type represents the protection capability that 
   exists for a link [4].  The following values are defined: 
       
      Extra Traffic 
      Unprotected 
      Shared 
      Dedicated 1:1 
      Dedicated 1+1 
      Enhanced 
    
   We propose the following rules for setting the Link Protection Type 
   of an FA: 
    
   i.   When working and backup LSPs are established, and the working 
        LSP is advertised as an FA, the Link Protection Type of the FA 
        is determined based on the protection mechanism used when the 
        working and backup LSPs are established.  For example, if the 
        working and backup LSPs are established in the 1+1 protection 
        architecture, and the working LSP is advertised as the FA, then 
        the Link Protection Type of the FA is "Dedicated 1+1". 
    
   ii.  When working and backup LSPs are established, and the backup LSP 
        is advertised as an FA, the Link Protection Type of the FA is 
        "Extra Traffic". 
       
   iii. When a single FA-LSP is established, and the FA-LSP is 
        advertised as an FA, the Link Protection Type of the FA is found 
        as the smallest value among the Link Protection Types of the 
        traffic engineering (TE) links that compose the route of the FA-
        LSP.  Here, we assume the smallest value of the Link Protection 
        Type is "Extra Traffic" and the largest one is "Enhanced".  For 
        example, if a single FA-LSP is routed along one physical link 
        and another FA with Link Protection Types  "Dedicated 1+1" and 
        "Dedicated 1:1" respectively, and the FA-LSP is advertised as a 
        new FA, the Link Protection Type of the new FA is "Dedicated 
        1:1". 
    
   3.2 Subnetwork Protection 
    
   An example of the application of the subnetwork protection in case of 
   a network with vertical hierarchy is shown in Figure 3.  The network 
   is partitioned into three subnetworks.  Subnetwork 1 and subnetwork 3 
   are SONET layer subnetworks with SONET crossconnect (SXC) nodes.  On 
   the other hand, subnetwork 2 is a lambda layer subnetwork with lambda 
    
   Suemura et al.         Expires June 2002                  [Page 5] 
                   Protection of Hierarchical LSPs      December 2001 
    
   crossconnect (LXC) nodes.  1+1 span protection mechanism (SONET APS) 
   is implemented on physical links SXC2-LXC1 and LXC2-SXC5, which means 
   that these physical links are of type "Dedicated 1+1".  The other 
   physical links are of type "Unprotected". 
    
   In this network, a SONET STS-1 SPE connection, which requires 
   "Dedicated 1+1" protection, should be established between clients C1 
   and C2.  Signaling for setting up a client LSP, P0, between nodes C1 
   and C2 is initiated by node SXC1 (initiator) and terminated by node 
   SXC6 (terminator). 
    
   Before setting up P0, working and backup LSPs are established within 
   each subnetwork, as required by the 1+1 protection mechanism.  In 
   subnetwork 1, the working LSP, P1W, and the backup LSP, P1B, are 
   routed along SXC1-SXC2 and SXC1-SXC3-SXC4-SXC2 routes, respectively.  
   In subnetwork 2, P2W and P2B are routed along LXC1-LXC2 and LXC1-
   LXC3-LXC4-LXC2 routes, respectively.  Similarly, in subnetwork 3, P3W 
   and P3B are routed along SXC5-SXC6 and SXC5-SXC7-SXC8-SXC6 routes, 
   respectively.  These LSPs are the FA-LSPs and are later used to 
   accommodate P0.  The bandwidth of the FA-LSPs must be at least as big 
   as P0, but note that this is a little different concept from the 
   conventional FA-LSP concept.  In general, an FA-LSP is created for 
   aggregating some LSPs, and its bandwidth must be at least as big as 
   the sum of the LSPs that induced it.  However, P1W/B, P2W/B, and 
   P3W/B are established for protection purposes, and they do not 
   necessarily aggregate multiple LSPs.  Introduction of such FA-LSPs 
   (FA-LSPs for protection) brings some benefits: 1) a protection 
   segment can be placed anywhere on the protected LSP and is clearly 
   indicated, 2) the protection granularity can be arbitrary selected, 
   and 3) these features are realized by supporting only one protection 
   mechanism (path protection between the end-nodes of the FA-LSPs).   
    
   In this example, P1W/B and P3W/B are SONET STS-1 LSPs, and P2W/B are 
   lambda OC-48 LSPs.  P1W, P2W, and P3W form FA1, FA2, and FA3 
   respectively.  The Link Protection Types of FA1, FA2, and FA3 are set 
   to "Dedicated 1+1" according to the rule i defined in Section 3.1. 
    
   It is important to emphasize that nodes LXC1 and LXC2 cannot 
   aggregate/disaggregate P0 (STS-1) into/from P2W (OC-48) because their 
   switching granularities are lambda.  Therefore, it is necessary to 
   establish a SONET STS-48 FA-LSP, P4, and form an FA, FA4, between 
   nodes SXC2 and SXC5.  FA4 is used for aggregation purpose only and 
   does not provide protection capability by itself.  However, the route 
   of P4 is composed of TE links SXC2-LXC1, FA2, and LXC2-SXC5, all of 
   which have the protection type of "Dedicated 1+1", and therefore, the 
   Link Protection Type of FA4 is set to "Dedicated 1+1", according to 
   the rule iii defined in Section 3.1. 
    
   Finally, the client LSP, P0, is established.  P0 is a SONET STS-1 SPE 
   LSP and provides a connection between nodes C1 and C2.  The route of 
   P0 is composed of TE links FA1, FA4, and FA3.  All of these FAs are 
   configured with "Dedicated 1+1" protection, which is carried out at 
   one layer only at any portion of the route.  This avoids contention 
   between recovery mechanisms at different layers.

   Creation of P1W/B, P2W/B, P3W/B, and P4 can be triggered 
   administratively or by a signaling message for setting up P0.  A 
   signaling procedure in the latter case is for further study.

   We illustrate two examples, A and B, for the case of end-to-end 
   protection.  They are shown in Figure 4 and 5.  In the end-to-end 
   protection example A, working and backup client LSPs are created to 
   carry out protection by themselves.  On the other hand, in the end-
   to-end protection example B, working and backup FA-LSPs are created 
   to carry out protection.  The working FA-LSP accommodates a single 
   client LSP. 
    
   The network topology is the same as in Section 3.2, except that all 
   links have the Link Protection Type of "Unprotected".  Again, we 
   consider the case where a SONET STS-1 SPE connection, which requires 
   "Dedicated 1+1" protection, should be established between nodes C1 
   and C2. 
    
   In the end-to-end protection scheme A, SONET STS-48 FA-LSPs, namely 
   P1 and P2, are created first.  P1 is routed along SXC2-LXC1-LXC2-SXC5 
   route and it forms FA1.  P2 is routed along SXC4-LXC3-LXC4-SXC7 route 
   and it forms FA2.  These FA-LSPs are not for protection but for 
   aggregation/disaggregation of an STS-1 client LSP into/from an OC-48 
   lambda TE link.  The routes of P1 and P2 are composed of physical 
   links with "Unprotected" Link Protection Type.  Therefore, the Link 
   Protection Types of FA1 and FA2 are "Unprotected", according to the 
   rule iii defined in Section 3.1. 
    
   Then, SONET STS-1 SPE working and backup client LSPs, P0W and P0B,

                   Protection of Hierarchical LSPs      December 2001 
    
   are established.  P0W is routed along C1-SXC1-SXC2-FA1-SXC5-SXC6-C2 
   route, and P0B is routed along C1-SXC1-SXC3-SXC4-FA2-SXC7-SXC8-SXC6-
   C2 routed.  These routes are composed of TE links with "Unprotected" 
   Link Protection Type.  The client LSPs, P0W and P0B, provide 1+1 path 
   protection between nodes SXC1 and SXC6.  When there is no fault on 
   P0W, the connection between nodes C1 and C2 is provided by P0W.  
   Otherwise, in case of a fault on P0W, the connection is provided by 
   P0B.  Note that recovery contention between layers does not occur 
   because protection is carried out at one layer only. 
    
   Creation of P1 and P2 can be triggered by signaling messages for 
   setting up P0W and P0B [3].

   In the end-to-end protection example B, FA-LSPs P1 and P2 are created 
   first. They form FA1 and FA2 respectively.  Next, SONET STS-1 working 
   and backup FA-LSPs, namely P3W and P3B, are established.  P3W and P3B 
   are FA-LSPs for protection purpose only, not for aggregation.  P3W 
   forms FA3 and is routed along SXC1-SXC2-FA1-SXC5-SXC6 route, and P3B 
   is routed along SXC1-SXC3-SXC4-FA2-SXC7-SXC8-SXC6 route.  These 
   routes are composed of TE links with "Unprotected" Link Protection 
   Type.  Since FA-LSPs P3W and P3B provide 1+1 path protection 
   mechanism, the Link Protection Type of FA3 is "Dedicated 1+1", 
   according to the rule i in Section 3.1. 
    
   Finally, a SONET STS-1 SPE client LSP, P0, is setup.  P0 is routed 
   along C1-FA3-C2 route, and provides a connection between nodes C1 and 
   C2.  This connection is protected between nodes SXC1 and SXC6 by 1+1 
   path protection mechanism, provided by P3W and P3B.  Recovery 
   contention between layers does not occur because protection is 
   carried out at one layer only. 
    
   Creation of FA-LSPs P1 and P2 can be triggered by signaling messages 
    
   Suemura et al.         Expires June 2002                  [Page 8] 
                   Protection of Hierarchical LSPs      December 2001 
    
   for establishing FA-LSPs P3W and P3B.  These signaling messages can 
   be initiated by node SXC1 before it initiates a signaling message for 
   setting up the client LSP P0. 
    
   The end-to-end protection scheme B has the following advantages over 
   scheme A: 
    
   o The protection segment can be placed at any portion of the 
     connection and at any switching granularity. 
   o It only requires support of a path protection mechanism between 
     the end-nodes. 
    
   The disadvantage is: 
    
   o The number of required LSPs is larger than in scheme A.
