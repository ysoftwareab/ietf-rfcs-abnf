1 Introduction




D. Singer et al.                                                [Page 1]





Internet Draft            draft-singer-jp2-01              July 3 2000


   This document describes the registration of the MIME sub-types
   image/jp2, video/mj2, and image/jpm. The image encoding is defined by
   [ISO-JPEG2000-1].

   The still image file format to which this document refers is defined
   in Annex I of [ISO-JPEG2000-1]. Note that a file format is optional
   in [ISO-JPEG2000-1], but mandatory for the MIME sub-type. This
   document is not related to the definition of the MIME sub-type
   image/jpeg which is partly defined by [ISO-JPEG-1] and partly by the
   file format specification defined in [JFIF].

   JPEG 2000 is a new standard, intended to create a image coding system
   intended for many types of still images (bi-level, gray-level, color,
   multi-component) with different characteristics (natural images,
   scientific, medical, remote sensing, imagery, text, rendered
   graphics, etc.) allowing different imaging models (client/server,
   real-time transmission, image library archival, limited buffer and
   bandwidth resources, etc.) within a unified system. This coding
   system is intended to provide low bit-rate operation with rate-
   distortion and subjective image quality performance superior to
   existing standards, without sacrificing performance at other points
   in the rate-distortion spectrum.

   This standard is intended to serve still image compression needs that
   are currently not served by the current JPEG standards [ISO-JPEG-1],
   [ISO-JPEG-2], [ISO-JPEG-3], and [ISO-JPEG-4], and is intended to
   compliment, not replace, the current JPEG standards. JPEG 2000 is a
   modern wavelet-based codec that is expected to be widely used for
   still images.  Its use for motion sequences is expected to be similar
   to JPEG:  in those environments where only a single codec is
   required, and JPEG 2000 is available (e.g. digital still cameras
   recording short motion sequences) or where frame-by-frame coding is
   desired (no inter-frame coding).

   Within WG1 of ISO there is an effort under way to define a standard
   file format for Motion JPEG 2000 sequences.  This file format permits
   the carriage of audio as well.  Though the format is based in the MP4
   format, it represents JPEG 2000 as a 'peer' coding system to MPEG-4
   visual, and the only permitted visual coder in a Motion JPEG 2000
   file is JPEG 2000.

   Therefore, to identify this restricted usage, a new mime type is
   desirable.

   This file type is intended always to contain a video sequence, though
   simple audio is permitted.  Therefore it falls correctly under the
   "video" branch of mime types.

   Also within WG1 of ISO there is an effort underway to define a
   standard file format for Compound Images. This file format optionally
   supports other coding systems, in addition to JPEG 2000, as needed.


2. JPEG 2000 Definition

   JPEG 2000 is defined in detail in [ISO-JPEG2000-1]. The documentation
   can be obtained from any national standards body or from ISO at
   http://www.iso.ch, on publication. The standard was approved in
   January 2001 as an International Standard, and is currently awaiting
   publication by ISO as IS 15444-1 and ITU-T as Recommendation T.800.
   Information as to its latest status, and downloads of the initial
   drafts and some supporting documentation are available through the
   JPEG committee's official Web site at http://www.jpeg.org. In
   accordance with current ISO policy documents from the Draft
   International Standard stage onwards are only available for purchase
   as noted above. Should this position change, the JPEG committee
   affirms its intent to make such documentation as freely available as
   it is able to via its Web site.

   While a brief scope and feature description is provided in this
   section as background information, the reader is directed to the
   original JPEG 2000 specification [ISO-JPEG2000-1] to obtain complete
   feature and technical details.

2.1 JPEG 2000 Scope

   JPEG 2000 is used to compress image data that typically comes from
   digital cameras, scanners, frame grabbers, complex image capture
   devices such as medical or satellite systems, and paint- and photo-
   retouching programs. Unlike previous JPEG standards, it includes
   information necessary to allow its use as a complete coding
   architecture.  [ISO-JPEG2000-1] defines a set of lossless (bit-
   preserving) and lossy compression methods for coding continuous-tone,
   bi-level, gray-scale, or colour digital still images. It therefore:
   - specifies decoding processes for converting compressed image data
      to reconstructed image data
   - specifies a codestream syntax containing information for
      interpreting the compressed image data
   - specifies a file format
   - provides guidance on encoding processes for converting source image
      data to compressed image data
   - provides guidance on how to implement these processes in practice
   [ISO-JPEG2000-1] is one of a series of standards which will cover the
   full range of facilities the new architecture is intended to offer.
   Approval has been given for JPEG to develop the following documents
   in addition to [ISO-JPEG2000-1].

Internet Draft            draft-singer-jp2-01              July 3 2000


   - Part 2 - Coding extensions. This includes a more comprehensive file
      format and other extensions to the definitions in [ISO-JPEG2000-
      1]. The mime sub-type image/jpx is recommended to describe files
      based on this Part, and a separate RFC is planned to describe this
      usage and its associated file extensions of jpf and jpx.
   - Part 3 - Motion JPEG 2000. This provides definitions of how the
      standard may be extended for use in recording time series of JPEG
      2000 images with associated metadata such as audio objects. This
      document  registers the mime sub-type video/mj2 for motion JPEG
      2000, with associated file extensions mj2 and mjp2
   - Part 4 - Conformance. This deals with testing of equipment and
      systems claimed to conform to the JPEG 2000 standards
   - Part 5 - Reference software. This will provide developers with a
      source of publicly available reference software. Its role is
      envisaged as similar in concept to that played by the Independent
      JPEG Group (IJG) in publicizing the current [ISO-JPEG-1] standard
   - Part 6 - Compound Image File Format. This describes a file format
      used to store compound documents using JPEG2000 compression. These
      may contain scanned images, synthetic images or both. This work is
      based on the multi-layer Mixed Raster Content (MRC) imaging model,
      defined in ITU-T T.44 | ISO 16485. The mime sub-type image/jpm is
      recommended to describe files based on this Part.

2.2 JPEG 2000 Features

   Some of the features of JPEG 2000 include:
   - JPEG 2000 is capable of describing bi-level, grayscale, palette-
      color, and full-color image data in several color spaces
   - JPEG 2000 includes a number of compression schemes that allow
      developers to choose the best space or time tradeoff for their
      applications
   - JPEG 2000 is designed to be extensible and to evolve gracefully as
      new needs arise
   - JPEG 2000 allows the inclusion of an unlimited amount of private or
      special-purpose information within the metadata of its file format
     - These are features that JPEG 2000 shares with the definition of
      TIFF [RFC-TIFF]. In addition, JPEG 20000 offers:
   - state of the art lossless and lossy compression, based on wavelet
      technology, within a single codestream
   - low bit-rate compression performance effective down to below 0.25
      bits per pixel for high resolution gray-scale images
   - large image handling (greater than 64k x 64k pixels) without tiling
   - single decompression architecture. The current JPEG standard [ISO-
      JPEG-1] has 44 modes, many of which are application specific and
      not used by the majority of JPEG decoders.
   - features to improve transmission in noisy environments, for example
      mobile radio / telephony
   - capability to handle both natural and computer generated imagery

3 Security Considerations

   JPEG 2000 utilizes a structure which can store image data and
   metadata corresponding to this image data. The fields defined in the
   JPEG 2000 standards are of a descriptive nature and provide
   information that may be useful to facilitate viewing, rendering and
   cataloging of images by a recipient. As such, the fields currently
   defined in the JPEG 2000 standards do not in themselves create
   additional security risks, since the fields are not used to induce
   any particular behavior by the recipient application. It should be
   noted that selected metadata filed may encompass information partly
   intended to protect the image against unauthorized use or
   distribution. In this case alteration or removal of this data may
   constitute an offence under national agreements based on WIPO
   treaties.

   JPEG 2000 has an extensible structure, so that it is theoretically
   possible that metadata fields could be defined in the future which
   could be used to induce particular actions on the part of the
   recipient, thus presenting additional security risks, but this type
   of capability is currently not supported in the referenced JPEG 2000
   specification.


4 MIME Types

4.1 Still Image Registration

   The image/jp2 content-type refers to all of the profiles and
   extensions that build on JPEG 2000 [ISO-JPEG2000-1] encoded image
   data. The file format is also defined in [ISO-JPEG2000-1], Annex I.
   The recommended file suffix is "jp2"

Optional parameters:               none
                                   It is up to the implementation to
                                   determine the application (if
                                   necessary) and render the image to
                                   the user.
Encoding considerations:           Binary or Base-64 generally preferred
Security considerations:           see above
Interoperability considerations:   The ability of implementations to
                                   handle all the defined applications

                                   (or profiles within applications) of
                                   JPEG 2000 may not be ubiquitous. As a
                                   result, implementations may decode
                                   and attempt to display the encoded
                                   JPEG 2000 image data only to
                                   determine that the image cannot be
                                   rendered either partially or in full.
                                   It is intended to register further
                                   mime types to handle the additional
                                   capabilities present in [ISO-
                                   JPEG2000-2], [ISO-JPEG2000-3], [ISO-
                                   JPEG2000-4] and any further parts of
                                   the standard that might be created in
                                   future.

Required parameters:               none
Optional parameters:               none
Encoding considerations:           base64 generally preferred; files are
                                   binary and should be transmitted
                                   without CR/LF conversion, 7-bit
                                   stripping etc.
Security considerations:           see above
Interoperability considerations:   A number of interoperating
                                   implementations exist within the
                                   MPEG-4 community;  and that community
                                   has reference software for reading
                                   and writing the file format.
                                   Reference software for MJP2 is also
                                   available.

4.4 Compound Image Registration

   The image/jpm content-type refers to all of the profiles and
   extensions that build on JPEG 2000 [ISO-JPEG2000-1] encoded image
   data. The file format is also defined in [ISO-JPEG2000-6]. The
   recommended file suffix is "jpm"

   To: ietf-types@iana.org
   Subject: Registration of Standard MIME media type image/jpm

MIME media type name:              image
MIME subtype name:                 jpm
Required parameters:               none
Optional parameters:               none
                                   It is up to the implementation to
                                   determine the application (if
                                   necessary) and render the image to
                                   the user.
Encoding considerations:           Binary or Base-64 generally preferred
Security considerations:           see above
Interoperability considerations:   A number of interoperating
                                   implementations are under development
                                   within the JPEG 2000 community.
