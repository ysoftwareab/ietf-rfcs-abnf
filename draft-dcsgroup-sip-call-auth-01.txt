                SIP Extensions for Media Authorization      March 2000

   The distribution of this memo is unlimited.  It is filed as <draft-
   dcsgroup-sip-call-auth-01.txt>, and expires September 30, 2000. Please
   send comments to the authors.

1. Abstract

   This document describes the need for call authorization and offers a
   mechanism for call authorization that can be used for admission control
   and against denial of service attacks.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [2].

3. Background and Motivation

   The current IP Telephony systems consider a perfect world in which there
   is unlimited amount of bandwidth and network layer QoS comes free.  The
   reality is that bandwidth is neither unlimited nor free. Enhanced quality
   of service, as required for high-grade voice communication, needs special
   authorization for better than 'best-effort' service.  Without such a
   capability, it is possible that a single berserk IP telephony device can
   cause denial of service to a significant number of others.

4. Overview

   Integration of Media Authorization and Call Signaling architecture
   consists of SIP Clients which are considered untrusted, and SIP Proxy
   Agents which authorizes the call that is initiated by the SIP Client.

   The Sip Proxy Agent authorizes the Media data flow to/from the SIP Client
   and returns to the Client a Media-Authorization-Token, which is to be
   used for authorization when bandwidth is requested for the data-stream.

   When the Client is ready to send the media data-stream to the other end-
   point, it first requests bandwidth, using the Authorization-Token it
   received from its SIP-Proxy.

5. Changes to SIP to Support Media Authorization

   This document extends SIP in support of an authorization scheme. In this
   architecture the SIP Proxy supplies the client an Authorization-Token
   which is to be used for bandwidth requests. The extension defined allows
   network resources to be authorized by the SIP-Proxy.

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur Form
   (BNF) as described in RFC-2234 [3].

                SIP Extensions for Media Authorization      March 2000

5.1 SIP Header Extension

   The Media-Auth-Token general header conveys an identifier of the local
   Gate to a SIP Client.  This information is used for authorizing the Media
   Stream.

        Media-Auth       = "Media- Authorization" ":"
                                Media-Authorization-Token

        Media-Authorization-Token       = 1*hex

5.2 SIP Procedures

   This section defines a SIP [4] profile for usage in DCS compatible
   systems from the point of view of Authorizing Calls.

   The initial SIP INVITE message, as well as mid-call resource change
   messages and mid-call changes in call destination, should be authorized.
   These SIP messages are sent through the proxies to receive this
   authorization.

5.2.1. Originating Client (UAC)

   The Media-Auth-Token, contained in the Media-Authorization header, is
   included in the first response message sent by the SIP-Proxy to the UAC.

   The Client SHOULD use the Media-Auth-Token when requesting bandwidth for
   Media data stream during initiation and retaining of the bandwidth.

5.2.2. Destination Server (UAS)

   The Destination Server receives the Media-Auth-Token in the INVITE
   message from SIP-Proxy. The Media-Authorization-Token information
   included MUST be stored.

   The Server SHOULD use the Media-Auth-Token when requesting bandwidth for
   Media data stream during initiation and retaining of the bandwidth.

5.2.3. Originating Proxy Behavior

   The Originating Proxy authenticates the caller, and verifies the caller
   is authorized to receive the requested level of QoS.  In cooperation with
   a policy-decision-point, they generate a Media-Auth-Token that contains
   sufficient information for the originating client to get the authorized
   bandwidth for the media streams.

   The Originating Proxy MUST insert the Media-Authorization header in the
   response message that it sends to MTA-o.


5.2.4. Destination Proxy Behavior

                SIP Extensions for Media Authorization      March 2000

   The Destination Proxy authenticates the called party, and verifies the
   called party is authorized to receive the requested level of QoS.  In
   cooperation with a policy-decision-point, they generate a Media-Auth-
   Token that contains sufficient information for the destination servier to
   get the authorized bandwidth for the media streams.

   The Destination Proxy MUST insert the Media-Authorization header in the
   INVITE message that it sends to MTA-d.

6. Examples

6.1. Requesting Bandwidth via RSVP messaging

   Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) is the end-to-end Layer 3
   reservation protocol that is widely used [5].

6.1.1. Originating Client Side

   Figure 1 presents a high-level overview of a basic MTA-to-MTA call flow
   with Media Authorization from the viewpoint of Originating SIP Client. It
   is assumed that the SIP-Proxy has a previously established authentication
   relationship with the MTA.

   When a user goes off-hook and dials a telephone number, the originating
   SIP Client (MTA-o) collects the dialed digits and sends the initial
   INVITE message to its SIP-Proxy.

   The originating SIP-Proxy (DP-o) authenticates MTA-o and                                                                                                                      f                                                            o                                                             r                                                              wards the
                                                        
   INVITE message to the proper destination proxy.

   Assuming that the call is not forwarded, the other end-point sends a 183
   response to the initial INVITE, forwarded back to DP-o. Included in this
   response is the negotiated bandwidth requirement for the connection.

   When DP-o receives the 183, it has sufficient information regarding the
   end-points, bandwidth and characteristics of the media exchange. It
   initiates a Policy-Setup message to PDP-o.

   The PDP-o stores the authorized Media description in its local store
   generates a Authorization-Token that points to this description and
   returns the Authorization-Token to DP-o.

   The DP-o includes the Authorization-Token in the Media-Auth-Token header
   extension that its including into the 183 message.

   MTA-o upon reception stores the Media-Authorization-Token inside the
   Media-Auth-Token header extension.

   Before sending the Media stream, MTA-o and MTA-t each request bandwidth
   using RSVP-PATH message which includes the Session info that describes
   the Media data-stream and Tspec that describes the bandwidth requested
   along with Authorization information that was stored in Media-
   Authorization-Token.

   ER-o, upon reception of the RSVP-PATHo message checks the authorization
   through PDP-o COPS message exchange. The PDP-o checks the authorization
   using the stored authorized Media description that was linked to
   Authorization-Token that it returned to DP-o. If authorization is
   successful PDP-o  returns install Decision.

   ER-o checks the admissibility for the call and if admission succeeds, it
   forwards the RSVP-PATHo message.

   Once MTA-o receives the RSVP-PATH-t message it sends RSVP-RESVt message
   to reserve the bandwidth.

   ER-o, upon reception of the RSVP-RESVt message checks the authorization
   through PDP-o COPS message exchange. The PDP-o checks the authorization
   using the stored authorized Media description that was linked to
   Authorization-Token that it returned to DP-o. If authorization is
   successful PDP-o  returns install Decision.

   ER-o checks the admissibility for the call and if admission succeeds, it
   forwards the RSVP- RESVt message.

   Upon reception of RSVP-RESVo message the MTA-o sends RSVP-RESVCONFo
   message to indicate that the reservation completed for one direction.

   Upon reception of both RSVP-RESVCONFt and 200OK the MTA-o returns ACK
   message.

6.1.2. Terminating Client Side

   Figure 2 presents a high-level overview of a basic MTA-to-MTA call flow
   with Media Authorization from the viewpoint of Terminating SIP Client
   (MTA-t). It is assumed that the SIP-Proxy has a previously established
   authentication relationship with the MTA.

   The destination SIP-Proxy (DP-t) upon reception of the Invite message.
   Since it has sufficient information regarding the end-points, bandwidth
   and characteristics of the media exchange. It initiates a Policy-Setup
   message to PDP-t.

   The PDP-t stores the authorized Media description in its local store
   generates a Authorization-Token that points to this description and
   returns the Authorization-Token to DP-t.

   Assuming that the call is not forwarded, the MTA-t sends a 183 response
   to the initial INVITE, which is forwarded back to MTA-o. At the same time
   MTA-t sends RSVP-PATHt message for Media data-stream that includes the
   Session info that describes the Media data-stream and Tspec that
   describes the bandwidth requested along with Authorization information
   that was stored in Media-Authorization-Token.

   ER-t, upon reception of the RSVP-PATHt message checks the authorization
   through PDP-t COPS message exchange. The PDP-t checks the authorization
   using the stored authorized Media description that was linked to
   Authorization-Token that it returned to DP-t. If authorization is
   successful PDP-t returns install Decision.

   ER-t checks the admissibility for the call and if admission succeeds, it
   forwards the RSVP-PATHd message.

   Once MTA-t receives the RSVP-PATHo message it sends RSVP-RESVo message to
   reserve the bandwidth.

   ER-t, upon reception of the RSVP-RESVo message checks the authorization
   through PDP-t COPS message exchange. The PDP-t checks the authorization
   using the stored authorized Media description that was linked to
   Authorization-Token that it returned to DP-t. If authorization is
   successful PDP-t returns install Decision.

   ER-t checks the admissibility for the call and if admission succeeds, it
   forwards the RSVP- RESVo message.

   Upon reception of RSVP-RESVd message the MTA-t sends RSVP-RESVCONFt
   message to indicate that the reservation completed for one direction.

   Upon reception of both RSVP-RESVCONFo and 200OK the MTA-t returns ACK
   message.

6.2. Requesting Bandwidth via DOCSIS MAC messaging

   The DOCSIS MAC layer QoS Set-Up the call flows are different in the sense
   that the Authorization token is a simple 32bit number. And DSA-REQ, DSA-
   RSP, and DSA-ACK are layer 2 messages that are specific to and optimized
   for Cable environment which simplifies/reduces delays for the embedded
   client implementation.

6.2.1. Originating Client Side


   Figure 3 presents a high-level overview of a basic MTA-to-MTA call flow
   with Media Authorization from the viewpoint of Originating SIP Client
   (MTA-o). It is assumed that the SIP-Proxy has a previously established
   authentication relationship with the MTA.

   When a user goes off-hook and dials a telephone number, the originating
   SIP Client (MTA-o) collects the dialed digits and sends the initial
   INVITE message to its SIP-Proxy.

   The originating SIP-Proxy (DP-o) authenticates MTA-o and forwards the
   INVITE message to the proper destination proxy.

                SIP Extensions for Media Authorization      March 2000

   Assuming that the call is not forwarded, the other end-point sends a 183
   response to the initial INVITE, forwarded back to DP-o. Included in this
   response is the negotiated bandwidth requirement for the connection.

   When DP-o receives the 183, it has sufficient information regarding the
   end-points, bandwidth and characteristics of the media exchange. It sends
   a Gate-Setup message to ER/CMTS-t containing Media data-stream
   description and bandwidth characteristics. The ER/CMTS-t returns a 32 bit
   index value that inside ER/CMTS-t points to Media definition that DP-o
   send out.

   MTA-t sends DSA-REQ message asking for bandwidth which includes the 32
   bit index value.

   ER/CMTS-t, upon reception of the RSA-REQ message uses the index value to
   find the authorized media description. Checks the requested media link
   against authorized if the both authorization and admission succeeds it
   starts a layer 2 link for Media data-stream on the Cable Access link and
   returns DSA-RSP, which is acknowledged by MTA-o via DSA-ACK message.

   Upon reception of 200OK the MTA-t returns ACK message.

6.2.2. Terminating Client Side

   Figure 4 presents a high-level overview of a basic MTA-to-MTA call flow
   with Media Authorization from the viewpoint of Terminating SIP Client
   (MTA-t). It is assumed that the SIP-Proxy has a previously established
   authentication relationship with the MTA.

   When DP-t receives the Invite, it has sufficient information regarding
   the end-points, bandwidth and characteristics of the media exchange. It
   sends a Gate-Setup message to ER/CMTS-t containing Media data-stream
   description and bandwidth characteristics. The ER/CMTS-t returns a 32 bit
   index value that inside ER/CMTS-t points to Media definition that DP-t
   send out.

   The DP-t includes the 32 bit index value in the Media-Auth-Token header
   extension that its including into the Invite message.

   The MTA-t sends a 183 response to the initial INVITE, which is forwarded
   back to MTA-o. At the same time MTA-t sends DSA-REQ message asking for
   bandwidth which includes the 32 bit index value.

   ER/CMTS-t, upon reception of the RSA-REQ message uses the index value to
   find the authorized media description. Checks the requested media link
   against authorized if the both authorization and admission succeeds it
   starts a layer 2 link for Media data-stream on the Cable Access link and
   returns DSA-RSP, which is acknowledged by MTA-o via DSA-ACK message. Upon
   reception of DSA-RSP the MTA-t returns ACK message.

7. Advantages of the Proposed Approach

   The use of call authorization makes it possible to control the
   utilization of network resources. This in turn makes IP Telephony more
   robust against denial of service attacks and various kinds of service
   frauds.

   Using the authorization capability, the service provider can control the
   number of flows, the amount of bandwidth, and the end-point reached
   making the IP Telephony system dependable in the presence of scarce
   resources.


8. Security Considerations

   Media Authorization Tokens sent from a proxy to a UAC/UAS MUST be
   protected from eavesdropping, through a mechanism such as IPSec.
