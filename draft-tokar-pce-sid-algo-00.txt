       Carrying SID Algorithm information in PCE-based Networks.
                      draft-tokar-pce-sid-algo-00

Abstract

   The Algorithm associated with a prefix Segment-ID (SID) defines the
   path computation Algorithm used by Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs).
   This information is available to controllers such as the Path
   Computation Element (PCE) via topology learning.  This document
   proposes an approach for informing headend routers regarding the
   Algorithm associated with each prefix SID used in PCE-computed paths.

1.  Introduction

   A PCE can compute SR-TE paths using prefix SIDs with different
   Algorithms depending on the use-case, constraints, etc.  While this
   information is available on the PCE, there is no method of conveying
   this information to the headend router.

   Similarly, the headend can also compute SR-TE paths using different
   Algorithms, and this information also needs to be conveyed to the PCE
   for collection or troubleshooting purposes.  In addition, in the case
   of multiple (redundant) PCEs, when the headend receives a path from
   the primary PCE, it needs to be able to report the complete path
   information - including the Algorithm - to the backup PCE so that in
   HA scenarios, the backup PCE can verify the prefix SIDs
   appropriately.

   Refer to [I-D.ietf-ospf-segment-routing-extensions] and
   [I-D.ietf-isis-segment-routing-extensions] for details about the
   prefix SID Algorithm.

   This document introduces two new NAI types for the SR-ERO subobject,
   which is defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing].

2.  Terminology

   The following terminologies are used in this document:

   ERO:  Explicit Route Object

   IGP:  Interior Gateway Protocol

   NAI:  Node or Adjacency Identifier.

   PCE:  Path Computation Element

   PCEP:  Path Computation Element Protocol.

   SID:  Segment Identifier.

   SR:  Segment Routing.

   SR-TE:  Segment Routing Traffic Engineering.

3.  SR ERO NAI Extensions

   The SR-ERO subobject encoding is extended with additional NAI types.

   The following new NAI types (NT) are defined:

   o  NT=TBD1: The NAI is an IPv4 node ID with Algorithm.

   o  NT=TBD1: The NAI is an IPv6 node ID with Algorithm.

   This document defines the following NAIs:

   'IPv4 Node ID with Algorithm'  is specified as an IPv4 address and
      Algorithm identifier.  In this case, the NT value is TBD1 and the
      NAI field length is 8 octets.

   'IPv6 Node ID with Algorithm'  is specified as an IPv6 address and
      Algorithm identifier.  In this case, the NT value is TBD2 and the
      NAI field length is 20 octets.

4.  Operation

   IPv4 prefix SIDs used by SR-TE paths with an associated Algorithm
   SHOULD be encoded with 'IPv4 Node ID with Algorithm' NAI.

   IPv6 prefix SIDs used by SR-TE paths with an associated Algorithm
   SHOULD be encoded with 'IPv6 Node ID with Algorithm' NAI.

5.  Security Considerations

   No additional security measure is required.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  PCEP SR-ERO NAI Types

   IANA is requested to allocate new SR-ERO NAI types for the new NAI
   types specified in this document.

                Value    Description           Reference

                 TBD1    IPv4 Node ID with     This document
                         Algorithm
                 TBD2    IPv6 Node ID with     This document
