                   YANG Data Model for RIB Extensions
                draft-acee-rtgwg-yang-rib-extend-00.txt

Abstract

   The Routing Information Base (RIB) is a list of routes and their
   corresponding administrative data and operational state.

   The document [ROUTING-CFG] defines the basic building blocks for RIB,
   and this model augments it to support multiple next-hops (aka, paths)
   for each route as well as additional attributes.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG, [YANG], data model which extends the
   generic data model for RIB by augmenting the ietf-routing model as
   defined in [ROUTING-CFG].

   RIB is a collection of best routes from all routing protocols.
   Within a protocol routes are selected based on the metrics in use by
   that protocol, and the protocol install its best routes to RIB.  RIB
   selects the best route by comparing the route preference (aka,
   administrative distance) of the associated protocol.

   The augmentations described herein extend the RIB to support multiple
   paths per route, route metrics, and administrative tags.

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-KEYWORDS].

2.  Design of the Model

   The YANG definitions in this document augment the ietf-routing model
   defined in [ROUTING-CFG], which provides a basis for routing system
   data model development.  Together with modules defined in

   [ROUTING-CFG], a generic RIB Yang model is defined to implement and
   monitor RIB.

   The models in [ROUTING-CFG] also define the basic configuration and
   operational state for both IPv4 and IPv6 static routes and this
   document also provides augmentations for static routes to support
   multiple next-hop and more next-hop attributes.

2.1.  RIB next-hop dampening

   A feature "next-hop-dampen" is defined.  Implementations that support
   this feature can enable/disable RIB dampening.

2.2.  Multiple next-hops

   Both Ipv4 and IPv6 static route configuration defined in
   [ROUTING-CFG] have been augmented with a multi-next-hop option.

   A static route/prefix can be configured to have multiple next-hops,
   each with their own tag and route preference.

   In RIB, a route may have multiple next-hops.  They can be either
   equal cost multiple paths (ECMP), or they may have different metrics.

2.3.  Repair path

   The loop-free alternate (LFA) Fast Reroute (FRR) pre-computes repair
   paths by routing protocols, and RIB stores the best repair path.

   A repair path is augmented in RIB operation state for each path.

3.  RIB Extensions Model Tree

   A simplified graphical representation of the augmentations described
   herein is included below.

   The meaning of the symbols in this diagrams is as follows:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Curly braces "{" and "}" contain names of optional features that
      make the corresponding node conditional.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write), "ro" state data (read-only), "-x" RPC operations,
      and "-n" notifications.

Internet-Draft             YANG RIB Extensions              October 2015


   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!" a
      container with presence, and "*" denotes a "list" or "leaf-list".

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

   The YANG model augmentations defined herein do not introduce any
   security issues other than those already discussed in [ROUTING-CFG],
   and [NETCONF].  If confidentiality is desired, the underlying NETCONF
   communication should be utilized as described in [NETCONF-SSH].
