Abstract

This option is used by a DHCP client to optionally identify the
type or category of user or applications it represents. The
information contained in this option is an opaque field
that represents the user class of which the client is a member.
Based on this class, a DHCP server selects the appropriate address
pool to assign an address to the client and the appropriate
configuration parameters.
This option should be configurable by a user.



1. Introduction

It is often desirable to provide different levels of service 
to different users of an IP network.
In order for an IP network to implement this service
differentiation, it needs a way to classify users. A simple
solution to this is to use source IP addresses for classification.
Under this scheme, network administrators first configure network
devices such as routers to recognize traffic from a particular
source IP address (or address range) and handle it specially to
meet the desired level of service. Next, they assign the IP
addresses to the hosts of the intended users so that the user will
receive the appropriate level of service. They can configure the
hosts manually with these addresses. However, they cannot use DHCP
for address assignment, even if they are already running a DHCP
server in their network. A current RFC-compliant DHCP server assigns
IP addresses based on the location of the DHCP Client in the network
topology, not the type of user it supports.
This document describes a simple extension of the DHCP protocol
that enables a DHCP server to assign IP addresses from different
address pools depending on the type of users from which it receives
DHCP requests. With this new extension, network administrators will
be able to use DHCP to hand out the appropriate addresses to clients.
An example intended usage is a corporate network subnet consisting
of different departments of users, such as Accounting, Legal, Staff,
etc. It may be desirable to allocate logical address pools to each
of the departments so that network policies may be implemented easily
on IP address ranges; and this would facilitate providing
differential services, such as network reachibility.
A DHCP server can also use the information contained in the User
Class to allocate other configuration parameters than the IP
address. For example, a DHCP server receiving a request from a
client with the User Class set to "accounting auditors" may return
an option with the address of a particular database server.
Indeed a DHCP server may have a single pool of addresses and
only use the user class to select parameters other than IP
addresses.



2. Requirements Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].



3. DHCP Terminology


o "DHCP client"

  A DHCP client or "client" is an Internet host using DHCP to obtain
  configuration parameters such as a network address.


o "DHCP server"

  A DHCP server of "server"is an Internet host that returns
  configuration parameters to DHCP clients.


o "binding"

  A binding is a collection of configuration parameters, including 
  at least an IP address, associated with or "bound to" a DHCP 
  client.  Bindings are managed by DHCP servers.



4. User Class option

This option is used by a DHCP client to optionally identify the
type or category of user or applications it represents.
A DHCP server uses the User Class option to choose the address
pool it allocates an address from and/or to select any other 
configuration option.

This option is a DHCP option [1, 2].

This option MAY carry multiple User Classes.
Servers may interpret the meanings of multiple class
specifications in an implementation dependent or
configuration dependent manner, and so the use of multiple
classes by a DHCP client should be based on the specific server
implementation and configuration which will be used to process
that User class option.

The format of this option is as follows:

	 Code   Len   Value
	+-----+-----+---------------------  . . .  --+
	| 77  |  N  | User Class Data ('Len' octets) |
	+-----+-----+---------------------  . . .  --+

where Value consists of zero or more instances of User Class Data.
Each instance of User Class Data is formatted as follows:

	 UC_Len_i     User_Class_Data_i
	+--------+------------------------  . . .  --+
	|  L_i   | Opaque-Data ('UC_Len_i' octets)   |
	+--------+------------------------  . . .  --+

Each User Class value (User_Class_Data_i) is indicated as an opaque
field.
The value in UC_Len_i does not include the length field itself
and MUST be non-zero.
Let m be the number of User Classes carried in the option. The
length of the option as specified in Len must be the sum of the
lengths of each of the class names plus m:
Len= UC_Len_1 + UC_Len_2 + ... + UC_Len_m + m. 
If any instances of User Class Data are present, the minimum
value of Len is two (Len = UC_Len_1 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2).

The Code for this option is 77.

A server that is not equipped to interpret any given user class
specified by a client MUST ignore it (although it may be reported).
If a server recognizes one or more user classes specified by the
client, but does not recognize one or more other user classes
specified by the client, the server MAY use the user classes it
recognizes.

DHCP clients implementing this option SHOULD allow users to enter
one or more user class values.



5. IANA Considerations

Option 77, which IANA has already assigned for this purpose,
should be used as the User Class Option for DHCP.



6. Security Considerations

DHCP currently provides no authentication or security 
mechanisms.  Potential exposures to attack are discussed
is section 7 of the protocol specification [1].
This lack of authentication mechanism means that a DHCP server
cannot check if a client or user is authorised to use a
given User Class.
This introduces an obvious vulnerability when using the User
Class option. For example, if the User Class is used to give
out special IP addresses that have better QoS associated with
them (as described in section 1), there is no way to authenticate
a client and it is therefore impossible to check if a client is
authorised to use such an IP address.
