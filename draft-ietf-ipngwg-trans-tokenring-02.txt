1.   Introduction

     This memo specifies the MTU and frame format for transmission
     of IPv6 packets on Token Ring networks. It also specifies the
     method of forming IPv6 link-local addresses on Token Ring
     networks and the content of the Source/Target Link-layer
     Address option used the Router Solicitation, Router
     Advertisement, Neighbor Solicitation and Neighbor
     Advertisement messages when those messages are transmitted on
     a Token Ring network.

2.   Maximum Transmission Unit

     IEEE 802.5 networks have a maximum frame size based on the
     maximum time a node may hold the token. This time depends on
     many factors including the data signaling rate and the number
     of nodes on the ring. Because the maximum frame size varies,
     implementations must rely on manual configuration or router
     advertisements [DISC] to determine actual MTU sizes. Common
     default values include approximately 2000, 4000, and 8000
     octets.

     In the absence of any other information, an implementation
     should use a default MTU of 1500 octets. This size offers
     compatibility with all common 802.5 defaults, as well as with
     Ethernet LANs in an environment using transparent bridging.

     In an environment using source route bridging, the process of
     discovering the MAC-level path to a neighbor can yield the
     MTU for the path to that neighbor. The information is
     contained in the largest frame (LF) subfield of the routing
     information field. This field limits the size of the
     information field of frames to that destination, and that
     information field includes both the LLC [LLC] header and the
     IPv6 datagram. Since, for IPv6, the LLC header is always 8
     octets in length, the IPv6 MTU can be found by subtracting 8
     from the maximum frame size defined by the LF subfield. If an
     implementation uses this information to determine MTU sizes,
     it must maintain separate MTU values for each neighbor.

     A detailed list of the LF values and the resulting maximum
     frame size can be found in [BRIDGE]. To illustrate the
     calculation of IPv6 MTU, the following table lists several
     common values. Note that some of the 802.1D LF values would
     result in an IP MTU less than 576 bytes. This size is less
     than the IPv6 minimum, and communication across paths with
     those MTUs is generally not possible using IPv6.

          LF (base)  LF (extension)  MAC MTU  IP MTU

     When presented with conflicting MTU values from several
     sources, an implementation should choose from those sources
     according to the following priorities:

          1.   Largest Frame values from source route bridging
               (only for specific, unicast destinations)

          2.   Router advertisements

          3.   Manual configuration (including DHCP)

          4.   Default of 1500


3.   Frame Format

     IPv6 packets are transmitted in LLC/SNAP frames.  The data
     field contains the IPv6 header and payload. The following
     figure shows a complete 802.5 frame containing an IPv6
     datagram.

          FS:  Frame Status

     In the presence of source route bridges, a routing
     information field (RIF) may appear immediately after the
     source address. A RIF is present in frames when the most
     significant bit of the source address is set to one. (This is
     the bit whose position corresponds to that of the
     Individual/Group bit in the Destination Address.)

     The RIF is a variable-length field that (when present)
     contains a two-octet Routing Control (RC) header, followed by
     zero or more two-octet Route Designator fields:

          Length:  Total length of RIF field in octets

          D:   Direction of source route. A value of 0 means that
               the left-to-right sequence of Route Designators
               provides the path from the sender to recipient. A
               value of 0 indicates the sequence goes from
               recipient to sender.

          LF:  Largest Frame

          rsvd: Reserved

     On transmission, the Route Designator fields give the
     sequence of (bridge, LAN segment) numbers the packet is to
     traverse. It is the responsibility of the sender to provide
     this sequence for Specifically Routed Frames, i.e., unicast
     IP datagrams.


4.   Stateless Autoconfiguration

     The interface identifier [CONF] for a Token Ring interface is
     the EUI-64 identifier [EUI64] derived from the interface's built-
     in 48-bit IEEE 802 address. The OUI of the Token Ring address
     (the first three octets) becomes the company_id of the EUI-64
     (the first three octets). The fourth and fifth octets of the
     EUI are set to the fixed value FFFE hexadecimal. The last

Internet Draft        IPv6 over Token Ring    September 27, 1997



     three octets of the Token Ring address become the last three
     octets of the EUI-64.

     The Interface Identifier is then formed from the EUI-64 by
     complementing the "Universal/Local" (U/L) bit, which is the next-
     to-lowest order bit of the first octet of the EUI-64.  Complementing
     this bit will generally change a 0 value to a 1, since an
     interface's built-in address is expected to be from a universally
     administered address space and hence have a globally unique value.
     A universally administered IEEE 802 address or an EUI-64 is
     signified by a 0 in the U/L bit position, while a globally unique
     IPv6 Interface Identifier is signified by a 1 in the corresponding
     position.  For further discussion on this point, see [AARCH].

     For example, the interface identifier for a Token Ring interface
     whose built-in address is, in hexadecimal and in canonical
     bit order,
                           34-56-78-9A-BC-DE
     would be
                     36-56-78-FF-FE-9A-BC-DE.

     A different MAC address set manually or by software should
     not be used to derive the interface identifier. If such a MAC
     address must be used, its global uniqueness property should
     be reflected in the value of the U/L bit.

     An IPv6 address prefix used for stateless autoconfiguration
     of a Token Ring interface must have a length of 64 bits.


5.   Link Local Address

     The IPv6 link-local address [AARCH] for a Token Ring
     interface is formed by appending the interface identifer,
     as defined above, to the prefix FE80::/64.

6.   Address Mapping -- Unicast

     The procedure for mapping IPv6 addresses into Token Ring
     link-layer addresses is described in [DISC]. The
     Source/Target Link-layer Address option has the following
     form when the link layer is Token Ring.

     Option fields:

          Length:  1 (in units of 8 octets).

          Token Ring Address: The 48 bit Token Ring IEEE 802
               address, in canonical bit order. This is the
               address the interface currently responds to, and
               may be different from the built-in address used as
               the interface identifier.

     When source routing bridges are used, the source route for
     the path to a destination can be extracted from the RIF field
     of received Neighbor Advertisement messages. Note that the

     RIF field of received packets can be reversed into a source
     route suitable for transmitting return traffic by toggling

     the value of the 'D' bit and insuring that the Bcast field is
     set to indicate a Specifically Routed Frame.


7.   Address Mapping -- Multicast

     All IPv6 packets with multicast destination addresses are
     transmitted to Token Ring functional addresses. The following
     table shows the specific mapping between the IPv6 addresses
     and Token Ring functional addresses (in canonical form). Note
     that protocols other than IPv6 may use these same functional
     addresses, so all Token Ring frames destined to these
     functional addresses are not guaranteed to be IPv6 datagrams.

                         least significant bits = 111


     In a bridged token ring network, all multicast packets SHOULD
     be sent with a RIF header specifying the use of the Spanning
     Tree Explorer.

     Note: it is believed that some (very) old bridge
     implementations do not properly support the Spanning Tree
     Explorer mechanism.  In such environments, multicast traffic
     sent through bridges must use a RIF with the All Routes
     Explorer. Consequently, an implementation MAY wish to allow
     the sending of IP multicast traffic using an All Routes
     Explorer. However, such an ability must be configurable by a
     system administrator and the default setting of the switch
     MUST be to use the Spanning Tree Explorer.

8.   Security Considerations

     Token Ring, like most broadcast LAN technologies, has
     inherent security vulnerabilities. For example, any sender
     can claim the identity of another and forge traffic. It is
     the responsibility of higher layers to take appropriate steps
     in those environments where such vulnerabilities are
     unacceptable.
