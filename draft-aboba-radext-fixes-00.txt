INTERNET-DRAFT            RADIUS Issues & Fixes              8 July 2005


1.  Introduction

   The last few years have seen an increase in the deployment of RADIUS
   clients and servers.  Various implementations and versions of these
   implementations interact with each other, creating a variety of
   implementation problems.

   This document is an attempt to document known issues with RADIUS
   implementations so that the community will know what problems to
   watch out for and how to address the problems.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms:

displayable message
     This is interpreted to be a human readable string of characters,
     and MUST NOT affect operation of the protocol.  The message
     encoding MUST follow the UTF-8 transformation format [RFC2279].

Network Access Server (NAS)
     The device providing access to the network.  Also known as the
     Authenticator (IEEE 802.1X or EAP terminology) or RADIUS client.

service
     The NAS provides a service to the user, such as network access via
     802.11 or PPP.

session
     Each service provided by the NAS to a peer constitutes a session,
     with the beginning of the session defined as the point where
     service is first provided and the end of the session defined as the
     point where service is ended.  A peer may have multiple sessions in
     parallel or series if the NAS supports that, with each session
     generating a separate start and stop accounting record.

silently discard
     This means the implementation discards the packet without further
     processing.  The implementation SHOULD provide the capability of
     logging the error, including the contents of the silently discarded
     packet, and SHOULD record the event in a statistics counter.

1.2.  Requirements Language

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in

INTERNET-DRAFT            RADIUS Issues & Fixes              8 July 2005


   [RFC2119].

2.  Issues

2.1.  Session Definition

2.1.1.  Session State

   Some RADIUS client implementations do not properly use the State
   attribute in order to distinguish a restarted EAP authentication
   process from the continuation of an ongoing process (by the same user
   on the same NAS and port).

   The following rules specify how the State attribute is used with
   RADIUS EAP [RFC3579]:

      o  RADIUS servers SHOULD always include the State
         attribute in an Access-Challenge, Access-Accept,
         or Access-Reject message.

      o  Normally, a NAS copies the received State attribute
         to an Access-Request sent as a response to an
         Access-Challenge [RFC2865], Section 5.24. Note that
         an Access-Request sent as a result of a new or
         restarted authentication run MUST NOT include the
         State attribute, even if the State attribute has
         previously been received in an Access-Challenge
         for the same user and port.

2.1.2.  Request-ID Supplementation

   [RFC3579] Section 2.6.1 states:

      In EAP, each session has its own unique Identifier space.  RADIUS
      server implementations MUST be able to distinguish between EAP
      packets with the same Identifier existing within distinct
      sessions, originating on the same NAS.  For this purpose, sessions
      can be distinguished based on NAS and session identification
      attributes. NAS identification attributes include NAS-Identifier,
      NAS-IPv6-Address and NAS-IPv4-Address.  Session identification
      attributes include User-Name, NAS-Port, NAS-Port-Type, NAS-Port-
      Id, Called-Station-Id, Calling-Station-Id and Originating-Line-
      Info.

   There are issues with the suggested algorithm.  Since proxies may
   translate Access-Request attributes such as NAS-IP-Address, depending
   on any attribute under control of the NAS to distinguish request
   identifiers can result in deployment problems.

INTERNET-DRAFT            RADIUS Issues & Fixes              8 July 2005


   The FreeRADIUS implementation does not track EAP identifiers by NAS-
   IP-Address or other attributes sent by the NAS.  Instead, it uses the
   EAP identifier, source IP address, and the State attribute. Since the
   State attribute is under the control of the RADIUS server, this means
   that the uniqueness of each session is controlled by the server, not
   the NAS.

   The algorithm used in FreeRADIUS is as follows:

      if (EAP start, or EAP identity) {
      allocate unique State Attribute
      insert into "active" queue, with key (EAP identifier, State, source IP)
      } else {
      look up active session in queue, with above key
      }

   This algorithm appears to work well in variety of situations,
   including situations where home servers receive messages via
   intermediate RADIUS proxies.

2.2.  Overload Conditions

2.2.1.  Retransmission Behavior

   [RFC2865] Section 2.4 describes the retransmission requirements for
   RADIUS clients:

      At one extreme, RADIUS does not require a "responsive" detection
      of lost data.  The user is willing to wait several seconds for the
      authentication to complete.  The generally aggressive TCP
      retransmission (based on average round trip time) is not required,
      nor is the acknowledgement overhead of TCP.

      At the other extreme, the user is not willing to wait several
      minutes for authentication.  Therefore the reliable delivery of
      TCP data two minutes later is not useful.  The faster use of an
      alternate server allows the user to gain access before giving up.

   Some existing RADIUS clients implement excessively aggressive
   retransmission behavior, utilizing default retransmission timeouts of
   one second or less without support for congestive backoff.   When
   deployed at large scale, these implementations are susceptible to
   congestive collapse.  For example, as the result of a power failure,
   a network with 3000 NAS devices with a fixed retransmission timer of
   one second continuously generated 3000 RADIUS Access-Requests per
   second.  This is sufficient to overwhelm most RADIUS servers.

   Suggested solutions include:



Nelson, Aboba & DeKok         Informational                     [Page 5]





INTERNET-DRAFT            RADIUS Issues & Fixes              8 July 2005


[b]  Jitter.  To avoid synchronization, RADIUS clients SHOULD
     incorporate jitter within its retransmission algorithm.

[a]  Congestive backoff.  While it is not necessary for RADIUS client
     implementations to implement complex retransmission algorithms,
     implementations SHOULD support congestive backoff within the limits
     suggested by [RFC2865] Section 2.4.  For example, an implementation
     SHOULD double the initial retransmission timer until a maximum
     retransmission time is reached, after which the client will
     failover to another RADIUS server.  For example, if the initial
     retransmission timer is one second, a maximum retransmission timer
     of 16 seconds might be used.

2.2.2.  Server Response to Overload

   Some RADIUS server implementations are not robust in response to
   overload, dropping packets with even probability across multiple
   sessions.  In an overload situation, this results in a high failure
   rate for multi-round authentication protocols such as EAP [RFC3579].
   Typically, users will continually retry in an attempt to gain access,
   increasing the load even further.

   A more sensible approach is for a RADIUS server to preferentially
   accept RADIUS Access-Request packets containing a valid State
   attribute, so that multi-round authentication conversations, once
   begun, will be more likely to succeed.  This will allow some users to
   gain access to the network, reducing the load created by ongoing
   access attempts.

2.3.  Interim Update

   [RFC2866] indicates that Acct-Input-Octets, Acct-Output-Octets, Acct-
   Session-Time, Acct-Input-Packets, Acct-Output-Packets and Acct-
   Terminate-Cause attributes "can only be present in Accounting-Request
   records where the Acct-Status-Type is set to Stop."

   However [RFC2869] Section 2.1 states:

      It is envisioned that an Interim Accounting record (with Acct-
      Status-Type = Interim-Update (3)) would contain all of the
      attributes normally found in an Accounting Stop message with the
      exception of the Acct-Term-Cause attribute.

   Although [RFC2869] does not indicate that it updates [RFC2866], this
   is an oversight, and the above attributes are allowable in an Interim
   Accounting record.





Nelson, Aboba & DeKok         Informational                     [Page 6]





INTERNET-DRAFT            RADIUS Issues & Fixes              8 July 2005


2.4.  Multiple Filter-ID Attributes

   [RFC2865] Section 5.11 states:

      Zero or more Filter-Id attributes MAY be sent in an Access-Accept
      packet.

   However in practice the behavior of a RADIUS client receiving
   multiple Filter-ID attributes is implementation dependent.  For
   example, some implementations treat multiple instances of the Filter-
   ID attribute as alternative filters; the first Filter-ID attribute
   having a name matching a locally defined filter is used, and the
   remaining ones are discarded.  Other implementations may exhibit
   different behavior, such as combining matching filters.

   As a result, the interpretation of multiple Filter-ID attributes is
   undefined within RADIUS.  The sending of multiple Filter-ID
   attributes within an Access-Accept SHOULD be avoided within
   heterogeneous deployments and roaming scenarios, where it is likely
   to produce unpredictable results.

2.5.  Mandatory and Optional Attributes

   RADIUS attributes do not explicitly state whether they are optional
   or mandatory.  Nevertheless there are instances where RADIUS
   attributes need to be treated as mandatory.

   [RFC2865] Section 1.1 states:

      A NAS that does not implement a given service MUST NOT implement
      the RADIUS attributes for that service.  For example, a NAS that
      is unable to offer ARAP service MUST NOT implement the RADIUS
      attributes for ARAP.  A NAS MUST treat a RADIUS access-accept
      authorizing an unavailable service as an access-reject instead.

   With respect to the Service-Type attribute, [RFC2865] Section 5.6
   says:

      This Attribute indicates the type of service the user has
      requested, or the type of service to be provided. It MAY be used
      in both Access-Request and Access-Accept packets. A NAS is not
      required to implement all of these service types, and MUST treat
      unknown or unsupported Service-Types as though an Access-Reject
      had been received instead.

   However, [RFC2865] Section 5 states:

      A RADIUS server MAY ignore Attributes with an unknown Type.



Nelson, Aboba & DeKok         Informational                     [Page 7]





INTERNET-DRAFT            RADIUS Issues & Fixes              8 July 2005


      A RADIUS client MAY ignore Attributes with an unknown Type.

   With respect to Vendor-Specific Attributes (VSAs), [RFC2865] Section
   5.26 states:

      Servers not equipped to interpret the vendor-specific information
      sent by a client MUST ignore it (although it may be reported).
      Clients which do not receive desired vendor-specific information
      SHOULD make an attempt to operate without it, although they may do
      so (and report they are doing so) in a degraded mode.

   How are we to interpret the former two excerpts with respect to the
   latter two?  The excerpts overlap in their recommendations because it
   is possible for an attribute with an unknown Type to represent a
   request for an unavailable service.  It is also possible for a VSA to
   represent a request for an unavailable service.  However, where the
   Type or Vendor-ID is unknown, a RADIUS client cannot know whether the
   attribute defines a service or not.

   Our interpretation is that the text from Sections 1.1 and 5.6 refer
   to the behavior of a RADIUS client with respect to known attributes
   requesting an unavailable service.  A RADIUS client is responsible
   for treating as an Access-Reject any service-defining attribute
   documented in a published RFC prior to implementation.

   For example, a RADIUS client implemented after the publication of
   [RFC2868] which does not implement Tunnel Attributes is required to
   treat received Tunnel Attributes as an Access-Reject.  However, a
   RADIUS client implementation created prior to the publication of
   [RFC2868] may ignore Tunnel attributes, since it has no way of
   knowing that these attributes defined a service.

   Overall however, it is best for RADIUS clients to err on the side of
   caution.  RADIUS clients SHOULD assume that an Attribute of unknown
   Type is a potential service definition, and treat it as an Access-
   Reject.  Unknown VSAs SHOULD be ignored by RADIUS clients.

   The recommended behavior of a RADIUS server is different since the
   [RFC2865] text relating to unavailable services applies only to
   RADIUS clients.  RADIUS authentication server implementations SHOULD
   ignore Attributes of unknown Type.  Since RADIUS accounting server
   implementations typically do not need to understand attributes in
   order to write them to stable storage or pass them to the billing
   engine, accounting server implementations SHOULD NOT ignore unknown
   Attributes.

   To avoid misinterpretation of service requests encoded within VSAs,
   RADIUS servers SHOULD NOT send VSAs containing service requests to



Nelson, Aboba & DeKok         Informational                     [Page 8]





INTERNET-DRAFT            RADIUS Issues & Fixes              8 July 2005


   RADIUS clients that are not known to understand them.  For example, a
   RADIUS server should not send a VSA encoding a filter without
   knowledge that the RADIUS client supports the VSA.

2.6.  Interpretation of Access-Reject

2.6.1.  Improper Use of Access-Reject

   The intent of an Access-Reject is to deny access to the requested
   service.  [RFC2865] Section 2 states:

      If any condition is not met, the RADIUS server sends an "Access-
      Reject" response indicating that this user request is invalid.  If
      desired, the server MAY include a text message in the Access-
      Reject which MAY be displayed by the client to the user.  No other
      Attributes (except Proxy-State) are permitted in an Access-Reject.

   This text makes it clear that RADIUS does not allow the provisioning
   of services within an Access-Reject.  If the desire is to allow
   limited access, then an Access-Accept can be sent with attributes
   provisioning limited access.  Attributes within an Access-Reject are
   restricted to those necessary to route the message (e.g. Proxy-
   State), attributes providing the user with an indication that access
   has been denied (e.g. an EAP-Message attribute containing an EAP-
   Failure) or attributes conveying an error message (e.g. a Reply-
   Message attribute).

   Unfortunately, there are examples where this requirement has been
   misunderstood.  [RFC2869] Section 2.2 states:

      If that authentication fails, the RADIUS server should return an
      Access-Reject packet to the NAS, with optional Password-Retry and
      Reply-Messages attributes.  The presence of Password-Retry
      indicates the ARAP NAS MAY choose to initiate another challenge-
      response cycle,"

   This paragraph is problematic from two perspectives.  Firstly, a
   Password-Retry attribute is being returned in an Access-Reject; this
   attribute does not fit into the categories established in [RFC2865].
   Secondly, an Access-Reject packet is being sent in the context of a
   continuing authentication conversation; [RFC2865] requires use of an
   Access-Challenge for this.  [RFC2869] uses the phrase "challenge-
   response" to describe this use of Access-Reject, indicating that the
   semantics of Access-Challenge are being used.

   [RFC2865] Section 4.4, addresses the semantics of Access-Challenge
   being equivalent to Access-Reject in some cases:




Nelson, Aboba & DeKok         Informational                     [Page 9]





INTERNET-DRAFT            RADIUS Issues & Fixes              8 July 2005


      If the NAS does not support challenge/response, it MUST treat an
      Access-Challenge as though it had received an Access-Reject
      instead.

   While it is difficult to correct existing deployments of [RFC2869],
   we make the following recommendations:

[1]  New RADIUS specifications and implementations MUST NOT use Access-
     Reject where the semantics of Access-Challenge are intended.

[2]  Access-Reject MUST mean denial of access to the requested service.
     In response to an Access-Reject, the NAS MUST NOT send any
     additional Access-Request packets for that user session.

[3]  New deployments of ARAP [RFC2869] SHOULD use Access-Challenge
     instead of Access-Reject packets in the conversations described in
     [RFC2869] Section 2.2.

   We also note that the table of attributes [RFC2869] Section 5.19 has
   an error for the Password-Retry attribute.  It says:

   Request  Accept  Reject  Challenge   #    Attribute
   0        0       0-1     0           75   Password-Retry

   However, the text in [RFC2869] Section 2.3.2 says that Password-Retry
   can be included within an Access-Challenge packet, for EAP
   authentication sessions.  We recommend a correction to the table,
   based on [RFC3579]:

   Request  Accept  Reject  Challenge   #    Attribute
   0        0       0       0-1         75   Password-Retry [Note 2]

   [Note 2] As per RFC 3579, the use of the Password-Retry in EAP
   authentications is deprecated.  The Password-Retry attribute can be
   used only for ARAP authentication.

2.6.2.  Service Request Denial

   RADIUS has been deployed for purposes outside network access
   authentication, authorization and accounting.  For example, RADIUS
   has been deployed as a "back-end" for authenticating VOIP connections
   [digest], HTTP sessions [apache], FTP sessions [proftpd], and machine
   logins for multiple operating systems [bsdi, pam, gina].  In those
   contexts, an Access-Reject sent to the RADIUS client MUST be
   interpreted as a rejection of the request for service, and the client
   MUST NOT offer that service to the user.

   For example, when an authentication failure occurs in the context of



Nelson, Aboba & DeKok         Informational                    [Page 10]





INTERNET-DRAFT            RADIUS Issues & Fixes              8 July 2005


   an FTP session, the normal semantics for rejecting FTP services
   apply.  The rejection does not necessarily cause the FTP server to
   terminate the underlying TCP connection, but the FTP server MUST NOT
   offer any services protected by user authentication.

   Users may request multiple services from the NAS.  Where those
   services are independent, the deployment MUST treat the RADIUS
   sessions as being independent.

   For example, a NAS may offer multi-link services, where a user may
   have multiple simultaneous network connections. In that case, an
   Access-Reject for a later multi-link connection request does not
   necessarily mean that earlier multi-link connections are torn down.
   Similarly, if a NAS offers both dialup and VOIP services, the
   rejection of a VOIP attempt does not mean that the dialup session is
   torn down.

   Where a NAS offers multiple services, confusion may result with
   respect to interpretation of a Disconnect-Request [RFC3576].  In
   order to prevent confusion a RADIUS Server SHOULD identify the
   session that it desires to terminate as specifically as possible.
   For example, an Account-Session-ID attribute SHOULD be included in
   Disconnect-Request and CoA-Request packets, rather than just the
   User-Name attribute.

2.7.  RFC 3576 Issues

2.7.1.  Calculation of Message-Authenticator

   [RFC2869] Section 5.19 indicates that the Message-Authenticator
   attribute may be included in Access-Request, Accept, Reject and
   Challenge packets,  and Section 5.14 describes how the Message-
   Authenticator attribute is calculated for these packets:

      When present in an Access-Request packet, Message-Authenticator is
      an HMAC-MD5 [9] checksum of the entire Access-Request packet,
      including Type, ID, Length and authenticator, using the shared
      secret as the key, as follows.

      Message-Authenticator = HMAC-MD5 (Type, Identifier, Length,
      Request Authenticator, Attributes)

      When the checksum is calculated the signature string should be
      considered to be sixteen octets of zero.

      For Access-Challenge, Access-Accept, and Access-Reject packets,
      the Message-Authenticator is calculated as follows, using the
      Request-Authenticator from the Access-Request this packet is in



Nelson, Aboba & DeKok         Informational                    [Page 11]





INTERNET-DRAFT            RADIUS Issues & Fixes              8 July 2005


      reply to:

      Message-Authenticator = HMAC-MD5 (Type, Identifier, Length,
      Request Authenticator, Attributes)

      When the checksum is calculated the signature string should be
      considered to be sixteen octets of zero.  The shared secret is
      used as the key for the HMAC-MD5 hash.  The is calculated and
      inserted in the packet before the Response Authenticator is
      calculated.

   [RFC3576] Section 3.2 indicates that a Message-Authenticator
   attribute may be included within a Disconnect or CoA-Request, ACK or
   NAK.  However [RFC2869] does not describe how a Message-Authenticator
   attribute is calculated for these RADIUS packets, or for Accounting-
   Request or Response packets.

   The algorithm described in [RFC2869] Section 5.14 cannot be applied
   because in a Disconnect, CoA or Accounting-Request packet the Request
   Authenticator is not a nonce, but rather represents a keyed MD5 hash
   over the packet.  This creates a circular dependency -- the Request
   Authenticator depends on Message-Authenticator and Message-
   Authenticator depends on the Response Authenticator.

   As a result, in Accounting, CoA or Disconnect-Request or Response
   packets the Message-Authenticator attribute is calculated as follows:

      Message-Authenticator = HMAC-MD5 (Type, Identifier, Length,
      Authenticator, Attributes)

      When the HMAC-MD5 hash is calculated the Authenticator field and
      Message-Authenticator attribute should be considered to be sixteen
      octets of zero.  The Message-Authenticator is calculated and
      inserted in the packet before the Authenticator is calculated.

2.7.2.  "Authorization-Only" Service-type

   [RFC3576] introduces the Service-Type value of "Authorization-Only"
   in order to enable improved compatibility between RADIUS and
   Diameter.  This Service-Type value was only intended for use in
   connection with [RFC3576].  A Service-Type of "Authorization-Only"
   MUST NOT be included in a RADIUS Challenge or Reject packet and MAY
   only be included in an Access-Request or Accept packet as part of an
   exchange resulting from the sending of a Disconnect-Request or CoA-
   Request containing a Service-Type value of "Authorization-Only".

   Note that [RFC3576] Section 3.2 Note 6 is in error with respect to
   the utility of a Disconnect-Request with a Service-Type of

   "Authorization-Only":

      This enables a usage model akin to that supported in Diameter,
      thus easing translation between the two protocols.

   In fact, Diameter session termination is analogous to a Disconnect-
   Request without a Service-Type of "Authorization-Only" so that use of
   this Service-Type value provides no translation benefits and in fact
   makes translation between RADIUS and Diameter more difficult.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This specification does not create any new registries, nor does it
   require assignment of any protocol parameters.

4.  Security Considerations

   Since this document describes the use of RADIUS for purposes of
   authentication, authorization, and accounting in WLANs, it is
   vulnerable to all of the threats that are present in other RADIUS
   applications. For a discussion of these threats, see [RFC2607],
   [RFC2865], [RFC3162], [RFC3576], [RFC3579], and [RFC3580].
