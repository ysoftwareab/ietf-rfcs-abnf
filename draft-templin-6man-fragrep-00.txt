                     draft-templin-6man-fragrep-00

Abstract

   Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) provides a fragmentation and
   reassembly service for end systems allowing for the transmission of
   packets that exceed the path MTU.  However, loss of just a single
   fragment requires retransmission of the original packet in its
   entirety, with the potential for devastating effects on performance.
   This document specifies an IPv6 fragment retransmission scheme that
   matches the loss unit to the retransmission unit.

1.  Introduction

   Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) [RFC8200] provides a fragmentation
   and reassembly service similar to that found in IPv4 [RFC0791], with
   the exception that only the source host (i.e., and not routers on the
   path) may perform fragmentation.  When an IPv6 packet is fragmented,
   the loss unit (i.e., a single IPv6 fragment) becomes smaller than the
   retransmission unit (i.e., the entire packet) which under
   intermittent loss conditions could result in sustained retransmission
   storms with little or no forward progress.

   This document proposes IPv6 fragment retransmission service in which
   the source marks each fragment with an "Ordinal" number, and the
   destination may request retransmissions of any ordinal fragments not
   received.  This retransmission request service is intended only for
   short-duration and opportunistic best-effort recovery (i.e., and not
   true end-to-end reliability).  In this way, the service mirrors the
   Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) function of common data links by
   considering an imaginary virtual link that extends from the IPv6
   source to destination.  The goal therefore is for the destination to
   quickly obtain missing individual fragments of partial reassemblies
   before true end-to-end timers would cause retransmission of the
   entire packet.

   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  IPv6 Fragmentation

   IPv6 fragmentation is specified in Section 4.5 of [RFC8200] and is
   based on an IPv6 Fragment extension header formatted as shown below:

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  Next Header  |   Reserved    |      Fragment Offset    |Res|M|
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                         Identification                        |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   In this format:

   o  Next Header is a 1-octet IP protocol version of the next header
      following the Fragment Header.

   o  Reserved is a 1-octet reserved field set to 0 on transmission and
      ignored on reception.

   o  Fragment Offset is a 13-bit field that provides the offset (in
      8-octet units) of the data portion that follows from the beginning
      of the packet.

   o  Res is a 2-bit field set to 0 on transmission and ignored on
      reception.

   o  M is the "more fragments" bit telling whether additional fragments
      follow.

   o  Identification is a 32 bit numerical identification value for the
      entire IPv6 packet.  The value is copied into each fragment of the
      same IPv6 packet.

   The fragmentation and reassembly specification in [RFC8200] can be
   considered as the default method which adheres to the details of that
   RFC.  This document presents an enhanced method that allows for
   retransmissions of individual fragments.

4.  IPv6 Fragment Retransmission

   Fragmentation implementations that obey this specification write an
   "Ordinal Number" beginning with 1 and monotonically incrementing for
   each successive fragment in the one-octet "Reserved" field of the
   IPv6 Fragment Header.  The Reserved field is then renamed as
   "Ordinal" as shown below:

Internet-Draft        IPv6 Fragment Retransmission          October 2021


      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  Next Header  |    Ordinal    |      Fragment Offset    |Res|M|
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                         Identification                        |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   In particular, when a source that obeys this specification fragments
   an IPv6 packet it sets the Ordinal value for the first fragment to
   '1', the Ordinal value for the second fragment to '2', the Ordinal
   value for the third fragment to '3', etc. up to the total number of
   IPv6 fragments.  When a destination that obeys this specification
   receives an IPv6 fragment with the Reserved/Ordinal field set to non-
   zero, it infers that the source participates in the protocol and
   maintains a checklist of all Ordinal numbered fragments received for
   a specific Identification number.

   If the destination notices one or more Ordinal numbers missing after
   most other Ordinals for the same Identification have arrived, it can
   prepare a Fragmentation Report (Fragrep) ICMPv6 message [RFC4443] to
   send back to the source.  The Fragrep message is formatted as
   follows:

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |     Type      |     Code      |          Checksum             |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                        Identification (0)                     |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                      Ordinal Map (0) (0-31)                   |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                      Ordinal Map (0) (32-63)                  |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                        Identification (1)                     |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                      Ordinal Map (1) (0-31)                   |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                      Ordinal Map (1) (32-63)                  |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                                ...                            |
       |                                ...                            |

   In this format, the destination prepares the Fragrep message as a
   list of ordered-triples of 4-octet fields.  The first field in each
   triple includes the Identification value for the IPv6 packet that is
   subject of the report, while the second and third fields include a
   64-bit bitmap of the Ordinal values received for this Identification.
   For example, if the destination receives Ordinals 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9,



Templin                  Expires April 28, 2022                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft        IPv6 Fragment Retransmission          October 2021


   then it sets bitmap bits 0, 1, 3, 4, 6 and 8 to '1' and sets all
   other bits to '0'.  The destination may include as many ordered
   triples as necessary without the entire Fragrep message exceeding the
   minimum IPv6 MTU of 1280 bytes.

   After the destination has assembled the Fragrep message, it transmits
   the message to the IPv6 source.  When the source receives the
   message, it examines each ordered triple to determine the
   (Identification, Ordinal) pairs that require retransmission.  For
   example, if the source receives an Ordinal bitmap for Identification
   0x12345678 with bits 0, 1, 3, 4, 6 and 8 set to '1', it would
   retransmit Ordinal fragments (0x12345678, 3), (0x12345678, 6) and
   (0x12345678, 8).

   This implies that the source should maintain a cache of recently
   transmitted fragments for a time period known as the "link
   persistence interval".  Then, if the source receives a Fragrep that
   requests retransmission of one or more Ordinals, it can retransmit if
   it still holds the Ordinal in its cache.  Otherwise, the Ordinal will
   incur a cache miss and the original source will eventually retransmit
   the original packet in its entirety.

   Note: The maximum-sized IPv6 packet that can undergo fragmentation is
   64KB, and the minimum IPv6 path MTU is 1280B.  Assuming the minimum
   IPv6 path MTU as the nominal size for non-final fragments, the number
   of Ordinals for each IPv6 packet should be significantly less than
   the allotted 64 bitmap bits.

5.  Implementation Status

   TBD.

6.  IANA Considerations

   A new ICMPv6 Message Type code for "Fragmentation Report (Fragrep)"
   is requested.

7.  Security Considerations

   Communications networking security is necessary to preserve
   confidentiality, integrity and availability.
