1. Motivation

   This document describes the minimal set of procedures required to
   build inter-operable implementations of multicast support for
   BGP/MPLS VPNs (MVPNs). It is based on prior multicast in BGP/MPLS VPN
   specifications [MVPN-6] that have been implemented and deployed.
   Procedures presented herein are not new. However the intent of this
   document is to clearly define the base set of procedures required to
   build inter-operable implementations of multicast support for
   BGP/MPLS VPNs.

   This document requires PIM-SM as multicast routing protocol in the SP
   network.

Internet Draft    draft-raggarwa-l3vpn-2547-mvpn-00.txt        June 2004


   This document does not preclude various optional optimizations of
   multicast support for BGP/MPLS VPNs - it assumes that procedures for
   such optimizations will be specified in separate documents.


2. Terminology

   In addition to the terminology used in [2547] and [PIM-SM] this
   document introduces the following terms:

   Multicast Domain (MD): A set of VRFs on different PEs, belonging to a
   given VPN, associated with interfaces that can send multicast traffic
   to each other.

   Provider PIM Instance: PIM instance in the SP network

   VPN PIM Instance: PIM instance in the VPN

   P-Join: PIM Join message in the Provider PIM instance.

   C-Join: PIM Join message in the VPN PIM instance.

   Multicast Tunnel (MT): Tunnel created for each MD, in the provider
   PIM instance. The MT is used to carry multicast customer packets,
   both data and control, among the PE routers in a common MD.


3. Introduction

   [2547] specifies a set of procedures which must be implemented for a
   SP to provide a unicast VPN service. [MVPN-6] describes various
   methods that can be used to extend [2547] to enable a SP to provide
   multicast service in a VPN. However it does not specify the minimal
   and the exact set of procedures required for inter-operability. This
   has lead to non inter-operable implementations.

   This document specifies the minimal set of procedures required for an
   inter-operable solution that enable a SP to provide multicast service
   in a VPN. The procedures specified herein require a SP to use PIM-SM
   as the multicast routing protocol in the SP network. Use of other
   multicast routing protocols (PIM-SSM, PIM-BIDIR, PIM-DM) in the SP
   network for the purpose of providing multicast service in a VPN is
   optional and is not part of the minimal set of required procedures
   discussed here.

   Within a VPN, any of PIM-SM, PIM-DM, PIM-SSM, PIM-BIDIR can be used
   as the multicast routing protocol.

3.1. Efficient vs. Scalable Solution

   In the context of this document we define "efficient multicast
   routing" as follows. When a PE router receives a multicast data
   packet of a particular multicast group from a CE router, the packet
   must reach every other PE router which is on the path to a receiver
   of that group. It should not reach any PEs that aren't on the path to
   a receiver. It should not be unnecessarily replicated.  Efficient
   multicast routing requires a source-tree for the multicast group,
   which would mean that the P routers would have to maintain state for
   each transmitter of each multicast group in each VPN.

   Note that efficient multicast routing, as defined above, requires
   potentially an unbounded amount of state in the SP routers, since the
   SP has no control on the number of multicast groups in the VPNs that
   it supports. Nor does the SP have any control over the number of
   transmitters in each group, nor of the distribution of the receivers.

   However, even if the amount of state was possible, the same multicast
   group address can be used in multiple VPNs to carry different
   traffic. This traffic cannot be mixed or delivered to the wrong VPN.
   This dictates the need for a tunneling mechanism to keep the traffic
   with the same destination IP address seperated for each VPN.

   One option is to setup unicast tunnels from the ingress PE to each of
   the egress PEs. The ingress PE replicates the multicast data packet
   received from a CE and sends it to each of the egress PEs using the
   unicast tunnels.  Hence this solution uses ingress replication but
   requires minimal state in the SP network.

   This documents specifies a solution that aims at achieving a
   compromise between the the amount of multicast state required to be
   maintained in the SP network and the efficiency of multicast routing.
   It uses a PIM-SM shared tree multicast tunnel for each VPN.  That
   allows it to bound the total amount of multicast state in the SP
   network solely by the number of VPNs.  PIM-SM provides a way to
   improve efficiency of multicast routing (albeit at the cost of
   additional multicast state in the SP network) by switching from the
   shared tree to source trees, rooted at each PE. The PIM-SM source
   tree is shared by all the multicast sources within a VPN that are
   behind that PE.

4. Basic Concepts

   This section describes terminology used in the remainder of this
   document.

4.1. Multicast Domains

   A "Multicast Domain (MD)" is a set of VRFs on different PEs,
   belonging to the same VPN, associated with interfaces that can send
   multicast traffic to each other. Each MD is assigned a MD P-Group
   address. It is required that each MD be assigned a unique address
   across all the domains that are part of the MVPN service. Each VRF
   has its own multicast routing table. When a multicast control packet
   is received from a particular CE device, PIM RPF lookup and PIM Join
   propagation is done in the associated VRF. Similarly, when a
   multicast data packet is received from a particular CE device,
   multicast data forwarding is done in the associated VRF. The goal of
   this is to send the multicast control or data packet to all other
   VRFs in that MD.  This is achieved by building one or more multicast
   distribution tree for a given MD in the SP network.

4.2. Provider and VPN PIM Instances

   Each PE router runs an instance of PIM per VRF. In each VRF instance
   of PIM, the PE maintains a PIM adjacency with each of the PIM-capable
   CE routers associated with that VRF. The multicast routing table
   created by each instance is specific to the corresponding VRF.  These
   PIM instances are referred as "VPN-specific PIM instances". These PIM
   instances can support any flavor of PIM, for instance PIM-SM or PIM-
   DM.

   Each PE router also runs a "provider-wide" instance of PIM-SM, in
   which it has a PIM adjacency with each of its IGP neighbors (i.e.,
   with P and directly connected PE routers), but NOT with any CE
   routers.  The provider PIM instance MUST support PIM-SM.

   In order to help refer to provider-wide PIM instance and to VPN-
   specific PIM instance, the prefixes "P-" and "C-" are used
   respectively.  Thus a P-Join would be a PIM Join which is processed
   by the provider-wide PIM-SM instance, and a C-Join would be a PIM
   Join which is processed by a VPN-specific PIM instance.  A P-group
   address would be a group address in the SP's address space.

Internet Draft    draft-raggarwa-l3vpn-2547-mvpn-00.txt        June 2004


4.3. Multicast Tunnels

   Each MD is assigned a unique multicast P-group address across the
   provider network. As part of normal PIM-SM procedures the provider
   wide PIM-SM instance has to know the RP for each P-group.

   Each PE sends the traffic for an MD encapsulated to the P-group for
   that MD. This is called a Multicast Tunnel (MT). The MT is treated
   like an interface and normal PIM Hellos are sent through the tunnel.
   This leads to all PEs discovering each other as PIM neighbors over
   that MT interface in the given MD. The details are described in
   section 5.3.1.

   The MT is used to carry multicast C-packets, both data and control
   packets, among the PE routers in a common MD.  Data forwarding is
   described in section 5.2.

   When a packet is received by a PE from another router in the SP
   network, the receiving PE can determine the MT (and hence the MD)
   from which the packet was received as the destination address of the
   packet is the MD P-group address.  The decapsulated packet is then
   passed to the corresponding Multicast VRF and VPN-specific PIM
   instance for further processing.


5. Procedures

5.1. Multicast VPN PIM-SM Join/Prune/Assert Propagation

   For a VRF in a particular MD, the corresponding MT is treated by that
   VRF's VPN-specific PIM instance as an interface.  The PEs which are
   adjacent on the MT must execute the PIM interface procedures,
   including the generation and processing of Assert packets. The VPN
   PIM instances can send C-Join messages through the MT. These messages
   are received by all PEs in the MD. This allows VPN-specific PIM
   Join/Prune messages to be extended from site to site, without
   appearing in the P routers. Note that a C-Join message carries the
   address of the neighbor for which the C-Join message is meant. This
   message is processed by the corresponding PIM neighbor on the MT
   interface.

5.1.1. C-Join/Prune/Assert RPF Interface

   Although the MT is treated as a PIM-enabled interface, unicast
   routing is NOT run over it, and there are no unicast routing
   adjacencies over it.  It is therefore necessary to specify special
   procedures for determining when the MT is to be regarded as the "RPF
   Interface" for a particular C-address.



draft-raggarwa-l3vpn-2547-mvpn-00.txt                           [Page 6]

Internet Draft    draft-raggarwa-l3vpn-2547-mvpn-00.txt        June 2004


   When a PE needs to determine the RPF interface of a particular C-
   address, it looks up the C-address in the VRF. If the route matching
   it is not a VPN-IP route learned from MP-BGP as described in [2547],
   or if that route's outgoing interface is one of the interfaces
   associated with the VRF, then ordinary PIM procedures for determining
   the RPF interface apply.

   However, if the route matching the C-address is a VPN-IP route whose
   outgoing interface is not one of the interfaces associated with the
   VRF, then PIM will consider the outgoing interface to be the MT
   associated with the VPN-specific PIM instance.

5.1.2. C-Join/Prune/Assert PIM Neighbor Address

   Determination of the C-Join PIM neighbor address i.e. the RPF
   neighbor address needs to be further explained. This depends on the
   procedure used to assign an address to the MT inteface. The address
   of this interface MUST be the BGP next-hop address of the unicast VPN
   routes advertised by the MD VRF. This will typically be a PE loopback
   address in the provider address space.

   To determine the C-Join neighbor address, the PE does a route lookup
   on the C-Source address. This address is a VPN unicast route learnt
   from the PE sitting in front of the multicast source. The route
   lookup results in the BGP next-hop of the C-source VPN unicast route.
   This BGP next-hop is the neighbor address to use while sending the
   PIM-Join.

5.1.3. Switching from Shared to Source Specific MD Trees in the SP
   Network

   By default the generation of VPN instance PIM control messages on a
   MT by a PE results in all the other PEs in that MD to switch from the
   shared MD tree in the SP network to a source specific MD tree rooted
   at the PE that is generating the control messages. This is the case
   even though there may not be any multicast sources transmitting in
   that given VRF on that PE. This results in a different source
   specific tree for a given MD for each PE that belongs to that MD.

   To reduce the number of source specific trees in the SP network an
   implementation SHOULD provide the following knobs to control
   switching from the shared MD tree in the SP network:

     a) A knob on the RP so that it sends the source specific MD P-Group
   Join to the source PE (after receiving Register messages) only after
   the multicast traffic being received for that MD from the source PE
   exceeds a certain threshold.

Internet Draft    draft-raggarwa-l3vpn-2547-mvpn-00.txt        June 2004


     b) A knob on a PE so that it sends the source specific MD P-Group
   Join to the source PE only after the multicast traffic being received
   for that MD from the source PE exceeds a certain threshold.

   Note that this is a local implementation choice and does not impact
   inter-operability.

5.2. Multicast VPN Data Forwarding

   A PE in a particular MD transmits a C-multicast data packet through
   the SP network by transmitting it through the MT corresponding to the
   MD. The MT is installed as the outgoing interface for the C-multicast
   data packets when C-Join messages corresponding to the data packet's
   source and group are received on the MT interface.

   An implementation MUST support GRE encapsulation.

   The following diagram shows the progression of the packet using GRE
   encapsulation as it enters and leaves the service provider network.


      Packets received        Packets in transit      Packets forwarded
      at ingress PE           in the service          by egress PEs
                              provider network

                              +---------------+
                              |  P-IP Header  |
                              +---------------+
                              |      GRE      |
      ++=============++       ++=============++       ++=============++

      ++=============++       ++=============++       ++=============++


   The destination address in the P-IP header is the MD address
   corresponding to the MT. This enables the P routers to forward this
   packet along the multicast distribution tree corresponding to the MD.

   The IPv4 Protocol Number field in the P-IP Header must be set to GRE
   (47).

   If a PE in a particular MD transmits a C-multicast data packet to the
   backbone, by transmitting it through an MD, every other PE in that MD
   will receive it. Any of those PEs which are not on a C-multicast
   distribution tree for the packet's C-multicast destination address
   (as determined by applying ordinary PIM procedures to the

   corresponding multicast VRF) will have to discard the packet.

5.3. Operation

5.3.1. PIM Neighbor Discovery in a MD

   MTs are described in section 4.3.  A MT is a pseudo interface unique
   to a VPN that can be created when PIM-SM initializes.  Unicast
   routing is not run over this interface. This interface is used to
   carry PIM control and multicast data traffic. PIM sends Hello
   messages on the MT interfaces using the PE loopback address in the
   provider address space as the source address. Each PE router needs to
   join the MD P-Groups associated with all the MDs it belongs to.
   Discovery of remote PEs in the same VPN is done by sending PIM Hello
   messages over MT tunnels as follows:

   o When PIM-SM initializes in a MD, the PE originates a PIM Join
   message for the MD P-Group address towards the RP in the SP space.
   This is done for each MD that is configured on the PE.

   o Since an MT interface belongs to a VPN, sending a Hello message on
   this interface does the following:
        o The PIM Hello message has the source address of PE's loopback
   interface in the SP address space and the destination of ALL-PIM-
   ROUTERS group.

        o This PIM Hello gets encapsulated in a GRE header with the
   source address as the PE's loopback interface and the destination as
   the MD P-Group address. After the encapsulation, the original PIM-SM
   Hello travels as the data packet in a PIM-SM Register towards the SP
   RP.

        o RP in the SP network knows about all the receivers (the PEs)
   because of the earlier PIM Join for the MD P-Group address that it
   received from all the PEs when they initialized. So, when the RP
   receives the above PIM-SM register, it decapsulates it and forwards
   it down to all the PEs. So, all the remote PEs (including the one who
   sent the packet) receives this data packet which has the source
   address of the originating PE.

        o This PIM Hello packet originated within the VRF travels as the
   data packet (due to encapsulation) in the SP network towards the RP.

        o The above procedure is repeated on all the PEs. Hence, all the
   PEs receive each other's data packets which contain PIM Hello
   messages and discover one another. PEs can decide to send the source
   Join directly to the remote PEs at this point.

Internet Draft    draft-raggarwa-l3vpn-2547-mvpn-00.txt        June 2004


5.3.2. Handling a PIM-Join/Prune received from a CE

   When a PE receives a PIM Join/Prune for a group in the VPN space in
   its VRF, it processes this message exactly as per PIM procedures.
   Then it forwards this message to the upstream PIM neighbor in the
   path to the VPN-RP or the VPN source. The neighbor address in the PIM
   message is set as described in section 5.1.2. The PIM message is
   encapsulated in a GRE header with the source address as the PE's
   loopback interface and the destination as the MD P-Group address.

   The original PIM control message in the VPN instance PIM now becomes
   a data packet within the SP space and gets sent either as the PIM-SM
   Register to the SP-RP or natively through the SP network. It is sent
   to all PEs that had sent a PIM-SM Join for the MD P-Group address
   earlier. The packet finally reaches all the PEs in the MD. The PE for
   which the "upstream neighbor address" matches forwards the original
   PIM control message towards the RP or source behind the CE.


6. Inter-AS Considerations

   [2547] describes three methods for creating inter-AS VPNs:

   Option A: VRF-to-VRF connections at the AS border routers.

   Option B: EBGP redistribution of labeled VPN-IP routes from AS to
   neighboring AS.

   Option C: Multihop EBGP distribution of labeled VPN-IP routes between
   source and destination ASes, with EBGP redistribution of labeled IP
   routes from AS to neighboring AS.

   The mechanisms described in this draft support multi-AS VPN multicast
   when either Option A or C is used. However, they are not sufficient
   when Option B is used. This is because the BGP Next-hop of the VPN
   routes is re-written in Option B at the ASBRs.  As a result of this
   the PIM neighbor and the BGP next-hop do not match and the procedures
   described in section 5.1.2 cannot be used for determining the RPF
   neighbor. Solution to this issue is outside the scope of this
   document.

   It is possible that Option C is used with a 'BGP free SP network'. In
   this case the P routers in one AS do not know how to route to the PE
   addresses in another AS. As a result of this they will not be able to
   forward the P-Join messages towards the egress PE. Solution to this
   issue is outside the scope of this document.

   For inter-AS VPNs that require multicast service if the involved ASs



draft-raggarwa-l3vpn-2547-mvpn-00.txt                          [Page 10]

Internet Draft    draft-raggarwa-l3vpn-2547-mvpn-00.txt        June 2004


   are all under a single provider, these ASs can share RPs, and MSDP is
   not required.  Even if the ASs are under control of multiple service
   providers, the level of cooperation required to offer even plain
   unicast 2547 VPN service is high enough, which means that one more
   issue (ownership of RP) may not be a significant addition to what is
   already required. And if that is the case, the providers can share
   RPs, and MSDP is not required. If each provider insists on having its
   own local RP, MSDP can be used between the RPs that belong to the
   different providers. However, in many cases, this will not be
   necessary.

   If there are inter-AS VPNs that span multiple SPs and require
   multicast service, then MDs (and MTs) for these VPNs will cross
   provider boundaries. The assignment of the multicast group addresses
   associated with the MDs for such VPNs  must then be coordinated upon
   by the providers
