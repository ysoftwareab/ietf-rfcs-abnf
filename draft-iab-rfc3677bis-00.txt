1.  Introduction

   The Internet Society (ISOC) provides organizational and financial
   support for the IETF.  As stipulated in [ISOC-By-Laws] (and
   originally specified in [RFC3677]) the IETF is called upon to name
   Trustees to its Board (BoT), with staggered 3 year terms.  In
   general, this requires that the IETF name one or more Trustees each
   year.

   This memo outlines the process by which the IETF makes that
   selection.  This process will also be used in the event of mid-term
   vacancies that may arise with IETF nominated Board positions.

1.1.  Overview of Selection Process

   In brief, this document describes the timeframe and procedures for
   the IAB to solicit public input and make a selection for the open
   position each year.

Internet-Draft                   isocbot                   February 2016


1.2.  Rationale

   An alternative approach to making a selection for these positions
   would be to use the IETF's NomCom ([RFC7437] and its revisions).
   However, that NomCom is chartered and defined specifically to the
   task of making selections for IETF organization tasks, and the ISOC
   BoT appointment process does not fit that in 2 ways:

   1.  the timeframe of the appointment does not mesh with the IETF
       appointment cycle

   2.  the nature of the deliberations and the type of information
       solicited would be significantly different for an external
       appointment, such as this appointment to the ISOC BoT

   The first issue (timing) could be resolved fairly easily for this
   specific appointment.  The second issue is more general, and not
   reasonably reconciled with the IETF NomCom task as currently
   specified.

   The process described in [RFC7437] is oriented toward soliciting
   feedback from the IETF community with respect to individuals and
   technical positions with which they have personal experience.  To
   make a good decision on external appointments, in general, the NomCom
   would have to understand the requirements for those positions, and
   attempt to evaluate candidates for a very different set of skills
   than is required of IAB/IESG members.  It might also require
   soliciting feedback from outside the IETF community.  There is no
   question that the individuals that constitute the IETF NomCom each
   year have the competence to carry out such a search; the issue is
   that it is a very different task, would require additional time and
   resources, and therefore is a side effort that could very well
   undermine the effectiveness of the NomCom in carrying out its primary
   task for the IETF.

   By contrast, the IAB is chartered to be responsible for IETF external
   liaisons, is a standing body that works with ISOC (and the ISOC
   Board), and therefore has a working knowledge of the requirements of
   the specific position discussed here.

   At some future point, if there is a more general need to make
   external appointments, the IETF may consider broadening the scope of
   the IETF NomCom role, or create a separate nominating committee for
   such external non-liaison appointments.  This document proposes that
   is not necessary or desirable for the purposes of this one annual
   appointment.

2.  Desirable Qualifications and Selection Criteria for an IETF-
    Nominated ISOC Trustee

   Candidates for an ISOC Trustee should have a demonstrable involvement
   in the IETF with a particular focus on active participation in IETF
   Working Groups.

   The candidate is expected to possess clearly demonstrated technical
   competence in Internet technology, and be able to articulate
   technology issues such that the ISOC Board can be provided with sound
   technical perspectives.  The candidate is also expected to be able to
   understand the respective roles and responsibilities of the IETF and
   ISOC and be able to articulate these roles within both organizational
   communities.

   The candidate will also be expected to exercise all the duties of an
   ISOC Board member, including fiduciary responsibility, setting of
   policies, oversight of the operation of the Society, representing the
   interests of the members and stakeholders of the Society and
   participation in all Board meetings and Board activity programs.

   The candidate is not a representative or a delegate of the IETF and
   is not chartered to represent the IETF or the IETF Standards Process
   within the ISOC Board or the broader ISOC community.  However it is
   expected that the candidate would be able to call on experts in the
   IETF community as required, to ensure that the ISOC Board receives
   the highest quality technical advice available.

3.  IETF ISOC Board of Trustees Selection Process

3.1.  Nominations and Eligibility

   Each year, the IAB will make a public call for nominations on the
   ietf-announce@ietf.org mailing list.  The public call will specify
   the manner by which nominations will be accepted and the means by
   which the list of nominees will be published.

   Self-nominations are permitted.  Along with the name and contact
   information for each candidate, details about the candidate's
   background and qualifications for the position should be attached to
   the nomination.  All IETF participants, including working group
   chairs, IETF NomCom members, IAB and IESG members are eligible for
   nomination.

   IAB and IESG members who accept nomination will recuse themselves
   from selection and confirmation discussions respectively.

Internet-Draft                   isocbot                   February 2016


3.2.  Selection

   The IAB will publish the list of nominated persons, review the
   nomination material, and make a selection.

   The selection criteria will include additional consideration of any
   nominated candidates who are concurrently members of the IAB or the
   IESG such that at the time of selection no more than two of the four
   IETF-appointed ISOC Trustees are IAB and IESG members.

3.3.  Confirmation

   The IESG will act as the confirming body for the selection.  In the
   event that the IESG determines not to confirm the nominated
   candidate, the IESG will provide the IAB with the basis for this
   determination and the IAB will nominate another candidate.

3.4.  Timeframe

   ISOC expects to seat new Board members at its annual general meeting
   in June of each year.  Basic timeframe requirements for the IETF
   process are as follows:

   o  4-6 weeks for solicitation of nominations

   o  4-6 weeks for review of nominees, deliberation and selection

   o  4-6 weeks for confirmation (and re-selection as necessary) and
      delivery to ISOC

   In January of each year, the IAB will announce the specific dates for
   the IETF ISOC Trustee selection process for that year (taking into
   account the particular dates of the first IETF meeting of the year,
   etc), following the guidelines above.

3.4.1.  Timing of Fourth Appointment

   There was a change to the ISOC by-laws in 2013 such that the IAB
   appoints a total of four Board members, with that change taking
   effect in 2015.  Every third year, the IAB will appoint two ISOC
   Board members instead of one.

   For clarity, this means the following number of Board members will be
   appointed in the given years:

   o  2015: 2

   o  2016: 1

Internet-Draft                   isocbot                   February 2016


   o  2017: 1

   o  2018: 2

   o  2019: 1

   o  2020: 1

   o  etc.

3.4.2.  Further Changes to Number and Timing of Appointments

   If ISOC further modifies [ISOC-By-Laws] concerning the number of IAB
   appointments to the ISOC Board or the timing thereof, the IAB will
   make reasonable modifications to the processes embodied in this
   document, without requiring further modification to this document.
   Such changes will be announced via an IAB statement.

3.5.  Mid-term Vacancies

   This document describes the process for the general, annual
   appointment of ISOC Trustees to fill the seats of Trustees whose
   terms are ending.  However, if an IETF-appointed Trustee is unable to
   serve his or her full term, the IAB may, at its discretion,
   immediately select a replacement to serve the remainder of the term
   using the interim process defined in Section 3.5.1.  If the IAB does
   not invoke the interim process, the next annual selection process
   will fill the vacancy (if the vacant term does not end at that point)
   as well as the regular appointment for that selection cycle.

3.5.1.  Interim Appointment Process

   If the IAB elects to fill the mid-term vacancy before the next annual
   selection, a separate timeline will be announced and the rest of the
   process described in this document will be followed.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not describe any technical protocols and has no
   implications for network security.
