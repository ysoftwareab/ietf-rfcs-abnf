Abstract

   This document proposes four optional cryptographic user interface 
   suites ("UI suites") for IPsec similar to the two suites specified
   in RFC 4308.  The four new suites provide compatibility with the 
   United States National Security Agency's Suite B specifications.

INTERNET-DRAFT    Suite B Cryptographic Suites for IPsec    January 2007


1. Introduction

   RFC 4308 proposes two optional cryptographic user interface suites
   ("UI suites") for IPsec.  The two suites, VPN-A and VPN-B, represent 
   commonly used present-day corporate VPN security choices and 
   anticipated future choices, respectively.  This document proposes 
   four new UI suites based on implementations of the United States 
   National Security Agency's Suite B algorithms (see [SuiteB]). 

   As with the VPN suites, the Suite B suites are simply collections of
   values for some options in IPsec.  Use of UI suites does not change 
   the IPsec protocols in any way.

2. Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY"
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3. New UI Suites

   Each of the following UI suites provides choices for ESP (see 
   [RFC4303]) and for IKEv1 and IKEv2 (see [RFC2409] and [RFC4306]).
   The four suites are differentiated by the choice of cryptographic
   algorithm strengths and a choice of whether ESP is to provide both 
   confidentiality and integrity or integrity only.  The suite names 
   are based on the AES mode and AES key length specified for ESP.

   IPsec implementations that use these UI suites SHOULD use the suite
   names listed here.  IPsec implementations SHOULD NOT use names
   different than those listed here for the suites that are described,
   and MUST NOT use the names listed here for suites that do not match
   these values.  These requirements are necessary for interoperability.

3.1 Suite "Suite-B-GCM-128"

   This suite provides ESP integrity protection and confidentiality 
   using 128-bit AES-GCM (see [RFC4106]).  This suite or the following 
   suite should be used when ESP integrity protection and encryption 
   are both needed.  


   ESP:
     Encryption     AES with 128-bit keys and 16 octet ICV in GCM mode 
                      [RFC4106]
     Integrity      NULL

                      [RFC4106]
     Integrity      NULL

   IKEv1:
     Encryption                   AES with 256-bit keys in CBC mode
                                    [RFC3602]
     Pseudo-random function       HMAC-SHA-384 [RFCxxxx]
     Hash                         SHA-384 [FIPS-180-2]

     Group Type                   ECP 

   For IKEv1, Phase 1 SHOULD use Main mode.  IKEv1 implementations MUST
   support pre-shared key authentication [RFC2409] for 
   interoperability.  The authentication method used with IKEv1 MAY be
   either pre-shared key [RFC2409] or ECDSA-384 [RFC4754].

4. Security Considerations

   This document inherits all of the security considerations of the
   IPsec, IKEv1, and IKEv2 documents.  See [CNSSP-15] for guidance on 
   the use of AES in these suites for the protection of U.S. Government 
   information. 

   Some of the security options specified in these suites may be found
   in the future to have properties significantly weaker than those that
   were believed at the time this document was produced.

INTERNET-DRAFT    Suite B Cryptographic Suites for IPsec    January 2007


5. IANA Considerations

   IANA has created and will maintain a registry called, "Cryptographic
   Suites for IKEv1, IKEv2, and IPsec" (see [IANA-Suites]).  The 
   registry consists of a text string and an RFC number that lists the
   associated transforms.  The four new suites in this document should 
   be added to this registry after RFC publication and approval by an 
   expert designated by the IESG.

   The new values for the registry are:

   Identifier              Defined in
   Suite-B-GCM-128         RFC draft-solinas-ui-suites-00.txt
   Suite-B-GCM-256         RFC draft-solinas-ui-suites-00.txt
