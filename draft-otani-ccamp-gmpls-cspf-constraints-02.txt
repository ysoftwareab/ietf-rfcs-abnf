                  This draft provides the guideline to consider generalized multi-
                  protocol label switching (GMPLS) traffic-engineering (TE) attributes 
                  for constraint-based shortest path first (CSPF) path computation at a 
                  source node in a GMPLS network environment. This draft summarizes 
                  most possible cases of GMPLS constraint TE attributes at an ingress 
                  link, transit links and an egress link to establish a GMPLS label 
                  switched path (LSP) appropriately.

               1. Introduction 
                   
                  A GMPLS network is, in general, controlled and managed by various 
                  GMPLS specific TE attributes underlying used physical/logical 
                  technologies of links as well as nodes [Arch]. To establish a GMPLS 
                  LSP appropriately in such a networking environment, these TE 
                  attributes (advertised from others or belonging to themselves) must 
                  be dealt correctly when CSPF path computation under a certain GMPLS 
                  constraint is conducted [GMPLS-routing], and GMPLS LSP must be 
                  created following a feasible route. However, since these constraints 
                  vary and are differently understood among such an integrated 
                  environment (especially between optical transport point of view and 
                  packet transport point of view), this draft proposes and provides a 
                  kind of guideline to facilitate GMPLS CSPF path computation, 
                  summarizing most possible cases of GMPLS constraint attributes at an 
                  ingress link, transit links and an egress link to establish a GMPLS 
                  LSP appropriately.

                  3.1 GMPLS TE attributes consideration for CSPF calculation 
                   
                  For CSPF path computation to establish GMPLS LSPs correctly, various 
                  GMPLS attributes [GMPLS-routing, GMPLS-OSPF] of links as well as 
                  nodes, as indicated below, must be taken into account in a GMPLS 
                  network environment in addition to TE attributes of packet based 
                  network [OSPF-TE]. 
                   
                       (1) Encoding-type: SONET/SDH, Lambda, Ethernet, etc. 
                       (2) Switching capability: TDM, Lambda, Fiber, etc. 
                       (3) Bandwidth: OC-192, OC-48, GbE, 10GbE, etc. 
                   
                  These logical attributes have a very tight relationship with 
                  underlying physical technologies such as SONET/SDH, optical transport 
                  network (OTN) or Ethernet in terms of links, and all-optical switches, 
                  SONET/SDH-basis digital cross connect or electrical-basis optical 
                  switches in terms of nodes.  Therefore, the GMPLS LSPs must satisfy 
                  logical constrains as well as corresponding physical constraints. 
                  These constraints are sometimes differently understood among 
                  different layers, and a logically computed GMPLS LSP may violate the 
                  physical constraints, therefore, a consistent guideline to solve this 
                  issue should be formulated.

                  3.2 Considered network model 
                   
                  Figure 1 depicts a typical GMPLS network, consisting of an ingress 
                  link, a transit link as well as an egress link, to investigate a 
                  consistent guideline for GMPLS CSPF path computation. Each link 
                  outgoing or incoming at each interface has its own switching 
                  capability, encoding-type and bandwidth. 
                  The consideration here is based on a single domain GMPLS network, but 
                  the analysis may be able to be applicable to an inter-domain GMPLS 
                  network.

                  For the simplicity of the analysis in CSPF consideration, the below 
                  basic assumptions are made when the LSP is created. 
                   
                       (1) Switching capabilities (SC) of outgoing links from the 
                           ingress and egress nodes (link1-2 and link4-3 in Figure 1)  
                           must be consistent with each other. 
                       (2) SC of all transit links including incoming links to the 
                           ingress and egress nodes (link2-1 and link3-4) should be 
                           consistent with switching type of a LSP to be created. 
                       (3) Encoding-types of all transit links should be consistent 
                           with encoding type of a LSP to be created. 
                        
                  GMPLS network is a multi-layer network, which is composed of multiple 
                  nodes with different switching capability and encoding type 
                  interfaces. Therefore, a hierarchical structure may be considered in 
                  CSPF path computation. In such a case, the combination between the 
                  switching type and encoding type of a desired LSP, and those of all 
                  transit links described as the table in following section may be 
                  acceptable. One of advertised multiple interface switching capability 
                  descriptors for the same link [GMPLS-Routing] should be also 
                  appropriately chosen as the attribute for the link. 
                   
                  Bandwidth of each TE link is maximum LSP bandwidth in interface 
                  switching capability descriptor at the priority for a desired LSP 
                  [GMPLS-OSPF], and encoding-types of incoming and outgoing links on 
                  the same interface (for example, link1-2 and link2-1) should be 
                  consistent with each other.

                  In case that the network is comprised of numbered links and 
                  unnumbered links [RFC3477], an ingress node, who is able to support 
                  numbered links and unnumbered links may choose both links being part 
                  of the same desired LSP. 
                   
                   
               4. CSPF consideration 
                
                  In this section, we consider GMPLS constraints to be satisfied in 
                  different cases of link attributes. When a LSP indicated in below 
                  tables is created, the CSPF path computation must choose the route so 
                  as to satisfy switching capability, encoding-type and bandwidth at 
                  the ingress link, transiting links and the egress link indicated in 
                  columns next to the created LSP, considering underlying physical 
                  constraints. Here, almost cases of GMPLS CSPF consideration are 
                  summarized in this document, however, some cases will be added in a 
                  future version.

                  In this case, since the interface with TDM SC supports sub-rate 
                  switching, BW X can be equal to or less than bw of ingress, transit 
                  and egress links, and must be larger than the minimum LSP bandwidth

                  in the interface switching capability descriptor. A sub-rate 
                  switching is unsuited for a hierarchical LSP, because the lower-layer 
                  link usually has larger granular bandwidth than that layer except 
                  PSC-x, for example a TDM LSP with the desired bandwidth of OC-12 
                  should not use a lambda switching capable link with the bandwidth of 
                  OC-48 as a transit link. In such a case, a lambda LSP as a forwarding 
                  adjacency (FA) LSP is created on the lower (lambda) layer in advance, 
                  then the FA-LSP [LSP-HIER] may be advertised as a TDM SC link.
