                           GPS Over Wfi.
		draft-brew-intarea-underground-00

Abstract

When users are at known undergroudn locations, such as tube stations
they often do not have a GPS signal, as the radio waves from the
satellites required cannot penetrate the earth, this draft suggests
providing GPS locations over WiFI using remote IP detection for a
server to respond with the correct name of clients location and
the clients GPS location.

Extending this to those without WifI access the standard goes one
stage further, by offering a hidden wifi network with a standard name,
such as .location. The principle being that mobile devices can
look for this network in cases where GPS data cannot be collected. It
is hoped that this will allow those using mapping services to know
where they are when travelling on underground trains etc.

1. Introduction 1.1 Motivation

Those travelling underground networks, such as the London underground
or the German autobahn do know where they are when underground. At
best apps such as citymapper will estimate where people are based
on the time the carridge takes to get to their location.  It would
be convient for them to know where they are. This protocol resolves
this problem, not just to those who have a wireless location but also
to those who do not.

1.2 The code for this servlet, implemeted in Java running on tomcat8
is available at https://www.github.com/rydal/underground.

1.3 Security considerations In order to prevent spoofing of the
location https can be used.
