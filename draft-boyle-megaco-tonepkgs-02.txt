   This document provides proposed definitions for several supplemental 
   packages for Megaco/H.248. These packages address support of 
   functionality for basic and enhanced telephony services.  This 
   document is the updated version of the tones packages presented 
   originally in draft-brown-megaco-supplpkgs-00.txt.

3. Call Progress Tones Generator with Directionality Package 
    
   PackageID: cgd (0x????) 
   Version: 1 
   Extends: tonegen version 1 
 
Boyle, et al    Standards Track - Expires August 2001                1             Supplemental Tones Packages for Megaco/H.248  February 2001  
    
   This package defines the basic call progress tones as signals, with 
   the ability to specify in which direction the tone is played with 
   respect to the context. 
    
   3.1 Properties 
    
       None. 
    
   3.2 Events 
    
       None. 
    
   3.3 Signals 
    
       Dial Tone 
    
          SignalID: dt (0x0030) 
    
          Generate dial tone. The physical characteristic of dial tone 
          is available in the gateway. 
    
          Signal Type: Timeout 
          Duration: Provisioned, Not Auditable 
          Additional Parameters:  
 
             Tone Direction 
    
                ParameterID: td (0x01) 
                Type: Enumeration 
                Possible Values: Outward   out  (0x01), 
                                 Inward    in   (0x02), 
                                 Both      both (0x03) 
    
                The tone direction indicates in which direction the 
                signal shall proceed with respect to the center of the 
                context. "Inward" denotes that the signal shall proceed 
                toward the center of the context from the termination, 
                while "outward" denotes that the signal shall proceed 
                toward the edge of the context.  "Both" indicates that 
                the signal shall proceed in both directions. 
                Unspecified tone direction shall default to _outward_. 
                Note that using playtone to generate these signals will 
                prevent the opportunity to use the directionality 
                parameter. 
    
          Additional Values: None 
    
       The other tones of this package are defined in exactly the same 
       way. A table with all signal names and signal Ids is included. 
       Note that each tone is defined solely as a signal, and therefore 
       does not extend the basic tone generation package.

                The tone direction indicates in which direction the 
                signal shall proceed with respect to the center of the 
                context. "Inward" denotes that the signal shall proceed 
                toward the center of the context from the termination, 
                while "outward" denotes that the signal shall proceed 
                toward the edge of the context.  "Both" indicates that 
                the signal shall proceed in both directions. 
                Unspecified tone direction shall default to _outward_. 
                Note that using playtone to generate this signal will 
                prevent the opportunity to use the directionality 
                parameter. 
    
       Off-Hook Warning Tone 
    
          SignalID: roh (0x????)

          to replace the receiver on the cradle. ROH tone corresponds 
          to "receiver off-hook tone" as defined in Telcordia GR-506-
          CORE. The physical characteristic of roh tone is available in 
          the gateway.

                The tone direction indicates in which direction the 
                signal shall proceed with respect to the center of the 
                context. "Inward" denotes that the signal shall proceed 
                toward the center of the context from the termination, 
                while "outward" denotes that the signal shall proceed 
                toward the edge of the context.  "Both" indicates that 
                the signal shall proceed in both directions.

                while "outward" denotes that the signal shall proceed 
                toward the edge of the context.  "Both" indicates that 
                the signal shall proceed in both directions. 
                Unspecified tone direction shall default to _outward_. 
                Note that using playtone to generate this signal will 
                prevent the opportunity to use the directionality

          SignalID: ldi (0x????) 
    
          Generate long distance indicator tone, indicating that the 
          call is a long-distance connection. The physical 
          characteristic of long distance indicator tone is available 
          in the gateway.

                The tone direction indicates in which direction the 
                signal shall proceed with respect to the center of the 
                context. "Inward" denotes that the signal shall proceed 
                toward the center of the context from the termination, 
                while "outward" denotes that the signal shall proceed 
                toward the edge of the context.  "Both" indicates that 
                the signal shall proceed in both directions. 
                Unspecified tone direction shall default to _outward_. 
                Note that using playtone to generate this signal will 
                prevent the opportunity to use the directionality 
                parameter.
