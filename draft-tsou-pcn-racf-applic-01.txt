Abstract

   This document is written to help coordinate work on pre-congestion
   notification (PCN) between the IETF PCN Working Group and the ITU-T.
   It maps the use of PCN into the ITU-T transport control architecture.
   It examines three scenarios, showing in each, where new requirements
   are placed on the ITU-T architecture.  In each case, the ITU-T
   functional entity known as the Transport Resource Control Functional
   Entity (TRC-FE) is seen as the logical destination for PCN congestion
   reports and PCN flow termination reports, which it uses to keep track
   of network status.  As logical entities, instances of the TRC-FE can
   be present in the ingress nodes, in one or more centralized devices,
   or in both.  These alternatives define the scenarios examined.

2.  Introduction

2.1.  Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN)

   The PCN Working Group is working on a new approach for maintenance of
   quality of service (QoS) within Diffserv-controlled domains.  This
   approach is called "pre-congestion notification" (PCN).  The
   principles and associated architecture are documented in
   [I-D.PCNarch].

   PCN distinguishes and assigns roles to ingress nodes, interior nodes,
   and egress nodes relative to a given PCN domain.  Ingress nodes mark
   admitted packets to indicate that they should be PCN-metered.
   Interior nodes check the next-hop interface traffic status for each
   PCN-marked packet before routing it.  Marking behaviour is described
   in detail in [I-D.PCNmark] and depends in fact on the encoding scheme
   being used.  The current view of this encoding scheme is provided in
   [I-D.PCNencod], but other schemes are possible.  In particular, note
   [I-D.PCN3in1].  If three encoding states are available, it is
   possible to have the following marking behaviour:

   o  If the traffic status exceeds a lower "pre-congestion" threshold
      (but not the upper threshold described next), the packet is marked
      to indicate that it has encountered pre-congestion.

   o  If the traffic status exceeds an upper "termination" threshold,
      the packet is marked to indicate that it has encountered a flow
      termination condition.

   The egress nodes relate the packets they receive to the aggregate
   flows they receive from individual ingress nodes.  Statistics on
   packet marking are reported to a decision point (possibly within the
   egress node itself), which makes two decisions:

   o  whether one or more flows should be terminated immediately to
      preserve QoS for the remainder;

   o  whether new flows can be admitted without degrading the QoS for
      existing flows to an unacceptable level.

   The architecture on which the IETF work has focussed assumes that
   egress nodes communicate directly to ingress nodes to effect the
   termination and admission decisions.

2.2.  Admission Control System

   A number of standards bodies (such as the ITU-T and ETSI TISPAN) have
   defined admission control systems (ITU-T RACF [Y.2111], TISPAN RACS



Tsou, et al.               Expires May 3, 2009                  [Page 4]

   [ES283003]) to allow per-flow imposition of policy based on
   subscriptions across a variety of transport technologies.

   This section provides some general guidance how the admission control
   system is used in the PCN environment.

2.2.1.  Basic Flows of the Admission Control System

   The admission control system generally performs both admission
   control functions and flow termination functions based on the network
   congestion status information collected from the PCN-egress-node.

   The PCN-egress-node measures the traffic from a particular PCN-
   ingress-node, and calculates the congestion value at the ingress-
   egress-aggregate level.  The PCN-egress-node may compare the current
   congestion value with the previous congestion value, if the
   difference of the two congestion value exceeds a preset range, the
   PCN-egress-node sends the PCN-feedback-information (e.g. the current
   congestion value for a particular pair of PCN-boundary-nodes) to the
   admission control system.  After receiving the PCN-feedback-
   information, the admission control system saves the information for
   admission control and flow termination.  Based on this information,
   the admission control system can determine whether to admit a service
   flow request or not after receiving the flow request, and can also
   determine whether some of the admitted flows need to be terminated.
   The admission control system also needs to signal to the PCN-ingress-
   node the decision about admission or termination.

2.2.2.  Addressing

   Generally, there is a mapping between the PCN-ingress-node and the
   addresses which are outside the PCN domain and accessible by the PCN-
   ingress-node, i.e. the source addresses of the incoming flows to the
   PCN domain.  The PCN-ingress-node can abstract this mapping from for
   example the routing table or the configuration data.  The PCN-
   ingress-node can send the mapping to the admission control system and
   the admission control system can determine the PCN-ingress-node for
   each flow based on the mapping and the address information of the
   flow.  The admission control system may also forward the mapping to
   the PCN-egress-node, so that the PCN-egress-node can determine the
   PCN-ingress-node of a flow based on the mapping and the address
   information of the flow.

2.3.  Combining the PCN and ITU-T RACF Architectures

   The ITU-T RACF architecture is a generalization of the architecture
   originally developed by 3GPP for cellular radio networks connected to
   an IP core.  The architecture features a top-level control function



Tsou, et al.               Expires May 3, 2009                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft          PCN Applicability to RACF           November 2008


   which transmits requests (push mode) or provides policy responses
   (pull mode) to edge nodes where enforcement takes place.  This top-
   level control function provides an abstract view of network
   infrastructure to the session control layer (SIP servers and the
   like).  A second-level control function is aware of the specific
   transport technology in use in the network, tracks network topology
   and resource availability, and indicates to the top-level function
   whether resources are available to serve a specific flow request.

   In the ITU-T architecture in particular [Y.2111], the top-level
   function is called the Policy Decision Functional Entity (PD-FE-FE),
   and the second-level function is called the Transport Resource
   Control Functional Entity (TRC-FE).  The complete transport control
   subsystem is called the Resource and Admission Control Function
   (RACF).  The function within the edge node at which decisions are
   enforced is called the Policy Enforcement Functional Entity (PE-FE).
   Interested parties will find a complete description of the first
   release of this architecture in [ITU-T Y.2111] , but a partial
   diagram labelling the reference points of interest in this document
   is shown in Figure 1.

   The typical message flow associated with a flow admission request in
   the ITU-T architecture is as follows:

   1.  In the general case, the TRC-FE gathers topology and status
       information from the transport processing layer across the Rc
       reference point.  The use of PCN offers the possibility that the
       TRC-FE no longer has to deal with detailed topology.

   2.  The PD-FE receives a request to admit a flow.  In push mode this
       comes from a P-CSCF, for example, across the Rs reference point;
       in pull mode it comes from the PE-FE across the Rw reference
       point.

   3.  The PD-FE checks subscription data (provided by another
       subsystem) to see if the subscriber is permitted to add the
       requested flow.  If not, it rejects the request immediately.

   4.  The PD-FE contacts an instance of the TRC-FE by way of the Rt
       reference point to determine if the network resources are
       available to allocate to the requested flow.  The selected
       instance may locate other TRC-FE instances along the flow path
       via the Rp reference point to make this determination.

   5.  If the response from the TRC-FE is negative, the PD-FE rejects
       the request.  Otherwise it downloads the required policy to the
       PE-FE across the Rw reference point.  In push mode it also
       responds positively to the original request across the Rs
       reference point.

   The PD-FE and TRC-FE actually track sessions, which typically consist
   of multiple flows in both directions.  The TRC-FE can tell the PD-FE
   to terminate a flow or to abort a complete session due to, for
   instance, loss of the supporting resources.  The PD-FE from its side
   can add or terminate individual flows or terminate a complete session
   as required by the user.

   This document considers how PCN would interact with the RACF
   architecture just described.  Since that architecture is functional,
   various implementations are possible, depending on what elements are
   combined in the same physical entities.  This document looks at three
   possible deployment scenarios.  In all three cases, the PD-FE is
   implemented in a centralized device and the PE-FE is a functional
   component of the ingress nodes.  The scenarios vary in where the
   TRC-FE is implemented.

   1.  The TRC-FE is implemented both in one or more centralized devices
       (possibly combined with the PD-FE) and as a logical component of
       the ingress nodes.  Congestion level and flow termination reports
       from the egress nodes pass directly to the ingress nodes.  The
       TRC-FE in the centralized device is just a proxy that forwards
       requests and responses between the PD-FE and the ingress nodes.



Tsou, et al.               Expires May 3, 2009                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          PCN Applicability to RACF           November 2008


       The TRC-FE instances in the ingress nodes respond to flow
       admission requests from the PD-FE with indications of resource
       status derived from the PCN reports.  They process flow
       termination reports based on the priority parameters for existing
       flows that were supplied by the PD-FE during resource
       reservation, and send reports to the PD-FE indicating which flows
       or sessions must be terminated to protect the QoS of the
       remaining flows

   2.  The TRC-FE is absorbed into the ingress nodes and no centralized
       instance exists.  Congestion level and flow termination reports
       from the egress nodes pass directly to the ingress nodes.  The
       TRC-FE instances in the ingress nodes respond to flow admission
       requests and process flow termination reports in the same way as
       in Scenario 1.

   3.  The TRC-FE is implemented in one or more centralized devices only
       (possibly combined with the PD-FE).  It receives and processes
       the congestion level and flow termination reports and responds to
       flow admission requests in the same way as the distributed TRC-FE
       instances in the previous two scenarios.

   The following sections examine each of these scenarios in turn.
   Amongst other things, they will consider whether the message flow
   described in the previous section is appropriate or whether it should
   be modified.

3.  Scenario 1: Proxy and Ingress TRC-FE Instances

   The functional layout for Scenario 1 is shown in Figure 2 below.  The
   PCN reports pass across the existing Rc reference point between the
   embedded TRC-FE and the transport processing layer.  If probes are
   used, they also cross the Rc reference point.  The figure assumes
   that the PD-FE uses the proxy TRC-FE to locate the ingress node for a
   given user flow, and places the Rt and Rp reference points
   accordingly.

             Figure 2: Functional Architecture For Scenario 1

   If we follow through the message flows specified in Section 2.2, we
   find that they now run as follows:

   1.  Network status, but not network topology, is now determined from
       the PCN report message flows across Rc, as already noted.

   2.  Step 2 is unchanged.




Tsou, et al.               Expires May 3, 2009                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft          PCN Applicability to RACF           November 2008


   3.  Step 3 is unchanged.

   4.  Step 4 involves messaging through the Rt reference point to the
       proxy TRC-FE instance, and from there through the Rp reference
       point to the TRC-FE instance embedded in the desired ingress
       node.  If probing is used to determine congestion status, the
       probing messages are another increment to the messaging through
       the Rc reference point.  The responses to the probes pass back
       through Rc.

   5.  Step 5 is unchanged: a request from the PD-FE directly to the
       PE-FE instance in the ingress node, across Rw.

   Note that the messaging flow appears to be less than optimal, in that
   the PD-FE is really communicating twice with the ingress node - once
   to the embedded TRC-FE instance in step 4, then, based on a positive
   response, to the PE-FE instance in step 5.  Messaging could be
   reduced to one exchange if the PD-FE were aware in advance that it
   was communicating with a combined TRC-FE + PE-FE entity.  It is an
   open issue whether such a special-case modification of the general
   control architecture should be developed.

4.  Scenario 2: TRC-FE Present In Ingress Nodes Only

   The functional architecture corresponding to this scenario is shown
   in Figure 3.  The figure assumes that the PD-FE does not know which
   ingress node to contact until the TRC-FE instance it reached in the
   first place locates it.  It is plausible that the TRC-FE instance has
   the necessary knowledge simply because ingress nodes tend also to be
   egress nodes, and in this scenario the egress nodes have to know
   where to send their PCN reports.  As an alternative, the PD-FE could
   be required to have the necessary knowledge to locate the right
   ingress node directly.  However, this seems contrary to the spirit of
   the existing ITU-T architecture.

   Aside from the routing of messages between the PD-FE and the TRC-FE,
   this scenario is the same as Scenario 1.

5.  Scenario 3: Centralized TRC-FE Only

   In this scenario centralized TRC-FE instances collect PCN reports
   from egress nodes within their scope of responsibility.  As in the
   other scenarios, the TRC-FE instances track resource status, respond
   to inquiries from the PD-FE, and notify the PD-FE if flows have to be
   terminated.  However, since they are physically separate from the
   ingress nodes, there is no possibility of message optimization.  It
   is assumed in the figure that a given egress node sends all of its
   PCN reports to the same TRC-FE instance, which must then distribute
   them to the TRC-FE instances in charge of the various ingress nodes.
   Thus the PCN reports appear as incremental information flows Rc' and
   Rp' across the Rc and Rp reference points respectively.

             Figure 4: Functional Architecture For Scenario 3

   The first thing to note in Figure 4 is that the centralized TRC-FE
   reduces the scale of a problem already encountered in PCN operation:
   where to send the PCN reports?  In the straightforward case initially
   dealt with by the PCN Working Group, each egress node must know to
   which ingress node to send each of its flow reports.  Now the
   centralized TRC-FE has that problem, but the egress nodes only have

   to discover or be configured with the address of a single collection
   point.

   The information exchanges needed to admit a flow are pretty well
   those described in Section 2.2.  This scenario has one interesting
   point not seen in the other scenarios.  If probes are used, they must
   be sent from the ingress nodes rather than the TRC-FE instances.
   This raises the question of how they are triggered.  It seems
   inappropriate to require the PD-FE to be aware of the use of PCN in
   the domain, since it is supposed to operate in technology-independent
   fashion.  It makes more sense for the TRC-FE to trigger a probe at
   the PE-FE in response to a query from the PD-FE.  In terms of the
   ITU-T architecture, the trigger and response from the PE-FE would
   pass via the Rc reference point, but this is shown as Rc' in the
   figure because it represents an incremental requirement.

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the different scenarios described in
   this document are not fundamentally different from those already
   applying for PCN and for the ITU-T architecture respectively.  A more
   detailed analysis of specific issues may be appropriate as this
   document is further developed.
