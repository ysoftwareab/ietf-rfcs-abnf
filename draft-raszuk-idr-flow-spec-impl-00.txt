1.  Introduction

   Dissemination of flow specification rules BGP describes an extension
   to BGP which may be used to propagate information describing flows of
   data between BGP speakers.  Such information may be needed to apply
   action on selected data flows through and beyond autonoumus systems.
   Examples of such actions are: dropping, rate limiting, redirecting,
   monitoring etc ...

   This document provides an implementation report for Dissemination of
   flow specification rules as defined in draft-ietf-idr-flow-spec-01

   The editor did not verify the accuracy of the information provided by
   respondents or by any alternative means.  The respondents are experts
   with the implementations they reported on, and their responses are
   considered authoritative for the implementations for which their
   responses represent.
