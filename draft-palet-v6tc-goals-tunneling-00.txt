Internet-Draft      Goals for Tunneling Configuration      February 2005


Abstract

   This memo describes the set of goals for a tunneling setup protocol
   that could be used in several network cases to jumpstart its IPv6
   offering to its customers by providing them IPv6 connectivity through
   a simplistic tunneling mechanism.

   The basic network cases, which may have different sets of goals, are
   also introduced, including 3GPP and other Service Providers.  Two
   cases are analyzed in the Service Provider scenario, one which apply
   to simplistic mechanism where the user is already authenticated by
   other network existing means, and another which also takes care of
   the user authentication.

Internet-Draft      Goals for Tunneling Configuration      February 2005


1.  Introduction

   Regardless of which is the network that is involved in the transition
   from IPv4 to IPv6, generally this could involve several phases, often
   in different networks parts (i.e., core, access).

   The transition of the core network usually can be done in a much more
   easy way than the access network.  This is the case even if the core
   network is only connected via tunnels to other IPv6 networks.  The
   setup of those tunnels involves a small effort and is not a big
   trouble, even in the case of a manual configuration.

   However, this is not the case for the access network, which may
   involve different types of layer two technologies.  In all the cases,
   in order to facilitate the transition of those access networks, which
   will be impossible to do manually and efficiently, there is a need
   for an automatic IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneling mechanism.  The goal is to
   provide bidirectional IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneled connectivity between
   dual-stack end-nodes located at an IPv4-only access network and
   dual-stack tunnel servers located at IPv6/IPv4 network boundaries.

   This should be applicable to all kind of ISPs and access networks.
   They could be regular ISPs, providing service through DSL, PSTN,
   ISDN, cable, PLC or any other technologies, but could be also a
   wireless ISP, or even an enterprise with its own service provider
   infrastructure for the employees at remote locations.

   In order to simplify the text, "customers" is used in the rest of
   this document to refer to both Customers of Service Providers (3GPP,
   other ISPs) and users (Enterprise, others).

   In this document, the refereces to "Service Provider" is a general
   one, meaning whatever network/technology is used for providing access
   to IP connectivity.

   In the case of an ISP starting its IPv6 offering to its customers,
   without initially upgrading its access network to support IPv6, as
   indicated in section 5.1 of [3], could use a "tunnel brokering
   solution", as described in [5].  However the tunnel set-up protocol
   has been identified as a missing piece.

   Similarly, in an 3GPP, ISP or enterprise network, the provision of
   the native IPv6 connectivity to the customers/users, can take a long
   time and may be costly, while a tunneled infrastructure can be used
   as a low cost transition path, which can be deployed easily and in a
   short time, enabling progressive native IPv6 deployment when/where
   justified.

Internet-Draft      Goals for Tunneling Configuration      February 2005


   Such tunneling infrastructure can connect the customers/users to the
   IPv6 network using available production IPv6 address space, thus
   facilitating the transition towards native IPv6 deployment, so the
   roadmap may become:

   o  Tunneling infrastructure for early adopters.

   o  Native IPv6 to some customers/user groups once economically
      justified.

   o  Native IPv6 to all customers/users.

   "Tunneling Configuration" (TC) is used in this document to describe a
   protocol which takes care of the setup and maintenance of the
   bidirectional tunnel between a dual-stack end-node (or leaf network)
   and a dual-stack tunnel server.  The exchange of parameters needed
   for the setup and maintenance of the tunnel (such as address, prefix,
   routing, encapsulation, filtering, authentication, accounting, ...),
   should be automated to avoid manual user/operator intervention.

   The tunneling configuration protocol is envisaged to be deployed as
   an initial and temporary mechanism to provide basic IPv6 connectivity
   services only.  This basic IPv6 connectivity may be limited, in the
   sense than may be not 100% comparable to a native IPv6 service.
   However this basic IPv6 connectivity should be enough while it allows
   the communication through IPv6 during the transition phase, until the
   native IPv6 service is available, and consequently is expected that
   the tunneling will be phased out as soon as native IPv6 access
   service is available.

   This document analyzes the goals for a such tunnel setup protocol,
   taking in consideration the different possible common network cases
   for deploying IPv6.

2.  Terminology

   Tunneling-Configured Site (TCS): A logical network over which IPv6
   connectivity is provided by means of Tunneling Configuration.  At
   least one dual-stack node is required in this logical network.

   Tunnel End-Point (TEP): A dual-stack node performing IPv6-in-IPv4
   tunnel encapsulation/decapsulation in accordance with Tunneling
   Configuration.  There will be always two TEPs in order to establish
   the communication, the local one at the customer site (TCS) and the
   remote one at the ISP site.

   Tunnel Server (TS): A dual-stack server node with IPv6 connectivity
   and which provides IPv6 connectivity to client nodes by performing

Internet-Draft      Goals for Tunneling Configuration      February 2005


   IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnel encapsulation/decapsulation to/from client nodes
   in accordance with Tunneling Configuration.  A Tunnel Server is
   likely to be a dual-stack router, but could be also a node behaving
   as a router.  The TS is often the ISP TEP.

   Tunnel Client (TCL): A dual-stack node that obtains IPv6 connectivity
   by means of Tunneling Configuration.  A tunnel client relies on
   IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnel encapsulation/decapsulation to/from Tunnel
   Servers for IPv6 communications to native IPv6 nodes.  This is often
   the customer TEP.

   Direct Tunneling (DT): Direct tunnelling here refer to the case where
   end-hosts located within different Tunneling-Configured Sites, in the
   same ISP network, may circumvent the Tunnel Server and communicate
   directly using the tunnel protocol.

   CPE: Customer Premises Equipment.

3.  Assumptions and Prerequisites

   Tunneling Configuration may be applicable in different IPv6
   transition network cases.  The focus of this document is to define
   the goals to apply this mechanism in the Service Provider context
   making the following assumptions and prerequisites:

   o  The customer configuration may be diverse and not necessarily
      predictable.  Consequently the tunneling configuration protocol
      must be able to adapt to different cases or combinations of:

      *  The TCS is a single node or leaf network.

      *  The TCL at the TCS has a global IPv4 address or is behind one
         or more NATs.

      *  The TCL at the TCS has a static or dynamic IPv4 address.

      *  In case of NAT, the external IPv4 address is a static or
         dynamic.

      *  In case of NAT, it can be customer or ISP owned.

   o  IPv4 multicast is not widely available, so the tunnel
      configuration protocol should work in IPv4 network environments
      where IPv4 multicast is not provided.

   o  The tunnel configuration protocol should be simple to implement
      and easy to deploy.  In particular, it should not depend on any
      complex, yet to be designed, protocols or infrastructure pieces.



Palet, et al.            Expires August 18, 2005                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft      Goals for Tunneling Configuration      February 2005


   o  This tunneling configuration protocol is provided within a
      restrictive timescale, in the sense that it should be phased out
      as soon as native access can be provided.

   o  The tunneling configuration is a protocol to be used in the
      transition phase, thus does not need to be perfect.  As a matter
      of fact, making it perfect would be counter productive, as it
      would first delay its definition, then make its deployment more
      cumbersome and, last but not least, diminish the incentives to
      deploy native IPv6.  Furhermore, should not rely in a complex set
      of devices, which may not be readily available, and could even
      mean a more expensive cost than the support of native IPv6 itself.


4.  Goals of the Tunneling Configuration Protocol

   As introduced above, there are different ISP types and different
   access networks.  This means that that there are different goals
   related to different network cases and situations.  For instance,
   factors as presence of NAT or not, low/high bandwidth,
   expensive/cheap, strong internal access control or not, etc.

   Different access media or network cases brings up different sets of
   goals.  Obviously, once choice will be to create a protocol for each
   specific case, but this is not optimal.  Instead, the motivation of
   this document is to combine all the goals and look for a common
   solution, which can fit as much as possible and in the most optimal
   way, in all the cases.  Some of those goals could be conflictual and
   that need to be resolved as well.

   This section groups these different goals.

4.1  General

4.1.1  Simplicity

   The Tunneling Configuration protocol should be easy to implement,
   implying a lightweight protocol.  The protocol should provide a
   reasonable, even if limited, set of basic IPv6 connectivity features.

4.1.2  Easy to deploy and Easy to Phase-out

   The Tunneling Configuration protocol should be easy to deploy into
   the existing IPv4 and IPv6 network infrastructure.

   The Tunneling Configuration protocol should have no major impact on
   protocols and infrastructure nodes deployed in existing
   infrastructures providing IPv4 and native IPv6 connectivity.



Palet, et al.            Expires August 18, 2005                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft      Goals for Tunneling Configuration      February 2005


   The Tunneling Configuration protocol should coexist and work
   seamlessly together with any native IPv6 infrastructure that
   gradually may be implemented in the network.  The Tunneling
   Configuration protocol should have no negative implications on how
   such infrastructure is implemented.

   The Tunneling Configuration protocol should be easy to take out of
   service once native IPv6 is available.

4.2  Tunnel Set-up

4.2.1  Tunnel End-Point Auto-Discovery and tunnel establishment

   The tunnel protocol should provide a mechanism for the automated
   discovery of the Tunnel End-Point, by the virtue of which end-hosts
   automatically and at run-time can determine the IPv4 addresses of
   available Tunnel Servers.

   The discovery mechanism should rely on intrinsic services, read
   services already universally deployed, to the particular network
   environment.  It should not require the addition of additional IP
   network infrastructure elements for this function only.

   The mechanism should be fully dynamic in the sense that it must not
   require IP address information such as the IPv4 address of a Tunnel
   Server and/or the IPv6 address(es) to use for IPv6 connectivity to be
   configured on the Tunnel Clients beforehand.

   The analysis done in [11] may apply.

   The Tunneling Configuration protocol should provide for the set of
   IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnels, based on IPv6-in-IPv4 encapsulation as defined
   in [10], from dual-stack nodes, attached to IPv4-only networks, to
   Tunnel Servers.

   The IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnels and the IPv6 connectivity should be
   established in an automated manner, i.e., without requiring manual
   intervention at any of the tunnel end-points at tunnel establishment
   time.  We can typically describe it as a "plug and play" protocol,
   which can be triggered through the execution of a simple program.

4.2.2  Tunnel End-Point Reachability Detection

   The Tunneling Configuration protocol should allow for means for one
   tunnel end-point to verify the reachability of other tunnel
   end-points towards which it intends to send packets in a method
   similar to IPv6 NUD.




Palet, et al.            Expires August 18, 2005                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft      Goals for Tunneling Configuration      February 2005


   The unicast neighbor reachability discovery functions provided by
   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery ([6]), i.e., unicast NS/NA exchanges, should
   be supported on the tunnel link.

   It is preferable that a Tunnel Server monitors the reachability of
   the tunnel client towards which it is sending packets.  Full
   emulation of IPv6 NUD mechanism is however not an explicit goal.

4.2.3  Scalability and Load-Balancing

   In order to ensure the scalability of the tunnel service, in terms of
   not limiting the number of simultaneous connections to the service
   and consequently limiting possible service denial situations, it
   should be possible for a Service Provider to load-balance those
   connections among several available Tunnel Servers.

   Load balancing should be planned already during the early phases of
   deployment.  Given adequate planning it should be possible for an ISP
   to seamlessly deploy additional Tunnel Servers in order to support an
   increased amount of Tunnel Clients.

   This may be achieved, for example, by using the load balancing
   functions provided by the Tunnel Server End-point discovery mechanism
   as detailed in [12].

4.2.4  Latency in Set-up Phases

   In certain type of networks, keeping tunnels active all the time is
   not possible.  In such environments, the protocol must be able to
   set-up tunnels on demand when the IPv6 connectivity either natively
   or through tunneling is unavailable.  The tunnel will be set-up only
   once though for the tunnel client and not per session.

   The Tunneling Configuration protocol must then have a low enough
   latency to enable quasi-instant configuration.  Latency is usually a
   function of the number of packet exchanges required, so minimizing
   this parameter is important.

4.2.5  Tunnel Link Sustainability

   The tunnel link established in between a host deploying Tunneling
   Configuration and an associated Tunnel Server should be expected to
   remain in administrative active state for the lifetime of the IPv6
   address provided to the host.

   The Tunneling Configuration protocol should not mandate keep-alive
   messages to be transmitted by the host simply in order to sustain
   tunnel link connectivity.  However, this may be required when a



Palet, et al.            Expires August 18, 2005                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft      Goals for Tunneling Configuration      February 2005


   tunnel has to cross a NAT box.  In this case, the mapping established
   by the NAT must be preserved as long as the tunnel is in use.  This
   is usually achieved by sending keep-alive messages across the tunnel.

   Also, the same keep-alive messages can enable the ISP tunnel end
   point to perform garbage collection of its resources when tunnels are
   not in use anymore.  To enable those two functionalities, the tunnel
   set-up protocol must include the transmission of keep-alive messages.
   A client may choose not to send those messages (for example on 3GPP
   or ISDN type links).  In this case, the client should be able to
   handle a tunnel disconnect event and be able to restart the set-up
   phase to re-establish the tunnel.

4.2.6  NAT Traversal

   The Tunneling Configuration protocol should be able to detect the
   presence of one or more NATs in its path.

   The tunnel should be able to traverse NAT, if present, so it may be
   necessary to choose among several tunnel encapsulation protocols for
   the most optimal one.

4.2.7  Firewall Traversal

   Even if no NAT is in the tunnel path, there may be a firewall which
   prohibits proto-41.  In such case, the tunnel encapsulation selection
   based on NAT detection could select a tunnel that will not work.

   To cope with this situation, the Tunnel Configuration protocol
   implementation may allow a user to explicitly specify the desired
   tunnel encapsulation, regardless of the NAT detection process.

4.2.8  Use Native Connectivity when Available

   The node should not use the Tunneling Configuration protocol when
   native IPv6 connectivity is available.

   The fact that a node should not initiate the Tunneling Configuration
   protocol when native IPv6 connectivity is available is not considered
   to be a functional goal on the tunnel protocol per se.  For example,
   rather it is related to the activation and deactivation of the
   protocol.

4.3  IPv6 Configuration

4.3.1  IPv6 Address Assignment

   Assignment of at least one globally routable IPv6 unicast address

Internet-Draft      Goals for Tunneling Configuration      February 2005


   (/128) to the end-node should be supported.

   No goals are defined as to how address configuration should be
   performed.  This may be done based on stateless or stateful IPv6
   address configuration mechanisms or by some altogether different
   mechanism particular to the Tunneling Configuration protocol.

4.3.2  IPv6 Address Stability

   The IPv6 address is "transient" and may change, but the protocol
   should offer a mechanism to provide IPv6 address stability (for
   example, a cookie mechanism).  The implementation of this mechanism
   should allow this feature to be turned off.

   It is preferable that the address assignment provides a stable
   address, that is, an address that can be used for IPv6 connectivity
   for a certain amount of time rather than solely one address per
   higher layer session initiation.

4.3.3  IPv6 Prefix Delegation

   Prefix Delegation support may depend on the different deployment
   cases.  It is not however required that a Tunneling Configuration
   protocol supporting only basic requirements provides support for
   prefix delegation.

4.3.4  IPv6 DNS

   Dual-stack nodes could use both IPv4 and IPv6 DNS discovery
   mechanisms and both, IPv4 and IPv6 transport for DNS services.

   Consequently IPv6 DNS discovery and IPv6 transport for DNS services
   should not be a goal of the Tunneling Configuration protocol.

4.4  Implementation Considerations

4.4.1  Private and Public IPv4 Addresses

   The Tunneling Configuration protocol should work over IPv4 sites
   deploying both private and public IPv4 addresses.

   Furthermore, the Tunneling Configuration protocol should work with
   both dynamic and static IPv4 address allocation.

4.4.2  Extensibility

   The Tunneling Configuration protocol should be extensible to support
   tunnel encapsulation other than IPv6 in IPv4 and IPv6 in transport in



Palet, et al.            Expires August 18, 2005               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft      Goals for Tunneling Configuration      February 2005


   IPv4.  In particular, encapsulation of IPv4 in IPv6 or IPv6 in IPv6
   could be defined.

4.4.3  Stateful or Stateless

   By a stateful mechanism we mean a mechanism that require the Tunnel
   Server to maintain tunnel state per client it serves.

   Tunnel state here is considered to be any parameter kept by the
   server per client and without which the server is unable to serve the
   client (receive packets from/send packets to).

   Tunnel state must be distinguished from state used to optimize the
   packet delivery function of the tunnel server and which is kept in a
   fixed or upper limited amount of memory space, such as, e.g.,
   reachability information.

   It should be emphasized that this document makes no deliberate
   assumptions on whether a Tunneling Configuration protocol should be
   based on a stateful or stateless Tunnel Server mechanism.  Indeed it
   is anticipated that the goals of Tunneling Configuration as put
   forward here could be served both by a stateless as well as by a
   stateful mechanism.

4.5  Management and Security

4.5.1  Security

   The Tunneling Configuration protocol should not impose any new
   vulnerability to the existing network infrastructure.

   The Tunneling Configuration protocol should not impose any new
   vulnerability to the nodes implementing it than what is already
   present in existing multi-access IPv6 networks, where multiple hosts
   are served by the same router or possibly multiple routers.

4.5.2  Traceability

   In some environments, traceability is an important consideration.
   The Tunneling Configuration protocol should be instrumentable to
   enable the collection of usage data which can be used, for example,
   for capacity planning.

4.5.3  Registration

   The registration of credentials should be external to the Tunneling
   Configuration protocol.  The user may require registration prior to
   using this service (through some web based service or other means).



Palet, et al.            Expires August 18, 2005               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft      Goals for Tunneling Configuration      February 2005


   Alternatively, the service provider may use an existing
   authentication database to pre-register its users, or even not
   require registration at all, depending on the network configuration.

   In order to allow a service provider to use its existing
   authentication database, an implementation may provide hooks to
   facilitate integration with the ISP management infrastructure (e.g.
   RADIUS for AAA, billing).

   The protocol may send information about registration procedure when a
   non-registered client requests access to a registered mode (e.g.  URL
   to provider registration web page).

4.5.4  Authentication

   Authentication can be used to control that the user has access to the
   IPv6 services.

   The authentication mechanism supported should be compatible with
   standardized methods that are generally deployed.  In order to assure
   interoperability, at least one common authentication method should be
   supported.  Other authentication may be supported and should be
   negotiated between the client and server (e.g., SASL [13]).

4.5.5  Confidentiality

   Tunneling Configuration can be used across networks which are not
   under the service provider control (e.g., roaming users).  The
   Tunneling Configuration protocol should allow protection of the
   authentication data.  This can be achieve by selecting an
   authentication mechanism that protects the credentials (e.g.,
   digest-md5).

   Protecting the tunneled data (IPv6 in this case) should be possible,
   for instance by means of using IPsec tunneling.

4.5.6  Accounting

   The Tunneling Configuration should include tools for managing and
   monitoring the provided service.  Such information can be used to
   plan service capacity (traffic load) or billing information.

   Some useful accounting data are (not exhaustive list):

   o  Tunnel counters (traffic in/out).

   o  User utilization (tunnel uptime).




Palet, et al.            Expires August 18, 2005               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft      Goals for Tunneling Configuration      February 2005


   o  System logging (authentication failures, resource exhaustion,
      etc.).

   The interface used to provide such information can be through SNMP or
   an AAA protocol (e.g., RADIUS accounting).

5.  Applicability of the Tunneling Configuration to Different Network
   Cases

   Note: Section to be completed in a new version.

   The goals enumerated in the precedent section are not all necessarily
   applicable and not in the same degree to different network cases.
   However seems feasible to build a common ground to these different
   network cases in order to define a single Tunneling Configuration
   protocol, which can accommodate to the different combinations of
   those goals and network cases.

   The v6ops working group has identified and analyzed several
   deployment scenarios for IPv4/IPv6 transition mechanisms in various
   stages of the IPv6 deployment and its coexistence with IPv4.

   This work has been carried out for a number of different network
   environments each with their particular characteristics including
   3GPP [1], Unmanaged [2], ISP [3] and Enterprise networks [4].

   The following sub-sections basically look into those different
   network environments to provide an analysis of the common and
   uncommon goals.

5.1  3GPP Access Networks

   IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneling is envisaged to be deployed in 3GPP networks
   as an initial and temporary mechanism to provide limited and basic
   IPv6 connectivity services only.  The IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneling
   mechanism demanded by the 3GPP environment falls within the realm of
   Tunneling Configuration.

   Native IPv6-like 3GPP connectivity services, e.g.  services including
   flexible charging and quality of service on demand, will be feasible,
   in 3GPP environments by virtue of true native IPv6 only.  This is due
   to the interrelation between the native IPv6 3GPP service and various
   3GPP signaling interfaces.  The latter which is not envisaged
   upgraded to support the IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneling situation.

   It is important to note that the IPv6 connectivity provided by 3GPP
   Tunneling Configuration IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneling does not compare with
   the native IPv6 3GPP connectivity in terms of the services offered.



Palet, et al.            Expires August 18, 2005               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft      Goals for Tunneling Configuration      February 2005


   This differentiates the 3GPP IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneling transition case
   somewhat from some of the other transition scenarios considered in
   the IETF v6ops WG and unlike some of these scenarios, the 3GPP
   IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneling deployment case is not a case of progressive
   and gradual roll out of native IPv6-like services.  Rather, Tunneling
   Configuration will in the 3GPP environment be deployed for the
   following purposes:

   o  To provide temporary provisioning of basic IPv6 services, which
      users may deploy for the simplest IPv6 services only.

   o  To allow an Operator, possibly a native IPv6 enabled Operator, to
      provide basic IPv6 services to users roaming into foreign networks
      which supports IPv4 bearer connectivity only.

   The scope of Tunneling Configuration in the 3GPP network environment
   is restricted to an absolute minimal set of functions required to
   provide automatic IPv6 connectivity establishment to dual stack nodes
   by means of IPv6-in-IPv4 encapsulation as defined in [10] to Tunnel
   Servers.

   Tunneling Configuration in the 3GPP network environment does not
   attempt to provide emulation of the full set of native IPv6
   connectivity functions as defined by [14], [15] and [16].

   With this in mind the following goals are applicable to the 3GPP
   Access Networks:

5.1.1  Simplicity

   .

5.1.2  Automated IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnel establishment

   .

5.1.3  IPv6 Address Assignment and Prefix Delegation

   It is only an explicit goal to have a /128 address allocated for
   global connectivity on the tunnel link.

5.1.4

   .

5.1.5

   .

Internet-Draft      Goals for Tunneling Configuration      February 2005


5.1.6

   .

5.1.7

   .

5.2  Narrowband Access Networks

   Somehow this type of networks are very similar to the 3GPP case,
   because the main constrain is the low bandwidth and the high cost of
   the usage of the access network.  Examples of this are PSTN and ISDN
   access networks.

   .

5.3  Broadband Access Networks

   This is typically the case when an ISP is offering IPv6 connectivity
   to its customers, initially using controlled tunneling
   infrastructure, as described in section 5.1 "Steps in Transitioning
   Customer Connection Networks" of [3].

   .

5.4  Unmanaged Networks

   In unmanaged networks [2], Tunneling Configuration is applicable in
   the case A where a gateway does not provide IPv6 at all (section 3),
   and case C where a dual-stack gateway is connected to an IPv4-only
   ISP (section 5).

   In the case the link is not IPv4 capable, Tunneling Configuration is
   applicable by means of IPv4 in IPv6 tunneling.

   This will actually fall into the same set of goals as already
   described for narrow or broadband access networks, depending on the
   media.

5.5  Enterprise Networks

   In the enterprise scenario [4], Tunneling Configuration can be used
   to support both, remote users connecting to the enterprise network
   (section 7.5.2) and internal users if the native infrastructure is
   not yet available.
