3.    Introduction

[MHTML] specifies how to send packaged aggregate HTML objects in MIME
multipart format. This memo is an accompanying informational document,
intended to be an aid to developers. This document is not an Internet
standard.


4.    Implementation methods

The [MHTML] standard has been intentionally written to be implementable
both in cases where a HTML document viewer (web browser) and a program
receiving MIME objects, such as an email program, are combined, and when
they are separate programs. Implementation is of course easier if the
document viewer is combined with the MIME receiving client.

Below is described different implementation methods. Real
implementations may sometimes combine ideas from more than one of the
different methods described below.

Note: Some document viewers can take a whole document of "Content-Type:
message" or "Content-Type: multipart" as one single file to be
displayed. When such viewers are known to be used, the problems
described below become much easier to handle, just send the whole
combined MIME message as a single file to the viewer.

4.1   Method 1: Combining viewer and MIME receiving program

This is the architecturally simplest approach. A web-browser with a
built in MIME receiving program (such as an email program) will be able
to use its own document viewer capabilities to display HTML-formatted
messages. Since it is the same program, that program will more easily be
able to connect a URL in the HTML text to a body part in the message.

4.2   Method 2: Rewriting the HTML

    +----------+                           +--------+
    | Document |                           | Mail   |
    | viewer   |                           | client |
    +-------+--+                           +-+------+
            |                               |
         +--+-------------------------------+--+
         | +----------+  +--+  +--+            |
         | | Start    |  |  |  |  | Related    |        Figure 1
         | | HTML     |  |  |  |  | body part  |
         | | document |  |  |  |  | parts      |
         | +----------+  +--+  +--+            |
         +-------------------------------------+

If the document viewer is separate from the MIME receiving client, the
MIME client might turn over the HTML body part to the document viewer
and ask it to display it (Figure 1). One way of doing this is to store
the HTML body part in a file, and ask the document viewer to display
this file. If multipart/related is used, this can be implemented by
storing all the body parts within the multipart/related in an otherwise
empty folder/directory.

The mail client may have to rewrite the HTML, replacing URI-s with
(possibly relative) URL-s which the Document viewer can resolve as file
names in the same directory/folder where the HTML document itself is
stored when turning it over to the Document viewer. Problems with such
rewriting of URIs is discussed in chapter 5 below.

4.3   Method 3: Using a translation table

    +----------+                          +--------+
    | Document |                          | Mail   |
    | viewer   |                          | client |
    +-------+--+                          +-+------+
            |                              |
         +--+------------------------------+-+
         | +--------+  +--+  +--+            |
         | | Trans- |  |  |  |  | Related    |        Figure 2
         | | lation |  |  |  |  | body part  |
         | | table  |  |  |  |  | parts      |
         | +--------+  +--+  +--+            |
         +-----------------------------------+

An alternative to rewriting the HTML file before turning it over to the
Document viewer may be to use a translation table, in case the Document
viewer has the capability to use such a table to rewrite URL-s on the
fly while displaying the document (Figure 2). This requires that the
Document viewer is capable of receiving CID: URL-s and resolving them
using this translation table in the same way as for other URL-s.

4.4   Method 4: Using a proxy HTTP server to retrieve referenced body
parts

    +--------+       +-----------+       +--------+
    | Proxy  |       | Data base |       | Mail   |
    | web    |-------| of cached |-------| server |
    | server |       | objects   |       |        |
    +----+---+       +-----------+       +----+---+
         |                                    |
    +----+-----+                          +----+---+   Figure 3
    | Document |                          | Mail   |
    | viewer   |                          | client |
    +-------+--+                          +-+------+
            |                              |
         +--+------------------------------+-+
         |         Start HTML object         |
         +-----------------------------------+

Yet another method is to use a proxy web server, to which the document
viewer requests are sent, and which will then use the cached body parts
instead of normal web retrieval from the network (Figure 3). If the
Document viewer is set to use this proxy server for all URL-s, including
CID URL-s, no rewriting of the HTML will be necessary.

4.5   Method 5: Putting the mail client into a proxy HTTP server

     +--------+--------+
     | Proxy  | Mail   |
     |  HTTP  | client |
     | server |        |
     +--------+--------+
              |
        HTTP protocol              Figure 4
              |
         +----+-----+
         | Document |
         | Viewer   |
         +----------+

A mail client can also be included in an HTTP server (Figure 4). The
user will then not have to install any mail client software in his
personal computer, all the mail functionality is mapped on HTTP and HTML
elements.

4.6   Other methods

The mail client and the document viewer can of course communicate in
other ways, such as using inter-process communication.

4.7   Communication between document viewer and mail client

Many document viewers (web browsers) have API-s to allow other programs
to communicate with them. There is however no accepted real or de-facto
standard for such API-s, which means that a mail program which relies on
such API-s will only be able to use those document viewer, whose API
they support.

Note however, that most of the methods described above can be
implemented with a very minimal such API. The only API function needed
is to be able to tell a document viewer, when it is started, to open a
particular file. And this API function is a standardized part of the
operating system on most platforms. In particular, method 1 and 3 above
uses the functionality that a relative URL is resolved with the location
of the base document as base. This means that if the base document is a
file, relative URL-s will be resolved as FILE URL-s in the same
directory/folder where the HTML document itself is placed.

There is a need for buttons in the Web page which the user can use to
get back to the mail program again after reading the mail with the
document viewer. A common technique to achieve this is to define a new
MIME data type for this button. The document viewer is then configured
to transfer control to the mail client when the user pushes this button,
i.e. downloads a file of this new MIME type.

5.    Problems with rewriting URIs when copying HTML documents

Sending of HTML-formatted messages is based on the assumption that an
HTML documents, together with in-line objects like images, applets and
frames, can be copied into a MIME message. Such copying may require
rewriting of URIs containing references between the different message
parts. The MHTML standard [MHTML] has been carefully prepared to allow
existing web pages to be copied without such rewriting, through the use
of the Content-Base and Content-Location MIME content heading fields.

There is however a problem if the source HTML document contains relative
URIs in parameters to objects and applets, such as in the example below:

From: foo1@bar.net
To: foo2@bar.net
Subject: A simple example
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: multipart/related; boundary="boundary-example-1";
                 type=Text/HTML
Content-Base: "http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us"

--boundary-example 1
Content-Type: Text/HTML; charset=US-ASCII

  ... text of the HTML document...
<OBJECT
   CLASSID = "clsid:5220cb21-c88d-11cf-b347-00aa00a28331">
   <PARAM NAME="imageurl" VALUE="image.gif">
</OBJECT>
...etc...

--boundary-example-1
Content-Location: "image.gif"
Content-Type: IMAGE/GIF
Content-Transfer-Encoding: BASE64

R0lGODlhGAGgAPEAAP/////ZRaCgoAAAACH+PUNvcHlyaWdodCAoQykgMTk5
..etc...

--boundary-example-1--

Only the object might know that the imageurl parameter is a relative
URI.
It's nearly impossible for the HTML parser to understand that the
parameter is a relative URI.  Simply searching for "image.gif" is not
robust, as the string "image.gif" may be used elsewhere. URIs in scripts
can also have similar problems.

One might envisage even more difficult cases, an applet might take a
parameter "subject" and another parameter "range" and when
subject="auto" and range="1-5" it could compute, and try to use
auto1.gif, auto2.gif ... auto5.gif as relantive URLs.

Some implementation methods described in chapter 4 above, for example
method 2 described in chapter 4.2, may require rewriting of the URIs in
the HTML document.

There is no perfect solution to this problem.

One way of alleviating the problem is to produce the original document
using only absolute URIs, preferably of the CID type, since they are
more easily identifiable.

Another way of alleviating the problem is to make all URIs and
Content-Locations into simple relative URIs containing file names only
(without paths, preferably using a file name format common to most
platforms, i.e. 1-6 ascii letters or digits, a period, and 1-3 extension
ascii letters or digits). An implementation using method 2 described in
chapter 4.2 above can then just store the parts as files in an empty
directory on the recipient computer with the Content-Locations as file
names, and then turn the start HTML file over to a document viewer, and
need not rewrite the URIs at all. This simple variant of use of the
MHTML standard is probably most robust, and those implementors who can
control the production of the HTML documents to be sent are thus
recommended to use this variant.


6.    Caching of body parts

Suppose a message contains body parts with the Content-Location header
as defined in [MHTML]. A receiving agent might then put this body part
into a web cache, with the URI in the Content-Location as its name, so
that later retrievals of this URI use the cached body parts. There is
however no guarantee that such a cached item is correct. Such caching is
thus not recommended for use in other ways than for resolution of links
within one particular MIME message.

The MHTML standard does not cover links between different messages, but
if you want to implement this, use of Content-ID and/or Message-ID,
rather than Content-Location, is recommended.

If incoming messages are stored in a store where messages can be
automatically deleted (purged), purging of body parts should not occur
before purging of the whole message, to which they belong.

If an incoming message contains a body part which is linked via Content-
Location, then no HTTP lookup should be performed to check if the body
part is recent. The message should thus still contain the old HTML
document, even if the HTTP-available document has been revised.
(Example: "Here is the weather map of October 29, 1997"). Exception from
this is:

(a) If the linked document is not enclosed in the message, but referred
    to via Content-Type: message/external-body, then the latest version'
    should be shown using ordinary HTTP caching conventions.

(b) If a new message is sent with a Supersedes reference to the old
    message, the old message should still show the old version of all
    the body parts, but it might be wise to inform the user that a
    superseding message is available.


7.    Recipients which cannot handle the Multipart/related Content-Type

A message sent according to the specifications in [MHTML] may have
recipients, whose mailers cannot handle the Multipart/related
Content-Type in the way specified in [MHTML].

According to [MIME1] a mailer which encounters an unknown subtype to
Multipart, should handle this as Multipart/mixed.

To improve this, Multipart/alternative can be used as discussed in
section 8 of this memo.

Content-Disposition, as specified in [CONDISP] and in [MHTML], section
10, can also be used as an aid to mailers which do not understand
Multipart/related.

Captions on images, which are included in the HTML text, might for
non-HTML-capable recipients be found in the Content-Description header
[CONDISP]. Do not assume, however, that HTML-capable user agents will
display the Content-Description header, they may assume that this
information is included in the HTML text instead.


8.    Use of the Content-Type: Multipart/alternative

If the message is sent to recipients, all of which may not have mailers
capable of handling the Text/HTML content-type, then the "Content-Type:
Multipart/Alternative" [MIME1] can be used in two ways:

8.1   Multipart/alternative inside Multipart/related

The Multipart/alternative is put inside the "Content-Type
Multipart/related", body parts can be specified with "Content-Type:
Text/plain" as the first choice, and "Content-Type: Text/HTML" as the
second choice.

Example:

   Content-Type: Multipart/related; boundary="boundary-example-1";
                 type=MULTIPART/ALTERNATIVE

      --boundary-example 1
      Content-Type: MULTIPART/ALTERNATIVE
      Boundary: boundary-example-2

         --boundary-example-2
         Content-Type: Text/plain

         ... plain text version of the document for recipients
         whose mailers cannot handle Text/HTML ...

         --boundary-example-2
         Content-Type: Text/HTML; charset=US-ASCII
         Content-ID: content-id-example@example.host

         ... text of the HTML document ...

         --boundary-example-2--
      --boundary-example-1
      Content-Type: Image/GIF

      ... a body part, to which the HTML document has a link  ...
      --boundary-example-1--

Note that the type parameter of Multipart/related in this case should be
Multipart/alternative and not Text/HTML.

8.2   Multipart/alternative outside Multipart/related

The multipart/alterantive is put outside the Multipart/Related, with
Multipart/Related as one alternative and Multipart/Mixed as the other
alternative. Note however that the [MHTML] does not recommend links from
inside Multipart/Related to objects outside of the Multipart/Related, so
putting inline images outside the Multipart/Related is not suitable.
Instead, such inline images may have to repeated in both branches of the
multipart/alternative with this method.

Example:

   Content-Type: MULTIPART/ALTERNATIVE
   Boundary: boundary-example-1

   --boundary-example-1
      Content-Type: Multipart/mixed; boundary="boundary-example-3"

      --boundary-example-3
         Content-Type: Text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

         ... plain text version of the message for recipients
         whose mailers cannot handle Text/HTML ...

      --boundary-example-3
      Content-Type: Image/GIF

         ... A picture associated with the plain text message  ...
      --boundary-example-3--

   --boundary-example-1
      Content-Type: Multipart/related; boundary="boundary-example-1";
                    type=Text/HTML

      --boundary-example 2
         Content-Type: Text/HTML; charset=US-ASCII
         Content-ID: content-id-example@example.host

         ... text of the HTML document ...

      --boundary-example-2
      Content-Type: Image/GIF

         ... a body part, to which the HTML document has a link  ...
      --boundary-example-2--
   --boundary-example-1--

8.3   Comparing the two methods

When choosing between these two methods of employing
multipart/alternative, note the following:

 (1) Clients which do not support Multipart/related, and which thus will
     interpret it as Multipart/mixed, will with choice 8.1 display
     the inline objects. Thus, a recipient whose mailer can handle
     image/gif but not multipart/related will still be shown the images,
     they will not be suppressed by being inside a suppressed branch of
     the Multipart/alternative.

 (2) Choice 8.2 will not show inline images in the Multipart/Related,
     unless this information is repeated in both branches of the
     Multipart/Alternative.

A general warning: Some mailers do not support "Content-Type:
Multipart/alternative", and may then interpret it as Multipart/mixed.


9.    Recipient may not have full Internet connectivity

The recipient of a message sent by email may not always have full
Internet connectivity. The recipient may be behind a gateway or firewall
which prohibits or restricts Internet connectivity.

This means that the recipient may not be able to resolve URI-s in an
email message, unless the referred-to documents are included in the
email message itself. Thus, it is often suitable to include in an email
message all documents which are referred to (directly or indirectly) by
URI-s in the message. This may of course not always be possible, in some
cases the set of referred-to documents (directly or indirectly) may be
the whole WWW document space, i.e. millions of documents. A choice must
then be made how much to include. Of course, it is most important to
include all inline objects, i.e. objects linked by such hyperlinks as
IMG, etc., which specify that the linked objects are to be shown to the
user immediately.

In the case of ACTION elements in HTML forms, by making these ACTION
elements of the "mailto:" URL type, rather than the "http:" URL type,
you will enable also recipients without full Internet connectivity to
fill in and send in your forms. The HTML specification [HTML2] allows
default action when no ACTION element is included, but this default
action may not be suitable when sending the HTML document via email.
Thus, it is better to always put an explicit ACTION element into HTML
forms sent by email.

In choosing between these two representation methods, note the following
effects:

(1) Modifying HTML markup may disrupt security content integrity checks.

(2) The choice of modifying HTML markup may be more suitable for
    recipients whose mailers do not support MIME.

(3) Using MIME Content-Transfer-Encoding may be more suitable for
    recipients who have MIME-compliant mailers but do pass the text over
    to a document viewer (web browser).


11.    Conversion from HTTP to MIME

Information received or retrieved using HTTP cannot always be sent
unchanged as email using the "Content-Type: Text/HTML", because of the
restrictions which MIME places on the format of "Content-Type:
Text/HTML". The same problem may occur for documents retrieved via HTTP,
which are in other textual formats than HTML. In particular, note the
following:

(a) Content-encodings allowed in HTTP, but not allowed in MIME, must be
removed.

(b) HTTP allows line breaks as bare CRs or bare LFs or something else,
while MIME only allows line breaks as CRLF in subtypes of the Text
content-type.

(c) HTTP allows character sets like Unicode-1-1, which do not represent
line breaks as CRLFs, such text may have to be rewritten to character
sets like Unicode-1-1-UTF-7 in which line breaks are represented as
CRLFs.

A good overview of the differences, with regard to the use of
"Content-Type: Text", between MIME and HTTP, can be found in [HTTP]
appendix C.

If you want to send HTTP unchanged via email, you might consider using
the "Content-Type: Message/HTTP" instead of the "Content-Type:
Text/HTML".

13.   References

Temporary note: This list contains some references to Internet drafts.
It is anticipated that these Internet drafts will become RFC-s before
this memo. The references will then in this memo be changed to refer to
the corresponding RFC instead. This list also includes some RFC-s which
are not up to date, and which will be replaced by new memos presently in
ietf draft status.
