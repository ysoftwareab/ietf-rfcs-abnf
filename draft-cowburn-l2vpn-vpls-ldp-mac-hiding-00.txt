Abstract 
   
  This document describes a mechanism for hiding customer MAC 
  addresses on a PE-rs in an H-VPLS environment.  In the H-VPLS 
  hierarchy, a PE-rs is exposed to the MAC addresses for customers on 
  its directly attached MTU-s and the remote MAC addresses for all of 
  its configured VPLS instances.  This can result in the requirement 
  to store a large number of a MAC addresses.  
  This document introduces the concept of an MTU-id per MTU-s which is 
  included with the customer frame sent by an MTU-s.  The PE-rs is 
  then able to switch based on the MTU-id rather than the customer MAC 
  addresses, thereby reducing the address storage requirements on the 
  PE-rs to be of the order of the number of MTU-s.

Internet Draft    MAC Hiding in an H-VPLS Environment      August 2006 

4. Introduction 
 
  The Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) solution [VPLSLDP] includes a 
  hierarchical model to provide hub and spoke connectivity and thus 
  more scalability in terms of the number of devices in a VPLS network. 
   
  In such an H-VPLS network, the MTU-s must learn all of the MAC 
  addresses related to its directly connected customers in order to 
  perform the correct switching, therefore MAC hiding is not possible 
  on the MTU-s. 
   
  The PE-rs is also exposed to customer MAC addresses as it terminates 
  pseudowires from the MTU-s and other PE-rs.  Therefore the PE-rs 
  needs to learn MAC addresses for customers on its directly attached 
  MTU-s and the remote MAC addresses for all of its configured VPLS 
  instances.  This can result in the requirement to store a large 
  number of a MAC addresses. When H-VPLS is extended to multi-domain, 
  the border PE-rs needs to learn MAC addresses for all of its inter-
  domain customers, possibly leading to an even larger storage 
  requirement. 
   
  To reduce the MAC storage requirements on the PE-rs, each MTU-s is 
  assigned an identifier (MTUid) which is included with the customer 
  frames sent from the MTU-s.  After learning the MTUids related to a 
  given customer, the PE-rs is able to switch frames based on the 
  destination MTUid for that customer.  At this point, the PE-rs need 
  only learn MTUids and not all of the MAC addresses on the MTU-s.   
  This will drastically reduce the storage requirements on the PE-rs 
  with a scaling of the order of NxC (N=number of MTU-s per customer, 
  C=number of customers). 
   
  The mechanism described aims to utilize existing protocols and 
  standards as far as possible, minimize the additional overhead per 
  frame and maintain the current forwarding paradigm used for 
  switching L2 frames.  It also continues with the benefits of an MPLS 
  based infrastructure, such as fast failover and traffic engineering. 
  Consideration is given to interoperating with non-MAC-hiding capable 
  devices.  A description of how an existing network could be migrated 
  to MAC hiding is given in an appendix. 
   

5. Overview 
   
  Each device participating in the MAC hiding mechanism in the H-VPLS 
  network is assigned a unique identifier (MTUid).  This is a 14 bit 
  number which needs to be managed and assigned by the service 
  provider, allowing approximately 16 thousand MTU-s per H-VPLS 
  network (noting that some of the MTUid space is reserved). 
   
  The destination and source MTUids are sent using a pseudowire 
  control word of a new type that is pre-pended to customer frames. 

Cowburn                Expires 28 February, 2007             [Page 3] 
Internet Draft    MAC Hiding in an H-VPLS Environment      August 2006 

  [RFC4385] currently defines two code points, 0x0 and 0x1.  This 
  proposal extends [RFC4385] by introducing a new code point. This 
  results in an extra 4 byte overhead for customer frames using the 
  MAC hiding mechanism.  The ability to send and receive frames 
  containing this control word is signaled via LDP. 
   
  The MTU-s sends frames with the control word to the adjacent PE-rs 
  on a customer specific pseudowire.  The PE-rs receives these frames, 
  removes the MPLS header and examines the control word. The source 
  MTUid (if unknown) is learned and then the frame is forwarded 
  (including the control word) on the appropriate pseudowire towards 
  the MTU-s identified by the destination MTUid.  When the frame is 
  received by the egress MTU-s, the MPLS headers and control word are 
  removed, the source MTUid learned (if unknown) and the frame is sent 
  to the destination customer based on the input pseudowire, VLAN and 
  destination MAC address. 
   
  The following sections will describe the format of the control word 
  added, the signaling of the MAC hiding capability and the detailed 
  operation of the network using MAC hiding. 
   

6. MAC Hiding Control Word Format 
 
  The MAC Hiding control word (MHCW) used to carry the MTUids with the 
  customer frames is based on the definition in [RFC4385], the format 
  is as follows: 
     
   0                   1                   2                   3 
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
  |x x x x|        dest MTUid         |         src MTUid         | 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   
  Bits 0 to 3 represent a new code point to indicate the use of the 
  MHCW. Its value will be assigned by IANA (e.g. 0x2). 
   
  Bits 4 to 17 represent the destination MTUid.  This will be either 
  the MTUid of the destination MTU-s for unicast traffic, or one of 
  the reserved MTUids for broadcast/multicast traffic. 
   
  Bits 18 to 31 represent the source MTUid.  This will be the MTUid of 
  the source MTU-s. 
   

7. Reserved MTUids  
   
  The following MTUids are reserved 
   
  3FFF      Destination MTUid for broadcast MAC destination 


Cowburn                Expires 28 February, 2007             [Page 4] 
Internet Draft    MAC Hiding in an H-VPLS Environment      August 2006 

  3FFE      Destination MTUid for multicast MAC destination 
  3FFD      Destination MTUid for unknown MAC destination 
  3F00-3FFC Future use 
   
  The broadcast destination MTUid MUST be supported and it MUST be 
  used for broadcast frames.  The broadcast MTUid SHOULD by default 
  also be used for multicast and unknown destination frames, 
  alternatively, the multicast and unknown destination MTUids MAY be 
  supported for multicast and unknown destination frames respectively. 
  A device not supporting the multicast or unknown MTUids MUST process 
  them when received in the same way as the broadcast MTUid. 
   
  The broadcast, multicast and unknown MTUids MUST not be used for the 
  source MTU-id. 
   
  Uniquely identifying broadcast, multicast and unknown destinations 
  would allow control and visibility of these frames types on the PE-
  rs, e.g. for statistics gathering. 
   
  Section 13 describes the operation for these MTUids. 
   

8. Signaling MAC hiding capability via LDP 
   
  The ability to send and receive frames with a control word 
  containing the source and destination MTUid is signaled via an 
  optional parameter in the PWid FEC TLV (FEC=128) or in an Interface 
  Parameters TLV in the LDP Generalized PWid FEC TLV(FEC 129) as a 
  sub-TLV as defined in [RFC4447]. 
   
  The MAC hiding parameter ID is defined in [RFC4446] (to be assigned). 
   
  0                   1                   2                   3 
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
  |    Sub-TLV    |     Length    |             MTUid         |0|0| 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   
  Bits 0 to 7 represent the sub-TLV type and MUST be set to 0x0D 
  (subject to IANA approval).  This identifies the MAC hiding 
  parameter ID.  
   
  Bits 8 to 15 represent the length of the interface parameter 
  including the parameter id and length field itself.  This MUST be 
  set to 0x04 
   
  Bits 16 to 29 represent the MTUid of this device. 
   
  If both peers indicate the support of MAC hiding by including this 
  parameter then control words MUST be added/removed to/from frames 
  switched on this pseudowire after it has been enabled.  If both

Internet Draft    MAC Hiding in an H-VPLS Environment      August 2006 

  peers do not indicate the support of MAC hiding the PW MUST NOT be 
  enabled. 
   

9. Customer separation 
   
  Pseudowires are used to provide customer separation, specifically 
  the traffic for each customer is switched in a single pseudowire 
  between each MTU-s/PE-rs.  Consequently the MTUids are learned on 
  the PE-rs on a pseudowire basis, i.e. MTUids are learned for each 
  set of pseudowires belonging to a given customer, hence minimising 
  storage requirements on the PE-rs for MTUids. 
   
  Since PE-rs are VLAN-unaware, flooding can be sub-optimal.  If all 
  of the customer's VLANs span all of its sites then this is not an 
  issue, however, if this is not the case then traffic may be flooded 
  to an MTU-s/PE-rs on which its VLAN is not configured. 
   
  Three options are possible: 
   
  a) If the amount of flooding is minimal, then maintain a pseudowire 
     per customer with traffic flooded to an MTU-s/PE-rs without the 
     VLAN(s) concerned.  The MTU-s/PE-rs would drop this traffic.  
  b) Use a set of pseudowires per customer topology (instead of per 
     customer).  This will result in optimal flooding but will 
     increase the storage requirements for MTUids to the order of NxT 
     (N=number of MTU-s per customer, T=number of topologies). 
  c) Allow learning on MTUids on the PE-rs per VLAN per pseudowire. 
     This will result in optimal flooding but will increase the 
     storage requirements for MTUids to the order of NxCxV (N=number 
     of MTU-s per customer, C=number of customers, V=number of VLANs 
     per customer). 
   
  Option (a) will use bandwidth un-necessarily while options (b) and 
  (c) will require more storage space for MTUids. 
   

10. Maintaining the forwarding paradigm 
 
  In order to preserve existing frame forwarding implementations based 
  on destination MAC address lookup, as defined in [VPLSLDP], a PE-rs 
  MAY pre-pend a locally significant OUI to the MTUids to expand the 
  MTUid to 48 bits for internal processing, i.e. pre-pend a 34 bit 
  value.  This allows the PE-rs to internally treat the MTUids in the 
  same manner as MAC addresses, specifically the learning, switching 
  and aging mechanisms of standard L2 forwarding can be preserved. 
  Note that this pre-pended OUI is only locally significant so is not 
  included with the MTUids in frames sent out of the PE-rs.

Internet Draft    MAC Hiding in an H-VPLS Environment      August 2006 

11. Handling Broadcast, Unknown and Multicast 
 
  Broadcast frames MUST be sent by the MTU-s using the broadcast MTUid 
  and these frames are flooded by the PE-rs to all pseudowires 
  belonging to this customer. 
   
  Unknown and multicast frames SHOULD by default be sent by an MTU-s 
  using the broadcast MTUid and be flooded by the PE-rs to all 
  pseudowires belonging to this customer. 
    
  The multicast MTUid MAY be used when a more efficient distribution 
  of multicast traffic is needed.  This is for further study. 
   
  The unknown MTUid type MAY be used when it is useful to separately 
  identify unknown unicast destination traffic at the PE-rs.  This is 
  for further study. 
   
  Section 7 defined these reserved MTUids. 
   

12. MAC Withdraws 
 
  [VPLSLDP] defines the processing for flushing learned MAC addresses 
  using MAC withdraws with a MAC list TLV containing explicit MAC 
  addresses or with an empty MAC list TLV. Given that PE-rs do not 
  learn the customer MAC addresses when using MAC hiding, the MAC list 
  TLV containing explicit MAC addresses SHOULD not be sent by an MTU-s 
  on a pseudowire using MAC hiding. 
   
  An MTU-s MAY send an empty MAC list TLV and the processing on the 
  PE-rs would continue as defined in [VPLSLDP]. 
   
  As the source MTUid in the MHCW identifies the MTU-s involved in the 
  topology change, a new MAC withdraw option is defined to allow the 
  flushing of MAC addresses to be specific to the MTU-s concerned in 
  the topology change. 
 

12.1. Optional MTUid TLV in MAC withdraw 
 
  A new MTUid TLV is defined which MAY be included as an optional 
  parameter in the LDP Address withdraw message, as defined in 
  [RFC3036], with an empty MAC list TLV.  The MTUid TLV contains the 
  MTUid of the device generating the MAC withdraw.  The format is as 
  follows and is based on the standard LDP TLV encoding as defined in 
  [RFC3036]

  U bit: Unknown bit. This bit MUST be set to 1.  
   
  F bit: Forward bit. This bit MUST be set to 0.  Since the LDP 
  mechanism used here is targeted, the TLV MUST NOT be forwarded.  
      
  Type: Type field. This field MUST be set to 0x0002 (subject to IANA 
  approval).  This identifies the TLV type an MTUid TLV.  
      
  Length: Length field.  This field specifies the total length in 
  octets of the MTUid in the TLV.  The length MUST be 2. 
   

12.2. Processing MTUid TLV 
   
  The MTUid TLV MAY be added to MAC withdraw message containing an 
  empty MAC list TLV when such a message is sent by an MTU-s over a 
  pseudowire on which MAC hiding is enabled (see section 8). 
   
  When a PE-rs receives a MAC withdraw containing an MTUid TLV it 
  flushes the specified MTUid, or alternatively a more optimal action 
  is to move the association of the MTUid (if one exists) to the 
  pseudowire on which the MAC withdraw was received.  If the PE-rs is 
  operating in MTU-s mode (see section 13.2) the MTUid TLV MUST be 
  ignored and the empty MAC list TLV processed as defined in [VPLSLDP]. 
   
  Note that if a PE-rs receives a MTUid TLV and does not support or 
  understand it, it MUST ignore the message. 
      

13. Operation of MAC Hiding 
  This section describes the detailed operation for MAC hiding on an 
  MTU-s and a PE-rs. 
   

13.1. On an MTU-s 
   
  When a customer frame is to be switched from a local port to a PE-rs, 
  the MTU-s firstly learns the source MAC address of the frame in the 
  related VLAN as it would with standard H-VPLS, this is used to 
  forward frames back to that source address. 
   



Cowburn                Expires 28 February, 2007             [Page 8] 
Internet Draft    MAC Hiding in an H-VPLS Environment      August 2006 

  The MTU-s MUST then pre-pend a MHCW before forwarding it on the 
  pseudowire to the PE-rs. The MHCW MUST contain the MTU-id of this 
  MTU-s as the source MTUid and one of the following for the 
  destination MTUid 
   
  a) If the frame has a destination MAC of ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff then the 
     destination MTUid MUST be 3FFF 
  b) If the frame destination MAC is a multicast address then the 
     destination MTUid MUST be either 3FFF or 3FFE 
  c) If the frame destination MAC is an unknown address then the 
     destination MTUid MUST be either 3FFF or 3FFD 
  d) If the destination MAC has been learned in this VLAN from a 
     remote MTU-s/PE-rs then the destination MTUid MUST be set to the 
     MTUid of that remote device. 
   
  When a customer frame is received from a PE-rs on a pseudowire, the 
  MPLS header and MHCW are removed.  The frame is then switched to the 
  customer port(s) based on the destination MAC address and VLAN.  The 
  MTU-s MUST maintain a mapping between the source MAC of the received 
  frame and the pseudowire/VLAN and source MTUid.  This mapping is 
  used to obtain the destination MTUid when sending frames to this 
  source MAC for this pseudowire/VLAN combination. 
   

13.2. On a PE-rs 
  When a frame is received on a pseudowire, the MPLS header is removed 
  and the MHCW examined. 
   
  If the source MTUid is unknown on this pseudowire, then this MTUid 
  is learned to be reachable via this inbound pseudowire.  
   
  The frame is switched, together with the received MHCW (i.e. the 
  MHCW remains unchanged), as follows: 
   
  a) If the destination MTUid is 3FFF or 3FFD, or if the destination 
     MTUid is unknown, the frame MUST be flooded to all other 
     pseudowires belonging to this customer as defined by the normal 
     H-VPLS procedures. 
  b) If the destination MTUid is 3FFE the frame SHOULD be flooded to 
     all other pseudowires belonging to this customer as defined by 
     the normal H-VPLS procedures.  Note that allowing a more 
     efficient distribution of multicast is for further study. 
  c) If the destination MTUid has been learned on a pseudowire for 
     this customer, the frame is forwarded on that pseudowire. 
   
  The PE-rs MAY be VLAN-aware, in which case the MTUid learning and 
  frame forwarding is based on pseudowire AND VLAN.

13.3 On a PE-rs with Directly Connected Customers 
   
  If a PE-rs has directly connected customers then it must be exposed 
  to the MAC addresses associated with those customers in order to 
  switch their frames correctly.  Therefore the PE-rs MUST operate in 
  MTU-s mode for these customers, i.e. the PE-rs performs the MAC 
  hiding operation of an MTU-s.  While this allows directly connected 
  customers, it also eliminates the benefits of MAC hiding on this PE-
  rs for this customer. 
   

14. Interoperability with Non MAC Hiding Devices 
 
  An MTU-s without MAC hiding support can be connected to a PE-rs 
  using MAC hiding.  The PE-rs will operate in MTU-s mode for the 
  customers residing on this MTU-s, loosing the benefits of MAC hiding 
  for these customers only on this PE-rs. 
   
  Similarly, a PE-rs without MAC hiding support it can be connected to 
  other PE-rs using MAC hiding.  The non-MAC hiding PE-rs will operate 
  in MTU-s mode for the customers residing on it and it's directly 
  connected MTU-s.  Again the benefits of MAC hiding are lost for 
  these customers throughout the H-VPLS network.

16. Security Considerations  
       
  This document does not introduce new security issues.  The security 
  considerations pertaining to the original [VPLSLDP] specification 
  remain relevant. 
   

17. IANA Considerations  
      
  The code point used to indicate the use of the control word for MAC 
  hiding is defined as 0x2 in section 6 and is subject to IANA 
  approval.  
   
  The MAC hiding parameter ID used to signal the MAC hiding capability 
  is defined as 0x0X in section 8 and is subject to IANA approval.

19. Appendix: Adding MAC Hiding to an H-VPLS Network 
 
  The following are proposed steps to add MAC hiding to an existing H-
  VPLS network. 
 
  a) Upgrade the devices to MAC hiding capable software 
  b) Configure the MTUid on the devices, with directly connected 
     customers, that are performing MAC hiding 
  c) Enable MAC hiding on the pseudowires 
     This signals the MAC hiding capability to the LDP peer.  If both 
     peers support MAC hiding then control words MUST be added/removed 
     to/from frames switched on this pseudowire. 
     It SHOULD be possible to view the relationship between the MAC 
     addresses/VLANs/pseudowire and the MTUids to verify their mapping 
     is correct. 
  d) Enable switching frames on the PE-rs based on MTUids instead of 
     MAC addresses.  This can be enabled 
     a. EITHER On an on-going basis as pseudowires are enabled for MAC 
       hiding.  If a PE-rs has any pseudowire for a given customer 
       that is not MAC hiding enabled then it MUST operate as an MTU-
       s for that customer, specifically it MUST forward frames on 
       the non-MAC hiding pseudowires without a control word. 
     b. OR When all pseudowires for this customer on all MTU-s/PE-rs 
       have MAC hiding enabled.  This would allow verification of the 
       MAC addresses/VLANs/pseudowire to MTUids mapping before 
       switching based on MTUids.
