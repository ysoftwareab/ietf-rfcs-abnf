Abstract

   Elliptic curves with pairing are useful tools for constructing
   cryptographic primitives.  In this memo, we specify domain parameters
   of Barreto-Naehrig curve (BN-curve) [5].  The BN-curve is an elliptic
   curve suitable for pairings and allows us to achieve high security
   and efficiency of cryptographic schemes.  This memo specifies domain
   parameters of two 254-bit BN-curves [1] [2] which allow us to obtain
   efficient implementations and domain parameters of 224, 256, 384, and
   512-bit BN-curves which are compliant with ISO/IEC 15946-5[3].
   Furthermore, this memo organizes differences between types of
   elliptic curves specified in ISO document and often used in open
   source softwares, which are called M-type and D-type
   respectively[21].

1.  Introduction

   Elliptic curves with a special map called a pairing or bilinear map
   allows cryptographic primitives to achieve functions or efficiency
   which cannot be realized by conventional mathmatical tools.  There

   are identity-based encryption (IBE), attribute-based encryption
   (ABE), ZSS signature, broadcast encryption (BE) as examples of these
   primitives.  IBE realizes powerful management of public key by
   allowing us to use a trusted identifier as a public key.  ABE
   provides a rich decryption condition based on boolean functions and
   attributes corresponding to a secret key or a ciphertext.  The ZSS
   signature gives shorter size of signature than that of ECDSA.  BE
   provides an efficient encryption procedure in a broadcast setting.

   Some of these cryptographic schemes based on elliptic curves with
   pairing were proposed in the IETF (e.g. [6], [7], and [8]) and used
   in some protocols (e.g. [9], [10], [11], [12], and [13]).  These
   cryptographic primitives will be used actively more in the IETF due
   to their functions or efficiency.

   We need to choose an appropriate type of elliptic curves and
   parameters for the pairing-based cryptographic schemes, because the
   choice has great impact on security and efficiency of these schemes.
   However, an RFC on elliptic curves with pairings has not yet been
   provided in the IETF.

   In this memo, we specify domain parameters of Barreto-Naehrig curve
   (BN-curve) [5].  The BN-curve allows us to achieve high security and
   efficiency with pairings due to an optimum embedding degree.  This
   memo specifies domain parameters of two 254-bit BN-curves ([1] and
   [2]) because of these efficiencies.  These BN-curves are known as
   efficient curves in academia and particularly provide efficient
   pairing which is generally slowest operation in pairing-based
   cryptography.  There are optimized source codes of ([1] and [2]) as
   open source softwares ([19] and [20]), respectively.  Furthermore,
   this memo specifies domain parameters of 224, 256, 384, and 512-bit
   curves which are compliant with ISO document [3] and organizes
   differences between types of elliptic curves specified in ISO
   document and used in open source softwares, which are called M-type
   and D-type respectively [21].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   memo are to be interpreted as described in [4].

   In this section, we introduce the defintion of elliptic curve and
   bilinear map, notation used in this memo.

3.1.  Elliptic Curve

   Throughout this memo, let p > 3 be a prime and F_p be a finite field.
   The curve defined by the following equation E is called elliptic
   curve.

   E : y^2 = x^3 + A*x + B such that A, B are in F_p,
           4 * A^3 + 27 * B^2 != 0 mod p

   Solutions (x,y) for an elliptic curve E, as well as the point at
   infinity, are called F_p-rational points.  The additive group is
   constructed by a well-defined operation in the set of F_p-rational
   points.  Typically, the cyclic additive group with prime order q and
   base point G in E(F_p) is used for the cryptographic applications.
   Furthermore, we define terminology used in this memo as follows.

      O_E: the point at infinity over elliptic curve E.

      #E(F_p): number of points on an elliptic curve E over F_p.

      cofactor h: h = #E(F_p)/q.

      embedding degree k: minimum integer k such that r is a divisor of
      q^k - 1 and r^2 is not a divisor of q^k - 1

3.2.  Bilinear Map

   Let G_1 be an additive group of prime order p and let G_2 and G_T be
   additive and multiplicative groups, respectively, of the same order.
   Let P, Q be generators of G_1, G_2 respectively.  We say that (G_1,
   G_2, G_T) are asymmetric bilinear map groups if there exists a
   bilinear map e: (G_1, G_2) -> G_T satisfying the following
   properties:

   1.  Bilinearity: for any S in G_1, for any T in G_2, for any a, b in
       Z_q, we have the relation e(aS, bT) = e(S,T)^{ab}.

   2.  Non-degeneracy: for any S in G_1, e(S,T) = 1 for any T in G_2
       only if S = O_E.

   3.  Computability: for any S in G_1, for any T in G_2, the bilinear
       map is efficiently computable.

   4.  There exists an efficient, publicly computable isomorphism I: G_2
       -> G_1 such that I(Q) = P.

   For BN-curves, G_1 is a q-order cyclic subgroup of E(F_p) and G_2 is
   a subgroup of E(F_{p^k}), where k is the embedding degree of the

   curve.  The group G_T is the set of q-th roots of unity in the finite
   field F_{p^k}.

4.  Domain Parameter Specification

   In this section, this memo specifies the domain parameters for two
   254-bit elliptic curves which allow us to efficiently compute the
   operation of a pairing at high levels of security and domain
   parameters for 224, 256, 384, and 512-bit elliptic curves which are
   compliant with the ISO document [3].

4.1.  Notations for Domain Parameters and Types of Sextic Twists

   Here, we define notations for specifying domain parameters and
   explain types of pairing friendly curves.

   Domain parameters of the elliptic curve E(F_p) and E(F_{p^12}) are
   needed for computation of the pairing.  Barreto and Naehrig proposed
   a method of point and pairing compression by using output of a map I
   from a sextic twist E'(F_{p^2}) to E(F_{p^12}) instead of
   E(F_{p^12}).  Generally, this method is used with BN-curves.  Hence,
   this memo follows the method.  For the details of the method, refer
   to [5].

   The pairing friendly curves are classified two types, which are
   called D-type and M-type respectively [21].  The D-type sextic twist
   curve is defined by equation y'^2 = x'^3 + b/s when elliptic curve
   E(F_p) is let to be y^2 = x^3 + b and represent of F_{p^12} is let to
   be F_{p^2}[u]/(u^6 - s), where s is in F_{p^2}^*.  Let z be a root of
   u^6 - s, where z is in F_{p^12}. The corresponding map I: E'(F_{p^2})
   -> E(F_{p^12}) is (x', y') -> (z^2 * x', z^3 * y').

   The M-type sextic twist curve is defined by equation y'^2 = x'^3 + b
   * s when elliptic curve E(F_p) is let to be y^2 = x^3 + b and
   represent of F_{p^12} is let to be F_{p^2}[u]/(u^6 - s), where s is
   in F_{p^2}^*.  The corresponding map I: E'(F_{p^2}) -> E(F_{p^12}) is
   (x', y') -> (x' * s^{-1} * z^4, y' * s^{-1} * z^3), with z^6 = s.

   These domain parameters are described in the following way.

      Curve-ID is an identifier with which the curve can be referenced.

      p_b is a prime specifying base field.

      p_e is an irreducible polynomial specifying extension field.

   For elliptic curve E

      A and B are the coefficients of the equation y^2 = x^3 + A * x + B
      mod p defining E.

      G = (x,y) is the base point, i.e., a point with x and y being its
      x- and y-coordinates in E, respectively.

      q is the prime order of the group generated by G.

      h is the cofactor of G in E

   For twist curve E'

      A' and B' are the coefficients of the equation y^2 = x^3 + A' * x
      + B' mod p defining E'.

      G' = (x',y') is the base point, i.e., a point with x' and y' being
      its x'- and y'-coordinates in E', respectively.

      q' is the prime order of the group generated by G'.

      h' is the cofactor of G' in E'

4.2.  Efficient Domain Parameters for 254-Bit-Curves

   In this section, this memo specifies the domain parameters for two
   254-bit elliptic curves which are more efficient than parameters of
   ISO document with D-type.

   x'^3 + 5/s = x'^3 - u, where F_{p^2} = F_{p}[u]/(u^2 + 5), F_{p^6} =
   F_{p^2}[v]/(v^3 - u), F_{p^12} = F_{p^6}[w]/(w^2 - v), s = - 5/u. We
   describe domain parameters of elliptic curves E and E'.  For the
   details of these parameters, refer to [1].

4.2.2.  Domain Parameters by Aranha et al.

   Here, we describe the domain parameters for 254-bit elliptic curve
   [2] with D-type.

   The domain parameters described in this subsection are defined by
   elliptic curve E(F_p) : y^2 = x^3 + 2 and sextic twist E'(F_{p^2}) :
   x'^3 + 2/s = x'^3 + 1 - u, where ,F_{p^2} = F_p [u]/(u^2 + 1),
   F_{p^6} = F_{p^2} [v]/(v^3 - (1+u)), F_{p^12} = F_{p^6} [w]/(w^2 -
   v), 1/s = 1/(1 + u).  We describes domain parameters of elliptic
   curves E and E'.  For the details of these parameters, refer to [2].

4.3.  Domain Parameters Based on ISO Document

   Here, we describe the domain parameters for 224, 256, 384, and
   512-bit elliptic curves which are compliant with the ISO document and
   are based on M-type.  The domain parameters described in below
   subsections are defined by Elliptic curve E(F_p): y^2 = x^3 + 3 and
   sextic twist E'(F_{p^2}): y'^2 = x'^3 + 3 * s, where F_{p^2} = F_p[X]
   /(X^2 + 1), F_{p^12} = F_{p^2}[X]/(X^6 - s), s = 1 + X. We describe
   domain parameters of elliptic curves E.  Detailed information on
   these domain parameters is given in [3].

4.3.5.  Differences between D-Type and M-Type on ISO parameters

   Although ISO document is based on M-type, open source softwares are
   often based on D-type.  We need to be aware of the differences.
   Hence we also describe elliptic curve with D-type based on ISO
   document.  The elliptic curve E(F_p) is defined by equation y^2 = x^3

   + 3 and the sextic twist E'(F_{p^2}) is defined by y'^2 = x'^3 + 3/s,
   where F_{p^2} = F_p[X]/(X^2 + 1), F_{p^12} = F_{p^2}[X]/(X^6 - s), 1/
   s = -8 + 8 * i, i = X^2 + 1.  Detailed information on these domain
   parameters is given in [5].

5.  Object Identifiers

   We need to define the following object identifiers.  Which
   organization is suitable for the allotment of these object
   identifiers?

      Fp254BNa OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {TBD}

      Fp254n2BNa OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {TBD}

      Fp254BNb OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {TBD}

      Fp254n2BNb OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {TBD}

      Fp224BN OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {TBD}

      Fp256BN OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {TBD}

      Fp384BN OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {TBD}

      Fp512BN OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {TBD}

6.  Security Considerations

   Elliptic curves which are specified in this memo have hardness of the
   problems below and enough security margin against the attacks below.

   The elliptic curve that supports a bilinear map requires the hardness
   of solving following problems, since the security of pairing-based
   cryptographic primitives is based on hardness of these problems.
   (For details of problems, refer to section 2 of [14].)

      The elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP)

      The elliptic curve computational Diffie-Hellman problem (ECDHP)

      The bilinear Diffie-Hellman problem (BDHP)

      The elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem with auxiliary
      inputs (ECDLP with auxiliary inputs)

   Algorithms to efficiently solve the problems above, aside from
   special cases, are unknown.  When choosing elliptic curve domain

   parameters we need to consider the Pollard-rho algorithm [16] and
   Menezes-Okamoto-Vanstone algorithm [15] as generic attacks against
   ECDLP.  The Pollard-rho algorithm is believed to have the best
   performance against ECDLP at present.  However, it is an exponential
   time algorithm.  Menezes-Okamoto-Vanstone algorithm converts ECDLP
   into the discrete logarithm problem in a finite field F_{p^k}^*, the
   codomain of the bilinear map, where k is embedding number.  This is a
   subexponential time algorithm.

   The Smart, Semaev, and Sato-Araki algorithm [17], and Cheon algorithm
   [14] are main algorithms which improve efficiency in specific cases.
   The Smart-Semaev algorithm and Sato-Araki algorithm are polynotmial
   time algorithms against the ECDLP in the case where #E(F_{p}) equals
   to p.  These algorithms are independently proposed.  Cheon algorithm
   [14] is against the ECDLP with auxiliary inputs.  It is prevented by
   satisfy the following condition, where n is order.

      there is no divisor d of n - 1 s.t. (log n)^2 < d < n^{1/2} and
      there is no divisor e of n + 1 s.t. (log n)^2 < e < n^{1/2}

   Table 1 shows the security level of elliptic curves described in this
   memo ([1], [2]).  Schemes based on the elliptic curves must be
   combined with cryptographic primitives which have similar or greater
   security level than the scheme.

           |  Curve-ID  | Security Level (bits) |
           --------------------------------------
           |  Fp224BN   |          112          |
           |  Fp254BNa  |          128          |
           |  Fp254BNb  |          128          |
           |  Fp256BN   |          128          |
           |  Fp384BN   |          128          |
           |  Fp512BN   |          128          |
