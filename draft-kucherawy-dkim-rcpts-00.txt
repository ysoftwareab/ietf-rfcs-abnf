                Including Recipients in DKIM Signatures
                     draft-kucherawy-dkim-rcpts-00

Abstract

   The DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) protocol applies a domain-level
   cryptographic signature to an e-mail message.  DKIM only guarantees
   authenticity of the message content and does not consider the message
   envelope.  This allows for replay attacks by recycling a signed
   message with an arbitrary new set of recipients.

   This document presents a protocol extension that can include the
   original set of envelope recipients in the signed content, so that an
   altered set of recipients renders the signature invalid.

1.  Introduction

   DKIM [RFC6376] defines a cryptographic signature, placed in a header
   field consisting of a series of tags and values.  The values include
   signed hashes of some of the header fields and part or all of the
   body of a message.  The signature contains a domain name that is
   responsible for the signature and thus takes some responsibility for
   the presence of the message in the email stream.

   The signature is valid if the hashes in the signature match the
   corresponding hashes of the message at validation time, the signature
   is validated by a public key retrieved from that responsible domain's
   DNS, and it is before the expiration time in the signature header
   field (if set).

   There have been recent incidents of a replay attack, where a message
   of undesirable content (spam, malware, phishing, etc.) is sent by a
   bad actor to itself through an email service, which dutifully signs
   it.  This message now bears the digital signature of the signing
   agent's domain, which means in many cases that the signing agent's
   reputation will be weighed by a receiver when assessing the likely
   safety of the message.  The bad actor is then free to re-send that
   message to any number of other recipients with that same signature,
   any number of times, by altering the set of recipients on the message

   (the "envelope" in terms of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
   [RFC5321]) and re-sending it.  This was anticipated by [RFC6376]
   Section 8.6.

   Obviously a signing agent would be well within its rights and own
   interests to decline to sign something that looks like it might be
   unwanted content, but such measures are not fool-proof.  What is
   needed, then, is a way to thwart these sorts of replay attacks.

   The proposal presented here is to include in the content presented
   for signing the original recipient set of the message.  A verifier
   would thereby expect that the original recipient set coupled with the
   regular signed content in a DKIM signature would be needed to verify
   the signature, and any change to either the message or the recipient
   set would result in the signature being invalidated.

2.  Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Syntax descriptions use Augmented BNF (ABNF) [RFC5234].  The
   definition of the "FWS" ABNF token is taken from [RFC6376]
   Section 2.8.

   A full description of the email ecosystem can be found in [RFC5598].

3.  'nr' Tag Definition

   The following DKIM tag (see [RFC6376] Section 3.5) is introduced:

   nr=  Number of canonicalized recipients (plain-text unsigned decimal
      integer; OPTIONAL).

     ABNF:

     sig-nr-tag = %x6e.72 [FWS] "=" [FWS] 1*DIGIT

      If present, this indicates that the canonicalized form of the
      header produced according to (see [RFC6376] Section 3.4) is
      prefixed with this number of SMTP [RFC5321] recipents.

4.  Implementation

   This section describes implementation of this extension in detail.

4.1.  Signers

   When producing the canonicalized header using this tag, the signer
   takes the following steps:

   1.  Collect the SMTP recipients that are to be used for sending the
       message being signed.

   2.  Sort these using a typical string sort operation.

   3.  Append a carriage return and line feed to each (ASCII 0x0D and
       0x0A respectively).

   4.  Prepend this construction to the canonicalized header before
       hashing.

   5.  Include in the DKIM-Signature header field an "nr" tag as
       described in Section 3 indicating the number of recipients in the
       list above.

   6.  Continue with header canonicalization and hashing as defined in
       [RFC6376].

4.2.  Verifiers

   When analyzing the DKIM-Signature field on an arriving message that
   includs the tag defined in Section 3, the verifier takes the
   following steps:

   1.  Collect the SMTP recipients that were present in the transaction
       that delivered the message under evaluation.

   2.  If the size of this list does not match the value of the "nr" tag
       defined in Section 3, the DKIM signature is invalid; stop and
       report PERMFAIL ([RFC6376] Section 3.9).

   3.  Sort these using a typical string sort operation.

   4.  Append a carriage return and line feed to each (ASCII 0x0D and
       0x0A respectively).

   5.  Prepend this construction to the canonicalized header before
       hashing.

   6.  Continue with header canonicalization and hashing and signature
       verification as defined in [RFC6376].

   This has the effect of requiring the same recipient set on the
   message at time of receipt (more precisely, at time of verification)
   as was there at the time of signing of the message.  If that is not
   the case, different content will be produced for the canonicalized
   header, ultimately leading to an invalidated signature.  This
   effectively prevents the sort of attack described in Section 1.

5.  Compatibility with Current Infrastructure

   [RFC6376] Section 3.5 requires verifiers to ignore tags they do not
   understand.  Accordingly, the introduction of this tag by signers
   should have no negative impact on existing implementations except
   that any signatures using them are guaranteed to be considered
   invalid by verifiers that don't implement this extension, since the
   signer and verifier will disagree on what the canonicalized header
   ought to contain.

   Further, [RFC6376] Section 6.1 advises against taking any sort of
   punitive action against a message with an invalid signature, so
   again, no negative impact is anticipated.

   This will impact the validity of DKIM signatures transiting any
   service that legitimately alters the envelope recipient set.
   Examples of this are email forwarding services and mailing lists, or
   any Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) that needs to send a message to
   different recipients via different connections such as when they
   exist in different Administrative Management Domains (ADMDs).

   Some DKIM verifiers are implemented as modules downstream of the SMTP
   receiver.  As such, they may not get the complete list of recipients
   that was presented by the sender if, for example, the SMTP receiver
   rejected one or more of those recipients due to invalidity or a limit
   on the number of acceptable recipients per message or per session.
   They may also get a rewritten (e.g., canonicalized) form of certain
   recipients.  This would lead to invalidation of signatures generated
   via the extension presented here.

   Taken together, the issues raised above suggest that the optimal use
   case for this extension would be messages that have only a single
   recipient at the time of signing.  However, the details of the
   proposal do not actually proscribe other use cases.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register the following in the "DKIM-Signature
   Tag Specifications" registry:

   Type:  nr

7.  Privacy Considerations

   The list of recipients of a message is not typically recorded
   anywhere in the message content itself and is instead a property of
   the SMTP "envelope" used to transport it that is discarded on
   delivery.  This results in the ability to, among other things, do a
   "blind carbon copy" of a message that does not reveal one recipient
   to the others.

   This proposal adds the full recipient set to the content presented
   for hashing and ultimate transmission of the message.  It does not
   expose that content to receivers, so there is not a direct leak of
   potentially private information.

   However, this proposal obviously leaks the number of recipients the
   verifier included in the hashed header content.  This by itself might
   be of interest to an attacker.

   Moreover, if a signed message using this tag is received by an
   attacker with some idea of what recipients might have been on the
   envelope, such an attacker could simply attempt to repeat signature
   verification using the suspected set of recipients as described in
   Section 4.2 and, if successful, thereby recover the original
   recipient set.

8.  Security Considerations

   Section 8 of [RFC6376] enumerates known security issues with DKIM.
   In particular, Section 8.6 of [RFC6376] anticipated this attack.

   The issues of compatibility discussed in [RFC6376] are unfortunately
   the ideal.  It is possible or even likely that introducing a new DKIM
   tag that requires verifier participation for success will result in
   rejection of otherwise legitimate messages, the impact of which
   depends almost entirely on the sensitivity of the content thus
   rejected.

   Apart from the privacy-specific discussion in Section 7, and the
   potential impact on current infrastructure discussed in Section 5, no
   new security issues are introduced here.

9.  Implementation Status

   The next release of OpenDKIM will implement this proposal.  OpenDKIM
   is in widespread use, including at very large installations, so use
   and utility of this extension can be easily observed.
