Abstract

   This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module
   which contains Textual Conventions to represent commonly used
   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) management
   information. The intent is that these TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS (TCs) will
   be imported and used in GMPLS related MIB modules that would
   otherwise define their own representations.

1. Introduction

   This document defines a MIB module which contains Textual Conventions
   for Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) networks.
   These Textual Conventions should be imported by MIB modules which
   manage GMPLS networks.

   This MIB module supplements the MIB module in [TCMIB] that defines
   Textual Conventions for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
   Management. [TCMIB] may continue to be used without this MIB module
   in networks that support only MPLS.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Comments should be made directly to the CCAMP mailing list at
   ccamp@ops.ietf.org.

   For an introduction to the concepts of GMPLS, see [GMPLSArch].


2. The SNMP Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

   gmplsStdMIB OBJECT IDENTIFIER
     -- This object identifier needs to be assigned by IANA.
     -- Since mpls has been assigned an ifType of 166 we recommend
     -- that this OID be 166 as well, i.e.
   ::= { transmission XXX }

   GmplsFreeformLabel ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION

     DESCRIPTION
       "This value represents a freeform generalized MPLS Label. This
        can be used to represent label types which are not standard
        in the drafts. It may also be used by systems that do not
        wish to represent the labels using the specific label types."
     SYNTAX OCTET STRING (SIZE (0..64))

   GmplsGeneralizedLabelTypes ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION

     STATUS      current
     DESCRIPTION
       "The direction of data flow on an LSP segment with respect to the
        head of the LSP.

        Where an LSP is signaled using a conventional signaling
        protocol, the 'head' of the LSP is the source of the signaling
        (also known as the ingress) and the 'tail' is the destination
        (also known as the egress).

        For manually configured LSPs an arbitrary decision must be made
        about which LER is the 'head'."

       forward(1),

4. Security Considerations

   This module does not define any management objects. Instead, it
   defines a set of textual conventions which may be used by other GMPLS
   MIB modules to define management objects.

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB
   modules that define management objects. Therefore, this document has
   no impact on the security of the Internet.


5. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to make a MIB OID assignment under the transmission
   branch, that is, assign the gmplsStdMIB under { transmission 166 }.

   This sub-id is requested because 166 is the ifType for mpls(166) and
   is available under transmission.

   In the future, GMPLS related standards track MIB modules should be
   rooted under the mplsStdMIB (sic) subtree. IANA is requested to
   manage that namespace. New assignments can only be made via a
   Standards Action as specified in [RFC2434].

   This document also requests IANA to assign { gmplsStdMIB xx } to the
   GMPLS-TC-STD-MIB specified in this document.
