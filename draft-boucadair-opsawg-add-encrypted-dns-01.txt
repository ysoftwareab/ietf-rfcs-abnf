1.  Introduction

   In the context of broadband services, ISPs traditionally provide DNS
   resolvers to their customers.  To that aim, ISPs deploy dedicated
   mechanisms to advertise a list of DNS Recursive DNS server(s) to
   their customers (e.g., DHCP, IPv6 Router Advertisement).  The
   information used to populate DHCP messages and/or IPv6 Router
   Advertisements relies upon specific Remote Authentication Dial-In
   User Service (RADIUS) [RFC2865] attributes such as the DNS-Server-
   IPv6-Address Attribute specified in [RFC6911].

   With the advent of Encrypted DNS (e.g., DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)
   [RFC8484], DNS-over-TLS (DoT) [RFC7858], or DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ)
   [I-D.ietf-dprive-dnsoquic]), additional means are required to
   provision hosts with network-designated Encrypted DNS.  To fill that
   void, [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] leverages existing protocols such as DHCP
   and IPv6 Router Advertisement to provide hosts with the required
   information to connect to an Encrypted DNS server.  However, there
   are no RADIUS attributes that can be used to populate the discovery
   messages discussed in [I-D.ietf-add-dnr].

   This document specifies two new RADIUS attributes: IPv6-Encrypted-DNS
   (Section 3.1) and IPv4-Encrypted-DNS (Section 3.2) Attributes.  Note
   that two attributes are specified in order to accommodate both IPv4

   and IPv6 deployment contexts while taking into account the
   constraints in Section 3.4 of [RFC6158].

   Typical deployment scenarios are similar to those described, for
   instance, in Section 2 of [RFC6911].  Some of these deployments may
   rely upon the mechanisms defined in [RFC4014] or [RFC7037], which
   allows a Network Access Server (NAS) to pass attributes obtained from
   a RADIUS server to a DHCP server.  For illustration purposes,
   Figure 1 shows an example where a Customer Premises Equipment (CPE)
   is provided with an Encrypted DNS server.  This example assumes that
   the NAS embeds both RADIUS client and DHCPv6 server capabilities.

              Figure 1: Example of RADIUS IPv6 Encrypted DNS

   Upon receipt of the DHCPv6 Solicit message from a CPE, the NAS sends
   a RADIUS Access-Request message to the AAA server.  Once the AAA
   server receives the request, it replies with an Access-Accept message
   (possibly after having sent a RADIUS Access-Challenge message and
   assuming the CPE is entitled to connect to the network) that carries
   a list of parameters to be used for this session, and which include
   the Encrypted DNS information.  The content of the IPv6-Encrypted-DNS
   Attribute is then used by the NAS to complete the DHCPv6 procedure
   that the CPE initiated to retrieve information about the encrypted
   DNS service to use.  The procedure defined in [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] is
   thus followed between the DHCPv6 client and the DHCPv6 server.  The
   same procedure is followed between the DHCPv6 client on endpoints
   serviced by the CPE and the DHCPv6 server on CPE.

Internet-Draft          RADIUS for Encrypted DNS               June 2021


   Upon change of the any Encrypted DNS-related information (e.g., ADN,
   IPv6 address), the RADIUS server sends a RADIUS CoA message [RFC5176]
   that carries the RADIUS IPv6-Encrypted-DNS Attributed to the NAS.
   Once that message is accepted by the NAS, it replies with a RADIUS
   CoA ACK message.  The NAS replaces the old Encrypted DNS server
   information with the new one and sends a DHCPv6 Reconfigure message
   to cause the DHCPv6 client to initiate a Renew/Reply message exchange
   with the DHCPv6 server.

   Figure 2 shows another example where a CPE is provided an Encrypted
   DNS server, but the CPE uses DHCPv4 to retrieve its encrypted DNS
   server.

   capitals, as shown here.

   This document makes use of the terms defined in [RFC8499].  The
   following additional terms are used:

   Encrypted DNS:  refers to a scheme where DNS exchanges are
      transported over an encrypted channel.  Examples of encrypted DNS
      are DNS-over-TLS (DoT) [RFC7858], DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) [RFC8484],
      or DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ) [I-D.ietf-dprive-dnsoquic].

   *-Encrypted-DNS  refers to IPv6-Encrypted-DNS and IPv4-Encrypted-DNS
      Attributes.

   Encrypted-DNS-*  refers to any of these attributes: Encrypted-DNS-
      ADN, Encrypted-DNS-IPv6-Address, Encrypted-DNS-IPv4-Address, and
      Encrypted-DNS-SvcParams.

3.  Encrypted DNS RADIUS Attributes

   Both IPv6-Encrypted-DNS and IPv4-Encrypted-DNS have the same format
   shown in Figure 3.  The description of the fields is provided in
   Sections 3.1 and 3.2.

   These attributes and their embedded TLVs (Section 3.3) are defined
   with globally unique names and follow the guidelines in Section 2.7.1
   of [RFC6929].

   The IPv6-Encrypted-DNS Attribute includes the authentication domain
   name, a list of IPv6 addresses, and a set of service parameters of an
   encrypted DNS resolver [I-D.ietf-add-dnr].

   Because multiple IPv6-Encrypted-DNS Attributes may be provisioned to
   a requesting host, multiple instances of the IPv6-Encrypted-DNS
   attribute MAY be included; each instance of the attribute carries a
   distinct Encrypted DNS server.

   The IPv6-Encrypted-DNS Attribute MAY appear in a RADIUS Access-Accept
   packet.  It MAY also appear in a RADIUS Access-Request packet as a
   hint to the RADIUS server to indicate a preference.  However, the
   server is not required to honor such a preference.

   The IPv6-Encrypted-DNS Attribute MAY appear in a RADIUS CoA-Request
   packet.

   The IPv6-Encrypted-DNS Attribute MAY appear in a RADIUS Accounting-
   Request packet.

   The IPv6-Encrypted-DNS Attribute MUST NOT appear in any other RADIUS
   packet.

   The IPv6-Encrypted-DNS Attribute is structured as follows:

   Type

      241

   Length

      This field indicates the total length, in octets, of all fields of
      this attribute, including the Type, Length, Extended-Type, and the
      entire length of the embedded TLVs.

   Extended-Type

   Value

      This field contains a set of TLVs as follows:

      Encrypted-DNS-ADN TLV:  The IPv6-Encrypted-DNS Attribute MUST
         include exactly one instance of Encrypted-DNS-ADN TLV
         (Section 3.3.1).

         (Section 3.3.4).

   The IPv6-Encrypted-DNS Attribute is associated with the following
   identifier: 241.TBA1.

3.2.  IPv4-Encrypted-DNS Attribute

   This attribute is of type "tlv" as defined in Section 2.3 of
   [RFC6929].

   The IPv4-Encrypted-DNS Attribute includes the authentication domain
   name, a list of IPv4 addresses, and a set of service parameters of an
   encrypted DNS resolver [I-D.ietf-add-dnr].

   Because multiple IPv4-Encrypted-DNS attributes may be provisioned to
   a requesting host, multiple instances of the IPv4-Encrypted-DNS
   attribute MAY be included; each instance of the attribute carries a
   distinct Encrypted DNS server.

   The IPv4-Encrypted-DNS Attribute MAY appear in a RADIUS Access-Accept
   packet.  It MAY also appear in a RADIUS Access-Request packet as a
   hint to the RADIUS server to indicate a preference.  However, the
   server is not required to honor such a preference.

   The IPv4-Encrypted-DNS Attribute MAY appear in a RADIUS CoA-Request
   packet.

   The IPv4-Encrypted-DNS Attribute MAY appear in a RADIUS Accounting-
   Request packet.

   The IPv4-Encrypted-DNS Attribute MUST NOT appear in any other RADIUS
   packet.

   The IPv4-Encrypted-DNS Attribute is structured as follows:

   Data Type

      The Encrypted-DNS-IPv4-Address TLV is of type ip4addr (Section 3.8
      of [RFC8044]).

   TLV-Value

      This field includes an IPv4 address (32 bits) of the Encrypted DNS
      server.

      The Encrypted-DNS-IPv4-Address attribute MUST NOT include
      multicast and host loopback addresses.

   This TLV is identified as 241.TBA1.TBA5 as part of the IPv4-
   Encrypted-DNS Attribute (Section 3.2).

3.3.4.  Encrypted-DNS-SvcParams TLV

   TLV-Type

      TBA6 (see Section 6.2).

   TLV-Length

      Length of included service parameters + 2 octets.

   Data Type

      The Encrypted-DNS-SvcParams TLV is of type text (Section 3.4 of
      [RFC8044]).

   TLV-Value

      Specifies a set of service parameters that are encoded following
      the rules in [I-D.ietf-add-dnr].  Service parameters may include,
      for example, a list of ALPN protocol identifiers or alternate port
      numbers.

      The service parameters MUST NOT include "ipv4hint" or "ipv6hint"
      SvcParams as they are superseded by the included IP addresses.

   This TLV is identified as 241.TBA1.TBA6 when included in the IPv6-
   Encrypted-DNS Attribute (Section 3.1) and as 241.TBA2.TBA6 when
   included in the IPv4-Encrypted-DNS Attribute (Section 3.2).

4.  Security Considerations

   RADIUS-related security considerations are discussed in [RFC2865].

   Security considerations (including traffic theft) are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-add-dnr].

5.  Table of Attributes

   The following table provides a guide as what type of RADIUS packets
   that may contain these attributes, and in what quantity.

   Access- Access- Access-  Challenge Acct. # Attribute
   Request Accept  Reject             Request
    0+      0+      0        0         0+      TBA1 IPv6-Encrypted-DNS
    0+      0+      0        0         0+      TBA2 IPv4-Encrypted-DNS

   CoA-Request CoA-ACK CoA-NACK #   Attribute
     0+          0       0      TBA1 IPv6-Encrypted-DNS
     0+          0       0      TBA1 IPv4-Encrypted-DNS

   The following table defines the meaning of the above table entries:

   0  This attribute MUST NOT be present in packet.
   0+ Zero or more instances of this attribute MAY be present in packet.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  New RADIUS Attributes

   IANA is requested to assign two new RADIUS attribute types from the
   IANA registry "Radius Attribute Types" located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/radius-types:

      IPv6-Encrypted-DNS (241.TBA1)

      IPv4-Encrypted-DNS (241.TBA2)

      Type      Description          Data Type   Reference
      --------  ------------------   ---------   -------------

      241.TBA2  IPv4-Encrypted-DNS   tlv         This-Document

6.2.  New RADIUS TLVs

   IANA is requested to create a new registry called "RADIUS Encrypted
   DNS TLVs".  The registry is initially populated as follows:

Appendix A.  Other Usages of the Attributes

   For the particular case of DoH [RFC8484], the attributes defined in
   Section 3 can also be used for redirection purposes.  For example, a
   DoH server may redirect DoH clients to other DoH servers (e.g., local
   forwarders hosted by a CPE).  To that aim, when a DoH query is
   received from a DoH client, the DoH servers interacts with an AAA
   server to check whether redirection should be enabled for this
   client.  If such redirection is to be enabled, the AAA server returns
   IPv4-Encrypted-DNS and/or IPv6-Encrypted-DNS Attributes that will be
   used to populate the DoH redirection response that will then be sent
   to the DoH client.  The DoH client may contact the DoH server using
   the information supplied in the redirection response.
