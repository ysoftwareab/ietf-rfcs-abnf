Internet-Draft      Local Authentication Scheme               July 2006


   IP available in commercial world is secure access with it.
   In this draft, we propose a novel scheme to locally authenticate
   and authorize inter-domain roaming users for efficient way in IEEE
   802.16e BWA based on authentication, authorization and 
   accout-ing(AAA) infrastructure. We present the detailed operations
   to establish local security association(SA) for authentication and
   performance evaluation by con-sidering the traffic and mobility 
   properties of a roaming user as well as the dis-tance between the 
   mobile node(MN) and its home AAA server. Proposed scheme outperforms
   exiting method with respect to authentication cost and ser-vice
   latency.

1. Introduction

   Mobile IP enables a MN to move freely from one point of connection
   to Internet to another point without disruption of pre-established
   end-to-end transport connection, e.g. TCP. When a MN enters a visited
   domain, it obtains a temporary IP address named Care-of Address(CoA)
   and registers it with home agent(HA), a special router in its home
   domain. The correspondent node (CN) communicating with the MN can
   send packets to the MNs home address. The MNs home domain captures
   the packets sent to ti and forwards them to its temporary address[1].
   The one of the main problem is from lacking of security service. 
   The MN should be authenticated to verify the right of its 
   ccessibility if it is regal user by pre-defined contractions
   between ISPs[2].
   
   IEEE 802.16 wireless MN called ¡®Worldwide Interoperability for
   Microware Ac-cess(WiMAX)¡¯ has been standardized as a promising
   solution of a fixed broadband wireless access system and it
   provides network access from building through external antennas
   communicating with central base stations[3,4]. Due to its feature
   covering broad areas without expensive installation cost, it may
   offer ubiquitous broadband access[3]. Additionally, IEEE 802.16e
   called ¡®Wireless Broadband(WiBro)¡¯ is a stan-dard in progressing
   for BWA in order to support mobility with offering up to 2Mbps at
   60km/h, which is expected to fill the gap between fixed wired or
   wireless networks and mobility systems.
   
   [5] describes the various deployment scenarios to provide migration
   path toward 4G. WiFi is already in laptop, cell phones and PDAs.
   One of the first uses of 802.16 will be backhaul for WiFi hotspots
   forming a micro cell. With WiMAX, hotspots will be extended as so 
   called ¡®hotzone¡¯ for user of WiFi applications. Next, the WiMAX 
   main base station(BS) with wired backhaul at the center of cluster
   of WiMAX mesh base stations forms a macro cell providing coverage
   for the surrounding region. Fi-nally, deployment of mobile 
   WiMAX(WiBro) is suggested to get the complete 4G with full mobility.
   To offer mobility, the wireless service must be as pervasive as cell
   phone service. The solution is to create small cells instead of 
   trying to cover large areas with a single antenna.
   
   The main challenges reported from IETF mobile ip WG are security and
   quality of service(QoS)[6]. Both are important in providing reliable
   communications because of the unprotected and bursty open medium.
   To provide security services in wireless networks, authentication
   to identify the MN and negotiate credentials such as encryp-tion
   keys and algorithms for secure communication [7,8,9].

   The security research has taken into 802.16e and Mobile IP with
   different aspect of approach without the rela-tionship between them.
   As a complementary protocol leveraging the 802.16e and Mobile IP,
   FIMP becomes a candidate to start and complete the layer3 handover
   and binding update by using results of its successful deployment 
   scenarios. 
   
  In this draft, we propose service architecture to support fast and
  secure global roaming service across multiple service domains.
  Using this scheme, a mobile user can be served with continuous
  communication service when it is belonging to different domain.
  Mobile user only needs to carry single identification to receive
  the same ser-vice on any service network that minimizes the handoff
  latency in AAA-enabled roam-ing service specifically to support
  real-time applications.
  
  This draft is organized as follows. In Section 2, we summarize the
  operations of AAA-enabled mobile IP architecture and discuss the
  performance issue raised in the support of fast handoff in secure
  global roaming service. In Section 3, we present the AAA-enabled
  roaming service integrated with fast handoff scheme over IEEE 802.16e
  BWA. The proposed model is aligned with IETF Mobile IP [1,10,11] and
  AAA frameworks. In Section 4, we describe the goals and design of
  authentication scheme for the case of mobility patterns, e.g. traffic
  and movement probability in which the optimized operations are
  introduced with considering the security issues [2]. In Sec-tion
  5 and 6, performance enhancement scheme and cost evaluation of our
  proposal are described in respect to existing schemes, mobile ip and
  fast handover in IEEE 802.16e. Finally, the conclusion is given in 
  Section 7.

2. Terminology

   This document borrows all of the terminology from Mobile IPv6 [1] and
   AAA for Mobile MIPv6 [3].
      Attendant: AAA entity which is the local AAA system entry point
                 and the local address provider/registry. Term from [8].

      AAA client: attendant.

      AAA home server (AAAH): AAA server of the home network.
 
      AAA local server (AAAL): AAA server of the local network.

      AVP (Attribute Value Pair): AAA (element of) payload.

      Binding: home address/care-of address association for a mobile
                   node on a mobility aware IPv6 node.

      Care-of address (Co@): temporary address used by a mobile node.
               The care-of address is allocated or registered by a local
               entity which is assumed for simplicity in this document
               to be the same than the attendant.

      Home address (H@): fixed address used by a mobile node.
               The home address belongs to the home network and is in
               general well known by the mobile node even if the
               protocol described here supports home address allocation.

      Home agent (HA): router on the home network which forwards
               traffic at the destination of the home address to the
               mobile node.

      Mobile Node (MN): node using mobile IPv6 mechanisms.

      Correspondent Node (CN)
               A IPv6 host communicating with MN.

      Network Access Identifier (NAI): [5] mobile user identifier
               which is compatible with user_FQDN identities of IKE.
               We assume NAI can be used to identify any entity involved
               here even if some of them are nodes and not users.
   
      Security Association (SA): a security connection which affords
               security services to some traffic between peers.
               This notion is shared between IPsec, ISAKMP and AAA
               over different forms.

      Access Router (AR)
               The MN's default router.

      Handover
               A process of terminating existing connectivity and
               obtaining new IP connectivity.

      Router Solicitation for Proxy Advertisement (RtSolPr)
               A message from the MN to the PAR requesting information
               for a potential handover.

      Proxy Router Advertisement (PrRtAdv)
               A message from the PAR to the MN that provides
               information about neighboring links facilitating
               expedited movement detection.  The message also acts as a
               trigger for network-initiated handover.


3. Authentication Overview on AAA Infrastructure


   In order to deliver the authentication messages between networks,
   many authentica-tion architectures are proposed for different
   types of mobile networks. This draft adopts the Diameter-based
   AAA architecture which is proposed by IETF for Mobile IP networks. 
   AAA infrastructure is composed of local AAA servers(AAAv), home AAA
   serv-ers(AAAh), and proxy AAA servers(AAAp). An AAAv is an AAA server
   that serves for the visiting MNs in a network domain for AAA 
   operations. An AAAh is an AAA server in the home network of MN.
   AAAp relays the AAA messages between differ-ent AAA servers with 
   secure manner. Figure 1 shows the hierarchical deployment 
   architecture to provide a MN with secure authentication.
   
   Taking into account that, IRTF defined a framework providing a 
   suitable support for these concepts known as AAA. Note that current
   service providers have noticed about the importance of AAA 
   infrastructures to control their resources. In fact, the vast 
   majority of them have deployed these infrastructures for years
   successfully. How-ever, these infrastructures are based on protocols
   as RADIUS and TACACS+ that are considered as antiquated as they were 
   designed to support a specific kind of user and access technology,
   e.g. dialup PPP user with fixed connection.

   Diameter is a lightweight, peer-based AAA protocol designed to offer
   a scalable foundation for introducing a new policy and AAA service
   over existing(PPP) and emerging(roaming, Mobile IP) network
   technologies. Diameter employs many of the same mechanism as RADIUS,
   including UDP transport, encoded attribute and value pairs(AVP) and
   proxy server support. Also it attempts to correct limitations
   inherent in RADIUS. Diameter supports a much larger AVP length and 
   incorporates a reliable, window-based transport. It realizes the full
   authentication with less transaction of messages which is important
   in roaming environment.[12]
   
   To consider the efficiency and security with different mobility and 
   traffic patterns, we propose a local authentication scheme with SA
   delegation, which can be imple-mented based on AAA (Diameter)
   architecture.

4. IEEE 802.16e Handover

   Basically, the 3 steps are performed in completing Fast Handover
   procedure, Background Activity,Handover Preparation and Handover
   Execution. Serving BS(Base-station) advertises its presence to
   MN in the first step where the MN scans the Serving BS by
   referencing the information advertised from it. In the next step,
   the handover preparation is initiated by MN or Serving BS as shown
   in the figure x. After completing the steps, MN is reconnected to
   Target BS and joins the 802.16e Network. After switching the link,
   the MN synchronizes with the target BS and performs the 802.16e 
   network entry procedure.  The MN may exchange the RNG-REQ/RSP, 
   SBC-REQ/RSP, PKM-REQ/RSP, REG-REQ/RSP messages with the target BS.
   However, the messages exchanged between MN and Serving BS  should 
   be authen-ticated prior to execute the handover steps since the BST
   attacks can be installed be-tween them where an attacker mimics the
   MN to Serving BS and vice versa. As ap-proved in Mobile IP, Diameter
   protocol is appropriate for securing the messages.
   
   Handover procedures over 802.16e are defined for both predictive mode
   and reac-tive mode.  Note that there is no need of IP mobility when
   the target BS is under same subnet. Therefore FBU is sent
   conditionally depending on whether the target BS is under different
   subnet or not[4,7].


4.1.  IEEE 802.16e Fast Handover in Predictive Mode

   In this mode, Serving BS(PAR) advertises MOB_NBR_ADV message 
   periodically to announce its presence to the nodes in its 
   coverage. If the MN discovers the new neighbor BSs specified 
   in this message, it performs scanning for them. Then the MN tries
   to resolve the new neighbor¡¯s BSID to the associated AR by exchange
   the RtSolPr and PrRtAdv messages with the PAR. In this time, the MN
   initiates handover by sending MOB_MSHO_REQ to the Serving BS and 
   receives MOB_BSHO_RSP as the response from the PAR. Also, the Serving
   BS can initiate handover by sending MOB_BSHO_REQ to the MN. Upon 
   receiving the MOB_BSHO_RSP or MOB_BSHO_REQ from the Serving BS, 
   layer2 notifies upper layer of the time the link goes down by 
   predefined trigger. This triggering initiates the layer3 fast 
   handover procedure where the MN exchanges FBU and FBack with the PAR.
   The PAR estab-lishes the tunnel with NAR by exchanging HI/Hack

   messages[4] before sending FBack to the MN. During this procedure, 
   NAR verifies if NCoA is available or not. If FBack arrives before the 
   handover, MN sends MOB_HO_IND to complete the hand-over procedure as 
   defined in predictive mode. MN smoothly performs handover to the 
   target BS.

   When the network entry is finished, the MN triggers the status to
   layer2 to enable the link and issues FNA to the NAR. On receiving 
   the FNA from the MN, the NAR delivers the buffered packets to the
   MN. After finishing this procedure, the layer2 of the MN informs 
   the upper layer that the status of the link about to transit to 
   active from down and the MN issues FNA embedding FBU to the NAR. 
   Upon receiving FNA, the NAR verifies the availability of the 
   requesting NCoA and forwards the inner FBU to the PAR. If the NAR 
   detects the NCoA is already in use, it discards the FBU and reply 
   with Router Advertisement with NAACK option to the MN. Otherwise, 
   it delivers the packets destined to NCoA to the MN.

   Fig. 2. Proposed message flow enabling the layer-2,3 and home
   registration progress to reduce the binding registration time
   after completing predictive mode of FMIP operation over 802.16e
   
   
   This scenario enables to obtain the FMIPv6 information to move by
   scanning and joining before the handover is finished.  This draft
   proposes to eliminate the unessen-tial time after handover by 
   completing binding update at the same time with handover by 
   including the binding update into handover procedure to enhance
   the performance and to reduce the possibility of DAD fails occurring
   from moving to the NAR area with pre-configured NCoA by embedding the
   duplication-free NCoA in the response message, HAck , when the NCoA
   is sent to PAR within the FBU where in turn the message is forwarded
   to NAR carried by HI. The EAPoL frame contains the security material,
   address of HA, nonce to prevent the replay attack, secret value,
   authenticator and home address.
   
6. Security Considerations

   In this draft, AAA infrastrucure are secured by IPsec and TLS. 
   Hence, it is assumed that messages exchanging in AAA infrastructure
   are secured. However, obviously a deep security review is needed.


7. Conclusions

   Mobile IP is expected to support global roaming as it is built on IP
   protocol inde-pendent with lower layer protocol. However, the design
   rationale was to provide global roaming covering the wide range of 
   service by defining the movement detec-tion, IP configuration, 
   binding update and authentication that is not adequate for real-time
   application moving across the multiple service areas. So, more 
   sophisticated mobility support of Mobile IP is required for next 
   wireless solutions, e.g. IEEE 802.16e, demanding the real-time 
   multimedia service. 
   
   In this draft, we present the enhanced handover scheme to reduce 
   the packet loss or latency by inter-working with layer-2,layer-3 
   handoff and home registration. Also, by deploying the AAA 
   authentication service into handover procedure, we can 
   accom-plish to generate local SA during the layer-2 and FMIP 
   handover. In addition, we can avoid the possibility of duplicated
   address (nCoA) by defining the additional role of re-generating the
   duplication-free nCoA in NAR. As the result, total processing time
   including binding registration can be reduced as expected which 
   enables the real-time service with minimum latency or loss.

   he proposed scheme shows cost reduction each for Diameter and FMIP
   about 35% and 27% respectively by comparing the cost ratio of 
   proposed scheme.
