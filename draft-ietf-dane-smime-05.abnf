   The corresponding resource record in the example.com zone might look
   like:

H5I7IZR3FN4YKYGFXHQW2YDJUKDSP5RFDDB2DMZ7P5JBI===._smimecert.example.com.
   IN SMIMEA (
   0 0 1 d2abde240d7cd3ee6b4b28c54df034b9
         7983a1d16e8a410e4561cb106618e971 )

   Design note: Hashing the user name with SHA-224 and then encoding
   with Base32 allows local parts that have characters that would
   prevent their use in domain names in typical applications.  Even
   though the DNS protocol itself can use any octet value in a label,
   most applications that use DNS names are limited to a much smaller
   set of allowed characters.  For example, a period (".") is a valid
   character in a local part, but would wreak havoc in a domain name
   unless the application using the name somehow quoted it.  Similarly,
   RFC 6530 allows non-ASCII characters in local parts, and encoding a
   local part with non-ASCII characters with Base32 renders the name
   usable in applications that use the DNS.

   Wildcards can be more useful for SMIMEA than they are for TLSA.  If a
   site publishes a trust anchor certificate for all users on the site
   (certificate usage 0 or 2), it could make sense to use a wildcard
   resource record such as "*._smimecert.example.com".
