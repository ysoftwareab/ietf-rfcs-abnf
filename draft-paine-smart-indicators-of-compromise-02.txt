    Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and Their Role in Attack Defence
             draft-paine-smart-indicators-of-compromise-02

Abstract

   Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) are an important technique in attack
   defence (often called cyber defence).  This document outlines the
   different types of IoC, their associated benefits and limitations,
   and discusses their effective use.  It also contextualises the role
   of IoCs in defending against attacks through describing a recent case
   study.  This draft does not pre-suppose where IoCs can be found or
   should be detected - as they can be discovered and deployed in
   networks, endpoints or elsewhere - rather, engineers should be aware
   that they need to be detectable (either by endpoints, security
   appliances or network-based defences, or ideally all) to be
   effective.  The purpose of this draft is to document both the
   operational issues, but also the best practices associated with use
   of IoCs today.  This draft provides a foundation for proposals for
   new approaches to operational challenges in network security.

1.  Introduction

   This draft aims to describe, and illustrate the purpose of,
   Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), which are widely used in attack
   defence (often called cyber defence) as well as their effective use.
   The concept of the 'Pyramid of Pain' [PoP] will also be introduced to
   show the properties of the broad range of defences that IoCs can
   provide.  This draft will also describe a real intrusion set (a
   collection of indicators for a specific attack), delivered by APT33,
   for which IoCs were identified and used in defence.  This document is
   not a comprehensive report of APT33 and is intended to be read
   alongside APT33 open source material (for example, [Symantec]).
   Another case study, Cobalt Strike, is also included and intended to
   be read alongside open source material (for example, [NCCGroup]).

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   Attack defence: the activity of providing cyber security to an
   environment through the prevention, detection and response to
   attempted and successful cyber intrusions.  This outcome is achieved
   through the blocking, monitoring and response to adversarial activity
   at a network, host and/or application level.

   Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA): used in malware strains to
   generate domain names periodically.  Adversaries may use DGAs to
   dynamically identify a destination for command and control traffic,
   rather than relying on a list of static IP addresses or domains that
   can be blocked more easily.

   Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs): an attacker's
   manifestation or modus operandi across technology, methodologies and
   operations.  Discrete parts of an attacker's TTP can form specific
   Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) as if they were a fingerprint.

3.  What are IoCs?

   Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) are artefacts observed about an
   attacker; their tactics, techniques, procedures or associated tooling
   and infrastructure.  These indicators can be observed at a
   combination of network or endpoint (host) levels and can, with
   varying degrees of confidence, help to identify an occurrence of an
   intrusion or associated activity to a known intrusion set.  These
   IoCs are used by network defenders (blue teams) to protect their
   networks by, for example, enabling detection of compromise or pro-
   active blocking of malicious traffic.  Examples of protocol-related
   IoCs can include:

   o  IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in network traffic

   o  DNS domain names in network traffic, resolver caches or logs

   o  TLS Server Name Indication values in network traffic

   o  Code signing certificates in binaries or TLS certificate
      information in network traffic such as SHA256 hashes

   o  Cryptographic hashes (e.g.  MD5, SHA1 or SHA256) of malicious
      binaries or scripts when calculated from network traffic or file
      system artefacts

   o  Attack tools and their code structure, such as Mimikatz [Mimikatz]

   o  Attack techniques, such as Kerberos golden tickets [GoldenTicket]
      which can be observed via network traffic or system analysis

   IoCs are often discovered initially through manual investigation or
   automated analysis and then shared at scale so a variety of
   individuals and organisations can defend themselves.  They can be
   discovered in a range of sources, including in networks and at
   endpoints, but wherever they exist, they need to be made available to
   security appliances and associated apparatus to ensure that they can
   be deployed quickly and widely.  For IoCs to provide defence-in-depth
   (see Section 7), which is one of their key strengths, they should be
   deployed on both the network and on endpoints through solutions that
   have sufficient privilege to act on them, to cope with different
   points of failure.

   IoCs can be of varying quality.  An IoC without context is not much
   use for network defence - a defender could do different things with
   an IoC (e.g. monitor it, block it, log it) depending on this context.
   Without the associated context, for example the threat actor it
   relates to, the last time it was seen in use, its expected lifetime

Internet-Draft          Indicators of Compromise            January 2021


   or other related IoCs, the usefulness of an IoC is greatly reduced.
   On the other hand, an IoC delivered with context is much more useful
   to a network defender, who can then make an informed choice on how to
   use it to protect their network.

   IoCs go through a lifecycle, which includes:

   o  Development and discovery of the IoC

   o  Confidence level assignment

   o  Packaging

   o  Distribution e.g. via Malware Information Sharing Platform [MISP]

   o  Deployment

   o  Detection (useful lifetime)

   o  Investigation

   o  Actor shift resulting in new development and discovery activities

   [#TODO - check if this satisfies requests for detail on IoC lifecycle
   or if further explanation of these stages is needed for the purposes
   of this draft]

   How long an IoC remains useful will vary and be dependent on a
   variety of factors including initial confidence level, fragility and
   precision of the IoC.  For example, a connection to a known botnet
   command and control server may indicate a problem, but does not
   guarantee it.  Fragility can apply to an entire class of IoCs for a
   range of reasons; for example, IPv4 addresses are becoming more
   fragile due to addresses growing scarce, widespread use of cloud
   services and domains changing ownership.

4.  Case Study: Cobalt Strike

   Cobalt Strike is a commercial command and control framework that
   consists of an implant / beacon framework, network protocol and a
   server.  The beacon and network protocol are highly malleable.  The
   network protocol supports encryption and other techniques such as
   domain fronting to attempt to avoid obvious passive detection.

4.1.  Overall TTP

   Detection of Cobalt Strike is possible if the C2 servers themselves
   and their associate beacon configurations can be obtained.
   Tradecraft has been developed that allows the fingerprinting of these
   servers based on how they respond.  This allows the beacon
   configurations to be downloaded and the associated domain names and
   IP addresses extracted as IoCs.

4.2.  IoCs

   The resulting mass IoCs for Cobalt Strike are:

      IP addresses of the command and control servers

      domain names used

   Whilst these IoCs need to be refreshed regularly, due to the ease of
   which they can be changed, they are easily distributable.  Based on
   the authors' experience of protecting public sector organisations,
   they are also disruptive to threat actor operations that use Cobalt
   Strike.

   These IoCs cover the middle levels of the PoP (see Section 6).
   Additionally, these IoCs can be used to check historical data for
   evidence of past compromise, as well as deployed to block further
   infection and/or to detect infection in a timely manner, thereby
   contributing to preventing the loss of user and system data.

5.  Why use IoCs?

5.1.  IoCs can be used even with limited resource

   IoCs are scalable and easy to deploy which makes them a really
   valuable asset for smaller entities.  IoCs are also inexpensive to
   use.  For example, take a small manufacturing subcontractor in a
   supply chain that produces a critical, highly specialised, component.
   The small manufacturer represents an attractive target because there
   would be disproportionate impact on both the supply chain and the
   prime contractor if it were compromised.  In addition, it is likely
   to have comparatively smaller resource to manage the risks it faces.
   It is reasonable to assume that this small manufacturer will have
   only basic security (in the form of firewalls, similar network
   protection devices, or an outsource agreement), however it can still
   leverage IoCs to great effect.  IoCs can be deployed to give a
   baseline protection against known threats by small entities without
   access to a significant defensive team or the threat intelligence
   relationships necessary to perform resource-intensive investigation.

Internet-Draft          Indicators of Compromise            January 2021


   In addition, as detailed further in Section 5.2, the prime contractor
   can also supply IoCs to the subcontractor to provide an uplift in
   defensive capability in order to protect the prime contractor.
   Affording some level of protection to organisations across a spectrum
   of resource, maturity, and sophistication is a major part of the
   appeal for IoCs.

5.2.  IoCs have a multiplier effect on attack defence effort

   The correspondence is one-to-many: simply blocking one IoC may
   protect thousands of users within an organisation.  Discovering one
   IoC can be intensive, but sharing IoCs via well-established routes
   such as the Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) [MISP] will
   protect thousands of organisations and end users.  The shareability
   and reproducibility of IoCs is a huge advantage; it allows a threat
   defender to look for things consistently and automate the process of
   defending their networks.  It doesn't require intensive training (as
   needed to, for example, manually analyse tipped machine learning
   events), nor does it require time-intensive resource to deploy IoCs.

   In the case of an ongoing email phishing campaign, IoCs can be
   monitored, discovered and deployed quickly and easily.  If they are
   deployed quickly via a mechanism such as a protective DNS filtering
   service, they can be more effective still, as the same email campaign
   is mitigated before a recipient clicks the link or before malicious
   payloads can call out for instructions.  While this approach can
   therefore be faster than some traditional defences, the most
   important benefit is that other parties can be protected without
   additional effort.

5.3.  IoCs are easily shareable

   This is due to two major factors: firstly, because lists of
   identifiers are easy to distribute, and secondly, due to standards
   such as Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) [STIX] that
   provide a well-defined format for sharing.  This allows IoCs to give
   blanket coverage for organisations and allow widespread mitigation in
   a timely fashion.  They can be shared with systems administrators -
   from small to large organisations, from large teams to a single
   individual - allowing them to implement defences on their network.

5.4.  IoCs can be attributed to specific threat actors

   Deployment of various modern system security services, such as
   endpoint detection and response or firewall filtering, comes with an
   inherent trade-off between breadth of protection and risk of false
   positives (see Section 6).  An organisation can examine their own
   risk, impact and threat - they can perform their own information



Paine & Whitehouse        Expires July 17, 2021                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          Indicators of Compromise            January 2021


   assurance and threat modelling - and work to manage those threats
   they wish to.  This means an organisation can prioritise or accept
   trade-offs against a subset of malicious actors; tying IoCs to threat
   actors allows organisations to focus their defences against
   particular risks.  Organisations should have the technical freedom
   and the capability to choose their risk posture and defence methods.

5.5.  IoCs can provide significant time savings

   Not only are there time savings from sharing IoCs, saving duplication
   of investigation effort, but deploying them automatically at scale is
   seamless for many enterprises.  Where automatic deployment of IoCs is
   working well, organisations and users get blanket protection with
   minimal human intervention and minimal effort, a key goal of attack
   defence.  The ability to do this at scale and at pace is often vital
   to respond to agile threat actors.  Conversely, protecting a complex
   network without automatic deployment of IoCs could mean updating
   every single endpoint or network device consistently and reliably to
   the same security level.  The work this entails (including polling
   for logs, locating assets and devices, and manually checking patch
   levels) introduces complexity and a need for skilled analysts.  While
   it is still necessary to invest effort to eliminate false positives
   when widely deploying IoCs, the cost and effort involved can be far
   smaller than the work entailed in reliably patching all endpoint and
   network devices - for example, particularly on legacy systems that
   may be particularly complicated, or even impossible, to update.

5.6.  IoCs allow for discovery of historic attacks

   A network defender can use recently acquired IoCs in conjunction with
   historic data, such as logged DNS queries or email attachment hashes,
   to hunt for signs of past compromise.  Not only can this technique
   help to build up a clear picture of past attacks, but it also allows
   for retrospective mitigation of the effects of any previous
   intrusion.  This use case is reliant on historic data not having been
   compromised itself, by a technique such as Timestomp [Timestomp], or
   being incomplete due to third party policies, but is nonetheless
   valuable for detecting past attacks.

5.7.  IoCs underpin and enable multiple layers of the modern defence-in-
      depth strategy

   Firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems and Security Incident Event
   Management platforms all employ IoCs to identify and mitigate
   threats.  Anti-Virus (AV) products, as part of a multi-faceted
   approach, deploy IoCs via catalogues or libraries to all supported
   client endpoints.  Of course, IoCs do not address all attack defence

Internet-Draft          Indicators of Compromise            January 2021


   challenges - but they form a vital tier of any organisation's layered
   defence.

   As an example, open source malware can be deployed by many different
   actors, each with their own modus operandi, commonly called "Tactics,
   Techniques and Procedures" (TTPs), and their own infrastructure.
   However, if the same executable is used, the hash remains the same -
   and this IoC can be deployed in endpoints through AV to protect
   regardless of TTP and infrastructure.  Should this defence fail
   however, other defences can prevent malicious actors progressing
   further through the attack chain - for instance, by blocking known
   malicious domain name look-ups and thereby preventing the malware
   calling out to its command and control infrastructure.

   A different malicious actor changes the intrusion set deployed across
   different campaigns, but their access vectors often remain consistent
   and well-known.  Therefore, this TTP and pattern of activity can be
   recognised and proactively defended against.  For example, if their
   access vector consistently exploits a vulnerability in software,
   regular and estate-wide patching can prevent the attack from taking
   place.  Should these pre-emptive measures fail however, other IoCs
   observed across multiple campaigns can be used to prevent the attack
   at different stages in the attack chain.  Hence, IoCs can underpin
   multiple layers of any modern defence-in-depth strategy.

6.  Pain, Fragility and Precision

   The variety of IoC types inherently embody a set of trade-offs
   between the risk of false positives (misidentifying non-malicious
   traffic as malicious) and the risk of failing to identify attacks.
   The pain of modifying attacks to subvert known IoCs inversely
   correlates with both the fragility of various IoCs as a tool for
   attack defence, and the precision with which IoCs identify an attack.
   Research is needed to elucidate the exact nature of these trade-offs
   between pain, fragility and precision.

6.1.  Pyramid of Pain

   IoCs form a "Pyramid of Pain" [PoP] that can be used for prevention,
   detection and mitigation.  This represents how much pain it is to an
   adversary to change.  The layers of the PoP range from hashes to TTPs
   and the pain ranges from recompiling code to creating a new attack
   strategy.

   On the lowest (and least painful) level are hashes of malicious
   files.  These are easy for a defender to gather and can be deployed
   to firewalls, for example, to block malicious downloads.  To subvert
   this defence, however, an adversary need only recompile code with



Paine & Whitehouse        Expires July 17, 2021                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft          Indicators of Compromise            January 2021


   some trivial changes, thereby changing the hash.  IoCs aren't the
   only route for doing this blocking but are a quick, less intrusive
   and more convenient method.

   The next two levels are IPs and domain names.  These are blockable,
   with varying false positive rates (see Section 6.4), and often cause
   more pain to an adversary to subvert; they may have to change IP
   ranges, find a new provider, and change their code if the IP address
   is hard-coded (rather than resolved).  Domain names are more granular
   than IP addresses and are more painful for an adversary to change.

   Network and host artefacts, such as changed timestamps of files left
   on the endpoint (see [Timestomp]) or a beaconing pattern on the
   network, are harder still to change, as they relate specifically to
   the attack taking place and may not be under the direct control of
   the attacker.

   Tools and TTPs form the top two layers of the pyramid; these layers
   describe a threat actor's methodology - the way they perform the
   attack.  An example could be deployment of malicious code to perform
   reconnaissance of a victim's network, which pivots laterally to a
   valuable endpoint, then downloads a ransomware payload.  Tools refer
   to the software used to conduct the attack, whereas TTPs relate to
   the broader attack strategy being used.  Information on TTPs and
   Tools take intensive effort to diagnose on the part of the defender,
   but they are fundamental to the attacker and campaign and hence
   incredibly painful for the adversary to change.

6.2.  Fragility

   For a network defender, the PoP can also be thought of in terms of
   fragility.  The less painful it is for the attacker to change the
   IoC, the more fragile that IoC is as an attack defence tool.  It
   should be relatively simple to get a hash of the various file
   attachments (and then deploy this through AV or other means) or to
   get the email subject.  However, when thinking in terms of fragility,
   the hash IoCs or email subjects are fragile and can be changed; in
   reality, they will be changed easily between campaigns.  IPs and
   domain names can also be changed between campaigns, but it is harder
   - and if the IoCs didn't change but weren't blocked, that's a missed
   opportunity.

6.3.  Precision

   The PoP can be also considered in terms of how precise the defence
   can be, with the false positive rate roughly increasing as we move up
   the pyramid.  A hash (e.g.  MD5, SHA1 or SHA2) can specify a
   particular executable, so the false positive is nil.  On the other
   hand, TTPs or fuzzier rules may apply to various binaries, and even
   benign software may share the same identifying methodology.  This
   corresponds with the consequences for fragility mentioned above, as
   the more precise IoCs, such as hashes, are also the most fragile.

6.4.  Comprehensive Coverage

   IoCs provide the defender with a range of options across the PoP
   layers, balancing between precision and fragility to give high
   confidence events that are practical and useful.  Broad coverage of
   the PoP is important as it allows the defender to cycle between high
   precision but high fragility options and more robust but less precise
   indicators.  As fragile indicators are changed, the more robust IoCs
   allow for continued detection and faster rediscovery.  This is why
   it's important to collect as many IoCs as possible across the whole
   PoP.

Internet-Draft          Indicators of Compromise            January 2021


   At the top of the PoP, TTPs identified through anomaly detection and
   machine learning are more likely to have false positives, which gives
   lower confidence and, vitally, requires better trained analysts to
   understand and implement the defences.  Hashes, at the bottom, are
   precise and easy to deploy but are fragile and easily changed within
   and across campaigns by malicious actors.

   In the middle of the pyramid, IoCs related to network information
   (such as domains and IP addresses) can be particularly useful.  They
   allow for broad coverage, without requiring each and every endpoint
   security solution to be updated.  This means they can shine in
   contexts where ensuring endpoint security isn't possible such as
   "Bring Your Own Device" (BYOD), IoT and legacy environments.  Using
   these network level IoCs can also protect against a compromised
   endpoint as, even if the compromise passes unnoticed, the IoCs can
   still be checked against network traffic, allowing detection of the
   attack.  For example, in a BYOD environment, enforcing security
   policies on the device can be difficult, so non-endpoint IoCs and
   solutions are needed to allow detection of compromise even with no
   endpoint coverage.

   Covering a broad range of IoCs gives defenders a wide range of
   benefits: easy to deploy, high confidence enough to be effective,
   painful enough to change and disruptive to bad actors.  The
   combination of these factors cements IoCs as a particularly valuable
   tool for defenders with limited resources.

7.  Defence in Depth

   Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) or Anti-Virus (AV) are often
   the first port of call for protection from intrusion but endpoitn
   solutions aren't a panacea.  One issue is that there are many
   environments where it is not possible to keep them updated, or in
   some cases, deploy them at all.  For example, the Owari botnet, a
   Mirai variant [Owari], exploited Internet of Things (IoT) devices
   where such solutions could not be deployed.  It is because of such
   gaps, where endpoint solutions can't be relied on (see [CLESS]), that
   a defence-in-depth approach is commonly advocated, using a blended
   approach that includes both network and endpoint defences.

   If an attack happens, then you hope an endpoint solution will pick it
   up.  If it doesn't, it could be for many good reasons: the endpoint
   solution could be quite conservative and aim for a low false-positive
   rate, it might not have ubiquitous coverage or it might only be able
   to defend the initial step of the kill chain [KillChain].  In the
   worst cases, the attack specifically disables the endpoint solution
   or the malware is brand new and so won't be recognised.  Going up the
   pyramid, IP addresses are next, and here we have ACLs (access control



Paine & Whitehouse        Expires July 17, 2021                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft          Indicators of Compromise            January 2021


   lists) that can go on firewalls - or your favourite DNS filtering
   service for protection.  Using IPs will blanket-defend a range of
   endpoints, from printers [IoT] to "Bring Your Own Device" (BYOD) to
   capable endpoints.  Going further through the pyramid, domains are
   next - these are more granular.

   One example of how IoCs provide a layer of a defence-in-depth
   solution is Protective DNS (PDNS), a free and voluntary DNS filtering
   service provided by the UK NCSC for UK public sector organisations
   [PDNS].  In 2018, this service blocked access to 57.4 million DNS
   queries for 118,527 unique reasons (out of 68.7 billion total
   queries) for the organisations signed up to the service [ACD2019]. 28
   million of them were for domain generation algorithms (DGAs) [DGAs],
   including 15 known DGAs which are a type of TTP.

   IoCs such as malicious domains can be put on PDNS straight away and
   can then be used to prevent access to those known malicious domains
   across the entire estate of over 460 separate public sector entities
   that use NCSC's PDNS [Annual2019].  Coverage can be patchy with
   endpoints, as the roll-out of protections isn't uniform or
   necessarily fast - but if the IoC is on PDNS, a consistent defence is
   maintained.  This offers protection, regardless of whether the
   context is a BYOD environment or a managed enterprise system.  Other
   IoCs, like Server Name Indicator values in TLS or the server
   certificate information, also provide IoC protections.

   Similar to the AV scenario, large scale services face risk decisions
   around balancing threat against business impact from false positives.
   Organisations need to be able to retain the ability to be more
   conservative with their own defences, while still benefiting from
   them.  For instance, a commercial DNS filtering service is intended
   for broad deployment, so will have a risk tolerance similar to AV
   products; whereas DNS filtering intended for government users (e.g.
   PDNS) can be more conservative, but will still have a relatively
   broad deployment if intended for the whole of government.  A
   government department or specific company, on the other hand, might
   accept the risk of disruption and arrange firewalls or other network
   protection devices to completely block anything related to particular
   threats, regardless of the confidence, but rely on a DNS filtering
   service for everything else.

   Other network defences can make use of this blanket coverage from
   IoCs, like middlebox mitigation, proxy defences, and application
   layer firewalls, but they're out of scope for this draft.  Note too
   that DNS goes through firewalls, proxies and possibly to a DNS
   filtering service; it doesn't have to be unencrypted, but these
   appliances must be able to decrypt it to do anything useful with it,
   like blocking queries for known bad URIs.

8.  Security Considerations

   This draft is all about system security.  However, when poorly
   deployed, IoCs can lead to over-blocking which may present an
   availability concern for some systems.  While IoCs preserve privacy
   on a macro scale (by preventing data breaches), research could be
   done to investigate the impact on privacy from sharing IoCs, and
   improvements could be made to minimise any impact found.  The
   creation of a privacy-preserving IoC sharing method, that still
   allows both network and endpoint defences to provide security and
   layered defences, would be an interesting proposal.

9.  Conclusions

   IoCs are versatile and powerful.  IoCs underpin and enable multiple
   of the layers of the modern defence-in-depth strategy.  IoCs are easy
   to share, providing a multiplier effect on attack defence effort and
   they save vital time.  Network-level IoCs offer protection,
   especially valuable when an endpoint-only solution isn't sufficient.
   These properties, along with their ease of use, make IoCs a key
   component of any attack defence strategy and particularly valuable
   for defenders with limited resources.

   For IoCs to be useful, they don't have to be unencrypted or visible
   in networks - but crucially they do need to be made available, along
   with their context, to entities that need them.  It is also important
   that this availability and eventual usage copes with multiple points
   of failure, as per the defence-in-depth strategy, of which IoCs are a
   key part.

Appendix A.  Case Study: APT33

   To further contextualise IoCs, we describe a real-world case study: a
   current campaign by the threat actor APT33, also known as Elfin and
   Refined Kitten (see [Symantec]).  APT33 has been assessed by industry
   to be a state-sponsored group [FireEye], yet in this case study, IoCs
   still gave defenders an effective tool against such a sophisticated
   and powerful adversary.  The group has been active since at least
   2015 and is known to target a range of sectors including
   petrochemical, government, engineering and manufacturing.  Activity
   has been seen in countries across the globe, but predominantly in the
   USA and Saudi Arabia.

A.1.  Overall TTP

   The techniques employed by this actor exhibit a relatively low level
   of sophistication: typically, spear phishing is used with document
   lures that imitate legitimate publications.  Once inside a target
   network, the actor will attempt to pivot to other machines to gather
   documents and gain access to administrative credentials.  In some
   cases, users are tricked into providing credentials that are then
   used to enable the use of RULER, a freely available tool that allows
   exploitation of an email client.  The attacker, in possession of a
   target's password, uses RULER to access the target's mail account,
   and embed a malicious script which will be triggered when the mail
   client is next opened, resulting in the execution of malicious code
   (often additional malware retrieved from the Internet) (see
   [FireEye2]).

   When a destructive tool is deployed, it relies on overwriting the
   master boot record (MBR) of the hard drives in as many PCs as
   possible.  This type of tool, known as a wiper, results in data loss
   and renders devices unusable until the operating system is
   reinstalled.  In some cases, the actor is able to use administrator
   credentials to invoke execution across a large swathe of a company's
   IT estate at once; where this isn't possible the actor may attempt to
   spread the wiper to as many PCs as possible manually, or by using
   wormlike capabilities against unpatched vulnerabilities on the
   internal network.

A.2.  IoCs

   As a result of investigations by both industry and NCSC in
   partnership, a set of IoCs were compiled that could then be shared
   out with government and industry to enable network defenders to
   search for these indicators in their networks.  Detection of these
   IoCs is likely indicative of APT33 targeting and could indicate
   potential compromise and subsequent use of destructive malware.
   Network defenders could also initiate processes to block these IoCs
   and foil future attacks.  This set of IoCs comprised:

   o  9 fragile indicators including hashes and email subject lines

   o  5 IP addresses

   o  7 domains

   These IoCs mostly cover the bottom few levels of the PoP, with the
   network level IoCs giving resilience not provided by the fragile
   indicators.  Not only can these IoCs be used to check historical data
   for evidence of past compromise, but they can also be deployed to

   manner, thereby contributing to preventing the loss of user and
   system data.
