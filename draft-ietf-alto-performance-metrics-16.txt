                     ALTO Performance Cost Metrics
                 draft-ietf-alto-performance-metrics-16

Abstract

   Cost metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic
   Optimization (ALTO), and different applications may use different
   cost metrics.  Since the ALTO base protocol (RFC 7285) defines only a
   single cost metric (i.e., the generic "routingcost" metric), if an
   application wants to issue a cost map or an endpoint cost request to
   determine the resource provider that offers better delay performance,
   the base protocol does not define the cost metric to be used.

   This document addresses the issue by introducing network performance
   metrics, including network delay, jitter, packet loss rate, hop
   count, and bandwidth.

   There are multiple sources (e.g., estimation based on measurements or
   service-level agreement) to derive a performance metric.  This
   document introduces an additional "cost-context" field to the ALTO
   "cost-type" field to convey the source of a performance metric.

Internet-Draft        ALTO Performance Cost Metrics            July 2021


1.  Introduction

   Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) provides a means for
   network applications to obtain network status information so that the
   applications can identify efficient application-layer traffic
   patterns using the networks.  Cost Metric is a basic concept in
   realizing ALTO, and the concept is used in both the ALTO cost map
   service and the ALTO endpoint cost service in the ALTO base protocol
   [RFC7285].

   Since different applications may use different cost metrics, the ALTO
   base protocol introduces an ALTO Cost Metric Registry (Section 14.2
   of [RFC7285]), as a systematic mechanism to allow different metrics
   to be specified.  For example, a delay-sensitive application may want
   to use latency related metrics, and a bandwidth-sensitive application
   may want to use bandwidth related metrics.  However, the ALTO base
   protocol has registered only a single cost metric, i.e., the generic
   "routingcost" metric (see Sec. 14.2 of [RFC7285]); no latency or
   bandwidth related metrics are defined.

   This document registers a set of new cost metrics specified in
   Table 1, to allow applications to determine "where" to connect based
   on network performance criteria such as delay and bandwidth related
   metrics.  This document follows the guideline defined in Section 14.2
   of the ALTO base protocol [RFC7285]) on registering ALTO cost
   metrics.  Hence it specifies the identifier, the intended semantics,
   and the security considerations of each one of the metrics defined in
   Table 1.

      Table 1. Cost Metrics Defined in this Document.

   The purpose of this document is to ensure proper usage of the
   performance metrics defined in Table 1; it does not claim novelty of
   the metrics.  The "Origin Example" column of Table 1 gives an example
   RFC that has defined each metric.

Internet-Draft        ALTO Performance Cost Metrics            July 2021


   The performance metrics can be classified into two categories: those
   derived from the performance of individual packets (i.e., one-way
   delay, round-trip delay, delay variation, hop count, and loss rate),
   and those related with bandwidth (TCP throughput, residual bandwidth,
   and maximum reservable bandwidth).  These two categories are defined
   in Sections 3 and 4 respectively.  Note that all metrics except round
   trip delay in Table 1 are unidirectional; hence, a client will need
   to query both directions if needed.

   An ALTO server may provide only a subset of the metrics described in
   this document.  For example, those that are subject to privacy
   concerns should not be provided to unauthorized ALTO clients.  Hence,
   all cost metrics defined in this document are optional and not all of
   them need to be exposed to a given application.  When an ALTO server
   supports a cost metric defined in this document, it should announce
   this metric in its information resource directory (IRD).

   [RFC7285] specifies that cost values should be assumed by default as
   JSONNumber.  When defining the value representation of each metric in
   Table 1, this document conforms to this specification, but specifies
   additional, generic constraints on valid JSONNumbers for each metric.
   For example, each metric in Table 1 will be specified as non-negative
   (>= 0); Hop Count is specified to be an integer.

   An ALTO server introducing these metrics should consider security
   issues.  As a generic security consideration on the reliability and
   trust in the exposed metric values, applications SHOULD rapidly give
   up using ALTO-based guidance if they detect that the exposed
   information does not preserve their performance level or even
   degrades it.  This document discusses security considerations in more
   detail in Section 6.

   Following the ALTO base protocol, this document uses JSON to specify
   the value type of each defined metric.  See [RFC8259] for JSON data
   type specification.

2.  Performance Metric Attributes

   When defining the metrics in Table 1, this document considers the
   guideline specified in [RFC6390], which requires that the fine-
   grained specification of a network performance metric include 6
   components: (i) Metric Name, (ii) Metric Description, (iii) Method of
   Measurement or Calculation, (iv) Units of Measurement, (v)
   Measurement Points, and (vi) Measurement Timing.  Requiring that an
   ALTO server provide precise, fine-grained values for all 6 components
   for each metric that it exposes may not be feasible or necessary for
   all ALTO use cases.  For example, the method of measurement or




Wu, et al.              Expires January 12, 2022                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft        ALTO Performance Cost Metrics            July 2021


   calculation can be complex with substantial details that cannot be
   exposed to or are unnecessary for ALTO clients in many use cases.

   To address the issue and realize ALTO use cases, for metrics in
   Table 1, this document defines performance metric identifiers which
   can be used in the ALTO protocol with well-defined (i) Metric Name,
   (ii) Metric Description, (iv) Units of Measurement, and (v)
   Measurement Points, which are always specified by the specific ALTO
   services; for example, endpoint cost service is between the two
   endpoints.  We say that the ALTO performance metric identifiers
   provide basic metric attributes.

   To allow the flexibility of allowing an ALTO server to provide fine-
   grain information such as Method of Measurement or Calculation,
   according to its policy and use cases, this document introduces
   context information so that the server can provide these additional
   details.

2.1.  Performance Metric Context: cost-context

   The core additional details of a performance metric specify "how" the
   metric is obtained.  This is referred to as the source of the metric.
   Specifically, this document defines three types of coarse-grained
   metric information sources: "nominal", and "sla" (service level
   agreement), and "estimation".

   For a given type of source, precise interpretation of a performance
   metric value can depend on particular measurement and computation
   parameters.  For example, see Section 3.8 of [RFC7679] on items that
   a more complete measurement-based report should include.

   To make it possible to specify the source and the aforementioned
   parameters, this document introduces an optional "cost-context" field
   to the "cost-type" field defined by the ALTO base protocol
   (Section 10.7 of [RFC7285]) as the following:

Internet-Draft        ALTO Performance Cost Metrics            July 2021


       object {
         CostMetric   cost-metric;
         CostMode     cost-mode;
         [CostContext cost-context;]
         [JSONString  description;]
       } CostType;

       object {
         JSONString    cost-source;
         [JSONValue    parameters;]
       } CostContext;



   The "cost-source" field of the "cost-context" field MUST be one of
   three category values: "nominal", "sla", and "estimation".  "cost-
   context" will not be used as a key to distinguish among performance
   metrics.  Hence, an ALTO information resource MUST NOT announce
   multiple CostType with the same "cost-metric" and "cost-mode".  They
   must be placed into different information resources.

   The "nominal" category indicates that the metric value is statically
   configured by the underlying devices.  Not all metrics have
   reasonable "nominal" values.  For example, throughput can have a
   nominal value, which indicates the configured transmission rate of
   the devices; latency typically does not have a nominal value.

   The "sla" category indicates that the metric value is derived from
   some commitment which this document refers to as service-level
   agreement (SLA).  Some operators also use terms such as "target" or
   "committed" values.  For an "sla" metric, it is RECOMMENDED that the
   "parameters" field provides a link to the SLA definition.

   The "estimation" category indicates that the metric value is computed
   through an estimation process.  An ALTO server may compute
   "estimation" values by retrieving and/or aggregating information from
   routing protocols (e.g., [RFC8571]) and traffic measurement
   management tools (e.g., TWAMP [RFC5357]), with corresponding
   operational issues.  A potential architecture on estimating these
   metrics is shown in Figure 1 below.  Section 5 will discuss in more
   detail the operational issues and how a network may address them.

   There can be multiple choices in deciding the cost-source category.
   It is the operator of an ALTO server who chooses the category.  If a
   metric does not include a "cost-source" value, the application MUST
   assume that the value of "cost-source" is the most generic
   "estimation".

2.2.  Performance Metric Statistics

   The measurement of a performance metric often yields a set of samples
   from an observation distribution ([Prometheus]), instead of a single
   value.  This document considers that the samples are aggregated as a
   statistic when reported.  Hence, each performance metric's identifier
   should indicate the statistic (i.e., an aggregation operation), to
   become


     <metric-identifier> ::= <metric-base-identifier> [ '-' <stat> ]


   where <stat> MUST be one of the following:

   percentile, with letter 'p' followed by a number:

      gives the p percentile.  Specifically, consider the samples coming
      from a random variable X.  The metric returns x, relative to 100,
      such that the probability of X is less than or equal to x, i.e.,
      Prob(X <= x) = p/100.  The number p MUST be a non-negative JSON

      number in the range [0, 100] (i.e., greater than or equal to 0 and
      less than or equal to 100).  To avoid complex identifiers, the
      number MUST NOT include the minus or the exp component (Section 6
      of [RFC8259]).  For example, delay-ow-p75 gives the 75% percentile
      of observed one-way delay; delay-ow-p99.9 gives the 99.9%
      percentile of delay.  Note that some systems use quantile, which
      is in the range [0, 1].  This document uses percentile to make the
      identifier easier to read.



   min:

      the minimal value of the observations.



   max:

      the maximal value of the observations.



   median:

      the mid point (i.e., p50) of the observations.



   mean:

      the arithmetic mean value of the observations.



   stddev:

      the standard deviation of the observations.



   stdvar:

      the standard variance of the observations.

   If a metric has no <stat> (i.e., <metric-identifier> does not include
   '-' <stat>), the metric MUST be considered as the 50 percentile
   (median).

3.  Packet Performance Metrics

   This section introduces ALTO network performance metrics on one way
   delay, round trip delay, delay variation, hop count, and packet loss
   rate.  They measure the "quality of experience" of the stream of
   packets sent from a resource provider to a resource consumer.  The
   measures of each individual packet (pkt) can include the delay from
   the time when the packet enters the network to the time when the
   packet leaves the network (pkt.delay); the number of network hops
   that the packet traverses (pkt.hopcount); and whether the packet is
   dropped before reaching the destination (pkt.dropped).  The semantics
   of the performance metrics defined in this section is that they are
   statistics (percentiles) computed from these measures; for example,
   the x-percentile of the one-way delay is the x-percentile of the set
   of delays {pkt.delay} for the packets in the stream.

3.1.  Cost Metric: One-Way Delay (delay-ow)

3.1.1.  Base Identifier

   The base identifier for this performance metric is "delay-ow".

3.1.2.  Value Representation

   The metric value type is a single 'JSONNumber' type value conforming
   to the number specification of [RFC8259] Section 6.  The unit is
   expressed in milliseconds.  Hence, the number can be a floating point
   number to express delay that is smaller than milliseconds.  The
   number MUST be non-negative.

3.1.3.  Intended Semantics and Use

   Intended Semantics: To specify the spatial and temporal aggregated
   delay of a stream of packets from the specified source and the
   specified destination.  The spatial aggregation level is specified in
   the query context (e.g., PID to PID, or endpoint to endpoint).

   Use: This metric could be used as a cost metric constraint attribute
   or as a returned cost metric in the response.

3.1.4.  Cost-Context Specification Considerations

   "nominal": Typically network one-way delay does not have a nominal
   value.

   "sla": Many networks provide delay in their application-level service
   level agreements.  It is RECOMMENDED that the "parameters" field of
   an "sla" one-way delay metric includes a link (i.e., a field named
   "link") providing an URI to the specification of SLA details, if
   available.  This specification can be either free text for human
   read, or a formal specification.  The format of the specification is
   out of the scope of this document.

   "estimation": The exact estimation method is out of the scope of this
   document.  There can be multiple sources to estimate one-way delay.
   For example, the server may use [RFC8571] (by using unidirectional
   link delay, min/max unidirectional link delay) to estimate the path
   delay.  During estimation, the server should be cognizant of
   potential issues when computing an end-to-end summary statistic from
   link statistics.  Another example of a source to estimate the delay
   is the IPPM framework [I-D.ietf-ippm-initial-registry].  It is
   RECOMMENDED that the "parameters" field of an "estimation" one-way
   delay metric includes a link (a field named "link") providing an URI
   to a description of the "estimation" method.  This description can be
   either free text for human read, or a formal specification; see
   Section 4 of [I-D.ietf-ippm-initial-registry] for fields which should
   be included.  The format of description is out of the scope of this
   document.

3.2.  Cost Metric: Round-trip Delay (delay-rt)

3.2.1.  Base Identifier

   The base identifier for this performance metric is "delay-rt".

3.2.2.  Value Representation

   The metric value type is a single 'JSONNumber' type value conforming
   to the number specification of [RFC8259] Section 6.  The number MUST
   be non-negative.  The unit is expressed in milliseconds.

3.2.3.  Intended Semantics and Use

   Intended Semantics: To specify spatial and temporal aggregated round-
   trip delay between the specified source and specified destination.
   The spatial aggregation level is specified in the query context
   (e.g., PID to PID, or endpoint to endpoint).

   Note that it is possible for a client to query two one-way delays and
   then compute the round-trip delay.  The server should be cognizant of
   the consistency of values.

   Use: This metric could be used either as a cost metric constraint
   attribute or as a returned cost metric in the response.

3.2.4.  Cost-Context Specification Considerations

   "nominal": Typically network round-trip delay does not have a nominal
   value.

   "sla": It is RECOMMENDED that the "parameters" field of an "sla"
   round-trip delay metric includes a link (a fielf named "link")
   providing an URI to the specification of SLA details, if available.
   This specification can be either free text for human read, or a

   see Section 3.1.4 for related discussions on the link.

3.3.  Cost Metric: Delay Variation (delay-variation)

3.3.1.  Base Identifier

   The base identifier for this performance metric is "delay-variation".

3.3.2.  Value Representation

   The metric value type is a single 'JSONNumber' type value conforming
   to the number specification of [RFC8259] Section 6.  The number MUST
   be non-negative.  The unit is expressed in milliseconds.

3.3.3.  Intended Semantics and Use

   Intended Semantics: To specify spatial and temporal aggregated delay
   variation (also called delay jitter)) with respect to the minimum
   delay observed on the stream over the specified source and
   destination.  The spatial aggregation level is specified in the query
   context (e.g., PID to PID, or endpoint to endpoint).

   Note that in statistics, variations are typically evaluated by the
   distance from samples relative to the mean.  In networking context,
   it is more commonly defined from samples relative to the min.  This
   definition follows the networking convention.

   Use: This metric could be used either as a cost metric constraint
   attribute or as a returned cost metric in the response.

   is RECOMMENDED that the "parameters" field of an "estimation" TCP
   throughput metric provides a link ("link") to a description of the
   "estimation" method.  This description can be either free text for
   human read, or a formal specification.  The semantics is out of the
   scope of this document.

4.2.  Cost Metric: Residual Bandwidth (bw-residual)

4.2.1.  Base Identifier

   The base identifier for this performance metric is "bw-residual".

4.2.2.  Value Representation

   The metric value type is a single 'JSONNumber' type value that is
   non-negative.  The unit of measurement is bytes per second.

4.2.3.  Intended Semantics and Use

   Intended Semantics: To specify spatial and temporal residual
   bandwidth from the specified source and the specified destination.
   The value is calculated by subtracting tunnel reservations from
   Maximum Bandwidth (motivated from [RFC8570], Section 4.5).  The
   spatial aggregation unit is specified in the query context (e.g., PID
   to PID, or endpoint to endpoint).

   Use: This metric could be used either as a cost metric constraint
   attribute or as a returned cost metric in the response.

   "estimation": The exact estimation method is out of the scope of this
   document.  There can be multiple sources to estimate maximum
   reservable bandwidth.  For example, Maximum reservable bandwidth is
   defined by IS-IS/OSPF TE, and measures the reservable bandwidth
   between two directly connected IS-IS neighbors or OSPF neighbors; see
   Section 3.5 of [RFC5305].  An estimtation can also be computed from
   [RFC8571] (by using unidirectional maximum reservable bandwidth).  It
   is RECOMMENDED that the "parameters" field of an "estimation" maximum
   reservable bandwidth metric provides a link ("link") to a description
   of the "estimation" method.  This description can be either free text
   for human read, or a formal specification.  The semantics is out of
   the scope of this document.

5.  Operational Considerations

   The exact measurement infrastructure, measurement condition, and
   computation algorithms can vary from different networks, and are
   outside the scope of this document.  Both the ALTO server and the
   ALTO clients, however, need to be cognizant of the operational issues
   discussed below.

   Also, the performance metrics specified in this document are similar,
   in that they may use similar data sources and have similar issues in
   their calculation.  Hence, we specify common issues unless one metric
   has its unique challenges.

5.1.  Source Considerations

   The addition of the "cost-source" field is to solve a key issue: An
   ALTO server needs data sources to compute the cost metrics described
   in this document, and an ALTO client needs to know the data sources
   to better interpret the values.

   To avoid too fine-grained information, this document introduces
   "cost-source" to indicate only the high-level type of data sources:
   "estimation" or "sla", where "estimation" is a type of measurement
   data source, and "sla" is a type that is more based on policy.

   For estimation, for example, the ALTO server may use log servers or
   the OAM system as its data source as recommended by [RFC7971].  In
   particular, the cost metrics defined in this document can be computed
   using routing systems as the data sources.

5.2.  Metric Timestamp Consideration

   Despite the introduction of the additional cost-context information,
   the metrics do not have a field to indicate the timestamps of the
   data used to compute the metrics.  To indicate this attribute, the



Wu, et al.              Expires January 12, 2022               [Page 26]

Internet-Draft        ALTO Performance Cost Metrics            July 2021


   ALTO server SHOULD return HTTP "Last-Modified", to indicate the
   freshness of the data used to compute the performance metrics.

   If the ALTO client obtains updates through an incremental update
   mechanism [RFC8895]), the client SHOULD assume that the metric is
   computed using a snapshot at the time that is approximated by the
   receiving time.

5.3.  Backward Compatibility Considerations

   One potential issue introduced by the optional "cost-source" field is
   backward compatibility.  Consider that an IRD which defines two cost-
   types with the same "cost-mode" and "cost-metric", but one with
   "cost-source" being "estimation" and the other being "sla".  Then an
   ALTO client that is not aware of the extension will not be able to
   distinguish between these two types.  A similar issue can arise even
   with a single cost-type, whose "cost-source" is "sla": an ALTO client
   that is not aware of this extension will ignore this field and
   consider the metric estimation.

   To address the backward-compatibility issue, if a "cost-metric" is
   "routingcost" and the metric contains a "cost-context" field, then it
   MUST be "estimation"; if it is not, the client SHOULD reject the
   information as invalid.

5.4.  Computation Considerations

   The metric values exposed by an ALTO server may result from
   additional processing on measurements from data sources to compute
   exposed metrics.  This may involve data processing tasks such as
   aggregating the results across multiple systems, removing outliers,
   and creating additional statistics.  There are two challenges on the
   computation of ALTO performance metrics.

5.4.1.  Configuration Parameters Considerations

   Performance metrics often depend on configuration parameters, and
   exposing such configuration parameters can help an ALTO client to
   better understand the exposed metrics.  In particular, an ALTO server
   may be configured to compute a TE metric (e.g., packet loss rate) in
   fixed intervals say every T seconds.  To expose this information, the
   ALTO server may provide the client with two pieces of additional
   information: (1) when the metrics are last computed, and (2) when the
   metrics will be updated (i.e., the validity period of the exposed
   metric values).  The ALTO server can expose these two pieces of
   information by using HTTP response headers Last-Modified and Expires.

Internet-Draft        ALTO Performance Cost Metrics            July 2021


5.4.2.  Aggregation Computation Considerations

   An ALTO server may not be able to measure the performance metrics to
   be exposed.  The basic issue is that the "source" information can
   often be link level.  For example, routing protocols often measure
   and report only per link loss, not end-to-end loss; similarly,
   routing protocols report link level available bandwidth, not end-to-
   end available bandwidth.  The ALTO server then need to aggregate
   these data to provide an abstract and unified view that can be more
   useful to applications.  The server should consider that different
   metrics may use different aggregation computation.  For example, the
   end-to-end latency of a path is the sum of the latency of the links
   on the path; the end-to-end available bandwidth of a path is the
   minimum of the available bandwidth of the links on the path.

6.  Security Considerations

   The properties defined in this document present no security
   considerations beyond those in Section 15 of the base ALTO
   specification [RFC7285].

   However, concerns addressed in Sections "15.1 Authenticity and
   Integrity of ALTO Information", "15.2 Potential Undesirable Guidance
   from Authenticated ALTO Information", and "15.3 Confidentiality of
   ALTO Information" remain of utmost importance.  Indeed, TE
   performance is highly sensitive ISP information; therefore, sharing
   TE metric values in numerical mode requires full mutual confidence
   between the entities managing the ALTO server and the ALTO client.
   ALTO servers will most likely distribute numerical TE performance to
   ALTO clients under strict and formal mutual trust agreements.  On the
   other hand, ALTO clients must be cognizant on the risks attached to
   such information that they would have acquired outside formal
   conditions of mutual trust.

   To mitigate confidentiality risks during information transport of TE
   performance metrics, the operator should address the risk of ALTO
   information being leaked to malicious Clients or third parties,
   through attacks such as the man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.  As
   specified in "Protection Strategies" (Section 15.3.2 of [RFC7285]),
   the ALTO Server should authenticate ALTO Clients when transmitting an
   ALTO information resource containing sensitive TE performance
   metrics.  "Authentication and Encryption" (Section 8.3.5 of
   [RFC7285]) specifies that "ALTO Server implementations as well as
   ALTO Client implementations MUST support the "https" URI scheme of
   [RFC2818] and Transport Layer Security (TLS) of [RFC5246]".

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has created and now maintains the "ALTO Cost Metric Registry",
   listed in Section 14.2, Table 3 of [RFC7285].  This registry is
   located at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/alto-protocol/alto-
