1. Abstract

H.323 Specification [3] and H.225.0 [4] together define a system and a
set of protocols for multimedia communications services over Packet
Based Networks (PBN).   H.225.0 [4] messages define means for carrying
any standard URL (Uniform Resource Locators) in order to specify source
and destination, involved in the call. Starting from H.323v.4, H.323
URL is defined in order to specify H.323 party involved in the call.
This H323-URL definition has a form of user@host where user corresponds
to endpoint's alias and host corresponds to its domain/zone/gatekeeper
(in terms of [3]).  The purpose of this document is to register the
specified (and presented below) H.323 URL scheme within IANA. This will
allow for improved resources use and integration over the Internet.


2. Conventions used in this document


The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1].


3. URL scheme name

Taking into consideration the guidelines of RFC-2717[12], the proposal
is to register the H.323 URL scheme, named "H323", within the IETF
tree. It is despite the fact, that H.323 has been defined by ITU-T.
H.323 has been widely deployed today and is used side-by-side with
other Internet protocols and technologies. We would like to prevent the
segmentation of URL scheme definitions, belonging to the same group of
applications and running on the same Networks.


4. URL scheme formal syntax definition and character encoding

The H.323 URL is defined by H.323 [3] in ABNF exactly as shown below.
It utilizes the Core Rules specified in section 6.1 of RFC-2234 [2].

As indicated in the syntax, the user string and the hostport string are
both optional, though at least one shall be present.

The H.323 URL is not case sensitive.

H323-URL = "h323:" [ user ] [ "@" hostport ]
user				=	unreserved / escaped
hostport			=	host [":" port]
host				=	hostname / IPv4address / IPv6reference
hostname			=	*( domainlabel "." ) toplabel [ "." ]
domainlabel		=	alphanum / alphanum *( alphanum / "-" ) alphanum
toplabel			=	ALPHA / ALPHA *( alphanum / "-" ) alphanum
IPv4address		=	1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT
IPv6reference		=	"[" IPv6address "]"
IPV6address		=	hexpart [ ":" IPv4address ]
hexpart			=	hexseq / hexseq "::" [ hexseq ] / "::" [ hexseq ]
hexseq			=	hex4 *( ":" hex4)
hex4				=	1*4HEXDIG
port				=	1*DIGIT
unreserved		=	alphanum / mark
alphanum			=	ALPHA / DIGIT
mark				=	"-" / "_" / "." / "!" / "~" / "*" / "'"
				/	"(" / ")" / "&" / "=" / "+" / "$" / ","
escaped			=	"%" HEXDIG HEXDIG



5. Intended Usage

One of the alias types defined by H.323 [3] is the url-ID, which is
intended to contain standard URL schemes that may be used to reach
resources.  In addition, URLs are within Annex K/H.323 [13] and may be
used in other services added to H.323 in the future. An H.323 entity
may accept any valid URL that it understands, but should support the
H.323 URL as defined in this section.  The H.323 URL is intended to
help an entity resolve the address of another H.323 entity. It is
composed of two parts: the user and the hostport. The user specifies an
alias for the entity, such as a user or a service, without carrying
information about the location of the entity. The hostport, on the
other hand, may specify the transport address of a Gatekeeper, a
Gatekeeper Identifier, or the fully qualified domain name of the
Gatekeeper, along with an optional port number for RAS communication.


6. Applications and/or protocols, which may use this URL scheme name

H.323 URL may be carried by another protocols, such as SIP [6]. It is
feasible when the information about destination (or source) protocol
support is known as a part of its URL. For example, that would
facilitate SIP-H.323 interoperability (discussed in [7]) in more
efficient manner.


7. Security Considerations

H.323 URL definition conceptually has the same approach as already
defined and widely used other URL schemes, such as [7].  When H.323 URL
is carried within H.225.0 [4] messages the security is addressed by
H.323 Security framework [5]. When H.323 URL is carried within other
protocols (such as SIP [6]), the security is addressed within the
corresponding protocol.
