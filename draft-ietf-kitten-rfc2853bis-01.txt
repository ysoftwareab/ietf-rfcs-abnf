Abstract

   The Generic Security Services Application Program Interface (GSS-API)
   offers application programmers uniform access to security services
   atop a variety of underlying cryptographic mechanisms.  This document
   updates the Java bindings for the GSS-API that are specified in RFC
   2853 [JGSS].  This document obsoletes RFC 2853 [JGSS] by making
   specific and incremental clarifications and corrections to it in
   response to identification of transcription errors and implementation

   experience.  The only note-worthy changes are in sections 4.12.1,
   6.3.2, and 6.8.1 of RFC 2853 [JGSS], which are replaced by the
   sections 5.12.1, 7.3.2, and 7.8.1 of this document, where numerical
   constants were either added or modified.

   The GSS-API is described at a language independent conceptual level
   in RFC 2743 [GSSAPIv2-UPDATE].  The GSS-API allows a caller
   application to authenticate a principal identity, to delegate rights
   to a peer, and to apply security services such as confidentiality and
   integrity on a per-message basis.  Examples of security mechanisms
   defined for GSS-API are The Simple Public-Key GSS-API Mechanism
   [SPKM] and The Kerberos Version 5 GSS-API Mechanism [KERBV5].

Internet-Draft             Java GSS-API Update              January 2006


2.  Introduction

   This document specifies Java language bindings for the Generic
   Security Services Application Programming Interface Version 2 (GSS-
   API).  GSS-API Version 2 is described in a language independent
   format in RFC 2743 [GSSAPIv2-UPDATE].  The GSS-API allows a caller
   application to authenticate a principal identity, to delegate rights
   to a peer, and to apply security services such as confidentiality and
   integrity on a per-message basis.

   This document and its predecessor RFC 2853 [JGSS] leverage the work
   done by the WG in the area of RFC 2743 [GSSAPIv2-UPDATE] and the
   C-bindings RFC 2744 [GSSAPI-C].  Whenever appropriate, text has been
   used from the C-bindings RFC 2744 to explain generic concepts and
   provide direction to the implementors.

   The design goals of this API have been to satisfy all the
   functionality defined in RFC 2743 and to provide these services in an
   object oriented method.  The specification also aims to satisfy the
   needs of both types of Java application developers, those who would
   like access to a "system-wide" GSS-API implementation, as well as
   those who would want to provide their own "custom" implementation.

   A "system-wide" implementation is one that is available to all
   applications in the form of a library package.  It may be the
   standard package in the Java runtime environment (JRE) being used or
   it may be additionally installed and accessible to any application
   via the CLASSPATH.

   A "custom" implementation of the GSS-API, on the other hand, is one
   that would, in most cases, be bundled with the application during
   distribution.  It is expected that such an implementation would be
   meant to provide for some particular need of the application, such as
   support for some specific mechanism.

   The design of this API also aims to provide a flexible framework to
   add and manage GSS-API mechanisms.  GSS-API leverages the Java
   Cryptography Architecture (JCA) provider model to support the
   plugability of mechanisms.  Mechanisms can be added on a "system-
   wide" basis, where all users of the framework will have them
   available.  The specification also allows for the addition of
   mechanisms per-instance of the GSS-API.

   Lastly, this specification presents an API that will naturally fit
   within the operation environment of the Java platform.  Readers are
   assumed to be familiar with both the GSS-API and the Java platform.

3.  GSS-API Operational Paradigm

   The Generic Security Service Application Programming Interface
   Version 2 [GSSAPIv2-UPDATE] defines a generic security API to calling
   applications.  It allows a communicating application to authenticate
   the user associated with another application, to delegate rights to
   another application, and to apply security services such as
   confidentiality and integrity on a per-message basis.

   There are four stages to using GSS-API:

   1) The application acquires a set of credentials with which it may
   prove its identity to other processes.  The application's credentials
   vouch for its global identity, which may or may not be related to any
   local username under which it may be running.

   2) A pair of communicating applications establish a joint security
   context using their credentials.  The security context encapsulates
   shared state information, which is required in order that per-message
   security services may be provided.  Examples of state information
   that might be shared between applications as part of a security
   context are cryptographic keys, and message sequence numbers.  As
   part of the establishment of  a security context, the context
   initiator is authenticated to the responder, and may require that the
   responder is authenticated back to the initiator.  The initiator may
   optionally give the responder the right to initiate further security
   contexts, acting as an agent or delegate of the initiator.  This
   transfer of rights is termed "delegation", and is achieved by
   creating a set of credentials, similar to those used by the
   initiating application, but which may be used by the responder.

   A GSSContext object is used to establish and maintain the shared
   information that makes up the security context.  Certain GSSContext
   methods will generate a token, which applications treat as
   cryptographically protected, opaque data.  The caller of such
   GSSContext method is responsible for transferring the token to the
   peer application, encapsulated if necessary in an application-to-
   application protocol.  On receipt of such a token, the peer
   application should pass it to a corresponding GSSContext method which
   will decode the token and extract the information, updating the
   security context state information accordingly.

   3) Per-message services are invoked on a GSSContext object to apply
   either:

   integrity and data origin authentication, or

   confidentiality, integrity and data origin authentication



Upadhyay & Malkani        Expires July 31, 2006                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft             Java GSS-API Update              January 2006


   to application data, which are treated by GSS-API as arbitrary octet-
   strings.  An application transmitting a message that it wishes to
   protect will call the appropriate GSSContext method (getMIC or wrap)
   to apply protection, and send the resulting token to the receiving
   application.  The receiver will pass the received token (and, in the
   case of data protected by getMIC, the accompanying message-data) to
   the corresponding decoding method of the GSSContext interface
   (verifyMIC or unwrap) to remove the protection and validate the data.

   4) At the completion of a communications session (which may extend
   across several transport connections), each application uses a
   GSSContext method to invalidate the security context and release any
   system or cryptographic resources held.  Multiple contexts may also
   be used (either successively or simultaneously) within a single
   communications association, at the discretion of the applications.

4.  Additional Controls

   This section discusses the optional services that a context initiator
   may request of the GSS-API before the context establishment.  Each of
   these services is requested by calling the appropriate mutator method
   in the GSSContext object before the first call to init is performed.
   Only the context initiator can request context flags.

   The optional services defined are:

      Delegation The (usually temporary) transfer of rights from
      initiator to acceptor, enabling the acceptor to authenticate
      itself as an agent of the initiator.

      Mutual Authentication In addition to the initiator authenticating
      its identity to the context acceptor, the context acceptor should
      also authenticate itself to the initiator.

      Replay Detection In addition to providing message integrity
      services, GSSContext per-message operations of getMIC and wrap
      should include message numbering information  to enable verifyMIC
      and unwrap to detect if a message has been duplicated.

      Out-of-Sequence Detection In addition to providing message
      integrity services, GSSContext per-message operations  (getMIC and
      wrap) should include message sequencing information to enable
      verifyMIC and unwrap to detect if a message has been received out
      of sequence.

      Anonymous Authentication The establishment of the security context
      should not reveal the initiator's identity to the context
      acceptor.

   Some mechanisms may not support all optional services, and some
   mechanisms may only support some services in conjunction with others.
   The GSSContext interface offers query methods to allow the
   verification by the calling application of which services will be
   available from the context when the establishment phase is complete.
   In general, if the security mechanism is capable of providing a
   requested service, it should do so even if additional services must
   be enabled in order to provide the requested service.  If the
   mechanism is incapable of providing a requested service, it should
   proceed without the service leaving the application to abort the
   context establishment process if it considers the requested service
   to be mandatory.

   Some mechanisms may specify that support for some services is
   optional, and that implementors of the mechanism need not provide it.

Internet-Draft             Java GSS-API Update              January 2006


   This is most commonly true of the confidentiality service, often
   because of legal restrictions on the use of data-encryption, but may
   apply to any of the services.  Such mechanisms are required to send
   at least one token from acceptor to initiator during context
   establishment when the initiator indicates a desire to use such a
   service, so that the initiating GSS-API can correctly indicate
   whether the service is supported by the acceptor's GSS-API.

4.1  Delegation

   The GSS-API allows delegation to be controlled by the initiating
   application via the requestCredDeleg method before the first call to
   init has been issued.  Some mechanisms do not support delegation, and
   for such mechanisms attempts by an application to enable delegation
   are ignored.

   The acceptor of a security context, for which the initiator enabled
   delegation, can check if delegation was enabled by using the
   getCredDelegState method of the GSSContext interface.  In cases when
   it is, the delegated credential object can be obtained by calling the
   getDelegCred method.  The obtained GSSCredential object may then be
   used to initiate subsequent GSS-API security contexts as an agent or
   delegate of the initiator.  If the original initiator's identity is
   "A" and the delegate's identity is "B", then, depending on the
   underlying mechanism, the identity embodied by the delegated
   credential may be either "A" or "B acting for A".

   For many mechanisms that support delegation, a simple boolean does
   not provide enough control.  Examples of additional aspects of
   delegation control that a mechanism might provide to an application
   are duration of delegation, network addresses from which delegation
   is valid, and constraints on the tasks that may be performed by a
   delegate.  Such controls are presently outside the scope of the GSS-
   API.  GSS-API implementations supporting mechanisms offering
   additional controls should provide extension routines that allow
   these controls to be exercised (perhaps by modifying the initiator's
   GSS-API credential object prior to its use in establishing a
   context).  However, the simple delegation control provided by GSS-API
   should always be able to over-ride other mechanism-specific
   delegation controls.  If the application instructs the GSSContext
   object that delegation is not desired, then the implementation must
   not permit delegation to occur.  This is an exception to the general
   rule that a mechanism may enable services even if they are not
   requested - delegation may only be provided at the explicit request
   of the application.

4.2  Mutual Authentication

   Usually, a context acceptor will require that a context initiator
   authenticate itself so that the acceptor may make an access-control
   decision prior to performing a service for the initiator.  In some
   cases, the initiator may also request that the acceptor authenticate
   itself.  GSS-API allows the initiating application to request this
   mutual authentication service by calling the requestMutualAuth method
   of the GSSContext interface with a "true" parameter before making the
   first call to init.  The initiating application is informed as to
   whether or not the context acceptor has authenticated itself.  Note
   that some mechanisms may not support mutual authentication, and other
   mechanisms may always perform mutual authentication, whether or not
   the initiating application requests it.  In particular, mutual
   authentication may be required by some mechanisms in order to support
   replay or out-of-sequence message detection, and for such mechanisms
   a request for either of these services will automatically enable
   mutual authentication.

4.3  Replay and Out-of-Sequence Detection

   The GSS-API may provide detection of mis-ordered messages once a
   security context has been established.  Protection may be applied to
   messages by either application, by calling either getMIC or wrap
   methods of the GSSContext interface, and verified by the peer
   application by calling verifyMIC or unwrap for the peer's GSSContext
   object.

   The getMIC method calculates a cryptographic checksum of an
   application message, and returns that checksum in a token.  The
   application should pass both the token and the message to the peer
   application, which presents them to the verifyMIC method of the
   peer's GSSContext object.

   The wrap method calculates a cryptographic checksum of an application
   message, and places both the checksum and the message inside a single
   token.  The application should pass the token to the peer
   application, which presents it to the unwrap method of the peer's
   GSSContext object to extract the message and verify the checksum.

   Either pair of routines may be capable of detecting out-of-sequence
   message delivery, or duplication of messages.  Details of such mis-
   ordered messages are indicated through supplementary query methods of
   the MessageProp object that is filled in by each of these routines.

   A mechanism need not maintain a list of all tokens that have been
   processed in order to support these status codes.  A typical
   mechanism might retain information about only the most recent "N"



Upadhyay & Malkani        Expires July 31, 2006                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft             Java GSS-API Update              January 2006


   tokens processed, allowing it to distinguish duplicates and missing
   tokens within the most recent "N" messages; the receipt of a token
   older than the most recent "N" would result in the isOldToken method
   of the instance of MessageProp to return "true".

4.4  Anonymous Authentication

   In certain situations, an application may wish to initiate the
   authentication process to authenticate a peer, without revealing its
   own identity.  As an example, consider an application providing
   access to a database containing medical information, and offering
   unrestricted access to the service.  A client of such a service might
   wish to authenticate the service (in order to establish trust in any
   information retrieved from it), but might not wish the service to be
   able to obtain the client's identity (perhaps due to privacy concerns
   about the specific inquiries, or perhaps simply to avoid being placed
   on mailing-lists).

   In normal use of the GSS-API, the initiator's identity is made
   available to the acceptor as a result of the context establishment
   process.  However, context initiators may request that their identity
   not be revealed to the context acceptor.  Many mechanisms do not
   support anonymous authentication, and for such mechanisms the request
   will not be honored.  An authentication token will still be
   generated, but the application is always informed if a requested
   service is unavailable, and has the option to abort context
   establishment if anonymity is valued above the other security
   services that would require a context to be established.

   In addition to informing the application that a context is
   established anonymously (via the isAnonymous method of the GSSContext
   class), the getSrcName method of the acceptor's GSSContext object
   will, for such contexts, return a reserved internal-form name,
   defined by the implementation.

   The toString method for a GSSName object representing an anonymous
   entity will return a printable name.  The returned value will be
   syntactically distinguishable from any valid principal name supported
   by the implementation.  The associated name-type object identifier
   will be an oid representing the value of NT_ANONYMOUS.  This name-
   type oid will be defined as a public, static Oid object of the
   GSSName class.  The printable form of an anonymous name should be
   chosen such that it implies anonymity, since this name may appear in,
   for example, audit logs.  For example, the string "<anonymous>" might
   be a good choice, if no valid printable names supported by the
   implementation can begin with "<" and end with ">".

   When using the equal method of the GSSName interface, and one of the



Upadhyay & Malkani        Expires July 31, 2006                [Page 13]

   operands is a GSSName instance representing an anonymous entity, the
   method must return "false".

4.5  Confidentiality

   If a GSSContext supports the confidentiality service, wrap method may
   be used to encrypt application messages.  Messages are selectively
   encrypted, under the control of the setPrivacy method of the
   MessageProp object used in the wrap method.

4.6  Inter-process Context Transfer

   GSS-API V2 provides functionality which allows a security context to
   be transferred between processes on a single machine.  These are
   implemented using the export method of GSSContext and a byte array
   constructor of the same class.  The most common use for such a
   feature is a client-server design where the server is implemented as
   a single process that accepts incoming security contexts, which then
   launches child processes to deal with the data on these contexts.  In
   such a design, the child processes must have access to the security
   context object created within the parent so that they can use per-
   message protection services and delete the security context when the
   communication session ends.

   Since the security context data structure is expected to contain
   sequencing information, it is impractical in general to share a
   context between processes.  Thus GSSContext interface provides an
   export method that the process, which currently owns the context, can
   call to declare that it has no intention to use the context
   subsequently, and to create an inter-process token containing
   information needed by the adopting process to successfully re-create
   the context.  After successful completion of export, the original
   security context is made inaccessible to the calling process by GSS-
   API and any further usage of this object will result in failures.
   The originating process transfers the inter-process token to the
   adopting process, which creates a new GSSContext object using the
   byte array constructor.  The properties of the context are equivalent
   to that of the original context.

   The inter-process token may contain sensitive data from the original
   security context (including cryptographic keys).  Applications using
   inter-process tokens to transfer security contexts must take
   appropriate steps to protect these tokens in transit.

   Implementations are not required to support the inter-process
   transfer of security contexts.  Calling the isTransferable method of
   the GSSContext interface will indicate if the context object is
   transferable.

4.7  The Use of Incomplete Contexts

   Some mechanisms may allow the per-message services to be used before
   the context establishment process is complete.  For example, a
   mechanism may include sufficient information in its initial context-
   level tokens for the context acceptor to immediately decode messages
   protected with wrap or getMIC.  For such a mechanism, the initiating
   application need not wait until subsequent context-level tokens have
   been sent and received before invoking the per-message protection
   services.

   An application can invoke the isProtReady method of the GSSContext
   class to determine if the per-message services are available in
   advance of complete context establishment.  Applications wishing to
   use per-message protection services on partially-established contexts
   should query this method before attempting to invoke wrap or getMIC.

5.  Calling Conventions

   Java provides the implementors with not just a syntax for the
   language, but also an operational environment.  For example, memory
   is automatically managed and does not require application
   intervention.  These language features have allowed for a simpler API
   and have led to the elimination of certain GSS-API functions.

   Moreover, the JCA defines a provider model which allows for
   implementation independent access to security services.  Using this
   model, applications can seamlessly switch between different
   implementations and dynamically add new services.  The GSS-API
   specification leverages these concepts by the usage of providers for
   the mechanism implementations.

5.1  Package Name

   The classes and interfaces defined in this document reside in the
   package called "org.ietf.jgss".  Applications that wish to make use
   of this API should import this package name as shown in section 8.

5.2  Provider Framework

   The Java security API's use a provider architecture that allows
   applications to be implementation independent and security API
   implementations to be modular and extensible.  The
   java.security.Provider class is an abstract class that a vendor
   extends.  This class maps various properties that represent different
   security services that are available to the names of the actual
   vendor classes that implement those services.  When requesting a
   service, an application simply specifies the desired provider and the
   API delegates the request to service classes available from that
   provider.

   Using the Java security provider model insulates applications from
   implementation details of the services they wish to use.
   Applications can switch between providers easily and new providers
   can be added as needed, even at runtime.

   The GSS-API may use providers to find components for specific
   underlying security mechanisms.  For instance, a particular provider
   might contain components that will allow the GSS-API to support the
   Kerberos v5 mechanism and another might contain components to support
   the SPKM mechanism.  By delegating mechanism specific functionality
   to the components obtained from providers the GSS-API can be extended
   to support an arbitrary list of mechanism.

   How the GSS-API locates and queries these providers is beyond the

Internet-Draft             Java GSS-API Update              January 2006


   scope of this document and is being deferred to a Service Provider
   Interface (SPI) specification.  The availability of such a SPI
   specification is not mandatory for the adoption of this API
   specification nor is it mandatory to use providers in the
   implementation of a GSS-API framework.  However, by using the
   provider framework together with an SPI specification one can create
   an extensible and implementation independent GSS-API framework.

5.3  Integer Types

   All numeric values are declared as "int" primitive Java type.  The
   Java specification guarantees that this will be a 32 bit two's
   complement signed number.

   Throughout this API, the "boolean" primitive Java type is used
   wherever a boolean value is required or returned.

5.4  Opaque Data Types

   Java byte arrays are used to represent opaque data types which are
   consumed and produced by the GSS-API in the forms of tokens.  Java
   arrays contain a length field which enables the users to easily
   determine their size.  The language has automatic garbage collection
   which alleviates the need by developers to release memory and
   simplifies buffer ownership issues.

5.5  Strings

   The String object will be used to represent all textual data.  The
   Java String object, transparently treats all characters as two-byte
   Unicode characters which allows support for many locals.  All
   routines returning or accepting textual data will use the String
   object.

5.6  Object Identifiers

   An Oid object will be used to represent Universal Object Identifiers
   (Oids).  Oids are ISO-defined, hierarchically globally-interpretable
   identifiers used within the GSS-API framework to identify security
   mechanisms and name formats.  The Oid object can be created from a
   string representation of its dot notation (e.g. "1.3.6.1.5.6.2") as
   well as from its ASN.1 DER encoding.  Methods are also provided to
   test equality and provide the DER representation for the object.

   An important feature of the Oid class is that its instances are
   immutable - i.e. there are no methods defined that allow one to
   change the contents of an Oid. This property allows one to treat
   these objects as "statics" without the need to perform copies.



Upadhyay & Malkani        Expires July 31, 2006                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft             Java GSS-API Update              January 2006


   Certain routines allow the usage of a default oid.  A "null" value
   can be used in those cases.

5.7  Object Identifier Sets

   The Java bindings represents object identifiers sets as arrays of Oid
   objects.  All Java arrays contain a length field which allows for
   easy manipulation and reference.

   In order to support the full functionality of RFC 2743, the Oid class
   includes a method which checks for existence of an Oid object within
   a specified array.  This is equivalent in functionality to
   gss_test_oid_set_member.  The use of Java arrays and Java's automatic
   garbage collection has eliminated the need for the following
   routines: gss_create_empty_oid_set, gss_release_oid_set, and
   gss_add_oid_set_member.  Java GSS-API implementations will not
   contain them.  Java's automatic garbage collection and the immutable
   property of the Oid object eliminates the complicated memory

5.8  Credentials

   GSS-API credentials are represented by the GSSCredential interface.
   The interface contains several constructs to allow for the creation
   of most common credential objects for the initiator and the acceptor.
   Comparisons are performed using the interface's "equals" method.  The
   following general description of GSS-API credentials is included from
   the C-bindings specification:

   GSS-API credentials can contain mechanism-specific principal
   authentication data for multiple mechanisms.  A GSS-API credential is
   composed of a set of credential-elements, each of which is applicable
   to a single mechanism.  A credential may contain at most one
   credential-element for each supported mechanism.  A credential-
   element identifies the data needed by a single mechanism to
   authenticate a single principal, and conceptually contains two
   credential-references that describe the actual mechanism-specific
   authentication data, one to be used by GSS-API for initiating
   contexts, and one to be used for accepting contexts.  For mechanisms
   that do not distinguish between acceptor and initiator credentials,
   both references would point to the same underlying mechanism-specific
   authentication data.

   Credentials describe a set of mechanism-specific principals, and give

Internet-Draft             Java GSS-API Update              January 2006


   their holder the ability to act as any of those principals.  All
   principal identities asserted by a single GSS-API credential should
   belong to the same entity, although enforcement of this property is
   an implementation-specific matter.  A single GSSCredential object
   represents all the credential elements that have been acquired.

   The creation's of an GSSContext object allows the value of "null" to
   be specified as the GSSCredential input parameter.  This will
   indicate a desire by the application to act as a default principal.
   While individual GSS-API implementations are free to determine such
   default behavior as appropriate to the mechanism, the following
   default behavior by these routines is recommended for portability:

   For the initiator side of the context:

   1) If there is only a single principal capable of initiating security
   contexts for the chosen mechanism that the application is authorized
   to act on behalf of, then that principal shall be used, otherwise

   2) If the platform maintains a concept of a default network- identity
   for the chosen mechanism, and if the application is authorized to act
   on behalf of that identity for the purpose of initiating security
   contexts, then the principal corresponding to that identity shall be
   used, otherwise

   3) If the platform maintains a concept of a default local identity,
   and provides a means to map local identities into network-identities
   for the chosen mechanism, and if the application is authorized to act
   on behalf of the network- identity image of the default local
   identity for the purpose of initiating security contexts using the
   chosen mechanism, then the principal corresponding to that identity
   shall be used, otherwise

   4) A user-configurable default identity should be used.

   and for the acceptor side of the context

   1) If there is only a single authorized principal identity capable of
   accepting security contexts for the chosen mechanism, then that
   principal shall be used, otherwise

   2) If the mechanism can determine the identity of the target
   principal by examining the context-establishment token processed
   during the accept method, and if the accepting application is
   authorized to act as that principal for the purpose of accepting
   security contexts using the chosen mechanism, then that principal
   identity shall be used, otherwise

Internet-Draft             Java GSS-API Update              January 2006


   3) If the mechanism supports context acceptance by any principal, and
   if mutual authentication was not requested, any principal that the
   application is authorized to accept security contexts under using the
   chosen mechanism may be used, otherwise

   4) A user-configurable default identity shall be used.

   The purpose of the above rules is to allow security contexts to be
   established by both initiator and acceptor using the default behavior
   whenever possible.  Applications requesting default behavior are
   likely to be more portable across mechanisms and implementations than
   ones that instantiate an GSSCredential object representing a specific
   identity.

5.9  Contexts

   The GSSContext interface is used to represent one end of a GSS-API
   security context, storing state information appropriate to that end
   of the peer communication, including cryptographic state information.
   The instantiation of the context object is done differently by the
   initiator and the acceptor.  After the context has been instantiated,
   the initiator may choose to set various context options which will
   determine the characteristics of the desired security context.  When
   all the application desired characteristics have been set, the
   initiator will call the initSecContext method which will produce a
   token for consumption by the peer's acceptSecContext method.  It is
   the responsibility of the application to deliver the authentication
   token(s) between the peer applications for processing.  Upon
   completion of the context establishment phase, context attributes can
   be retrieved, by both the initiator and acceptor, using the accessor
   methods.  These will reflect the actual attributes of the established
   context.  At this point the context can be used by the application to
   apply cryptographic services to its data.

5.10  Authentication Tokens

   A token is a caller-opaque type that GSS-API uses to maintain
   synchronization between each end of the GSS-API security context.
   The token is a cryptographically protected octet-string, generated by
   the underlying mechanism at one end of a GSS-API security context for
   use by the peer mechanism at the other end.  Encapsulation (if
   required) within the application protocol and transfer of the token
   are the responsibility of the peer applications.

   Java GSS-API uses byte arrays to represent authentication tokens.
   Overloaded methods exist which allow the caller to supply input and
   output streams which will be used for the reading and writing of the
   token data.

Internet-Draft             Java GSS-API Update              January 2006


5.11  Interprocess Tokens

   Certain GSS-API routines are intended to transfer data between
   processes in multi-process programs.  These routines use a caller-
   opaque octet-string, generated by the GSS-API in one process for use
   by the GSS-API in another process.  The calling application is
   responsible for transferring such tokens between processes.  Note
   that, while GSS-API implementors are encouraged to avoid placing
   sensitive information within interprocess tokens, or to
   cryptographically protect them, many implementations will be unable
   to avoid placing key material or other sensitive data within them.
   It is the application's responsibility to ensure that interprocess
   tokens are protected in transit, and transferred only to processes
   that are trustworthy.  An interprocess token is represented using a
   byte array emitted from the export method of the GSSContext
   interface.  The receiver of the interprocess token would initialize
   an GSSContext object with this token to create a new context.  Once a
   context has been exported, the GSSContext object is invalidated and
   is no longer available.

5.12  Error Reporting

   RFC 2743 defined the usage of major and minor status values for
   signaling of GSS-API errors.  The major code, also called GSS status
   code, is used to signal errors at the GSS-API level independent of
   the underlying mechanism(s).  The minor status value or Mechanism
   status code, is a mechanism defined error value indicating a
   mechanism specific error code.

   Java GSS-API uses exceptions implemented by the GSSException class to
   signal both minor and major error values.  Both mechanism specific
   errors and GSS-API level errors are signaled through instances of
   this class.  The usage of exceptions replaces the need for major and
   minor codes to be used within the API calls.  GSSException class also
   contains methods to obtain textual representations for both the major
   and minor values, which is equivalent to the functionality of
   gss_display_status.

5.12.1  GSS Status Codes

   GSS status codes indicate errors that are independent of the
   underlying mechanism(s) used to provide the security service.  The
   errors that can be indicated via a GSS status code are generic API
   routine errors (errors that are defined in the GSS-API
   specification).  These bindings take advantage of the Java exceptions
   mechanism, thus eliminating the need for calling errors.

   A GSS status code indicates a single fatal generic API error from the

Internet-Draft             Java GSS-API Update              January 2006


   routine that has thrown the GSSException.  Using exceptions announces
   that a fatal error has occurred during the execution of the method.
   The GSS-API operational model also allows for the signaling of
   supplementary status information from the per-message calls.  These
   need to be handled as return values since using exceptions is not
   appropriate for informatory or warning-like information.  The methods
   that are capable of producing supplementary information are the two
   per-message methods GSSContext.verifyMIC() and GSSContext.unwrap().
   These methods fill the supplementary status codes in the MessageProp
   object that was passed in.

   A GSSException object, along with providing the functionality for
   setting of the various error codes and translating them into textual
   representation, also contains the definitions of all the numeric
   error values.  The following table lists the definitions of error
   codes:

   provide more details about the error.

   The different major status codes that can be contained in the
   GSSException object thrown by the methods in this specification are
   the same as the major status codes returned by the corresponding
   calls in RFC 2743 [GSSAPIv2-UPDATE].

5.12.2  Mechanism-Specific Status Codes

   Mechanism-specific status codes are communicated in two ways, they
   are part of any GSSException thrown from the mechanism specific layer
   to signal a fatal error, or they are part of the MessageProp object
   that the per-message calls use to signal non-fatal errors.

   A default value of 0 in either the GSSException object or the
   MessageProp object will be used to represent the absence of any
   mechanism specific status code.

5.12.3  Supplementary Status Codes

   Supplementary status codes are confined to the per-message methods of
   the GSSContext interface.  Because of the informative nature of these
   errors it is not appropriate to use exceptions to signal them.
   Instead, the per-message operations of the GSSContext interface
   return these values in a MessageProp object.

   The MessageProp class defines query methods which return boolean
   values indicating the following supplementary states:

         Table: Supplementary Status Methods

         Method Name        Meaning when "true" is returned

         isDuplicateToken   The token was a duplicate of an
                            earlier token.

         isOldToken         The token's validity period has
                            expired.

         isUnseqToken       A later token has already been
                            processed.

         isGapToken         An expected per-message token was
                            not received.

   "true" return value for any of the above methods indicates that the
   token exhibited the specified property.  The application must
   determine the appropriate course of action for these supplementary

   values.  They are not treated as errors by the GSS-API.

5.13  Names

   A name is used to identify a person or entity.  GSS-API authenticates
   the relationship between a name and the entity claiming the name.

   Since different authentication mechanisms may employ different
   namespaces for identifying their principals, GSS-API's naming support
   is necessarily complex in multi-mechanism environments (or even in
   some single-mechanism environments where the underlying mechanism
   supports multiple namespaces).

   Two distinct conceptual representations are defined for names:

   1) A GSS-API form represented by implementations of the GSSName
   interface: A single GSSName object may contain multiple names from
   different namespaces, but all names should refer to the same entity.
   An example of such an internal name would be the name returned from a
   call to the getName method of the GSSCredential interface, when
   applied to a credential containing credential elements for multiple
   authentication mechanisms employing different namespaces.  This
   GSSName object will contain a distinct name for the entity for each
   authentication mechanism.

   For GSS-API implementations supporting multiple namespaces, GSSName
   implementations must contain sufficient information to determine the
   namespace to which each primitive name belongs.

   2) Mechanism-specific contiguous byte array and string forms:
   Different GSSName initialization methods are provided to handle both
   byte array and string formats and to accommodate various calling
   applications and name types.  These formats are capable of containing
   only a single name (from a single namespace).  Contiguous string
   names are always accompanied by an object identifier specifying the
   namespace to which the name belongs, and their format is dependent on
   the authentication mechanism that employs that name.  The string name
   forms are assumed to be printable, and may therefore be used by GSS-
   API applications for communication with their users.  The byte array
   name formats are assumed to be in non-printable formats (e.g. the
   byte array returned from the export method of the GSSName interface).

   A GSSName object can be converted to a contiguous representation by
   using the toString method.  This will guarantee that the name will be
   converted to a printable format.  Different initialization methods in
   the GSSName interface are defined allowing support for multiple
   syntaxes for each supported namespace, and allowing users the freedom
   to choose a preferred name representation.  The toString method



Upadhyay & Malkani        Expires July 31, 2006                [Page 25]

Internet-Draft             Java GSS-API Update              January 2006


   should use an implementation-chosen printable syntax for each
   supported name-type.  To obtain the printable name type,
   getStringNameType method can be used.

   There is no guarantee that calling the toString method on the GSSName
   interface will produce the same string form as the original imported
   string name.  Furthermore, it is possible that the name was not even
   constructed from a string representation.  The same applies to name-
   space identifiers which may not necessarily survive unchanged after a
   journey through the internal name-form.  An example of this might be
   a mechanism that authenticates X.500 names, but provides an
   algorithmic mapping of Internet DNS names into X.500.  That
   mechanism's implementation of GSSName might, when presented with a
   DNS name, generate an internal name that contained both the original
   DNS name and the equivalent X.500 name.  Alternatively, it might only
   store the X.500 name.  In the latter case, the toString method of
   GSSName would most likely generate a printable X.500 name, rather
   than the original DNS name.

   The context acceptor can obtain a GSSName object representing the
   entity performing the context initiation (through the usage of
   getSrcName method).  Since this name has been authenticated by a
   single mechanism, it contains only a single name (even if the
   internal name presented by the context initiator to the GSSContext
   object had multiple components).  Such names are termed internal
   mechanism names, or "MN"s and the names emitted by GSSContext
   interface in the getSrcName and getTargName are always of this type.
   Since some applications may require MNs without wanting to incur the
   overhead of an authentication operation, creation methods are
   provided that take not only the name buffer and name type, but also
   the mechanism oid for which this name should be created.  When
   dealing with an existing GSSName object, the canonicalize method may
   be invoked to convert a general internal name into an MN.

   GSSName objects can be compared using their equal method, which
   returns "true" if the two names being compared refer to the same
   entity.  This is the preferred way to perform name comparisons
   instead of using the printable names that a given GSS-API
   implementation may support.  Since GSS-API assumes that all primitive
   names contained within a given internal name refer to the same
   entity, equal can return "true" if the two names have at least one
   primitive name in common.  If the implementation embodies knowledge
   of equivalence relationships between names taken from different
   namespaces, this knowledge may also allow successful comparisons of
   internal names containing no overlapping primitive elements.

   When used in large access control lists, the overhead of creating an
   GSSName object on each name and invoking the equal method on each



Upadhyay & Malkani        Expires July 31, 2006                [Page 26]

Internet-Draft             Java GSS-API Update              January 2006


   name from the ACL may be prohibitive.  As an alternative way of
   supporting this case, GSS-API defines a special form of the
   contiguous byte array name which may be compared directly (byte by
   byte).  Contiguous names suitable for comparison are generated by the
   export method.  Exported names may be re-imported by using the byte
   array constructor and specifying the NT_EXPORT_NAME as the name type
   object identifier.  The resulting GSSName name will also be a MN.
   The GSSName interface defines public static Oid objects representing
   the standard name types.  Structurally, an exported name object
   consists of a header containing an OID identifying the mechanism that
   authenticated the name, and a trailer containing the name itself,
   where the syntax of the trailer is defined by the individual
   mechanism specification.  Detailed description of the format is
   specified in the language-independent GSS-API specification
   [GSSAPIv2-UPDATE].

   Note that the results obtained by using the equals method will in
   general be different from those obtained by invoking canonicalize and
   export, and then comparing the byte array output.  The first series
   of operation determines whether two (unauthenticated) names identify
   the same principal; the second whether a particular mechanism would
   authenticate them as the same principal.  These two operations will
   in general give the same results only for MNs.

   It is important to note that the above are guidelines as how GSSName
   implementations should behave, and are not intended to be specific
   requirements of how names objects must be implemented.  The mechanism
   designers are free to decide on the details of their implementations
   of the GSSName interface as long as the behavior satisfies the above
   guidelines.

5.14  Channel Bindings

   GSS-API supports the use of user-specified tags to identify a given
   context to the peer application.  These tags are intended to be used
   to identify the particular communications channel that carries the
   context.  Channel bindings are communicated to the GSS-API using the
   ChannelBinding object.  The application may use byte arrays to
   specify the application data to be used in the channel binding as
   well as using instances of the InetAddress.  The InetAddress for the
   initiator and/or acceptor can be used within an instance of a
   ChannelBinding.  ChannelBinding can be set for the GSSContext object
   using the setChannelBinding method before the first call to init or
   accept has been performed.  Unless the setChannelBinding method has
   been used to set the ChannelBinding for a GSSContext object, "null"
   ChannelBinding will be assumed.  InetAddress is currently the only
   address type defined within the Java platform and as such, it is the
   only one supported within the ChannelBinding class.  Applications

   that use other types of addresses can include them as part of the
   application specific data.

   Conceptually, the GSS-API concatenates the initiator and acceptor
   address information, and the application supplied byte array to form
   an octet string.  The mechanism calculates a MIC over this octet
   string and binds the MIC to the context establishment token emitted
   by init method of the GSSContext interface.  The same bindings are
   set by the context acceptor for its GSSContext object and during
   processing of the accept method a MIC is calculated in the same way.
   The calculated MIC is compared with that found in the token, and if
   the MICs differ, accept will throw a GSSException with the  major
   code set to BAD_BINDINGS, and the context will not be established.
   Some mechanisms may include the actual channel binding data in the
   token (rather than just a MIC); applications should therefore not use
   confidential data as channel-binding components.

   Individual mechanisms may impose additional constraints on addresses
   that may appear in channel bindings.  For example, a mechanism may
   verify that the initiator address field of the channel binding
   contains the correct network address of the host system.  Portable
   applications should therefore ensure that they either provide correct
   information for the address fields, or omit setting of the addressing
   information.

5.15  Stream Objects

   The context object provides overloaded methods which use input and
   output streams as the means to convey authentication and per-message
   GSS-API tokens.  It is important to note that the streams are
   expected to contain the usual GSS-API tokens which would otherwise be
   handled through the usage of byte arrays.  The tokens are expected to
   have a definite start and an end.  The callers are responsible for
   ensuring that the supplied streams will not block, or expect to block
   until a full token is processed by the GSS-API method.  Only a single
   GSS-API token will be processed per invocation of the stream based
   method.

   The usage of streams allows the callers to have control and
   management of the supplied buffers.  Because streams are non-
   primitive objects, the callers can make the streams as complicated or
   as simple as desired simply by using the streams defined in the
   java.io package or creating their own through the use of inheritance.
   This will allow for the application's greatest flexibility.

5.16  Optional Parameters

   Whenever the application wishes to omit an optional parameter the

6.  Introduction to GSS-API Classes and Interfaces

   This section presents a brief description of the classes and
   interfaces that constitute the GSS-API.  The implementations of these
   are obtained from the CLASSPATH defined by the application.  If Java
   GSS becomes part of the standard Java API's then these classes will
   be available by default on all systems as part of the JRE's system
   classes.

   This section also shows the corresponding RFC 2743 functionality
   implemented by each of the classes.  Detailed description of these
   classes and their methods is presented in section 7.

6.1  GSSManager class

   This abstract class serves as a factory to instantiate
   implementations of the GSS-API interfaces and also provides methods
   to make queries about underlying security mechanisms.

   A default implementation can be obtained using the static method
   getInstance().  Applications that desire to provide their own
   implementation of the GSSManager class can simply extend the abstract
   class themselves.

   This class contains equivalents of the following RFC 2743 routines:


      gss_import_name              Create an internal name from  7.1.6-
                                   the supplied information.     7.1.9

      gss_acquire_cred             Acquire credential            7.1.10-
                                   for use.                      7.1.12

      gss_import_sec_context       Create a previously exported  7.1.15
                                   context.

      gss_indicate_mechs           List the mechanisms           7.1.3
                                   supported by this GSS-API
                                   implementation.

      gss_inquire_mechs_for_name   List the mechanisms           7.1.5
                                   supporting the
                                   specified name type.

      gss_inquire_names_for_mech   List the name types           7.1.4
                                   supported by the
                                   specified mechanism.

6.2  GSSName interface

   GSS-API names are represented in the Java bindings through the
   GSSName interface.  Different name formats and their definitions are
   identified with universal Object Identifiers (oids).  The format of
   the names can be derived based on the unique oid of each name type.
   The following GSS-API routines are provided by the GSSName interface:

   RFC 2743 Routine                 Function               Section(s)


      gss_display_name        Covert internal name             7.2.7
                              representation to text format.

      gss_compare_name        Compare two internal names.      7.2.3,
                                                               7.2.4

      gss_release_name        Release resources associated     N/A
                              with the internal name.

      gss_canonicalize_name   Convert an internal name to a    7.2.5
                              mechanism name.

      gss_export_name         Convert a mechanism name to      7.2.6
                              export format.

      gss_duplicate_name      Create a copy of the internal    N/A
                              name.

                                 Figure 4

   The gss_release_name call is not provided as Java does its own
   garbage collection.  The gss_duplicate_name call is also redundant;
   the GSSName interface has no mutator methods that can change the
   state of the object so it is safe for sharing.

6.3  GSSCredential interface

   The GSSCredential interface is responsible for the encapsulation of
   GSS-API credentials.  Credentials identify a single entity and
   provide the necessary cryptographic information to enable the
   creation of a context on behalf of that entity.  A single credential
   may contain multiple mechanism specific credentials, each referred to
   as a credential element.  The GSSCredential interface provides the
   functionality of the following GSS-API routines:

                                 incrementally.

      gss_inquire_cred           Obtain information about      7.3.4-
                                 credential.                   7.3.11

      gss_inquire_cred_by_mech   Obtain per-mechanism          7.3.5-
                                 information about             7.3.10
                                 a credential.

      gss_release_cred           Disposes of credentials       7.3.3
                                 after use.

6.4  GSSContext interface

   This interface encapsulates the functionality of context-level calls
   required for security context establishment and management between
   peers as well as the per-message services offered to applications.  A
   context is established between a pair of peers and allows the usage
   of security services on a per-message basis on application data.  It
   is created over a single security mechanism.  The GSSContext
   interface provides the functionality of the following GSS-API
   routines:

   does offer the functionality of destroying the locally-stored context
   information.

6.5  MessageProp class

   This helper class is used in the per-message operations on the
   context.  An instance of this class is created by the application and
   then passed into the per-message calls.  In some cases, the
   application conveys information to the GSS-API implementation through
   this object and in other cases the GSS-API returns information to the
   application by setting it in this object.  See the description of the
   per-message operations wrap, unwrap, getMIC, and verifyMIC in the
   GSSContext interfaces for details.

6.6  GSSException class

   Exceptions are used in the Java bindings to signal fatal errors to
   the calling applications.  This replaces the major and minor codes
   used in the C-bindings specification as a method of signaling
   failures.  The GSSException class handles both minor and major codes,
   as well as their translation into textual representation.  All GSS-
   API methods are declared as throwing this exception.

   and their associated operations.  GSS-API uses object identifiers to
   distinguish between security mechanisms and name types.  This class,

   implements the following GSS-API functionality:

6.8  ChannelBinding class

   An instance of this class is used to specify channel binding
   information to the GSSContext object before the start of a security
   context establishment.  The application may use a byte array to
   specify application data to be used in the channel binding as well as
   use instances of the InetAddress.  InetAddress is currently the only
   address type defined within the Java platform and as such, it is the
   only one supported within the ChannelBinding class.  Applications
   that use other types of addresses can include them as part of the
   application data.

7.  Detailed GSS-API Class Description

   This section lists a detailed description of all the public methods
   that each of the GSS-API classes and interfaces must provide.

7.1  public abstract class GSSManager

   The GSSManager class is an abstract class that serves as a factory
   for three GSS interfaces: GSSName, GSSCredential, and GSSContext.  It
   also provides methods for applications to determine what mechanisms
   are available from the GSS implementation and what nametypes these
   mechanisms support.  An instance of the default GSSManager subclass
   may be obtained through the static method getInstance(), but
   applications are free to instantiate other subclasses of GSSManager.

   All but one method in this class are declared abstract.  This means
   that subclasses have to provide the complete implementation for those
   methods.  The only exception to this is the static method
   getInstance() which will have platform specific code to return an
   instance of the default subclass.

   Platform providers of GSS are required not to add any constructors to
   this class, private, public, or protected.  This will ensure that all
   subclasses invoke only the default constructor provided to the base
   class by the compiler.

   A subclass extending the GSSManager abstract class may be implemented
   as a modular provider based layer that utilizes some well known
   service provider specification.  The GSSManager API provides the
   application with methods to set provider preferences on such an
   implementation.  These methods also allow the implementation to throw
   a well-defined exception in case provider based configuration is not
   supported.  Applications that expect to be portable should be aware
   of this and recover cleanly by catching the exception.

   It is envisioned that there will be three most common ways in which
   providers will be used:

   1) The application does not care about what provider is used (the
   default case).

   2) The application wants a particular provider to be used
   preferentially, either for a particular mechanism or all the time,
   irrespective of mechanism.

   3) The application wants to use the locally configured providers as
   far as possible but if support is missing for one or more mechanisms
   then it wants to fall back on its own provider.

Internet-Draft             Java GSS-API Update              January 2006


   The GSSManager class has two methods that enable these modes of
   usage:  addProviderAtFront() and addProviderAtEnd().  These methods
   have the effect of creating an ordered list of <provider, oid> pairs
   where each pair indicates a preference of provider for a given oid.

   The use of these methods does not require any knowledge of whatever
   service provider specification the GSSManager subclass follows.  It
   is hoped that these methods will serve the needs of most
   applications.  Additional methods may be added to an extended
   GSSManager that could be part of a service provider specification
   that is standardized later.

7.1.1  Example Code

      GSSManager mgr = GSSManager.getInstance();

      // What mechs are available to us?
      Oid[] supportedMechs = mgr.getMechs();

      // Set a preference for the provider to be used when support
      // is needed for the mechanisms:
      //  "1.2.840.113554.1.2.2" and "1.3.6.1.5.5.1.1".

      Oid krb = new Oid("1.2.840.113554.1.2.2");
      Oid spkm1 = new Oid("1.3.6.1.5.5.1.1");

      Provider p = (Provider) (new com.foo.security.Provider());

      mgr.addProviderAtFront(p, krb);
      mgr.addProviderAtFront(p, spkm1);

      // What name types does this spkm implementation support?
      Oid[] nameTypes = mgr.getNamesForMech(spkm1);

   to GSS-API callers.  A "null" value is returned when no mechanism are
   available (an example of this would be when mechanism are dynamically
   configured, and currently no mechanisms are installed).

7.1.4  getNamesForMech

   public abstract Oid[] getNamesForMech(Oid mech)
                         throws GSSException

   Returns name type Oid's supported by the specified mechanism.

   Parameters:

      mech      The Oid object for the mechanism to query.


7.1.5  getMechsForName

   public abstract Oid[] getMechsForName(Oid nameType)

   Returns an array of Oid objects corresponding to the mechanisms that
   support the specific name type. "null" is returned when no mechanisms
   are found to support the specified name type.

   Parameters:

      nameType  The Oid object for the name type.


7.1.6  createName

   public abstract GSSName createName(String nameStr, Oid nameType)
                   throws GSSException

   Factory method to convert a contiguous string name from the specified
   namespace to a GSSName object.  In general, the GSSName object
   created will not be an MN; two examples that are exceptions to this
   are when the namespace type parameter indicates NT_EXPORT_NAME or
   when the GSS-API implementation is not multi-mechanism.

   Parameters:

      nameStr   The string representing a printable form of the name to
      create.

      nameType  The Oid specifying the namespace of the printable name
      supplied.  Note that nameType serves to describe and qualify the
      interpretation of the input nameStr, it does not necessarily imply

      a type for the output GSSName implementation. "null" value can be
      used to specify that a mechanism specific default printable syntax
      should be assumed by each mechanism that examines nameStr.


7.1.7  createName

   public abstract GSSName createName(byte[] name, Oid nameType)
                   throws GSSException

   Factory method to convert a contiguous byte array containing a name
   from the specified namespace to a GSSName object.  In general, the
   GSSName object created will not be an MN; two examples that are
   exceptions to this are when the namespace type parameter indicates
   NT_EXPORT_NAME or when the GSS-API implementation is not multi-
   mechanism.

   Parameters:

      name       The byte array containing the name to create.

      nameType   The Oid specifying the namespace of the name supplied
      in the byte array.  Note that nameType serves to describe and
      qualify the interpretation of the input name byte array, it does
      not necessarily imply a type for the output GSSName
      implementation. "null" value can be used to specify that a
      mechanism specific default syntax should be assumed by each
      mechanism that examines the byte array.

7.1.9  createName

   public abstract GSSName createName(byte[] name, Oid nameType,
                   Oid mech) throws GSSException

   Factory method to convert a contiguous byte array containing a name
   from the specified namespace to a GSSName object that is an MN.  In
   other words, this method is a utility that does the equivalent of two
   steps: the createName described in 7.1.7 and then also the
   GSSName.canonicalize() described in 7.2.5.

   Parameters:

      name      The byte array representing the name to create.

      nameType  The Oid specifying the namespace of the name supplied in
      the byte array.  Note that nameType serves to describe and qualify
      the interpretation of the input name byte array, it does not
      necessarily imply a type for the output GSSName implementation.
      "null" value can be used to specify that a mechanism specific
      default syntax should be assumed by each mechanism that examines
      the byte array.

7.1.16  addProviderAtFront

   public abstract void addProviderAtFront(Provider p, Oid mech)
                   throws GSSException

   This method is used to indicate to the GSSManager that the
   application would like a particular provider to be used ahead of all
   others when support is desired for the given mechanism.  When a value
   of null is used instead of an Oid for the mechanism, the GSSManager
   must use the indicated provider ahead of all others no matter what
   the mechanism is.  Only when the indicated provider does not support
   the needed mechanism should the GSSManager move on to a different
   provider.

   Calling this method repeatedly preserves the older settings but
   lowers them in preference thus forming an ordered list of provider
   and Oid pairs that grows at the top.

   Calling addProviderAtFront with a null Oid will remove all previous
   preferences that were set for this provider in the GSSManager
   instance.  Calling addProviderAtFront with a non-null Oid will remove
   any previous preference that was set using this mechanism and this
   provider together.

   If the GSSManager implementation does not support an SPI with a
   pluggable provider architecture it should throw a GSSException with
   the status code GSSException.UNAVAILABLE to indicate that the
   operation is unavailable.

   Parameters:

      p         The provider instance that should be used whenever
      support is needed for mech.

      mech      The mechanism for which the provider is being set


7.1.17  Example Code

   Suppose an application desired that the provider A always be checked
   first when any mechanism is needed, it would call:

           GSSManager mgr = GSSManager.getInstance();
           // mgr may at this point have its own pre-configured list
           // of provider preferences. The following will prepend to
           // any such list:

           mgr.addProviderAtFront(A, null);

   Now if it also desired that the mechanism of Oid m1 always be
   obtained from the provider B before the previously set A was checked,
   it would call:

           mgr.addProviderAtFront(B, m1);

   The GSSManager would then first check with B if m1 was needed.  In
   case B did not provide support for m1, the GSSManager would continue
   on to check with A.	If any mechanism m2 is needed where m2 is
   different from m1 then the GSSManager would skip B and check with A
   directly.

   Suppose at a later time the following call is made to the same
   GSSManager instance:

              mgr.addProviderAtFront(B, null)

   then the previous setting with the pair (B, m1) is subsumed by this
   and should be removed.  Effectively the list of preferences now
   becomes {(B, null), (A, null), ... //followed by the pre-configured
   list.

   Please note, however, that the following call:

              mgr.addProviderAtFront(A, m3)

   does not subsume the previous setting of (A, null) and the list will
   effectively become {(A, m3), (B, null), (A, null), ...}

7.1.18  addProviderAtEnd

   public abstract void addProviderAtEnd(Provider p, Oid mech)
                   throws GSSException

   This method is used to indicate to the GSSManager that the
   application would like a particular provider to be used if no other
   provider can be found that supports the given mechanism.  When a
   value of null is used instead of an Oid for the mechanism, the
   GSSManager must use the indicated provider for any mechanism.

   Calling this method repeatedly preserves the older settings but
   raises them above newer ones in preference thus forming an ordered
   list of providers and Oid pairs that grows at the bottom.  Thus the
   older provider settings will be utilized first before this one is.

   If there are any previously existing preferences that conflict with
   the preference being set here, then the GSSManager should ignore this
   request.

   If the GSSManager implementation does not support an SPI with a
   pluggable provider architecture it should throw a GSSException with
   the status code GSSException.UNAVAILABLE to indicate that the
   operation is unavailable.

   Parameters:

      p         The provider instance that should be used whenever
      support is needed for mech.

      mech	     The mechanism for which the provider is being set


7.1.19  Example Code

   Suppose an application desired that when a mechanism of Oid m1 is
   needed the system default providers always be checked first, and only
   when they do not support m1 should a provider A be checked.  It would
   then make the call:

           GSSManager mgr = GSSManager.getInstance();

           mgr.addProviderAtEnd(A, m1);

   Now, if it also desired that for all mechanisms the provider B be
   checked after all configured providers have been checked, it would
   then call:

              mgr.addProviderAtEnd(B, null);

   Effectively the list of preferences now becomes {..., (A, m1), (B,
   null)}.

   Suppose at a later time the following call is made to the same
   GSSManager instance:

              mgr.addProviderAtEnd(B, m2)

   then the previous setting with the pair (B, null) subsumes this and
   therefore this request should be ignored.  The same would happen if a
   request is made for the already existing pairs of (A, m1) or (B,
   null).

   Please note, however, that the following call:

              mgr.addProviderAtEnd(A, null)

   is not subsumed by the previous setting of (A, m1) and the list will
   effectively become {..., (A, m1), (B, null), (A, null)}

   mit(113554) infosys(1) gssapi(2) generic(1) user_name(1) }

   public static final Oid NT_MACHINE_UID_NAME

   Name type to indicate a numeric user identifier corresponding to a
   user on a local system. (e.g.  Uid).	It represents the following
   value: { iso(1) member-body(2) United States(840) mit(113554)
   infosys(1) gssapi(2) generic(1) machine_uid_name(2) }

   public static final Oid NT_STRING_UID_NAME

   following value:  { iso(1) member-body(2) United States(840)
   mit(113554) infosys(1) gssapi(2) generic(1) string_uid_name(3) }

   to override the Object.equals() method that the implementing class
   will inherit.  The behavior is exactly the same as that in 7.2.3
   except that no GSSException is thrown; instead, false will be
   returned in the situation where an error occurs.  (Note that the Java
   language specification requires that two objects that are equal
   according to the equals(Object) method must return the same integer
   result when the hashCode() method is called on them.)

   Parameters:

      another   GSSName object to compare with.


7.2.5  canonicalize

   public GSSName canonicalize(Oid mech) throws GSSException

   Creates a mechanism name (MN) from an arbitrary internal name.  This
   is equivalent to using the factory methods described in 7.1.8 or
   7.1.9 that take the mechanism name as one of their parameters.

   Parameters:

      mech      The oid for the mechanism for which the canonical form
      of the name is requested.


7.2.6  export

   public byte[] export() throws GSSException

   Returns a canonical contiguous byte representation of a mechanism
   name (MN), suitable for direct, byte by byte comparison by
   authorization functions.  If the name is not an MN, implementations
   may throw a GSSException with the NAME_NOT_MN status code.  If an
   implementation chooses not to throw an exception, it should use some
   system specific default mechanism to canonicalize the name and then
   export it.  The format of the header of the output buffer is
   specified in RFC 2743.

7.2.7  toString

   public String toString()

   Returns a textual representation of the GSSName object.  To retrieve
   the printed name format, which determines the syntax of the returned
   string, the getStringNameType method can be used.

7.2.8  getStringNameType

   public Oid getStringNameType() throws GSSException

   Returns the oid representing the type of name returned through the
   toString method.  Using this oid, the syntax of the printable name
   can be determined.

7.2.9  isAnonymous

   public boolean isAnonymous()

   Tests if this name object represents an anonymous entity.  Returns
   "true" if this is an anonymous name.

7.2.10  isMN

   public boolean isMN()

   Tests if this name object contains only one mechanism element and is
   thus a mechanism name as defined by RFC 2743.

7.3  public interface GSSCredential implements Cloneable

   This interface encapsulates the GSS-API credentials for an entity.  A
   credential contains all the necessary cryptographic information to
   enable the creation of a context on behalf of the entity that it
   represents.	It may contain multiple, distinct, mechanism specific
   credential elements, each containing information for a specific
   security mechanism, but all referring to the same entity.

   A credential may be used to perform context initiation, acceptance,
   or both.

   GSS-API implementations must impose a local access-control policy on
   callers to prevent unauthorized callers from acquiring credentials to
   which they are not entitled.	 GSS-API credential creation is not
   intended to provide a "login to the network" function, as such a
   function would involve the creation of new credentials rather than
   merely acquiring a handle to existing credentials.  Such functions,
   if required, should be defined in implementation-specific extensions
   to the API.

   If credential acquisition is time-consuming for a mechanism, the
   mechanism may choose to delay the actual acquisition until the
   credential is required (e.g.	 by GSSContext).  Such mechanism-
   specific implementation decisions should be invisible to the calling
   application; thus the query methods immediately following the

Internet-Draft             Java GSS-API Update              January 2006


   creation of a credential object must return valid credential data,
   and may therefore incur the overhead of a deferred credential
   acquisition.

   Applications will create a credential object passing the desired
   parameters.	The application can then use the query methods to obtain
   specific information about the instantiated credential object
   (equivalent to the gss_inquire routines).  When the credential is no
   longer needed, the application should call the dispose (equivalent to
   gss_release_cred) method to release any resources held by the
   credential object and to destroy any cryptographically sensitive
   information.

   Classes implementing this interface also implement the Cloneable
   interface.  This indicates the the class will support the clone()
   method that will allow the creation of duplicate credentials.  This
   is useful when called just before the add() call to retain a copy of
   the original credential.

7.3.1  Example Code

   This example code demonstrates the creation of a GSSCredential
   implementation for a specific entity, querying of its fields, and its
   release when it is no longer needed.

      GSSManager mgr = GSSManager.getInstance();

      // start by creating a name object for the entity
      GSSName name = mgr.createName("userName", GSSName.NT_USER_NAME);

      // now acquire credentials for the entity
      GSSCredential cred = mgr.createCredential(name,
                           GSSCredential.ACCEPT_ONLY);

      // display credential information - name, remaining lifetime,
      // and the mechanisms it has been acquired over
      print(cred.getName().toString());
      print(cred.getRemainingLifetime());

      Oid[] mechs = cred.getMechs();
      if (mechs != null) {
         for (int i = 0; i < mechs.length; i++)
             print(mechs[i].toString());
      }

      // release system resources held by the credential

   Parameters:

      mechOID   The mechanism for which information should be returned.


7.3.11  getMechs

   public Oid[] getMechs() throws GSSException

   Returns an array of mechanisms supported by this credential.

7.3.12  add

   public void add(GSSName aName, int initLifetime, int acceptLifetime,
                   Oid mech, int usage) throws GSSException

   Adds a mechanism specific credential-element to an existing
   credential.	This method allows the construction of credentials one
   mechanism at a time.

   This routine is envisioned to be used mainly by context acceptors
   during the creation of acceptance credentials which are to be used
   with a variety of clients using different security mechanisms.

   This routine adds the new credential element "in-place".  To add the
   element in a new credential, first call clone() to obtain a copy of
   this credential, then call its add() method.

   Parameters:

      aName     Name of the principal for whom this credential is to be
      acquired.  Use "null" to specify the default principal.

      mech      The mechanisms over which the credential is to be
      acquired.

      usage     The intended usage for this credential object.  The
      value of this parameter must be one of:
      GSSCredential.INITIATE_AND_ACCEPT(0),
      GSSCredential.INITIATE_ONLY(1), GSSCredential.ACCEPT_ONLY(2)


7.3.13  equals

   public boolean equals(Object another)

   Tests if this GSSCredential refers to the same entity as the supplied
   object.  The two credentials must be acquired over the same
   mechanisms and must refer to the same principal.  Returns "true" if
   the two GSSCredentials refer to the same entity; "false" otherwise.
   (Note that the Java language specification requires that two objects
   that are equal according to the equals(Object) method must return the
   same integer result when the hashCode() method is called on them.)

   Parameters:

      another   Another GSSCredential object for comparison.


7.4  public interface GSSContext

   This interface encapsulates the GSS-API security context and provides
   the security services (wrap, unwrap, getMIC, verifyMIC) that are
   available over the context.	Security contexts are established between
   peers using locally acquired credentials.  Multiple contexts may
   exist simultaneously between a pair of peers, using the same or
   different set of credentials.  GSS-API functions in a manner

   independent of the underlying transport protocol and depends on its
   calling application to transport its tokens between peers.

   Before the context establishment phase is initiated, the context
   initiator may request specific characteristics desired of the
   established context.	 These can be set using the set methods.  After
   the context is established, the caller can check the actual
   characteristic and services offered by the context using the query
   methods.

   The context establishment phase begins with the first call to the
   init method by the context initiator.  During this phase the
   initSecContext and acceptSecContext methods will produce GSS-API
   authentication tokens which the calling application needs to send to
   its peer.  If an error occurs at any point, an exception will get
   thrown and the code will start executing in a catch block.  If not,
   the normal flow of code continues and the application can make a call
   to the isEstablished() method.  If this method returns false it
   indicates that a token is needed from its peer in order to continue
   the context establishment phase.  A return value of true signals that
   the local end of the context is established.	 This may still require
   that a token be sent to the peer, if one is produced by GSS-API.
   During the context establishment phase, the isProtReady() method may
   be called to determine if the context can be used for the per-message
   operations.	This allows applications to use per-message operations on
   contexts which aren't fully established.

   After the context has been established or the isProtReady() method
   returns "true", the query routines can be invoked to determine the
   actual characteristics and services of the established context.  The
   application can also start using the per-message methods of wrap and
   getMIC to obtain cryptographic operations on application supplied
   data.

   When the context is no longer needed, the application should call
   dispose to release any system resources the context may be using.

7.4.1  Example Code

   The example code presented below demonstrates the usage of the
   GSSContext interface for the initiating peer.  Different operations
   on the GSSContext object are presented, including: object
   instantiation, setting of desired flags, context establishment, query
   of actual context flags, per-message operations on application data,
   and finally context deletion.

      GSSManager mgr = GSSManager.getInstance();

7.4.11  isEstablished

   public boolean isEstablished()

   Used during context establishment to determine the state of the
   context.  Returns "true" if this is a fully established context on
   the caller's side and no more tokens are needed from the peer.
   Should be called after a call to initSecContext() or
   acceptSecContext() when no GSSException is thrown.

7.4.12  dispose

   public void dispose() throws GSSException

   Releases any system resources and cryptographic information stored in
   the context object.	This will invalidate the context.

7.4.13  getWrapSizeLimit

   public int getWrapSizeLimit(int qop, boolean confReq,
              int maxTokenSize) throws GSSException

   Returns the maximum message size that, if presented to the wrap
   method with the same confReq and qop parameters, will result in an
   output token containing no more than the maxTokenSize bytes.

   This call is intended for use by applications that communicate over
   protocols that impose a maximum message size.  It enables the
   application to fragment messages prior to applying protection.

   GSS-API implementations are recommended but not required to detect
   invalid QOP values when getWrapSizeLimit is called.	This routine
   guarantees only a maximum message size, not the availability of
   specific QOP values for message protection.

   Successful completion of this call does not guarantee that wrap will
   be able to protect a message of the computed length, since this
   ability may depend on the availability of system resources at the
   time that wrap is called.  However, if the implementation itself
   imposes an upper limit on the length of messages that may be
   processed by wrap, the implementation should not return a value that
   is greater than this length.

   Parameters:

      qop       Indicates the level of protection wrap will be asked to
      provide.

      confReq   Indicates if wrap will be asked to provide privacy
      service.

      maxTokenSize The desired maximum size of the token emitted by
      wrap.


7.4.14  wrap

   public byte[] wrap(byte[] inBuf, int offset, int len,
                      MessageProp msgProp) throws GSSException

   Applies per-message security services over the established security
   context.  The method will return a token with a cryptographic MIC and
   may optionally encrypt the specified inBuf.	This method is equivalent
   in functionality to its stream counterpart.  The returned byte array
   will contain both the MIC and the message.

   The MessageProp object is instantiated by the application and used to
   specify a QOP value which selects cryptographic algorithms, and a
   privacy service to optionally encrypt the message.  The underlying
   mechanism that is used in the call may not be able to provide the
   privacy service.  It sets the actual privacy service that it does
   provide in this MessageProp object which the caller should then query
   upon return.	 If the mechanism is not able to provide the requested
   QOP, it throws a GSSException with the BAD_QOP code.

   Since some application-level protocols may wish to use tokens emitted
   by wrap to provide "secure framing", implementations should support
   the wrapping of zero-length messages.

   The application will be responsible for sending the token to the
   peer.

   Parameters:

      inBuf     Application data to be protected.

      offset    The offset within the inBuf where the data begins.

      len       The length of the data within the inBuf (starting at the
      offset).

      msgProp   Instance of MessageProp that is used by the application
      to set the desired QOP and privacy state.  Set the desired QOP to
      0 to request the default QOP.  Upon return from this method, this
      object will contain the the actual privacy state that was applied
      to the message by the underlying mechanism.


7.4.15  wrap

   public void wrap(InputStream inStream, OutputStream outStream,

   cryptographic MIC and may optionally encrypt the message in inStream.
   The outStream will contain both the MIC and the message.

   The MessageProp object is instantiated by the application and used to

      protected.

      outStream The output stream to write the protected message to.
      The application is responsible for sending this to the other peer
      for processing in its unwrap method.

      msgProp   Instance of MessageProp that is used by the application
      to set the desired QOP and privacy state.  Set the desired QOP to
      0 to request the default QOP.  Upon return from this method, this
      object will contain the the actual privacy state that was applied

   Used by the peer application to process tokens generated with the
   wrap call.  This call is equal in functionality to its stream
   counterpart.	 The method will return the message supplied in the peer
   application to the wrap call, verifying the embedded MIC.

   The MessageProp object is instantiated by the application and is used

   public byte[] getMIC(byte[] inMsg, int offset, int len,
                        MessageProp msgProp) throws GSSException

   Returns a token containing a cryptographic MIC for the supplied
   message,  for transfer to the peer application.  Unlike wrap, which
   encapsulates the user message in the returned token, only the message
   MIC is returned in the output token.	 This method is identical in
   functionality to its stream counterpart.

   Note that privacy can only be applied through the wrap call.

   Since some application-level protocols may wish to use tokens emitted
   by getMIC to provide "secure framing", implementations should support
   derivation of MICs from zero-length messages.

   Parameters:

      inMsg     Message to generate MIC over.

      offset    The offset within the inMsg where the token begins.

      len       The length of the token within the inMsg (starting at

   Parameters:

      inTok     Token generated by peer's getMIC method.

      tokOffset The offset within the inTok where the token begins.

   requests and accepts security contexts over them, then passes the
   established context to one or more other processes for message
   exchange.

   This method deactivates the security context and creates an
   interprocess token which, when passed to the byte array constructor
   of the GSSContext interface in another process, will re-activate the
   context in the second process.  Only a single instantiation of a
   given context may be active at any one time; a subsequent attempt by
   a context exporter to access the exported security context will fail.

   The implementation may constrain the set of processes by which the
   interprocess token may be imported, either as a function of local
   security policy, or as a result of implementation decisions.	 For
   example, some implementations may constrain contexts to be passed
   only between processes that run under the same account, or which are
   part of the same process group.

   The interprocess token may contain security-sensitive information
   (for example cryptographic keys).  While mechanisms are encouraged to
   either avoid placing such sensitive information within interprocess
   tokens, or to encrypt the token before returning it to the
   application, in a typical GSS-API implementation this may not be
   possible.  Thus the application must take care to protect the
   interprocess token, and ensure that any process to which the token is
   transferred is trustworthy.

7.4.23  requestMutualAuth

   only valid after the context creation process has started.

7.5  public class MessageProp

   This is a utility class used within the per-message GSSContext

   methods to convey per-message properties.

   When used with the GSSContext interface's wrap and getMIC methods, an
   instance of this class is used to indicate the desired QOP and to
   request if confidentiality services are to be applied to caller
   supplied data (wrap only).  To request default QOP, the value of 0
   should be used for QOP.

   When used with the unwrap and verifyMIC methods of the GSSContext
   interface, an instance of this class will be used to indicate the
   applied QOP and confidentiality services over the supplied message.
   In the case of verifyMIC, the confidentiality state will always be
   "false".  Upon return from these methods, this object will also
   contain any supplementary status values applicable to the processed
   token.  The supplementary status values can indicate old tokens, out
   of sequence tokens, gap tokens or duplicate tokens.

7.5.1  Constructors

   public MessageProp(boolean privState)

   Constructor which sets QOP to 0 indicating that the default QOP is
   requested.

   Parameters:

      privState The desired privacy state. "true" for privacy and
      "false" for integrity only.

   public MessageProp(int qop, boolean privState)

   Constructor which sets the values for the qop and privacy state.

   Parameters:

      qop       The desired QOP.  Use 0 to request a default QOP.

7.6  public class ChannelBinding

   The GSS-API accommodates the concept of caller-provided channel
   binding information.	 Channel bindings are used to strengthen the
   quality with which peer entity authentication is provided during
   context establishment.  They enable the GSS-API callers to bind the
   establishment of the security context to relevant characteristics
   like addresses or to application specific data.

   The caller initiating the security context must determine the
   appropriate channel binding values to set in the GSSContext object.
   The acceptor must provide an identical binding in order to validate
   that received tokens possess correct channel-related characteristics.

   Use of channel bindings is optional in GSS-API.  Since channel-
   binding information may be transmitted in context establishment
   tokens, applications should therefore not use confidential data as
   channel-binding components.

7.6.1  Constructors

   public ChannelBinding(InetAddress initAddr, InetAddress acceptAddr,
                         byte[] appData)

   Create a ChannelBinding object with user supplied address information
   and data. "null" values can be used for any fields which the
   application does not want to specify.

   Parameters:

      initAddr  The address of the context initiator. "null" value can
      be supplied to indicate that the application does not want to set
      this value.

      acceptAddr The address of the context acceptor. "null" value can
      be supplied to indicate that the application does not want to set
      this value.

      appData   Application supplied data to be used as part of the
      channel bindings. "null" value can be supplied to indicate that
      the application does not want to set this value.

   public ChannelBinding(byte[] appData)

   Creates a ChannelBinding object without any addressing information.

   Parameters:

      appData   Application supplied data to be used as part of the
      channel bindings.


7.6.2  getInitiatorAddress

   public InetAddress getInitiatorAddress()

   Returns the initiator's address for this channel binding. "null" is
   returned if the address has not been set.

7.6.3  getAcceptorAddress

   public InetAddress getAcceptorAddress()

   Returns the acceptor's address for this channel binding. "null" is
   returned if the address has not been set.

7.6.4  getApplicationData

   public byte[] getApplicationData()

   Returns application data being used as part of the ChannelBinding.
   "null" is returned if no application data has been specified for the
   channel binding.

7.6.5  equals

   public boolean equals(Object obj)

   Returns "true" if two channel bindings match.  (Note that the Java
   language specification requires that two objects that are equal
   according to the equals(Object) method must return the same integer
   result when the hashCode() method is called on them.)

   Parameters:

      obj       Another channel binding to compare with.


7.7  public class Oid

   This class represents Universal Object Identifiers (Oids) and their
   associated operations.

   Oids are hierarchically globally-interpretable identifiers used
   within the GSS-API framework to identify mechanisms and name formats.

Internet-Draft             Java GSS-API Update              January 2006


   The structure and encoding of Oids is defined in ISOIEC-8824 and
   ISOIEC-8825.	 For example the Oid representation of Kerberos V5
   mechanism is "1.2.840.113554.1.2.2"

   The GSSName name class contains public static Oid objects
   representing the standard name types defined in GSS-API.

7.7.1  Constructors

   public Oid(String strOid) throws GSSException

   Creates an Oid object from a string representation of its integer
   components (e.g. "1.2.840.113554.1.2.2").

   Parameters:

      strOid    The string representation for the oid.

   public Oid(InputStream derOid) throws GSSException

   Creates an Oid object from its DER encoding.	 This refers to the full
   encoding including tag and length.  The structure and encoding of
   Oids is defined in ISOIEC-8824 and ISOIEC-8825.  This method is
   identical in functionality to its byte array counterpart.

   Parameters:

      derOid    Stream containing the DER encoded oid.

   public Oid(byte[] DEROid) throws GSSException

   Creates an Oid object from its DER encoding.	 This refers to the full
   encoding including tag and length.  The structure and encoding of
   Oids is defined in ISOIEC-8824 and ISOIEC-8825.  This method is
   identical in functionality to its byte array counterpart.

   Parameters:

      derOid    Byte array storing a DER encoded oid.


7.7.2  toString

   public String toString()

   Returns a string representation of the oid's integer components in
   dot separated notation (e.g. "1.2.840.113554.1.2.2").

7.7.3  equals

   public boolean equals(Object Obj)

   Returns "true" if the two Oid objects represent the same oid value.
   (Note that the Java language specification requires that two objects
   that are equal according to the equals(Object) method must return the
   same integer result when the hashCode() method is called on them.)

   Parameters:

      obj       Another Oid object to compare with.

   public byte[] getDER()

   Returns the full ASN.1 DER encoding for this oid object, which
   includes the tag and length.

7.7.5  containedIn

   public boolean containedIn(Oid[] oids)

   A utility method to test if an Oid object is contained within the
   supplied Oid object array.

   Parameters:

      oids      An array of oids to search.


7.8  public class GSSException extends Exception

   This exception is thrown whenever a fatal GSS-API error occurs
   including mechanism specific errors.	 It may contain both, the major
   and minor, GSS-API status codes.  The mechanism implementers are
   responsible for setting appropriate minor status codes when throwing
   this exception.  Aside from delivering the numeric error code(s) to
   the caller, this class performs the mapping from their numeric values
   to textual representations.	All Java GSS-API methods are declared
   throwing this exception.

   All implementations are encouraged to use the Java
   internationalization techniques to provide local translations of the
   message strings.

9.  Security Considerations

   The Java language security model allows platform providers to have
   policy based fine-grained access control over any resource that an
   application wants.  When using a Java security manager (such as, but
   not limited to, the case of applets running in browsers) the
   application code is in a sandbox by default.

   Administrators of the platform JRE determine what permissions, if
   any, are to be given to source from different codebases.  Thus the
   administrator has to be aware of any special requirements that the
   GSS provider might have for system resources.  For instance, a
   Kerberos provider might wish to make a network connection to the KDC
   to obtain initial credentials.  This would not be allowed under the
   sandbox unless the administrator had granted permissions for this.
   Also note that this granting and checking of permissions happens
   transparently to the application and is outside the scope of this
   document.

   The Java language allows administrators to pre-configure a list of
   security service providers in the <JRE>/lib/security/java.security
   file.  At runtime, the system approaches these providers in order of
   preference when looking for security related services.  Applications
   have a means to modify this list through methods in the "Security"
   class in the "java.security" package.  However, since these
   modifications would be visible in the entire JVM and thus affect all
   code executing in it, this operation is not available in the sandbox
   and requires special permissions to perform.  Thus when a GSS
   application has special needs that are met by a particular security
   provider, it has two choices:

   1) To install the provider on a JVM wide basis using the
   java.security.Security class and then depend on the system to find
   the right provider automatically when the need arises.  (This would
   require the application to be granted a "insertProvider
   SecurityPermission".)

   2) To pass an instance of the provider to the local instance of
   GSSManager so that only factory calls going through that GSSManager
   use the desired provider.  (This would not require any permissions.)
