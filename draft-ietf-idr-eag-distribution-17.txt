1.  Introduction

   Administrative groups (commonly referred to as "colors" or "link
   colors") are link attributes that are advertised by link state
   protocols like IS-IS [RFC1195], OSPFv2 [RFC2328] and OSPFv3
   [RFC5340].  The BGP-LS advertisement of the originally defined (non-
   extended) administrative groups is encoded using the Administrative
   Group (color) TLV 1088 as defined in [RFC7752].

   These administrative groups are defined as a fixed-length 32-bit
   bitmask.  As networks grew and more use-cases were introduced, the
   32-bit length was found to be constraining and hence extended
   administrative groups (EAG) were introduced in [RFC7308].

   The EAG TLV (Section 2) is not a replacement for the Administrative
   Group (color) TLV; as explained in [RFC7308] both values can coexist.
   It is out of scope for this document to specify the behavior of the
   BGP-LS consumer [RFC7752].

   This document specifies an extension to BGP-LS for advertisement of
   the extended administrative groups.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Advertising Extended Administrative Group in BGP-LS

   This document defines an extension that enables BGP-LS speakers to
   signal the EAG of links in a network to a BGP-LS consumer of network
   topology such as a centralized controller.  The centralized
   controller can leverage this information in traffic engineering
   computations and other use-cases.  When a BGP-LS speaker is
   originating the topology learnt via link-state routing protocols like
   OSPF or IS-IS, the EAG information of the links is sourced from the
   underlying extensions as defined in [RFC7308].

   The EAG of a link is encoded in a new Link Attribute TLV [RFC7752]
   using the following format:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |              Type             |             Length            |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |    Extended Administrative Group (variable)                 //
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

            Figure 1: Extended Administrative Group TLV Format

   Where:

   o  Type: 1173

   o  Length: variable length which represents the total length of the
      value field in octets.  The length value MUST be a multiple of 4.
      If the length is not a multiple of 4, the TLV MUST be considered
      malformed.

   o  Value: one or more sets of 32-bit bitmasks that indicate the
      administrative groups (colors) that are enabled on the link when
      those specific bits are set.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests assigning a code-point from the registry "BGP-
   LS Node Descriptor, Link Descriptor, Prefix Descriptor, and Attribute
   TLVs" based on table below.  Early allocation for these code-points
   have been done by IANA.

4.  Security Considerations

   The procedures and protocol extensions defined in this document do
   not affect the BGP security model.  See the "Security Considerations"
   section of [RFC4271] for a discussion of BGP security.  Also, refer
   to [RFC4272] and [RFC6952] for analyses of security issues for BGP.
   Security considerations for acquiring and distributing BGP-LS
   information are discussed in [RFC7752].  The TLV introduced in this
   document is used to propagate the EAG extensions defined in
   [RFC7308].  It is assumed that the IGP instances originating this TLV
   will support all the required security (as described in [RFC7308]) in
   order to prevent any security issues when propagating the TLVs into
   BGP-LS.  The advertisement of the link attribute information defined
   in this document presents no significant additional risk beyond that
   associated with the existing link attribute information already
   supported in [RFC7752].
