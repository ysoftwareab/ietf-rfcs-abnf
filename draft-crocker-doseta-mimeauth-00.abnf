i=   This specifies an Internal Identifier (IID) token that can be
         used when referring to the signed data, back to the signer.
         Within the MIMEAUTH protocol, the string has no value except as
         a literal token.  Any conventions for the string that are
         imposed by the signer are unknown to other MIMEAUTH
         participants.

         The syntax is the form of a standard email address where the
         <local-part> MAY be omitted.

         Internationalized domain names MUST be converted using the
         steps listed in Section 4 of [RFC5890] using the "ToASCII"
         function.

z=    Copied header fields (DOSETA-quoted-printable, but see
         description; OPTIONAL, default is null).  A vertical-bar-
         separated list of selected header fields present when the
         message was signed, including both the field name and value.
         It is not required to include all header fields present at the
         time of signing.  This field need not contain the same header
         fields listed in the "h=" tag.  The header field text itself
         MUST encode the vertical bar ("|", %x7C) character.  That is,
         vertical bars in the "z=" text are meta-characters, and any
         actual vertical bar characters in a copied header field MUST be
         encoded.  Note that all whitespace MUST be encoded, including
         whitespace between the colon and the header field value.  After
         encoding, FWS MAY be added at arbitrary locations in order to
         avoid excessively long lines; such whitespace is NOT part of
         the value of the header field, and MUST be removed before
         decoding.

         Copied header field values are for diagnostic use.

         Header fields with characters requiring conversion SHOULD be
         converted as described in MIME Part Three [RFC2047].
