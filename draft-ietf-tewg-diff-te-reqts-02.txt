Abstract 
    
   This document presents the Service Provider requirements for support 
   of Diff-Serv aware MPLS Traffic Engineering (DS-TE) as discussed in 
   the Traffic Engineering Working Group Framework document [TEWG-FW].  
    
    
1.      Introduction 
    
1.1.    Problem Statement 
 
   Diff-Serv is becoming prominent in providing scalable network 
   designs supporting multiple classes of services.  
    
   In some Diff-Serv networks where optimization of transmission 
   resources on a network-wide basis is not sought, MPLS Traffic 
   Engineering (TE) mechanisms may simply not be used.  
    
   In other networks, where optimization of transmission resources is 
   sought, Diff-Serv mechanisms [DIFF-MPLS] need to be complemented by 
   existing MPLS Traffic Engineering mechanisms [TE-REQ] [ISIS-TE] 
   [OSPF-TE] [RSVP-TE] [CR-LDP] which operate on an aggregate basis 
   across all classes of service. In this case, Diff-Serv and MPLS TE 
   both provide their respective benefits.  
    
   Where fine-grained optimization of transmission resources is sought, 
   it is necessary to perform traffic engineering at a per-class level 
   instead of an aggregate level, in order to further enhance networks 
   in performance and efficiency as discussed in [TEWG-FW]. By mapping 
   the traffic from a given class of service on a separate LSP, it 
   allows this traffic to utilize resources available to the given 
   class on both shortest path and non-shortest paths and follow paths 
   that meet engineering constraints which are specific to the given 
   class. This is what we refer to as "Diff-Serv-aware Traffic 
   Engineering (DS-TE)". 
    
   This document focuses exclusively on the specific environments which 
   would benefit from DS-TE. Some examples include: 
    
     -    networks where bandwidth is scarce (e.g. transcontinental 
          networks) 
     -    networks with significant amounts of delay-sensitive traffic 
     -    networks where the relative proportion of traffic across 
          classes of service is not uniform

            Requirements for Diff-Serv Traffic EngineeringNovember 2001 
 
   This document focuses on intra-domain operation. Inter-domain 
   operation is not considered. 
    
1.2.    Definitions 
    
   For the convenience of the reader, relevant Diffserv ([DIFF-ARCH], 
   [DIFF-NEW]) definitions are repeated herein. 
    
       Behavior Aggregate (BA): a collection of packets with the same 
       codepoint crossing a link in a particular direction. 
        
       PHB Scheduling Class (PSC): A PHB group for which a common 
       constraint is that ordering of at least those packets belonging 
       to the same microflow must be preserved. 
    
       Ordered Aggregate (OA): a set of BAs that share an ordering 
       constraint. The set of PHBs that are applied to this set of 
       Behavior Aggregates constitutes a PHB scheduling class. 
    
   We also repeat the following definition from [TE-REQ]: 
    
       Traffic Trunk: an aggregation of traffic flows of the same class 
       which are placed inside a Label Switched Path. 
       [Note: in the context of the present document, "flows of the 
       same class" is to be interpreted as "flows from the same 
       Forwarding Equivalence Class which are to be treated 
       equivalently from the DS-TE perspective".] 
        
 
1.3.    Mapping of traffic to LSPs 
    
   A network may have multiple classes of traffic it wishes to service.  
   Recalling from [DIFF-MPLS], there are several options on how the 
   Diff-Serv Ordered Aggregates (OAs) can be split into multiple 
   Traffic Trunks for mapping onto LSPs when using DSTE.  
    
   One option is to split traffic into Traffic Trunks which each 
   comprises traffic from multiple OAs. This option is typically used 
   when aggregate traffic engineering is deployed using current MPLS TE 
   mechanisms. Note that this LSP is then, by definition, an E-LSP as 
   defined in [DIFF-MPLS]. 
    
   Another option is to split traffic into Traffic Trunks which each 
   comprises traffic from a single OA. DS-TE assumes this mode of 
   operation. Note that the LSP used to transport such a Traffic Trunk 
   may then be an L-LSP (as defined in [DIFF-MPLS]) or may be an E-LSP 
   onto which a single (or a subset of the) OA is transported. Thus, 
   traffic from a given node to another given node, is split into 
   multiple Traffic Trunks which are transported over separate LSPs, 
   which can potentially follow a different path through the network. 
   DS-TE precisely takes advantage of this fact and indeed computes a 
   separate path for each LSP. In so doing, DS-TE can take into account

            Requirements for Diff-Serv Traffic EngineeringNovember 2001 
 
   the specific requirements of the Traffic Trunk transported on each 
   LSP (e.g. bandwidth requirement, preemption priority). Moreover DS-
   TE can take into account the specific resources which have been 
   allocated inside the network to different sets of Traffic Trunks 
   (e.g. PHB resources allocated to be used by all the Traffic Trunks 
   of a given OA) and specific engineering constraints to be enforced 
   for these sets of Traffic Trunks (e.g. limit all Traffic Trunks from 
   a given OA to x% of link capacity). In brief, DS-TE achieves per LSP 
   constraint based routing with paths that tightly match the specific 
   objectives of each Traffic Trunk and of each OA to whom the traffic 
   Trunk belongs. 
    
    
2.      Application Scenarios 
 
2.1.    Scenario 1: Limiting Proportion of Classes on a Link 
    
   An IP/MPLS network may need to carry a significant amount of VoIP 
   traffic compared to its link capacity. For example, 10,000 
   uncompressed calls at 20ms packetization result in about 1Gbps of IP 
   traffic, which is significant on an OC-48c based network. In case of 
   topology changes such as link/node failure, VoIP traffic levels can 
   even approach the full bandwidth on certain links. 
     
   For delay/jitter reasons it is undesirable to carry more than a 
   certain percentage of VoIP traffic on any link. The rest of the 
   available link bandwidth can be used to route other classes 
   corresponding to delay/jitter insensitive traffic (e.g. Best Effort 
   Internet traffic). The exact determination of this "certain" 
   percentage is outside the scope of this requirements draft. 
     
   During normal operations, the VoIP traffic should be able to preempt 
   other classes of traffic (if these other classes are designated as 
   preemptable and they have lower preemption priority),  
   so that it will be able to use the shortest available path, only 
   constrained by the maximum defined link utilization ratio/percentage 
   of the VoIP class. 
    
   Existing TE mechanisms only allow constraint based routing of 
   traffic based on a single bandwidth constraint common to all 
   classes, which does not satisfy the needs described here. This leads 
   to the requirement for DS-TE to be able to enforce a different 
   bandwidth constraint for different classes of traffic. In the above 
   example, the bandwidth constraint to be enforced for VoIP traffic 
   may be the "certain" percentage of each link capacity, while the 
   bandwidth constraint to be enforced for the rest of the classes 
   might have their own constraints or have access to the rest of the 
   link capacity.  
    
2.2.    Scenario 2: Maintain relative proportion of traffic classes 
    

 
 Le Faucheur et. al                                                  4 
 








 
            Requirements for Diff-Serv Traffic EngineeringNovember 2001 
 
   Suppose an IP/MPLS network supports 3 classes of traffic. The 
   network administrator wants to perform Traffic Engineering to 
   distribute the traffic load. Assume also that proportion across 
   traffic classes varies significantly depending on the 
   source/destination POPs. 
    
   With existing TE mechanisms, the proportion of traffic from each 
   class on a given link will vary depending on multiple factors 
   including: 
   - in which order the different TE-LSPs are routed 
   - the preemption priority associated with the different TE-LSPs 
   - link/node failure situations  
    
   This may make it difficult or impossible for the network 
   administrator to configure the Diff-Serv PHBs (e.g. queue bandwidth) 
   to ensure that each traffic class gets the appropriate treatment. 
   This leads again to the requirement for DS-TE to be able to enforce 
   a different bandwidth constraint for different classes of traffic. 
   This could be used to ensure that, regardless of the order in which 
   tunnels are routed, regardless of their preemption priority and 
   regardless of the failure situation, the amount of traffic of each 
   class routed over a link matches the Diff-Serv scheduler 
   configuration on that link for the corresponding class (e.g. queue 
   bandwidth). 
    
   As an illustration of how DS-TE would address this scenario, the 
   network administrator may configure the service rate of Diff-Serv 
   queues to (45%,35%,20%) for classes (1,2,3) respectively. The 
   administrator would then split the traffic into separate Traffic 
   Trunks for each class and associate a bandwidth to each LSP 
   transporting those Traffic Trunks. The network administrator may 
   also want to configure preemption priorities of each LSP in order to 
   give highest restoration priority to the highest priority class and 
   medium priority to the medium class. Then DS-TE could ensure that 
   after a failure, class 1 traffic would be rerouted with first access 
   at link capacity but without exceeding its service rate of 45% of 
   the link bandwidth. Class 2 traffic would be rerouted with second 
   access at the link capacity but without exceeding its allotment. 
   Note that where class 3 is the Best-Effort service, the requirement 
   on DS-TE may be to ensure that the total amount of traffic routed 
   across all classes does not exceed the total link capacity of 100% 
   (as opposed to separately limiting the amount of Best Effort traffic 
   to 20 even if there was little class 1 and class 2 traffic). 
    
   In this scenario, DS-TE allowed for the maintenance of a more steady 
   distribution of classes, even during rerouting. This relied on the 
   required capability of DS-TE to adjust the amount of traffic of each 
   class routed on a link based on the configuration of the scheduler 
   and the amount of bandwidth available for each class. 
    
   Alternatively, some network administrators may want to solve the 
   problem by having the scheduler dynamically adjusted based on the

            Requirements for Diff-Serv Traffic EngineeringNovember 2001 
 
   amount of bandwidth of the LSPs admitted for each class. This is an 
   additional requirement on DS-TE. 
    
2.3.    Scenario 3: Guaranteed Bandwidth Services 
    
   In addition to the Best effort service, an IP/MPLS network operator 
   may desire to offer a point-to-point "guaranteed bandwidth" service 
   whereby the provider pledges to provide a given level of performance 
   (bandwidth/delay/loss...) end-to-end through its network from an 
   ingress port to and egress port.  The goal is to ensure all 
   "guaranteed" traffic within a subscribed traffic contract, will be 
   delivered within stated tolerances.   
    
   One approach for deploying such "guaranteed" service involves: 
   - dedicating a Diff-Serv PHB (or a Diff-Serv PSC as defined in 
     [DIFF-NEW]) to the "guaranteed" traffic 
   - policing guaranteed traffic on ingress against the traffic 
     contract and marking the "guaranteed" packets with the 
     corresponding DSCP/EXP value 
    
   Where very high level of performance is targeted for the 
   "guaranteed" service, it may be necessary to ensure that the amount 
   of "guaranteed" traffic remains below a given percentage of link 
   capacity on every link. Where the proportion of "guaranteed" traffic 
   is high, constraint based routing can be used to enforce such a 
   constraint.  
    
   However, the network operator may also want to simultaneously 
   perform Traffic Engineering of the rest of the traffic (i.e. non-
   guaranteed traffic) which would require that constraint based 
   routing is also capable of enforcing a differnet bandwidth 
   constraint, which would be less stringent than the one for 
   guaranteed traffic. 
    
   Again, this combination of requirements can not be addressed with 
   existing TE mechanisms. DS-TE mechanisms allowing enforcement of a 
   different bandwidth constraint for guaranteed traffic and for non-
   guaranteed traffic are required. 
    
    
3.      Detailed Requirements for DS-TE 
    
   This section specifies the functionality that the above scenarios 
   require out of DS-TE implementations. Actual technical protocol 
   mechanisms and procedures to achieve such functionality are outside 
   the scope of this document. 
 
3.1.    DS-TE Compatibility 
 
   While DS-TE is required in a number of situations such as the ones 
   described above, it is important to keep in mind that using DS-TE 
   may impact scalability (as discussed later in this document) and 
 
 Le Faucheur et. al                                                  6 
 








 
            Requirements for Diff-Serv Traffic EngineeringNovember 2001 
 
   operational practices. DS-TE should only be used when existing TE 
   mechanisms combined with Diff-Serv cannot address the network design 
   requirements. Many network operators may choose to not use DS-TE, or 
   to only use it in a limited scope within their network.  
    
   Thus, the DS-TE solution must be developed in such a way that: 
     
    (i)    it raises no interoperability issues with existing deployed 
           TE mechanisms.  
    (ii)   it allows DS-TE deployment to the required level of 
           granularity and scope (e.g. only in a subset of the 
           topology, or only for the number of classes required in the 
           considered network) 
    
3.2.    Class-Types 
    
   The fundamental requirement for DS-TE is to be able to enforce 
   different bandwidth constraints for different sets of Traffic 
   Trunks. 
    
   [TEWG-FW] introduces the concept of Class-Types when discussing 
   operations of MPLS Traffic Engineering in a Diff-Serv environment.  
    
   DS-TE refines this definition into the following: 
    
           Class-Type (CT): the set of Traffic Trunks which share the 
           exact same Bandwidth Constraint, or set of Bandwidth 
           Constraints, on all links, for the purpose of Constraint 
           Based Routing and Admission Control. 
    
   Note that different LSPs transporting Traffic Trunks from the same 
   CT may be using the same or different preemption priorities as 
   explained in more details in section 3.4 below. 
    
   For illustration purposes, let's consider the case of a network 
   running 4 Diff-Serv classes of services respectively based on the EF 
   PHB, the AF1x PSC, the AF2x PSC and the BE PHB. The network 
   administrator may decide to deploy DS-TE in the following way: 
        o from every DS-TE Head-end to every DS-TE Tail-end, split 
          traffic into 4 Traffic Trunks: one for traffic of each Diff-
          Serv class 
        o because the QoS objectives for the AF1x Traffic Trunks and 
          for the AF2x Traffic Trunks may be of similar nature (e.g. 
          both targeting low loss albeit at different levels perhaps), 
          the same (set of) Bandwidth Constraint(s) may be applied 
          collectively over the AF1x Traffic Trunks and the AF2x 
          Traffic Trunks. Thus, the network administrator may only 
          define three CTs: one for the EF Traffic Trunks, one for the 
          AF1x and AF2x Traffic Trunks and one for the Best Effort 
          Traffic Trunks.

            Requirements for Diff-Serv Traffic EngineeringNovember 2001 
 
   DS-TE must support at least 2 CTs and up to a maximum of 8 CTs. 
   Those are referred to as CTc, 0 <= c <= MaxCT-1 = 7. 
    
   In a given network, DS-TE must not require the network administrator 
   to always deploy the maximum number of CTs. The network 
   administrator must be able to deploy only the number of CTs actually 
   utilized. 
    
3.3.    Bandwidth Constraints 
    
   We refer to a Bandwidth Constraint Model as the set of rules 
   defining: 
   - the maximum number of Bandwidth Constraints; and 
   - which CTs each Bandwidth Constraint applies to and how. 
    
   By definition of CT, each CT is assigned either a Bandwidth 
   Constraint, or a set of Bandwidth Constraints. 
    
   We refer to the Bandwidth Constraints as BCb, 0 <= b <= MaxBC-1   
    
   Different models of Bandwidth Constraints are conceivable for 
   control of the CTs. 
    
   For example, a simple model of separate Bandwidth Constraints per CT 
   could be defined. This model is defined by: 
   - MaxBC= MaxCT 
   - All LSPs supporting Traffic Trunks from CTc use no more than BCc 
    
   For illustration purposes, on a link of 100 unit of bandwidth where 
   three CTs are used, the network administrator might then configure 
   BC0=30, BC1= 50, BC3=20 such  
   - All LSPs supporting Traffic Trunks from CT0 use no more than 30 
     (e.g. Voice <= 30) 
   - All LSPs supporting Traffic Trunks from CT1 use no more than 50 
     (e.g. Premium Data <= 50) 
   - All LSPs supporting Traffic Trunks from CT2 use no more than 20 
     (e.g. Best Effort <= 20) 
    
   As another example, a "Russian Doll" model of Bandwidth Constraints 
   may be defined whereby: 
   - MaxBC= MaxCT 
   - All LSPs supporting Traffic Trunks from CTc (with 0<=c<=b) use no 
     more than BCc 
    
   For illustration purposes, on a link of 100 units of bandwidth where 
   three CTs are used, the network administrator might then configure 
   BC0=60, BC1= 80, BC3=100 such  
   - All LSPs supporting Traffic Trunks from CT0 use no more than 60 
     (e.g. Voice <= 60) 
   - All LSPs supporting Traffic Trunks from CT0 or CT1 use no more 
     than 80 (e.g. Voice + Premium Data <= 80)

   - All LSPs supporting Traffic Trunks from CT0 or CT1 or CT2 use no 
     more than 100 (e.g. Voice + Premium Data + Best Effort <= 100). 
    
   More complex Bandwidth Constraints model can also be conceived. 
   Those could involve arbitrary relationships between BCb and CTc. 
   Those could also involve additional concepts such as associating 
   minimum reserved bandwidth to a CT. 
    
   At the time of writing, it is not clear whether a single model of 
   Bandwidth Constraints is sufficient, which one it should be and how 
   flexible this model really needs to be and what are the implications 
   on the DS-TE technical solution and its implementations. 
    
   We expect that Bandwidth Constraints models will be refined as part 
   of the specification of the DSTE technical solution. 
    
3.4.    Preemption 
    
   [TEWG-FW] defines the notion of preemption and preemption priority. 
   DS-TE must retain full support of such preemption. 
    
   The preemption attribute defined in [TE-REQ] must be retained and  
   applicable across all Class Types. The preemption attributes of 
   setup priority and holding priority must retain existing semantics, 
   and in particular the preemption must operate independently of Class 
   Types. This means that if LSP1 contends with LSP2 for resources, 
   LSP1 may preempt LSP2 if LSP1 has a higher preemption priority (i.e. 
   lower numerical priority value) regardless of LSP1's OA/CT and 
   LSP2's OA/CT. 
    
   In other words, DS-TE must offer eight(8) preemption priority levels 
   to be used by an LSP, that are completely orthogonal to that any 
   other LSP's attributes (eg LSP's OA, LSP's Class Type, etc.). 
    
   Thus, DS-TE must allow two different LSPs transporting Traffic 
   Trunks of the same Class-Type to use different preemption 
   priorities, and allow the LSP with higher priority to preempt the 
   other one when they contend for resources. 
    
   Similarly, DS-TE must allow two different LSPs transporting Traffic 
   Trunks from different Class-Types to use different preemption 
   priorities, and allow the LSP with higher priority to preempt the 
   other one when they contend for resources. 
    
3.5.    Dynamic Adjustment of Diff-Serv PHBs 
    
   As discussed in section 2.2, DS-TE may support adjustment of Diff-
   Serv PHBs parameters (e.g. queue bandwidth) based on the amount of 
   TE-LSPs established for each Class/Class-Type.

            Requirements for Diff-Serv Traffic EngineeringNovember 2001 
 
   Where this behavior is supported, it must allow for disabling via 
   configuration (thus reverting to PHB treatment with static scheduler 
   configuration independent of DS-TE operations). 
    
   The dynamic adjustment must take account of the performance 
   requirements of each class when computing required adjustments. 
 
3.6.    Overbooking 
    
   Existing TE mechanisms allow overbooking to be applied on LSPs for 
   Constraint Based Routing and admission control. Historically this 
   has been achieved in TE deployment through factoring overbooking 
   ratios at the time of sizing the LSP bandwidth and/or at the time of 
   configuring the Maximum Reservable Bandwidth on links. 
    
   DS-TE must also allow overbooking and must effectively allow 
   different overbooking ratios to be enforced for different CTs. 
    
   DS-TE should optionally allow the effective overbooking ratio of a 
   given CT to be tweaked differently in different parts of the 
   network. 
    
3.7.    Restoration 
    
   With existing TE, restoration policies use standard priority 
   mechanisms such as, for example, the preemption priority to 
   effectively control the order/importance of LSPs for restoration 
   purposes. 
    
   DS-TE must ensure that similar application of the  use of standard 
   priority mechanisms for implementation of restoration policy are not 
   prevented since those are expected to be required for achieving the 
   survivability requirements of DS-TE networks. 
    
   Further discussion of restoration requirements are presented in the 
   output document of the TEWG Requirements Design Team [SURVIV-REQ]. 
    
    
4.      Solution Evaluation Criteria 
    
   A range of solutions is possible for the support of the DS-TE 
   requirements discussed above. For example, some solutions may 
   require that all current TE protocols syntax (IGP, RSVP-TE, CR-LDP) 
   be extended in various ways.  For instance, current TE protocols 
   could be modified to support multiple bandwidth constraints rather 
   than the existing single aggregate bandwidth constraint. 
   Alternatively, other solutions may keep the existing TE protocols 
   syntax unchanged but modify their semantic to allow for the multiple 
   bandwidth constraints.  
    
   This section identifies the evaluation criteria that should be used 
   to assess potential DS-TE solutions for selection.

4.1.    Satisfying detailed requirements 
    
   The solution must address all the scenarios described in section 2 
   and satisfy all the requirements listed in section 3. 
    
4.2.    Flexibility 
 
        -      number of Class Types that can be supported, compared to 
               number identified in Requirements section 
        -      number of Classes within a Class-Type 
    
    
4.3.    Extendibility 
 
        -      how far can the solution be extended in the future if 
               requirements for more Class-Types are  identified in the 
               future.  
    
4.4.    Scalability 
 
        -      impact on network scalability in what is propagated, 
               processed, stored and computed (IGP signaling, IGP 
               processing, IGP database, TE-Tunnel signaling ,...). 
        -      how does scalability impact evolve with number of Class-
               Types/Classes actually deployed in a network. In 
               particular, is it possible to keep overhead small for a 
               large networks which only use a small number of Class-
               Types/Classes, while allowing higher number of Class-
               Types/Classes in smaller networks which can bear higher 
               overhead) 
    
4.5.    Backward compatibility/Migration 
 
        -      backward compatibility/migration with/from existing TE 
               mechanisms 
        -      backward compatibility/migration when 
               increasing/decreasing the number of Class-Types actually 
               deployed in a given network. 
    
    
5.      Security Considerations 
    
   The solution developed to address the requirements defined in this 
   document must address security aspects. DS-TE is not expected to add 
   specific security requirements beyond those of Diff-Serv and 
   existing TE.  Networks which employ Diff-Serv techniques might offer 
   some protection between classes for denial of service attacks.  
   Though depending on how the technology is employed, it is possible 
   for some (lower scheduled) traffic to be more susceptible to traffic 
   anomalies (which include denial of service attacks) occurring within 
   other (higher scheduled) classes.
