Abstract

   The PANA Authentication Agent (PAA) does not necessarily act as an
   Enforcement Point (EP) to prevent unauthorized access or usage of the
   network.  When a PANA Client successfully authenticates itself to the
   PAA, EP(s) (e.g., access routers) will need to be suitably notified.
   The PANA working group mandates the use of Simple Network Management

1.  Terminology and Definitions

   PANA: Protocol for Carrying Authentication for Network Access.

   PaC (PANA Client):

      The client side of the protocol that resides in the host device,
      which is responsible for providing the credentials to prove its
      identity for network access authorization.  A PaC is responsible
      for requesting network access and engaging in authentication
      process using the PANA protocol.

   DI (Device Identifier):

      The identifier used by the network as a handle to control and
      police the network access of a client.  Depending on the access
      technology, this identifier might contain any of IP address, link-
      layer address, switch port number, etc. of a connected device.

   PAA (PANA Authentication Agent):

      The access network (server) side entity of the PANA protocol.  A
      PAA is in charge of interfacing with the PaCs for authenticating
      and authorizing them for the network access service.  To this end,
      the PAA verifies the credentials provided by a PANA client and
      grants network access service to the device associated with the
      client and identified by a DI.

      The PAA is also responsible for updating the access control state
      (i.e., filters) depending on the creation and deletion of the
      authorization state.  The PAA communicates the updated state to
      the enforcement points in the network.  When the PAA and the EP
      are separated, a protocol is required to carry the authorized
      client attributes from the PAA to the EP.  SNMP is mandated for
      this task.

   EP (Enforcement Point):

      A node on the access network where per-packet enforcement policies
      (i.e., filters) are applied on the inbound and outbound traffic of
      client devices.  The EP uses non-cryptographic or cryptographic
      filters to selectively allow and discard data packets.  These
      filters may be applied at the link-layer or the IP-layer.  An EP
      learns the attributes of the authorized clients (DI and
      (optionally) cryptographic keys) from the PAA.

   Authentication Server (AS):

      The server implementation that is in charge of verifying the
      credentials of a PaC that is requesting the network access
      service.  The AS receives requests from the PAA on behalf of the
      PaCs, and responds with the result of verification together with
      the authorization parameters (e.g., allowed bandwidth, IP
      configuration, etc).  The AS might be hosted on the same node as
      the PAA, on a dedicated node on the access network, or on a
      central server somewhere in the Internet.

2.  Introduction

2.1  PAA/EP separation context

   PANA enables access control by identifying legitimate clients and
   generating filtering information for access control mechanisms.
   [I-D.ietf-pana-framework] defines a general AAA and access control
   framework.  The PANA protocol itself provides client authentication
   and authorization functionality for securing network access.  The
   other component of a complete solution is the access control which
   ensures that only authenticated and authorized clients can gain
   access to the network.

   Access control can be achieved by placing EPs (Enforcement Points) in
   the network for policing the traffic flow.  EPs should prevent data
   traffic from and to any unauthorized client unless it's either PANA
   or one of the other allowed traffic types (e.g., ARP, IPv6 neighbor
   discovery, DHCP, etc.).

   Figure 1 below illustrates the functional entities and the interfaces
   (protocols, APIs) among them.

                                              RADIUS/

                      Figure 1: PANA Functional Model

   Some of the entities may be co-located depending on the deployment
   scenario.

   The EP on the access network allows general data traffic from any
   authorized PaC, whereas it allows only limited type of traffic (e.g.,
   PANA, DHCP, router discovery) for the unauthorized PaCs.  This
   ensures that the newly attached clients have the minimum access
   service to engage in PANA and get authorized for the unlimited
   service.

   If the PaC is authorized to gain the access to the network, the PAA
   also sends the PaC-specific attributes (e.g., IP address,
   cryptographic keys, etc.) to the EP by using SNMP.  The EP uses this



El Mghazli, et al.       Expires January 6, 2006                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft       SNMP usage for PAA-EP interface           July 2005


   information to enforce policy rules allowing data traffic from and to
   the PaC to pass through.

   In case a cryptographic access control needs to be enabled after the
   PANA authentication, a secure association protocol runs between the
   PaC and the EP.  The PaC should already have the input parameters to
   this process as a result of the successful PANA exchange.  Similarly,
   the EP should have obtained them from the PAA via SNMP.  Secure
   association exchange produces the required security associations
   between the PaC and the EP to enable per-packet protection.

   Finally data traffic can start flowing from and to the newly
   authorized PaC.

   In this document, it is assumed that PAA and EP are pre-configured to
   be able to communicate each other with a required security
   association.  In case where dynamic discovery is needed for PAA and
   EP to know each other's address, then SNMPv3 engine-id discovery
   could be used.  Such dynamic discovery is out of scope of this
   document.

2.2  Scope

   Section 3 gives references for the SNMP framework.

   Section 4 provides a general statement with regards to the
   applicability of SNMP as the PAA-EP protocol.

   IPSec configuration MIB modules were found to have general
   applicability and varying levels of re-usability for PANA EP
   authorization configuration using SNMP.  Section 5 details the
   applicability of this MIB set to the EP configuration and Section 6
   defines some additional PANA-specific objects that extend the IPSec
   SPD-MIB module [I-D.ietf-ipsp-spd-mib] in order to entirely satisfy
   the PAA-EP interface requirements.

   In the same manner, RTFM Meter MIB module was found to have general
   applicability of re-usability for PANA EP accounting configuration
   using SNMP.  Section 7 details the applicability of this MIB to the
   EP configuration.

   Finally, Section 9 addresses the security considerations.

3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58
   [RFC2578], STD 58 [RFC2579] and STD 58 [RFC2580].

4.  SNMP Applicability with the PANA framework

   This section provides a general statement with regards to the
   applicability of SNMP as the PAA-EP protocol.  This analysis of SNMP
   is specific to SNMPv3, which provides the security required for PANA
   usage.  SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c would be inappropriate for PANA since they
   have been declared Historic, and because their messages have only
   trivial security.

4.1  SNMPv3 General applicability

   The primary advantages of SNMPv3 are that it is a mature, well
   understood protocol, currently deployed in various scenarios, with
   mature toolsets available for SNMP managers and agents.

   Application intelligence is captured in MIB modules, rather than in
   the messaging protocol.  MIB modules define a data model of the
   information that can be collected and configured for a managed
   functionality.  The SNMP messaging protocol transports the data in a
   standardized format without needing to understand the semantics of
   the data being transferred.  The endpoints of the communication
   understand the semantics of the data.

   Partly due to the lack of security in SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c, and partly
   due to variations in configuration requirements across vendors, few
   MIB modules have been developed that enable standardized
   configuration of managed devices across vendors.  Since monitoring
   can be done using only a least-common-denominator subset of
   information across vendors, many MIB modules have been developed to
   provide standardized monitoring of managed devices.  As a result,
   SNMP has been used primarily for monitoring rather than for
   configuring network nodes.

   SNMPv3 builds upon the design of widely-deployed SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c
   versions.  Specifically, SNMPv3 shares the separation of data
   modeling (MIBs) from the protocol to transfer data, so all existing
   MIBs can be used with SNMPv3.  SNMPv3 also uses the SMIv2 standard,
   and it shares operations and transport with SNMPv2c.  The major
   difference between SNMPv3 and earlier versions is the addition of
   strong message security and controlled access to data.

   SNMPv3 uses the architecture detailed in [RFC3411], where all SNMP
   entities are capable of performing certain functions, such as the
   generation of requests, response to requests, the generation of
   asynchronous notifications, the receipt of notifications, and the
   proxy-forwarding of SNMP messages.  SNMP is used to read and
   manipulate virtual databases of managed-application-specific
   operational parameters and statistics, which are defined in MIB

   modules.

4.2  Compliancy of SNMP against the PANA requirements

   The following sections detail how the PAA-EP protocol requirements
   are fully supported by SNMP:

4.2.1  Authorization Consideration

   This section discusses PAA-EP communication in terms of authorization
   aspects.

   Binary Authorization:

      Filtering rules to be installed on EP generally include a device
      identifier of PaC, and also a cryptographic keying material (e.g.,
      IKE [RFC2409] pre-shared key ) when cryptographic data traffic
      protection is needed.  Each keying material is uniquely identified
      with a keying material name (e.g., ID_KEY_ID in IKE) and has a
      lifetime for key management, accounting, access control and
      security reasons in general.

      PANA authorization management can be modeled in a way that is
      consistent with existing standard MIB modules, this is detailed in
      Section 5.  Additional PANA-specific objects may be needed and are
      defined in Section 6.

   Profile-based authorization:

      In addition to the device identifier and keying material, the PAA
      may provide the EP with additional authorization information.  For
      instance, a user may be authorized to access the network within a
      given class of service or for a maximum amount of units.  The type
      of units can be time (e.g., authorization lifetime), volume (e.g.,
      the number of incoming and/or outgoing packets and/or bytes),
      service specific or money depending on the type of service event
      [I-D.ietf-aaa-diameter-cc].

      This type of authorization might also require that the
      communicating pair of PAA and EP to detect a dead or rebooted peer
      in order to avoid possible inaccurate accounting.  This aspect is
      discussed in Section 4.2.6.

      In any case, even if it is very likely to occur between the PAA
      and EP, this kind of profile-based authorization is beyond the
      scope of the PANA working group.  Hence, the specification of the
      MIB modules (existing or not) necessary to provide such policy
      information is outside the scope of the present document, which



El Mghazli, et al.       Expires January 6, 2006                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft       SNMP usage for PAA-EP interface           July 2005


      deals only with the so-called binary authorization.


4.2.2  PAA-EP relation

   A number of deployment options are envisaged within the PANA
   framework.  See [I-D.ietf-pana-framework] for further details.

   The SNMP framework [RFC3410] supports one-to-many, many-to-one, and
   many-to-many relationships between the SNMP managers (PAAs) and
   agents (EPs).

4.2.3  Secure Communication

   SNMPv3 includes the User-based Security Model (USM, [RFC3414]), which
   provides authentication, confidentiality, and integrity.

   Additionally, USM has specific built-in mechanisms for preventing
   replay attacks including unique protocol engine IDs, timers and
   counters per engine and time windows for the validity of messages.

   See [RFC3410] for the security features provided by the SNMPv3
   framework.

4.2.4  Notification of PaC presence

   The PaC may also choose to start sending packets before getting
   authenticated.  In that case, the network should detect this and the
   PAA must send an unsolicited PANA-Start-Request message to the PaC.
   The EP is the node that can detect such activity.  In case they are
   separate, there needs to be an explicit message to prompt the PAA.

   Such a presence notification is done by using the SNMP notification
   operation.  See Section 6 and Section 6.2 for details on how new and
   existing SNMP objects provide this feature.

4.2.5  Accounting Consideration

   Since authentication and authorization are closely related to
   accounting in many cases, accounting aspects need to be considered in
   the PAA-EP protocol.

   The PAA device acts as an accounting client of a AAA protocol.  The
   PAA collects accounting information from the EP(s) it controls, and
   sends the gathered data to the accounting server by using the AAA
   protocol.

   PANA accounting management is done using RTFM (Real-Time Flow



El Mghazli, et al.       Expires January 6, 2006               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft       SNMP usage for PAA-EP interface           July 2005


   Measurement) standard MIB module [RFC2720], this is detailed in
   Section 7.

   The authentication/authorization session identifier of a AAA protocol
   is used by the accounting server to associate accounting information
   with a particular authentication/authorization session to calculate
   bills.  The authentication/authorization session identifier may or
   may not be the same as the PANA session identifier and it is the
   responsibility of the PAA to organize the correlation between the
   meters/filters at the EP and the PANA/AAA sessions at the PAA.

   The communicating pair of the PAA and the EP might need to detect a
   rebooted peer to avoid possible inaccurate accounting.  This aspect
   is discussed in Section 4.2.6.

4.2.6  Peer Liveness Test and Rebooted Peer Detection

   PAA-EP protocol implementations need to be stateful, when considering
   the authorization and accounting aspects as described in the previous
   sections.  The stateful nature provides the functionality to detect a
   dead or rebooted peer in a timely fashion.  On the other hand, this
   does not mean that the PAA-EP protocol itself needs to be stateful.
   For example, an SNMP entity (i.e., an SNMP engine plus SNMP
   applications) can generate SNMP queries on a particular MIB at an
   interval short enough to perform peer liveness test and rebooted peer
   detection.

   Also, the peer liveness test and rebooted peer detection need to be
   performed securely.

   When SNMPv3 is used as the PAA-EP protocol, the SNMP management
   framework supports snmpEngineBoots MIB [RFC3411].  By periodically
   sending SNMP query to the peer to check the current value of this MIB
   with the use of SNMP Security Subsystem, it is possible for an SNMP
   entity to securely perform peer liveness test and rebooted peer
   detection between PAA and EP.

   When a PAA finds a dead or rebooted EP, the PAA should immediately
   terminate PANA sessions for PaCs that are authorized for access
   through the EP.

5.  Applicability of IPSec configuration MIBs

   This section details the applicability of existing IPSec
   configuration MIB modules to the EP configuration.  These were found
   to have general applicability and a fair level of re-usability for
   the PANA EP configuration:

   IPSec Security Policy Database (SPD) Configuration MIB:

      [I-D.ietf-ipsp-spd-mib] defines a MIB module (IPSEC-SPD-MIB) for
      configuration of an IPSec Security Policy Database (SPD).  No
      IPSec or IKE specific actions are defined within this document.

   IPSec Security Policy IKE Action MIB:

      [I-D.ietf-ipsp-ikeaction-mib] defines a MIB module (IPSEC-
      IKEACTION-MIB) for configuration of an IKE action within the IPSec
      SPD.

   IPSec Security Policy IPSec Action MIB:

      [I-D.ietf-ipsp-ipsecaction-mib] defines a MIB module (IPSEC-
      IPSECACTION-MIB) for configuring IPsec actions within the IPSec
      SPD.

   The EP enforces binary authorization by filtering data traffic on the
   basis of the Device Identifier (DI) of the PaC.  The PAA must
   provision its EPs with DI-based filters in order to control and
   police the network access of a PaC.  According to the definition of
   the Device Identifier in [RFC4058], such filters - depending on the
   access technology - might be either a IPv4/6 address or a link-layer
   address of a connected device.

   Do note also that a keying material might be provisioned.  The
   particular case where access control is performed using IPSec is
   specified in [I-D.ietf-pana-ipsec].  The configuration aspects in
   this case are detailed in Section 5.2.

5.1  General IP Access Control

   The IPSec SPD MIB module (SPD-MIB) is designed to configure an IPSec
   security policy database in a policy and rule oriented fashion.  This
   module is divided into 3 portions (Rules, Filters, Actions).
   Specifically, SPD-MIB provides a generic mechanism for performing
   packet processing based on a rule set.

   The policy-based packet filtering and the corresponding execution of
   actions is of a more general nature than for IPSec configuration



El Mghazli, et al.       Expires January 6, 2006               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft       SNMP usage for PAA-EP interface           July 2005


   only, such as for configuration of a firewall.  Rules within the
   IPSec SPD-MIB are generic and simply bind a filter to an action.
   Filters provided within the SPD-MIB itself are numerous and fairly
   complete for most common packet filtering usage but externally
   defined filters are supported.

   For Ipv4/v6 address-based filters provisioning, the DIFFSERV-MIB
   module defined in [RFC3289] provides means to filter the traffic
   based on the IP header information.  DiffServ Multi-field Classifier
   table provides such facilities: one can define the various tests that
   are used when evaluating a given IP packet.  The various tests
   definable in this table are as follows:

   o  IP source address prefix, including host, CIDR Prefix, and "any
      source address"

   o  IP destination address prefix, including host, CIDR Prefix, and
      "any destination address"

   o  IPv6 Flow ID

   o  IP protocol or "any"

   o  TCP/UDP/SCTP source port range, including "any"

   o  TCP/UDP/SCTP destination port range, including "any"

   o  Differentiated Services Code Point

   The results of each test are ANDed together to produce the result of
   the entire filter.

   The actions encapsulated within the SPD-MIB module are basic drop/
   accept actions.  These are sufficient to perform EP binary
   authorization enforcement at the EP.

   When profile-based authorization information is provided to the EP,
   more advanced actions like classifiers, meters and schedulers might
   be configured by the PAA.  This is out of the scope of the present
   document.

5.2  Network Layer Secure Access Control (IPSec)

   The PANA protocol authenticates the client and also establishes a
   PANA security association between the PANA client and PANA
   authentication agent at the end of successful authentication.  The
   PAA indicates the results of the authentication using the PANA-Bind-
   Request (PBR) message wherein it can indicate the access control

   method enforced by the access network and the IP address of the
   corresponding EP.

   When IPSec is used to perform access control, the PANA protocol
   [I-D.ietf-pana-pana] does not discuss any details of IPSec [RFC2401]
   SA establishment.  Indeed, [I-D.ietf-pana-ipsec] discusses the
   details for establishing an IPSec security association between the
   PaC and the EP.  When the IPSec SA is successfully established, it
   can be used to enforce access control and specifically used to
   prevent the service theft mentioned in [RFC4016].

   In this particular context, one assumes that the following have
   already happened before the IPSec SA is established:

   1.  PANA client (PaC) and PAA mutually authenticate each other using
       EAP methods that derive the AAA-Key [I-D.ietf-eap-keying].

   2.  PaC learns the IP address of the Enforcement point (EP) during
       the PANA exchange.

   3.  PaC learns that the network uses IPSec [RFC2401] for securing the
       link between PaC and EP during the PANA exchange (PBR message).

   4.  PaC configures an IP address address before the PANA protocol
       begins (the pre-PANA Address (PRPA), see [I-D.ietf-pana-pana]).

   The IPSec IKE Action MIB module (IKEACTION-MIB) works within the
   framework of the IPSec SPD-MIB.  It can be referenced as an action by
   the SPD-MIB and is used to configure IKE negotiations between network
   devices.  Hence, together with the SPD-MIB, the IKEACTION-MIB module
   enables the PAA to configure IPSEC-based access control at the EP.

   The PAA is then responsible to communicate to EP the following
   information before IKE phase 1 exchange begins between PaC and EP:

   The IKE pre-shared key:

      To this end, the PAA must set a row in the IKE Credential Filter
      table of the IKEACTION-MIB.  This table defines filters, which can
      be used to match credentials of IKE peers, where the credentials
      in question have been obtained from an IKE phase 1 exchange.  They
      may be X.509 certificates, Kerberos tickets, or Pre-shared keys,
      etc.

   The PRPA of the PaC:

      The DiffServ Multi-Field Classifier of the DIFFSERV-MIB is used
      for configuring the SPD in a similar manner than what is described
      in Section 5.1.

   The Key-Id and PANA session ID:

      [I-D.ietf-pana-ipsec] states that Pac and EP should use the PANA
      session ID concatenated with the AAA-key as the value of the
      ID_KEY_ID in aggressive mode for establishing the phase 1 SA.
      Section 8 details usage examples that illustrate the way the
      IKEACTION-MIB is used for this purpose.

6.  PANA extension to the IPSec SPD MIB

   Many existing MIB objects defined in the IPSec Configuration MIB
   modules can be efficiently re-used for the PANA-specific needs.  This
   is detailed in Section 5.

   The present section define additional PANA-specific objects that
   extend the IPSec SPD MIB module in order to entirely satisfy the
   PAA-EP interface requirements.

6.1  Bootstrapping link layer ciphers

   PANA can bootstrap not only network layer secure access control but
   also any type of link layer secure access control.  The following
   parameters are defined to support bootstrapping link layer secure
   access control:

   panaL2FiltPmk:

      A PMK (Pairwise Master Key) that is derived from AAA-Key and used
      as the shared secret needed for executing a secure association
      protocol between the PaC and EP in order to generate TSKs
      (Transient Session Keys) [I-D.ietf-eap-keying].  In the case of
      IEEE 802.11i [802.11i], an 802.11i PMK is carried in this MIB
      object.

   PMK Name:

      The name fo the PMK.  In the case of IEEE 802.11i, a 802.11i PMKID
      is carried in this MIB object.

   PMK Lifetime:

      The lifetime of the PMK.  The PMK must be invalidated when the PMK
      lifetime expires.  A new PMK with a new PMK lifetime may be
      installed before the lifetime of the current PMK expires.  The PMK
      lifetime may be calculated from a RADIUS Session-Timeout attribute
      or a Diameter Authorization-Lifetime AVP.

   These parameters are contained in PanaL2FilterEntry together with
   other link layer filtering parameters.

6.2  Notification of PaC presence

   The SPD-MIB provides a means to notify to the SNMP manager (PAA)
   information on packets matching/not matching the filters of given
   rule.  Such notification mechanisms and objects can be re-used for
   notifying the PAA that unauthorized packets are trying to pass

Internet-Draft       SNMP usage for PAA-EP interface           July 2005


   through the EP.

   If reliability needs to be guaranteed for the notifications
   (panaNewPacIPNotification and panaNewPacL2Notification), hence inform
   notification, which is acknowledged, MUST be used.  Then the PAA
   needs to have engine-id to be the authoritative of SNMP clock between
   EP and PAA (for inform operation the responder becomes the
   authoritative).

6.3  PANA MIB Overview

   Link-Layer filter table

      [I-D.ietf-pana-pana] says the Device-Id AVP (code 1025) is of
      Address Type [RFC3588].  The content for link-layer addresses is
      expected to be specified in specific documents that describe how
      IP operates over different link-layers.  For instance, IPv6 over
      Ethernet is described in [RFC2464].  To this end, additional
      filters are designed in the present document.  The link-layer
      filter test the L2 address (e.g.  MAC address, port, DSL line) and
      also defines a set of parameters needed for bootstrapping link-
      layer ciphering, including a PMK (Pair-wise Master Key), the PMK
      name and the PMK lifetime.  Note that the definition of this table
      does not assume the usage of any particular link-layer.

      When the MIB module definition for a particular link-layer defines
      MIB objects for the parameters specific to that link-layer, the
      link-layer specific parameters SHOULD be accessed via the PANA MIB
      using the link-layer filter table, instead of accessing them via
      the link-layer specific MIB.

   New PaC notification tables

      These tables define new notifications, which aims at satisfying
      this requirement.  It re-uses existing notification variable
      objects pre-defined in the SPD-MIB.

      The "New PaC" notifications (panaNewPacIPNotification and
      panaNewPaCL2Notification) are triggered when the the EP detects
      traffic coming from an unauthorized source.

      If the traffic detected is an IP flow, the objects sent must
      include spdIPSourceType, spdIPSourceAddress, spdIPDestinationType,
      and spdIPDestinationAddress objects to indicate the packet source
      and destination of the packet that triggered the action.
      Additionally, the spdIPInterfaceType and spdIPInterfaceAddress
      objects are included to indicate which interface the action was
      executed in association with and if the packet was inbound or

      outbound through the endpoint.  See [I-D.ietf-ipsp-spd-mib] for
      further details.

      If the traffic detected is Link-layer traffic, the objects sent
      must include the index of the interface which detected such
      traffic and potentially the L2 address source of the traffic.

7.  Applicability of RTFM Meter MIB

   RTFM provides for the measurement of network traffic flows:

   o  a method of specifying traffic flows within a network

   o  a hierarchy of devices (meters, meter readers, managers) for
      measuring the specified flows

   o  a mechanism for configuring meters and meter readers, and for
      collecting the flow data from remote meters

   RTFM provides high time resolution for flow first- and last-packet
   times.  Counters for long-duration flows may be read at intervals
   determined by a manager.  The RTFM Meter is designed so as to do as
   much data reduction work as possible, which minimizes the amount of
   data to be read and the amount of processing needed to produce useful
   reports from it.

   RTFM flow data can be used for a wide range of purposes, such as
   usage accounting, long-term recording of network usage (classified by
   IP address attributes) and real-time analysis of traffic flows at
   remote metering points.

   PANA recommends the use of the following RTFM module and architecture
   for the PAA to collect accounting information from the EP(s).  It is
   the responsability of the PAA to organise the correlation between the
   EP filters, RTFM flows, the PANA and the AAA sessions.

   RTFM Meter MIB [RFC2720] describes the SNMP Management Information
   Base for an RTFM meter, including its flow table, rule table (storing
   the meter's rulesets) and the control tables used for managing a
   meter and reading flow data from it.

   [RFC2722] defines the RTFM Architecture, giving descriptions of each
   component.  Explains how traffic flows are viewed as logical entities
   described in terms of their address-attribute values, so that each is
   defined by the attributes of its end-points.  Gives a detailed
   description of the RTFM traffic meter, with full details of how flows
   are stored in the meter's flow table, and how packets are matched in
   accordance with rules stored in a ruleset.

8.  EP Configuration Example

   Below are usage examples of the MIB modules in the PANA context.

8.1  Common setup

   The "EndPoint to Group" table is used to map policy (groupings) onto
   an endpoint (EP-ADDR is the IP address) where traffic is to pass by.
   Any policy group assigned to an endpoint is then used to control
   access to the traffic passing by it.

   So far, we define below two policy groups at the EP interface ("EP-
   SPD-IN" and "EP-SPD-OUT").

   spdEndpointToGroupTable, row 1:

   o  spdEndGroupDirection = incoming;

   o  spdEndGroupIdentType = IPv4;

   o  spdEndGroupAddress   = EP-ADDR;

   o  spdEndGroupName      = "EP-SPD-IN";

   spdEndpointToGroupTable, row 2:

   o  spdEndGroupDirection = outgoing;

   o  spdEndGroupIdentType = IPv4;

   o  spdEndGroupAddress   = EP-ADDR;

   o  spdEndGroupName      = "EP-SPD-OUT";

   Within each of the policy group defined above, we define a sub-group
   (a compound filter) dedicated to the treatment of traffic that is
   allowed prior to any configuration.  The following configuration
   illustrates the incoming allowed unprotected traffic:

   spdGroupContentsTable, row 1:

   o  spdGroupContName          = "EP-SPD-IN";

   o  spdGroupContPriority      = '10';

   o  spdGroupContFilter        = spdTrueFilterInstance;

Internet-Draft       SNMP usage for PAA-EP interface           July 2005


   o  spdGroupContComponentType = group;

   o  spdGroupContComponentName = "EP-ALLOWED-UNPROTECTED-IN";

   Within this sub-group, we define a rule (a sub-filter) dedicated to
   each allowed traffic types (namely PANA, ARP, IPv6 Neighbor
   Discovery, DHCP, etc).  The following configuration illustrates the
   case of incoming DHCP traffic:

   spdGroupContentsTable, row 2:

   o  spdGroupContName          = "EP-ALLOWED-UNPROTECTED-IN";

   o  spdGroupContPriority      = '1';

   o  spdGroupContFilter        = diffServMultiFieldClfrTable.10;

   o  spdGroupContComponentType = rule;

   o  spdGroupContComponentName = "EP-DHCP-ACCEPT-IN";

   We define the corresponding filter in the DiffServ Multi-Field
   Classifier table (DIFFSERV_MIB, [RFC3289]), which matches the DHCP
   packets:

   diffServMultiFieldClfrTable, row 10:

   o  diffServMultiFieldClfrAddrType     =  v4;

   o  diffServMultiFieldClfrSrcL4PortMin = '546' (DHCP);

   o  diffServMultiFieldClfrSrcL4PortMax = '547' (DHCP);

   o  diffServMultiFieldClfrProtocol     = '17' (UDP);

   The "Rule Defininition" table links a rule with a given action in the
   SPD action MIB.  E.g. the following entries links the filter defined
   above with the "accept" action statically defined in the SPD MIB
   (spdStaticActions.3).

   spdRuleDefinitionTable, row 1:

   o  spdRuleDefName          = "EP-DHCP-ACCEPT-IN";

   o  spdRuleDefDescription   = "Allow Incoming DHCP packets";

   o  spdRuleDefFilter        = spdTrueFilterInstance;

   o  spdRuleDefFilterNegated = false (default);

   o  spdRuleDefAction        = spdAcceptAction;


8.2  General IP-based Access Control

   In this section, we need to configure the SPD so that EP accepts IP
   packets coming from/going to the client 'PaC1'.  In the whole
   section, 'PaC1-IP@' is the IP address of 'PaC1'.

   Within the incoming policy group defined above ("EP-SPD-IN"), we
   define a rule dedicated to the treatment of packets coming from
   "PaC1" and the EP we are provisioning.

   spdGroupContentsTable, row 3:

   o  spdGroupContName          = "EP-SPD-IN";

   o  spdGroupContPriority      = '100';

   o  spdGroupContFilter        = diffServMultiFieldClfrTable.1;

   o  spdGroupContComponentType = rule;

   o  spdGroupContComponentName = "EP-PaC1-ACCEPT-IN";

   We define the filter in the DiffServ Multi-field Classifier table,
   which matches IP packets coming from the PaC:

   diffServMultiFieldClfrTable, row 1:

   o  diffServMultiFieldClfrAddrType = v4;

   o  diffServMultiFieldClfrSrcAddr  = 'PaC1-IP@';

   diffServMultiFieldClfrTable, row 2:

   o  diffServMultiFieldClfrAddrType = v4;

   o  diffServMultiFieldClfrDstAddr  = 'PaC1-IP@';

   The following entries links the two filters defined above with the

   o  spdRuleDefName          = "EP-PaC1-ACCEPT-IN";

   o  spdRuleDefDescription   = "Allow Incoming IP packets from PaC1";

   o  spdRuleDefFilter        = spdTrueFilterInstance;

   o  spdRuleDefFilterNegated = false (default);

   o  spdRuleDefAction        = spdAcceptAction;

   spdRuleDefinitionTable, row 3:

   o  spdRuleDefName          = "EP-PaC1-ACCEPT-OUT";

   o  spdRuleDefDescription   = "Allow Outgoing IP packets to PaC1";

   o  spdRuleDefFilter        = spdTrueFilterInstance;

   o  spdRuleDefFilterNegated = false (default);

   o  spdRuleDefAction        = spdAcceptAction;

   The same thing must be done for the outgoing direction and this
   results in a policy such that any packet coming from/going to the PaC
   is allowed to go through the EP (via EP-ADDR endpoint).

8.3  IPSec-based Access Control

   In this section we consider the case when IPSec is used to control
   access at the IP level.  In order to avoid many redundancies, the
   previous configuration set is still valid.  See below a usage example
   of IKEACTION-MIB and IPSECACTION-MIB.

   -- IKE Phase 1 configuration (agressive mode):

   We define a first-level filter in policy group "EP-SPD-IN" of the SPD
   MIB, using the "Group contents" table.  This filter isolates IKE
   phase 1 traffic coming to the EP on this interface:

   spdGroupContentsTable, row 4:

   o  spdGroupContName          = "EP-SPD-IN";

   o  spdGroupContPriority      = '1';

   o  spdGroupContFilter        = ipiaIkePhase1Filter;

Internet-Draft       SNMP usage for PAA-EP interface           July 2005


   o  spdGroupContComponentType = group;

   o  spdGroupContComponentName = "EP-IKE1-IN";

   Within this IKE-specific policy sub-group, we specify a second-level
   filter to apply for for the traffic coming from PaC1.

   spdGroupContentsTable, row 5:

   o  spdGroupContName          = "EP-IKE-Phase1-IN";

   o  spdGroupContPriority      = '1';

   o  spdGroupContFilter        = diffServMultiFieldClfrTable.1;

   o  spdGroupContComponentType = group;

   o  spdGroupContComponentName = "EP-IKE1-PaC1-IN";

   The diffServMultiFieldClfrTable.1 entry has been defined in the
   previous section.  Within the lattest sub-group we finally specify
   the rule to apply for the IKE traffic coming from PaC1 and matching
   the right identity (id_key_id).

   spdGroupContentsTable, row 6:

   o  spdGroupContName          = "EP-IKE1-PaC1-IN";

   o  spdGroupContPriority      = '1';

   o  spdGroupContFilter        = ipiaPeerIdentityFilterTable.1;

   o  spdGroupContComponentType = rule;

   o  spdGroupContComponentName = "PaC1-IKE1-RULE";

   The "Peer Identity Filter" table specifically informs the EP on the
   value of the idKeyId to use in IKE messages:

   ipiaPeerIdentityFilterTable, row 1:

   o  ipiaPeerIdFiltName          = "PaC1-IKE1-ID-FILTER";

   o  ipiaPeerIdFiltIdentityType  = id_Key_Id;

   o  ipiaPeerIdFiltIdentityValue = 'PANA-Session-Id|PANA-Key-Id';

   The "Rule Defininition" table links a rule with a given action in the

   IKE action MIB.  This action will be triggered upon reception at the
   EP of an IKE phase 1 packet coming from PaC1 and matching the right
   id_key_id.

   spdRuleDefinitionTable, row 4:

   o  spdRuleDefName          = "PaC1-IKE-RULE";

   o  spdRuleDefDescription   = "IPSec Access Control for PaC1";

   o  spdRuleDefFilter        = spdTrueFilterInstance;

   o  spdRuleDefFilterNegated = false (default);

   o  spdRuleDefAction        = ipiaIkeActionTable.1;

   The spdRuleDefAction attribute in the entry above points to a row in
   the ipiaIkeActionTable, defined below:

   ipiaIkeActionTable, row 1:

   o  ipiaIkeActName                 = "PaC1-IKE";

   o  ipiaIkeActParametersName       = "SA1-PaC1";

   o  ipiaIkeActThresholdDerivedKeys = '100' (default);

   o  ipiaIkeActExchangeMode         = aggressive;

   o  ipiaIkeActAgressiveModeGroupId = 'xxx' (Diffie-Hellman values);

   o  ipiaIkeActIdentityType         = id_Key_Id;

   o  ipiaIkeActIdentityContext      = "PANA";

   o  ipiaIkeActPeerName             = "PaC1";

   The following entry links together the "PaC1" identity with the
   corresponding credentials table entry:

   ipiaIkeIdentityTable, row 1:

   o  spdEndGroupIdentType      = IPv4;

   o  spdEndGroupAddress        = 'EP-ADDR';

   o  ipiaIkeActIdentityType    = id_Key_Id;

   o  ipiaIkeActIdentityContext = 'PANA';

   o  ipiaIkeIdCredentialName   = "PaC1-PSK";

   Finally, the pre-shared key derivated at the PAA is set in the IPSA
   Credentials table (IPSECACTION-MIB):

   ipsaCredentialTable, row 1:

   o  ipsaCredName = "PaC1-PSK";

   o  ipsaCredType = sharedSecret;

   o  ipsaCredCredential = 'PSK-derived-at-the-PAA';

   o  ipsaCredSize = 'xxx';

   o  ipsaMgnName = "xxx";

   o  ipsaRemoteID = 'PaC1';

   The Ike Action entry (above) is indexed by a name (ipiaIkeActName
   attribute), which is used as the primary index into the
   ipiaIkeActionProposalsTable.  The secondary index is a priority,
   which allows ordering of the proposals that will be sent to the peer
   (or accepted from the peer).

   ipiaIkeActionProposalsTable, row 1:

   o  ipiaIkeActPropName     = "PaC1-IKE-PROP1";

   o  ipiaIkeActPropPriority = '1';

   The ipiaIkeActPropName points to a row in the ipiaIkeProposalsTable,
   which contains the actual IKE parameters for the Phase 1 exchanges:

   ipiaIkeProposalsTable, row 1:

   o  ipiaIkeActPropName              = "PaC1-IKE-PROP1";

   o  ipiaIkePropLifetimeDerivedKeys  = xxx;

   o  ipiaIkePropCipherAlgorithm      = 3DES;

   o  ipiaIkePropCipherKeyLength      = xxx;

   o  ipiaIkePropHashAlgorithm        = HMAC-SHA1;

   o  ipiaIkePropPrfAlgorithm         = xxx;

   o  ipiaIkePropVendorId             = xxx;

   o  ipiaIkePropDhGroup              = 2;

   o  ipiaIkePropAuthenticationMethod = xxx;

   o  ipiaIkePropMaxLifetimeSecs      = xxx;

   o  ipiaIkePropMaxLifetimeKB        = xxx;

   There is a similar hierarchy for the proposals, which are used for
   Phase 2 negotiations, and result in a Phase 2 SA being created, upon
   successful negotiations.  The parameters would be set up in the
   ipiaIpsecActionTable, ipiaIpsecProposalsTable and
   ipiaIpsecTransformsTable, along with the necessary related tables.
   One would then need a rule to trigger the row in the
   ipiaIpsecActionTable.  See for further details on the IPSP MIBs
   usage.

8.4  Link-layer Access control

   The section below gives a usage example of the PANA module in the
   general L2-based access control case.

   The example below assumes the configuration set detailed in
   Section 8.1 is valid.  Here we need to configure the SPD so that EP
   accepts accepts 802 packets coming from/going to the client 'PaC1'?
   In the whole section 'PaC1-MAC@' is the MAC address of 'PaC1'.

   Within the incoming policy group defined above ("EP-SPD-IN"), we
   define a rule dedicated to the treatment of packets coming from
   "PaC1" and the EP we are provisioning.

   spdGroupContentsTable, row 3:

   o  spdGroupContName          = "EP-SPD-IN";

   o  spdGroupContPriority      = '101';

   o  spdGroupContFilter        = panaL2FilterTable.1;

   o  spdGroupContComponentType = rule;

   o  spdGroupContComponentName = "EP-PaC1-ACCEPT-IN-L2";

   We define the filter in the Link-layer filter table, which matches L2

   packets coming from the PaC to interface #5, which a 802.11
   interface:

   panaL2FilterTable, row 1:

   o  panaL2FiltEpIfIndex   = 5;

   o  panaL2FiltAddr        = "00-11-0A-80-4A-58";

   o  panaL2FiltPmk         = "...";

   o  panaL2FiltPmkName     = "...";

   o  panaL2FiltPmkLifetime = 10800;

   The following entries links the filter defined above with the
   "accept" action.

   spdRuleDefinitionTable, row 20:

   o  spdRuleDefName          = "EP-PaC1-ACCEPT-IN-L2";

   o  spdRuleDefDescription   = "Allow Incoming L2 packets from PaC1 via
      Interface #5";

   o  spdRuleDefFilter        = spdTrueFilterInstance;

   o  spdRuleDefFilterNegated = false (default);

   o  spdRuleDefAction        = spdAcceptAction;

   The same thing must be done for the outgoing direction and this
   results in a policy such that any packet coming from/going to the PaC
   is allowed to go through the EP.

9.  Security Considerations

   The MIB defined in the present document relates to a system which
   will provide network access.  As such, improper manipulation of the
   objects represented by this MIB may result in denial of service to a
   large number of end-users.  In addition, manipulation of the
   panaL2FilterTable and diffServMultiFieldClfrTable may allow an end-
   user to gain network access, spoof their IP addresses, change the
   authorized device identifiers, or affect other end-users in either a
   positive or negative manner.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  The use of panaL2FilterTable to specify which Link-layer addresses
      are authorized to access the network on which interface is
      considered to be only limited protection and does not protect
      against attacks which spoof the management station's IP address.
      The use of SNMPv3 security is mandated.  Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM
      and USM MUST be used with any v3 agent which implements this MIB.

   As described in Section 2.1, it is assumed that PAA and EP are pre-
   configured to be able to communicate each other with a required
   security association.  The pre-configured SNMP user passphrase for
   the security association between PAA and EP should not be used for a
   long term and should be updated at a reasonable frequency.

   It might be sufficient to use the same SNMP user identity and
   passphrase for all EPs controlled by the same PAA (the same thing can
   apply even when the EPs are controlled by multiple PAAs.)  Note that
   even if the same SNMP user identity and passphrase for all EPs are
   used, the different SNMP authentication and encryption keys are
   derived for each EP, because the combination of SNMP user identity
   and engine-id is used for deriving the keys.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),

Internet-Draft       SNMP usage for PAA-EP interface           July 2005


   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
