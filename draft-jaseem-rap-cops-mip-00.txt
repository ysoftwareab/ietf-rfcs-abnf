Abstract.   
         

   Mobile IP is a protocol that is used to achieve transparent routing 
   of IP packets to a mobile node. A mobile node obtains a care-of-
   address in the foreign network and registers that address with the 
   home agent. The home agent as well as the foreign agent can apply 
   policies to the mobile node registration. This draft defines COPS 
   [1] usage for Mobile IPv4 [2]. It describes how COPS is used to 
   control Mobile IP registration based on policies. It defines the 
   interactions between the PEP and the PDP to handle Mobile IP 
   registration messages. It also provides a guideline for mobility 
   agents on how to use this COPS client with regards to the 
   registration messages.

1. Introduction 
 

   Mobile IP [2,4] is a protocol that is used to achieve transparent 
   routing of IP packets to a mobile node. An MN has a permanent IP 
   address called home address in its home network. A router in the 
   home sub-net serves as Home Agent (HA) for the MN. When the MN moves 
   from the home network to a foreign network, it obtains a care-of 
   address (CoA) from the foreign network. The CoA may be one of the 
   addresses of the router serving as the Foreign Agent (FA), called 
   the foreign agent CoA, or a co-located CoA. The co-located CoA is a 
   local address that is assigned to MN in a foreign network, which is 
   routable in the IP network. The protocol provides a registration 
   mechanism that is used by MN to register with HA the new CoA. Then, 
   the HA intercepts the data packets destined for the MN's home 
   address, and forward them through an IP tunnel to the CoA. In case 
   of foreign agent CoA, the FA serves as the endpoint of the tunnel, 
   and forwards the packets received from the HA to the MN. If the CoA 
   is a co-located CoA, then the MN is the endpoint of the tunnel, 
   which decapsulates packets received from the HA through the tunnel. 
   The Mobile IP registration involves exchange of Registration Request 
   and Reply messages. The registration can happen through FA. The MN 
   sends Registration Request to the FA, which then relays it to the 
   HA. The Reply comes back from the HA to the FA, which then relays it 
   to the MN. 
    
   Before registering CoA, the MN discovers a router in the foreign 
   network to get connectivity to the IP network. The router may also 
   serve as FA. The discovery involves exchange of Agent Solicitation 
   and Agent Advertisement messages between the MN and the FA. The FA 
   advertises the set of care-of addresses through the Agent 
   Advertisement message. The MN picks one of the care-of addresses and

   register that with the HA. In case of co-located CoA, MN can 
   register that address directly with the HA. Alternatively, the FA 
   can force MN to register its co-located CoA via the FA by setting up 
   R bit in the Agent Advertisement message. 
    
   The Mobile IP registration request message shows the MN's intent to 
   become a registered node and get IP connectivity in the foreign 
   network. In case of the foreign agent CoA, the FA should serve as 
   the endpoint of HA-FA tunnel, and forward the packets received from 
   the HA to the MN. The registration reply grants the MN the status of 
   a registered node. The registration in a network domain can be 
   subjected to policies defined in that domain. For example, before 
   relaying a Registration Request to the HA, and then the Registration 
   Reply to the MN, the FA may apply policies defined for the mobile 
   user. Similarly, before responding to the Registration Request, the 
   HA may apply policies for user roaming within the foreign domain. 
   Figure 1 illustrates policy framework for Mobile IP.

   policies. It brings the registration process under the policy 
   framework. It defines the interactions between the PEP and the PDP, 
   and also provides a guideline for HA and FA to enforce policies with 
   regards to the registration messages. 
    
2. COPS Specific Object Formats 
    
   This section defines the format of COPS objects that are specific to 
   the COPS-MIP client. 
    
2.1 Common Header, client-type 
    
   client-type is COPS-MIP (TBD) 
    
2.2 Context Object (Context) 
    
        C-num = 2, C-Type = 1 
    
           0                1               2                 3  
      +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+  
      |             R-Type            |             M-Type            |  
      +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+  
      
   R-Type (Request Type Flag) 
    
        0x01 = Incoming-Message request: A MIP message is received 
        0x04 = Outgoing-Message request: Relaying a MIP message 
    
   M-Type 
    
        0x01 = Registration request 
        0x02 = Registration reply 
    
2.3 COPS-MIP Objects 
    
   We define new objects for COPS-MIP. These objects are used within 
   Client Specific Information, Client Specific Decision data, and 
   Replacement data objects. The following common format is defined for 
   these objects: 
 
           0                1               2                 3  
      +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+  
      |             Length            |     S-Num     |     S-Type    |  
      +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+  
      |                             Value ...                         |  
      +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+  
    
   The S-Num field defines the general purpose of the object, and S-
   Type defines the subtype within the object type. Length is a two-
   octet value that indicates the length in octets of the object 
   including the header. If the size of the object does not fall on a 
   32-bit word boundary, padding MUST be added to the end of the object

   so that it is aligned to the next 32-bit boundary before the object 
   can be sent on the wire. The padding MUST be all-zero values.  
    
2.3.1 Fixed-length Portion Object (FLO) for the Registration Request 
    
   This object contains the fixed-length portion of the Registration 
   request (24 octets). 
    
        S-Num = 1, S-Type = 1,  Fixed-length portion of the 
                                Registration request 
    
2.3.2 Fixed-length Portion Object (FLO) for the Registration Reply 
 
   This object contains the fixed-length portion of a registration 
   reply (20 octets). 
    
        S-Num = 1, S-Type = 3,  Fixed-length portion of registration 
                                Reply 
 

2.3.3 Extensions Object 
    
   This object is used to carry a list of extensions extracted from the 
   Mobile IP registration messages. The list includes non-
   authentication extensions and authentication extensions. 
    
        S-Num = 2, S-Type = 1, (List of registration extensions) 
    
           0                1               2                 3  
      +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+  
      |             Length            |   S-Num = 2   |    S-Type=1   |  
      +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+  
      |                         List of Extensions ...                |  
      +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+  
    

2.3.4 Extension Specific Errors Object 
    
   This object is used to indicate extension specific errors.  
    
    
        S-Num = 3, S-Type = 1 (Registration message discarded) 
    
           0                1               2                 3  
      +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+  
      |             Length            |   S-Num = 3   |  S-Type = 1   |  
      +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+  
    
   When S-Type is equal to 1, the object indicates that the PDP has 
   encountered an extension of type within the range 0-127 that it does 
   not recognize. 
    
    
        S-Num = 3, S-Type = 2 (List of extensions not recognized)

      +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+  
    
   When S-Type is equal to 2, the object contains a list of extension 
   types within the range 128-255 that the PDP has encountered but does 
   not recognize. 
    
    
2.3.5 Error Specific Data Object 
    
   This object contains error specific information. It is used in 
   decision objects. The S-Type field indicates the error code. The ESV 
   (Error Specific Value) field, only required for some error types, 
   carries error specific information. 
    
        S-Num = 3, Error Specific Data 
    
           0                1               2                 3

      |                             ESV ...                           |  
      +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+  
    
   This object is primarily used by the PDP to supply error code to PEP 
   for the outgoing registration reply message. The PDP sends this 
   object in a replacement data object (see section 2.5.1.) The S-Type 
   field maps to the error code defined for the reply message. The 
   error code values that are used in the S-Type are reproduced from 
   [4] in the following: 
 
    
   Registration denied by the foreign agent: 
    
        S-Type = 64, reason unspecified (No ESV) 
        S-Type = 65, administratively prohibited (No ESV) 
        S-Type = 67, mobile node failed authentication (No ESV) 
        S-Type = 68, home agent failed authentication (No ESV) 
        S-Type = 69, requested Lifetime too long. New registration  
                     lifetime is provided in the ESV field 
    
   Registration denied by the home agent: 
    
        S-Type = 128, reason unspecified (No ESV) 
        S-Type = 129, administratively prohibited (No ESV) 
        S-Type = 131, mobile node failed authentication (No ESV) 
        S-Type = 132, foreign agent failed authentication (No ESV) 
        S-Type = 133, registration Identification mismatch. New value

                      for identification is provided in the ESV field 
        S-Type = 135, too many simultaneous mobility bindings (No ESV) 
    
2.4 Client Specific Information (ClientSI) 
 

   Signaled ClientSI contains COPS-MIP objects defined in Section 2.3. 
 

2.5 Decision Object 
    
   The decision message contains replacement data and client specific 
   decision data objects, which encapsulate COPS-MIP objects. 
 
   Install, Remove and NULL decision commands are applicable for this 
   usage. Install indicates a positive decision, and Remove a negative 
   decision. The interpretation of Install and Remove commands is as 
   the following: 
    
   Context:                     Install                 Remove 
    
   Incoming/outgoing message    proceed with            Abort the 
   (Registration Request)       the registration        registration 
                                                        and send back 
                                                        a Reply 
 
   Incoming/outgoing message    proceed with            Abort the 
   (Registration Reply)         the registration        registration 
 
    
   In case of denying the registration, the PDP may send within the 
   decision error information to the PEP that it includes in its reply 
   message. The trigger flag if set in the decision flags object, 
   indicates to the PEP to generate a registration reply message with 
   the error code supplied in the replacement data object that is 
   discussed in section 2.5.1 
    
    
2.5.1 Replacement Data object 
    
   The Replacement Data object is used in decision messages to carry 
   two types of COPS-MIP objects: Error Specific Data objects and 
   Extension objects. The semantics of Replacement is either "insert" 
   or "replace".  
    
   The PDP may send replacement data to the PEP in order for the later 
   to replace some or all of the data in the outgoing message; e.g., it 
   provides new "lifetime" for the registration reply message in case 
   of error. It may also supply extensions to be inserted in the 
   outgoing message; e.g., it may provide a FA-HA authentication 
   extension for the registration request. 
    
   When the PEP receives a decision with an ESD as a replacement data, 
   the S-Type indicates the data in the outgoing message that needs to 
   be replaced. For example, code 63 indicates that the ESV denotes the

   registration lifetime that should replace the original lifetime in 
   the registration reply.   
    
   The PDP may also send a FA-HA authentication extension as a 
   replacement data to the FPEP responding to a decision request for an 
   outgoing registration request. Since the extension is missing in the 
   registration request, the FPEP appends it to the registration 
   request before relaying it to the HA. 
    
    
3. COPS-MIP Operations 
    
3.1 Request (REQ) 
    
   The PEP solicits policy decisions from the PDP for incoming and 
   outgoing registration messages. When a mobility agent receives a 
   registration request from an MN, the PEP encapsulates the data 
   extracted from the message into COPS-MIP objects, and sends them as 
   a ClientSI in a request to the PDP.  
    
   The request MUST include the fixed-length portion of the 
   registration message. It MUST include all the non-authentication 
   extensions that mobility agent is required to process [2,4]. The 
   extensions SHOULD be in the same order as they appeared in the 
   registration message. The PEP MAY include the authentication 
   extensions in the request. See section 4 for the details of handling 
   authentication extensions. 
    
    
   If the PDP does not recognize any extension of type whose value is 
   within the range [0-127], it MUST NOT process the message and SHOULD 
   respond with a NULL decision message that contains an Extension 
   Specific Error with S-Type = 1. The PEP MAY make local decision, and 
   if it does so, it MUST process all the extensions. 
    
   If the PDP does not recognize any extension of type whose value is 
   within the range [128-255], it ignores the unrecognized extensions, 
   and MUST process the rest of the message. It MUST include in the 
   decision message an Extension Specific Error object (S-Type=2) 
   containing list of unrecognized extension types. In this case, the 
   PEP MAY make local decisions for those extensions listed in the 
   error object. Local decisions MUST NOT be in conflict with the 
   decisions made by the PDP. 
    
   The PEP SHOULD also include the IN-interface and OUT-interface, 
   indicating the interface through which the registration message 
   arrived and the interface through which the registration message 
   would be relayed, respectively.

                     <OUT-interface> 
                     <ClientSI> 
    
        <ClientSI> := <COPS-MIP: Fixed-length portion> 
                     *[<COPS-MIP: Non-authentication extension>] 
                      [<COPS-MIP: Authentication extension>] 
    
   Multiple context flags may be set in a single REQ message. When 
   multiple flags are set, the Client SI objects are interpreted in all 
   the contexts. 
     
3.2 Decision (DEC) 
 
   The PDP sends a solicited decision message in response to a 
   registration request. The PDP sends policy decisions to notify the 
   PEP whether it should proceed with the registration or abort it. 
   Depending on the situation, the PDP may include MIP specific 
   information in the decision message for the PEP to use while 
   handling the registration. When the PDP requires the PEP to generate 
   a registration reply message, it MUST set the trigger flag in the 
   decision object. 
    
   In the case of a positive decision, the PDP sends Install command to 
   the PEP to proceed normally with the registration. For the FPEP, 
   this means that the registration is accepted, and the FA is allowed 
   to relay the registration request to the HA. The PDP may send 
   authentication extensions in a replacement object for the PEP to 
   insert in the outgoing registration request message. The PDP SHOULD 
   NOT set the trigger flag when it sends an INSTALL decision to FPEP. 
   If the trigger flag is set, then the HPEP SHOULD generate a positive 
   Registration reply.  
    
   When the registration is denied, the PDP sends a decision with a 
   Remove command, and includes an ESD as a replacement data object for 
   the PEP to insert in the registration reply message. For example, 
   the ESD may contain a new Registration lifetime, if the lifetime in 
   the registration request is longer than what is permissible. If the 
   trigger flag is set for a Remove decision, the error code MUST be 
   supplied in an error specific data object, which is encapsulated in 
   the replacement data object. 
    
        <Decision> := <Common header> 
                      <Client handle> 
                      *<Decision> 
    
        <Decision> := <Context: incoming, outgoing> 
                      <Decision: Install/Remove> 
                     [ <Decision: Replacement Data> 
                     | <Decision: Client specific decision data> ]

   Typically, the PDP responds with the same decision in all the 
   contexts for which the decision is solicited. Hence, it can set 
   multiple context flags in a decision message. In this case 
   additional data provided with the decision are interpreted under all 
   the contexts. If decisions for different contexts contain separate 
   additional data, then the decisions MUST be sent in separate 
   contexts.  
    
3.3 Delete Request State (DRQ) 
    
   Typically, the PEP sends DRQ to the PDP when the mobility agent 
   receives a deregistration request from MN. 
    
   The COPS-MIP client SHOULD send DRQ to PDP before deleting a pending 
   Registration Request and sending out Registration Reply with Error.  
    
3.4 Report (RPT) 
    
   The COPS-MIP responds to the PDP decisions with COPS specified 
   reports. 
    
4. Handling MIP authentication extensions 
    
   If the PDP is delegated to perform authentication, the PEP MUST send 
   the FLO for the registration message followed by an extension 
   object, all encapsulated in a client SI object. The extension object 
   MUST contain all extensions including the authentication extension 
   that the PDP is required to process, in the order they appear in the 
   message. See section 3.5 in [4] for the ordering and processing 
   requirements of authentication extensions, and [5] for AAA 
   requirements. If an authentication fails, the PDP is required to 
   include the appropriate authentication failure code in the decision 
   message. 
 
5. Foreign Agent Consideration 
    
   The FA performs validity checks on the registration message before 
   soliciting any decision from the PDP for that message. The FPEP 
   solicits decisions from the PDP for incoming Registration Request 
   messages using the combined context <Incoming, Outgoing>. It sends 
   all the FA related non-authentication extensions in the Registration 
   Request to the PDP. It also sends those HA related non-
   authentication extensions to the PDP that are used in FPDP decision. 
   If it receives in a PDP decision any HA related non-authentication 
   extensions, it inserts them into the Registration Request before 
   relaying the message to the HA. Although typically the PDP sends a 
   single decision in the combined context, it may send different 
   optional decision objects using different contexts. Hence, the FA 
   should solicit decision in both contexts. For example, if the PDP is 
   playing the role of the authentication authority, then it sends 
   decisions with FA-HA authentication extension in the outgoing 
   context only.

   In a COPS request for Registration Reply, the FA sends all the FA 
   related non-authentication extensions to the PDP. If it receives any 
   MN related non-authentication extension in a PDP decision, it 
   inserts them into the Registration Reply before relaying the message 
   to the MN. When the FA receives a Registration Reply from the HA 
   with zero lifetime, it sends DRQ to the PDP to delete the request 
   state(s) installed for that registration.  
    
6. Home Agent Consideration 
 

   When a HA receives a Registration Request, it solicits decisions 
   using Incoming context. It sends all the non-authentication 
   extensions from the Registration Request to the PDP. If the PDP 
   replies with a decision that includes any FA or MN related non-
   authentication extension, the HPEP inserts them into the 
   Registration Reply before sending it out.  
 
   The PDP sets the trigger flag in the decision flags object of its 
   response to the HPEP in order for the later to send the Registration 
   reply. If the decision command is INSTALL, then it indicates that 
   the HPEP should send out a Registry Reply message accepting the 
   request. Otherwise, if the decision is REMOVE then the HPEP returns 
   a negative Registration Reply message with the error code. If HA has 
   installed a single request state in PDP corresponding to a mobility 
   binding, then it should send DRQ to PDP to delete the request state 
   before deleting the mobility binding from its mobility-binding list. 
    
7. COPS State Consideration 
    
   The PEP can create one state per mobility binding. Therefore, the 
   PEP should use the same handle in its request messages to the PDP 
   for the registration requests and replies related to the same 
   binding. When a mobility binding is removed from the binding list, 
   the PEP should delete the corresponding state. Thus, only one state 
   per binding is maintained. In case of simultaneous bindings, the 
   HPEP creates as many states as the number of simultaneous bindings. 
 
 

8. Applicability/Optimization  
    
   The Mobile IP registration process should keep the registration 
   latency low, to minimize the effects of packet drops belonging to IP 
   sessions between MN and CNs that are active during the registration 
   time. The PEP-PDP interaction may contribute significantly to the 
   overall registration latency. Therefore, the PEP should reduce the 
   amount of interactions with the PDP. This warrants fewer decisions 
   solicited by the PEP, and less number of installed states.  
    
   - The PEP should try to cache decisions and policies locally and 
   make local decisions whenever possible. As long as local decisions 
   are effectively driven by the global policies, there is no real need 
   to seek their validations from PDP. For example, local decisions 
   based on configuration need no validation from the PDP.

   - When a mobile sends a registration request to refresh registration 
   after the lifetime of the previous registration request expires, the 
   HPEP can use locally cached decisions to handle the registration. 
   However, if the PDP is delegated to perform authentication, then the 
   PEP is required to solicit decisions even for refresh registration 
   messages. 
    
   - Likewise, the FA can use locally cached decisions to handle 
   refresh registration requests and replies, as long as the FPDP does 
   not perform authentication. 
 
    
9. IANA Considerations 
    
   The S-Type values for the Error Specific Data Object (S-Num = 4) 
   defined in section 2.3.5 are error codes taken from [4]. 
    
   The extension types used in the Extension List Object defined in 
   section 2.3.4 are values defined in [4]. 
    
10. Security Considerations 
    
   This document introduces no new security concerns other than those 
   discussed in [1] and [2,4]. It relies on COPS for the integrity of 
   messages and security between PEP and PDP. The mobility agent should 
   follow the security guidelines provided in Section 5 of [2,4].
