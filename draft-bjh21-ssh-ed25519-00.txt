1.  Introduction

   Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC4251] is a secure remote-login protocol.  It
   provides for an extensible variety of public key algorithms for
   identifying servers and users to one another.  Ed25519
   [I-D.josefsson-eddsa-ed25519] is a digital signature system.
   OpenSSH 6.5 [OpenSSH-6.5] introduced support for using Ed25519 for
   server and user authentication.  This document describes the method
   implemented by OpenSSH and formalizes its use of the name "ssh-
   ed25519".

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The descriptions of key and signature formats use the notation
   introduced in [RFC4251] section 3 and the string data type from
   [RFC4251] section 5.

3.  Public Key Algorithm

   This document describes a public key algorithm for use with SSH in
   accordance with [RFC4253] section 6.6.  The name of the algorithm is
   "ssh-ed25519".  This algorithm only supports signing and not
   encryption.

4.  Public Key Format

   The "ssh-ed25519" key format has the following encoding:

      string    "ssh-ed25519"
      string    key

   Here 'key' is the 32-octet public key described by
   [I-D.josefsson-eddsa-ed25519] section 5.5.

5.  Signature Algorithm

   Signatures are generated according to the procedure in
   [I-D.josefsson-eddsa-ed25519] section 5.6.

6.  Signature format

   The corresponding signature format is:

      string    "ssh-ed25519"
      string    signature

Internet-Draft               Ed25519 for SSH                   June 2015


   Here 'signature' is the 64-octet signature produced in accordance
   with [I-D.josefsson-eddsa-ed25519], Section 5.6.

7.  Verification Algorithm

   Signatures are verified according to the procedure in
   [I-D.josefsson-eddsa-ed25519], Section 5.7.

8.  SSHFP DNS resource records

   The generation of SSHFP resource records for "ssh-ed25519" keys is
   described in [RFC7479].

9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign the Public Key Algorithm name "ssh-
   ed25519" in accordance with [RFC4250], Section 4.11.3:

   Public Key Algorithm Name  Reference
   -------------------------  ---------
   ssh-ed25519                [RFCXXXX]

   [TO BE REMOVED: This registration should take place at the following
   location: <http://www.iana.org/assignments/ssh-parameters/ssh-
   parameters.xhtml#ssh-parameters-19>]

10.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in section 9 of [RFC4251] apply to all
   SSH implementations, including those using Ed25519.

   The security considerations in section 9 of
   [I-D.josefsson-eddsa-ed25519] apply to all uses of Ed25519, including
   those in SSH.

11.  Acknowledgements

   The OpenSSH implementation of Ed25519 in SSH was written by Markus
   Friedl.
