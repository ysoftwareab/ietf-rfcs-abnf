   to RFC4271 in order to remove the ATOMIC_AGGREGATE attribute.

          f) ATOMIC_AGGREGATE (Type Code 6)

             ATOMIC_AGGREGATE is a well-known discretionary attribute of
             length 0.

             Usage of this attribute is defined in 5.1.6.

3.  Changes to Section 5 - Path Attributes

   1: Section 5.0 should have the following changes (p. 24)

   Old:

                    attribute           EBGP                    IBGP
            ORIGIN             mandatory               mandatory
            AS_PATH            mandatory               mandatory
            NEXT_HOP           mandatory               mandatory

            LOCAL_PREF         see Section 5.1.5       required
            ATOMIC_AGGREGATE   see Section 5.1.6 and 9.1.4
            AGGREGATOR         discretionary           discretionary

   New:

                    attribute           EBGP                    IBGP
            ORIGIN             mandatory               mandatory
            AS_PATH            mandatory               mandatory
            NEXT_HOP           mandatory               mandatory
            MULTI_EXIT_DISC    discretionary           discretionary

4.  Changes to Section 9

4.1.  Changes to section 9.1.4

   3: Changes to section 9.1.4

   Old:

   If a BGP speaker chooses to aggregate, then it SHOULD either include
   all ASes used to form the aggregate in an AS_SET, or add the
   ATOMIC_AGGREGATE attribute to the route.

   New

Internet-Draft         Deprecate Atomic Aggregate             March 2017


   If a BGP speaker chooses to aggregate, then it SHOULD either include
   all ASes used to form the aggregate in an AS_SET.

   delete the following text:

   "In particular, a route that carries the ATOMIC_AGGREGATE attribute
   MUST NOT be de-aggregated."

4.2.  Section 9.2 Changes

   Text to delete:

               ATOMIC_AGGREGATE:
            If at least one of the routes to be aggregated has
            ATOMIC_AGGREGATE path attribute, then the aggregated route
            SHALL have this attribute as well.

5.  Operational Considerations

   Input needed here.

6.  Error Handling

   An ATOMIC_AGGREGATE attribute received should be silently ignored.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA Is asked to deprecate the BGP Attribute: Atomic_Aggregate with
   this document as reference.

8.  Security Considerations

   Deprecating a BGP attribute does not change the BGP messages sent on
   over a secure transport.

   Users of this mechanism should be aware that unless a transport that
   provides integrity (such as TCP-AO [RFC5925]) is used for the BGP
   session in question, BGP Attributes can be forged.  This could become
   an attack vector.

   Unless a transport that provides confidentiality (such as IPSec
   [RFC4303]) is used, BGP attributes Communication messages could be
   snooped by an attacker allowing access to BGP attributes.  These
   issues are common to any BGP message but may be of greater interest
   in the context of this proposal since a BGP Attribute is being
   deleted.
