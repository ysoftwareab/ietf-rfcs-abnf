1.  Introduction

   JMAP ([RFC8620] - JSON Meta Application Protocol) is a generic
   protocol for synchronising data, such as mail, calendars or contacts,
   between a client and a server.  It is optimised for mobile and web
   environments, and aims to provide a consistent interface to different
   data types.

   MDN are defined in [RFC8098] and are used as "read receipts",
   "acknowledgements", or "receipt notifications".

   A client can have to deal with MDN in different ways:

   1.  When receiving an email, an MDN can be sent to the sender.  This
       specification defines an MDN/set method to cover this case.

   2.  When sending an email, an MDN can be requested.  This must be
       done with the help of a header, and is already specified by
       [RFC8098] and can already be handled by [I-D.ietf-jmap-mail] this
       way.

   3.  When receiving an MDN, the MDN could be related to an existing
       sent mail.  This is already covered by [I-D.ietf-jmap-mail] in
       the EmailSubmission object.  Client could want to display
       detailed information about a received MDN.  This specification
       defines a MDN/parse method to cover this case.

1.1.  Notational conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Type signatures, examples and property descriptions in this document
   follow the conventions established in section 1.1 of [RFC8620].  Data
   types defined in the core specification are also used in this
   document.

   Servers MUST support all properties specified for the new data types
   defined in this document.

1.2.  Terminology

   The same terminology is used in this document as in the core JMAP
   specification.

1.3.  Addition to the capabilities object

   The capabilities object is returned as part of the standard JMAP
   Session object; see the JMAP spec.  Servers supporting _this_
   specification MUST add a property called "urn:ietf:params:jmap:mdn"
   to the capabilities object.

2.  MDN

   An *MDN* object has the following properties:

   o  *forEmailId*: "String" Email Id of the received email this MDN is
      relative to.

   o  *subject*: "String|null" Subject used as "Subject" header for this
      MDN.

   o  *textBody*: "String|null" Human readable part of the MDN, as plain
      text.

   o  *reportingUA*: "String|null" Name of the MUA creating this MDN.
      It is used to build the MDN Report part of the MDN.

   o  *disposition*: "Disposition" Object containing the diverse MDN
      disposition options.

Internet-Draft              JMAP MDN handling                  July 2019


   o  *mdnGateway*: "String|null" (server-set) Name of the gateway or
      MTA that translated a foreign (non-Internet) message disposition
      notification into this MDN.

   o  *originalRecipient*: "String|null" (server-set) Original recipient
      address as specified by the sender of the message for which the
      MDN is being issued.

   o  *finalRecipient*: "String" (server-set) Recipient for which the
      MDN is being issued.

   o  *originalMessageID*: "String|null" (server-set) Message-ID (the
      [RFC5322] header field, not the JMAP Id) of the message for which
      the MDN is being issued.

   o  *error*: "String[]|null" (server-set) Additional information in
      the form of text messages when the "error" disposition modifier
      appears.

   o  *extensionFields*: "String[String]|null" (server-set) Object where
      keys are extension-field names and values are extension-field
      values.

   A *Disposition* object has the following properties:

   o  *actionMode*: "String" This MUST be one of the following strings:
      "manual-action" / "automatic-action"

   o  *sendingMode*: "String" This MUST be one of the following strings:
      "MDN-sent-manually" / "MDN-sent-automatically"

   o  *type*: "String" This MUST be one of the following strings:
      "deleted" / "dispatched" / "displayed" / "processed"

   See [RFC8098] for the exact meaning of these different fields.

2.1.  MDN/set

   Standard "/set" method as described in [RFC8620] where only the
   _create_ parameter is supported.

   The MDN/set method generates and sends an [RFC5322] message from an
   MDN object.

   The client SHOULD NOT issue a MDN/set request if the message has the
   "$MDNSent" keyword set.  In this case, the server MUST reject the
   submission with a standard "alreadyExists" SetError.

Internet-Draft              JMAP MDN handling                  July 2019


   When sending the MDN, the server is in charge of generating the
   _originalRecipient_, _finalRecipient_ and _originalMessageID_ fields
   accordingly to the [RFC8098] specification.

   For each "forEmailId" whose MDN where sent, the server MUST add a
   "$MDNSent" keyword to the email.  See [RFC3503] for more details.

2.2.  MDN/parse

   This method allows a client to parse blobs as [RFC5322] messages to
   get MDN objects.  This can be used to parse and get detailed
   information about blobs referenced in the _mdnBlobIds_ of the
   EmailSubmission object, or any email the client could expect to be an
   MDN.

   The _forEmailId_ property can be null or missing if the
   _originalMessageID_ property is missing or not referencing an
   existing email.

   The Email/parse method takes the following arguments:

   o  *accountId*: "String" The id of the account to use.

   o  *blobIds*: "Id[]" The ids of the blobs to parse.

   The response has the following arguments:

   o  *accountId*: "Id" The id of the account used for the call.

   o  *parsed*: "Id[MDN]|null" A map of blob id to parsed MDN
      representation for each successfully parsed blob, or null if none.

   o  *notParsable*: "Id[]|null" A list of ids given that corresponded
      to blobs that could not be parsed as MDNs, or null if none.

   o  *notFound*: "Id[]|null" A list of blob ids given that could not be
      found, or null if none.

3.  Samples

3.1.  Sending an MDN for a received email

   A client can use the following request to send an MDN back to the
   sender:

       [[ "MDN/set", {
         "accountId": "ue150411c",
         "create": {
           "k1546": {
             "forEmailId": "Md45b47b4877521042cec0938",
             "subject": "Read receipt for: World domination",
             "textBody": "This receipt shows that the email has been
                 displayed on your recipient's computer. There is no
                 guaranty it has been read or understood.",
             "reportingUA": "linagora.com; OpenPaaS",
             "disposition": {
               "actionMode": "manual-action",
               "sendingMode": "MDN-sent-manually",
               "type": "displayed"
             }
           }
         }
       }, "0" ]]

   If the email id matches an existing email without the "$MDNSent"
   keyword, the server can answer:

     [[ "MDN/set", {
       "accountId": "ue150411c",
       "oldState": "012421s6-8nrq-4ps4-n0p4-9330r951ns21",
       "newState": "355421f6-8aed-4cf4-a0c4-7377e951af36",
       "created": {
         "k1546": {
           "finalRecipient": "rfc822; john@example.com",
           "originalMessageID": "<1521557867.2614.0.camel@apache.org>"
         }
       }
     }, "0" ],

3.2.  Asking for MDN when sending an email

   This is done with the [I-D.ietf-jmap-mail] "Email/set" _create_
   method.

            ...
          }
        }
      }, "0" ]]

   Note the specified "Disposition-Notification-To" header indicating
   where to send MDN back (usually the sender of the email).

3.3.  Parsing a received MDN

   The client issues a parse request:

          [[ "MDN/parse", {
            "accountId": "ue150411c",
            "blobIds: [ "0f9f65ab-dc7b-4146-850f-6e4881093965" ]
          }, "0" ]]

   The server responds:
