1. Introduction

   In this document, the requirements for a video codec designed mainly
   for use over the Internet are presented. The requirements encompass
   a wide range of applications that use data transmission over the
   Internet including IPTV (broadcasting over IP-based networks), peer-
   video conferencing, video sharing, screencasting, and video
   monitoring/ surveillance. For each application, typical resolutions,
   frame-rates and picture access modes are presented. Specific
   requirements related to data transmission over packet-loss networks
   are considered as well.

2. Applications

   In this chapter, an overview of video codec applications that are
   currently available on the Internet market is presented. It is worth
   noting that there are different use cases for each application that
   define a target platform, and hence there are different types of

   communication channels involved (e.g., wired or wireless channels)
   that are characterized by different quality of service as well as
   bandwidth. The target platform and the channel bandwidth determine
   resolutions, frame-rates and quality or bit-rates for video streams
   to be encoded or decoded.



2.1. Internet Protocol Television (IPTV)

   This is a type of pre-recorded broadcasting over IP-based networks.
   Typical content used in this application is movies, cartoons,
   series, TV shows, etc. The main requirements are as follows:

   o  Random access to pictures, i.e. random access period (RAP) should
      be kept small enough (approximately, 1-15 seconds);

   o  Temporal (frame-rate) scalability;

   o  Error robustness.

   For this application, typical values of resolutions, frame-rates,
   and RAPs are presented in Table 1.

2.2. Video conferencing

   This is a form of video connection over the Internet. This form
   allows users to establish connections to two or more people by two-
   way video and audio transmission for communication in real-time. For
   this application, both stationary and mobile devices can be used.
   The main requirements are as follows:

   o  Delay should be kept as low as possible (the preferable and
      maximum delay values should be less than 100 ms and 350 ms,
      respectively);

   o  Temporal (frame-rate) scalability;

   o  Error robustness.

   For this application, typical values of resolutions, frame-rates,
   and RAPs are presented in Table 2.

2.3. Video sharing

   This is a service that allows people to upload and share video data
   (using live streaming or not) and to watch them. It is also known as
   video hosting. A typical scenario for this application is to capture
   video using mobile cameras such as GoPro or cameras integrated into
   smartphones (amateur video). The main requirements are as follows:

   o  Random access to pictures for downloaded video data;

   o  Temporal (frame-rate) scalability;

   o  Resolution and quality (SNR) scalability;

   o  Error robustness.

   For this application, typical values of resolutions, frame-rates,
   and RAPs are presented in Table 3.

2.4. Screencasting

   This is a service that allows users to record and distribute
   computer screen output. This service requires efficient compression
   of computer-generated content with high visual quality (up to
   visually and mathematically lossless) [1]. Currently, this
   application includes animation (cartoons, gaming content, data
   visualization, i.e. such a type of content that is characterized by
   fast motion, rotation, smooth shade, 3D effect, highly saturated
   colors with full resolution, clear textures and sharp edges with
   distinct colors [1]), virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI),
   screen/desktop sharing and collaboration, supervisory control and
   data acquisition (SCADA) display, automotive/navigation display,

   cloud gaming, factory automation display, wireless display, display
   wall, digital operating room (DiOR), etc. For this application, an
   important requirement is the support of a wide range of video
   formats including RGB and YUV 4:4:4 in addition to YUV 4:2:0 and
   YUV 4:2:2 [1]. For this application, typical values of resolutions,
   frame-rates, and RAPs are presented in Table 4.

2.5. Game streaming

   This is a service that provides game content over the Internet to
   different local devices such as notebooks, gaming tablets, etc. In
   this category of applications, server renders 3D games in cloud
   server, and streams the game to any device with a wired or wireless
   broadband connection [2]. This allows anyone to play (or resume)
   full featured games from anywhere in the Internet [2]. An example of
   this application is Nvidia Grid [2]. Another category application is
   broadcast of video games played by people over the Internet in real
   time or for later viewing [2]. There are many companies such as
   Twitch, YY in China enable game broadcasting [2]. Games typically

   contain a lot of sharp edges and large motion [2]. The main
   requirements are as follows:

   o  Random access to pictures for downloaded video data;

   o  Temporal (frame-rate) scalability;

   o  Resolution and quality (SNR) scalability;

   o  Error robustness.

   For this application, typical values of resolutions, frame-rates,
   and RAPs are similar to ones presented in Table 4.

2.6. Video monitoring / surveillance

   This is a type of live broadcasting over IP-based networks. Video
   streams are sent to many receivers at the same time. A new receiver
   may connect to the stream at an arbitrary moment, so random access
   period should be kept small enough (approximately, ~1-5 seconds).
   Data are transmitted publicly in the case of video monitoring and
   privately in the case of video surveillance, respectively. For IP-
   cameras that have to capture, process and encode video data,
   complexity including computational and hardware complexity as well
   as memory bandwidth should be kept low to allow real-time
   processing. In addition, support of high dynamic range is an
   essential requirement for video surveillance. For this application,
   typical values of resolutions, frame-rates, and RAPs are presented
   in Table 5.

3. Requirements

   The most basic requirement is coding efficiency, i.e. compression
   performance. It should be better than for state-of-the-art video
   codecs such as HEVC/H.265 and VP9. Levels to be supported by the new
   codec are presented in Table 6.

   Table 6. Codec levels

3.1. Basic requirements

   o  Bit depth: 8- and 10-bits per color component;

   o  Color sampling formats: YUV 4:2:0, YUV 4:2:2;

   o  Support of "low-delay" configurations (delay should be up to 350
      ms but its preferable value should be less than 100 ms);

   o  Feasible real-time implementation of both an encoder and a
      decoder for hardware and software implementation based on a wide
      range of state-of-the-art platforms;

   o  Temporal (frame-rate) scalability;

   o  Error resilience tools that are complementary to the error
      protection mechanisms implemented on transport level.

3.2. Optional requirements

   o  Bit depth: up to 16-bits per color component;

   o  Color sampling formats: YUV 4:4:4 and RGB;

   o  Alpha channel support;

   o  Support of high dynamic range;

   o  Resolution and quality (SNR) scalability.

   o  Computational complexity scalability, i.e. computational
      complexity is decreasing along with degrading picture quality.

4. Evaluation methodology

4.1. Compression performance evaluation

   As shown in Fig.1, compression performance testing is performed in 3
   ranges :

   o  Low bit-rate range (LBR) is the range that contains the 4 lowest
      bit-rates of the 6 specified bit-rates;

   o  Medium bit-rate range (MBR) is the range that contains the 4
      medium bit-rates of the 6 specified bit-rates;

   o  High bit-rate range (HBR) is the range that contains the 4
      highest bit-rates of the 6 specified bit-rates.

   To avoid any rate control mechanisms that can significantly impact
   compression performance, the deviation between bit-rates of
   reference and tested codecs should be less than the threshold value
   that should be defined in a separate document. This deviation is
   calculated as follows:

                   D = abs((BRr - BRt)/ BRr)*100%,

   where BRr and BRt are bit-rates of reference and tested codecs.

                                           Bit-rate

   To assess the quality of output (decoded) sequences, two indexes,
   PSNR [3] and MS-SSIM [3,11], should be separately calculated for
   each color plane. For obtaining an integral estimation, BD-rate [4]
   should be computed for each range and each quality index. Finally,
   18 values should be obtained for a color format, which contains 3
   color planes (e.g., for YUV or RGB). A list of video sequences that
   should be used for testing as well as the 6 values of bit-rates are
   defined in a separate document. It should use the information on the
   codec applications presented in this document. As the reference for
   evaluation, the HEVC/H.265 codec [5,6] must be used. The reference
   source code of the HEVC/H.265 codec can be found at [7]. The
   HEVC/H.265 codec must be configured according to [8] and Table 9.

   +----------------------+-------------------------------------------+

   Table 9. Intra-periods for different HEVC/H.265 encoding modes
   according to [8]

   In addition to the objective quality measures defined above,
   subjective evaluation must also be performed before adopting any new
   tool and a final codec standard. For subjective tests, the MOS-based
   evaluation procedure must be used as described in section 2.1 of
   [3]. For perception-oriented tools that primarily impact subjective
   quality, additional tests may also be individually assigned even for
   intermediate evaluation, subject to a decision of the NETVC WG.



5. Security Considerations

   This document itself does not have any security considerations.
   However, it is worth noting that a codec implementation (for both an
   encoder and a decoder) should cover the worst case of computational
   complexity, memory bandwidth, and physical memory size (e.g., for
   decoded pictures used as references). Otherwise, it can be
   considered as a security vulnerability and lead to denial-of-service
   (DoS) in the case of attacks.

6. Conclusions

   In this document, an overview of Internet video codec applications
   and typical use cases as well as a prioritized list of requirements
   for an Internet video codec are presented. An evaluation methodology
   for this codec is also proposed.
