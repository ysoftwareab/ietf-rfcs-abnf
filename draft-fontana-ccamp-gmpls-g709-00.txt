Abstract

   This document is a companion to the Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
   signalling documents [GMPLS-SIG], [GMPLS-RSVP] and [GMPLS-LDP]. It
   describes the G.709 technology specific information needed to
   extend GMPLS signalling to control Optical Transport Networks
   (OTN) including the so-called pre-OTN developments both described
   in [G709-FRM].

1. Introduction

   Generalized MPLS extends MPLS from supporting Packet Switching
   Capable (PSC) interfaces and switching to include support of three
   new classes of interfaces and switching: Time-Division Multiplex
   (TDM), Lambda Switch (LSC) and Fiber-Switch (FSC). A functional
   description of the extensions to MPLS signaling needed to support
   the new classes of interfaces and switching is provided in [GMPLS-
   SIG]. [GMPLS-RSVP] describes RSVP-TE specific formats and
   mechanisms needed to support all four classes of interfaces, and
   CR-LDP extensions can be found in [GMPLS-LDP]. This document
   present the technology details that are specific to G.709 Optical
   Transport Networks (OTN) as specified in ITU-T G.709
   recommendation [ITUT-G709] which also includes pre-OTN
   developments. Per [GMPLS-SIG], G.709 specific parameters are
   carried through the signaling protocol in traffic parameter
   specific objects.

2. GMPLS Extensions for G.709

   Adapting GMPLS to control G.709 OTN, can be achieved by considering
   that G.709 defines two transport hierarchies: a digital (also known
   as the ôDigital Wrapperö) and an optical transport hierarchy. First,
   a digital layer (the previously defined ôDigital Wrapperö in [GMPLS-
   SIG]), which is defined as a Digital Path Layer, indeed a new TDM
   technology. Second, an Optical Channel layer or Optical Path layer
   including a digital OTM Overhead Signal (OOS), i.e. a non-associated
   overhead.

   GMPLS extensions for G.709 need to cover the Generalized Label
   Request, the Generalized Label as well as specific technology
   dependent fields such as those currently specified for SDH/SONET in
   [GMPLS-SSS]. Since the multiplexing in the electrical domain (such
   as ODUk multiplexing) will be added very soon into the version 2 of
   the G.709 recommendation, we can already propose a label space
   definition suitable for that purpose.

   As implicitly specified in GMPLS control for SDH/SONET Networks
   [GMPLS-SSS], since GFP is only used as a framing protocol we donÆt
   consider this framing layer to be included into the G.709 label
   space. Rather, we directly use the G.709 digital and optical
   transport hierarchies in order to define the corresponding label
   spaces.

3. Generalized Label Request

   The Generalized Label Request as defined in [GMPLS-SIG], includes a
   technology independent part and a technology dependent part (i.e.
   the traffic parameters). In this section, we suggest to adapt both
   parts in order to accommodate the GMPLS Signalling to the G.709
   recommendation [ITUT-G709].

3.1 Technology Independent Part

   As defined in [GMPLS-SIG], the LSP Encoding Type and the Generalized
   Protocol Identifier (Generalized-PID) constitute the technology
   independent part of the Generalized Label Request.

   The information carried in the technology independent part of the
   Generalized Label Request is defined as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | LSP Enc. Type |    Reserved   |             G-PID             |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   As mentioned here above, we suggest here to adapt the LSP Encoding
   Type and the G-PID (Generalized-PID) to accommodate G.709
   recommendation [ITUT-G709].

3.1.1 LSP Encoding Type

   Since G.709 defines two networking layers (ODUk layers and OCh
   layer), the LSP Encoding Type code-points can reflect these two
   layers currently defined in [GMPLS-SIG] as ôDigital Wrapperö and
   ôLambdaö code. The LSP Encoding Type is specified per networking
   layer or more precisely per group of functional networking layer:
   the ODUk layers and the OCh layer.

   Therefore, the current ôDigital Wrapperö code defined in [GMPLS-SIG]
   can be replaced by two separated code-points:
       - code for the G.709 Digital Path layer
       - code for the non-standard Digital Wrapper layer

   In the same way, two separated code-points can replace the current
   defined ôLambdaö code:
      - code for the G.709 Optical Channel layer
      - code for the non-standard Lambda layer (also referred to as
        Lambda layer which includes the pre-OTN Optical Channel layer)

   Moreover, the code for the G.709 Optical Channel (OCh) layer will
   indicate the capability of an end-system to use the G.709 non-
   associated overhead (naOH) i.e. the OTM Overhead Signal (OOS)
   multiplexed into the OTM-n.m interface signal.

3.1.2 Generalized-PID (G-PID)

   The G-PID (16 bits field) as defined in [GMPLS-SIG], identifies the
   payload carried by an LSP, i.e. an identifier of the client layer of
   that LSP. This identifier is used by the G.709 endpoints of the LSP.

   The G-PID can take one of the following values at the Digital Path
   layer, in addition to the payload identifiers already defined in
   [GMPLS-SIG]:
   - CBRa: asynchronous Constant Bit Rate i.e. mapping of STM-16/OC-48,
     STM-64/OC-192 and STM-256/OC-768
   - CBRb: bit synchronous Constant Bit Rate i.e. mapping of STM-16/OC-
     48, STM-64/OC-192 and STM-256/OC-768
   - ATM: Mapping at 2.5, 10 and 40 Gbps
   - BSOT: non-specific client Bit Stream with Octet Timing i.e.
     Mapping of 2.5, 10 and 40 Gbps Bit Stream
   - BSNT: non-specific client Bit Stream without Octet Timing i.e.
     Mapping of 2.5, 10 and 40 Gbps Bit Stream

   Therefore, the G-PID values defined in [GMPLS-SIG] are used when the
   client payloads are encapsulated through the GFP mapping procedure:
   Packets (translated by PoS), Ethernet and ATM Mapping. Noticed that
   other G-PID values not defined in [GMPLS-SIG] such as Escon and
   Fiber Channel could complete this list in the near future.

   In order to include pre-OTN developments, the G-PID at the Optical
   Channel Layer can in addition to the G.709 Digital Path Layer (at
   2.5 Gbps i.e. ODU1, 10 Gbps i.e. ODU2 and 40 Gbps i.e. ODU3) take
   one of the values currently defined in [GMPLS-SIG], in particular:
   - SDH: STM-16, STM-64 and STM-256
   - Sonet: OC-48, OC-192 and OC-768
   - Ethernet: 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps

   The following table summarizes the G-PID with respect to the LSP
   Encoding Type:

   G-PID Type           LSP Encoding Type

3.2 G.709 Traffic-Parameters

   When G.709 Digital Path Layer or G.709 Optical Channel Layer is
   specified in the LSP Encoding Type field, the information referred
   to as technology dependent information or simply traffic-parameters
   and carried additionally to the one included in the Generalized
   Label Request is defined as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  Signal Type  |  OOS  |  RMT  |             RNC               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |           Reserved            |          Multiplier           |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                       Transparency                            |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   In this frame, OOS stands for OTM Overhead Signal, RMT for Requested
   Multiplexing Type and RNC for Requested Number of Components. Each
   of these fields is tailored in order to support G.709 LSP.

3.2.1 Signal Type

   This field (8 bits) indicates the requested G.709 elementary Signal
   Type. The possible values are:

      Value    Type
      -----    ----
        0      irrelevant
        1      ODU1 (i.e. 2.5 Gbps)
        2      ODU2 (i.e. 10  Gbps)
        3      ODU3 (i.e. 40  Gbps)
        4      Reserved for future use
        5      OCh associated to an OTM-x.1
        6      OCh associated to an OTM-x.2
        7      OCh associated to an OTM-x.3
        8      Reserved for future use

   The value of the Signal Type field depends on the ôLambdaö code
   value (i.e. LSP Encoding Type value):
    - if the ôLambda codeö refers to the G.709 Digital Path layer
      then the valid values are the ODUk signals (k = 1, 2 or 3)
    - if the ôLambda codeö refers to the G.709 Optical Channel layer
      then the valid values are the OCh associated to the OTM-x.m
      interface signals (x = 0r, nr or n and m = 1, 2 or 3)
    - if the ôLambda codeö refers to the Pre-OTN Optical Channel layer
       then the valid values are the OCh associated to the pre-OTN
       interface (i.e. irrelevant)

3.2.2 Requested Multiplexing Type (RMT)

   The RMT field (4 bits) indicates the type of multiplexing being
   requested for ODUk LSP or OCh LSP. It is set to zero (by default).
   The possible values are defined in the following table:

        Value    Grouping type
        -----    -------------
          0      No multiplexing (default)
          1      Flexible multiplexing
          2      Inverse multiplexing
          3      Reserved for future use

   When used at the ODUk layer (i.e. digital path layer), flexible
   multiplexing as described in [G709-FRM], refers to the mapping of an
   ODU2 into four arbitrary OPU3 tributary slots (i.e. each slot
   containing one ODU1) arbitrarily selected to prevent that the
   bandwidth gets fragmented. Inverse multiplexing (or ODUk Virtual
   Concatenation) currently under definition at ITU-T is also
   considered but not used. The RMT field is set to zero (by default)
   to indicate an ODUk mapping i.e. neither ODUk flexible multiplexing
   nor ODUk inverse multiplexing is requested.

   When used at the Optical Channel layer, flexible multiplexing is
   reserved for future use while inverse multiplexing means that the
   requested composed signal constitutes a waveband (i.e. an optical
   channel multiplex). A waveband, denoted as OCh[j.k] (j >= 1) is
   defined as a non-contiguous set of identical optical channels j x
   OCh, each of them is associated to an OTM-x.m (x = nr or n) sub-
   interface signal. The bit rate of each OCh constituting the waveband
   (i.e. the composed L-LSP) must be identical, k is unique per OCh
   multiplex. By default, the RMT field is set to zero when used at the
   Optical Channel layer.

   Notice as well, that today both OTN and Pre-OTN specifications do
   not define the optical channel multiplex. Therefore, in this
   context, any waveband switching development as defined in this
   specification is purely vendor specific.

3.2.3 Requested Number of Components (RNC)

   The RNC field (16 bits) indicates the number of identical G.709
   signals (ODUk or OCh) to be multiplexed, as specified in the RMT
   field, for the requested LSP.

   This field must be ignored if no multiplexing is requested (RMT = 0)
   as per current [ITUT-G709] recommendation. An RMT value different
   from 0 must imply a number of components greater than 1.

   When applied at the Digital Path layer and requesting flexible
   multiplexing (RMT = 1, in particular for ODU2 connections) or
   inverse multiplexing (RMT = 2), the RNC field specifies the number
   of individual ODUk signals (in this case, RNC = 4 individual ODU1

D.Papadimitriou - Internet Draft û Expires December 2001             6

draft-fontana-ccamp-gmpls-g709-00.txt                        June 2001


   signals) constituting the requested connection. These components are
   still processed within the context of a single connection entity.

   When applied at the Optical Channel layer and requesting an Optical
   Channel multiplex (RMT = 2), the RNC field specifies the number of
   individual OCh signals constituting the requested connection. For
   instance, a waveband of 3 optical channels (also denoted to as
   OCh[3.k]) is requested by setting the RNC field to the value 3.

3.2.4 Reserved Fields

   The reserved field (16 bits) is dedicated for future Inverse
   Multiplexing (i.e. ODUk virtual multiplexing) purposes in the
   current specification. Reserved bits should be set to zero when sent
   and must be ignored when received.

3.2.5 OTM Overhead Signal (OOS)

   The OOS field (4 bits) indicates whether or not the non-associated
   overhead is supported at the G.709 Optical Channel layer. This
   feature is irrelevant (OOS = 0) at the G.709 Digital Path layer and
   the pre-OTN Optical Channel layer if the latter does not support non
   associated overhead. Other values are defined as follows:

      Value    Type
      -----    ----
        0      irrelevant
        1      OOS reduced functionality (limited overhead)
        2      OOS full functionality (full overhead)
        3      OOS vendor-specific (specific overhead)

   The usage of this field is defined as follows:

      - With OTM-0r.m and OTM-nr.m interfaces (reduced functionality
        stack), OTM Overhead Signal (OOS) is not supported. Therefore
        with these types of interface signals, the OOS Field = 1.

      - With OTM-n.m interfaces (full functionality stack), the OOS is
        supported and mapped into the Optical Supervisory Channel (OSC)
        which is multiplexed into the OTM-n.m using wavelength division
        multiplexing. With OTM-n.m interfaces, the OOS Field = 2.

      - With OTM-n.m interfaces (and eventually OTM-nr.m or even with
        OTM-0.m), non-standard OOS can be defined to allow for instance
        interoperability with pre-OTN based devices or with any optical
        devices which does not support G.709 OOS specification. This
        vendor-specific OOS value enables the use of any proprietary
        signal monitoring exchange through any kind of supervisory
        channel (it can be any kind of IP-based control channel). In
        this case, the OOS Field = 3.

draft-fontana-ccamp-gmpls-g709-00.txt                        June 2001


   The OOS field does not restrict the transport mechanism of the OTM
   Overhead Signal (OOS) since in-fiber/out-of-band OSC and out-of-
   fiber/out-of-band transport mechanisms are allowed.

3.2.6 Transparency

   Transparency is only defined for pre-OTN developments since by
   definition any signal transported over an OTN is fully transparent.
   Thus, this field can only be used when the LSP Encoding Type
   explicitly refers to the non-standard lambda layer.

   This 32-bits field is a vector of flags indicating the type of
   transparency selected when requesting a pre-OTN optical channel.
   Several flags can be combined to provide different types of
   transparency. Not all combinations are necessarily valid. As it is
   commonly the case today with Pre-OTN capable interfaces, three kinds
   of transparency levels are currently defined:
   - RS/Section and MS/Line overhead termination
   - RS/Section overhead termination with MS/Line overhead transparency
   - RS/Section overhead and MS/Line overhead transparency (also
     referred to as full transparency)

  The transparency field is used to request a pre-OTN LSP that
  supports the requested transparency, it may also be used to setup
  the transparency process to be applied in each intermediate LSR.

   The different transparency flags are the following (other
   transparency types are left for further study):
        - flag  1 (bit 1) : Section/Regenerator Section layer.
        - flag  2 (bit 2) : Line/Multiplex Section layer.

   Where bit 1 is the low order bit. Others flags are reserved for
   further use, they should be set to zero when sent, and must be
   ignored when received. A flag is set to one to indicate that the
   corresponding transparency is requested. For instance, RS/Section OH
   termination with MS/Line OH transparency is requested by setting the
   flag 1 = 0 and the flag 2 = 1 while full transparency is requested
   by setting the flag 1 = 1 and the flag 2 = 1.

   With pre-OTN interfaces terminating RS/Section and MS/Line overhead,
   the pre-OTN network must be capable to transport transparently
   HOVC/STS-SPE signals. This transparency type is defined as the
   default transparency and is specified value by zeroing all flags
   (default TOH transparency).

3.2.7 Multiplier

   The multiplier field (16 bits) indicates the number of identical
   composed signals requested for the LSP. A composed signal is the
   resulting signal from the application of the RMT, RNC, OOS and
   Transparency fields to an elementary Signal Type. GMPLS signalling
   implies today that all the composed signals must be part of the same
   LSP.

draft-fontana-ccamp-gmpls-g709-00.txt                        June 2001


   The multiplier field is set to one (default value) to indicate that
   exactly one base signal is being requested. Zero is an invalid
   value. When the multiplier field is greater than one, the resulting
   signal is referred to as a multiplied signal.

4. Generalized Label

   This section describes the Generalized Label space for the Digital
   Path and the Optical Channel Layer.

4.1 Digital Path Layer

   At the Digital Path layer (i.e. ODUk layers), G.709 defines three
   different client payload bit rates.  An Optical Data Unit (ODU)
   frame has been defined for each of these bit rates. ODUk refers to
   the frame at bit rate k, where k = 1 (for 2.5 Gbps), 2 (for 10 Gbps)
   or 3 (for 40 Gbps).

   In addition to the support of ODUk mapping into OTUk, the G.709
   label space must support the sub-levels of ODUk flexible
   multiplexing (or simply ODUk multiplexing):
   - ODU2 multiplexing:
        . The mapping of an ODU2 into four arbitrary OPU3 tributary
          slots selected arbitrarily (i.e. each slot containing one
          ODU1)
   - ODU3 multiplexing:
        . Not applicable today since higher order OPU tributary slots
          are not defined in the current [ITUT-G709] recommendation

   The G.709 Digital Path Layer label or ODUk label has the following
   format:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |             Reserved            | k3  |   k2    |     k1      |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The specification of the three fields k1, k2 and k3 self-
   consistently characterizes the ODUk label space. The value space of
   the k1, k2 and k3 fields is defined as follows:
   - k1: indicates a particular ODU1 in one ODU2 (k1 = 1,..,4), ODU3
         (k1 = 5,..,20); k1 values from 21 to 84 are reserved for
         future use
   - k2: indicates a particular ODU2 in one ODU3 (k2 = 1,..,4); k2
         values from 5 to 20 are reserved for future use
   - k3: k3 values (k3 = 1,..,4) are reserved for future use

   If k1, k2 and k3 values are equal to zero, the corresponding ODUk
   are not structured, i.e. k[i]=0 (i = 1, 2, 3) indicates that the
   ODU[i] is not structured and the ODU[i] is simply mapped into the
   OTU[i] as described in Section 4.4 of [G709-FRM].

draft-fontana-ccamp-gmpls-g709-00.txt                        June 2001


   Since k3 usage is not yet fully specified, k3 value always equals
   zero, k2 valid interval is [0,4] and k1 valid interval is [0,20].
   Thus, when used in a G.709 Generalized Label:
   - k1: indicates a particular ODU1 in one ODU2 (k1 = 1,..,4) or in
         one ODU3 (k1 = 5,..,20)
   - k2: indicates a particular ODU2 in one ODU3 (k2 = 1,..,4)

   If k1 and k2 values are equal to zero means non-significant: a
   particular ODUk is not structured, i.e. ki=0 indicates that the ODUi
   in not structured.

   Examples:
   - k2=0, k1=0 indicates a full ODU3 (full 40 Gbps).
   - k2=0, k1=3 indicates the third unstructured ODU1 in the ODU2.
   - k2=2, k1=0 indicates the second unstructured ODU2 in the ODU3.
   - k2=0, k1=8 indicates the fourth unstructured ODU1 in the ODU3.
   - k2=4, k1=2 indicates the second ODU1 of the fourth ODU2 in the
     ODU3.

4.2 Optical Channel layer

   At the Optical Channel layer, the label space should be consistently
   defined as a flat space whose values reflect the local assignment of
   OCh identifiers corresponding to the OTM-x.m sub-interface signals
   (m = 1, 2 or 3 and x = 0r, nr or n).

   The OCh identifiers could be defined as specified in [GMPLS-SIG]
   either with absolute values: channel identifiers (Channel ID) also
   referred to as wavelength identifiers or relative values: channel
   spacing also referred to as inter-wavelength spacing. The latter is
   strictly confined to a per-port label space while the former could
   be defined as a local or a global label space. Such an OCh label
   space is applicable to both OTN Optical Channel layer and pre-OTN
   Optical Channel layer.

5. Applications

   1. When one ODU1 (ODU2 or ODU3) non-structured signal is transported
   into one OTU1 (OTU2 or OTU3) payload, the upstream node requests in
   a non-structured ODU1 (ODU2 or ODU3) signal. In such conditions, the
   downstream node has to return a unique label since the ODU1 (ODU2 or
   ODU3) is directly mapped into the corresponding OTU1 (OTU2 or OTU3).
   When a single ODUk signal is requested (Signal Type = 1, 2 or 3 and
   RMT = 0), the downstream node has to return a single ODUk label. It
   could be one of the following when the Signal Type = 1:
   - k2=0, k1=0 indicating a single unstructured ODU1
   - k2=0, k1=3 indicating the third unstructured ODU1 in the ODU2
   - k2=0, k1=6 indicating the second unstructured ODU1 in the ODU3
   - k2=2, k1=3 indicating the third unstructured ODU1 of the second
     ODU2 in the ODU3

   2. When one ODU2 signal is transported into an ODU3 payload, which
   is sub-divided into 16 ODU1 tributary slots, the ODU tributary slots

   (here, denoted A, B, C and D with A < B < C < D) can be arbitrary
   selected. For instance, one ODU2 can be transported in ODU1
   tributary slots 5, 12, 13 and 18. Therefore, when the upstream node
   requests in such conditions a multiplexed ODU2 signal (Signal Type =
   2, RMT = 1 and RNC = 4), the downstream node returns four ODUk
   labels:
   - First label:  k1=5,  k2=0 (first ODU1)
   - Second label: k1=12, k2=0 (second ODU1)
   - Third label:  k1=13, k2=0 (third ODU1)
   - Fourth label: k1=18, k2=0 (fourth ODU1)

   3. When a single OCh signal of 40Gbps is requested (Signal Type = 7
   and RMT = 0), the downstream node must return a single wavelength
   label.

   4. When a composed OCh[4.2] signal is requested i.e. a waveband or
   optical channel multiplex composed by four bit-rate identical OCh
   signal of 10Gbps (Signal Type = 6, RMT = 2 and RNC = 4), the
   downstream node has to return four distinct wavelength labels to the
   requesting upstream node since the optical channels composing the
   multiplex are not necessarily contiguously multiplexed.

   5. When requesting multiple LSP (i.e. multiplier MT > 1), more than
   one label is returned to the requestor node. For instance, when the
   downstream node receives a request for a 4 x ODU1 signal (Signal
   Type = 1, RMT = 0 and MT = 4), it returns four labels to the
   upstream node: the first ODU1 label corresponding to the first
   signal of the LSP, the second ODU1 label corresponding to the second
   signal of the same LSP, etc. For instance, since ODU1 are non-
   contiguously multiplexed into one ODU3 such that corresponding
   labels are attributed independently:
   - First label:  k1=5,  k2=0 (first ODU1)
   - Second label: k1=8,  k2=0 (second ODU1)
   - Third label:  k1=18, k2=0 (third ODU1)
   - Fourth label: k1=19, k2=0 (fourth ODU1)

6. Signalling Protocol Extensions

   This section specifies the [GMPLS-RSVP] and [GMPLS-LDP] protocol
   extensions needed to accommodate G.709 traffic parameters.

6.1 RSVP-TE Details

   For RSVP-TE, the G.709 traffic parameters are carried in the G.709
   SENDER_TSPEC and FLOWSPEC objects.  The same format is used both
   for SENDER_TSPEC object and FLOWSPEC objects. The content of the
   objects is defined above in Section 3.2. The objects have the
   following class and type for G.709:
   - G.709 SENDER_TSPEC Object: Class = 12, C-Type = 4 (TBA)
   - G.709 FLOWSPEC Object: Class = 9, C-Type = 4 (TBA)

   There is no Adspec associated with the SONET/SDH SENDER_TSPEC.
   Either the Adspec is omitted or an Int-Serv Adspec with the

   Default General Characterization Parameters and Guaranteed Service
   fragment is used, see [RFC-2210].

   For a particular sender in a session the contents of the FLOWSPEC
   object received in a Resv message SHOULD be identical to the
   contents of the SENDER_TSPEC object received by receiver in the
   corresponding Path message. If the objects do not match, a ResvErr
   message with a "Traffic Control Error/Bad Flowspec value" error
   SHOULD be generated.

6.2 CR-LDP Details

   For CR-LDP, the G.709 traffic parameters are carried in the G.709
   Traffic Parameters TLV.  The content of the TLV is defined in
   Section 3.2. The header of the TLV has the following format:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The type field indicates G.709 OTN: 0xTBA

Appendix 2 û G.709 Indexes

   - Index k: The index "k" is used to represent a supported bit rate
   and the different versions of OPUk, ODUk and OTUk. k=1 represents an
   approximate bit rate of 2.5 Gbit/s, k=2 represents an approximate
   bit rate of 10 Gbit/s, k = 3 an approximate bit rate of 40 Gbit/s
   and k = 4 an approximate bit rate of 160 Gbit/s (under definition).
   The exact bit-rate values are in kbits/s:
    . OPU: k=1: 2 488 320.000, k=2: 9 995 276.962,  k=3: 40 150 519.322
    . ODU: k=1: 2 498 775.126, k=2: 10 037 273.924, k=3: 40 319 218.983
    . OTU: k=1: 2 666 057.143, k=2: 10 709 225.316, k=3: 43 018 413.559

draft-fontana-ccamp-gmpls-g709-00.txt                        June 2001



   - Index m: The index "m" is used to represent the bit rate or set of
   bit rates supported on the interface. This is a one or more digit
   ôkö, where each ôkö represents a particular bit rate. The valid
   values for m are (1, 2, 3, 12, 23, 123).

   - Index n: The index "n" is used to represent the order of the OTM,
   OTS, OMS, OPS, OCG and OMU. This index represents the maximum number
   of wavelengths that can be supported at the lowest bit rate
   supported on the wavelength. It is possible that a reduced number of
   higher bit rate wavelengths are supported. The case n=0 represents a
   single channel without a specific wavelength assigned to the
   channel.

   - Index r: The index "r", if present, is used to indicate a reduced
   functionality OTM, OCG, OCC and OCh (non-associated overhead is not
   supported). Note that for n=0 the index r is not required as it
   implies always reduced functionality.
