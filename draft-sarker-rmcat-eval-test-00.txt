               Test Cases for Evaluating RMCAT Proposals
                    draft-sarker-rmcat-eval-test-00

Abstract

   The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used to transmit media in
   multimedia telephony applications, these applications are typically
   required to implement congestion control.  The RMCAT working group is
   currently working on candidate algorithms for such interactive real-
   time multimedia applications.  This document describes the test cases
   to be used in the evaluation of the performance of those candidate
   algorithms.

1.  Introduction

   This memo describes a set of test cases for evaluating candidate
   RMCAT congestion control algorithm proposals, it is based on the
   guidelines enumerated in [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-criteria] and
   requirements discussed in [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].  The test
   cases cover basic usage scenarios and are described using a common
   structure, which allows for additional test cases to be added to
   those described herein to accommodate other topologies and/or the
   modeling of different link characteristics.  Each test case
   incorporates the metrics, evaluation guidelines and parameters
   described in [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-criteria].  It is the intention of
   this work to capture the consensus of the RMCAT working group
   participants regarding the test cases upon which the performance of
   the candidate RMCAT proposals should be evaluated.

2.  Terminology

   The terminology defined in RTP [RFC3550], RTP Profile for Audio and
   Video Conferences with Minimal Control [RFC3551], RTCP Extended
   Report (XR) [RFC3611], Extended RTP Profile for RTCP-based Feedback
   (RTP/AVPF) [RFC4585], Support for Reduced-Size RTCP [RFC5506], and
   RTP Circuit Breaker algorithm [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-circuit-breakers]
   apply.

3.  Basic Structure of Test cases

   All test cases in this document follow a basic structure allowing
   implementers to describe a new test scenarios without repeatedly
   explaining common attributes.  The structure includes a general
   description section that describes the test case and motivations,
   additionally it defines a set of attributes that characterize the
   testbed, i.e., the network path between communicating peers and the
   diverse traffic sources.

   o  Define the test case:

      *  General description: describes the motivation and the goals of
         the test case.

      *  Additionally, describe the desired rate adaptation behaviour.

      *  Define a checklist to evaluate the desired behaviour: this
         indicates the minimum set of metrics (e.g., link utiilization,
         media sending rate) that a proposed algorithm needs to measure
         to validate the expected rate adaptation behaviour.  It should
         also indicate the time granularity (e.g., averaged over 10ms,
         100ms, or 1s) for measuring certain metrics.  Typical
         measurement interval is 200ms.

   o  Define testbed topology: every test case needs to define an
      evaluation testbed topology.  Figure 1 shows such an evaluation
      topology.  In this evaluation topology, S1..Sn are traffic
      sources, these sources either generate media traffic and use an
      RMCAT candidate congestion control algorithm or use a different
      congestion control algorithm than that one used in the media
      source.  R1..Rn are the corresponding receivers.  A test case can
      have one or more such traffic source (S) and corresponding
      receiver (R).  The path from the source to destination is denoted
      as upstream and the path from a destination to a source is denoted
      as downstream.  It is possible for a testbed to have different
      path characteristics in either directions.  The following basic
      structure of test case has been described from the perspective of
      endpoints attached on the left-hand side of Figure 1.

                  Figure 1: Example of A Testbed Topology

   o  In a laboratory testbed environment there exists large amount of
      traffic on the network path between the endpoints, which may be
      contributed by other devices connected to such a testbed.  It is
      recommended to not route non-test traffic through the testbed.

   o  Define testbed attributes:

      *  Duration: defines the duration of the test.

      *  Path characteristics: defines the end-to-end transport level
         path characteristics of the testbed in a particular test case.
         Two sets of attributes describes the path characteristics, one
         for the upstream path and the other for the downstream path.
         The path characteristics for a particular path direction is
         applicable to all the Sources "S" sending traffic on that path.
         If only one attribute is specified, it is used for both path
         directions.

         +  Path direction: upstream or downstream.

         +  Bottleneck-link capacity: defines minimum capacity of the
            end-to-end path

         +  One-way propagation delay: describes the end-to-end latency
            along the path when network queues are empty i.e., the time
            it takes for a packet to go from the sender to the receiver,
            it does not include any queuing delay.

         +  Maximum end-to-end jitter: defines maximum jitter can be
            observed along the path.

         +  Bottleneck queue type: for example, Droptail, FQ-CoDel, or
            PIE.

         +  Bottleneck queue size: defines size of queue in terms of
            queuing time when the queue is full (in milliseconds).

         +  Path loss ratio: characterize the non-congested losses
            observed on the end-to-end path.  MUST describe the loss
            pattern or loss model.

      *  Application-related: defines the media-related behaviour for
         implementing the test case

         +  Media Source: defines the characteristics of the media
            sources present.  When using more than one media source, the
            different attributes are enumerated separately for each
            different media source.

            -  Media type: Video/Voice/Application/Text

            -  Media flow direction: upstream, downstream or both.

            -  Number of media sources: defines the total number of
               media sources

            -  Media codec: Constant Bit Rate (CBR) or Variable Bit Rate
               (VBR)

            -  Media source behaviour: describes the media encoder
               behavior.  It MUST define the main parameters than affect
               the adaptation behaviour.  This may include but not
               limited to:

               o  Adaptability: describes the adaptation options.  For
                  example, in case of video it defines the range of
                  bitrate adaptation, frame rate adaption, video
                  resolution adaptation.  In case of voice, it defines
                  the range of bitrate adaptation, sampling rate, frame
                  size.

               o  Output variation : for VBR encoder, it defines the
                  encoder output variation from the average target rate.
                  For example on average the encoder output may vary
                  between 5% to 15% above or below the average target
                  bit rate.

               o  Encoder's responsiveness to a new bit rate request:
                  value typically between 10ms to 1000ms.

            -  Media content: describes the chosen media sequences; For
               example, test sequences are available at: [xiph-seq]
               [HEVC-seq].

            -  Media timeline: describes the point when the media source
               is introduced and removed from the testbed.  For example,
               the media source may begin transmitting when the test
               case begins or a few seconds after, etc.

            -  Startup behaviour: the media starts at a defined bit
               rate, which may be the minimum, maximum bit rate, or a
               value in between (in Kbps).

         +  Competing traffic source: describes the characteristics of
            the competing traffic source, the different types of
            competing flows are enumerated in
            [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-criteria].

            -  Traffic direction: Upstream, downstream or both.

            -  Type of sources: defines the types of competing traffic
               sources.  Types of competing traffic flows are listed in
               [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-criteria].  For example, the number
               of TCP flows connected to a web browser, the mean size
               and distribution of the content downloaded.

            -  Number of sources: defines the total number of competing
               sources of each type.

            -  Congestion control: enumerate the congestion control used
               by each type of competing traffic.

            -  Traffic timeline: describes when the competing traffic is
               added and removed from the test case.

      *  Additional attributes: describes attributes essential for
         implementing a test case which are not included in the above
         structure.  These attributes MUST be well defined, so that
         other implementers are able to implement it.

   Any attribute can have a set of values (enclosed within "[]").  Each
   member value of such a set MUST be treated as different value for the
   same attribute.  It is desired to run separate tests for each such
   attribute value.

   The test cases described in this document follow the above structure.

4.  Basic Test Cases

4.1.  Variable Available Capacity

   In this test case the bottleneck-link capacity between the two
   endpoints varies over time.  This test is designed to measure the
   responsiveness of the candidate algorithm.  This test tries to
   address the requirement 1(a) in [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements],
   which requires the algorithm to adapt the flow(s) and provide lower
   end-to-end latency when there exists:

   o  an intermediate bottleneck

   o  change in available capacity due to interface change and/or
      routing change.

   o  persistent network load due to competing traffic

   It should be noted that the exact variation in available capacity due
   to any of the above depends on the under-lying technologies.  Hence,
   we describe a set of known factors, which may be extended to devise a
   more specific test case targeting certain behaviour in a certain
   network environment.

   Expected behavior: the candidate algorithms is expected to detect the
   variation in available capacity and adapt the media stream(s)
   accordingly.  The flows stabilize around their maximum bitrate as the
   as the maximum link capacity is large enough to accommodate the
   flows.  When the available capacity drops, the flow(s) adapts by
   decreasing its sending bit rate, and when congestion disappears, the
   flow(s) are again expected to ramp up.

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the following metrics
   at a fine enough time granularity:

   1.  Flow level:

       a.  End-to-end delay

       b.  Losses observed at the receiving endpoint

       c.  Feedback message overhead

   2.  Transport level:

       a.  Bandwidth utilization

4.2.  Maximum Media Bit Rate is Greater than Link Capacity

   In this case, the application will attempt to ramp up to its maximum
   bit rate, since the link capacity is limited to a value lower, the
   congestion control scheme is expected to stabilize the sending bit
   rate close to the available bottleneck capacity.  This situation can
   occur when the endpoints are connected via thin long networks even
   though the advertised capacity of the access network may be higher.
   The test case addresses the requirement 1 and 10 of the
   [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].

   Expected behavior: the candidate algorithm is expected to detect the
   path capacity constraint, converges to bottleneck link's capacity and
   adapt the flow to avoid unwanted oscillation when the sending bit
   rate is approaching the bottleneck link's capacity.  The oscillations
   occur when the media flow(s) attempts to reach its maximum bit rate,
   overshoots the usage of the available bottleneck capacity, to rectify
   it reduces the bit rate and starts to ramp up again.

   Testbed topology: One media source S1 is connected to corresponding
   R1.  The media traffic is transported over the upstream path and
   corresponding feedback/control traffic is transported over the
   downstream path.

4.3.  Competing Flows with same RMCAT Algorithm

   In this test case, more than one RMCAT media flow shares the
   bottleneck link and each of them uses the same congestion control
   algorithm.  This is a typical scenario wherein a real-time
   interactive application sends more than one media flows to the same
   destination and these flows are multiplexed over the same port.  In
   such a scenario it is likely that the flows will be routed via the
   same path and need to share the available bandwidth amongst
   themselves.  For the sake of simplicity it is assumed that there are
   no other competing traffic sources in the bottleneck link and that
   there is sufficient capacity to accommodate all the flows
   individually.  While this appears to be a variant of the test case
   defined in Section 4.1 , however it tests the capacity sharing
   distribution of the candidate algorithm.  Whereas, the previous test
   case measures the stability and responsiveness of the candidate
   algorithm.  This test case particularly addresses the requirements
   2,3 and 10 in [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].

   Expected behavior: It is expected that the competing flows will
   converge to an optimum bit rate to accommodate all the flows with
   minimum possible latency and loss.  Specifically, the test introduces
   three media flows at different time instances, when the second flow
   appears there should still be room to accommodate another flow on the
   bottleneck link.  Lastly, when the third flow appears the bottleneck
   link should be saturated.

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the following metrics
   metrics at a fine enough time granularity:

   1.  Flow level:

4.4.  RMCAT Flow competing with a long TCP Flow

   In this test case, one or more RMCAT media flow shares the bottleneck
   link with at least one long lived TCP flows.  Long lived TCP flows
   download data throughout the session and are expected to have
   infinite amount of data to send and receive.  This is a scenario
   wherein a multimedia application co-exists with a large file
   download.  The test case measures the adaptivity of the candidate
   algorithm to competing traffic, it addresses the requirement 8 in
   [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].

   Expected behavior: depending on the convergence observed in test case
   4.1 and 4.2, the candidate algorithm may be able to avoid congestion
   collapse.  In the worst case, the media stream will fall to the
   minimum media bit rate.

4.5.  RMCAT Flow competing with short TCP Flows

   In this test case, one or more RMCAT media flow shares the bottleneck
   link with at multiple short-lived TCP flows.  Short-lived TCP flows
   resemble the on/off pattern observed in the web traffic, wherein
   clients (browsers) connect to a server and download a resource
   (typically a webpage, few images, text files, etc.)  using several
   TCP connections (up to 4).  This scenario shows the performance of
   the multimedia application when several browser windows are active.
   The test case measures the adaptivity of the candidate algorithm to
   competing web traffic, it addresses the requirements 2 in
   [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].

   Depending on the number of short TCP flows, the cross-traffic either
   appears as a short burst flow or resembles a long TCP flow.  The
   intention of this test is to observe the impact of short-term burst
   on the behaviour of the candidate algorithm.

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the following metrics
   at a fine enough time granularity:

   1.  Flow level:

       a.  End-to-end delay for the RMCAT flow.

       b.  RTP packet losses observed at the receiving endpoint.

       c.  Variation in sending bit rate and goodput.  Mainly observing
           the frequency and magnitude of oscillations.

       d.  Variation in the sending rate of the TCP flow.

       e.  TCP throughput.

       f.  Convergence time.

       g.  Feedback message overhead.

   2.  Transport level:

       a.  Bandwidth utilization.

       b.  Queue length (ms):

           +  average over the length of the session

           +  5 and 95 percentile

   Testbed topology: One (1) media source S1 is connected to
   corresponding R1, but both endpoints are additionally receiving and
   sending data, respectively.  The media traffic (S1->S2) is
   transported over the upstream path and corresponding feedback/control
   traffic is transported over the downstream path.  Likewise media
   traffic (S2->S1) is transported over the downstram path and
   corresponding feedback/control traffic is transported over the
   upstream path.  The TCP uploads traffic over upstream path and
   downloads over downstream path.  Hence, TCP traffic exits in both
   path directions.  The topology described here is similar to the one
   described in Figure 5.

4.6.  Congested Feedback Link

   RMCAT WG has been chartered to define algorithms for RTP hence it is
   assumed that RTCP, RTP header extension or such would be used as
   signalling means for the adaptation algorithm in the backchannel.
   Due to asymmetry nature of the link between communicating peers it is
   possible to observer lack such backchannel information due to
   impaired backchannel link (even when forward channel might be
   unimpaired).  This test case is designed to observer candidate
   congestion control behaviour in such an event.  This test case
   addresses requirement number 5 and in particular, requirement number
   7.

Internet-Draft          Test Scenarios for RMCAT           February 2014


   It is expected that the candidate algorithms should cope with the
   lack of backchannel information and adapt to minimize the performance
   degradation of media flows in the forward channel.

   It SHOULD be noted that for this test case log is needed for the
   reference case where the downstream channel has no impairments

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the following metrics
   at a fine enough time granularity:

   1.  Flow level:

       a.  End-to-end delay

       b.  Losses observed at the receiving endpoint

       c.  Feedback message overhead

   2.  Transport level:

       a.  Bandwidth utilization

       b.  Queue length (ms):

           +  average over the length of the session

           +  5 and 95 percentile

   .

   Testbed topology: One (1) media source S1 is connected to
   corresponding R1, but both endpoints are additionally receiving and
   sending data, respectively.  The media traffic (S1->S2) is
   transported over the upstream path and corresponding feedback/control
   traffic is transported over the downstream path.  Likewise media
   traffic (S2->S1) is transported over the downstram path and
   corresponding feedback/control traffic is transported over the
   upstream path.

4.7.  Round Trip Time Fairness

   In this test case, more than one RMCAT media flow shares the
   bottleneck link, but the end-to-end path latency for each RMCAT flow
   is different.  For the sake of simplicity it is assumed that there
   are no other competing traffic sources in the bottleneck link and
   that there is sufficient capacity to accommodate all the flows.
   While this appears to be a variant of the test case 4.2, it tests the
   capacity sharing distribution of the candidate algorithm under
   different RTTs.  This test case particularly addresses the
   requirements 2 [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].

   It is expected that the competing flows will converge to an optimum
   bit rate to accommodate all the flows with minimum possible latency
   and loss.  Specifically, the test introduces five media flows at the
   same time instance.

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the following metrics
   at a fine enough time granularity:

   1.  Flow level:

       a.  End-to-end delay.

       b.  RTP packet losses observed at the receiving endpoint.

       c.  Variation in sending bit rate and goodput.  Mainly observing
           the frequency and magnitude of oscillations.

       d.  Convergence time.

   2.  Transport level:

       a.  Bandwidth utilization.

       b.  Queue length (ms):

   Testbed Topology: Five (5) media sources S1,S2,..,S5 are connected to
   their corresponding media sinks R1,R2,..,R5.  The media traffic is
   transported over the upstream path and corresponding feedback/control
   traffic is transported over the downstream path.  The topology is the
   same as test case 4.3 defined in Section 4.3.  The end-to-end path
   delay for S1-R1 is 10ms, S2-R2 is 25ms, S3-R3 is 50ms, S4-R4 is
   100ms, S5-R5 is 150ms.

4.8.  Media Pause and Resume

   In this test case, more than one real-time interactive media flows
   share the link bandwidth and all flows reach to a steady state by
   utilizing the link capacity in an optimum way.  At these stage one of
   the media flow is paused for a moment.  This event will result in
   more available bandwidth for the rest of the flows and as they are on
   a shared link.  When the paused media flow will resume it would no
   longer have the same bandwidth share on the link.  It has to make it
   way through the other existing flows in the link to achieve a fair
   share of the link capacity.  This test case is important specially
   for real-time interactive media which consists of more than one media
   flows and can pause/resume media flow at any point of time during the
   session.  This test case directly addresses the requirement number
   1.B in [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].  One can think it as a
   variation of test case 4.3.  However, it is different as the
   candidate algorithms can use different strategies to increase it s
   efficiency, for example the fairness, convergence time, reduce
   oscillation etc, by capitalizing the fact that they have previous
   information of the link.

   To evaluate the performance of the candidate algorithms it is
   expected to log enough information to visualize the following metrics
   at a fine enough time granularity:
