Abstract

   The iSCSI protocol provides a way for hosts to access SCSI devices
   over an IP network.  This document defines the use of the Service
   Location Protocol (SLP) by iSCSI hosts, devices, and name services,
   along with the SLP service type templates that describe the services
   they provide.

2.  Introduction

   iSCSI [iSCSI] is a protocol used to transport SCSI [SAM2] commands,
   data, and status across an IP network.  This protocol is connection-
   oriented, and is currently defined over TCP.  iSCSI uses a client-
   server relationship.  The client end of the connection is an
   initiator, and sends SCSI commands; the server end of the connection
   is called a target, and receives and executes the commands.

   There are several methods an iSCSI initiator can use to find the
   targets to which it should connect.  The discovery of iSCSI targets
   can be configured on the initiator in several ways:

   - Each target and its address can be statically configured on the
     initiator.

   - Each address providing targets can be configured on the initiator;
     the initiator can query the address for a list of targets.

   - A storage name server address can be configured on the initiator;
     the initiator can use the protocol it provides to obtain a list of
     targets.

   These methods are further defined in "iSCSI Naming and Discovery
   Requirements" [NDT].

   Each of the above methods requires a small amount of configuration to
   be done on each initiator.  The ability to discover targets and name
   services without having to configure initiators is a desirable
   feature.  The Service Location Protocol (SLP) [SLP] is an IETF
   standards track protocol that provides several features that will
   simplify locating iSCSI services.  This document describes how SLP
   can be used in iSCSI environments to discover targets, addresses
   providing targets, and storage name servers.


3.  Notation Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


4.  Terminology

   Here are some definitions that may aid readers that are unfamiliar
   with either SLP, SCSI, or iSCSI.  Some of these definitions have been
   reproduced from [RFC2608] and "Finding an RSIP Server with SLP"
   [RSIP].

   User Agent (UA)       A process working on the client's behalf to
                         establish contact with some service.  The UA
                         retrieves service information from the Service
                         Agents or Directory Agents.

   Service Agent (SA)    A process working on behalf of one or more
                         services to advertise the services and their
                         capabilites.

   Directory Agent (DA)  A process which collects service
                         advertisements.  There can only be one DA

                         present per given host.

   Scope                 A named set of services, typically making up a
                         logical administrative group.

   Service Advertisement A URL, attributes, and a lifetime (indicating
                         how long the advertisement is valid), providing
                         service access information and capabilities
                         description for a particular service.

   Initiator             A logical entity, typically within a host, that
                         sends SCSI commands to targets to be executed.
                         An initiator is usually present in the form of
                         a device driver.

   Target                A logical entity, typically within a storage
                         controller or gateway, that received SCSI
                         commands from an initiator and executes them.
                         A target includes one or more Logical Units
                         (LUs); each LU is SCSI device, such as a disk
                         or tape drive.

   WWUI                  World-Wide Unique Identifier.  This is a UTF-8
                         character string which serves as a unique
                         identifier for iSCSI initiators and targets.
                         Its format and usage is further defined in
                         [NDT].

   iSCSI Client          A logical entity, typically a host, which
                         includes at least one iSCSI Initiator.

   iSCSI Server          A logical entity, typically a storage
                         controller or gateway, which includes at least
                         one iSCSI Target.

   Storage Name Server   An addressible entity that provides one of
                         several discovery and management services that
                         benefit an iSCSI environment.  Storage Name
                         Server is used as a generic term, and is not
                         necessarily equivalent to that used within
                         Fibre Channel.


5.  Using SLP for iSCSI Service Discovery

   At least two entities are involved in iSCSI discovery.  The end
   result is that an iSCSI initiator (e.g. a host) discovers iSCSI
   targets, usually provided by storage controllers or gateways.  An



Bakke                                                           ^L[Page 4]





Internet Draft                iSCSI and SLP                February 2001


   iSCSI initiator may either discover these targets directly, using
   SLP, or may opt to discover them through a storage name service.  One
   name service protocol currently under development is iSNS [ISNS].  In
   the first case, only SLP is needed.  In the second, SLP may be used
   to discover a name server, which can be used to provide additional
   capabilities beyond simple target discovery.

   This section first describes the use of SLP for discovery of targets
   by iSCSI initiators, and then describes the use of SLP to discover
   storage name servers.

   This document assumes that SLPv2 will be used when discovering iSCSI-
   related services; no attempt is made to include support for SLPv1.

5.1.  Discovering iSCSI Targets using SLP

   The following diagram shows the relationship between iSCSI clients,
   servers, initiators, and targets.  An iSCSI client includes at least
   one iSCSI initiator, and an SLP user agent (UA).  An iSCSI server
   includes at least one iSCSI target, and an SLP service agent (SA).
   Some entities, such as extended copy engines, include both initiators
   and targets.  These include both an SA, for its targets to be
   discovered, and a UA, for its intiator(s) to discover other targets.

   In the above drawing, the iSCSI server has three iSCSI targets that
   the client could discover.  The first two, targets "one" and "two",
   are actual targets that can support SCSI commands.  The third,
   "iscsi", is the canonical target.  An initiator can log in to this
   target, and use an iSCSI command called "SendTargets" to obtain a
   list of the other targets within this iSCSI server.

   Each of the iSCSI targets has a unique name, called a World-Wide
   Unique Identifier (WWUI).  This identifier is the same regardless of
   the network path over which the target is discovered and accessed.
   For this example, the WWUIs "one" and "two" are used.  A real WWUI
   incorporates more structure, including a naming authority, and is not
   described here.

   Each of the iSCSI targets in the drawing can appear at two addresses,
   since two network ports are present.  Each target, then, would have
   two URLs.

   An iSCSI target URL consists of its fully qualified host name or IP
   address, the TCP port on which it is listening, and its world- wide
   unique identifier.  If the server in this drawing is listening at TCP
   port 3000 for both network addresses, the service URLs present would
   be:

   - 10.1.30.21:3000/one

   - 10.1.30.21:3000/two

   - 10.1.30.21:3000/iscsi

   - 10.1.40.3:3000/one

   - 10.1.40.3:3000/two

   - 10.1.40.3:3000/iscsi

   An iSCSI server has two options when registering targets with the
   service location protocol:

   - Register the canonical target "iscsi" at each of its network
     addresses.  The initiator can use this target to discover the
     others.  This would create two service URLs in the example.

   - The server can register the individual targets, "one" and "two", at
     each of its network addresses.  This would create four service URLs
     in the example.

   Although a target could do both types of registration, it would

Internet Draft                iSCSI and SLP                February 2001


   probably not be helpful.

   The iSCSI server constructs a service advertisement of the type
   "service:iscsi:target" for each of the service URLs it wishes to
   register.  The advertisement contains a lifetime, along with other
   attributes defined later in the service template.

   The remainder of the discovery procedure is identical to that used by
   any client/server pair implementing SLP:

   1. If an SLP DA is found, the SA contacts the DA and registers
      the advertisement.  If no DA is found, the SA maintains the
      advertisement itself, answering multicast UA queries
      directly.

   2. When the iSCSI initiator requires contact information for an
      iSCSI target, the UA either contacts the DA using unicast or
      the SA using multicast.  The UA includes a query based on
      the attributes to indicate the characteristics of the
      target(s) it requires.

   3. Once the UA has the host name or address of the iSCSI server
      as well as the port number and WWUI, it can begin the normal
      iSCSI login to the target.

5.2.  Discovering Storage Name Services using SLP

   Storage Name Servers can be built to perform discovery of targets in
   a variety of ways.  They can also provide extended services beyond
   discovery, which could include storage allocation and management.
   None of these services are defined here; the intent of this document
   is to allow these services to be discovered by clients.

   The following drawing shows an iSCSI client, an iSCSI server, and a
   storage name server.  To simplify the drawing, the second IP network
   is not shown, but is assumed to exist.  The storage name server would
   use its own protocol (snsp) to provide capabilities to iSCSI clients
   and servers; these clients and servers could both use SLP to discover
   the storage name server.

Internet Draft                iSCSI and SLP                February 2001


   Note the difference between the storage name server model and the
   previously-defined target discovery model.  When target discovery was
   used, the iSCSI Server implemented an SA, to be discovered by the
   initiator's UA.  In the storage name server model, the iSCSI clients
   and servers both implement UAs, and the name server implements the
   SA.  To be discovered by an initiator in this model, a target first
   find the storage name server, and then register itself with the name
   server using the name server's protocol.

   A storage name server's URL contains the domain name or IP address
   and TCP port.  No other information is required.

   The iSCSI server constructs a service advertisement of the type
   "service:iscsi:target" for each of the addresses at which it appears.
   The advertisement contains the URL, a lifetime, along with other
   attributes defined later in the service template.

   The remainder of the discovery procedure is identical to that used to
   discover iSCSI targets, except that both initiators and targets would
   normally be "clients" of the storage name service.


5.3.  Supporting Discovery of Targets and Name Services

   An initiator should support, at a minimum, discovery of targets using
   SLP.  If an initiator also supports a storage name service, the
   initiator should use SLP to discover the storage name service, and
   perform target discovery through the name service.  An initiator may
   discover other targets directly even when using a name service.

   For example, the name service may be used to discover targets at a
   remote location, and SLP used to discover local targets that are not
   part of the service.

   Targets that support a particular storage name service can be
   configured to be discovered through that name service.  A target
   configured in this way should not answer direct SLP discovery
   requests from initiators; they should effectively disable their
   service:iscsi:target SA functionality while under the control of a
   name service.  This prevents targets from being duplicated between
   SLP and the name service.  A target should also not be configured to
   support more than one name service at any time.


5.4.  Interoperating Between Initiators, Targets, and Name Services

   Many initiators will support the basic discovery of targets using
   SLP, but will not always support a particular storage name service in



Bakke                                                          ^L[Page 10]





Internet Draft                iSCSI and SLP                February 2001


   use.  A storage name server may provide the capability to support
   these initiators by forming service advertisements for use through
   its SA on behalf of the targets it has discovered.  This would allow
   an initiator to discover targets in a storage name service
   environment, without having direct support for the storage name
   service protocol in use.

   Targets not supporting the storage name service protocol in use can
   be discovered separately from the name service.


6.  iSCSI SLP Templates

   Three templates are provided: an iSCSI target template, a name
   service template, and an abstract template to encapsulate the two.


6.1.  The iSCSI Abstract Service Type Template

   This template defines the abstract service "service:iscsi".  It is
   used as a top-level service to encapsulate all other iSCSI-related
   services.

   Name of submitter: Mark Bakke
   Language of service template: en

     See the security considerations of the concrete service types.

   template-description=
     This is an abstract service type.  The purpose of the iscsi
     service type is to encompass all of the services used to support
     the iSCSI protocol.

6.2.  The iSCSI Target Concrete Service Type Template

   This template defines the service "service:iscsi:target".  An entity
   containing iSCSI targets that wishes them discovered via SLP would
   register each of them, with each of their addresses, as this service
   type.

   Initiators and name services wishing to discover targets in this way
   will generally use one of the following query strings:

   1. Find a specific target, given its WWUI:

        Service: service:iscsi:target
        Scope:   initiator-or-name-server-scope-list
        Query:   (wwui=iscsi.com.acme.sn.456)

   2. Find all of the target WWUIs that may allow access to a given
      initiator:

        Service: service:iscsi:target
        Scope:   initiator-or-name-server-scope-list
        Query:   (access-wwui=iscsi.com.os.hostid.045A7B)

   3. In addition, a name service may wish to discovery all targets,
      and assume responsibility for them.  It may simple query SLP
      for all of the targets:

        Service: service:iscsi:target
        Scope:   name-server-scope-list
        Query:   none

   Initiators attempting to discover their boot device may use the
   following query.

   4. Find the target WWUIs from which the given initiator is allowed
      to boot:

        Service: service:iscsi:target
        Scope:   name-server-scope-list
        Query:   (boot-wwui=iscsi.com.os.hostid.045A7B)

   More details on booting from an iSCSI target are defined in [BOOT].

   template-description=
     This is concrete service type.  The iscsi:wwui service type is used
     to register individual target (and perhaps initiator) addresses to
     be discovered by others.  UAs will generally search for these by
     either their WWUI, inclusion of a particular WWUI in the AccessWWUI
     list, or by URL for service deletion or attribute updates.

   template-url-syntax=
     url-path   =  ipaddr [ : tcpport ] / wwui
     ipaddr     =  DNS host name or ip address
     tcpport    =  decimal tcp port number

     ; The wwui part of the URL is required and may be either the WWUI of
     ; the target being registered, or the canonical WWUI "iscsi".  If the
     ; WWUI "iscsi" is registered, the initiator discoverying this URL may
     ; use the iSCSI SendTargets command to discover additional
     ; targets.  A device representing multiple targets may then either
     ; register each of them with SLP, or just register a single "iscsi"
     ; target, which will be used to discover the remainder of the
     ; targets.

   alias = string O
   # The alias string contains a descriptive name of the target.

   # A list of WWUI strings of initiators that can access this target.
   # Normal WWUI will be 50 characters or less; max WWUI is 255.
   # Normally, only one or a few values will be in the list.
   # Using the equivalence search on this will evaluate to "true"
   # if any one of the items in this list matches the query.
   # If this list contains the canonical WWUI "iscsi", any initiator
   # is allowed to access this target.

   boot-wwui = string M O
   # A list of WWUI strings of initiators that can boot from this target.
   # This list works precisely like the access-wwui list.  A WWUI appearing
   # in this list must either appear in the access-wwui list, or the
   # access-wwui list must contain the WWUI "iscsi".  Otherwise, an
   # initiator will be unable to find its boot target.
   # If boot-wwui contains the WWUI "iscsi", any host can boot from it,
   # but I am not sure if this is useful to anyone.
   # If this attribute is not registered, this target is not "bootable".
   #
   # Note that the LUN the host boots from is not specified here; a
   # host will generally attempt to boot from LUN 0.
   #
   # It is quite possible that other attributes will need to be defined
   # here for booting as well.

7.  Security Considerations

   Service type templates provide information that is used to interpret
   information obtained by clients through SLP. If the iSCSI templates
   are modified or if false templates are distributed, iSCSI targets and
   name servers may not correctly register themselves, or iSCSI clients
   may not be able to interpret service information.




Bakke                                                          ^L[Page 15]





Internet Draft                iSCSI and SLP                February 2001


   SLP provides an authentication mechanism for UAs to assure that
   service advertisments only come from trusted SAs. [RFC2608]  If trust
   is an issue, particularly with respect to the information sought by
   the client about IPSEC and IKE support, then SLP authentication
   should be enabled in the network.

   Once a target or name server is discovered, authentication and
   authorization are handled by the iSCSI protocol, or by the name
   server's protocol.  It is the responsibility of the providers of
   these services to ensure that an inappropriately advertised or
   discovered service does not compromise their security.


8.  Summary

   This document describes how SLP can be used by iSCSI initiators to
   find iSCSI targets and name servers.  Service type templates for
   iSCSI targets and name servers are presented.
