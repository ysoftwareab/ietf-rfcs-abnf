1. Abstract

   In  the  Global  Mobile  System  (GSM)  and   Universal   Mobile
   Telecommunication  System  (UMTS)  networks,  the  MAP  protocol
   plays a  central  role in  the  signaling communications between
   the Network Elements (NEs). The Internet Security Association and
   Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) defines a framework for security
   association management and cryptographic key establishment for the
   Internet.  This  document  defines  the  MAP  Security  Domain  of
   Interpretation (MAPSEC DOI), which  instantiates  ISAKMP  for  use
   with MAP. This new DOI is essentially an  exact copy  of  how  IKE
   works, except that it negotiates other protocols than AH and ESP
   in Phase 2 and runs on another port number.

2. Terms and Definitions

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].

3. Introduction

3.1. MAP and MAPSEC

   In  the  Global   Mobile   System  (GSM)  and  Universal  Mobile
   Telecommunication  System  (UMTS)  networks,  the  MAP  protocol
   plays a central  role in the  signaling  communications  between
   the Network Elements (NEs). User profiles exchange, authentication,
   and mobility management are performed  using MAP.  MAP  is an  SS7
   protocol  and runs over the  TCAP,  SCCP,  and MTP protocol layers,
   typically using dedicated PCM links. For a full description of the
   MAP protocol, see [MAP].

   The mobile  networks  are  moving  towards  IP-based solutions, and
   completely IP based networks and  new protocols such as SIP will in
   few years time replace MAP. However, MAP and SS7 signaling networks
   have to be supported during the transition time, and beyond, due to
   the need to retain legacy equipment in networks.

   Due to the role of MAP in the authentication process of GSM phones,
   operators are concerned about its lack of cryptographic security
   support. For this reason a new protocol header has been developed
   to protect MAP messages, much in the same way as IPsec ESP protects
   IP  packets.  This  new protocol is  called MAPSEC [NDSEC].  A key
   management mechanism is also needed for MAPSEC.

3.2. Domains of Interpretation

   Within ISAKMP, a Domain of Interpretation is used to group related
   protocols using ISAKMP to negotiate security associations.  Security
   protocols sharing a DOI choose security protocol and cryptographic
   transforms from a common namespace and share key exchange protocol
   identifiers.  They also share a common interpretation of DOI-specific
   payload data content, including the Security Association and
   Identification payloads.

   For instance, the IP Security DOI [IPDOI] describes the use of
   ISAKMP in the context of IP Security AH and ESP and the IP
   Compression protocols. The IP Security DOI also includes the
   details for how phase 1 authentication and protection of ISAKMP
   itself is performed between two IP nodes.

   This document defines  the MAPSEC Domain  of Interpretation.
   It reuses ISAKMP for  the  key  management of MAPSEC.  This
   new DOI is essentially an exact copy of how IKE works, except
   that it negotiates other protocols than AH and ESP in Phase 2.
   Also, MAPSEC DOI uses only a subset of all the features in IKE.
   MAPSEC DOI is separated from IKE as a new DOI rather than

INTERNET-DRAFT                 MAPSEC DOI               25 February 2002


   an extension of the current one in order to allow the two
   protocols to have different port numbers, name spaces,
   and change control in the future.

   MAPSEC DOI and the IP Security DOI [IPDOI] are very similar.
   There are only differences with respect to the Phase 2 of
   ISAKMP/IKE. For the definition of all Phase 1 related issues,
   refer to Section 3.4 which requires the same support as defined
   in [IPDOI].

   In Chapter 4,  this  document  defines all Phase 2 related issues
   for the MAPSEC DOI.  In addition, 3GPP  Technical  Specifications
   [NDSEC] specify the actual MAPSEC authentication  and  encryption
   algorithms, as well as  so  called  protection  profiles.  At the
   same time, [NDSEC] defines the values that are used in the MAPSEC
   DOI to refer to these algorithms and profiles. This ensures that
   the MAPSEC DOI document does not have to be modified upon the
   development of a new authentication algorithm, for instance.

   Given  that  a  subset  of IKE  is used  unchanged,  there is  the
   possibility of updating MAPSEC DOI later to use a new protocol (if
   IKE is developed further or  replaced by new protocols).  Such  an
   update  would  involve  making  the new  protocol  allow  security
   negotiation for other protocols than AH and ESP, and allowing
   certain new algorithm identifiers and other parameters.

3.3. Network Architecture

   The MAP Security protocol and its key management part provides
   authentication, confidentiality, integrity, and replay protection
   services to the MAP messages it transports.

   The purpose of the MAP Security header in the protocol is to
   provide enough information to determine the MAP SA and Protection
   Modes used in securing the MAP operation that follows the
   header.

   MAPSEC DOI and IKE are used to set up Security Associations for
   nodes implementing MAPSEC. While the MAP protocol usually runs
   over SS7, the MAPSEC DOI and IKE are always run over IP. It is
   therefore assumed that nodes or networks implementing MAPSEC
   always have IP connectivity in addition to the SS7 connectivity.

   The network architectures where the MAPSEC DOI can be run
   include but are not limited to the one defined by 3GPP [NDSEC].
   In the 3GPP architecture the MAPSEC is typically run between two
   different network operators, and the same SAs are shared by
   a number of NEs.



Arkko & Blom                    Informational           [Page 4]





INTERNET-DRAFT                 MAPSEC DOI               25 February 2002


   As in IKE, the MAPSEC DOI allows only symmetric Security
   Associations to be set up. That is, a pair of SAs is always
   created for the incoming and outgoing directions. These SAs
   differ only with respect to the keys, SPIs, and peer identities
   but all other parameters including the algorithms will have the
   same values.

3.4. Reuse of IPSEC DOI and IKE

   For Phase 1, all IPSEC DOI definitions [IPSDOI] and IKE procedures
   [ISAKMP, IKE] MUST be used unchanged in the MAPSEC DOI, including
   the way that peers are authenticated. However, the  MAP  Security
   DOI  relaxes the full implementation requirements.  The following
   exceptions to the full requirements are used:

     o  All MAPSEC DOI communications shall run on port TBD instead
        of the standard IKE port 500. This applies to both Phase 1
        and 2. Additionally, MAPSEC DOI implementations MUST send
        the value zero in the port field of the identity payload
        during Phase 1 (standard IKE allows either 0 or 500).

     o  Support for Perfect Forward  Secrecy (PFS) is  not  required.
        An implementation that receives a Phase 2 negotiation request
        with PFS on MAY decline the negotiation.

     o  Only one  identity  type,  ID_FQDN,  MUST  be implemented for
        phase 1. Other identity types specified in [IPSDOI] SHOULD be
        implemented.

     o  Only the  AES  encryption  [AESESP]  and SHA-1 hash [IKE]
        algorithms MUST be implemented as ISAKMP encryption and hash
        operations.

   Implementor's note:  IKE [IKE] specifies that all implementations
   MUST  support  authentication   through  pre-shared  secrets  and
   SHOULD    support    public   key   based   authentication.   All
   implementations  also   MUST  support Main  Mode.  Note also that
   IKE  allows  the   deletion   of   an  existing  SA,   which  all
   implementations of this DOI MUST be able to handle.

   Furthermore, the IKE procedures regarding phase 2 are used
   unchanged, with the following exceptions:

        o  Identity types used in phase 2 are different.

        o  SA payloads are different.

        o  There are no MAPSEC-specific phase 2 notifications.

4. Definition

4.1 Naming Scheme

   Within ISAKMP, all DOI's MUST be registered with the IANA in the
   "Assigned Numbers" RFC [STD-2].  The IANA Assigned Number for the
   MAP Security DOI (MAPSEC DOI) is TBD (N).  Within the MAP Security
   DOI, all well-known identifiers MUST be registered with the IANA
   under the MAPSEC DOI.  Unless otherwise noted, all tables within this
   document refer to IANA Assigned Numbers for the MAPSEC DOI.  See
   Section 6 for further information relating to the IANA registry for
   the MAPSEC DOI. The MAPSEC DOI also makes use of several numbers
   defined by the 3GPP Technical Specification [NDSEC].

   All multi-octet binary values are stored in network byte order.

4.2 MAPSEC Situation Definition

   Within ISAKMP, the Situation field provides information that can be
   used by the responder to make a policy determination about how to
   process the incoming Security Association request.  For the MAPSEC
   DOI, the Situation field in Phase 1 is handled as specified by
   the IPSEC DOI [IPSDOI]. In Phase 2, the Situation field is a four
   (4) octet bitmask with the following value.

       Situation                   Value
       ---------                   -----
       SIT_IDENTITY_ONLY           0x01

4.2.1 SIT_IDENTITY_ONLY

   The SIT_IDENTITY_ONLY type specifies that the security association
   will be identified by source identity information present in an
   associated Identification Payload.  See Section 4.6.2 for a complete
   description of the various Identification types.  All MAPSEC DOI
   implementations MUST support SIT_IDENTITY_ONLY by including two
   Identification Payloads in the Phase 2 exchange, and MUST abort
   any association setup that fails to do so.

4.3 MAPSEC Policy Requirements

   The policy requirements for nodes implementing the MAPSEC DOI are
   beyond  the scope of this document.  However, it is required that
   systems  be able to specify  their policies with respect to the MAP
   traffic in terms of so  called  Protection  Profiles as  defined in
   [NDSEC]. These Protection Profiles indicate the need for a particular
   kind of  protection based  on the type of  the MAP message.  For the
   purposes of this document a Protection Profile is a 16 bit number

   that is agreed upon during the SA negotiation.

4.4 MAPSEC Assigned Numbers

   The following sections list the Assigned Numbers for the MAPSEC DOI:
   Protocol  Identifiers,   MAPSEC   Transform   Identifiers,   Security
   Association  Attribute Type Values, ID Payload Type  Values,  and
   Notify  Message Type  Values.

4.4.1 MAPSEC DOI Number

   This number is TBD.

4.4.1 MAPSEC Security Protocol Identifier

   The ISAKMP proposal syntax was specifically designed to allow for the
   simultaneous  negotiation  of  multiple  Phase II  security  protocol
   suites within a single negotiation.  As a result, the protocol suites
   listed below form the set of protocols that can be negotiated at the
   same time.  It is a host policy decision as to what protocol suites
   might be negotiated together.

   The following table lists the values for the Security Protocol
   Identifiers referenced in an ISAKMP Proposal Payload for the MAPSEC
   DOI.

       Protocol ID                         Value
       -----------                         -----
       RESERVED                            0-1
       PROTO_MAPSEC                        TBD

4.4.1.2 PROTO_MAPSEC

   The PROTO_MAPSEC type specifies the use of the MAP Security to
   protect MAP messages.

4.4.2 MAPSEC Transform Identifiers

   The following table lists the reserved MAPSEC Transform
   Identifiers.

       Transform ID                        Value
       ------------                        -----
       RESERVED                            0-1

   Actual  MAP  Transform  Identifiers  are  defined in the 3GPP
   Technical Specification  [NDSEC].

4.5 MAPSEC Security Association Attributes

   The following SA attribute definitions are used in Phase II of an IKE
   negotiation.  Attribute types can be either Basic (B) or Variable-
   Length (V).  Encoding of these attributes is defined in the base
   ISAKMP specification.

   Attributes described as basic MUST NOT be encoded as variable.
   Variable length attributes MAY be encoded as basic attributes if
   their value can fit into two octets.  See [IKE] for further
   information  on  attribute  encoding  in   the   MAPSEC   DOI. All
   restrictions listed in [IKE] also apply to the MAPSEC DOI.

   Implementor's note: The attributes described here behave exactly as
   the corresponding ones in the IPSEC DOI, unless specified explicitly
   otherwise. For the purposes of reusing IPsec DOI code, parameters
   not used by MAPSEC DOI have the type reserved (values 4, 8, and 9).

       Attribute Types

             class               value           type
       -------------------------------------------------
       SA Life Type                1               B

       MAP Protection Profile      100             B
       MAP PP Version Indicator    101             B

       Class Values

         SA Life Type
         SA Duration

           Specifies the time-to-live for the overall security
           association.  When the SA expires, the SA MUST be
           renegotiated. MAPSEC messages using the expired SA
           MUST no longer be either sent or accepted as input.
           The life type values are:

           RESERVED                0
           seconds                 1
           RESERVED                2

INTERNET-DRAFT                 MAPSEC DOI               25 February 2002


           For  a  given  Life  Type,  the value of the  Life Duration
           attribute  defines  the  actual  length  of  the  component
           lifetime  --  in number  of  seconds.  If  unspecified, the
           default value shall be assumed to be 28800 seconds (8 hours).

           An SA Life Duration attribute MUST always follow an SA
           Life Type which describes the units of duration.

           Implementor's note:  The semantics  and  values  for  these
           attributes are exactly as they are in the IPSEC DOI, except
           that kilobyte lifetimes are not supported.

         Group Description

           Specifies  the  Oakley  Group  to  be  used  in  a  PFS  QM
           negotiation. For a list of supported values, see Appendix A
           of [IKE].

           Implementor's note: The semantics and values for these
           attributes are exactly as they are in the IPSEC DOI.

         Authentication Algorithm

           RESERVED                0-4

           This specification only lists the reserved values. Actual
           Authentication Algorithm values are defined in the 3GPP
           Technical Specification [NDSEC].

           There is no default value for Authentication Algorithm, as it
           must be specified to correctly identify the applicable
           transform.

           Implementor's  note:  The first five values are reserved by
           the IPSEC DOI.

         Key Length

           RESERVED                0

           There  is  no  default  value for Key Length, as it must be
           specified for transforms  using  ciphers  with variable key
           lengths.  For fixed length ciphers, the Key Length attribute
           MUST NOT be sent. The definition of MAPSEC transforms in the
           3GPP Technical Specifications such as [NDSEC] MUST specify
           if the use of Key Length is necessary and what the legal
           values are.

INTERNET-DRAFT                 MAPSEC DOI               25 February 2002


           Implementor's  note:  The  semantics  and  values  for   this
           attributes is exactly as it is in the IPSEC DOI.

         Key Rounds

           RESERVED                0

           There is no default value for Key Rounds, as it must be
           specified for transforms using ciphers with varying numbers
           of rounds.

           Implementor's  note:  The  semantics  and  values  for   this
           attributes is exactly as it is in the IPSEC DOI.

         MAP Protection Profile

           The value of this attribute is a 16-bit entity as defined in
           [NDSEC].

         MAP PP Version Indicator

           The Protection Profile Version Indicator allows different
           versions of protection profiles to be used. The value of
           this attribute is a 16-bit entity as defined in [NDSEC].

4.5.1 Required Attribute Support

   To ensure basic interoperability, all implementations MUST be
   prepared to negotiate all of the following attributes.

           SA Life Type
           SA Duration
           Authentication Algorithm
           Key Length
           MAP Protection Profile
           MAP PP Version Indicator

4.5.2 Attribute Negotiation

   If  an  implementation  receives  a defined MAPSEC DOI attribute (or
   attribute value)  which  it  does  not  support,  an  ATTRIBUTES-NOT-
   SUPPORTED SHOULD be sent and the security association setup MUST be
   aborted, unless the attribute value is in the reserved range.

   If  an  implementation  receives  an  attribute value in the reserved
   range, an implementation  MAY  choose  to  continue  based  on  local
policy.

INTERNET-DRAFT                 MAPSEC DOI               25 February 2002


   Implementor's note: This is exactly as it is in the IPSEC DOI.
   However, there are no special lifetime attribute parsing requirements
   as only time-based lifetimes are supported.

4.5.3 Lifetime Matching

   Offered and locally acceptable SA lifetimes must match exactly under
   MAPSEC in order for the responder to select an SA.

   Implementor's note: This is simplified from the IPSEC DOI which
   required notifications. In the MAPSEC DOI lifetime notifications
   are not defined and hence not used.

4.6 MAP Security Payload Content

   The SA Payloads that the Initiator and the Responder exchange control
   the Security Associations that actually get installed. The attributes
   discussed above are a part of the SA Payloads. For a definition of a
   MAPSEC SA, see [NDSEC].

   The following sections describe those ISAKMP payloads whose data
   representations are dependent on the applicable DOI.

4.6.1 Identification Payload Content

   The Identification Payload  is used to  identify the initiator of the
   Security Association.  The  identity of  the initiator SHOULD be used
   by the responder to determine the correct host system security policy
   requirement for the association.

   During Phase I negotiations, the ID port and protocol fields MUST be
   set to zero or to UDP  port 500.  If an implementation receives any
   other values,  this  MUST  be  treated as an error and the security
   association setup MUST be aborted.  This event SHOULD be auditable.

   The following diagram illustrates the content of the Identification
   Payload.

INTERNET-DRAFT                 MAPSEC DOI               25 February 2002


   The Identification Payload fields are defined as follows:

     o  Next Payload (1 octet) - Identifier for the payload type of the
        next payload in the message.  If the current payload is the last
        in the message, this field will be zero (0).

     o  RESERVED (1 octet) - Unused, must be zero (0).

     o  Payload  Length  (2 octets) -  Length,  in  octets,  of  the
        identification data, including the generic header.

     o  Identification Type (1 octet) - Value describing the identity
        information found in the Identification Data field.

     o  Protocol ID (1 octet)  -  Value specifying an associated IP
        protocol ID (e.g. UDP/TCP).  A value of zero means that the
        Protocol ID field should be ignored. In the MAPSEC DOI,
        value of zero MUST always be used in Phase 2.

     o  Port (2 octets) - Value specifying an associated port. A value
        of zero means that the Port field should be ignored. In the
        MAPSEC DOI, value of zero MUST always be used in Phase 2.

     o  Identification Data (variable length) - Value, as indicated by
        the Identification Type.

   The legal  Identification  Type  field  values  in  Phase  1  are as
   defined  in  the  IPSEC  DOI.   However,   Phase 2  identities  MUST
   conform  to  the  following.  The  table  lists  the assigned values
   for  the  Identification  Type  field  found  in  the  Identification
   Payload. (Values from 0 to 11 are reserved by the IPsec DOI for
   the purposes of code reuse.)

       ID Type                   Value
       -------                   -----
       RESERVED                  0-11
       ID_PLMN_ID                12

   In MAPSEC DOI, the ID_PLMN_ID type specifies PLMN ID of the Initiator
   or the Responder.  The  PLMN ID  MUST  be represented as defined in
   section 17.7.8 of [MAP],  i.e. be a three octet data item with the
   Mobile Country Code (MCC) followed by the Mobile Network Code  (MNC).
   The size of the PLMN ID MUST correspond to the size in the ID payload
   header.

4.6.2 Notify Message Types

   There are no DOI-specific Notify Message types for the MAPSEC DOI



Arkko & Blom                    Informational           [Page 12]





INTERNET-DRAFT                 MAPSEC DOI               25 February 2002


   in Phase 2.

   Note however, Phase 1 uses of course standard ISAKMP and IPSEC DOI
   notifications that are defined in section 3.14.1 of [ISAKMP] and
   section 4.6.3 of [IPSDOI], respectively.  Even Phase 2 of the MAPSEC
   DOI uses standard ISAKMP notifications.

   (Implementor's note: The reason why MAPSEC DOI doesn't need the same
   Phase 2 DOI-specific notifications is the following. MAPSEC does not
   allow turning replay protection on or off  which  makes the  use  of
   REPLAY-STATUS unnecessary. Responder lifetimes  are  required  to be
   exactly the same as the initiator  lifetimes, which  makes  the  use
   of RESPONDER-LIFETIME  unnecessary.  INITIAL-CONTACT notification on
   the other hand is used exclusively  in  Phase 1,  and  is  therefore
   applicable also for MAPSEC DOI in Phase 1.)

4.7 MAPSEC Key Exchange Requirements

   The MAPSEC DOI introduces no additional Key Exchange types.

5. Security Considerations

   This entire memo pertains to the Internet Key Exchange protocol
   ([IKE]), which combines ISAKMP ([ISAKMP]) and Oakley ([OAKLEY]) to
   provide  for the derivation  of cryptographic keying material in a
   secure and authenticated manner.  Specific discussion of the various
   security protocols and transforms identified in this document can be
   found in the associated base documents and in the cipher  references.

6. IANA Considerations

   This document contains many "magic" numbers to be maintained by the
   the standardization bodies.  In  the  case  of the MAPSEC DOI, the
   3GPP handles  the  assignment  of  numbers  instead of IANA.  This
   section  explains  the  criteria to be used by the 3GPP to assign
   additional numbers in each of these lists.  All values not explicitly
   defined in previous sections are reserved to 3GPP. (IANA will still
   define the DOI numbers, including the DOI number for this DOI.)

6.1 MAPSEC Situation Definition

   The Situation Definition is a 32-bit bitmask which represents the
   environment under which the MAPSEC SA proposal and negotiation is
   carried out.  Requests for assignments of new situations must be
   accompanied by a 3GPP Technical Specification which describes the
   interpretation for the associated bit.

   The upper two bits are reserved for private use amongst cooperating



Arkko & Blom                    Informational           [Page 13]





INTERNET-DRAFT                 MAPSEC DOI               25 February 2002


   systems.

6.2 MAPSEC Security Protocol Identifiers

   The Security Protocol Identifier is an 8-bit value which identifies a
   security protocol suite being negotiated. Requests for assignments of
   new security protocol identifiers must be accompanied by a 3GPP
   Technical Specification which describes the requested security
   protocol.

   The values 249-255 are reserved for private use amongst cooperating
   systems.

6.3 MAPSEC MAP Security Transform Identifiers

   The MAP Security Transform Identifier is an 8-bit value which
   identifies a particular algorithm to be used to provide security
   protection for MAP messages.  Requests for assignments of new
   transform identifiers must be accompanied by a 3GPP Technical
   Specification which describes how to use the algorithm within the
   framework.

   The values 249-255 are reserved for private use amongst cooperating
   systems.

6.4 MAPSEC Security Association Attributes

   The MAPSEC Security Association Attribute consists of a 16-bit type
   and its associated value.  MAPSEC SA attributes are used to pass
   miscellaneous values between ISAKMP peers.  Requests for assignments
   of new MAPSEC SA attributes must be accompanied by a 3GPP Technical
   Specification which describes the attribute encoding (Basic/Variable-
   Length) and its legal values.  Section 4.5 of this document provides
   an example of such a description.

   The values 32001-32767 are reserved for private use amongst
   cooperating systems.

   Requests for new values for existing attributes must be accompanied
   also by a 3GPP Technical Specification. Such specifications describe
   the semantics of the new values.

6.5 MAPSEC Identification Type

   The MAPSEC Identification Type is an 8-bit value which is used as a
   discriminant for interpretation of the variable-length Identification
   Payload.  Requests for assignments of new Identification Types must
   be accompanied by a 3GPP Technical Specification which describes how



Arkko & Blom                    Informational           [Page 14]





INTERNET-DRAFT                 MAPSEC DOI               25 February 2002


   to use the identification type.

   The values 249-255 are reserved for private use amongst cooperating
   systems.

7. Key Derivation for MAP Security

   MAP Security requires two sets of keys, one for each direction,
   just as in the case of IPSEC SAs. Both need authentication and
   encryption keys. For one direction of an SA, these two keys are
   taken from the key material as follows: The authentication key
   is taken first and then  the encryption key.

   The  keys  are  derived using exactly the same procedure as in
   section 5.5 of RFC 2409 [IKE].

   Implementor's note: The same procedure is used in order to
   ease specification and implementation, but it should be
   noted that one of the parameters to the derivation process,
   protocol, is the constant PROTO_MAPSEC and does not vary
   in negotiations.

8. Modification History

   The following modifications have been made to the -01 and -02
   versions of this draft:

   o  Section 3.5 now specify a profile for the use of IKE.
      Since the -02 version, Main Mode has been mandated,
      and SA deletion has become mandatory.
   o  All MAPSEC-specific phase 2 notifications have been removed
      for simplicity.
   o  AES-MAC has been specified instead of HMAC_SHA1. Note that
      Phase 1 has been specified to use AES and SHA1 since
      no RFC exists yet to define the use of AES-MAC for
      IKE Phase 1.
   o  Some formatting modifications have been made.
   o  Attribute parsing requirements were simplified since
      only a single kind of lifetimes are supported.
   o  MAP_BLOWFISH has been removed since 3GPP hasn't defined it.
   o  MAP_NULL has been removed and protection profiles are
      expected to be used instead to signify that no security
      is needed.
   o  Rules for assigning new numbers within this DOI have
      been clarified. Since -02, it has also been made clear
      which numbers are defined in this document (such as the
      attribute numbers) and which ones are defined in the
      3GPP Technical Specifications (such as the protection



Arkko & Blom                    Informational           [Page 15]





INTERNET-DRAFT                 MAPSEC DOI               25 February 2002


      profile numbers).
   o  Kerberized Internet Negotiation of Keys (KINK) is no
      longer referenced in this document.
   o  Since version -02, ISAKMP protocol and transform identifiers
      have been removed from this document, and the introduction
      clarified to state that this document involves only the
      definition of Phase 2 elements.
   o  Since version -02, the MAPSEC transform, Authentication
      Algorithm, and Protection Profile values have been left
      to be defined by 3GPP Technical Specifications.
   o  References have been completed in version -02.
   o  The format of the PLMN Id has been specified in -02.
   o  In version -02, there are no longer private use value
      space for attribute values.
   o  In version -02, the size of the protection profile
      entity has been specified to be 16 bit.
   o  Version -02 no longer copies the key derivation text
      from IKE, but references it.
   o  Version -02 no longer describes the network architectures
      other than pointing to the 3GPP specifications and noting
      that other archictures are also possible.
   o  In version -02 the mandated notification message types
      have been clarified.
   o  Port and protocol fields in the Identity payload have
      been mandated to be always zero for MAPSEC since version -02.
   o  The use of several key lengths in the context of e.g. AES has
      been clarified in -02.
   o  Section 4.3 has been replaced by a brief policy comment
      since version -02. Possible future requirement to always
      implement certificate handling may have to be accompanied
      by clear specifications on how certificate management has
      to be performed by MAPSEC DOI nodes.
   o  References to the IPSEC DOI, ISAKMP, and IKE requirements
      have been clarified to be relevant for Phase 1 only in
      section 3.5 and 4.6.2.
   o  In version -03, the rules regarding notifications inherited
      from IPsec DOI and ISAKMP have been clarified.
   o  In version -03, several editorial modifications have
      been made.
   o  In version -03, the attribute numbers in MAPSEC DOI
      have been assigned values that are much higher than any
      values currently used by IPsec. This has been done in
      order to facilitiate code reuse by allowing the same
      header files to be used for both MAPSEC DOI and IPSEC
      DOI.
   o  In version -03, the use of certain type of identities
      in Phase 2 has been clarified to be a MUST.
   o  In version -03, it has been clarified that any



Arkko & Blom                    Informational           [Page 16]





INTERNET-DRAFT                 MAPSEC DOI               25 February 2002


      Situation field rules specified here apply only to
      Phase 2.
   o  PFS support has been made optional.
   o  Phase 1 has been clarified to use AES CBC MAC, not SHA1
      in order to streamline all 3GPP protocols to use AES-based
      protocols.
   o  References to the [NDSEC] have been updated to
      note the latest algorithms.
   o  In view of the situation regarding new IKE extensions
      in IETF, the relationship of the MAPSEC DOI to IKE
      has been clarified. It has also been assigned to
      run on a different port than IKE.
   o  Version -04-pa1 clarified the use of the port number field
      in Phase 1.
   o  Version -04-pa1 no longer dictates on which IP version
      MAPSEC DOI runs on. Given that the protocol uses no
      IP addresses anywhere within itself, it makes no
      difference.
   o  Clarified the procedures to use in case IKE will
      be replaced by other protocols in the future in
      version -04.
   o  Took away the incorrect claim in 3.5 that MAPSEC
      key generation and IPsec key generation are different.
   o  Removed the possibility that same Phase 1 could be
      reused between IPsec and MAPSEC.
   o  Reorganized section 3 to be more readable.
   o  Changed again the hash algorithm to SHA-256 from AES-MAC
      given that IANA has not allocated an AES-MAC for IKE,
      and there is no Internet Draft.
   o  Shortened section 3.2.
   o  Version -05 changed the hash algorithm to SHA1 according to
      the decision in S3#21.
   o  A Protection Profile Version Indicator Attribute was
      added in version -05.
