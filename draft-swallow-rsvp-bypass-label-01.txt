1. Introduction

   This document describes the use of RSVP[RFC2205], to establish backup
   tunnels for local repair of LSP tunnels.  The RSVP extensions for
   setting up LSP tunnels are described in [2].

   In order to meet the needs of realtime applications such as Voice
   over IP, it is highly desirable to be able to repair LSP tunnels in
   10s of milliseconds.  We use the term local repair to when referring
   to techniques which accomplish this.  There are two basic strategies
   for effecting local repair.  These are one to one backup and one to
   many backup.

   In the one to one case, a label switched path is established which
   intersects the original tunnel somewhere downstream of the point of
   local repair.  For each LSP which is backed up, another backup LSP is
   established.

          [R1]---[R2]-----[R3]----[R4]---[R5]
                     \           /
                      [R6]---[R7]

   For example, suppose that in the simple topology above, R1 creates a
   tunnel to R5 via the path [R1->R2->R3->R4->R5].  R2 can provide local
   repair by creating a partial backup tunnel [R2->R6->R7->R4] which
   merges with the original tunnel [R1->R2->R3->R4->R5] at R4.

   A second means of backing up LSPs is to take advantage of the label
   stack.  Instead of creating a separate LSP for every backed-up LSP
   tunnel, a single LSP is created which serves to backup up a set of
   tunnels.  We call such a tunnel a bypass tunnel.  The bypass tunnel
   itself is established just like any other LSP tunnel.

   Again the bypass tunnel must intersect the original tunnel(s)
   somewhere downstream of the point of local repair.  This of course
   implies that the set of tunnels being backed up all pass through some
   common downstream node.  All tunnels which pass through the point of
   local repair and through this common node which do not use the
   facilities being bypassed are candidates for this set of tunnels.

   To effect the repair of the backed up tunnels, packets belonging to a
   repaired tunnel are redirected onto the bypass tunnel.  An additional
   label representing the bypass tunnel is stacked onto the redirected
   packets.  At the penultimate hop of the bypass tunnel, the label for
   the bypass tunnel is popped off the stack, revealing the label which
   represents the tunnel being backed up.

   Returning to the above example, R2 in this case would build a bypass

   tunnel [R2->R6->R7->R4].  The doubled lines represent this tunnel.
   The backup path for [R1->R2->R3->R4->R5] again rejoins the original
   path at R4, but its path is now [R1->R2->R4->R5] with the bypass
   tunnel as the connection between R2 and R4.

             [R8]
                 \
           [R1]---[R2]----[R3]----[R4]---[R5]
                      \          //   \                   
                       [R6]===[R7]     [R9]

   The scalability improvement comes in that this bypass tunnel can also
   be a backup for tunnels from any of R1, or R2, R8 to any of R4, R5,
   or R9 which traverse the link R2->R3.


2. Labels for backup tunnels

   In this section we consider the issues of binding labels to these
   various backup entities.  In this discussion we refer to the point of
   local repair as PLR or the PLR node depending on context.  Similarly,
   we refer to the point at which the backup tunnel merges back into the
   original tunnel as the merge point or merge node.  Note that it is
   possible that the merge node is also the tunnel tail.

   In MPLS, a node may have a single label space which is global to the
   node, or it may have multiple label spaces, some of which are
   specific to particular interfaces.

   Whether one to one backup or many to one backup is used, a means for
   obtaining labels which properly represent the backed up tunnels is
   required.

   The simplest case is when the merge node is the next hop of both the
   original tunnel and of the backup tunnel and the merge node has a
   global label space.  In the one to one case this situation would
   arise as follows.  There exist multiple links between the local-
   repair node and the merge node.  An LSP tunnel crosses one of these
   links.  A parallel link will be used as the backup should the primary
   link fail.  Since the merge node is using a global label space, it
   would properly recognize packets which were sent on the parallel
   link.

   In the many to one case, the above situation arises in a more general
   way.  Consider any two neighbor nodes, L and M.  If L wishes to
   backup the tunnels crossing the link to M it could establish a backup
   tunnel to M via any available route which avoids the backed up link.
   Again, since M is using a global label space, to effect the bypass, L

   would simply do the normal label swap, and then push on the label for
   the backup tunnel.  The penultimate hop of the backup tunnel would
   pop the label for the backup tunnel, revealing the label which M
   expects.

   When a failure occurs and the backup comes into use, a means of
   maintaining the RSVP state is required.  In this simple case the Path
   messages can simply be sent via the backup link or tunnel as the case
   may be.

   Except for these specific cases, additional labels must be assigned
   and a means of signaling is required.

   Returning to the bypass tunnel example above, if R4 does not use a
   global label space then a label must be assigned out of the label
   space used by R4 on the interface terminating the link from R7.  if,
   however, R4 has a global label space then the label which R2 uses
   during the backup could be the same label value which is used by R3.

   In the next section we describe a general means of obtaining backup
   labels.  In the following section we describe an efficient means
   communicating labels where global label spaces are used.



3. Signaling for backup tunnels

   A number of objectives must be met to obtain a satisfactory signaling
   solution.  These are summarized as follows:

     1. Unambiguously and uniquely identify backup tunnels
     2. Unambiguously associate primary tunnels with their backup
          tunnels
     3. Work with both global and non-global label spaces
     4. Allow for merging of backup tunnels
     5. Maintain RSVP state during and after fail-over.


3.1. Identification and association of backup LSP tunnels

   LSP tunnels are identified by a combination of the SESSION and
   SENDER_TEMPLATE objects.  The relevant fields are:

      IPv4 tunnel end point address

         IPv4 address of the egress node for the tunnel.

Internet Draft   draft-swallow-rsvp-bypass-label-01.txt    November 2000


      Tunnel ID

         A 16-bit identifier used in the SESSION that  remains  constant
         over the life of the tunnel.

      Extended Tunnel ID

         A 32-bit identifier used in the SESSION that  remains  constant
         over  the  life  of  the  tunnel.   Normally  set to all zeros.
         Ingress nodes that wish to narrow the scope of a SESSION to the
         ingress-egress  pair  may  place  their  IPv4 address here as a
         globally unique identifier.

      IPv4 tunnel sender address

         IPv4 address for a sender node

      LSP ID

         A  16-bit  identifier  used  in  the  SENDER_TEMPLATE  and  the
         FILTER_SPEC  that  can  be  changed  to allow a sender to share
         resources with itself.

   The first three of these are in the SESSION object and are the basic
   identification of the tunnel.  The last two are in the
   SENDER_TEMPLATE.

   The LSP_ID is used to differentiate multiple LSPs during a tunnel
   reroute procedure.  During this procedure, multiple LSPs each with
   their own LSP_ID may be active simultaneously.  It is quite possible
   that a node which is downstream of the point of local repair on the
   LSP being backed up is also upstream of the point of local repair for
   some other LSP associated with the tunnel.  It is thus necessary to
   properly associate the LSP_ID of a backup tunnel with the LSP_ID of
   the tunnel being backed up.

   We therefore propose that backup tunnels be identified as follows.
   The SESSION object and the LSP_ID are copied from the LSP tunnel
   being backed up.  The IPv4 tunnel sender address is set to an address
   of the PLR node.  If the head-end of a tunnel is also acting as the
   PLR, it must choose an IP address different from the one used in the
   SENDER_TEMPLATE of the original LSP tunnel.

3.2. ERO contents

   The PLR creates an ERO for the backup LSP tunnel.  It does this by
   operating on the original ERO or on the contents of a received RRO.
   Abstract nodes which precede the merge point are removed.  In the
   case of signaling over a bypass tunnel, the procedure is now
   complete.  In the one-to-one backup case the, an explicit route from
   the PLR node to the merge node is prepended to the ERO.



4. Efficient signaling for the global label case

   When global labels are in use and bypass tunnels are used as the
   means of local repair, a more efficient means of backup label
   distribution can be employed.  When using a bypass tunnel, the backed
   up tunnels are only one LSP hop from rejoining their primary LSPs.
   If the merge node is using a global label space, then the label
   necessary for the back up tunnel is the label already assigned by the
   merge node.

   By using the label record option of the ROUTE_RECORD procedure,
   downstream labels can be known by upstream nodes without further
   protocol interactions.  In this case no Path message is sent down the
   bypass tunnel prior to a failure.  When a failure occurs, the PLR
   updates the ERO as above and begins refreshing the LSP down the
   bypass tunnel.  This ensures that the LSP state is refreshed in the
   merge node and nodes further downstream.



5. Notification of local repair

   In many situations, the route used during a local repair will be less
   than optimal.  The point of the local repair is to keep high priority
   and loss sensitive traffic flowing while a more optimal rerouting of
   the tunnel can be effected by the head-end of the tunnel.  Thus the
   head-end needs to know of the failure.

   To provide this notification, the point of local repair SHOULD send a
   PathErr message with error code of "Notify" and an error value of
   "Notification of local repair".

6. Security Considerations

   These procedures do not change the trust model of RSVP [RFC2205] and
   draft-ietf-mpls-rsvp-tunnel-07.txt[RSVP-TE].  As such no additional
   security risks are posed.
