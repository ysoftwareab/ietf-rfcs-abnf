Notification Capabilities Model Extension for self-explanation data Node
                         tag capability support
            draft-tao-netconf-notif-node-tag-capabilities-00

Abstract

   Before a client application subscribes to updates from a datastore,
   server capabilities related to "Subscription to YANG Datastores" can
   be advertised using YANG Instance Data format.  These server
   capabilities can be documented at implement time or reported at run-
   time.

   This document proposes a YANG module for Data Node tag capability
   support which augments YANG Push Notification Capabilities model and
   provide additional self-explanation data node attributes associated
   with node selector within per-node capabilities.

1.  Introduction

   As described in [I-D.netconf-notification-capabilities], a server
   supporting YANG-Push MAY have a number of capabilities such as

   o  Supported (reporting) periods for periodic subscriptions

   o  Maximum number of objects that can be sent in an update

   o  Supported dampening periods for on-change subscriptions

   o  The set of data nodes for which on-change notification is
      supported

   Notification capability model defined in [I-D.netconf-notification-
   capabilities] allows a client to discover YANG-Push related
   capabilities both at implementation-time and run-time.  Without using
   notification capability, it might lead to unexpected failure or
   additional message exchange for NETCONF clients to discover data
   models supported by a NETCONF server.

   When the state of all subscriptions of a particular Subscriber to be
   fetched is huge, filtering queries of operational state on a server
   based on server capabilities can greatly reduce the amount of data to
   be streamed out to the destination.

   However without self-explanation information on data node conveyed in
   Notification capability model [I-D.netconf-notification-
   capabilities], it is hard for NETCONF clients to automatically select
   which data objects are of interest using machine to machine
   interface, e.g., identify a set of objects which have a common
   characteristic, collect specific object type nodes.

   This document proposes a YANG module for Data Node tag capability
   support which augments YANG Push Notification Capabilities model and
   provide additional self-explanation data node tag attributes
   associated with node selector for queries filtering.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Notification Capability Model Extension

   The YANG module ietf-notification-capabilities defined in [I-
   D.netconf-notification-capabilities] specify the following server
   capabilities related to YANG Push:

   o  a set of capabilities related to the amount of notifications the
      server can send out

   o  specification of which data nodes support on-change notifications.

   o  Capability values can be specified on server level, datastore
      level or on specific data nodes (and their contained sub-tree) of
      a specific datastore.  Capability values on a smaller, more
      specific part of the server's data always override more generic
      values.

   o  On-change capability is not specified on a server level as
      different datastores usually have different on-change
      capabilities.  On a datastore level on-change capability for
      configuration and state data can be specified separately.

   These server capabilities can be provided either at implementation
   time or reported at run time.

   This document augments YANG Push Notification Capabilities model and
   provide additional data node attributes associated with node selector
   within per-node capabilities:

   o  specification of which object type nodes they can push to the
      target recipient.

   o  specification of which group of data nodes they can push to the
      target recipient.

4.2.  Updates to the YANG Module Names Registry

   This document registers one YANG module in the "YANG Module Names"
   registry [RFC6020].  Following the format in [RFC6020], the following
   registration has been made:

   name:
      ietf-notification-node-tag-capabilities

   namespace:
      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-notification-node-tag-capabilities

   prefix:
      nntc

   reference:
      RFC XXXX (RFC Ed.: replace XXX with actual RFC number and remove
      this note.)

5.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive in some
   network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config) to these
   data nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:
