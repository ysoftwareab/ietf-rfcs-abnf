Abstract 
 
Nowadays, Internet offers different information and communication  
services (web pages, email, file transfer, IP telephony, ...). The use  
of those services increases significantly. Internet trends to become  
the major multimedia and communication application support. On the  
other side, PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) services are  
commonly used with high quality, performance and security , and they  
evolve with a lot of value added services (free call, call waiting,  
vocal mail, ...). But today, there are few interactions between  
Internet services and PSTN services. In that way, it is very  
interesting to develop new services which offer synergy as defined  
by the PSTN / Internet Inter-Networking (PINT) working group. 
Internet and PSTN are considered to be two different business  
domains. So, it is necessary to identify the interfaces for the  
interworking. 
The TINA (Telecommunication Information Networking Architecture)  
architecture is a common software architecture for information and  
telecommunication services, defined by the TINA consortium. The  
architecture is applicable to different services (telephony, video  
on demand, Web, ...) and different transport networks (IP, PSTN, ATM,  
...).   
This internet draft is about the use of TINA architecture in the  
development of a common control platform for the Internet / PSTN  
interworking. Our aim is to apply TINA service architecture for both  
internet and PSTN service platforms in order to allow interactions. 
 
The TINA architecture is first introduced. The architecture of our  
experiment is described ; and the relevant contributions for PINT  
are identified.

1   Introduction 
 
The objective of the PINT WG is to define an architecture and a  
protocol, considering security issues, to offer services like click- 
to-dial, click-to-fax. In reference to the figure 1, The PINT  
protocol (1) is independent of the underlying network functions (2)  
which could be IN, with INAP (Intelligent Network Application  
Protocol) interface, or PBX (Private Automatic Branch eXchange),  
with CTI (Computer Telephony Integration) interface. In the context  
of the PINT charter, this draft consists in identifying how the TINA  
service architecture can be used to offer a protocol to control the  
public switched telephone network services from the internet.

The TINA architecture has been specified by the TINA-C consortium.  
Its main objectives were to define a common software architecture to  
increase the development of new telecommunication and information  
services, along with service synergy. Three architectures are  
defined : the service architecture, the network architecture and the  
DPE (Distributed Processing Environment) architecture. In the PINT  
context, the service architecture [1] is more precisely described. 
  
In our experiment, two different gateways were developed in order to  
interact with an IN equipment and with a PBX equipment. The  
interface between the internet client and the TINA platform, which  
is needed for the PINT protocol, is highlighted.  
 
 
2.  TINA architecture 
 
Architecture 
TINA business model defines the different domains related to  
information and communication services, and particularly : consumer,  
retailer, connectivity provider and third party service provider.  
	 			 
  _________	    ________	    ___________________________ 
 |Consumer |	   |Retailer|	   |3rd party service provider | 
  ---------	   ----------	    --------------------------- 
		 ______________________ 
		|Connectivity Provider | 
		 ---------------------- 
 
In addition, it identifies and specifies reference points between  
domains. The protocol between the internet client and the PINT  
platform relates to the Consumer/Retailer reference point in order  
to establish a secure access and to initiate the usage of service ;  
and a usage relationship between Consumer and 3rd party service  
provider is used for the service logic execution. 
 
The TINA service architecture defines the concept of access and  
usage. The access part includes the messages to initiate a session  
as a secure and authenticated relationship. Then, the access session  
controls the context of the access and the relative consumer profile  
in order to request services. One example is the access to an  
Internet Access Provider. 
 
The usage part concerns the way to control the usage of a service  
and to support management capabilities like accounting. It is  
included in a service session. It is split in generic interfaces  
which are common for different types of services (multi-parties  
control, accounting, ...) and in service logic specific interfaces.  
One example is the request of a Video-conference service. 
 
If the service execution needs explicit usage of network resources,  
in order to exchange information flows, then it sets up a  
communication session. The communication session manages the logical  
link with network resources, independently of the underlying  
network. One example is the setup of an ISDN link for video and  
audio transport. 
 
The TINA service architecture defines the service components for the  
above functions. They are specified with the language IDL/OMG  
(Interface Definition Language of the Object Management Group). It  
allows to define the architecture independently of the different  
technologies for the implementation (operating system, language,  
network, ...). 
 
 
3.  Internet / PSTN architecture experiment  
 
The TINA service architecture is applicable to the domains of  
Internet and PSTN/IN. The experiment has been completed for the Tina  
Test Trial. The TINA Test Trial is a project involving Global One  
partners (DT, FT, Sprint and Global One) and aiming at validating  
the TINA concepts and architecture through a large-scale prototype  
(France, Germany and USA). This project started at the beginning of  
1997. A prototype is available now. 
 
One of the advantages of TINA architecture is that service  
components are deployed on a same control network and they can  
interact as their interfaces are open. In the context of the PINT  
services, the interaction consists in giving access to the PSTN / IN  
services through the internet. The architecture is as below :  
 
PS : Programmable Switch 
VP : Voice Peripheral 
(1)  IIOP 
(2)  HTTP 
(3)  VP API / Corba gateway 
(4)  INAP-like / Corba gateway 
(5)  CTI / Corba gateway

Figure 2. Experiment Architecture 
 
The access is under the control of a TINA platform which identifies  
and authenticates the user. Depending on the access terminal (PC,  
phone, ...) and on the user profile and authorization, services are  
made available : electronic mail, web service, call completion,  
voice mail, ...  
 
The platform allows the use of services like click-to-dial and  
voice-access-to-content. And in order to control the different  
network equipments, a gateway between IIOP and a programmable switch  
with INAP-like protocol (4) and a gateway between IIOP and a pbx  
with CTI protocol (5) are deployed. 
 
Infrastructure 
TINA service components are deployed on a DPE (Distributed  
Processing Environment) platform. The DPE is Corba 2.0 (Common  
Object Request Broker Architecture) compliant. In addition, the use  
of CORBA2.0 interoperability architecture, namely GIOP (Generic  
Inter-ORB Protocol) specialized as IIOP (Internet Inter-ORB  
Protocol) over TCP/IP, offers universal signaling protocol for all  
component interactions and provides transparent distribution  
depending on traffic, load balancing or users locations, ...  
Indeed, if the user's terminal is 'intelligent' (i.e. off-the- 
shelves terminals with 'Java/Corba' capabilities) then it can  
execute some service components and interact directly with the  
control platform. The use of a protocol like Corba2.0 allows to  
offer secure and transactional features as the session persists  
while the link between a client and an object server is still  
active. This is difficult to achieve with a protocol like HTTP which  
is a native stateless protocol for the request of hypertext document  
and which has not been designed to specify interactions for  
controlling the access to networks and services. In the case of a  
dump terminal, gateways can be deployed in the network and be used  
on its behalf. 
 
For the internet access, the application protocol between the  
terminal and the TINA platform are IIOP (1) or HTTP (2). In the case  
of HTTP, a gateway is used to translate HTTP messages into IIOP  
messages and to maintain the access session context. 
 
Scenario 
 
Click-to-Dial scenario 
An example of service is a web-based phone directory. The user is  
connected to the platform and consulting a directory in order to  
find the callee reference. He can click a button to request a call  
completion.  
The service request is sent to the TINA platform. It checks the  
authorization and a service session is created. Then the service  
identifies the user phone number with his profile and requests the  
call setup with the callee, from a communication session manager. As  
the control platform is distributed (DT, FT, Sprint control points),  
and depending on call parties locations, the communication session  
manager can control network functions in an optimized way. In  
addition, the call status can be delivered to the client and  
information can be managed, such as the billing party, date/time to  
complete the call, ...  
 
 
Voice access to web content scenario 
 
As in the previous scenario, the user is connected to the platform  
and consults a web page. A specific request can establish a phone  
call with the user and send the voice translation of the HTML page. 
The service request is sent to the TINA platform which checks the  
authorization and starts a service session. The service identifies  
the user phone number with his profile and requests the call setup,  
with a voice peripheral, from a communication session manager. The  
communication session manager controls the network functions. When  
the call is set up, the service session requests the translation of  
the page content, that is played by the voice peripheral. 
 
 
4.  Service components of the experiment 
Access : 
The interfaces of the access part are the ones defined in the Ret  
reference point [2]. It concerns the interactions between the  
consumer domain and the retailer domain : secure access  
initialization, identification & authentication, request of service  
session and authorization checking, ... 
 
usage :  
The usage of a service is under the control of a service session.  
The interfaces defined for the PINT services are specific to our  
experiment.  
But the goal is not to define a new protocol. PINT protocol will be  
defined from the SIP/SDP (Session Initiation Protocol / Session  
Description Protocol). In fact, our view is to contribute to define  
those service usage interfaces based on SIP for example, ie to  
define the IDL interfaces which correspond to the SIP messages. The  
difference is not so important since the service invitation  
interfaces in the Ret reference point are defined according to the  
SIP standard. 
 
The figure below summarizes the interfaces for the PINT context.

5.  Conclusion 
The aims of our experiment were to develop a platform prototype of  
TINA service architecture for Internet and PSTN access and to  
identify its interest to offer synergy between Internet and PSTN  
services. 
 
One output of the experiment is that a common architecture, TINA,  
can be used for different domains : Internet and IN. Also, the  
conformity to reference points allows different control platforms  
(DT, FT, Sprint) to cooperate. In addition, the use of the Corba  
architecture allows to define a service component by their  
interfaces and then to offer their access through a common  
communication protocol which is independent of its location and the  
underlying infrastructure. It enables an easy interworking between  
Internet and PSTN services. 
  
Then, our contributions are about security, interface and protocol  
issues.  
The access part interfaces are defined by the Ret reference point.  
The usage part interfaces could be defined by IDL interfaces from  
SIP/SDP messages.  
The security concerns first a secure identification and  
authentication relative to the access session, and secondly, the  
authorization for the service usage. 
In the experiment, the IIOP protocol is used to offer a common  
service interaction protocol.
