Abstract 

This document defines an extension to the Real-Time Protocol RTP [1] 
for Communication Resource Priority (CRP). The intent of this extension 
is to give a relative preferential order to RTP packets moving through 
an infrastructure within a Domain whose infrastructure recognizes this 
extension.

1.0	Introduction

This document defines an extension to the Real-Time Protocol RTP [1] 
for Communication Resource Priority (CRP). The intent of this extension 
is to give a relative preferential order to RTP packets moving through 
an infrastructure within a Domain whose infrastructure recognizes this 
extension. With this CRP extension, some packets therefore will receive 
preferential treatment by the underlying and supporting infrastructure 
relative to other CRP-enabled RTP packets. Some CRP-enabled packets 
will be of equal value and receive no distinguishable or preferential 
treatment relative to others at the same level. 

The packet treatment mechanism within this extension is independent of 
L3 mechanisms such as Diffserv [2] and RSVP [3], and might be used in 
conjunction with either, both, or others, including L2 mechanisms. The 
usage of this interaction is outside the scope of this document. 

The CRP marking of RTP packets isn't to give absolute levels of behavior 
or treatment, merely relative behavior or treatment transiting a single 
infrastructure node at a time. No symmetrical session awareness will be 
defined here within the Domain.


2.0 Communications Resource Priority RTP Extension

Below is the Extension to all CRP-enabled RTP Headers (inserted 
immediately after the CSRC if utilized within a packet, otherwise 
immediately after the SSRC):

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |      defined by profile       |           length              |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Figure 1. Extension layout

 Extension Type:   16 bits -- [1] states only one extension can exist in 
                              any packet.

Internet Draft     RTP Ext for Comm Resource Priority     Nov 14th, 2001


 Length:           16 bits -- [1] allows this value to be zero if no 
                              further bits are required to satisfy this 
                              extension, and none do.

 Reserved:         16 bits -- [1] states this field shall not be utilized

 CRP:              16 bits -- See Table 1 above for this value
       

Per [1 in section 5.3.1], "This mechanism is designed so that the header 
extension may be ignored by other interoperating implementations that 
have not been extended", ensuring backwards compatibility with this new 
extension.

The following is the relative priority of the new values of this CRP 
extension for RTP packets:

   Hex  Dec  Name
   ---  ---  ----
   001 - 1 - CRITIC/ECP
   010 - 2 - Flash Override
   011 - 3 - Flash
   100 - 4 - Immediate
   101 - 5 - Priority
   110 - 6 - Routine

   Table 1. CRP levels

This is a reduced list taken from [4], but inverted in value/numeric/bit
/name order here. These Priority Levels coincide with the new draft [5] 
into the SIP WG for their signaling of RTP sessions between UA's, with 
one caveat.

The specific use of the "CRITIC/ECP" ("Critical and Emergency Call 
Priority") value is outside the scope this document, but it is RECOMMENDED 
that this value or level not be used between endpoints other than that 
of a regional/national emergency *and* by Government (authorized) 
individuals only. Related work is occurring to define this value's scope 
within the International Emergency Preparedness Scheme (IEPS) folks [6] 
that are trying to get a WG formed within the IETF.

The CRITIC/ECP level here should map directly to the IAM SS7 code point 
for "authorized emergency" service.

The order of relative Priority of the list in Table 1 has "001 û 1 û 
CRITC/ECP" as the Highest Priority, descending in linear order of Pri-
ority to "110 û 6 û Routine". Routine is RECOMMENED as the default for 
what's usually considered normal, everyday communications. The method 
for elevation of any sessions higher in Priority from Routine is outside 
the scope of this document.

Initial extension inclusion may be generated at endpoints (ex through 
SIP UA's or Gateway signaling to endpoints or terminations) or IP entry 
points (Edge Routers) into the CRP-enabled Domain.

This extension may be inserted by GSTN Gateways entering an IP-Domain 
to achieve a desired treatment within that infrastructure. Certain IP-
domains likely will mandate this extension within their domain.


3.0 Communications Resource Priority in RTCP

*** note û this section needs recommendations for format and normative 
           language

Same levels as in Table 1 above


4.0 Security Considerations

If all devices utilizing RTP within an IP-Managed Domain use authenti-
cated access to the infrastructure, there should not be any security 
considerations.

Misuse of this extension in domains that have preferential treatment of 
packets can cause troubles and unfairness within that domain if 
authentication and authorization is not closely administered. Admission 
controls and effective policing strategies are necessary to prevent this 
starving of resources that can be overtaken with Prioritized traffic. 
Exact methods are outside the scope of this document.


5.0 IANA Considerations

Include this CRP Extension as the first for RTP, with a value of 1
