translator-parameter = art / fluency / future-extension

art                  = "Human" / "Machine" / "Original"

fluency              = "Expert" / "Native" / "Other"

Human    = Translation was made or revised/approved by a human
            translator.

Machine  = Translation was entirely automatic, with no human
            checking of the translation. In this case, the
            "Auto-Submitted" [8] header should also be added
            to the message heading.

Original = This is the original before translation. Absence
            of a "Content-Translator" also indicates that the
            message is not translated, but
            "Content-Translator: None;Original" can be
            used to explicitly specify that this is not
            translated.

Expert   = Translation was made by an expert translator or
            by an expert in the topic of the message, such as a
            medical expert for a message on a medical topic.

Native   = Translation was made by a native speaker of the
            target language.


Other    = Translation was made by someone who is not an
            expert nor a native speaker of the target language.
