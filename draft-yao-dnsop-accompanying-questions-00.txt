   A DNS Query including A Main Question with Accompanying Questions
               draft-yao-dnsop-accompanying-questions-00

Abstract

   This document enables DNS initiators to send a main question
   accompanying with several related questions in a single DNS query,
   and enables DNS responders to put the answers into a single DNS
   response.  This mechanism can reduce the number of DNS round-trips
   per application work-unit.

1.  Introduction

   There are many scenarios in which an application must send several
   related questions to a DNS responder.  For examples, when asking
   about a QTYPE=A RRset, a QTYPE=AAAA RRset may also be of use; When
   asking for an A RRset, an MX RRset might also be of interest; When
   asking for some RRset of example.com, records of a sub-domain name
   such as www.example.com may be of interest.

   Query example.com for A and AAAA

   Query example.com for A and MX

   Query example.com for A and www.example.com for A

   This document describes a method by which DNS initiators can send a
   main question accompanying with several related questions in a single

   DNS query, and enables DNS responders place all related answers into
   a single DNS response.  This mechanism can reduce the number of DNS
   round-trips per application work-unit, by carrying several related
   queries in a single query transaction.

2.  Terminology

   The basic key words such as "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "MAY", and "MAYNOT" are to be interpreted as
   described in [RFC2119].

   The basic DNS terms used in this specification are defined in the
   documents [RFC1034] and [RFC1035].

3.  Mechanism for a main question with accompanying questions

   The initiator still puts a main question into the question section of
   the DNS query packet, as described in [RFC1035].  Accompanying
   questions will be put into the variable part of an OPT RR [RFC6891].

   A new UAQ (Understand Accompanying Questions) bit in the EDNS flags
   field [RFC6891] signals that the initiator may have included
   accompanying questions in OPT RR of EDNS0.

   If the query has accompanying questions, the accompanying questions
   enabled initiators MUST set the UAQ bit in the query.  The AQ aware
   responder receiving the UAQ bit will indicate in the UAQ bit of the
   response whether it implements this specification.  [EDIT: Should we
   just use the presence of an AQ OPT, without also adding a UAQ flag
   bit, to indicate the use of the AQ feature?  We can discuss it in WG
   if this document is adopted.]

   Below are Updated EDNS extended RCODE and Flags fields [RFC6891]:


                  +0 (MSB)                +1 (LSB)
         +--+---+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

         +--+---+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+



   The variable part of an OPT RR is encoded in its RDATA and is
   structured as the following:

   o  AQ field indicates whether this accompanying question is the first
      question.  If it is set as 1, this question is the first question.

   o  Count/Seq field represents the sequence number of accompanying
      questions from 1 to 7 or the total numbers of all accompanying
      questions.  If AQ is set as 0, the Count/Seq will represent the
      sequence number of this accompanying question.  If AQ is set as 1,
      the Count/Seq will represent the total numbers of all accompanying
      questions.  There will have at most 8 accompanying questions.

   o  AQ-RCODE field will be set to 111111110100 bits when being
      initialized.  The AQ-RCODE with the value of 111111110100 bits
      means that the mechanism for accompanying has not been
      implemented.  The AQ aware responders will put the RCODE value for
      the query of this question into AQ-RCODE fields.

   o  Accompanying Question field is a question, in the format of a
      "question" as defined in section 4.1.2 of RFC1035, shown below.
      Within the QNAME, label compression pointers may be used.

4.  Responder Processing

   The AQ aware responder will check the main question first, and put
   the results into the DNS response packet.  If the UAQ bit is set
   [EDIT: or perhaps, if the AQ OPT is present], the responder checks
   the accompanying questions in order, and put the results into the DNS
   answer section of the response following RFC 1034; but the response
   code is placed in the respective AQ-RCODE field in AQ OPT of the
   response.  The RCODE field in the DNS response header refers to the
   main question only.  An AQ unaware responder is expected to ignore
   the UAQ bit and the AQ OPT of the query, and may echo the received
   OPT back into additional section of the response message.

5.  Initiator Processing

   An AQ aware initiator will put the main question into the question
   section of the DNS query packet, and put related accompanying
   questions into the Accompanying Question fields of OPTION-DATA of OPT
   RR.  AQ-RCODE value will be sent as 111111110100 bits.  The AQ value
   should be set to 1 and Count/Seq value should be set to total number
   of accompanying questions if the accompanying question is the first
   one; For other accompanying questions, the AQ value should be set to
   0 and Count/Seq value should be set to the sequence of the
   accompanying questions. The UAQ bit should also be set when
   sending accompanying questions. If the initial value of the AQ-
   RCODE is unchanged in the response, it indicates that the responder
   is AQ unaware.  In that case, the responder will deal with the main
   question only.  The initiator should sent the accompanying questions
   one by one via the normal DNS query.  In such followup related
   queries, AQ processing should probably not be attempted, to reduce
   waste of network resources.

6.  Query and Response Example

     Example: one main question with 2 accompanying questions

       The query would look like:
