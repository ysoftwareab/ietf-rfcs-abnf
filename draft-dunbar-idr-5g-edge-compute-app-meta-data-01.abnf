      Load-i: Load Index at Site-i, it is the weighted
      combination of the total packets or/and bytes sent to and
      received from the Application Server at Site-i during a
      fixed time period.

      CP-i: capacity index at the site I, higher value means
      higher capacity.

      Delay-i: Network latency measurement (RTT) to the A-ER that
      has the Application Server attached at the site-i.

      Pref-i: Preference index for the site-i, higher value means
      higher preference.

      w: Weight for load and site information, which is a value
      between 0 and 1. If smaller than 0.5, Network latency and
      the site Preference have more influence; otherwise, Server
      load and its capacity have more influence.



   3.4. BGP Protocol Extension to advertise Load & Capacity

   Goal of the protocol extension:



Type =TBD2: Aggregated Load Measurement Index derived from
Index=w1*ToPackets+w2*FromPackes+w3*ToBytes+w4*FromBytes

Type= TBD3: Raw measurements of packets/bytes to/from the
