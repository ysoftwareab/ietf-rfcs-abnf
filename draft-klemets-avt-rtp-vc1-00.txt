1.   Introduction 
    
   The bit stream syntax for compressed video in Video Codec 1 (VC-1) 
   format is defined by SMPTE 421M [1]. SMPTE 421M also specifies 
   constraints that must be met by VC-1 conformant bit streams, and it 
   specifies the complete process required to decode the bit stream. 
   However, it does not specify the VC-1 compression algorithm, thus 
   allowing for different ways to implement a VC-1 encoder. 
    
   The VC-1 bit stream syntax has three profiles. Each profile has 
   specific bit stream syntax elements and algorithms associated with 
   it.  Depending on the application in which VC-1 is used, some 
   profiles may be more suitable than others.  For example, the Simple 
   profile is designed for low bit rate Internet streaming and for 
   playback on devices that can only handle low complexity decoding.  
   The Advanced profile is designed for broadcast applications, such as 
   digital TV, HD DVD or HDTV.  The Advanced profile is the only VC-1 
   profile that supports interlaced video frames.

1.1    Conventions used in this document 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [2]. 
    
2.   Definitions and abbreviations 
    
   This document uses the definitions in SMPTE 421M [1].  For 
   convenience, the following terms from SMPTE 421M are restated here: 
    
   B-picture: A picture that is coded using motion compensated 
   prediction from past and/or future reference fields or frames.  A B-
   picture cannot be used for predicting any other picture.  
    
   Bit-stream data unit (BDU): A unit of the compressed data which may 
   be parsed (i.e., syntax decoded) independently of other information 
   at the same hierarchical level.  A BDU can be, for example, a 
   sequence layer header, an entry-point segment header, a frame, or a 
   slice. 
    
   Encapsulated BDU (EBDU): A BDU which has been encapsulated using the 
   encapsulation mechanism described in Annex E of SMPTE 421M [1], to 
   prevent emulation of the start code prefix in the bit stream. 
    
   Entry-point: A point in the bit stream that offers random access. 
    
   frame: A frame contains lines of spatial information of a video 
   signal.  For progressive video, these lines contain samples starting 
   from one time instant and continuing through successive lines to the 
   bottom of the frame.  For interlaced video, a frame consists of two 
   fields, a top field and a bottom field.  One of these fields will 
   commence one field period later than the other. 
    
   interlace: The property of frames where alternating lines of the 
   frame represent different instances in time.  In an interlaced frame, 
   one of the fields is meant to be displayed first. 
    
   I-picture: A picture coded using information only from itself.  
    
   level: A defined set of constraints on the values which may be taken 
   by the parameters (such as bit rate and buffer size) within a 
   particular profile.  A profile may contain one or more levels.

   P-picture: A picture that is coded using motion compensated 
   prediction from past reference fields or frames. 
    
   picture: For progressive video, a picture is identical to a frame, 
   while for interlaced video, a picture may refer to a frame, or the 
   top field or the bottom field of the frame depending on the context. 
    
   profile: A defined subset of the syntax of VC-1, with a specific set 
   of coding tools, algorithms, and syntax associated with it.  There 
   are three VC-1 profiles: Simple, Main and Advanced. 
    
   progressive: The property of frames where all the samples of the 
   frame represent the same instance in time. 
    
   random access: A random access point in the bit stream is defined by 
   the following guarantee: If decoding begins at this point, all frames 
   needed for display after this point will have no decoding dependency 
   on any data preceding this point, and are also present in the 
   decoding sequence after this point.  A random access point is also 
   called an entry-point. 
    
   sequence: A coded representation of a series of one or more pictures.  
   In VC-1 Advanced profile, a sequence consists of a series of one or 
   more entry-point segments, where each entry-point segment consists of 
   a series of one or more pictures, and where the first picture in each 
   entry-point segment provides random access.  In VC-1 Simple and Main 
   profiles, the first picture in each sequence is an I-picture. 
    
   slice: A consecutive series of macroblock rows in a picture, which 
   are encoded as a single unit.  
    
   start codes (SC): 32-bit codes embedded in that coded bit stream that 
   are unique, and identify the beginning of a BDU.  Start codes consist 
   of a unique three-byte Start Code Prefix (SCP), and a one-byte Start 
   Code Suffix (SCS). 
    
3.   Overview of VC-1 
    
   The VC-1 bit stream syntax consists of three profiles: Simple, Main, 
   and Advanced.  The Simple and Main profiles are designed for 
   relatively low bit rate applications.  For example, the maximum bit 
   rate supported by the Simple profile is 384 kbps.  To help achieve 
   high compression efficiency, certain features such as non-square 
   pixels and support for interlaced pictures, are only included in the 
   Advanced profile. 
    
   The maximum bit rate supported by the Advanced profile is 135 Mbps, 
   making it suitable for nearly lossless encoding of HDTV signals.

             RTP Payload Format for Video Codec 1 (VC-1)    July 2005 
 
 
   Only the Advanced profile supports carrying user-data (meta-data) in-
   band with the compressed bit stream.  The user-data can be used for 
   closed captioning support, for example.   
    
   Of the three profiles, only the Advanced profile allows codec 
   configuration parameters, such as the picture aspect ratio, to be 
   changed through in-band signaling in the compressed bit stream. 
    
   For each of the profiles, a certain number of "levels" have been 
   defined.  Unlike a "profile", which implies a certain set of features 
   or syntax elements, a "level" is a set of constraints on the values 
   of parameters in a profile, such as the bit rate or buffer size.  The 
   VC-1 Simple profile has two levels, the Main profile has three, and 
   the Advanced profile has five levels.  See Annex D of SMPTE 421M [1] 
   for a detailed list of the profiles and levels. 
    
3.1    VC-1 bit stream layering model 
    
   The VC-1 bit stream is defined as a hierarchy of layers.  This is 
   conceptually similar to the notion of a protocol stack of networking 
   protocols.  The outermost layer is called the sequence layer.  The 
   other layers are entry-point, picture, slice, macroblock and block. 
    
   In the Simple and Main profiles, a sequence in the sequence layer 
   consists of a series of one or more coded pictures.  In the Advanced 
   profile, a sequence consists of one or more entry-point segments, 
   where each entry-point segment consists of a series of one or more 
   pictures, and where the first picture in each entry-point segment 
   provides random access.  A picture is decomposed into macroblocks.  A 
   slice comprises one or more contiguous rows of macroblocks. 
    
   The entry-point and slice layers are only present in the Advanced 
   profile.  In the Advanced profile, the start of each entry-point 
   layer segment indicates a random access point.  In the Simple and 
   Main profiles each I-picture is a random access point.  
    
   Each picture can be coded as an I-picture, P-picture, skipped 
   picture, BI-picture, or as a B-picture.  These terms are defined in 
   section 2 of this document and in section 4.12 of SMPTE 421M [1]. 
    
3.2    Bit-stream Data Units in Advanced profile 
    
   In the Advanced profile only, each picture and slice is byte-aligned 
   and is considered a Bit-stream Data Unit (BDU).  A BDU is defined as 
   a unit that can be parsed (i.e., syntax decoded) independently of 
   other information in the same layer.   
    
   The beginning of a BDU is signaled by an identifier called Start Code 
   (SC).  Sequence layer headers and entry-point segment headers are

             RTP Payload Format for Video Codec 1 (VC-1)    July 2005 
 
 
   also BDUs and thus can be easily identified by their Start Codes.  
   See Annex E of SMPTE 421M [1] for a complete list of Start Codes.  
   Note that blocks and macroblocks are not BDUs and thus do not have a 
   Start Code and are not necessarily byte-aligned. 
    
   The Start Code consists of four bytes.  The first three bytes are 
   0x00, 0x00 and 0x01. The fourth byte is called the Start Code Suffix 
   (SCS) and it is used to indicate the type of BDU that follows the 
   Start Code.  For example, the SCS of a sequence layer header (0x0F) 
   is different from the SCS of an entry-point segment header (0x0E).  
   The Start Code is always byte-aligned and is transmitted in network 
   byte order. 
    
   To prevent accidental emulation of the Start Code in the coded bit 
   stream, SMPTE 421M defines an encapsulation mechanism that uses byte 
   stuffing.  A BDU which has been encapsulated by this mechanism is 
   referred to as an Encapsulated BDU, or EBDU.  
    
3.3    Decoder initialization parameters 
    
   In the VC-1 Advanced profile, the sequence layer header contains 
   parameters that are necessary to initialize the VC-1 decoder.  These 
   parameters apply to all entry-point segments until the next 
   occurrence of a sequence layer header in the coded bit stream. 
    
   The parameters in the sequence layer header include, among other 
   things, the Advanced profile level, the dimensions of the coded 
   pictures, the aspect ratio, interlace information, the frame rate and 
   up to 31 leaky bucket parameter sets for the Hypothetical Reference 
   Decoder (HRD). 
    
   Section 6.1 of SMPTE 421M [1] provides the formal specification of 
   the sequence layer header. 
    
   Each leaky bucket parameter set for the HRD specifies a peak 
   transmission bit rate and a decoder buffer capacity.  The coded bit 
   stream is restricted by these parameters.  The HRD model does not 
   mandate buffering by the decoder.  Its purpose is to limit the 
   encoder's bit rate fluctuations according to a basic buffering model, 
   so that the resources necessary to decode the bit stream are 
   predictable.  The HRD has a constant-delay mode and a variable-delay 
   mode.  The constant-delay mode is appropriate for broadcast and 
   streaming applications, while the variable-delay mode is designed for 
   video conferencing applications. 
    
   Annex C of SMPTE 421M [1] specifies the usage of the hypothetical 
   reference decoder for VC-1 bit streams.  A general description of the 
   theory of the HRD can be found in [6].

   The concept of an entry-point layer applies only to the VC-1 Advanced 
   profile.  The presence of an entry-point segment header indicates a 
   random access point within the bit stream.  The entry-point segment 
   header specifies current buffer fullness values for the leaky buckets 
   in the HRD.  The header also specifies coding control parameters that 
   are in effect until the occurrence of the next entry-point segment 
   header in the bit stream.  See Section 6.2 of SMPTE 421M [1] for the 
   formal specification of the entry-point segment header. 
    
   Neither a sequence layer header nor an entry-point segment header is 
   defined for the VC-1 Simple and Main profiles.  For these profiles, 
   decoder initialization parameters MUST be conveyed out-of-band from 
   the coded bit stream.  Section 4.4 of this document specifies how the 
   parameters are conveyed by this RTP payload format. 
    
3.4    Ordering of frames 
    
   Frames are transmitted in the same order in which they are captured, 
   except if the presence of B-pictures has been indicated in the 
   decoder initialization parameters.  In the latter case, the frames 
   are reordered by the VC-1 encoder such that the frames that the B-
   pictures depend on are transmitted first.  This is referred to as the 
   coded order of the frames. 
    
   When the presence of B-pictures has been indicated, the decoder is 
   required to buffer one picture.  When an I-picture or a P-picture is 
   received, the picture is not displayed until the next I- or P-picture 
   is received.  However, B-pictures are displayed immediately.  These 
   rules are stated in section 5.4 in SMPTE 421M [1]. 
    
   Figure 1 illustrates the timing relationship between the capture of 
   frames, their coded order, and the display order of the decoded 
   frames.  The figure shows that the display of frame P4 is delayed 
   until frame P5 is received, while frames B2 and B3 are displayed 
   immediately.    
    
    
   Capture:        |I0  P1  B2  B3  P4  ...

4.   Encapsulation of VC-1 format bit streams in RTP 
    
4.1    Access Units 
    
   Each RTP packet contains an integral number of application data units 
   (ADUs).  For VC-1 format bit streams, an ADU is equivalent to one 
   Access Unit (AU), as defined in this section.  Figure 2 shows the 
   layout of an RTP packet with multiple AUs.

   | RTP     | AU(1) | AU(2) |     | AU(n) |

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- .. +-+-+-+-+ 
    
   Figure 2.  RTP packet structure. 
    
   Access Units MUST be byte-aligned.  Each Access Unit MUST start with 
   the AU header defined in section 5.2, and is followed by a variable 
   length payload. 
    
   The AU payload MUST contain data belonging to exactly one VC-1 frame.  
    
   The following rules apply to the contents of each AU payload when the 
   VC-1 Advanced profile is used: 
    
   - The AU payload MUST contain VC-1 bit stream data in EBDU format 
     (i.e., the bit stream must use the byte-stuffing encapsulation 
     mode defined in Annex E of SMPTE 421M [1].) 
    
   - The AU payload MAY contain multiple EBDUs, e.g., a sequence layer 
     header, an entry-point segment header, a frame header and multiple 
     slices and the associated user-data.  (However, all slices and 
     their corresponding macroblocks MUST belong to the same video 
     frame.) 
      
   - The AU payload MUST start at an EBDU boundary, except when the AU 
     payload contains a fragmented frame, in which case the rules in 
     section 4.2 apply.  
    
   If the data in an AU (EBDUs in the case of Advanced profile and frame 
   in the case of Simple and Main) does not end at an octet boundary, up 
   to 7 zero-valued padding bits MUST be added to achieve octet-
   alignment. 
    
4.2    Fragmentation of VC-1 frames 
    
   Each AU payload SHOULD contain a complete VC-1 frame.  However, if 
   this would cause the RTP packet to exceed the MTU size, the frame 
   SHOULD be fragmented into multiple AUs to avoid IP-level 
 
 
Klemets                 Expires - January 2006                [Page 8] 
             RTP Payload Format for Video Codec 1 (VC-1)    July 2005 
 
 
   fragmentation.  When an AU contains a fragmented frame, this MUST be 
   indicated by setting the FRAG field in the AU header as defined in 
   section 5.3. 
    
   AU payloads that do not contain a fragmented frame, or that contain 
   the first fragment of a frame, MUST start at an EBDU boundary if 
   Advanced profile is used.  In this case, for Simple and Main 
   profiles, the AU payload MUST begin with the start of a frame.   
    
   If Advanced profile is used, AU payloads that contain a fragment of a 
   frame other than the first fragment, SHOULD start at an EBDU 
   boundary, such as at the start of a slice. 
    
   However, slices are only defined for the Advanced profile, and are 
   not always used.  Blocks and macroblocks are not BDUs (have no Start 
   Code) and are not byte-aligned.  Therefore, it may not always be 
   possible to continue a fragmented frame at an EBDU boundary. 
    
   If a RTP packet contains an AU with the last fragment of a frame, 
   additional AUs SHOULD NOT be included in the RTP packet.  
    
   If the PTS Delta field in the AU header is used, each fragment of a 
   frame MUST have the same presentation time.  If the DTS Delta field 
   in the AU header is used, each fragment of a frame MUST have the same 
   decode time. 
    
4.3    Time stamp considerations 
    
   Video frames MUST be transmitted in the coded order.  Coded order 
   implies that no frames are dependent on subsequent frames, as 
   discussed in section 3.4.  The RTP timestamp field MUST be set to the 
   decode time of the video frame contained in the first AU in the RTP 
   packet.  The decode time is equivalent to the sampling instant of the 
   frame, except when the codec initialization parameters indicate that 
   the VC-1 bit stream contains B-pictures.  When the presence of B-
   pictures has been indicated, the encoder may reorder frames, as 
   explained in section 3.4 of this document and in section 5.4 of SMPTE 
   421M [1]. 
    
   The VC-1 bit stream does not carry any time stamps other than an 
   optional Temporal Frame Reference Counter field, which, if it is 
   present, can be used to calculate the decode time of a frame.  
   However, the RTP sender may have access to different externally 
   provided time stamps depending on the method used to ingest the VC-1 
   bit stream.  For example, if VC-1 is encapsulated in MPEG-2 Transport 
   Stream, each frame is assigned a presentation time (PTS) and 
   optionally also a decode time (DTS).  If a VC-1 bit stream is stored 
   in an ASF file, only the decode time of each video frame is 
   available.

             RTP Payload Format for Video Codec 1 (VC-1)    July 2005 
 
 
    
   If only presentation time information is available, the RTP sender 
   can approximate the decode time of a frame by its presentation time, 
   after taking frame reordering into account.  Frame reordering can be 
   handled by an algorithm similar to the one illustrated in Figure 1 in 
   section 3.4.  The algorithm requires buffering of only one frame. 
    
   If only decode time information is available, determining the 
   presentation time of a P-frame requires buffering, or looking ahead, 
   to the first frame that does not depend on the P-frame.  Using the 
   coded order sequence in Figure 1 as an example, the RTP sender cannot 
   determine presentation time of frame P4 until it has seen frame P5.  
   This would be a more complicated and costly procedure than to 
   estimate a decode time from the presentation time.  Hence, this RTP 
   payload format defines that the RTP timestamp field must represent 
   the decode time of the frame. 
    
   Knowing if the stream will contain B-pictures helps the decoder 
   allocate resources more efficiently, as the encoder will not reorder 
   any frames.  In that case, the buffering of one frame as described in 
   section 3.4 is not necessary.  Avoiding this buffer reduces the end-
   to-end delay, which may be important for interactive applications.  
   For Advanced profile, B-pictures are assumed to be present by 
   default.  If the coded bit stream never contains B-pictures, this can 
   be indicated using the "bpic" MIME parameter defined in section 6.1.   
    
   For Simple and Main profiles, the presence of B-pictures is indicated 
   by a non-zero value for the MAXBFRAMES field in STRUCT_C decoder 
   initialization parameter.  STRUCT_C conveyed in the MIME "config" 
   parameter, which is defined in section 6.1.   
    
4.4    Signaling of MIME format parameters 
    
   When this RTP payload format is used with SDP, the decoder 
   initialization parameters described in section 3.3 MUST be signaled 
   in SDP using the MIME parameters specified in section 6.1.  Section 
   6.2 specifies how to map the MIME parameters to SDP. 
    
   When the Advanced profile is used, the decoder initialization 
   parameters MAY be changed by inserting a new sequence layer header or 
   an entry-point segment header in the coded bit stream.   
    
   Note that the sequence layer header specifies the encoding level, the 
   maximum size of the coded pictures and possibly also the frame rate.  
   Thus, if the sequence layer header changes, the new header supersedes 
   the values of the MIME parameters "level", "width", "height" and 
   "framerate".

   To improve robustness against loss of RTP packets, it is RECOMMENDED 
   that if the sequence layer header changes, it should be repeated 
   frequently in the bit stream.  Note that any data in the VC-1 bit 
   stream, including the sequence header itself, must be accounted for 
   when computing the leaky bucket parameters for the HRD.  (See section 
   3.3 for a discussion about the HRD.) 
    
   The Seq Count field in the Access Unit header is used to track 
   changes to the sequence layer header.  A value of 0 is reserved for 
   the case when the most recent sequence layer header of the bit stream 
   is identical to the sequence layer header in the MIME "config" 
   parameter (defined in section 6.1.) 
    
   If the RTP sender cannot determine the most recent sequence layer 
   header, or if it is different form the sequence layer header in the 
   MIME "config" parameter, a non-zero value MUST be used for the Seq 
   Count field. 
    
   When the RTP sender transmits an AU containing a sequence layer 
   header that is different from the previous sequence layer header, the 
   value of the Seq Count field MUST be incremented.  The Seq Count 
   field of all subsequent AU headers MUST be set to this new value 
   until the sequence layer header changes again. 
    
   In certain applications, the sequence layer header never changes.  
   This MAY be signaled with the MIME parameter "mode=1" or "mode=3", as 
   appropriate. (See the definition of the "mode" parameter in section 
   6.1.)  If "mode=1" or "mode=3" is signaled and a sequence layer 
   header is present in the coded bit stream, it MUST be identical to 
   the sequence layer header specified by the MIME "config" parameter.  
    
   The entry-point segment header contains information that is needed by 
   the decoder to decode the frames in that segment.  This means that in 
   the event of lost RTP packets the decoder may be unable to decode 
   frames until the next entry-point segment header is received.  Access 
   Units that contain an entry-point segment header MUST have the RA bit 
   in AU header set to 1.  (The RA bit is defined in section 5.3.) 
    
   In certain applications, the entry-point segment header never 
   changes.  This MUST be signaled with the MIME parameter "mode=2" or 
   "mode=3", as appropriate.  In this case, any entry-point segment 
   headers that are present in the bit stream MAY be removed by the RTP 
   sender.  If "mode=2" or "mode=3" is signaled and an entry-point 
   segment header is present in the coded bit stream, it MUST be 
   identical to the entry-point segment header specified by the MIME 
   "config" parameter.

     Figure 3.  RTP header according to RFC 3550 
    
   With the exception of the fields listed below, the RTP header fields 
   are used as defined in RFC 3550 and by the RTP profile in use. 
    
   Marker bit (M): 1 bit 
           This bit is set to 1 if the RTP packet contains an Access 
           Unit containing a complete VC-1 frame, or the last fragment 
           of a VC-1 frame. 
 
   Payload type (PT): 7 bits 
           This document does not assign a RTP payload type for this RTP 
           payload format. The assignment of a payload type has to be 
           performed either through the RTP profile used or in a dynamic 
           way. 
 
   Timestamp: 32 bits 
           The RTP timestamp is set to the decode time of the VC-1 frame 
           in the first Access Unit. 
           A 90 kHz clock rate MUST be used. 
    
5.2    AU header syntax 
    
   The Access Unit header consists of a one-byte AU Control field, and 4 
   optional fields.  The structure of the AU header is illustrated in  
   Figure 4.

   AU Control: 8 bits 
           The usage of the AU Control field is defined in section 5.3. 
    
   Seq Count: 8 bits 
           Sequence Layer Counter.  This field is a binary modulo 256 
           counter.  The value of this field, if present, MUST be 
           incremented by 1, each time an AU containing a new sequence 
           layer header is transmitted.  The value 0 is reserved for the 
           case when the RTP sender knows that the current sequence 
           layer header is identical to the sequence layer header in the 
           MIME "config" parameter (defined in section 6.1) and MUST NOT 
           be used for any other purpose.   
           If this field is not present, a value of 0 MUST be assumed. 
    
   PTS Delta: 32 bits 
           Presentation time delta.  Specifies the presentation time of 
           the frame as a 2's complement offset (delta) from the 
           timestamp in the RTP header of this RTP packet.  The PTS 
           Delta field MUST use the same clock rate as the timestamp 
           field in the RTP header. 
    
   DTS Delta: 32 bits 
           Decode time delta.  Specifies the decode time of the frame as 
           a 2's complement offset (delta) from the timestamp in the RTP 
           header of this RTP packet.  The DTS Delta field MUST use the 
           same clock rate as the timestamp field in the RTP header.   
           This field SHOULD NOT be included in the first AU header in 
           the RTP packet, because the RTP timestamp field specifies the 
           decode time of the frame in the first AU. 
    
   AUP Len: 16 bits 
           Access Unit Payload Length.  Specifies the size, in bytes, of 
           the payload of the Access Unit.  The field does not include 
           the size of the AU header itself.  The field MUST be included 
           in each AU header in an RTP packet, except for the last AU 
           header in the packet. 
    
5.3    AU Control field syntax 
    
   The structure of the 8-bit AU Control field is shown in Figure 5.

   FRAG: 2 bits 
           Fragmentation Information.  This field indicates if the AU 
           payload contains a complete frame or a fragment of a frame.  
           It MUST be set as follows: 
           0: The AU payload contains a fragment of a frame other than 
           the first or last fragment. 
           1: The AU payload contains the first fragment of a frame. 
           2: The AU payload contains the last fragment of a frame. 
           3: The AU payload contains a complete frame (not fragmented.) 
    
   SC: 1 bit 
           Sequence Layer Counter present.  This bit MUST be set to 1 if 
           the AU header includes the Seq Count field.  The bit MUST be 
           0 for Simple and Main profile bit streams. 
    
   RA: 1 bit 
           Random Access Point indicator.  This bit MUST be set to 1 if 
           the AU contains a frame that is a random access point.  In 
           the case of Simple and Main profiles, any I-picture is a 
           random access point.  
           In the case of Advanced profile, the first frame after an 
           entry-point segment header is a random access point.   
           Note that if entry-point segment headers are not transmitted 
           at every random access point, this MUST be indicated using 
           the MIME parameter "mode=2" or "mode=3", as appropriate. 
    
   PT: 1 bit 
           PTS Delta Present.  This bit MUST be set to 1 if the AU 
           header includes the PTS Delta field. 
    
   DT: 1 bit 
           DTS Delta Present.  This bit MUST be set to 1 if the AU 
           header includes the DTS Delta field. 
    
   LP: 1 bit 
           Length Present.  This bit MUST be set to 1 if the AU header 
           includes the AUP Len field. 
    
   R: 1 bit 
           Reserved.  This bit MUST be set to 0 and MUST be ignored by 
           receivers.

6.   RTP Payload format parameters 
 
6.1    Media Type Registration 
 
   The media subtype for VC-1 is allocated from the standards tree.  The 
   top-level media type under which this payload format is registered is 
   'video'. 
    
   The receiver MUST ignore any unrecognized parameter. 
    
   Media type: video 
    
   Media subtype: vc1 
    
   Required parameters: 
    
         profile: 
           The value is a decimal number indicating the VC-1 profile.  
           The following values are defined: 
           0: Simple profile. 
           1: Main profile. 
           3: Advanced profile. 
            
         config:  
           The value is a hexadecimal representation of an octet string 
           that expresses the decoder initialization parameters.  
           Decoder initialization parameters are mapped onto the 
           hexadecimal octet string in an MSB-first basis.  The first 
           bit of the decoder initialization parameters MUST be located 
           at the MSB of the first octet.  If the decoder initialization 
           parameters are not multiple of 8 bits, in the last octet up 
           to 7 zero-valued padding bits MUST be added to achieve octet 
           alignment. 
            
           For the Simple and Main profiles, the decoder initialization 
           parameters are STRUCT_C, as defined in Annex J of SMPTE 421M 
           [1]. 
              
           For the Advanced profile, the decoder initialization 
           parameters are a sequence layer header directly followed by 
           an entry-point segment header.  The two headers MUST be in 
           EBDU format, meaning that they must include their Start Codes 
           and must use the encapsulation method defined in Annex E of 
           SMPTE 421M [1]. 
            
         width: 
           The value is a decimal number specifying the maximum 
           horizontal size of the coded picture in pixels.

           Note: When Advanced profile is used, this parameter only 
           applies while the sequence layer header specified in the 
           config parameter is in use.  
            
         height: 
           The value is a decimal number specifying the maximum vertical 
           size of the coded picture in pixels.   
            
           Note: When Advanced profile is used, this parameter only 
           applies while the sequence layer header specified in the 
           config parameter is in use. 
            
         bitrate: 
           The value is a decimal number specifying the peak 
           transmission rate of the coded bit stream.  The number does 
           not include RTP overhead.   
            
           Note: When Advanced profile is used, this parameter only 
           applies while the sequence layer header specified in the 
           config parameter is in use. 
            
         buffer: 
           The value is a decimal number specifying the leaky bucket 
           size, B, in milliseconds, required to contain a stream 
           transmitted at the transmission rate specified by the bitrate 
           parameter.  This parameter is defined in the hypothetical 
           reference decoder model for VC-1, in Annex C of SMPTE 421M 
           [1]. 
            
           Note: When Advanced profile is used, this parameter only 
           applies while the sequence layer header specified in the 
           config parameter is in use. 
    
   Optional parameters: 
    
         level: 
           The value is a decimal number specifying the level of the 
           encoding profile.   
           For Advanced profile, valid values are 0 to 4, which 
           correspond to levels L0 to L4, respectively.  For Simple and 
           Main profiles, the following values are defined: 
           1: Low Level 
           2: Medium Level 
           3: High Level (only valid for Main profile) 
            
           Note: When Advanced profile is used, this parameter only 
           applies while the sequence layer header specified in the 
           config parameter is in use.

         framerate: 
           The value is a decimal number specifying the number of frames 
           per second, multiplied by 1000.  For example, 29.97 frames 
           per second is represented as 29970. 
            
           Note: When Advanced profile is used, this parameter only 
           applies while the sequence layer header specified in the 
           config parameter is in use. 
            
         bpic: 
           This parameter signals if B-pictures may be present when the 
           Advanced profile is used.  If this parameter is present, and 
           B-pictures may be present in the coded bit stream, this 
           parameter MUST be equal to 1.   
           If B-pictures will never be present in the coded bit stream, 
           even if the sequence layer header changes, this parameter 
           SHOULD be present and its value SHOULD be equal to 0. 
            
           If this parameter is not specified, a value of 1 MUST be 
           assumed. 
            
         mode: 
           The value is a decimal number specifying the use of the 
           sequence layer header and the entry-point segment header.  
           This parameter is only used for Advanced profile.  The 
           following values are defined: 
           0: Both the sequence layer header and the entry-point segment 
           header may change, and changed headers will be included in 
           the RTP packets. 
           1: The sequence layer header specified in the config 
           parameter never changes. 
           2: The entry-point segment header specified in the config 
           parameter never changes.  Entry-point segment headers MAY not 
           be included in the RTP packets.  Each Access Unit that has 
           the RA bit set to 1 contains a random access point even if an 
           entry-point segment header is not included in the RTP packet. 
           3: Modes 1 and 2 combined. 
            
           If the mode parameter is not specified, a value of 0 MUST be 
           assumed.  The mode parameter SHOULD be specified if any of 
           the modes 1-3 apply to the VC-1 bit stream.  
    
   Encoding considerations: 
           This media type is framed and contains binary data.  This 
           media type depends on RTP framing, and hence is only defined 
           for transfer via RTP [3]. 
    
   Security considerations: 
           See Section 7 of this document.

6.2    Mapping of MIME parameters to SDP 
    
   The information carried in the media type specification has a 
   specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) 
   [4].  If SDP is used to specify sessions using this payload format, 
   the mapping is done as follows: 
    
   o The media name in the "m=" line of SDP MUST be video (the media 
     type). 
      
   o The encoding name in the "a=rtpmap" line of SDP MUST be vc1 (the 
     media subtype). 
      
   o The clock rate in the "a=rtpmap" line MUST be 90000. 
    
   o The REQUIRED parameters "profile", "config", "width", "height", 
     "bitrate" and "buffer" MUST be included in the "a=fmtp" line of 
     SDP.

     These parameters are expressed as a MIME media type string, in the 
     form of a semicolon separated list of parameter=value pairs. 
      
   o The OPTIONAL parameters "level", "framerate", "bpic" and "mode", 
     when present, MUST be included in the "a=fmtp" line of SDP. 
     These parameters are expressed as a MIME media type string, in the 
     form of a semicolon separated list of parameter=value pairs: 
      
         a=fmtp:<dynamic payload type> <parameter 
         name>=<value>[,<value>][; <parameter name>=<value>] 
          
   o Any unknown parameters to the device that uses the SDP MUST be 
     ignored.  For example, parameters defined in later specifications 
     MAY be copied into the SDP and MUST be ignored by receivers that 
     do not understand them. 
    
   An example of media representation in SDP is as follows (Simple 
   profile, Medium level): 
    
   m=video 49170 RTP/AVP 98 
   a=rtpmap:98 VC1/90000 
   a=fmtp:98 profile=0;level=2;width=352;height=288;framerate=15000; 
   bitrate=384000;buffer=2000;config=4e291800 
    
7.   Security Considerations 
    
   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification 
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP 
   specification [4], and in any appropriate RTP profile.  This implies 
   that confidentiality of the media streams is achieved by encryption; 
   for example, through the application of SRTP [5].   
    
   A potential denial-of-service threat exists for data encodings using    
   compression techniques that have non-uniform receiver-end 
   computational load.  The attacker can inject pathological RTP packets 
   into the stream that are complex to decode and that cause the 
   receiver to be overloaded.  VC-1 is particularly vulnerable to such 
   attacks, because it is possible for an attacker to generate RTP 
   packets containing frames that affect the decoding process of many 
   future frames.  Therefore, the usage of data origin authentication 
   and data integrity protection of at least the RTP packet is 
   RECOMMENDED; for example, with SRTP [5]. 
    
   Note that the appropriate mechanism to ensure confidentiality and 
   integrity of RTP packets and their payloads is very dependent on the 
   application and on the transport and signaling protocols employed. 
   Thus, although SRTP is given as an example above, other possible 
   choices exist.

8.   IANA Considerations 
    
   IANA is requested to register the media subtype name "vc1" for the 
   media type "video" as specified in section 6.1 of this document.
