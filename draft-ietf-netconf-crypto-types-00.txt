1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG 1.1 [RFC7950] module specifying
   identities and typedefs useful for cryptography.

   As the YANG module only defines identities and typedefs, this draft
   does not present a YANG tree diagram [RFC8340] or any examples
   illustrating usage of the module.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP

   capitals, as shown here.

2.  YANG Module

   This module has normartive references for [RFC4253], [RFC5280],
   [RFC5480], [RFC5652], and [ITU.X690.2015] and has informational
   references to [RFC6234] and [RFC8017]

3.  Security Considerations

   In order to use YANG identities for algorithm identifiers, only the
   most commonly used RSA key lengths are supported for the RSA
   algorithm.  Additional key lengths can be defined in another module
   or added into a future version of this document.

   This document limits the number of elliptical curves supported.  This
   was done to match industry trends and IETF best practice (e.g.,
   matching work being done in TLS 1.3).  If additional algorithms are
   needed, they can be defined by another module or added into a future
   version of this document.

   The YANG module defined in this document specifies only typedefs and
   identities, and hence there are no YANG-specific security
   considerations that need to be addressed.

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  The IETF XML Registry

   This document registers one URI in the "ns" subregistry of the IETF
   XML Registry [RFC3688].  Following the format in [RFC3688], the
   following registration is requested:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-crypto-types
