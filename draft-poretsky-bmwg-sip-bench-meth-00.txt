ABSTRACT
This document describes the methodology for benchmarking Session 
Initiation Protocol (SIP) performance as described in Terminology 
document [Po06].  The methodology and terminology are to be used 
for benchmarking SIP control plane performance with varying control 
and media load.  Both scale and establishment rate are measured by 
control plane performance.  The SIP Devices to be benchmarked may 
be a single device under test (DUT) or a system under test (SUT).  
Benchmarks can be obtained and compared for different types of 
devices such as SIP Proxy Server, SBC, P-CSCF, and Server paired 
with a Firewall/NAT device.

INTERNET-DRAFT           Benchmarking Methodology for     October 2006
                            SIP Networking Devices

1. Introduction

  This document describes the methodology for benchmarking Session 
  Initiation Protocol (SIP) performance as described in Terminology 
  document [Po06].  The methodology and terminology are to be used 
  for benchmarking SIP control plane performance with varying control 
  and media load.  Both scale and establishment rate are measured by 
  control plane performance.  

  The SIP Devices to be benchmarked may be a single device under test 
  (DUT) or a system under test (SUT).  The DUT is a SIP Server, which 
  may be any RFC 3261 [Ro02] conforming device.  The SUT can be any 
  device or group of devices containing RFC 3261 conforming 
  functionality along with Firewall and/or NAT functionality.  This 
  enables benchmarks to be obtained and compared for different types 
  of devices such as SIP Proxy Server, SBC, P-CSCF, Proxy Server 
  paired with a Firewall/NAT device, and P-CSCF paired with a 
  Firewall/NAT device.  SIP Associated Media benchmarks can also 
  be made when testing SUTs.     

  The test cases covered in this methodology document provide
  benchmarks metrics of  Registration Rate, SIP Session Setup Rate, 
  Session Capacity, IM Rate, and Presence Rate.  These can be 
  benchmarked with or without associated Media.  Some cases are also 
  included to cover Forking, Loop detecion, Encrypted SIP, and SIP 
  Flooding.  The test topologies that can be used are described in 
  the Test Setup section.  Topologies are provided for benchmarking 
  of a DUT or SUT.  Benchmarking with Associated Media can be 
  performed when using a SUT.  
  
  SIP permits a wide range of configuration options that are also 
  explained in the Test Setup section.  Benchmark metrics could 
  possibly be impacted by Associated Media. The selected values for 
  Session Duration and Media Streams per Session enable benchmark
  metrics to be benchmarked without Associated Media.  Session Setup 
  Rate could possibly be impacted by the selected value for Maximum 
  Sessions Attempted.  The benchmark for Session Setup Rate is 
  measured with a fixed value for Maximum Sessions Attempted.

2.  Existing definitions
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119.  
   RFC 2119 defines the use of these key words to help make the
   intent of standards track documents as clear as possible.  While this
   document uses these keywords, this document is not a standards track
   document.  The term Throughput is defined in RFC 2544.

   Terms specific to SIP Performance benchmarking are defined in [Po06].

3. Test Setup	

   3.1 Test Topologies	

   Figures 1 through 5 below provide various topologies to perform
   the SIP Performance Benchmarking.  These figures show the Device 
   Under Test (DUT) to be a single server or a System Under Test (SUT).  
   Test Topology options to include benchmarking with Associated Media 
   require use of a SUT and are shown in Figures 4 and 5.

   3.2 Test Considerations
      
   3.2.1 Selection of SIP Transport Protocol
   Test cases may be performed with any transport protocol supported
   by SIP.  This includes, but is not limited to, SIP TCP, SIP UDP, 
   and TLS.  The protocol used for the SIP transport protocol must 
   be reported with benchmarking results. 

   3.2.2 Server
   The Server is a SIP-speaking device that complies with RFC 3261.
   The purpose of this document is to benchmark SIP performance, not
   conformance.  Conformance to RFC 3261 [Ro02] is assumed for all 
   tests.  The Server may be the DU or a component of a SUT that 
   includes Firewall and/or NAT functionality. The components of 
   the SUT may be a single physical device or separate devices.

INTERNET-DRAFT           Benchmarking Methodology for     October 2006
                            SIP Networking Devices

   3.2.3 Associated Media
   Some tests may require associated media to be present for each SIP 
   session.  The Server is not involved in the forwarding of media.
   Associated Media can be benchmarked only with a SUT in which
   the media traverses a Firewall, NAT, or Firewall NAT device.
   The test topologies to be used when benchmarking SUT performance
   for Associated Media are shown in Figures 4 and 5.   

   3.2.4 Selection of Associated Media Protocol
   The test cases specified in this document provide SIP performance 
   independent of the protocol used for the media stream.  Any media 
   protocol supported by SIP may be used.  This includes, but is not
   limited to, RTP, RTSP, and SRTP.  The protocol used for 
   Associated Media must be reported with benchmarking results. 

   3.2.5 Number of Associated Media Streams per SIP Session
   Benchmarking results can possibly vary with the number of media 
   streams per SIP session.  When benchmarking a SUT for voice, a
   single media stream is used.  When benchmarking a SUT for voice 
   and video, two media streams are used.  The number of Associated 
   Media Streams must be reported with benchmarking results.  

   3.2.6 Session Duration
   SUT performance benchmarks can possibly vary with the duration 
   of SIP sessions. Session Duration must be reported with 
   benchmarking results.  A Session Duration of zero seconds 
   indicates transmission of a BYE immediately following successful 
   SIP establishment indicate by receipt of a 200 OK.  An infinite 
   Session Duration indicates that a BYE is never transmitted.
  
   3.2.7 Attempted Sessions per Second
   DUT and SUT performance benchmarks can possibly vary with the 
   the rate of attempted sessions offered by the Tester.  Attempted 
   Sessions per Second must be reported with benchmarking results.

   3.2.8 Stress Testing
   The purpose of this document is to benchmark SIP performance, not
   system stability under stressful conditions such as a high rate
   of Attempted Sessions per Second.

   4.2 Session Setup Rate

      Objective:
      To benchmark the maximum session setup rate performance 
      of the DUT/SUT with zero failures.

      Procedure: 
      1. Configure the DUT in the test topology shown in Figure 1 or
         SUT as shown in Figures 2 or 3.

      2. Configure Tester for SIP UDP with an Attempted Session Rate = 
         100 SPS, Session Duration = 0 sec, Maximum Sessions Attempted 
         = 100,000 and media streams per session=0.

      3. Start Tester to initiate SIP Session establishment with the
         DUT.

      4. Measure Failed Session Attempts and Total Sessions 
         Established at the Tester.

      5. If a Failed Session Attempt is recorded then reduce the
         Attempted Session Rate configured on the Tester by 50%.
   
      6. If no Failed Session Attempt is recorded then increase the 
         Attempted Session Rate configured on the Tester by 50%.

      7. Repeat steps 3 through 6 until the Session Setup 
         Rate is obtained.

   4.3 Session Setup Rate with Loop Detection Enabled

   4.4 Session Setup Rate with Forking

   4.5 Session Setup Rate with Forking and Loop Detection

   4.6 Session Setup Rate with Media

      Objective:
      To benchmark the maximum session setup rate performance 
      of the SUT with zero failures when Associated Media is 
      included in the benchmark test.

      Procedure: 
      1. Configure the SUT in the test topology shown in Figure 4 or 5.

      2. Configure Tester for SIP UDP with an Attempted Session Rate = 
         100 SPS, Session Duration = 30 sec, Maximum Sessions Attempted 
         = 100,000 and media streams per session = 1.  The rate of 
         offered load for each media stream SHOULD be 
         
         (eq 1) Offered Load per Media Stream = 
                Throughput / Maximum Sessions Attempted, 
                    where Throughput is defined in [Ba99].

      3. Start Tester to initiate SIP Session establishment with the
         SUT and transmit media through the SUT to a destination other
         than the server.

      4. At the Tester measure Failed Session Attempts, Total Sessions 
         Established, and Packet Loss [Ba99] of the media.

      5. If a Failed Session Attempt or Packet Loss is recorded then 
         reduce the Attempted Session Rate configured on the Tester by 
         50%.
   
      6. If no Failed Session Attempt or Packet Loss is recorded then 
         increase the Attempted Session Rate configured on the Tester 
         by 50%.

      7. Repeat steps 3 through 6 until the Session Setup Rate is 
         obtained.

      8. Repeat steps 1 through 7 for multimedia in which media streams 
         per session = 2.  

      Expected Results:
      Session Setup Rate results obtained with Associated Media with
      any number of media streams per SIP session will be identical 
      to the Session Setup Rate results obtained without media.

   4.7 Session Capacity

      Objective:
      To benchmark the SIP Control Session Capacity of the DUT/SUT.

      Procedure: 
      1. Configure the DUT in the test topology shown in Figure 1 or
         SUT as shown in Figures 2 or 3.

      2. Configure Tester for SIP UDP with an Attempted Session Rate = 
         100 SPS, Session Duration = 30 sec, Maximum Sessions Attempted 
         = 100,000 and media streams per session = 1.  The rate of 
         offered load for each media stream SHOULD be 
         
         (eq 1) Offered Load per Media Stream = 
                Throughput / Maximum Sessions Attempted, 
                    where Throughput is defined in [Ba99].

      3. Start Tester to initiate SIP Session establishment with the
         SUT and transmit media through the SUT to a destination other
         than the server.

      4. Measure Failed Session Attempts, Total Sessions Established,
         and at the Tester.

      5. If a Failed Session Attempt is recorded then reduce the 
         Maximum Sessions Attempted configured on the Tester by 5,000.
   
      6. If no Failed Session Attempt is recorded then increase the 
         Maximum Sessions Attempted configured on the Tester by 10,000.

      7. Repeat steps 3 through 6 until the Session Capacity is 
         obtained. 

      Expected Results:

   4.8 Session Capacity with Media

     Objective:
      To benchmark the SIP Control Session Capacity of the SUT
      with Associated Media.

     Procedure: 
      1. Configure the DUT in the test topology shown in Figure 1 or
         SUT as shown in Figures 2 or 3.

      2. Configure Tester for SIP UDP with an Attempted Session Rate = 
         Zero-Failure Session Setup Rate, Session Duration = 0 sec, 
         Maximum Sessions Attempted = 10,000 and media streams per 
         session = 0.

      3. Start Tester to initiate SIP Session establishment with the
         DUT.

      4. Measure Failed Session Attempts, Total Sessions Established,
         and Packet Loss [Ba99] at the Tester.

      5. If a Failed Session Attempt or Packet Loss is recorded then 
         reduce the Maximum Sessions Attempted configured on the 
         Tester by 5,000.
   
      6. If no Failed Session Attempt or Packet Loss is recorded then 
         increase the Maximum Sessions Attempted configured on the 
         Tester by 10,000.

      7. Repeat steps 3 through 6 until the Session Capacity is 
         obtained. 

      8. Repeat steps 1 through 7 for multimedia in which media 
         streams per session = 2.  

     Expected Results:
       Session Capacity results obtained with Associated Media with
       any number of media streams per SIP session will be identical 
       to the Session Capacity results obtained without media.

   4.9 Session Setup Rate with TLS Encrypted SIP

   4.10 Session Setup Rate with IPsec Encrypted SIP

   4.11 Session Setup Rate with SIP Flooding

      Objective:
      To benchmark the maximum session setup rate performance 
      of the SUT with zero failures when SIP Flooding is occurring.

      Procedure: 
      1. Configure the DUT in the test topology shown in Figure 1 or 
         the SUT as shown in Figure 2.

      2. Configure Tester for SIP UDP with an Attempted Session Rate = 
         100 SPS, Session Duration = 0 sec, Maximum Sessions Attempted 
         = 100,000, Associated Media Streams per session = 0, and 
         SIP INVITE Message Flood = 500 per second.  

      3. Start Tester to initiate SIP Session establishment with the
         SUT and SIP Flood targetted at the Server.

      4. At the Tester measure Failed Session Attempts, Total Sessions 
         Established, and Packet Loss [Ba99] of the media.

      5. If a Failed Session Attempt or Packet Loss is recorded then 
         reduce the Attempted Session Rate configured on the Tester by 
         50%.
   
      6. If no Failed Session Attempt or Packet Loss is recorded then 
         increase the Attempted Session Rate configured on the Tester 
         by 50%.

      7. Repeat steps 3 through 6 until the Session Setup Rate is 
         obtained.

      8. Repeat steps 1 through 7 with SIP INVITE Message Flood = 
         1000 per second .  

      Expected Results:
      Session Setup Rate results obtained with SIP Flooding may
      be degraded.

5. IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA considerations.

6. Security Considerations

   Documents of this type do not directly affect the security of
   Internet or corporate networks as long as benchmarking is not 
   performed on devices or systems connected to production
   networks.  Security threats and how to counter these in SIP 
   and the media layer is discussed in RFC3261, RFC3550, and 
   RFC3711 and various other drafts.  This document attempts to
   formalize a set of common methodology for benchmarking 
   performance of SIP devices in a lab environment.
