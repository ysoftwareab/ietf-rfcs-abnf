1.  Introduction

   ACME [RFC8555] is a mechanism for automating certificate management
   on the Internet.  It enables administrative entities to prove
   effective control over resources like domain names, and automates the
   process of generating and issuing certificates.

   This document describes an extension to ACME for use by S/MIME.
   Section 3 defines extensions for issuing end-user S/MIME [RFC8550]
   certificates.

   This document aims to support both:

   1.  A Mail User Agent (MUA) which has built-in ACME client which is
       aware of the extension described in this document.  (We will call
       such MUAs "ACME-email-aware".)  Such MUA can present nice User
       Interface to the user and automate certificate issuance.

   2.  A MUA which is not ACME aware, with a separate ACME client
       implemented in a command line tool or as a part of a website.
       While S/MIME certificate issuance is not going to be as painless
       as in the case of the ACME-email-aware MUA, the extra burden on a
       user is going to be minimal.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Use of ACME for issuing end-user S/MIME certificates

   ACME [RFC8555] defines a "dns" Identifier Type that is used to verify
   that a particular entity has control over a domain or specific
   service associated with the domain.  In order to be able to issue
   end-user S/MIME certificates, ACME needs a new Identifier Type that
   proves ownership of an email address.

   This document defines a new Identifier Type "email" which corresponds
   to an email address.  The address can be all ASCII [RFC5321] or
   internationalized [RFC6531]; when an internationalized email address
   is used, the domain part can contain both U-labels and A-labels
   [RFC5890].  This can be used with S/MIME or other similar service
   that requires possession of a certificate tied to an email address.

   Any identifier of type "email" in a newOrder request MUST NOT have a
   wildcard ("*") character in its value.

   A new challenge type "email-reply-00" is used with "email" Identifier
   Type, which provides proof that an ACME client has control over an
   email address.

   The process of issing an S/MIME certificate works as follows.  Note
   that the ACME client can be a standalone application (if the MUA is
   not ACME-email-aware) or can be a component of the MUA.

   1.   An end-user initiates issuance of an S/MIME certificate for one
        of her email addresses.  This might be done using email client
        UI, by running a command line tool, by visiting a Certificate
        Authority web page, etc.  This document doesn't prescribe
        specific UI used to initiate S/MIME certificate issuance or
        where the ACME client is located.

   2.   The ACME-email-aware client component begins the certificate
        issuance process by sending a POST request to the server's
        newOrder resource, including the identifier of type "email".
        See Section 7.4 of [RFC8555] for more details.

   3.   The ACME server responds to the POST request, including an
        "authorizations" URL for the requested email address.  The ACME
        client then retrieves information about the corresponding
        "email-reply-00" challenge as specified in Section 7.5 of

Internet-Draft               ACME for S/MIME               February 2021


        [RFC8555].  The "token" field of the corresponding challenge
        object (from the "challenges" array) contains token-part2.
        token-part2 should contain at least 128 bits of entropy.  The
        "type" field of the challenge object is "email-reply-00".  The
        challenge object also contains the "from" field, with the email
        address that would be used in the From header field of the
        "challenge" email message (see the next step).



   An example Challenge object might look like this:

       {
         "type": "email-reply-00",
         "url": "https://example.com/acme/chall/ABprV_B7yEyA4f",
         "from": "acme-challenge+2i211oi1204310@example.com",
         "token": "DGyRejmCefe7v4NfDGDKfA"
       }

   4.   After responding to the authorization request the ACME server
        generates another token and a "challenge" email message with the
        subject "ACME: <token-part1>", where <token-part1> is the
        base64url encoded [RFC4648] form of the token.  The ACME server
        MUST generate a fresh token for each S/MIME issuance request
        (authorization request), and token-part1 MUST contain at least
        128 bits of entropy.  The "challenge" email message structure is
        described in more details in Section 3.1.

   5.   The MUA retrieves and parses the "challenge" email message.  If
        the MUA is ACME-email-aware, it ignores any "challenge" email
        that is not expected, e.g. if there is no ACME certificate
        issuance pending.  The ACME-email-aware MUA also ignores any
        "challenge" email that has the Subject header field which
        indicates that it is an email reply, e.g. a subject starting
        with the reply prefix "Re:".

   6.   The ACME client concatenates "token-part1" (received over email)
        and "token-part2" (received over HTTPS [RFC2818]) to create the
        ACME "token", calculates keyAuthorization (as per Section 8.1 of
        [RFC8555]), then returns the base64url encoded SHA-256 digest
        [FIPS180-4] of the key authorization.  The MUA returns the
        base64url encoded SHA-256 digest obtained from the ACME client
        in the body of a "response" email message.  The "response" email
        message structure is described in more details in Section 3.2.
        If the MUA is ACME-email-aware, it MUST NOT respond to the same
        "challenge" email more than once.

Internet-Draft               ACME for S/MIME               February 2021


   7.   Once the MUA sends the "response" email, the ACME client
        notifies the ACME server by POST to the challenge URL ("url"
        field).

   8.   The ACME client can start polling the authorization URL (using
        POST-as-GET requests) to see if the ACME server received and
        validated the "response" email message.  (See Section 7.5.1 of
        [RFC8555] for more details.)  If the "status" field of the
        challenge switches to "valid", then the ACME client can proceed
        with request finalization.  The Certificate Signing Request
        (CSR) MUST indicate the exact same set of requested identifiers
        as the initial newOrder request.  For an identifier of type
        "email", the PKCS#10 [RFC2986] CSR MUST contain the requested
        email address in an extensionRequest attribute [RFC2985]
        requesting a subjectAltName extension.  Such email address MUST
        also match the From header field value of the "response" email
        message.

   9.   In order to request generation of signing only or encryption
        only S/MIME certificates (as opposed to requesting generation of
        S/MIME certificates suitable for both), the CSR needs to include
        the key usage extension (see Section 4.4.2 of [RFC8550].  This
        is described in more details in Section 3.3.

   10.  If a request to finalize an order is successful, the ACME server
        will return a 200 (OK) with an updated order object.  If the
        certificate is issued successfully, i.e. if the order "status"
        is "valid", then the ACME client can download the issued S/MIME
        certificate from the URL specified in the "certificate" field.

3.1.  ACME challenge email

   A "challenge" email message MUST have the following structure:

   1.  The message Subject header field has the following syntax: "ACME:
       <token-part1>", where the prefix "ACME:" is followed by folding
       white space (FWS, see [RFC5322]) and then by <token-part1>, which
       is the base64url encoded first part of the ACME token that MUST
       be at least 128 bits long after decoding.  Due to the recommended
       78-octet line length limit in [RFC5322], the subject line can be
       folded, so whitespaces (if any) within the <token-part1> MUST be
       ignored.  [RFC2231] encoding of the message Subject header field
       MUST be supported, and when used, only the "UTF-8" and "US-ASCII"
       charsets are allowed: other charsets MUST NOT be used.  US-ASCII
       charset SHOULD be used.

   2.  The From header field MUST be the same email address as specified
       in the "from" field of the challange object.

Internet-Draft               ACME for S/MIME               February 2021


   3.  The To header field MUST be the email address of the entity that
       requested the S/MIME certificate to be generated.

   4.  The message MAY contain a Reply-To and/or CC header fields.

   5.  The message MUST include the "Auto-Submitted: auto-generated"
       header field [RFC3834].  To aid in debugging (and in for some
       implementations to make automated processing easier) the "Auto-
       Submitted" header field SHOULD include the "type=acme" parameter.
       It MAY include other optional parameters as allowed by the syntax
       of the Auto-Submitted header field.

   6.  In order to prove authenticity of a challenge message, it MUST be
       signed using either DKIM [RFC6376] or S/MIME [RFC8551].

          If DKIM signing is used, the resulting DKIM-Signature header
          field MUST contain the "h=" tag that includes at least "From",
          "Sender", "Reply-To", "To", "CC", "Subject", "Date", "In-
          Reply-To", "References", "Message-ID", "Auto-Submitted",
          "Content-Type", and "Content-Transfer-Encoding" header fields.
          The DKIM-Signature header field's "h=" tag SHOULD also include
          "Resent-Date", "Resent-From", "Resent-To", "Resent-Cc", "List-
          Id", "List-Help", "List-Unsubscribe", "List-Subscribe", "List-
          Post", "List-Owner", "List-Archive" and "List-Unsubscribe-
          Post" header fields.  The domain from the "d=" tag of DKIM-
          Signature header field MUST be the same as the domain from the
          From header field of the "challenge" email.

          If S/MIME signing is used, the certificate corresponding to
          the signer MUST have an rfc822Name subjectAltName extension
          with the value equal to the From header field email address of
          the "challenge" email.

   7.  The body of the challenge message is not used for automated
       processing, so it can be any media type.  (However there are
       extra requirements on S/MIME signing, if used.  See below.)
       Typically it is text/plain or text/html containing a human-
       readable explanation of the purpose of the message.  If S/MIME
       signing is used to prove authenticity of the challenge message,
       then the multipart/signed or "application/pkcs7-mime; smime-
       type=signed-data;" media type should be used.  Either way, it
       MUST use S/MIME header protection.

   An email client compliant with this specification that detects that a
   particular "challenge" email fails validation described above MUST
   ignore the challenge and thus will not generate any "response" email.
   To aid in debugging such failed validations SHOULD be logged.

     This is an automatically generated ACME challenge for email address
     "alexey@example.com". If you haven't requested an S/MIME
     certificate generation for this email address, be very afraid.
     If you did request it, your email client might be able to process
     this request automatically, or you might have to paste the first
     token part into an external program.

3.2.  ACME response email

   A valid "response" email message MUST have the following structure:

   1.  The message Subject header field is formed as a reply to the ACME
       "challenge" email (see Section 3.1).  Its syntax is the same as
       that of the challenge message except that it may be prefixed by a
       US-ASCII reply prefix (typically "Re:") and folding white space
       (FWS, see [RFC5322]), as is normal in reply messages.  When
       parsing the subject, ACME servers MUST decode [RFC2231] encoding
       (if any) and then they can ignore any prefix before the "ACME:"
       label.

   2.  The From: header field contains the email address of the user
       that is requesting S/MIME certificate issuance.

   3.  The To: header field of the response contains the value from the
       Reply-To: header field from the challenge message (if set) or
       from the From: header field of the challenge message otherwise.

   4.  The Cc: header field is ignored if present in the "response"
       email message.

   5.  The In-Reply-To: header field SHOULD be set to the Message-ID
       header field of the challenge message according to rules in
       Section 3.6.4 of [RFC5322].

Internet-Draft               ACME for S/MIME               February 2021


   6.  List-* header fields [RFC4021][RFC8058] MUST be absent (i.e., the
       reply can't come from a mailing list)

   7.  The media type of the "response" email message is either text/
       plain or multipart/alternative [RFC2046] containing text/plain as
       one of the alternatives.  (Note that the requirement to support
       multipart/alternative is to allow use of ACME-unaware MUAs which
       can't always generate pure text/plain, e.g. if they reply to a
       text/html).  The text/plain body part (whether or not it is
       inside multipart/alternative) MUST contain a block of lines
       starting with the line "-----BEGIN ACME RESPONSE-----", followed
       by one or more line containing the base64url-encoded SHA-256
       digest [FIPS180-4] of the key authorization, calculated from
       concatenated token-part1 (received over email) and token-part2
       (received over HTTPS), as outlined in the 5th bullet in
       Section 3.  (Note that each line of text/plain is terminated by
       CRLF.  Bare LFs or bare CRs are not allowed.)  Due to historical
       line length limitations in email, line endings (CRLFs) can be
       freely inserted in the middle of the encoded digest, so they MUST
       be ignored when processing it.)  The final line of the encoded
       digest is followed by a line containing "-----END ACME
       RESPONSE-----".  Any text before and after this block is ignored.
       For example such text might explain what to do with it for ACME-
       unaware clients.

   8.  There is no need to use any Content-Transfer-Encoding other than
       7bit for the text/plain body part.  Use of Quoted-Printable or
       base64 in a "response" email message is not necessary and should
       be avoided, though it is permitted.

   9.  In order to prove authenticity of a response message, it MUST be
       DKIM [RFC6376] signed.  The resulting DKIM-Signature header field
       MUST contain the "h=" tag that includes at least "From",
       "Sender", "Reply-To", "To", "CC", "Subject", "Date", "In-Reply-
       To", "References", "Message-ID", "Content-Type" and "Content-
       Transfer-Encoding" header fields.  The DKIM-Signature header
       field's "h=" tag SHOULD also include "Resent-Date", "Resent-
       From", "Resent-To", "Resent-Cc", "List-Id", "List-Help", "List-
       Unsubscribe", "List-Subscribe", "List-Post", "List-Owner", "List-
       Archive" and "List-Unsubscribe-Post" header fields.  The domain
       from the "d=" tag of DKIM-Signature header field MUST be the same
       as the domain from the From header field of the "response" email.

3.3.  Generating encryption only or signing only S/MIME certificates

   ACME extensions specified in this document can be used to request
   signing only or encryption only S/MIME certificates.

   In order to request signing only S/MIME certificate, the CSR MUST
   include the key usage extension with digitalSignature and/or
   nonRepudiation bits set and no other bits set.

   In order to request encryption only S/MIME certificate, the CSR MUST
   include the key usage extension with keyEncipherment or keyAgreement
   bits set and no other bits set.

   Presence of both of the above sets of key usage bits in the CSR, as
   well as absence of key usage extension in the CSR, signals to ACME
   server to issue an S/MIME certificate suitable for both signing and
   encryption.

4.  Internationalization Considerations

   [RFC8616] updated/clarified use of DKIM with Internationalized Email
   addresses [RFC6531].  Please consult RFC 8616 in regards to any
   changes that need to be implemented.

   Use of non ASCII characters in left hand sides of Internationalized
   Email addresses requires putting Internationalized Email Addresses in
   X.509 Certificates [RFC8398].

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  ACME Identifier Type

   IANA is requested to register a new Identifier type in the "ACME
   Identifier Types" registry defined in Section 9.7.7 of [RFC8555] with
   Label "email" and a Reference to [RFCXXXX], [RFC5321] and [RFC6531].
   The new Identifier Type corresponds to an (all ASCII) email address
   [RFC5321] or Internationalized Email addresses [RFC6531].

5.2.  ACME Challenge Type

   IANA is also requested to register a new entry in the "ACME
   Validation Methods" registry defined in Section 9.7.8 of [RFC8555].
   This entry is as follows:

          +----------------+-----------------+------+-----------+
          |     Label      | Identifier Type | ACME | Reference |
          +----------------+-----------------+------+-----------+
          | email-reply-00 |      email      |  Y   | [RFCXXXX] |
          +----------------+-----------------+------+-----------+

6.  Security Considerations

   Please see Security Considerations of [RFC8555] for general security
   considerations related to use of ACME.  This challenge/response
   protocol demonstrates that an entity that controls the private key
   (corresponding to the public key in the certificate) also controls
   the named email account.  The ACME server is confirming that the
   requested email address belongs to the entity that requested the
   certificate, but this makes no claim to correctness or fitness-for-
   purpose of the address.  It such claims are needed they must be
   obtained by some other mechanism.

   The security of the "email-reply-00" challenge type depends on the
   security of the email system.  A third party that can read and reply
   to user's email messages (by possessing a user's password or a secret
   derived from it that can give read and reply access, such as
   "password equivalent" information; or by being given permissions to
   act on a user's behalf using email delegation feature common in some
   email systems) can request S/MIME certificates using the protocol
   specified in this document and is indistinguishable from the email
   account owner.  This has several possible implications:

   1.  an entity that compromised an email account would be able to
       request S/MIME certificates using the protocol specified in this
       document and such entity couldn't be distinguished from the

       legitimate email account owner (unless some external sources of
       information are consulted);

   2.  for email addresses with legitimate shared access/control by
       multiple users, any such user would be able to request S/MIME
       certificates using the protocol specified in this document and
       such requests can't be attributed to a specific user without
       consulting external systems (such as IMAP/SMTP access logs);

   3.  the protocol specified in this document is not suitable for use
       with email addresses associated with mailing lists [RFC5321].
       While it is not always possible to guarantee that a particular
       S/MIME certificate request is not from a mailing list address,
       prohibition on inclusion of List-* header fields helps
       Certificate Issuers to handle most common cases.

   An email system in its turn depends on DNS.  A third party that can
   manipulate DNS MX records for a domain might be able to redirect
   email and can get (at least temporary) read and reply access to it.
   Similar considerations apply to DKIM TXT records in DNS.  Use of
   DNSSEC by email system administrators is recommended to avoid making
   it easy to spoof DNS records affecting email system.  However use of
   DNSSEC is not ubiquitous at the time of publishing of this document,
   so it is not required here.  Also, many existing systems that rely on
   verification of ownership of an email address, for example 2 factor
   authentication systems used by banks or traditional certificate
   issuance systems send email messages to email addresses, expecting
   the owner to click on the link supplied in them (or to reply to a
   message), without requiring use of DNSSEC.  So the risk of not
   requiring DNSSEC is presumed acceptable in this document.

   An ACME email challenge message can be forged by an attacker.  As per
   requirements on an ACME-email-aware MUA specified in Section 3, the
   MUA will not respond to requests it is not expecting.  Even if the
   attacker causes the erroneous "response" email to go to an attacker-
   controlled email address, very little information is leaked -- the
   SHA-256 hash of the key authorization, not the key authorization
   itself, so no parts of the token or the the account key thumbprint
   are leaked.

   An attacker that can read the "response" email has only one chance to
   guess the token-part2.  Even if the attacker can guess it right, it
   still needs to know the ACME account key to be able to make use of
   the intercepted SHA-256 hash of the key authorization.

   Also see Security Considerations section of [RFC6376] for details on
   how DKIM depends on the DNS and the respective vulnerabilities this
   dependence has.
