1.  Introduction

   The Alternate Marking [RFC8321] and Multipoint Alternate Marking
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-multipoint-alt-mark] define the Alternate Marking
   technique that is an hybrid performance measurement method, per
   [RFC7799] classification of measurement methods.  This method is
   based on marking consecutive batches of packets and it can be used to
   measure packet loss, latency, and jitter on live traffic.

   AltMark Option [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-alt-mark] applies the Alternate
   Marking Method for IPv6 protocol, and defines Extension Header Option
   to encode Alternate Marking Method for both Hop-by-Hop Options Header
   and Destination Options Header.

   While the AltMark Option implement the basic alternate marking
   method, this document defines the extended data fields for the
   AltMark Option and provides the enhanced capabilities.

   It is worth mentioning that the enhanced capabilities are intended
   for further use and are optional.

2.  Data Fields Format

   The following figure shows the data fields format for enhanced
   alternate marking.  This data is expected to be encapsulated to
   specific transports.

   where:

   o  FlowMonID - Flow Monitoring Identification is the same as defined
      in AltMark Option [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-alt-mark].

   o  L and D - Loss Flag and Delay Flag are the same as defined in
      AltMark Option [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-alt-mark].

   o  NextHeader - Identify whether to carry the extended data fields.

   o  FlowMonID Ext - 20 bits unsigned integer.  This used to extend the
      FlowMonID to reduce the conflict when random allocation is applied

   o  R - Reserved for further use.  This bit MUST be set to zero.

   o  F - Flow direction identification.  F = 1, indicate the flow
      direction is forward.

   o  Len - Length.  It indicates the length of extension headers.

   o  MetaInfo - A 16 bits Bitmap to indicate more meta data attached
      for the enhanced function.

3.  Enhanced Alternate Marking capabilities

   The extended data fields presented in the previous section can be
   used for several uses.  Some possible applications can be:

   1.  shortest marking periods of single marking method for thicker
       packet loss measurements.

   2.  more dense delay measurements than double marking method (down to
       each packet).

   3.  increase the entropy of flow monitoring identifier by extending
       the size of FlowMonID.
