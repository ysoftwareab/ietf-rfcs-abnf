1.  Introduction

   Transport networks are evolving from current DWDM systems towards
   elastic optical networks, based on flexi-grid transmission and
   switching technologies [RFC7698].  Such technology aims at increasing
   both transport network scalability and flexibility, allowing the
   optimization of bandwidth usage.

   While [I-D.ietf-ccamp-flexigrid-yang] focuses on flexi-grid objects
   such as nodes, transponders and links, this document presents a YANG
   [RFC7950] model for the flexi-grid media-channel.  This YANG module
   defines the whole path from a source transponder or node to the
   destination through a number of intermediate nodes in the flexi-grid
   network.

Internet-Draft               Flexi-Grid YANG                   July 2021


   This document identifies the flexi-grid media-channel components,
   parameters and their values, characterizes the features and the
   performances of the flexi-grid elements.  An application example is
   provided towards the end of the document to better understand their
   utility.

2.  Terminology

   Refer to [RFC7446] and [RFC7699] for the key terms used in this
   document.

   The following terms are defined in [RFC7950] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  client

   o  server

   o  augment

   o  data model

   o  data node

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6241] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  configuration data

   o  state data

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC7950].

3.  Flexi-Grid Media-Channel Overview

   The present model defines a flexi-grid media-channel mainly composed
   of:

   o  source address

   o  source flexi-grid port

   o  source flexi-grid transponder

   o  destination address

   o  destination flexi-grid port

Internet-Draft               Flexi-Grid YANG                   July 2021


   o  destination flexi-grid transponder

   o  list of links that defines the path

   o  other optical attributes

   Each path can be a media-channel (only defined by source and
   destination node) or a network media-channel (additionally needs
   source and destination transponders).  Therefore, all the attributes
   are optional to support both situations.

   This is achieved by a combination of the traffic engineering tunnel
   attributes explained in [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te] and augments when
   necessary.  For instance, source address, source flexi-grid
   transponder, destination address and destination flexi-grid
   transponder attributes are directly taken from tunnel, whereas other
   attributes such as source flexi-grid port, destination flexi-grid
   port are defined, as they are specific for flexi-grid.

4.  Example of Use

   In order to explain how this model is used, we provide the following
   example.  An optical network usually has multiple transponders,
   switches (nodes) and links.  Figure 1 shows a simple topology, where
   two physical paths interconnect two optical transponders.

                        Figure 1: Topology Example

   In order to configure a network media channel to interconnect
   transponders A and E, first of all we have to populate the flexi-grid
   topology YANG model with all elements in the network:

   o  We define the transponders within nodes A and E as tunnel
      termination points (TTPs) and provide their internal local link
      connectivity towards the node interfaces.  We also provide nodes A
      and B identifiers, addresses and interfaces.

   o  We do the same for the nodes B, C and D, providing their
      identifiers, addresses and interfaces, as well as the internal
      connectivity matrix between interfaces.

   o  Then, we also define the links 1 to 5 that interconnect nodes,
      indicating which flexi-grid labels are available.

   o  Other information, such as the slot frequency and granularity are
      also provided.

Internet-Draft               Flexi-Grid YANG                   July 2021


   After the nodes, links and transponders have been defined using
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-flexigrid-yang] we can configure the media-channel
   from the information we have stored in the flexi-grid topology, by
   querying which elements are available, and planning the resources
   that have to be provided on each situation.  Note that every element
   in the flexi-grid topology has a reference, and this is the way in
   which they are called in the media-channel.

   o  Depending on the case, it is possible to define either the source
      and destination node ports, or the source and destination node and
      transponder.  In our case, we would define a network media
      channel, with source transponder A and source node B, and
      destination transponder E and destination node C.  Thus, we are
      going to follow path x.

   o  Then, for each link in the path x, we indicate which channel we
      are going to use, providing information about the slots, and what
      nodes are connected.

   o  Finally, the flexi-grid topology has to be updated with each
      element usage status each time a media channel is created or torn
      down.

6.  Security Considerations

   The configuration, state, and action data defined in this document
   are designed to be accessed via a management protocol with a secure
   transport layer, such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].
   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF users to a preconfigured
   subset of all available NETCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  /te:te/te:tunnels/te:tunnel

   o  /te:te/.../te:te-bandwidth/te:technology

   o  /te:te/.../te:type/te:label/te:label-hop/te:te-label/te:technology

   o  /te:te/.../te:label-restrictions/te:label-restriction/te:label-
      start/te:te-label/te:technology

   o  /te:te/.../te:label-restrictions/te:label-restriction/te:label-
      end/te:te-label/te:technology

   o  /te:te/.../te:label-restrictions/te:label-restriction/

   Editors note: we are using simplified description by folding similar
   branches to avoid repetition.

7.  IANA Considerations

   To be discussed.
