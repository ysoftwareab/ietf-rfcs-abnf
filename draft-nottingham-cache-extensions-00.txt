Abstract

   HTTP/1.1 provides for extensions to Cache-Control headers, which
   provide new methods of controlling caches. This document specifies
   extensions which allow content providers more precise control over
   shared caches.

1. Introduction

   Shared caches are sometimes deployed into the Internet with the
   participation of the providers of content which will be flowing
   through them. For example, a content provider may use a surrogate
   HTTP server to improve performance. Likewise, an access provider who
   controls both the origin servers and caching proxies in their
   network may wish to optimize the relationship between them.

   Although HTTP/1.1 provides mechanisms for controlling caches, it
   does not provide an efficient means of controlling objects already
   in cache. In the situations outlined above, it would be useful to
   allow content providers to manipulate cached objects.

   This document provides simple mechanisms to do so, by use of
   Cache-Control request header extensions.

   It should be noted that because of their nature, the extensions lose
   efficiency when used with a large number of shared caches.

1.1 Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119[2].

   An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or
   more of the MUST or REQUIRED level requirements. An implementation
   that satisfies all the MUST or REQUIRED level and all the SHOULD
   level requirements is said to be "unconditionally compliant"; one
   that satisfies all the MUST level requirements but not all the
   SHOULD level requirements is said to be "conditionally compliant".

2. Direct Cache Manipulation Extensions

   This section specifies Cache-Control request header extensions which
   allow specification of cache operations, as allowed for in
   HTTP/1.1[1].

   These extensions are intended for the manipulation of shared caches;
   they MUST NOT be interpreted by non-shared caches.

   Upon receiving one of these extension headers, an implementation
   will perform the operation specified, and then MUST return a
   response; the type of response returned is dependent on the nature
   of the operation.

   Such responses MUST NOT have an entity body included. If the status
   code returned would normally have a body, a 'Content-Length: 0'

   header MUST be included.

2.1 Prefetch

   The prefetch extension allows content providers to insert an object
   into the cache without incurring the expense of a complete round
   trip for the object body.

   prefetch-extension = "prefetch"

   For example, if the resource "http://www.example.com/largeobject"
   were requested from a DCM-capable shared cache, with a
   "Cache-Control: prefetch" header, the intermediate would operate
   exactly as it normally does, except that the response would not
   contain an entity body. 

   This avoids the inefficiency of transporting the object both to the
   cache and then to the device which made the request, which is
   frequently near the origin server. 

   Implementations SHOULD support validation, server-driven content
   negotiation and other HTTP mechanisms in conjunction with this
   mechanism.

   The prefetch extension MUST NOT be forwarded by implementations.

2.2 Eject

   This extension enables the eviction of objects from the cache. When
   an implementation receives this directive, it MUST evict the object
   identified by the resource, so that the next request for the
   resource is unconditional (unless the request itself is conditional).

   eject-extension = "eject"

   When ejecting objects, implementations MUST eject all variants of
   the resource identified.

   Requests containing the eject extension MUST NOT be forwarded by
   implementations.

3. Security Considerations

   This document does not address security-related issues, but the
   mechanisms it describes should be used in conjuction with
   appropriate authentication and authorization control. Such control
   may be implementation-specific, although there are defined
   mechanisms in the HTTP and elsewhere that may be appropriate.

   In particular, unauthorized use of these mechanisms may lead to
   reduced cache efficiency, denial of service to the intermediate, and
   may make other security issues in the intermediate more readily
   exploitable.
