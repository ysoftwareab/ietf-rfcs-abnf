       Abstract

       The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) scheme, "cid", allows
       compound or aggregate objects in a multipart mail message to
       refer to one another by their body part labels.

       1. Introduction

       There is a desire to refer to email or netnews messages and
       the body parts of such messages using Uniform Resource
       Locators (URLs).  The MID and CID schemes described below
       permit such references.

       The use of [MIME] within email to convey Web pages and their
       associated images requires a URL scheme to permit the HTML
       to refer to the images included in the message.  A Content-
       ID Uniform Resource Locator serves that purpose.  Similarly
       NetNews readers use Message-IDs to link related messages
       together.  The Message-ID URL provides a scheme for that
       purpose.

       2. The MID and CID URL Schemes

       RFC1738 [URL] reserves the scheme "cid" for Content-ID.
       This memorandum defines the syntax for the cid URL.  Because
       a Message-ID scheme uses the same syntatic elements both are
       presented together.


       The URLs takes the form

               cidurl     = "cid" ":" id-spec

               midurl     = msgmid / cidmid

               msgmid     = "mid" ":" id-spec

               cidmid     = msgmid "#" cidurl

               id-spec    = local-part "@" hostname
                                           ; globally unique

               local-part = 1*uchar

       where id-spec is a restricted form of "addr-spec" as defined
       in [RFC822] and hostname and uchar are defined in [RFC1738,
       sec 3.1].  The purpose of the restriction on addr-spec is to
       eliminate special characters from the cid URL.  Such
       characters can be problematical in many environments (e.g.,
       HTML and SGML) in which the cidurl may be used.  Special
       characters are representable, however, by using the escape
       mechanism provided in [RFC1738] Cidurls and midurls are a
       subset of MIME content-IDs and RFC822 message-IDs
       respectively.

       A msgmid refers to the entire message and the cidmid refers
       to a single body part within the referenced message.

       The cidurls and midurls differ from message-ids and MIME
       content-ids in the inclusion of the scheme part and in the
       omission of the leading and trailing brackets, "<" and ">",
       and the restricted character set.  To transform a cidurl or
       midurl into a valid content-id or message-id, surround the
       id-spec part with the enclosing brackets, i.e.,

               content-id = "<" id-spec ">".

               message-id = "<" id-spec ">".

       Cidurls and midurls are globally unique [MIME, p.19].  A
       common technique for generating a globally unique cidurl and
       midurl uses a time and date stamp with the local host's
       domain name, e.g., 950124.162336@XIson.com.

       3. Security

       Security issues are not addressed in this memorandum.
