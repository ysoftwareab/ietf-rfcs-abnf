Abstract

   This memo describes an RTP Payload format for the scalable extension
   of the ITU-T Recommendation H.264 video codec which is the
   technically identical to ISO/IEC International Standard 14496-10
   video codec.  The RTP payload format allows for packetization of one
   or more Network Abstraction Layer Units (NALUs), produced by the
   video encoder, in each RTP payload.  The payload format has wide
   applicability, as it supports applications from simple low bit-rate
   conversational usage, to Internet video streaming with interleaved
   transmission, to high bit-rate video-on-demand.

INTERNET-DRAFT    Scalable Video Codec RTP Payload Format  October 2005


1. Introduction

1.1. SVC - the scalable enhancement of H.264/AVC

   This memo specifies an RTP [RFC3550] payload format for a
   forthcoming new mode of the H.264/AVC video codec, known as Scalable
   Video Coding (SVC). Formally, SVC will take the form of an Amendment
   to ISO/IEC 14496 Part 10 [MPEG4-10], and likely as one or more new
   Annexes of ITU-T Rec. H.264 [H.264].  It is planned to keep the
   technical alignment between the two mentioned specifications, as
   well as backward compatibility with previous versions of H.264/AVC.

   The current working draft of SVC is available for public review
   [SVC]. Technical maturity will be reached perhaps around mid 2006
   for which timeframe the ISO/IEC Committee Draft is expected.  In
   this memo, SVC is used as an acronym for the mentioned scalable
   extensions of H.264/AVC.

   SVC covers all of H.264/AVC's applications, ranging from all forms
   of digital compressed video from, low bit-rate Internet streaming
   applications to HDTV broadcast and Digital Cinema applications with
   nearly lossless coding.

   This memo tries to follow a similar philosophy by keeping as close
   an alignment to the H.264/AVC payload RFC [RFC3984] as possible.  It
   basically documents the enhancements relevant from an RTP transport
   viewpoint, defines signaling support for SVC, and deprecates the
   single NAL unit mode of RFC 3984.

2. Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

   This specification uses the notion of setting and clearing a bit
   when bit fields are handled.  Setting a bit is the same as assigning
   that bit the value of 1 (On).  Clearing a bit is the same as
   assigning that bit the value of 0 (Off).

3. The SVC Codec

3.1. Overview

   SVC provides scalable video bitstreams.  A scalable video bitstream
   contains a non-scalable base layer and one or more enhancement
   layers.  An enhancement layer may enhance the temporal resolution
   (i.e. the frame rate), the spatial resolution, or the quality of the
   video content represented by the lower layer or part thereof.  The
   scalable layers can be aggregated to a single RTP stream, or
   transported independently.

INTERNET-DRAFT    Scalable Video Codec RTP Payload Format  October 2005

   The concept of video coding layer (VCL) and network abstraction
   layer (NAL) is inherited from AVC. The VCL contains the signal
   processing functionality of the codec; mechanisms such as transform,
   quantization, motion-compensated prediction, loop filter, inter-
   layer prediction.  A coded picture of a base or enhancement layer
   consists of one or more slices.  The Network Abstraction Layer (NAL)
   encapsulates each slice generated by the VCL into one or more
   Network Abstraction Layer Units (NAL units). Please consult RFC 3984
   for a more in-depth discussion of the NAL unit concept.

   Each SVC layer is formed by NAL units, representing the coded video
   bits of the layer.  An RTP stream carrying only one layer would
   carry NAL units belonging to that layer only.  An RTP stream
   carrying a complete scalable video bit stream would carry NAL units
   of a base layer and one or more enhancement layers.  SVC specifies
   the decoding order of these NAL units.

   The concept of scaling the visual content quality by omitting the
   transport and decoding of entire enhancement layers is denoted as
   coarse-grained scalability (CGS).

   In some cases, the bit rate of a given enhancement layer can be
   reduced by truncating bits from individual NAL units.  Truncation
   leads to a graceful degradation of the video quality of the
   reproduced enhancement layer.  This concept is known as fine-grained
   (granularity) scalability (FGS).


3.2. Parameter Set Concept

   The parameter set concept is inherited from AVC. In SVC, pictures
   from different layers may use the same sequence or picture parameter
   set and may also use different sequence or picture parameter sets.
   If different sequence parameter sets are used, then at any time
   instant during the decoding process, there may be more than one
   active sequence picture parameter set. Any specific active sequence
   parameter set remains unchanged throughout a coded video sequence,
   and any active picture parameter set remains unchanged within a
   coded picture.

3.3. Network Abstraction Layer Unit Header

   An SVC NAL unit consists of a header of one, two or three bytes and
   the payload byte string.  The header indicates the type of the NAL
   unit, the (potential) presence of bit errors or syntax violations in
   the NAL unit payload, information regarding the relative importance
   of the NAL unit for the decoding process, and (optionally, when the
   header is of three bytes) the scalable layer decoding dependency
   information. This RTP payload specification is designed to be
   unaware of the bit string in the NAL unit payload.

   The NAL unit header co-serves as the payload header of this RTP
   payload format.  The payload of a NAL unit follows immediately.

INTERNET-DRAFT    Scalable Video Codec RTP Payload Format  October 2005

   The syntax and semantics of the NAL unit header are specified in
   [SVC], but the essential properties of the NAL unit header are
   summarized below.

   The first byte of the NAL unit header has the following format (it's
   the same as in H.264/AVC and RFC 3984):

         +---------------+
         |0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |F|NRI|  Type   |
         +---------------+

   F: 1 bit
   forbidden_zero_bit.  The H.264 specification declares a value of 1
   as a syntax violation.

   NRI: 2 bits
   nal_ref_idc.  A value of 00 indicates that the content of the NAL
   unit is not used to reconstruct reference pictures for inter picture
   prediction.  Such NAL units can be discarded without risking the
   integrity of the reference pictures in the same layer.  Values
   greater than 00 indicate that the decoding of the NAL unit is
   required to maintain the integrity of the reference pictures. For a
   slice or slice data partitioning NAL unit, a NRI value of 11
   indicates that the NAL unit contains data of a key picture, as
   specified in [SVC].

   Informative Note: The concept of a key picture has been introduced
   in SVC, and no assumption should be made that any pictures in bit
   streams compliant with the 2003 and 2005 versions of H.264 follow
   this rule.

   Type: 5 bits
   nal_unit_type.  This component specifies the NAL unit payload type
   as defined in table 7-1 of [SVC], and later within this memo.  For a
   reference of all currently defined NAL unit types and their
   semantics, please refer to section 7.4.1 in [SVC].

   Previously, NAL unit types 20 and 21 (among others) have been
   reserved for future extensions.  SVC is using these two NAL unit
   types.  They indicate the presence of one more byte that is helpful
   from a transport viewpoint.

         +---------------+
         |0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |   PRID    |D|E|
         +---------------+

   PRID: 6 bits
   simple_priority_id.  This component specifies a priority identifier
   for the NAL unit. When extension_flag is equal to 0,
   simple_priority_id is used for inferring the values of
   dependency_id, temporal_level, and quality_level. When

Wenger, Wang               Standards Track                    [page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT    Scalable Video Codec RTP Payload Format  October 2005

   simple_priority_id is not present, it shall be inferred to be equal
   to 0.

   D: 1 bit
   discardable_flag.  A value of 1 indicates that the content of the
   NAL unit (dependency_id = currDependencyId) is not used in the
   decoding process of NAL units with dependency_id > currDependencyId.
   Such NAL units can be discarded without risking the integrity of
   higher scalable layers with larger values of dependency_id.
   discardable_flag equal to 0 indicates that the decoding of the NAL
   unit is required to maintain the integrity of higher scalable layers
   with larger values of dependency_id.

   E: 1 bit
   extension_flag.  A value of 1 indicates that the third byte of the
   NAL unit header is present.

   When the E-bit of the second byte is 1, then the NAL unit header
   extends to a third byte:

         +---------------+
         |0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         | TL  | DID | QL|
         +---------------+

   TL: 3 bits
   temporal_level.  This component is used to indicate temporal
   scalability or frame rate. A layer consisted of pictures of a
   smaller temporal_level value has a smaller frame rate.

   DID: 3 bits
   dependency_id.  This component is used to indicate the inter-layer
   coding dependency hierarchy. At any temporal location, a picture of
   a smaller dependency_id value may be used for inter-layer prediction
   for coding of a picture with a larger dependency_id value.

   QL: 2 bits
   quality_level.  This component is used to indicate FGS layer
   hierarchy. At any temporal location and with identical dependency_id
   value, an FGS picture with quality_level value equal to QL uses the
   FGS picture or base quality picture (the non-FGS picture when QL-1 =
   0) with quality_level value equal to QL-1 for inter-layer
   prediction. When QL is larger than 0, the NAL unit contains an FGS
   slice or part thereof.

   This memo introduces new NAL unit types, which are presented in
   section 5.2.  The NAL unit types defined in this memo are marked as
   unspecified in [SVC].  Moreover, this specification extends the
   semantics of F, NRI, PRID, D, TL, DID and QL as described in section
   5.3.

   This payload specification can only be used to carry the "naked" SVC
   NAL unit stream over RTP, and not the bitstream format discussed in
   Annex B of SVC.  Likely, the applications of this specification will
   be in the IP based multimedia communications fields including
   conversational multimedia, video telephony or video conferencing,
   Internet streaming and TV over IP.

5. Definitions and Abbreviations

5.1. Definitions

   This document uses the definitions of [SVC] and [H.264].  The
   following terms, defined in [SVC], are summed up for convenience:

   scalable bitstream: an SVC compliant bit stream containing a base
   layer and at least one enhancement layer

   access unit: A set of NAL units pertaining to a certain temporal
   location. An access unit includes the slice data of the pictures of
   all scalable layers at that temporal location and possibly other
   associated data e.g. SEI messages and parameter sets.

   coded video sequence: A sequence of access units that consists, in
   decoding order, of an instantaneous decoding refresh (IDR) access
   unit followed by zero or more non-IDR access units including all
   subsequent access units up to but not including any subsequent IDR
   access unit.

   IDR access unit: An access unit in which all the primary coded
   pictures are IDR pictures.

   IDR picture: A coded picture with the property that the decoding of
   this coded picture and all the following coded pictures in decoding
   order, in the same layer (i.e. with the same values of dependency_id
   and quality_level, respectively), can be performed without inter
   prediction from any picture prior to the coded picture in decoding
   order in the same layer. An IDR picture causes a "reset" in the
   decoding process of the scalable layer containing the IDR picture.


5.2. Abbreviations

   In addition to the abbreviations defined in [RFC3984], the following
   ones are defined.

   CGS:       Coarse granularity scalability
   FGS:       Fine granularity scalability
   MANE:      Media-aware network element

6.1. RTP Header Usage

   Please see section 5.1 of RFC3984 [RFC3984].

INTERNET-DRAFT    Scalable Video Codec RTP Payload Format  October 2005

6.2. Common Structure of the RTP Payload Format

   Please see section 5.2 of RFC3984 [RFC3984].

6.3. NAL Unit Header Usage

   The structure and semantics of the NAL unit header were introduced
   in section 3.3.  This section specifies the semantics of F, NRI,
   PRID, D, TL, DID and QL according to this specification.

   The semantics of F specified in section 5.3 of [RFC3984] also
   applies herein.

   For NRI, for the bitstream that is compliant with AVC, the semantics
   specified in section 5.3 of [H.264] are applicable, otherwise only
   the semantics specified in SVC [SVC] is applicable.

   For PRID, in addition to the semantics specified in [SVC], according
   to this RTP payload specification, values of PRID indicate the
   relative transport priority, as determined by the encoder, which is
   typically increasing from a lower layer to a higher layer.  MANEs
   can use this information to protect more important NAL units better
   than they do less important NAL units.  The transport priority
   increases as the PRID value increases.

   For D, MANEs can use this information to protect NAL units with D
   equal to 0 better than they do NAL units with D equal to 1.

   For TL, DID and QL, in addition to the semantics specified in [SVC],
   according to this RTP payload specification, values of TL, DID or QL
   indicate the relative transport priority.  MANEs can use this
   information to protect more important NAL units better than they do
   less important NAL units.  A higher value of TL, DID or QL indicates
   a higher priority if the other two components are identical
   correspondingly.

      Informative note: Using of SPID, D, TL, DID and QL in combination
      may better indicate the relative transport priority.

6.4. Packetization Modes

   Please see section 5.4 of RFC3984 [RFC3984].  The single NAL unit
   mode SHALL NOT be used.

6.5. Decoding Order Number (DON)

   Please see section 5.5 of RFC3984 [RFC3984].

6.6. Single NAL Unit Packet

   Please see section 5.6 of RFC3984 [RFC3984].

6.7. Aggregation Packets

   Please see section 5.7 of RFC3984 [RFC3984].

   according to the changes listed below, a little later in the
   process.  For now, we just list the adjustments necessary, so not to
   bury any new information in the RFC 3984 text.

12.  Security Considerations

   Please see section 11 of RFC3984 [RFC3984].

13.  Congestion Control

   Within any given RTP session carrying payload according to this
   specification, the provisions of section 12 of RFC3984 [RFC3984]
   apply.

   On key motivation for the introduction of a scalable codec has been
   the problem of network congestion as a whole.  While scalability
   cannot reduce congestion for the transport path of a given RTP
   session, MANEs and layered multicast technologies can be used to
   alleviate network-wide congestion.

   MANEs MAY alleviate congestion on their outgoing network path by
   a) removing the NAL units belonging to hierarchically "highest"
      enhancement layer (or set of enhancement layers) from an RTP
      stream carrying base and enhancement layers.
   b) removing some or all bits of a given FGS NAL unit.

   In both cases, the incoming RTP session is terminated in the MANE,
   and a second RTP session originates at the MANE.  The MANE acts as
   an RTP translator.  The concept of scalability keeps the
   implementation and computational effort within the MANE low, and
   avoids expensive and delay-intensive full transcoding (in the sense
   of reconstruction and re-encoding).

   When scalable layers are transported in their own RTP sessions, an
   RTP receiver SHOULD unsubscribe to one or more enhancement layers
   when it senses congestion, similar to what has been described in
   [McCanne/Vetterli].  This behavior could perhaps be sufficient to
   ease the network load to an acceptable level of congestion.
   Nevertheless, it MUST follow the mechanisms described in section 12
   of [RFC3984].
