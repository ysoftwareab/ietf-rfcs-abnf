     Handling Long Lines in Inclusions in Internet-Drafts and RFCs
                  draft-ietf-netmod-artwork-folding-06

Abstract

   This document defines two strategies for handling long lines in
   width-bounded text content.  One strategy is based on the historic
   use of a single backslash ('\') character to indicate where line-
   folding has occurred, with the continuation occurring with the first
   non-space (' ') character on the next line.  The second strategy
   extends the first strategy by adding a second backslash character to
   identify where the continuation begins and thereby able to handle
   cases not supported by the first strategy.  Both strategies use a
   self-describing header enabling automated reconstitution of the
   original content.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7994] sets out the requirements for plain-text RFCs and states
   that each line of an RFC (and hence of an Internet-Draft) must be
   limited to 72 characters followed by the character sequence that
   denotes an end-of-line (EOL).

   Internet-Drafts and RFCs often include example text or code
   fragments.  Many times the example text or code exceeds the 72
   character line-length limit.  The `xml2rfc` utility does not attempt
   to wrap the content of such inclusions, simply issuing a warning
   whenever lines exceed 69 characters.  According to the RFC Editor,
   there is currently no convention in place for how to handle long
   lines in such inclusions, other than advising authors to clearly
   indicate what manipulation has occurred.

   This document defines two strategies for handling long lines in
   width-bounded text content.  One strategy is based on the historic
   use of a single backslash ('\') character to indicate where line-
   folding has occurred, with the continuation occurring with the first
   non-space (' ') character on the next line.  The second strategy
   extends the first strategy by adding a second backslash character to
   identify where the continuation begins and thereby able to handle
   cases not supported by the first strategy.  Both strategies use a
   self-describing header enabling automated reconstitution of the
   original content.

   The strategies defined in this document work on any text content, but
   are primarily intended for a structured sequence of lines, such as
   would be referenced by the <sourcecode> element defined in
   Section 2.48 of [RFC7991], rather than for two-dimensional imagery,
   such as would be referenced by the <artwork> element defined in
   Section 2.5 of [RFC7991].

   Note that text files are represented as lines having their first
   character in column 1, and a line length of N where the last
   character is in the Nth column and is immediately followed by an end
   of line character sequence.

2.  Applicability Statement

   The formats and algorithms defined in this document may be used in
   any context, whether for IETF documents or in other situations where
   structured folding is desired.

   Within the IETF, this work primarily targets the xml2rfc v3
   <sourcecode> element (Section 2.48 of [RFC7991]) and the xml2rfc v2
   <artwork> element (Section 2.5 of [RFC7749]) that, for lack of a
   better option, is currently used for both source code and artwork.
   This work may be also be used for the xml2rfc v3 <artwork> element
   (Section 2.5 of [RFC7991]) but, as described in Section 5.1, it is
   generally not recommended.

3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  Goals

4.1.  Automated Folding of Long Lines in Text Content

   Automated folding of long lines is needed in order to support draft
   compilations that entail a) validation of source input files (e.g.,
   XML, JSON, ABNF, ASN.1) and/or b) dynamic generation of output, using
   a tool that doesn't observe line lengths, that is stitched into the
   final document to be submitted.

   Generally, in order for tooling to be able to process input files,
   the files must be in their original/natural state, which may entail
   them having some long lines.  Thus, these source files need to be
   modified before inclusion in the document in order to satisfy the
   line length limits.  This modification SHOULD be automated to reduce
   effort and errors resulting from manual processing.

   Similarly, dynamically generated output (e.g., tree diagrams) must
   also be modified, if necessary, in order for the resulting document
   to satisfy the line length limits.  When needed, this effort again
   SHOULD be automated to reduce effort and errors resulting from manual
   processing.

4.2.  Automated Reconstitution of the Original Text Content

   Automated reconstitution of the exact original text content is needed
   to support validation of text-based content extracted from documents.

   For instance, already YANG [RFC7950] modules are extracted from
   Internet-Drafts and validated as part of the draft-submission
   process.  Additionally, the desire to validate instance examples
   (i.e., XML/JSON documents) contained within Internet-Drafts has been
   discussed ([yang-doctors-thread]).

5.  Limitations

5.1.  Not Recommended for Graphical Artwork

   While the solution presented in this document works on any kind of
   text-based content, it is most useful on content that represents
   source code (XML, JSON, etc.) or, more generally, on content that has
   not been laid out in two dimensions (e.g., diagrams).

   Fundamentally, the issue is whether the text content remains readable
   once folded.  Text content that is unpredictable is especially
   susceptible to looking bad when folded; falling into this category
   are most UML diagrams, YANG tree diagrams, and ASCII art in general.

   It is NOT RECOMMENDED to use the solution presented in this document
   on graphical artwork.

5.2.  Doesn't Work as Well as Format-Specific Options

   The solution presented in this document works generically for all
   text-based content, as it only views content as plain text.  However,
   various formats sometimes have built-in mechanisms that are better
   suited to prevent long lines.

   For instance, both the `pyang` and `yanglint` utilities have the
   command line option "--tree-line-length" that can be used to indicate
   a desired maximum line length for when generating tree diagrams
   [RFC8340].

   In another example, some source formats (e.g., YANG [RFC7950]) allow
   any quoted string to be broken up into substrings separated by a
   concatenation character (e.g., '+'), any of which can be on a
   different line.

   It is RECOMMENDED that authors do as much as possible within the
   selected format to avoid long lines.

6.  Two Folding Strategies

   This document defines two nearly identical strategies for folding
   text-based content.

      The Single Backslash Strategy ('\'):  Uses a backslash ('\')
         character at the end of the line where folding occurs, and
         assumes that the continuation begins at the character that is
         not a space character (' ') on the following line.

      The Double Backslash Strategy ('\\'):  Uses a backslash ('\')
         character at the end of the line where folding occurs, and
         assumes that the continuation begins after a second backslash
         ('\') character on the following line.

6.1.  Comparison

   The first strategy produces more readable output, however it is
   significantly more likely to encounter unfoldable input (e.g., there
   exists a line anywhere in the input ending with a backslash
   character, or there exists a long line containing only space
   characters) and, for long lines that can be folded, automation
   implementations may encounter scenarios that will produce errors
   without special care.

   The second strategy produces less readable output, but is unlikely to
   encounter unfoldable input, there are no long lines that cannot be
   folded, and no special care is required for when folding a long line.

6.2.  Recommendation

   It is RECOMMENDED for implementations to first attempt to fold
   content using the single backslash strategy and, only in the unlikely
   event that it cannot fold the input or the folding logic is unable to
   cope with a contingency occurring on the desired folding column, then
   fallback to the double backslash strategy.

7.  The Single Backslash Strategy ('\')

7.1.  Folded Structure

   Text content that has been folded as specified by this strategy MUST
   adhere to the following structure.

Internet-Draft      Handling Long Lines in Inclusions          June 2019


7.1.1.  Header

   The header is two lines long.

   The first line is the following 45-character string that MAY be
   surrounded by any number of printable characters.  This first line
   cannot itself be folded.

   NOTE: '\' line wrapping per BCP XX (RFC XXXX)

   [Note to RFC Editor: Please replace XX and XXXX with the numbers
   assigned to this document and delete this note.  Please make this
   change in multiple places in this document.]

   The second line is a blank line.  This line provides visual
   separation for readability.

7.1.2.  Body

   The character encoding is the same as described in Section 2 of
   [RFC7994], except that, per [RFC7991], tab characters are prohibited.

   Lines that have a backslash ('\') occurring as the last character in
   a line are considered "folded".

   Really long lines may be folded multiple times.

7.2.  Algorithm

   This section describes a process for folding and unfolding long lines
   when they are encountered in text content.

   The steps are complete, but implementations MAY achieve the same
   result in other ways.

   When a larger document contains multiple instances of text content
   that may need to be folded or unfolded, another process must insert/
   extract the individual text content instances to/from the larger
   document prior to utilizing the algorithms described in this section.
   For example, the `xiax` utility [xiax] does this.

7.2.1.  Folding

   Determine the desired maximum line length from input to the line-
   wrapping process, such as from a command line parameter.  If no value
   is explicitly specified, the value "69" SHOULD be used.

   Ensure that the desired maximum line length is not less than the
   minimum header, which is 45 characters.  If the desired maximum line
   length is less than this minimum, exit (this text-based content
   cannot be folded).

   Scan the text content for horizontal tab characters.  If any
   horizontal tab characters appear, either resolve them to space
   characters or exit, forcing the input provider to convert them to
   space characters themselves first.

   Scan the text content to ensure at least one line exceeds the desired
   maximum.  If no line exceeds the desired maximum, exit (this text
   content does not need to be folded).

   Scan the text content to ensure no existing lines already end with a
   backslash ('\') character, as this would lead to an ambiguous result.
   If such a line is found, exit (this text content cannot be folded).

   If this text content needs to and can be folded, insert the header
   described in Section 7.1.1, ensuring that any additional printable
   characters surrounding the header does not result in a line exceeding
   the desired maximum.

   For each line in the text content, from top-to-bottom, if the line
   exceeds the desired maximum, then fold the line by:

   1.  Determine where the fold will occur.  This location MUST be
       before or at the desired maximum column, and MUST NOT be chosen
       such that the character immediately after the fold is a space ('
       ') character.  If no such location can be found, then exit (this
       text content cannot be folded)

   2.  At the location where the fold is to occur, insert a backslash
       ('\') character followed by the end of line character sequence.

   3.  On the following line, insert any number of space (' ')
       characters.

   The result of the previous operation is that the next line starts
   with an arbitrary number of space (' ') characters, followed by the
   character that was previously occupying the position where the fold
   occurred.

   Continue in this manner until reaching the end of the text content.
   Note that this algorithm naturally addresses the case where the
   remainder of a folded line is still longer than the desired maximum,
   and hence needs to be folded again, ad infinitum.

   The process described in this section is illustrated by the
   "fold_it_1()" function in Appendix A.

7.2.2.  Unfolding

   Scan the beginning of the text content for the header described in
   Section 7.1.1.  If the header is not present, starting on the first
   line of the text content, exit (this text contents does not need to
   be unfolded).

   Remove the 2-line header from the text content.

   For each line in the text content, from top-to-bottom, if the line
   has a backslash ('\') character immediately followed by the end of
   line character sequence, then the line can be unfolded.  Remove the
   backslash ('\') character, the end of line character sequence, and
   any leading space (' ') characters, which will bring up the next
   line.  Then continue to scan each line in the text content starting
   with the current line (in case it was multiply folded).

   Continue in this manner until reaching the end of the text content.

   The process described in this section is illustrated by the
   "unfold_it_1()" function in Appendix A.

8.  The Double Backslash Strategy ('\\')

8.1.  Folded Structure

   Text content that has been folded as specified by this strategy MUST
   adhere to the following structure.

8.1.1.  Header

   The header is two lines long.

   The first line is the following 46-character string that MAY be
   surrounded by any number of printable characters.  This first line
   cannot itself be folded.

   NOTE: '\\' line wrapping per BCP XX (RFC XXXX)

   [Note to RFC Editor: Please replace XX and XXXX with the numbers
   assigned to this document and delete this note.  Please make this
   change in multiple places in this document.]

   The second line is a blank line.  This line provides visual
   separation for readability.

8.1.2.  Body

   The character encoding is the same as described in Section 2 of
   [RFC7994], except that, per [RFC7991], tab characters are prohibited.

   Lines that have a backslash ('\') occurring as the last character in
   a line immediately followed by the end of line character sequence,
   when the subsequent line starts with a backslash ('\') as the first
   non-space (' ') character, are considered "folded".

   Really long lines may be folded multiple times.

8.2.  Algorithm

   This section describes a process for folding and unfolding long lines
   when they are encountered in text content.

   The steps are complete, but implementations MAY achieve the same
   result in other ways.

   When a larger document contains multiple instances of text content
   that may need to be folded or unfolded, another process must insert/
   extract the individual text content instances to/from the larger
   document prior to utilizing the algorithms described in this section.
   For example, the `xiax` utility [xiax] does this.

8.2.1.  Folding

   Determine the desired maximum line length from input to the line-
   wrapping process, such as from a command line parameter.  If no value
   is explicitly specified, the value "69" SHOULD be used.

   Ensure that the desired maximum line length is not less than the
   minimum header, which is 46 characters.  If the desired maximum line
   length is less than this minimum, exit (this text-based content
   cannot be folded).

   Scan the text content for horizontal tab characters.  If any
   horizontal tab characters appear, either resolve them to space
   characters or exit, forcing the input provider to convert them to
   space characters themselves first.

   Scan the text content to see if any line exceeds the desired maximum.
   If no line exceeds the desired maximum, exit (this text content does
   not need to be folded).

   Scan the text content to ensure no existing lines already end with a
   backslash ('\') character while the subsequent line starts with a

   backslash ('\') character as the first non-space (' ') character, as
   this could lead to an ambiguous result.  If such a line is found, and
   its width is less than the desired maximum, then it SHOULD be flagged
   for forced folding (folding even though unnecessary).  If the folding
   implementation doesn't support forced foldings, it MUST exit.

   If this text content needs to and can be folded, insert the header
   described in Section 8.1.1, ensuring that any additional printable
   characters surrounding the header does not result in a line exceeding
   the desired maximum.

   For each line in the text content, from top-to-bottom, if the line
   exceeds the desired maximum, or requires a forced folding, then fold
   the line by:

   1.  Determine where the fold will occur.  This location MUST be
       before or at the desired maximum column.

   2.  At the location where the fold is to occur, insert a first
       backslash ('\') character followed by the end of line character
       sequence.

   3.  On the following line, insert any number of space (' ')
       characters followed by a second backslash ('\') character.

   The result of the previous operation is that the next line starts
   with an arbitrary number of space (' ') characters, followed by a
   backslash ('\') character, immediately followed by the character that
   was previously occupying the position where the fold occurred.

   Continue in this manner until reaching the end of the text content.
   Note that this algorithm naturally addresses the case where the
   remainder of a folded line is still longer than the desired maximum,
   and hence needs to be folded again, ad infinitum.

   The process described in this section is illustrated by the
   "fold_it_2()" function in Appendix A.

8.2.2.  Unfolding

   Scan the beginning of the text content for the header described in
   Section 8.1.1.  If the header is not present, starting on the first
   line of the text content, exit (this text content does not need to be
   unfolded).

   Remove the 2-line header from the text content.

   For each line in the text content, from top-to-bottom, if the line
   has a backslash ('\') character immediately followed by the end of
   line character sequence, and if the next line has a backslash ('\')
   character as the first non-space (' ') character, then the lines can
   be unfolded.  Remove the first backslash ('\') character, the end of
   line character sequence, any leading space (' ') characters, and the
   second backslash ('\') character, which will bring up the next line.
   Then continue to scan each line in the text content starting with the
   current line (in case it was multiply folded).

   Continue in this manner until reaching the end of the text content.

   The process described in this section is illustrated by the
   "unfold_it_2()" function in Appendix A.

9.  Examples

   The following self-documenting examples illustrate folded text-based
   content.

   The source text content cannot be presented here, as it would again
   be folded.  Alas, only the results can be provided.

9.1.  Example Showing Boundary Conditions

   This example illustrates boundary condition.  The input contains
   seven lines, each line one character longer than the previous line.
   Numbers for counting purposes.  The default desired maximum column
   value "69" is used.

Appendix A.  POSIX Shell Script: rfcfold

   This non-normative appendix section includes a shell script that can
   both fold and unfold text content using both the single and double
   backslash strategies described in Section 7 and Section 8
   respectively.

   This script is intended to be applied to a single text content
   instance.  If it is desired to fold or unfold text content instances
   within a larger document (e.g., an Internet draft or RFC), then
   another tool must be used to extract the content from the larger
   document before utilizing this script.

   For readability purposes, this script forces the minimally supported
   line length to be eight characters longer than the raw header text
   defined in Section 7.1.1 and Section 8.1.1 so as to ensure that the
   header can be wrapped by a space (' ') character and three equal
   ('=') characters on each side of the raw header text.

   This script does not implement the "forced folding" logic described
   in Section 8.2.1.  In such cases the script will exit with the
   message:

          Error: infile has a line ending with a '\' character
          followed by a '\' character as the first non-space
          character on the next line.  This script cannot fold
          this file using '\\' strategy without there being
          false positives produced in the unfolding (i.e., this
          script does not attempt to proactively force-fold such
          lines, as described in RFC XXXX).

   Shell-level end-of-line backslash ('\') characters have been
   purposely added to the script so as to ensure that the script is
   itself not folded in this document, thus simplify the ability to
   copy/paste the script for local use.  As should be evident by the
   lack of the mandatory header described in Section 7.1.1, these
   backslashes do not designate a folded line, such as described in
   Section 7.

   <CODE BEGINS>

   #!/bin/bash --posix
   # must use `bash` (not `sh`)

   # This script may need some adjustments to work on a given system.
   # For instance, the utilities `pcregrep` and `gsed` may need to
   # be installed.
