1.  Introduction

   This document defines four scope modifiers to be used in intellectual
   property declarations.  These modifiers are used with resources in
   interoperable environments, such Internet.  They help to abstract the
   intellectual property relationship of resources.

   Four modifiers are defined.  The PUBLIC, PROTECTED and PRIVATE
   modifiers are transpositions of the class programming equivalents.  A
   fourth modifier -- the INTERNET modifier--  works as a no-country
   restriction: it allows transformation of a private resource, but does
   not allow to reproduce it.

   The following declaration illustrates a typical usage of PUBLIC and
   PRIVATE modifiers in the I.P.  declaration.  The declaration states
   that OwnerB's private resource (the client resource) is a derivative
   version of OwnerA's public resource (the server resource).

       Private&#169; 2004, OwnerB (http://www.client.com)
       & Public&#169; 2002-2004, OwnerA (http://www.server.com)

1.1  Intended audience

   No special knowledge is expected from readers.  However, some
   concepts have a background and rely on a vocabulary that is more
   familiar to specialized readers:
   o  The Objet Oriented languages, for Public, Private and Protected
      scope definitions; [CPPREF]
   o  Intellectual property rights, for the Public versus Private
      understanding of ownership.  [USC17-PD]

1.2  Definitions

   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY BASED OBJECT (IP OBJECT) is an instance of a
   work, as defined in Berne Convention (art.2) [BERNE].

   OWNERSHIP covers the intellectual rights held by the owner on some IP
   Object.  Ownership is defined in Berne Convention (art.5) [BERNE].

   URI is the Universal Resource Identifier, as defined in [RFC2396].

   RESOURCE is an IP object defined unambiguously by its URI and its
   related Ownership.

   SCOPE, as used in this document, defines the way a resource becomes
   available for operations such exhibition (access), execution,

Internet-Draft                Internet(C)                      June 2004


   reproduction or transformation.  Modifiers may be used to alter the
   scope of the resource.

   A SERVER RESOURCE is a resource which has been copied, or
   transformed, to create a client resource.  A CLIENT RESOURCE is a
   resource which refers to the corresponding server resource.
   A VERSION is a client resource, which is the result of a
   transformation.

   INTEROPERABILITY is defined in the IEEE Standard Computer Dictionary
   [IEEE 90].

   INTERNET is an interoperable environment of RESOURCES.
   In this document, INTERNET is a scope modifier for IP objects.  It
   works as a no-country restriction declaration.  The INTERNET modifier
   allows the transformation, but does not allows to reproduce the
   resource.

1.3  Requirement notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Scope Modifiers

   Scope modifiers are tokens used in I.P.  declarations to modify the
   availability of resources for exhibition, execution, reproduction or
   transformation.

   Resource semantics are defined using two criteria: URI, and
   Ownership.  Two URI may point to the same resource, or to duplicated
   resources.  However, one URI cannot access two resources, as they
   belong to different owners.

2.1  Categories of access operations

   A resource is defined by URI and Ownership.  These two criteria are
   illustrated by two questions:
   o  Does the operation on resource generate a new URI?
   o  Who is the owner of the client resource (if created)?

   Four operations are defined as follows:

     EXHIBIT     The Owner creates the original URI used to access
                 the IP object. Exhibition is done by the same holder
                 holds the Ownership on the IP object: the author.

     EXECUTE     There is no URI creation. A new instance of the IP
                 object is performed. Any instance of the object is
                 volatile and there is no client resource.
                 The ownership of the resource remains unchanged.

     REPRODUCE   A new, persistent URI is created, and a client
                 resource is exhibited under this URI. There is no
                 matter the underlying IP object is physically the
                 same, or a simple duplicate. The ownership of both
                 server and client resources belongs to the same owner.

     TRANSFORM   A new, persistent URI is created, and a client
                 version of the IP object is exhibited under this URI.
                 The ownership of the version belongs to exhibitor of
                 the version. The ownership of server and client
                 resources is different, even if exhibitors are the
                 same person.

   Some notes to understand correctly the two first operations:
   o  An exhibited resource is a work protected under (Berne-2), whether
      published or not (Berne-3,1a).
   o  Execution is a performance, as used in Berne-3,3, and it is not
      equivalent to publishing.
   The word EXECUTION is usually used with software, but this document



Maturana & Robredo     Expires December 17, 2004                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                Internet(C)                      June 2004


   designs as EXECUTION any operation which does not imply URI creation,
   nor Ownership differentiation.

   For example, let us consider an author who exhibits an article in
   Internet and allows people to read its contents.  This operation is a
   performance of the work equivalent to a public recitation.  The
   difference is that recitation will be done directly by users (author
   does not actually recites the article).  This difference is
   introduced by Internet interoperability properties but, technically,
   the performance is still the same: a recitation.  Having regard to
   the nature of each resource, the word EXECUTION will apply for all
   these operations.

2.2  Defining modifiers

   The key concepts are the URI and the Ownership of the resource.

   In this document, the creation of a new URI is the formal criteria
   used to make difference between EXECUTION and REPRODUCTION.  In other
   words, the difference between a simple EXECUTION (by the owner) and a
   true REPRODUCTION (by another exhibitor) raises when a new URI is
   defined for the copied resource.

   Conversely, Ownership introduces a semantic difference between
   EXHIBITION and TRANSFORMATION.  EXHIBITION is provided by the owner
   of the resource itself.  Instead, TRANSFORMATION is always done by
   another user, who is also the owner of this client version.  In other
   words, the difference in Ownership determines the semantic difference
   between a simple exhibition (without URI creation) and a full
   transformation (always under a new URI)

   The following table compares URI creation and ownership:


        Operation    |Client URI   Ownership
                     | Creation    of resources
        -------------|--------------------------------
        EXHIBIT      |  --         --
        EXECUTE      |  --         --
        REPRODUCE    |  Yes        Same owner
        TRANSFORM    |  Yes        Separate owners
        ----------------------------------------------

   As a complementary observation, we notice that execution MUST precede
   any reproduction or a transform operations, while exhibition SHALL
   follow a transformation.

   Given the authorization to EXECUTE, the intellectual property

Internet-Draft                Internet(C)                      June 2004


   declaration will combine the REPRODUCTION and TRANSFORM possibilities
   to define four scope modifiers, as shown by the following table:

               If owner allows to...           | Scope is
            EXECUTE   TRANSFORM    REPRODUCE   | defined as:
         ---------------------------------------------------------
             Yes         No         No         |  PRIVATE
             Yes         No         Yes        |  PROTECTED
             Yes         Yes        No         |  INTERNET
             Yes         Yes        Yes        |  PUBLIC
         ---------------------------------------------------------


2.3  PRIVATE modifier

   PRIVATE is (in most countries) the default modifier.  By default, the
   EXECUTION of a PRIVATE resource is restricted to the owner only.  No
   reproduction, no transformation of the resource is allowed.

2.4  PROTECTED modifier

   PROTECTED scope mode is typically defined by a license.  PROTECTED
   scope will allow (at least once) the REPRODUCTION of the resource.
   But the TRANSFORMATION of the resource is not allowed.

   The PROTECTED modifier may be used for collective projects managed by
   licenses who allows some modification on resources, but do not
   recognize the ownership of exhibitors on their own versions.

2.5  INTERNET modifier

   INTERNET scope allows transformation of private resources that are
   exhibited on interoperable environment, such Internet.  However,
   REPRODUCTION is not allowed: creation of duplicate versions is
   prohibited.
   INTERNET works like a legal country excluder, but it excludes all
   countries.

   INTERNET modifier determines three specific behaviors:
   o  Transformation and exhibition of versions are allowed.
   o  All versions MUST follow-up the same INTERNET scope declaration.
   o  All versions MUST refer to the same server resource.

   Internet modifier is a country restriction applied on a private
   resource, exhibited on Internet.
   This will become clear if we consider that transformation is a basic
   human right.  Berne does not disallow transformation, however it
   prevents prejudice on private interests  of the server resource

   owner.
   While the no-country clause is in force, INTERNET modifier allows
   people to transform and exhibit the resource on Internet.  However,
   the resource is still PRIVATE: all rights are reserved in all
   countries.

2.6  PUBLIC modifier

   PUBLIC scope may be seen as a non-restricted mode.  It simply means
   that the owner does not prohibit reproduction or execution of the
   resource, or transformation and exhibition of new versions.
   o  PUBLIC scope must not be confused with "public domain" as defined
      in some Countries.  The owner of a PUBLIC resource keeps the full
      control on the resource.
   o  PUBLIC scope must not be confused with PROTECTED scope, because
      TRANSFORMATION of resources is allowed without restriction.
      Exhibitors are also owners of the new versions.
   o  PUBLIC scope is not a PRIVATE scope, because REPRODUCTION is
      explicitly allowed.  It is possible to duplicate and even to sell
      copies of resource in any country.

2.7  Consistency in client modifiers

   This document does not define precedence rules for scope modifiers.
   However, consistency is required when applying modifiers.

   Given 2 resources, the scope modifier in the client declaration MUST
   be either the same or a more restrictive modifier than server.


     Server      |      Client resource may be:
     resource is |   Private  Protected Public Internet
     ----------------------------------------------------
     PRIVATE     |    Yes     --        --      --
     PROTECTED   |    Yes     Yes       --      --
     PUBLIC      |    Yes     Yes       Yes     Yes
     -----------------------------------------------------
     INTERNET    |    --      --        --      Yes
     -----------------------------------------------------


   INTERNET modifier MUST follow-up because the "no-country scope"
   already excludes all countries.  It works on behalf a PRIVATE
   modifier, which is in force in all excluded countries.

3.  Declaration Syntax Description

   This chapter describes the RECOMMENDED syntax of declaration of IP
   objects, when using scope modifiers.

3.1  Formal declaration

   The formal declaration is a 2-lines or 3-lines declaration, described
   as follow:

   The 2-lines declaration is the basic declaration:

      [modifier](C) [date][owner]              (Property line)
      [standard assertion or license link]     (License line)

    The 3-lines declaration include an Attribution line, and is used for
   client resource declarations:

      [modifier](C) [date][owner]              (Property line)
      & [modifier](C) [date][owner]            (Attribution line)
      [standard assertion or license link]     (License line)

   o  Property line MUST appear.
   o  Attribution MUST appear when the resource is a client resource.
   o  License line is OPTIONAL.

   Here is an example of a client Internet declaration:

       Internet&#169; 2004, ClientOwner (client-owner@clientsite.com)
       & Internet&#169; 2004, ServerOwner (server-owner@serversite.com)
       All rights reserved in all countries.


3.2  Property line

   Property line MUST appear for all modifiers.  The Property line is
   composed of:
   o  a scope modifier: Private, Protected, Public, Internet
   o  the (C) symbol
   o  the date of first exhibition, oftentimes followed by the date of
      the last update
   o  the name of the resource owner, sometimes followed by address or
      email.
   o  any optional information, such the URI of the resource or email
      address.

Internet-Draft                Internet(C)                      June 2004


               Modifier                 Scope
               -------------------------------------
               (none)                  PRIVATE
               [Private](C)            PRIVATE
               Protected(C)            PROTECTED
               Public(C)               PUBLIC
               Internet(C)             INTERNET
               -------------------------------------

   The (C) symbol MUST follow the scope modifier.  The (C) symbol MUST
   appears, even if not required by the Country Law.

   Two examples:

       Internet&#169; 2004, OwnerName (owner-x@somesite.com)

       Public&#169; 2002-2004, OwnerName (owner-x@somesite.com)


3.3  Attribution line

   Attribution MUST appear when the resource is a client resource.  The
   Attribution line indicates that the resource is a duplicate or a
   version of a server resource.

   The use of an AMPERSAND sign ('&') in front of Attribution line is
   RECOMMENDED.
   The syntax of Attribution line is otherwise similar to the Property
   line itself.

       Internet&#169; 2004, OwnerC (http://www.clientC.com)
       & Internet&#169; 2002-2004, OwnerB (http://www.client_server.com)
       & Public&#169; 2002, OwnerA (http://www.server.org)


3.4  License line

   License line is OPTIONAL, and may be used with any modifier.  If
   used, license line SHALL override the semantic of the modifier.

   With 2-lines syntax, the license line appears after the Property
   line.  With 3-lines syntax, it appears after the Attribution line.

   The License line usually rely on conventional expressions, used in
   the Owner's language or country.  The following examples are provided
   in English and French.

       Private&#169; 2004, Owner (http://www.clienttranslation.com)

4.  Using modifiers


4.1  Defaut modifier

   For Countries that are members of Berne, the PRIVATE modifier is the
   default modifier, and it is optional.  The following declaration:

       &#169; 2004, OwnerX (owner-x@somesite.com)

   is equivalent to:

       Private&#169; 2004, OwnerX (owner-x@somesite.com)

   If PRIVATE is not used as default, and License line is missing, then
   the PROTECTED, PUBLIC or INTERNET modifiers SHOULD APPEAR.

       Internet&#169; 2004, OwnerX (owner-x@somesite.com)


4.2  Allowing interoperability of resources

   Scope modifiers are well suited to promote (or restrict) the
   interoperability of resources in environments such Internet.  The
   syntax of IP declarations allows automated dissemination of INTERNET
   and PUBLIC objects, for example, by robots.

   It is RECOMMENDED to include licenses that will enlarge the I.P.
   scope of the resource modifier.  Some software licenses provide
   PROTECTED resources which may be modified.  Conversely, a license may
   allow an INTERNET resource to be copied (and sold) in the country of
   the licensee: for example, a book published with original and
   translation versions.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines four scope modifiers to be used in intellectual
   property declarations.  These modifiers are used with resources in
   interoperable environments, such Internet.  They help to abstract the
   intellectual property relationship of resources.

   Four modifiers are defined.  The PUBLIC, PROTECTED and PRIVATE
   modifiers are transpositions of the class programming equivalents.  A
   fourth modifier -- the INTERNET modifier--  works as a no-country
   restriction: it allows transformation of a private resource, but does
   not allow to reproduce it.

   The following declaration illustrates a typical usage of PUBLIC and
   PRIVATE modifiers in the I.P.  declaration.  The declaration states
   that OwnerB's private resource (the client resource) is a derivative
   version of OwnerA's public resource (the server resource).

       Private&#169; 2004, OwnerB (http://www.client.com)
       & Public&#169; 2002-2004, OwnerA (http://www.server.com)
       All rights reserved.


1.1  Intended audience

   No special knowledge is expected from readers.  However, some
   concepts have a background and rely on a vocabulary that is more
   familiar to specialized readers:
   o  The Objet Oriented languages, for Public, Private and Protected
      scope definitions; [CPPREF]
   o  Intellectual property rights, for the Public versus Private
      understanding of ownership.  [USC17-PD]

1.2  Definitions

   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY BASED OBJECT (IP OBJECT) is an instance of a
   work, as defined in Berne Convention (art.2) [BERNE].

   OWNERSHIP covers the intellectual rights held by the owner on some IP
   Object.  Ownership is defined in Berne Convention (art.5) [BERNE].

   URI is the Universal Resource Identifier, as defined in [RFC2396].

   RESOURCE is an IP object defined unambiguously by its URI and its
   related Ownership.

   SCOPE, as used in this document, defines the way a resource becomes
   available for operations such exhibition (access), execution,

   reproduction or transformation.  Modifiers may be used to alter the
   scope of the resource.

   A SERVER RESOURCE is a resource which has been copied, or
   transformed, to create a client resource.  A CLIENT RESOURCE is a
   resource which refers to the corresponding server resource.
   A VERSION is a client resource, which is the result of a
   transformation.

   INTEROPERABILITY is defined in the IEEE Standard Computer Dictionary
   [IEEE 90].

   INTERNET is an interoperable environment of RESOURCES.
   In this document, INTERNET is a scope modifier for IP objects.  It
   works as a no-country restriction declaration.  The INTERNET modifier
   allows the transformation, but does not allows to reproduce the
   resource.

1.3  Requirement notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Scope Modifiers

   Scope modifiers are tokens used in I.P.  declarations to modify the
   availability of resources for exhibition, execution, reproduction or
   transformation.

   Resource semantics are defined using two criteria: URI, and
   Ownership.  Two URI may point to the same resource, or to duplicated
   resources.  However, one URI cannot access two resources, as they
   belong to different owners.

2.1  Categories of access operations

   A resource is defined by URI and Ownership.  These two criteria are
   illustrated by two questions:
   o  Does the operation on resource generate a new URI?
   o  Who is the owner of the client resource (if created)?

   Four operations are defined as follows:

     EXHIBIT     The Owner creates the original URI used to access
                 the IP object. Exhibition is done by the same holder
                 holds the Ownership on the IP object: the author.

     EXECUTE     There is no URI creation. A new instance of the IP
                 object is performed. Any instance of the object is
                 volatile and there is no client resource.
                 The ownership of the resource remains unchanged.

     REPRODUCE   A new, persistent URI is created, and a client
                 resource is exhibited under this URI. There is no
                 matter the underlying IP object is physically the
                 same, or a simple duplicate. The ownership of both
                 server and client resources belongs to the same owner.

     TRANSFORM   A new, persistent URI is created, and a client
                 version of the IP object is exhibited under this URI.
                 The ownership of the version belongs to exhibitor of
                 the version. The ownership of server and client
                 resources is different, even if exhibitors are the
                 same person.

   Some notes to understand correctly the two first operations:
   o  An exhibited resource is a work protected under (Berne-2), whether
      published or not (Berne-3,1a).
   o  Execution is a performance, as used in Berne-3,3, and it is not
      equivalent to publishing.
   The word EXECUTION is usually used with software, but this document



Maturana & Robredo      Expires January 10, 2005                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                Internet(C)                      July 2004


   designs as EXECUTION any operation which does not imply URI creation,
   nor Ownership differentiation.

   For example, let us consider an author who exhibits an article in
   Internet and allows people to read its contents.  This operation is a
   performance of the work equivalent to a public recitation.  The
   difference is that recitation will be done directly by users (author
   does not actually recites the article).  This difference is
   introduced by Internet interoperability properties but, technically,
   the performance is still the same: a recitation.  Having regard to
   the nature of each resource, the word EXECUTION will apply for all
   these operations.

2.2  Defining modifiers

   The key concepts are the URI and the Ownership of the resource.

   In this document, the creation of a new URI is the formal criteria
   used to make difference between EXECUTION and REPRODUCTION.  In other
   words, the difference between a simple EXECUTION (by the owner) and a
   true REPRODUCTION (by another exhibitor) raises when a new URI is
   defined for the copied resource.

   Conversely, Ownership introduces a semantic difference between
   EXHIBITION and TRANSFORMATION.  EXHIBITION is provided by the owner
   of the resource itself.  Instead, TRANSFORMATION is always done by
   another user, who is also the owner of this client version.  In other
   words, the difference in Ownership determines the semantic difference
   between a simple exhibition (without URI creation) and a full
   transformation (always under a new URI)

   The following table compares URI creation and ownership:


        Operation    |Client URI   Ownership
                     | Creation    of resources
        -------------|--------------------------------
        EXHIBIT      |  --         --
        EXECUTE      |  --         --
        REPRODUCE    |  Yes        Same owner
        TRANSFORM    |  Yes        Separate owners
        ----------------------------------------------

   As a complementary observation, we notice that execution MUST precede
   any reproduction or a transform operations, while exhibition SHALL
   follow a transformation.

   Given the authorization to EXECUTE, the intellectual property

Internet-Draft                Internet(C)                      July 2004


   declaration will combine the REPRODUCTION and TRANSFORM possibilities
   to define four scope modifiers, as shown by the following table:

               If owner allows to...           | Scope is
            EXECUTE   TRANSFORM    REPRODUCE   | defined as:
         ---------------------------------------------------------
             Yes         No         No         |  PRIVATE
             Yes         No         Yes        |  PROTECTED
             Yes         Yes        No         |  INTERNET
             Yes         Yes        Yes        |  PUBLIC
         ---------------------------------------------------------


2.3  PRIVATE modifier

   PRIVATE is (in most countries) the default modifier.  By default, the
   EXECUTION of a PRIVATE resource is restricted to the owner only.  No
   reproduction, no transformation of the resource is allowed.

2.4  PROTECTED modifier

   PROTECTED scope mode is typically defined by a license.  PROTECTED
   scope will allow (at least once) the REPRODUCTION of the resource.
   But the TRANSFORMATION of the resource is not allowed.

   The PROTECTED modifier may be used for collective projects managed by
   licenses who allows some modification on resources, but do not
   recognize the ownership of exhibitors on their own versions.

2.5  INTERNET modifier

   INTERNET scope allows transformation of private resources that are
   exhibited on interoperable environment, such Internet.  However,
   REPRODUCTION is not allowed: creation of duplicate versions is
   prohibited.
   INTERNET works like a legal country excluder, but it excludes all
   countries.

   INTERNET modifier determines three specific behaviors:
   o  Transformation and exhibition of versions are allowed.
   o  All versions MUST follow-up the same INTERNET scope declaration.
   o  All versions MUST refer to the same server resource.

   Internet modifier is a country restriction applied on a private
   resource, exhibited on Internet.
   This will become clear if we consider that transformation is a basic
   human right.  Berne does not disallow transformation, however it
   prevents prejudice on private interests  of the server resource

Internet-Draft                Internet(C)                      July 2004


   owner.
   While the no-country clause is in force, INTERNET modifier allows
   people to transform and exhibit the resource on Internet.  However,
   the resource is still PRIVATE: all rights are reserved in all
   countries.

2.6  PUBLIC modifier

   PUBLIC scope may be seen as a non-restricted mode.  It simply means
   that the owner does not prohibit reproduction or execution of the
   resource, or transformation and exhibition of new versions.
   o  PUBLIC scope must not be confused with "public domain" as defined
      in some Countries.  The owner of a PUBLIC resource keeps the full
      control on the resource.
   o  PUBLIC scope must not be confused with PROTECTED scope, because
      TRANSFORMATION of resources is allowed without restriction.
      Exhibitors are also owners of the new versions.
   o  PUBLIC scope is not a PRIVATE scope, because REPRODUCTION is
      explicitly allowed.  It is possible to duplicate and even to sell
      copies of resource in any country.

2.7  Consistency in client modifiers

   This document does not define precedence rules for scope modifiers.
   However, consistency is required when applying modifiers.

   Given 2 resources, the scope modifier in the client declaration MUST
   be either the same or a more restrictive modifier than server.


     Server      |      Client resource may be:
     resource is |   Private  Protected Public Internet
     ----------------------------------------------------
     PRIVATE     |    Yes     --        --      --
     PROTECTED   |    Yes     Yes       --      --
     PUBLIC      |    Yes     Yes       Yes     Yes
     -----------------------------------------------------
     INTERNET    |    --      --        --      Yes
     -----------------------------------------------------


   INTERNET modifier MUST follow-up because the "no-country scope"
   already excludes all countries.  It works on behalf a PRIVATE
   modifier, which is in force in all excluded countries.

3.  Declaration Syntax Description

   This chapter describes the RECOMMENDED syntax of declaration of IP
   objects, when using scope modifiers.

3.1  Formal declaration

   The formal declaration is a 2-lines or 3-lines declaration, described
   as follow:

   The 2-lines declaration is the basic declaration:

      [modifier](C) [date][owner]              (Property line)
      [standard assertion or license link]     (License line)

    The 3-lines declaration include an Attribution line, and is used for
   client resource declarations:

      [modifier](C) [date][owner]              (Property line)
      & [modifier](C) [date][owner]            (Attribution line)
      [standard assertion or license link]     (License line)

   o  Property line MUST appear.
   o  Attribution MUST appear when the resource is a client resource.
   o  License line is OPTIONAL.

   Here is an example of a client Internet declaration:

       Internet&#169; 2004, ClientOwner (client-owner@clientsite.com)
       & Internet&#169; 2004, ServerOwner (server-owner@serversite.com)
       All rights reserved in all countries.


3.2  Property line

   Property line MUST appear for all modifiers.  The Property line is
   composed of:
   o  a scope modifier: Private, Protected, Public, Internet
   o  the (C) symbol
   o  the date of first exhibition, oftentimes followed by the date of
      the last update
   o  the name of the resource owner, sometimes followed by address or
      email.
   o  any optional information, such the URI of the resource or email
      address.

               Modifier                 Scope
               -------------------------------------
               (none)                  PRIVATE
               [Private](C)            PRIVATE
               Protected(C)            PROTECTED
               Public(C)               PUBLIC
               Internet(C)             INTERNET
               -------------------------------------

   The (C) symbol MUST follow the scope modifier.  The (C) symbol MUST
   appears, even if not required by the Country Law.

   Two examples:

       Internet&#169; 2004, OwnerName (owner-x@somesite.com)

       Public&#169; 2002-2004, OwnerName (owner-x@somesite.com)


3.3  Attribution line

   Attribution MUST appear when the resource is a client resource.  The
   Attribution line indicates that the resource is a duplicate or a
   version of a server resource.

   The use of an AMPERSAND sign ('&') in front of Attribution line is
   RECOMMENDED.
   The syntax of Attribution line is otherwise similar to the Property
   line itself.

       Internet&#169; 2004, OwnerC (http://www.clientC.com)
       & Internet&#169; 2002-2004, OwnerB (http://www.client_server.com)
       & Public&#169; 2002, OwnerA (http://www.server.org)


3.4  License line

   License line is OPTIONAL, and may be used with any modifier.  If
   used, license line SHALL override the semantic of the modifier.

   With 2-lines syntax, the license line appears after the Property
   line.  With 3-lines syntax, it appears after the Attribution line.

   The License line usually rely on conventional expressions, used in
   the Owner's language or country.  The following examples are provided
   in English and French.

       Private&#169; 2004, Owner (http://www.clienttranslation.com)

   License-line is commonly used to refer to a detailed license.
   License line is well suited for PROTECTED or INTERNET modifiers, but
   may be included with all scope modifiers.

4.  Using modifiers


4.1  Defaut modifier

   For Countries that are members of Berne, the PRIVATE modifier is the
   default modifier, and it is optional.  The following declaration:

       &#169; 2004, OwnerX (owner-x@somesite.com)

   is equivalent to:

       Private&#169; 2004, OwnerX (owner-x@somesite.com)

   If PRIVATE is not used as default, and License line is missing, then
   the PROTECTED, PUBLIC or INTERNET modifiers SHOULD APPEAR.

       Internet&#169; 2004, OwnerX (owner-x@somesite.com)


4.2  Allowing interoperability of resources

   Scope modifiers are well suited to promote (or restrict) the
   interoperability of resources in environments such Internet.  The
   syntax of IP declarations allows automated dissemination of INTERNET
   and PUBLIC objects, for example, by robots.

   It is RECOMMENDED to include licenses that will enlarge the I.P.
   scope of the resource modifier.  Some software licenses provide
   PROTECTED resources which may be modified.  Conversely, a license may
   allow an INTERNET resource to be copied (and sold) in the country of
   the licensee: for example, a book published with original and
   translation versions.
