1.  Introduction

   The large address space of IPv6 is essential for the massive
   expansion of the network edge that will be caused by "Internet of
   Things (IoT)" technology over low-power or 5G links.  However, the
   size of a raw IPv6 packet header causes difficulty due to the small
   maximum transmission units (MTU) allowed by typical low-power, low-
   cost link layers.  For 5G, this aspect is discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-dmm-5g-uplane-analysis].  Thus header compression,
   including address compression, is an important issue.  This decreases
   the size of raw packets, but compressed IP addresses are not
   routeable except by decompressing them completely in every forwarding
   node.  There are two issues here.  The first is the extra computation
   resource needed for compressing or decompressing in constrained IoT
   nodes.  The second is that full-length IPv6 routing will consume more
   memory to store routing tables and packet queues.  Such resource
   consumption is very undesirable in constrained nodes with limited
   storage, CPU power, and battery capacity.

   To mitigate these issues, here we propose a solution enabling the
   shortening of IPv6 addresses inside packets, and the routing of
   packets according to short addresses, without needing a decompression
   step.  Considering that the scale and size of edge networks may vary
   widely, different lengths of short address can be used in different
   domains.

   This work is distinct from previous 6LoWPAN work on address
   compression [RFC6282] [RFC7400].  Although those solutions tackle the
   problem of small MTU size, they do not address the problem of
   decompression overhead.

2.  Proposed Solution

   The use of IPv6 naturally implies 128-bit addresses for both source
   and destination.  However, this address size is huge by the standards
   of IoT edge networks.  We propose the use of a context parameter to
   indicate the effective length of the IP address for every node in a
   local domain.  If the effective length is N bits, then all addresses
   in the domain are assumed to be preceded by a common prefix of 128-N
   bits, when a full size IPv6 address is needed.  Any node in the
   domain that needs the full address, such as a gateway node to the
   Internet, can therefore easily synthesize it.

   The address length parameter may be needed by every node in the
   domain.  It can be spread by various techniques:

   o  Configure the address length in every node.

   o  Obtain the address length from a gateway (next hop router) node.

   o  Negotiate the address length between neighbors.

   The solution operates by shortening IP address fields to save
   overhead.  To enhance this, we propose a new field named Flexible
   Header Encoding (FHE).  It consists of 8 bits, each indicating
   whether the corresponding IPv6 header field [RFC8200] exists.

      Bit 0 indicates the Modified Version field

      Bit 1 indicates the Traffic Class field

      Bit 2 indicates the Flow Label field.

      Bit 3 indicates the Payload Length field.

      Bit 4 indicates the Next Header field.  (Zero implies "No Next
      Header", value 59)

      Bit 5 indicates the Hop Limit field.

      Bit 6 indicates the Source Address field.

      Bit 7 indicates the Destination Address field.

   The "Version" field is a special case.  In the context of FHE, all
   packets are presumed to be IPv6 so the normal version field has no
   purpose.  The Modified Version field, if present, has the following
   encoded meanings:

      0b0000: The source address (if exist) has pre-determined length
      inside the domain and the destination address (if exist) uses
      standard 128-bit IPv6 address.  (Outward traffic)

      0b0001: The source address (if exist) uses standard 128-bit IPv6
      address and the destination address (if exist) has pre-determined
      length inside the domain.  (Inward traffic)

      0b0010: The source address and destination address have the same
      length inside the domain.  The address length will be pre-
      determined.

      0b1100: Reserved for IPv6 compatible case.

      0b0100: Reserved for IPv4 compatible case.

      0b0011~0b1111(except 0b1100, 0b0100): Reserved.

   All fields, including the Modified Version field, follow the FHE in
   the same order as in [RFC8200], with no padding.  There are no
   alignment requirements, but when a packet is decompressed to a normal
   IPv6 format, padding options as defined in RFC8200 must be inserted.

   One implication of the above is that the source and destination
   addresses may be elided completely if they are implicit.  Sourceless
   packets were originally suggested in [crowcroft].

   Figure 1 illustrates an example of the FHE format.  In this example
   the traffic class, flow label and source address are elided, and the
   destination address is truncated to 16 bits.  The modified version
   field could be 0b0001 or 0b0010.

3.  Address Transformation at the Gateway

   Truncated intra-domain addresses will be used to identify nodes
   inside the domain.  When a packet is sent from an IoT node to an
   external IPv6 host , the node's intra-domain address, which is unique
   in the domain, will be carried in the source address field.  When the
   packet is forwarded outside the domain by a gateway, the intra-domain
   address will be transformed to a complete IPv6 address.  To achieve
   this, the gateway should will maintain a globally routeable prefix
   for all the nodes in the domain.  When a packet with an intra-domain
   source address is received, the gateway extracts this address and
   concatenates it to the prefix to form a standard, globally unique
   IPv6 address.  Vice versa, when IPv6 packets are received from the
   Internet, the prefix will be removed to recover the intra-domain
   short address.

   There are two options for handling the addresses of external hosts
   within the domain.  One is to use their full IPv6 addresses via
   Modified Version codes 0b0000 and 0b0001.  The other is effectively a
   specialized form of Network Address Translation.  Here, the gateway
   will maintain a dynamic mapping table between synthetic intra-domain
   addresses and IPv6 addresses.  As packets are received, the gateway
   performs the appropriate mapping.  The transformation must be
   checksum-neutral for the transport layer, so the methods designed for
   NAT46 should be adapted.

   NOTE IN DRAFT: Details and references TBD.

   It is an engineering choice whether this method is preferable to
   carrying full 128-bit addresses on the IOT side.

4.  Routing without Decompression

   Routing mechanisms may readily be adapted to truncated address sizes.
   If there is routing with an HFE domain, we assume that the truncated
   address size will be split into a prefix and an interface identifier,
   but this will not be at the traditional /64 boundary.  If routing
   between different length addresses is required, a suitably modified
   Forwarding Information Base (FIB) structure is needed, as for any
   variable length addressing scheme.  A truncated address needs to be
   virtually expanded to 128 bits at the router's inbound interface,
   although this may not be the physical implementation.

   A possible routing choice for IOT edge networks is RPL [RFC6550],
   although a more complete survey can be found in [talwar].

5.  Address Configuration

   The simplest approach to address configuration is simply to run
   normal IPv6 procedures (SLAAC or DHCPv6), on the argument that this
   is a rare process and the overhead does not matter.  If the truncated
   address size is less than 64 bits, it will be necessary to use
   shorter interface identifiers than normal, but this is not a major
   change.  Once a node has acquired an IPv6 address and has learned the
   local address length parameter as outlined in Section 2, it can
   continue in HFE mode.

6.  Compatibility with Existing Protocols

   Although HFE nodes can only talk directly to each other, they are
   essentially a special form of IPv6 node and they can communicate with
   the whole IPv6 Internet via gateways.  The complexity is not greater
   than 6LoWPAN.  If appropriate, the 6LoWPAN adaptation layer [RFC4944]
   could be used, with a specific dispatch type.

7.  Security Considerations

   HFE is essentially only a non-cryptographic compression technique so
   it neither adds to nor reduces the intrinsic security of an IPv6
   packet.  The address length parameter is not a secret, since all
   nodes in the domain must know it.  The mechanism for distributing
   this parameter must be no less secure than any other configuration
   mechanism in us.

   Address-based privacy issues must be considered in deciding on the
   address length.  If the number of bits available for the interface
   identifier is significantly less than the 64 currently in use,
   address traceability and guessability will be affected.  [RFC7721]
   and [RFC7217] should be consulted prior to deciding the address
   length.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of the IANA.

   NOTE IN DRAFT: If the solution of a 6LoWPAN dispatch type is adopted,
   a suitable assignment request will be added.
