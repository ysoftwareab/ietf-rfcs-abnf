2.  Abstract

   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management Informa-
   tion Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the
   Internet community.  In particular, it describes managed objects used
   for monitoring selectable performance metrics and statistics derived
   from the monitoring of network packets and sub-application level
   transactions.  The metrics are defined through reference to existing
   IETF, ITU and other standards organizations' documents.  The monitor-
   ing covers both passive and active traffic generation sources.

4.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major compo-
   nents:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC
        1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described
        in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and
        STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of
        the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the mes-
        sage protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906
        [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of proto-
        col operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC
        1905 [RFC1905].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
        in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine

   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

5.  Overview

   This document continues the architecture created in the RMON MIB
   [RFC2021] by providing a major feature upgrade, primarily by provid-
   ing new metrics and studies to assist in the analysis of performance
   for transaction flows in the network, in direct relationship to the
   transporting of application layer protocols.

   Performance monitoring agents have been widely used to analyze the
   parameters and metrics related to the perceived performance of dis-
   tributed applications and services in networks. The metrics collected
   by these agents has ranged from basic response time to a combination
   of metrics related to the loss and re-transmission of datagrams and
   PDUs. While the metrics are becoming more useful in the implementa-
   tion of service level monitoring and troubleshooting tools, the lack
   of a standard method to report these in has limited the deployment to
   very specific customer needs and areas.

   This document is intended to create a general framework for the col-
   lection and reporting of performance related metrics on transaction
   flows in a network. The MIB in this document in directly linked to
   the current RMON-2 MIB [RFC2021] and uses the Protocol Directory as a
   key component in reporting the layering involved in the sub-applica-
   tion level transaction flows.

   The specific objectives of this document are to:

      + Provide a drill-down capability to compliment the user-perceived
      monitoring defined within the APM MIB [APM]. This capability is
      intended to support trouble resolution, further characterization
      of performance, and a finer granularity of monitoring capabili-
      ties. The APM MIB provides a method for retrieving aggregated mea-
      surement data of the end-user's perception of application-level
      performance. APM additionally provides thresholding and associated
      alarms in the event the end-user perceived performance degrades
      below defined thresholds.  The TPM MIB compliments the APM MIB
      capabilities by monitoring sub-application level transaction
      aspects not typically perceived by the end-user. As an example,
      APM MIB provides response time statistics of a typical web-browser
      application. This application typically consists of DNS transac-
      tion, TCP connection establishment (or multiple establishments),
      HTTP download of the base page and multiple downloads of the vari-
      ous embedded objects. Ideally TPM MIB would provide statistics on
      the performance aspects of these multiple sub-application level
      transactions.

INTERNET DRAFT                   TPM MIB                   June 10, 2002


      + Provide additional performance metrics and related statistics.
      For trouble shooting and a finer granularity of performance moni-
      toring, it is useful to provide measurements of additional metrics
      beyond those supported by the APM MIB.

      + Support standards based metrics and associated statistical
      aggregation by defining methods to reference those standards. The
      TPM MIB provides a capability to describe metrics by reference to
      appropriate IETF, ITU or other standards defining metrics. This
      capability is provided through the tpmMetricsDefTable.

      + Provide (as an option) a table storing the measurements of the
      metrics on a transaction by transaction basis. There are times
      when it is useful to have access to the raw measurements. The tpm-
      CurrTable optionally provides access to this capability.


   While this document outlines the basic measurements of performance in
   regard to the transporting of application flows, it does not attempt
   to measure or provide a means to measure the actual perceived perfor-
   mance of the application transactions or quality.  The detailed mea-
   surements of end-user perceived performance is directly related to
   this document and may be found in the APM MIB [APM].

   The objects defined in this document are intended as an interface
   between an RMON agent and an RMON management application and are not
   intended for direct manipulation by humans.  While some users may
   tolerate the direct display of some of these objects, few will toler-
   ate the complexity of manually manipulating objects to accomplish row
   creation.  These functions should be handled by the management appli-
   cation.

5.1.  Terms

   This document uses some terms that need introduction:

   DataSource
        A source of data for monitoring purposes. This term is used
        exactly as defined in the RMON-2 MIB [RFC2021].

   protocol
        A specific protocol encapsulation, as identified for monitoring
        purposes. This term is used exactly as defined in the RMON
        Protocol Identifiers document [RFC2074].

   performance metric
        A specific statistical reporting metric, as identified for
        monitoring purposes.  There can be several metrics reported by

        an agent in the same implementation.  The metrics are
        extensible based on the agent implementation.

   application
        A network-based, high-level protocol performing useful work
        to an end-user of end-system.  Typically the application
        performs multiple request/response transactions to complete
        its work.  E.g., a web-application downloading a web page
        completes DNS, TCP-connect and multiple HTTP GET transactions
        prior to completing its task.

   transactions
        Elemental request/response transactions comprising more
        complex network-based applications.

5.2.  Report Aggregation

   This MIB provides functions to aggregate measurements into higher
   level summaries identical to the aggregation defined in the APM-MIB
   [APM]. In addition to temporal aggregation of data, the Textual Con-
   vention, TransactionAggregationType, is imported from the APM MIB,
   which specifies the nature of the spatial aggregation employed.


5.3.  Structure of the MIB

   The objects are arranged in the following groups:

       -- tpmCapabilitiesGroup

       -- tpmAggregateReportsGroup

       -- tpmCurrentReportsGroup

       -- tpmExceptionReportsGroup


   These groups are the basic unit of conformance.  If an agent imple-
   ments a group, then it must implement all objects in that group.
   While this section provides an overview of grouping and conformance
   information for this MIB, the authoritative reference for such infor-
   mation is contained in the MODULE-COMPLIANCE and OBJECT-GROUP macros
   later in this MIB.

   These groups are defined to provide a means of assigning object iden-
   tifiers, and to provide a method for implementers of managed agents
   to know which objects they must implement.

INTERNET DRAFT                   TPM MIB                   June 10, 2002


5.3.1. The tpmCapabilitiesGroup

   The tpmCapabilitiesGroup contains objects and tables which show the
   measurement protocol and metric capabilities of the agent. This group
   primarily consists of the tpmTransactionMetricDirTable and the tpm-
   MetricDefTable.

5.3.2. The tpmAggregateReportsGroup

   The tpmAggregateReportsGroup is used to provide the collection of
   aggregated statistical measurements for the configured report inter-
   vals. The tpmAggregateReportsGroup consists of the tpmAggrReportCn-
   trlTable and the tpmAggrReportTable.

5.3.3. The tpmCurrentReportsGroup

   The tpmCurrentReportsGroup is used to provide the collection of
   uncompleted measurements for the current configured report for those
   transactions caught in progress. A history of these transactions is
   also maintained once the current transaction has completed. The tpm-
   CurrentReportsGroup consists of the tpmCurrReportTable.

5.3.4. The tpmExceptionReportsGroup

   The tpmExceptionReportsGroup is used to link immediate notifications
   of transactions that exceed certain thresholds defined in the apmEx-
   ceptionGroup [APM]. This group reports the aggregated sub-application
   measurements for those applications exceeding thresholds.

5.4.  Statistics for Aggregation of Data - Conventions

   In order to measure the performance of traffic flows in a network,
   the proper analysis of a set of statistics is required.  Since a
   large majority of the statistics have a basis of time, the use of a
   simple statistical model is feasible.  Therefore, the MIB definitions
   within this document all use a basic set of statistical computed val-
   ues to assist in further analysis by a management application.

   The remaining subsections in this section detail the common struc-
   tured features the are applied to the performance metrics in the sta-
   tistical format described above.  The tpmMetricsDefTable (discussed
   below) describes the set of metrics supported in this MIB-set frame-
   work.

5.5.  Relationship to the Remote Monitoring MIB

   This document describes the implementation of an additional MIB for
   the support of performance related metrics within the framework of

   the RMON-2 MIB [RFC2021].  The objects and table defined in this MIB
   are an extension to the existing framework for the support of both
   Client/Server and Server push related applications and services.

5.6.  Relationship to RMON MIB Protocol Identifier Reference

   This document uses the Protocol Indentifiers outlined in the current
   Protocol Identifier Reference document, RFC 2074 [RFC2074].  The pro-
   tocol index values throughout the document are a direct reference to
   the same relationship that exists between the RMON-2 MIB [RFC2021]
   and the Protocol Identifier Reference document, RFC 2074 [RFC2074].
   An important extension of the Protocol Identification to application-
   level verbs is found in [APV].

5.7.  Relationship to Standards-Based Performance Metric References

   This document uses the tpmMetricsDefTable to describe the metrics
   supported by an instance of the TPM MIB.  The performance metric
   index values throughout the document are a direct reference to the
   metrics defined in that table.  The table define metrics by directly
   referencing other standards that provide definitive descriptions of
   the metric.

5.8.  Relationship to Application Performance Measurement MIB

   This document uses the apmReportControlIndex, appLocalIndex and apm-
   ReportIndex as outlined in the current Application Performance Mea-
   surement MIB draft document [APM].  These objects are used to create
   a reference link for the purpose of reporting transaction flow
   details on application level measurements.  As such, the TPM MIB is
   designed to provide a drill-down extension to the APM MIB. Further,
   it draws heavily on the ideas and designs laid out in the APM MIB.

6.  Statistics Perspective

   When dealing with time based measurements on application data packets
   it would be ideal if all the timestamps and related data could be
   stored and forwarded for later analysis.  However when faced with
   thousands of conversations per second on ever faster networks, stor-
   ing all the data, even if compressed, would take too much processing,
   memory, and manager download time to be practical.

   It is important to note that in dealing with network data we will be
   dealing with statistical populations and not samples.  Statistics
   books deal with both because the math is similar.  In collecting
   agent data a population, i.e. all the data, must be processed.
   Because of the nature of application protocols just sampling some of
   the packets will not give good results.  Missing just one critical

   packet, such as one that specified an ephemeral port on which data
   will be transmitted, or what application will be run, can cause much
   valid data to be lost.

   The time-based measurements the agent collects will come from examin-
   ing the entire group of data, i.e. the population. The population
   will be finite.  The agent will seek only to provide information that
   will describe the actual data. Analysis of that data will be left to
   the management station.

   The simplest form of representing a group of data is by frequency
   distributions, buckets. Statistics provides a great many ways of ana-
   lyzing this type of data and there are some rules in creating the
   buckets. First the range needs to be known. Second a bucket size
   needs to be determined. Fixed bucket sizes are best, while variable
   may be used if needed. However the statistics texts tend to only
   refer to operations of fixed size buckets. This method of describing
   data is expensive for a agent to implement. First the agent must pro-
   cess a great amount of data at a time. In storing the data, determine
   the range, then locating the buckets and then fill in the data after
   the fact takes a fair amount of storage and time. Fixing the range
   and bucket sizes in the beginning can be problematical as the agent
   may have to adjust the values for each of the applications it col-
   lects data on.  Such numbers can be in the thousands.  Additional
   complexity arises in adding new protocols and even in describing the
   buckets themselves to the management application. This is the
   approach taken in the APM MIB.

   A complimentary approach is to provide frequency distribution statis-
   tics. Frequency distribution statistics describes aggregation such as
   mean and standard deviation that can be obtained by summation func-
   tions on the individual data elements in a population.  Analysis of
   the data described by these functions has been greatly studied and
   interpretation of these values is available to anyone with an intro-
   duction to statistics.  In fact, frequency distributions are rou-
   tinely analyzed to generate these varied numbers which are then used
   for further analysis.  Also note that frequency distributions by
   their very nature provide an exact characterization of the data.
   Whereas buckets, will introduce error factors that are not present
   with direct analysis by a summation type formulas.  Because the TPM
   MIB provides a drill-down capability to the APM MIB is has to measure
   and store much more information than the APM MIB.  For this reason,
   and to compliment the APM MIB, the TPM MIB relies on statistical
   descriptions rather than a bucket description of the measurement
   data.

   The agent will provide data that can be used to calculate the most
   basic and useful statistical aggregates.  The agent will not perform

   the calculations and provide the statistical measurement directly.
   There are several reason why this is not desired. The first is that
   to find the final measurement can be expensive in terms of computa-
   tion and representation.  There are divisions and square roots and
   the measurements are expressed as floating point values.  The second
   is that by providing the variables to the statistical functions,
   those variables are scalable.  It is possible to combine smaller
   intervals into larger ones.

   An example is the arithmetic mean or average.  This is the sum of the
   data divided by the number of data elements.  The agent will provide
   the sum of the x and the number of elements N. The management station
   can perform the division to obtain the average.  Given two samples,
   they can be combined by adding the sum of the x's and by adding the
   number of elements to get a combined sum and number of elements.  The
   average formula then works just the same.  Also the sum of the x and
   the number of element variables are used in calculating other statis-
   tical measurement values as well.

6.1.  Statistics Structure

   The data statistical elements, datum, of the metric have been chosen
   to maximize the amount of data available while minimizing the amount
   of memory needed to store the statistic and minimizing the CPU pro-
   cessing requirement needed to generate the statistic.

   The statistic data structure contains five unsigned integer datum.

       N        count of the number of data points for the metric
       S(X)     sum of all the data point values for the metric
       S(X2)    sum of all the data point values squared for the metric
       Xmax     maximum data point value for the metric
       Xmin     minimum data point value  for the metric
       S(I*X)   sum of the datapoints multiplied by their order, i.e.,
                = SUM from i=1 to N { i*X sub i}

   A performance metric is used to describe events over a time interval.
   The measurement points can be processed immediately into the statis-
   tic and do not have to be stored for later processing.  For example
   to count the number of events in a time interval it is sufficient to
   increment a counter for each event, it is not necessary to cache all
   the events and then count them at the end of the interval. The
   statistic is also designed to be easily scalable in terms of combin-
   ing adjacent intervals.  For example if an agent created a specific
   statistic every 30 seconds and a user table interval was set to 60
   seconds, the 60 second statistic could be obtained by combining the
   two 30 second statistics.  The following rules will be applied when
   combining adjacent statistics.

                       statistics from the later 30 second period
                       and N is the count from the former 30 second
                       period.

   This structure gives a generic framework upon which the actual per-
   formance statistics will be defined.  Each specific statistical defi-
   nition must address the specific significance, if any, given to each
   of the metric datum.  While a specific metric definition should try
   to conform to the generic framework, it is acceptable for a metric
   datum to not be used, and to have no meaning, for a specific metric.
   In such cases the datum will default to a 0 value.

6.2.  Statistics Analysis

   The actual meaning of a specific statistical datum is determined by
   the definition of the specific statistic.  The following is a discus-
   sion of the operations and observations that can be performed on a
   generic metric.  This means that the following may or may not apply
   and/or have meaning when applied to any specific metric.

   The following observations and analysis techniques are not all inclu-
   sive.  Rather these are the ones we have come up with at the time of
   writing this document.

       + Number.

       + Frequency.

       + The time interval is the time interval specified in the control
       table.  It is not a metric datum, but it is associated with the
       metric sample.

       + Maximum

       + Minimum

       + Range

       + Arithmetic Mean

       + Root Mean Square

        The tpmAggrReportControlIndex value in the index identifies
        the tpmAggrReportCntrlEntry on whose behalf this entry was
        created.  The tpmCurrReportAppLocalIndex value in the

        reported.  The protocolDirLocalIndex value in the
        index identifies the network layer protocol
        of the tpmAggrReportServerAddress. When the associated
        tpmAggrReportCntrlAggregationType value is
        equal to applications(4), this value will equal 0.
        The tpmCurrReportServerAddress value in the
        index identifies the network layer address of the
        server in traffic flows aggregated in this entry.
        The tpmCurrReportCurrentApmNameClientID value in the
        index identifies the network layer address of the
        client in traffic flows aggregated in this entry.
        The tpmCurrReportCurrentMetricIndex value in the
        index identifies the transported application protocol
        of the traffic flows aggregated in this entry.

        Note that the order of protocolDirLocalIndex variables is
        the opposite of that in the RMON2 MIB (application.network
        instead of network.application) so that the report entries are
        sorted by application first, server second and client third.

        the tpmAggrReportCntrlEntry on whose behalf this entry was

11.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure envi-
   ronment without proper protection can have a negative effect on net-
   work operations.

   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
   sensitive information.

   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them
   over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features
   for such a secure environment.

   In order to implement this MIB, an agent must make certain management
   information available about protocols and network addresses used
   within a managed system, which may be considered sensitive in some
   network environments.

   Therefore, a network administrator may wish to employ instance-level
   access control, and configure the TPM MIB access (e.g., community
   strings in SNMPv1 and SNMPv2C), such that certain instances within
   this MIB (e.g., tpmReportMetricStatisticN), are excluded from partic-
   ular MIB views.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security fea-
   tures as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of
   the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly config-
   ured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users)
   that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/cre-
   ate/delete) them.
