Abstract

   The Martini Working Group is defining a mechanism for SIP IP-PBX type
   devices to REGISTER and obtain SIP service for E.164-based Address of
   Records.  In doing so it has selected a solution that is not
   compatible with the solution that was specified in ETSI TISPAN and
   3GPP for subscription based business trunking.  The latter solution
   not only covers E.164 numbers but also handles non-E.164 numbers and
   alphanumeric AOR's.

   This document defines a extension of the martini mechanism that
   allows it to be used also with ETSI TISPAN and 3GPP standard
   subscription based business trunking arrangements.

Internet-Draft          SIP MARTINI with FRIENDS              April 2010


1.  Introduction

   In many deployed SIP Service Provider (SSP) architectures, it is
   common to use REGISTER requests to provide the reachability
   information for IP-PBXs, instead of DNS-based resolution and routing.
   An IETF-defined mechanism for doing so is being worked on in the
   Martini Working Group, in [draft-gin].

   The actual end users that are served by the IP-PBX will most likely
   register themselves with the IP-PBX, if that IP-PBX is connecting end
   users using the SIP protocol.  This means that end users register
   with the IP-PBX so the IP-PBX knows where to reach them, additionally
   the IP-PBX will have registered with the SSP using a bulkcontact
   which allows the SSP to know where to reach end users that are
   assigned to that IP-PBX in the SSP systems.

   Taking one step back and considering the normal SIP arrangement
   without any IP-PBX, in this case the usual setup in which SIP is used
   is that any user's AOR would be handled by a proxy that is
   responsible for handling requests for the domain indicated by the
   hostport portion of the AOR.  Note that this does not imply
   exclusivity of this proxy instance as there may be a farm of
   cooperating proxies all handling requests for that same domain.  The
   users registered individual reachability information with the proxy
   instance assigned during registration, which would then route
   incoming requests accordingly.

   Fast forwarding again to the case where the IP-PBX provides
   reachability information to the SSP's proxy using a REGISTER request.
   The problem that martini is tasked to resolve is that current
   solutions like the one standardised by ETSI/3GPP or the ones
   specified by the SIP Forum lack an explicit indication during
   registration, this is reflected in the name of the work group
   "Multiple AoR reachabiliTy InformatioN Indication", a description can
   be found in [draft-ietf-martini-reqs].

   The current proposed Martini mechanism described in
   [draft-ietf-martini-gin] only supports E.164-based AoR's, however in
   actual deployments private-extension or "local" numbers are used for
   hosted and carrier-provided intra-Enterprise calling services, and
   domain-scoped alphanumeric URIs may become more popular in the near
   future.  Neither of these forms of AoRs are supported by the current
   Martini mechanism.

   Furthermore the current martini routing mechanism provides a solution
   that is not compatible with the solution that is standardised in ETSI
   TISPAN and 3GPP for subscription based business trunking.  That
   solution not only supports E.164 numbers but also handles non-E.164

   numbers and alphanumeric AOR's.

   The current martini mechanism described in [draft-ietf-martini-gin]
   is said to put less requirements on the SIP IP-PBX in terms of
   configuration and might therefore put less requirements on simple IP-
   PBX regarding configuration and be more appropriate in limited
   deployments where there is no need for addressing users beyond
   traditional E.164 numbers.  That might well be, but it also is only
   representing a small fraction of the market as it ignores the only
   service provider standard available today.

   This document therefore proposes a way forward whereby two modes of
   operation can be signalled independently, in a manner consistent with
   (RFC3261 [RFC3261]).

   ETSI TISPAN defines Next Generation Networks (NGN) which uses the
   3rd-Generqation Partnership Project (3GPP) IMS (IP Multimedia
   Subsystem) which in turn uses SIP (RFC3261 [RFC3261]) as its main
   signalling protocol.  (For more information on the IMS, a detailed
   description can be found in 3GPP TS 23.228 [3GPP.23.228] and 3GPP TS
   24.229 [3GPP.24.229].)


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].


3.  Definitions

3.1.  AOR

   address-of-record, as defined by RFC 3261: a URI by which the user is
   canonically known (e.g., on their business cards, in the From header
   field of their requests, in the To header field of REGISTER requests,
   etc.).

3.2.  Alphanumeric SIP URI

   a SIP AoR which does not identify a global E.164 number or local-
   number.

Internet-Draft          SIP MARTINI with FRIENDS              April 2010


3.3.  Implicit Registration

   implicitly providing the reachability information for something other
   than the AoR explicitly indicated in the Register transaction.

3.4.  Reachability Information

   a set of URI's identifying the host and path of Proxies to reach that
   host; like any URI, these URI's may identify the specific connection
   transport, IP Address, and port information, or they may only
   identify FQDN's.

3.5.  SSP

   SIP Service Provider, as defined by [RFC5486].

3.6.  BC

   bulk contact, a contact address that is used as a reachability
   address for multiple AOR.

3.7.  domain federation

   Domain federation constitutes an architecture whereby SSP and the
   enterprise owning a PBX connected to the SSP's network, together
   manage a specific domain.


4.  Overview of the FRIENDS solution

4.1.  The issue in short

   The current martini solution based on the GIN draft solves only a
   subspace of the total SIP trunking problemspace.  It does so by
   staying carefully within the boundaries of what can be made to work
   with simple SIP proxies, taking for granted that the solution is
   suboptimal when more complicated deployments need to be served
   involving private numberplans, alphanumeric naming schemes etc.

   It chooses a solution where Request-URI is rewritten with the PBX-
   contact for routing as is also done normally on the last hop to the
   UAS, this means that such Request-URI rewriting is also imposed on
   the intermediary hop between the SSP and the SIP IP-PBX.  It has been
   recognised in earlier discussions that this is in fact an error in
   SIP to use Request-URI rewriting for request routing.  In fact
   RFC3261 already introduced a mechanism to overcome this on
   intermediary hops for which it provides the Route header field.  The
   Route header field is part of the core routing mechanism of SIP

Internet-Draft          SIP MARTINI with FRIENDS              April 2010


   RFC3261 compliant proxies.

   Other standards have been developed (especially ETSI TISPAN TS 182
   025 and related work in 3GPP 24229) to serve such more complicated
   scenarios, the solution is build on placing the PBX-contact in the
   Route header field and leaving the Request-URI unchanged.  There
   exist on the market place already a number of IP-PBX that expect the
   AOR in the Request-URI and its own contact address in the Route
   header field.

   Both mechanisms have their area of applicability and are superior in
   their respective application niches.

   Building on these facts the conclusion must be that it would be
   beneficial to combine both mechanisms and allow both routing variants
   to be supported.

4.2.  Registration signalling

   This document extends the martini mechanism by distinguishing basic
   and federated bulk contact routing.

   A PBX can announce that it supports basic bulk contact routing, by
   registering with bulk contact parameter set to the value "basic" in
   the registered contact.

   A PBX can announce that it supports federated bulk contact routing,
   by registering with bulk contact parameter set to the value
   "federated" in the registered contact.

   A PBX can announce that it supports both basic and federated bulk
   contact routing, by including two occurrences of the bulk contact
   parameter in the register request.

   A PBX that supports basic bulk contact routing, supports and
   understands Request-URI's resulting from the current GIN model.  This
   is good for simple PBX's or undemanding non-IMS deployments and it
   works great with numbers.

   A PBX that supports federated bulk contact routing can handle cases
   where the enterprise domain to which the PBX belongs is federated
   with the SSP.  And hence it is OK to be treated as a next hop proxy
   and receive the PBX-contact on the Route header field and a Request-
   URI where the hostpart portion contains the federated domain name.
   The latter allows delivery of the AOR in the Request-URI to the IP-
   PBX.

   Upon receipt of a register request the SSP determines whether bulk

Internet-Draft          SIP MARTINI with FRIENDS              April 2010


   contact routing applies and which variant to use based on the
   presence of the bulk contact parameter in the registration.

4.3.  SSP Processing of Inbound Requests targeted at an implicitly
      registered AOR assigned to a bulk contact

   When a request enters the SSP that belongs to an implicitly
   registered AOR assigned to a bulk contact the SSP's proxy checks
   whether the bulk contact registered for basic or federated bulk
   contact routing.

   If the bulk contact parameter indicated support for basic bulk
   contact routing or if the bulk contact was absent but the provisioned
   bulk contact indicator indicated support for basic bulk contact
   routing the SSP proxy proceeds with behaviour as specified in
   [draft-ietf-martini-gin-01].

   If the bulk contact parameter indicated support for federated bulk
   contact routing or if the bulk contact parameter was absent but the
   provisioned bulk contact indicator indicated support for federated
   bulk contact routing, then the SSP proxy will proceed by placing the
   registered PBX-contact at the end of the Route header field and leave
   the Request-URI unchanged.

   The above behaviour makes sure that federated routing is only used in
   cases where it is certain that the SSP configured its system
   knowingly to perform that behaviour for a certain customer.  He will
   make sure that both sides are configured properly.  This addresses
   the issues that people raised with solutions based on placing the
   contact on the Route header field in terms of problems with domain
   ownership.
