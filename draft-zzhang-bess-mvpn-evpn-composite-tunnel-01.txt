                       MVPN/EVPN Composite Tunnel
            draft-zzhang-bess-mvpn-evpn-composite-tunnel-01

Abstract

   EVPN E-Tree defines a composite tunnel to be used for a Root PE to
   simultaneously indicate a non-Ingress-Replication tunnel (e.g., P2MP
   tunnel) in the transmit direction and an Ingress Replication tunnel
   in the receive direction for BUM traffic.  This document extends it
   to more generic use in both MVPN and general EVPN.

1.  Terminologies

   Familiarity with BIER/MVPN/EVPN protocols and procedures is assumed.
   Some terminologies are listed below for convenience.

   [To be added].

2.  Introduction

   The composite tunnel defined in [RFC8317] is specifically designed
   for the particular use case of EVPN E-Tree in that the Root PE only
   needs to receive on the Ingress Replication (IR) tunnel and transmit
   on the non-IR tunnel encoded in the PMSI Tunnel Attribute (PTA) that
   specifies a Composite Tunnel, hence the following language quoted
   from [RFC8317]:

Internet-Draft              composite-tunnel                October 2019


     Composite tunnel type is advertised by the Root PE to
     simultaneously indicate a non-Ingress-Replication tunnel (e.g., P2MP
     tunnel) in the transmit direction and an Ingress Replication tunnel
     in the receive direction for the BUM traffic.

   However, the underlying principal of MVPN PMSI A-D route, EVPN IMET
   route and the PTA that the routes carry allows the composite tunnel
   to be used in more generic use cases for both MVPN and EVPN, as
   explained in Section 2.1 and Section 2.2.

   The EVPN IMET route is the equivalent of MVPN I-PMSI A-D route.  In
   the rest of the document, unless explicitly stated, I-PMSI A-D route
   refers to MVPN Intra-AS I-PMSI A-D route and/or EVPN IMET route.

2.1.  P2MP Tunnels

   As specified in [RFC6514] [RFC7432], an I-PMSI A-D route advertises a
   PE's membership in a VPN or Broadcast Domain (BD).  The route carries
   a PTA, whose Tunnel Identifier field specifies the tunnel that the
   advertising PE uses to send traffic unless the tunnel type is either
   "No tunnel information present" or "Ingress Replication".  A PE that
   imports the route into a VRF/BD/EVI will join the specified tunnel if
   it needs to receive traffic from the advertising PE.

   As specified in [RFC6514] and clarified in [RFC7988], if the tunnel
   type is Ingress Replication, and the Leaf Information Required (LIR)
   bit in the PTA's Flags field is set to 0, the advertising PE is
   actually not indicating that it uses IR to send traffic, but that it
   will receive traffic using the label that is part of the Tunnel
   Identifier field of the PTA.  A PTA with tunnel type set to IR and
   LIR bit set to 1 does indicate that the advertising router will use
   IR to send traffic.  In that case, the label field in the Tunnel
   Identifier is set to 0 and receiving PEs will need to send a Leaf A-D
   route to "join" the IR tunnel.  The label value in the Tunnel
   Identifier of the Leaf A-D route's PTA is used when sending traffic
   to the advertiser of the Leaf A-D route.

   While [RFC7988] is MVPN specific, the above IR procedures and
   clarifications are also applicable to EVPN, as the EVPN IMET route is
   the equivalent of an I-PMSI A-D route with the LIR flag set to 0.

   In summary, w/o considering composite tunnel, when IR is specified in
   I-PMSI A-D routes w/ the LIR bit NOT set, the tunnel is used to
   receive traffic (even from PEs not advertising IR in its PMSI A-D
   routes).  The composite tunnel introduced in [RFC8317] combines a
   transmitting non-IR tunnel and a receiving IR tunnel, but a PE
   advertising a composite tunnel should be still be able to send to
   certain PEs using IR.

2.2.  MP2MP Tunnels

   When the PTA specifies one of the MP2MP tunnels (BIDIR-PIM, mLDP
   MP2MP, BIER), it means the advertising PE will use the MP2MP tunnel
   for both sending and receiving.  While [RFC8317] specifies composite
   tunnel only as transmitting non-IR + receiving IR, an MP2MP tunnel
   can also be part of composite tunnel to receive traffic.  The rest of
   the document focuses on BIER, but it equally applies to mLDP MP2MP or
   BIDIR-PIM.

3.  Specifications

   While not previously done so, this document makes it explicit that,
   an MVPN/EVPN PE1 advertising a non-IR tunnel can also send to another
   PE2 using IR if PE2 advertises to receive traffic with IR (whether
   PE2 advertises IR standalone or as part of a composite tunnel), as
   long as it is known that PE2 will receive from PE1 the same data only
   via IR.

3.1.  General MVPN/EVPN Use of Composite Tunnels

   This document extends the use of composite tunnel to appropriate
   general MVPN/EVPN scenarios where a PE advertises a composite tunnel
   in its I-PMSI A-D route to receive traffic on IR tunnel and send
   traffic on non-IR tunnel.

   This document also allows an MP2MP tunnel to be part of a composite
   tunnel so that the advertising PE can use both the MP2MP tunnel and
   IR to receive traffic.

   For a regular, non-composite tunnel in the PMSI Tunnel Attribute
   (PTA) of a PMSI/Leaf A-D route, the PTA includes an "MPLS Label"
   field between the "Tunnel Type" field and the "Tunnel Identifier"
   field.  The label is for "tunnel aggregation" purpose - traffic on
   the same tunnel could carry different labels for multiplexing purpose
   (e.g.  for different VPNs/BDs).  For an IR tunnel, the label is
   downstream- assigned; for non-IR tunnels, the label is either 0 (no
   aggregation) or upstream-assigned, or from a Domain-wide Common Block
   (DCB) [I-D.ietf-bess-mvpn-evpn-aggregation-label].

   [RFC8317] specifies that the "Tunnel Identifier" field includes a
   three-octet label before the actual identifier of the non-IR tunnel,
   though the text/diagram about the roles of the labels is unclear/
   confusing.  For easier reference this document moves the added label
   out, so that the "Tunnel Identifier" is the actual identifier of the
   non-IR tunnel:

                  +-------------------------------------------+

                 PTA Fields for Composite Tunnel [This Document]

   An example of composite tunnel is BIER-IR tunnel, where the tunnel
   type is set to 0x8B, and BIER Tunnel Aggregation Label and BIER
   Tunnel Identifier are as specified in [I-D.ietf-bier-mvpn].

   Section Section 4.1 gives an example application of using BIER-IR
   tunnel for BIER capable EVPN PEs to send/receive BUM traffic via
   BIER, and receive BUM traffic from BIER incapable PEs via IR; BIER
   incapable PEs send BUM traffic using IR; BIER traffic from BIER
   capable PEs will have the BIER header popped off by a Penultimate Hop
   before reaching BIER incapable PEs [I-D.ietf-bier-php].  The same can
   be used for MVPN as well.

3.2.  EVPN-IP Assisted Replication with BIER-IR Composite Tunnel

   For the example in Section Section 4.1, instead of having BIER
   incapable PEs send BUM traffic using IR to every PE, Assisted
   Replication (AR) [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-optimized-ir] can be used for a
   BIER incapable PE to send BUM traffic to a BIER capable Assisted
   Replication Replicator (AR-R) via IR, who will then relay to other
   PEs via BIER.

   The same concept applies to MVPN as well, though AR for MVPN is via
   Virtual Hub and Spoke (VHS) [RFC7024], similar to AR for EVPN-MPLS
   [I-D.keyupate-bess-evpn-virtual-hub]
   ([I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-optimized-ir] is for EVPN-IP).  The procedures
   for those two cases will be specified in separate documents.

   EVPN-IP AR with BIER-IR composite tunnels follows similar procedures
   as in [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-optimized-ir], with the following
   differences:

   o  The IMET route from a BIER capable AR-Replicator that has the IR-
      IP address in the Originating PE field encodes BIER tunnel in the
      PTA, as specified in [EVPN-BIER].

   o  An AR-Leaf originates an IMET route with BIER-IR tunnel with AR-
      Leaf flag.  If it is BIER capable, it both sends and receives BM
      traffic via BIER.  If it is not BIER capable, it sends BM traffic
      via IR to the AR-Replicator, who will then relay to other PEs
      using BIER.

   o  The AR-R does NOT relay traffic that arrive with BIER
      encapsulation.

   o  Only non-selective mode is supported.

   The above rules are illustrated in further details in
   Section Section 4.2.  Notice that, composite-tunnel is used because
   [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-optimized-ir] requires falling back to IR when
   the AR-Replicator is not available.

4.  Use-cases

   This section describes some Composite Tunnel use-cases.  We refer to
   BIER-IR as the PTA's Tunnel Type with the high-order bit set and BIER
   type, I.e., Tunnel Type = 0x8B, as per [RFC8317].  In this section, a
   BIER non-capable PE is assumed to be a PE that does not support BIER
   tunnel data plane transmission or termination.  However, these BIER
   non-capable PEs support the required control plane extensions to
   advertise BIER tunnel information in the IMET PTAs.

4.1.  BIER-IR Composite Tunnels in EVPN Networks

   BIER-IR composite tunnels may be used in a group of PEs attached to
   the same EVPN tenant network.  This would allow some of those PEs to
   use BIER P-tunnels where other PEs in the same group may use Ingress
   Replication (IR).  While these BIER-IR composite tunnels can be used
   in a similar use case as described in [RFC8317], they can also be
   used along with PHP as a way to introduce BIER in EVPN networks where
   some of the PEs do not support BIER data plane.

   Figure 1 illustrates an example of an EVPN BD where the PE1 and PE2
   support BIER data plane, but PE3/PE4/PE5 do not.  The network could
   still benefit of BIER if the BFRs connected to the receiver PEs (BFR1
   and BFR2), either directly or through a tunnel, pop the BIER header
   and send the EVPN payload natively to PE3/PE4/PE5, as described in
   [I-D.ietf-bier-php].

   o  All the PEs advertise an IMET route containing a BIER-IR composite
      tunnel in the PTA (PMSI Tunnel Attribute):

      *  The Tunnel Type has a value of 0x8B (BIER-IR composite tunnel).

      *  The BIER Tunnel Identifier (composed Sub-Domain ID, BFR-ID and
         BFR-Prefix) and Flags are populated as in [EVPN-BIER].  The IR
         Label is a downstream allocated Label that allows remote PEs to
         send BUM traffic to the advertising PE using Ingress
         Replication, as in [RFC8317].

   o  When PE1/PE2 need to transmit BUM packets, they follow the
      procedures in [EVPN-BIER].  BUM packets received on PE1/PE2 from
      other BIER capable PEs will be received with a BIER encapsulation
      and procedures in [EVPN-BIER] will be followed.  PHP nodes pop the
      BIER header before delivering the EVPN packets to PE3/PE4/PE5.

   o  When PE3/PE4/PE5 need to send BUM packets to each other or to PE1/
      PE2, they use Ingress Replication and the IR label that is
      received from the other PEs as part of the composite tunnel Tunnel
      Identifier.

4.2.  Assisted Replication and BIER Composite Tunnels

   The use case in section Section 4.1 allows the introduction of BIER
   in EVPN tenant networks where BIER capable and BIER non-capable PEs
   are attached to the same EVPN tenant network.  However, BIER non-
   capable PEs still send multiple copies of the same BUM packet to
   reach the other PEs.

   In overlay networks, the use case can be optimized so that the BIER
   non-capable PEs send a single copy per packet by using Assisted
   Replication along with BIER-IR composite tunnels.  Figure 2
   illustrates this use case with an example, where AR-L1/AR-L2/AR-L3
   and AR-L4 are Assisted Replication Leaf routers [AR] that do not
   support BIER data plane.  AR-R1/AR-R2 are Non-Selective Assisted
   Replication Replicators [AR] that do support BIER data plane and are
   connected to other BFRs, such as BFR1 and BFR2.

                  Figure 2 - BIER-IR Composite Tunnels and AR

   In this example:

   o  The AR-R PEs issue two IMET routes each:

      *  An IMET route that includes the AR-IP in the Originating PE,
         Tunnel Type AR, IR label, Flags Type = 01 (AR-Replicator) and L
         = 0 (no Leaf Information Required).  The IR Label is a
         downstream allocated Label that will be used by the AR-L PEs
         that transmit BUM traffic to the receiving AR-R for replication
         to remote AR-L PEs.  No change with respect to [AR].

      *  And an IMET route that includes the IR-IP in the Originating PE
         field, Tunnel Type and Tunnel Identifier with BIER information,
         as in [EVPN-BIER].

   o  Each AR-L PE issues an IMET route with:

      *  The Flags field populated as in [AR] with AR Type set to AR-
         LEAF.

      *  The Tunnel Type and Tunnel Identifier have composite BIER-IR
         information, as in Section Section 4.1.  The IR Label is a
         downstream allocated Label that will be used by the remote AR-L
         PEs when IR is used for unknown unicast traffic.  The MPLS
         Label field in the PTA MAY be zero.

   When an AR-R receives a BM packet encapsulated in an overlay tunnel,
   it will do a tunnel destination IP lookup and if the destination IP
   is the AR-R IR-IP Address, the AR-R will proceed as in [AR].  If the
   destination IP is the AR-R AR-IP Address, the AR-R MUST forward the
   packet to the BIER network and any local AC (if any).  When creating
   the BIER header, the AR-R will behave as a BFIR and will include all
   the remote AR-L and AR-R in the BIER header, excluding the AR-L from
   which the BM packet was received.

   If an AR-R receives a BM packet encapsulated in BIER, it will follow
   the procedures in [EVPN-BIER] as any other BIER PE.  It MUST NOT send
   the BM packets to any overlay tunnels, only to local ACs.

   In the example of Figure 2, when AR-R1 receives a BM packet from
   AR-L1 in an overlay tunnel with its AR-IP as tunnel destination
   address, it will forward the packet encapsulated with a BIER header
   that includes AR-L2, AR-L3 and AR-L4 as BFERs, but not AR-L1.

   As in [AR], if the AR-L does not discover any AR-R in the service, it
   MUST use IR to send BM traffic to the remote AR-L PEs and AR-R PEs
   with local ACs.  If there is one or more AR-Rs (discovered by
   tracking the received AR-R routes) the AR-L selects a AR-R to send
   the BM traffic to.  The selection rules are described in [AR].  The
   AR-L encapsulates the BM packets into an overlay tunnel that uses the
   AR-IP and AR Label advertised by the selected AR-R.  In the example
   of Figure 2, AR-L1 selects AR-R1 as the AR-R.  If AR-R1 becomes
   unavailable, AR-R2 is selected.  If no AR-R is available, AR-L1 would
   use IR to send the BM packets to the remote AR-L PEs.

   AR-L PEs receive the BUM packets without a BIER header (since it is
   popped by the PHP node) and with the MPLS Label / VNI imposed by the
   AR-R (or the source AR-L if there is no AR for the packet).
