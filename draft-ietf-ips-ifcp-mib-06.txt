Abstract 
    
   The iFCP protocol provides Fibre Channel fabric functionality on an 
   IP network in which TCP/IP switching and routing elements replace 
   Fibre Channel components.  The iFCP protocol is used between iFCP 
   Gateways.  This draft provides a mechanism to monitor and control 
   iFCP Gateway instances, and their associated sessions, using SNMP. 
    
   This memo is a product of the IP Storage (IPS) working group within 
   the Internet Engineering Task Force.  Comments are solicited and

1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework 
    
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of 
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
    
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally 
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the 
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a 
   MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 
   58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 
   2580 [RFC2580]. 
    
2.  Introduction 
    
   The iFCP protocol can be used by FC to IP based storage gateways for 
   FCP storage interconnects.  Figure 1 provides an example 
   interconnect between iFCP gateways.

   The iFCP MIB Module is designed to allow SNMP to be used to monitor 
   and manage local iFCP gateway instances, including the configuration 
   of iFCP sessions between gateways.

3.  Technical Description 
    
   The iFCP MIB Module is divided into sections for iFCP local gateway 
   instance management, iFCP session management, and iFCP session 
   statistics. 
    
   The section for iFCP gateway management provides default settings 
   and information about each local instance.  A single management 
   entity can monitor multiple local gateway instances.  Each local 
   gateway is conceptually an independent gateway that has both Fibre 
   Channel and IP interfaces.  The default IP Time Out Value (IP_TOV) 
   is configurable for each gateway.  Other standard MIBs, such as the 
   Fibre Management MIB [FCMGT01] or Interfaces Group MIB [RFC2863], 
   can be used to manage non-iFCP specific gateway parameters.  The 
   local gateway instance section provides iFCP specific information as 
   well as optional links to other standard management MIBs. 
    
   The iFCP session management section provides information on iFCP 
   sessions that are using one of the local iFCP gateway instances.  
   This section allows the management of specific iFCP parameters, 
   including changing the IP_TOV from the default setting of the 
   gateway. 
    
   The iFCP session statistics section provides statistical information 
   on the iFCP sessions that are using one of the local iFCP gateways.  
   These tables augment the session management table.  Additional 
   statistical information for an iFCP gateway or session, that is not 
   iFCP specific, can be obtained using other standard MIBs.  The iFCP 
   statistics are provided in both standard and low-capacity 
   (counter32) methods.

5.  IANA Considerations 
    
   IANA is requested to make a unique MIB OID assignment under the 
   transmission branch. 
    
6.  Security Considerations 
    
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module 
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such 
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
   network operations. 
    
   Changing the following object values, with a MAX-ACCESS of read-
   write, may cause disruption in storage traffic: 
        ifcpLclGtwyInstAddrTransMode 
        ifcpLclGtwyInstFcBrdcstSupport 
        ifcpLclGtwyInstDefaultIpTOV 
        ifcpLclGtwyInstDefaultLTInterval 
        ifcpSessionIpTOV 
    
   Changing the following object value, with a MAX-ACCESS of read-
   write, may cause a user to lose track of the iFCP gateway:  
        ifcpLclGtwyInstDescr 
    
   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with 
   a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive 
   or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to 
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly 
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over 
   the network via SNMP. 
    
   The following object tables provide information about storage 
   traffic sessions, and can indicate to a user who is communicating 
   and exchanging storage data: 
        ifcpLclGtwyInstTable 
        ifcpSessionAttributesTable 
    
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.  
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), 
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is 
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the 
   objects in this MIB module. 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features 
   as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), 
   including full support for SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for 
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to 
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate 
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
