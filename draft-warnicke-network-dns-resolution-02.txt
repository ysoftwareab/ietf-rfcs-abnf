Abstract

   This document suggests a method of using the DNS to determine the
   network that contains a specified IP address, the netmask of that
   network, and the address(es) of first-hop routers(s) on that
   network.  This method supports variable length subnet masks,
   delegation of subnets on non-octet boundaries, and multiple routers
   per subnet.

1. Introduction

   As a variety of new devices are introduced to the network, many of
   them not traditional workstations or routers, there are requirements
   that the first-hop router provide some network service for a
   host.  It would be useful to have a standard mechanism for such
   a host to find the first-hop router(s).

   DNS-based mechanisms have been defined for the resolution of router
   addresses for classful networks (RFC 1035 [1]) and of subnets (RFC
   1101 [2]).  RFC 1101 suffers from a number of defects, chief among
   which are that it does not support variable length subnet masks,
   which are commonly deployed in the Internet.  The present document
   defines DNS-based mechanisms to cure these defects.

   Since the writing of RFC 1101, DNS mechanisms for dealing with
   classless networks have been defined, for example RFC 2317 [3].
   This document describes a mechanism that uses notation similar to
   that of RFC 2317 to specify a series of PTR records enumerating the
   subnets of a given network in the RFC 2317 notation.  This lookup
   process continues until the contents of the PTR records are not an
   in-addr.arpa.-derived domain name.  These terminal PTR record
   values are treated as the hostname(s) of the router(s) on that
   network.  This RFC also specifies an extension to the method of RFC
   2317 to support delegation at non-octet boundaries.

2. Generic format of a network domain name

   Using the Augmented BNF of RFC 2234 [4] we can describe a generic
   domain name for a network as follows:

   networkdomainname = maskedoctet "." *( decimaloctet / maskedoctet ".")
                        ".in-addr.arpa."

   maskedoctet = decimaloctet "-" mask

   mask = (*1( "1" / "2" ) DIGIT ) / "3" ("1" / "2" )

   decimaloctet = ( *1("1") DIGIT DIGIT ) /
                   ( "2" ( "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" ) DIGIT ) /
                   ( "2" "5" ( "1" / "2" /"3" / "4" / "5" ) )

   By way of reference, an IPv4 CIDR notation network address would
   be written

      IPv4CIDR = decimaloctet "." decimaloctet "." decimaloctet "."
      decimaloctet "/" mask

   A "-" is used as a delimiter in a maskedoctet instead of a "/" as in
   RFC 2317 out of concern about compatibility with existing DNS
   servers, many of which do not consider "/" to be a valid character in
   a hostname.

3. Non-octet boundary delegation

   In RFC 2317 there is no mechanism for non-octet boundary delegation.
   Networks would be represented as being part of the domain of the next
   octet.

   Examples:

      10.100.2.0/26  -> 0-26.2.100.10.in-addr.arpa.

      10.20.128.0/23 -> 128-23.20.10.in-addr.arpa.

      10.192.0.0/13 -> 192-13.10.in-addr.arpa.

   In the event that the entity subnetting does not actually own the
   network being subnetted on an octet break, a mechanism needs to be
   available to allow for the specification of those subnets.  The
   mechanism is to allow the use of maskedoctet labels as delegation
   shims.

   For example, consider an entity A which controls a network
   10.1.0.0/16.  Entity A delegates to entity B the network 10.1.0.0/18.
   In order to avoid having to update entries for entity B whenever
   entity B updates subnetting, entity A delegates the
   0-18.1.10.in-addr.arpa domain ( with an NS record in A's DNS tables
   as usual ) to entity B.  Entity B then subnets off 10.1.0.0/25.  It
   would provide a domain name for this network of
   0-25.0.0-18.1.10.in-addr.arpa ( in B's DNS tables).

   In order to speak about the non-octet boundary case more easily it is
   useful to define a few terms.

   Network domain names which do not contain any maskedoctets after the
   first ( leftmost ) label are hereafter referred to as canonical
   domain names for that network.  0-25.0.1.10.in-addr.arpa.  is the
   canonical domain name for the network 10.1.0.0/25.

   Network domain names which do contain maskedoctet labels after the
   first ( leftmost ) label can be reduced to a canonical domain name by
   dropping all maskedoctet labels after the first ( leftmost ) label.
   They are said to be reducible to the canonical network domain name.
   So for example 0-25.0.0-18.1.10.in-addr.arpa.  is reducible to
   0-25.0.1.10.in-addr.arpa.  Note that a  network domain name
   represents the same network as the canonical domain name to which it
   can be reduced.

4. Lookup procedure for a network given an IP address

4.1 Procedure

   1.  Take the initial IP address x.y.z.w and create a candidate
       network by assuming a 24 bit subnet mask.  Thus the initial
       candidate network is x.y.z.0/24.

   2.  Given a candidate network of the form x.y.z.n/m create an
       in-addr.arpa candidate domain name:

       1.  If the number of mask bits m is greater than or equal to 24
           but less than or equal to 32 then the candidate domain name
           is n-m.z.y.x.in-addr.arpa.

       2.  If the number of mask bits m is greater than or equal to 16
           but less than 24 then the candidate domain name is
           z-m.y.x.in-addr.arpa.

       3.  If the number of mask bits m is greater than or equal to 8
           but less than 16 then the candidate domain name is
           y-m.x.in-addr.arpa.

       4.  The notion of fewer than 8 mask bits is not reasonable.

   3.  Perform a DNS lookup for a PTR record for the candidate domain
       name.

   4.  If the PTR records returned from looking up the candidate domain
       name  are of the form of a domain name for a network as defined
       previously (Section 2), then for each PTR record reduce that
       returned domain name to the canonical form
       p1-q1.z1.y1.x1.in-addr.arpa.  This represents a network
       x1.y1.z.1.p1/q1.

       1.  If one of the x1.y1.z1.p1/q1 subnets contains the original IP
           address x.y.z.w then the PTR record return becomes the new
           candidate domain name.  Repeat steps 3-4.

       2.  If none of the x1.y1.z1.p1/q1 subnets contain the original IP
           address x.y.z.w then this process has failed.

   5.  If the PTR record(s) for the candidate network is not of the form
       of a network domain name then they are presumed to be the
       hostname(s) of the gateway(s) for the subnet being resolved.

   6.  If the PTR lookup fails ( no PTR  records are returned )

Internet-Draft    DNS Resolution of Networks and Gateways      June 2003


       1.  If no candidate network PTR lookup for this IP address has
           succeeded in the past and the netmask for the last candidate
           network was 24 or 16 bits long then presume a netmask of 8
           fewer bits for the candidate network and repeat steps 2-4.

       2.  If no candidate network PTR lookup for this IP address has
           succeeded in the past and the netmask for the last candidate
           network was not 24 of 16 bits long, then increase the netmask
           by 1 bit and repeat steps 2-4.

       3.  If a candidate network PTR lookup for this IP address has
           succeeded in the past or the netmask of the last candidate
           network was 32 bits then this process has failed.

   7.  Perform a DNS A record lookup for the domain name of the gateway
       to determine the IP number of the gateway.


4.2 Example

   Imagine we begin with the IP number 10.15.162.3.

   1.   Form a candidate network of 10.15.162.0/24.

   2.   Form a domain name 0-24.162.15.10.in-addr.arpa.

   3.   Lookup the PTR records for 0-24.162.15.10.in-addr.arpa.

   4.   Suppose the lookup fails ( no PTR records returned ), then

   5.   Form a new candidate network 10.15.0.0/16.

   6.   Form a domain name 0-16.15.10.in-addr.arpa.

   7.   Lookup the PTR records for 0-16.15.10.in-addr.arpa.

   8.   Lookup returns:

        1.  0-17.15.10.in-addr.arpa.

        2.  128-18.15.10.in-addr.arpa.

        3.  192-18.15.10.in-addr.arpa.

   9.   So 10.15.0.0/16 is subnetted into 10.15.0.0/17, 10.15.128.0/18,
        and 10.15.192.0/18.

   10.  Since 10.15.162.3 is in 10.15.128.0/18, the new candidate domain

        name is 128-18.15.10.in-addr.arpa.

   11.  Lookup the PTR records for 128-18.15.10.in-addr.arpa.

   12.  Lookup returns

        1.  128-19.128-18.15.10.in-addr.arpa.

        2.  0-25.160.128-18.15.10.in-addr.arpa.

        3.  128-25.160.128-18.15.10.in-addr.arpa.

        4.  0-24.161.128-18.15.10.in-addr.arpa.

        5.  162-23.128-18.15.10.in-addr.arpa.

   13.  The canonical network domains for these returned records are

        1.  128-19.15.10.in-addr.arpa.

        2.  0-25.160.15.10.in-addr.arpa.

        3.  128-25.160.15.10.in-addr.arpa.

        4.  0-24.161.15.10.in-addr.arpa.

        5.  162-23.15.10.in-addr.arpa.

   14.  So the network 10.15.128.0/18 is subnetted into 10.15.128.0/19,
        10.15.160.0/25, 10.15.160.128/25, 10.15.161.0/25, 10.15.162.0/
        23.

   15.  Since 10.15.162.3 is in 10.15.162.0/23 the new candidate domain
        name is 162-23.128-18.15.10.in-addr.arpa.

   16.  Lookup the PTR records for 162-23.128-18.15.10.in-addr.arpa.

   17.  Lookup returns:

        1.  gw1.example.com.

        2.  gw2.example.com.

   18.  Lookup the A records for gw1.example.com.  and gw2.example.com.

   19.  Lookup returns

        1.  gw1.example.com: 10.15.162.1

        2.  gw2.example.com: 10.15.162.2

   10.15.162.1 and 10.15.162.2.

   0-16.15.10.in-addr.arpa.  IN  PTR 192-18.15.10.in-addr.arpa.

   ;; delegate a shim zone for each of the subnets

   0-17.15.10.in-addr.arpa.    IN  NS 10.15.0.50

   128-18.15.10.in-addr.arpa.  IN  NS 10.15.128.50

6. Security Considerations

   Any revelation of information to the public internet about the
   internal structure of your network may make it easier for nefarious
   persons to mount diverse attacks upon a network.  Consequently, care
   should be exercised in deciding which ( if any ) of the DNS resource
   records described in this draft should be made visible to the public
   Internet.
