Internet-Draft       RFC 4360 Clarification Request         October 2009


1.  Introduction

   This draft describes a request for clarification of the Operations
   Section of [RFC4360], regarding the handling of non-transitive
   extended communities.

   While interpreting the Section 6 of [RFC4360], an implementation may
   handle non-transitive extended communities over eBGP sessions in a
   way preventing neighboring ASes to practically use non-transitive
   extended communities between each other.  Such implementations
   restrict the benefits of non-transitive communities to internal uses
   only, which looks unfortunate.

   Section 2 describes the request for clarification and Section 4
   suggests some changes to RFC 4360 that would help in precising
   desired handling of non-transitive extended communities.  Section 3
   describes what behavior we observed by running tests on various
   implementations.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Request

   As of RFC 4360, "If a route has a non-transitive extended community,
   then before advertising the route across the Autonomous System
   boundary the community SHOULD be removed from the route."

   This statement is unclear regarding two aspects of the handling of
   such non-transitive communities over eBGP sessions.

   First, it is unclear whether a BGP speaker setting / adding a non-
   transitive extended community on the outbound policy of an eBGP
   session is compliant with the RFC 4360 (Clarification A).

   Second, it is unclear whether a BGP speaker supporting RFC 4360 is
   allowed to enforce the removal of a non-transitive community in a
   path received over an eBGP session (Clarification B).


3.  Observed behaviors

   Different behaviors can be observed on recent implementations from
   different vendors.

   Some implementations remove any non-transitive extended communities

   from paths received over eBGP sessions, hence disallowing
   applications of non-transitive extended communities over eBGP
   sessions.

   Other implementations ignore non-transitivity and propagate non-
   transitive communities over eBGP sessions, hence not applying the
   "SHOULD be removed" in Section 6 of [RFC4360].

   While all these behaviors are compliant with RFC 4360, they limit the
   benefits of non-transitive communities to internal uses.


4.  Suggested clarifications

   The suggested clarification for (Clarification A) is to let RFC 4360
   specify that all routes received carrying an extended communities
   attribute containing a non-transitive community SHOULD have
   this(these) non-transitive community(ies) removed before advertising
   the route to another Autonomous System (i.e. on an eBGP session).
   Note that this behavior and wording is in-lined with the definition
   of the NO_EXPORT well known community in [RFC1997].  It allows the
   advertisement of a non-transitive extended community over an eBGP
   session if this community is added on the outbound policy of an eBGP
   session.

   The suggested clarification for (Clarification B) is to let RFC 4360
   specify that a BGP speaker supporting RFC 4360 SHOULD NOT silently
   enforce the removal of a non-transitive attribute received over an
   eBGP session, but SHOULD allow this community to be captured by a
   configured inbound filter associated with eBGP sessions.  This
   behaviour MAY be made configurable but the default SHOULD be to
   implement the suggested clarifications defined above in this section.
