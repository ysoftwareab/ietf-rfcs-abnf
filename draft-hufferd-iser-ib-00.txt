Abstract 
 
   The iSCSI Extensions for RDMA document [iSER] currently specifies 
   the RDMA data transfer capability for [iSCSI] over iWARP.  This 
   document generalizes the iSER document to permit it to be used with 
   other RDMA capable protocols such as InfiniBand.

1  Motivation 

   Currently the work to define iSCSI extensions for RDMA [iSER] only 
   considers using the iWARP protocol suite.  While this objective 
   meets the short term requirement since iSCSI is defined only for 
   TCP, there is a huge benefit to generalize a standardized [iSER] so 
   that it can be used with other types of RDMA capable Protocol layers 
   now and in the future such as InfiniBand (with reliable connections, 
   RC). 

   The interest in using [iSER] for InfiniBand is based on exploiting 
   the iSCSI protocol features and its discovery and management 
   protocol instead of using the SCSI RDMA Protocol (SRP) which lacks 
   the management and discovery support.  Furthermore, with an iSCSI 
   based protocol, the storage professional and/or administrator only 
   needs to understand and support a single basic protocol, which has 
   similar implementations across a suite of different network types 
   (iWARP, InfiniBand, etc.). 

   It was to enable this vision and desire for a single storage 
   protocol that the proposed generalizations to [iSER] were created.

2  Overall generalizations needed within the iSER specification 

   This section will specify changes/adjustments that are to be made in 
   the iSER document to make it more general.  The goal of these 
   changes is not to modify the basic operation of iSCSI/iSER when 
   operating on iWARP, but to change/adjust the wording in such a way 
   that iSCSI/iSER can be layered over a different RDMA-capable 
   protocol layer such as InfiniBand. 

   The details of many of the suggested changes can be found in the 
   Section 3 of this document. 

   In general the iSER specification is hereby modified to apply to not 
   only iWARP, but to other RDMA-Capable Protocols, such as InfiniBand.  
   Except for the unique features of non iWARP protocols dealing with 
   initial Login and Security, the rest of the iSER document is 
   applicable these other RDMA-Capable Protocols (such as InfiniBand.)  

2.1 Generalization of Definitions 

   It is required that some of the terminology be clarified as to the 
   applicability of the terms to the actual LLP used.   

2.1.1  The iWARP term 

   As currently defined, the iWARP term has a strong TCP centric bias.  
   We are introducing a new, more generic term, known as RDMA-Capable 
   Protocol (RCP) to denote the protocol layer that provides the RDMA 
   functionality for iSER.  The following term will be added to the 
   Definition section: 

   RDMA-Capable Protocol -                         - The protocol or protocol suite that provides 
   the RDMA functionality, e.g., iWARP, InfiniBand, etc. 

   With these new definitions, the "iWARP" term is hereby generalized 
   as follows: 

     1. Whenever the term "iWARP protocol suite" occurs in the iSER 
        draft, it is hereby replaced by "RDMA-Capable Protocol".  In 
        addition, the phrase "such as the iWARP protocol suite" is 
        hereby added only where necessary to denote cases that only 
        apply for iWARP.  

     2. Whenever the term "iWARP layer" occurs in the iSER draft, it is 
        hereby replaced by "RDMA-capable protocol layer".  In addition, 

J.Hufferd et. al.           Expires January 2006                     5 
Internet-Draft  Generalization of the iSER Specification  July 2005 
 
 
        the phrase "such as the iWARP Layer" is hereby added only where 
        necessary to denote cases that only apply for iWARP.  

     3. Whenever the term "iWARP" is used as an adjective in other 
        context, it is hereby replaced with just RDMA, or "RDMA-
        Capable", whichever is appropriate.  E.g., "iWARP 
        functionality" is replaced with "RDMA functionality". 

     4. Whenever the term "iWARP" is used as shorthand for the iWARP 
        protocol suite, it is hereby replaced by "RDMA-capable 
        protocol". 

2.1.2  The RNIC term 

   The term "RNIC" has been generally accepted by the industry to mean 
   an RDMA-enabled Network Interface Controller for the IP world.  So 
   to generalize iSER for any RDMA-capable protocol layer, we will 
   introduce a new term known as RDMA-Capable Controller, defined as 
   follows: 

        RDMA-Capable Controller -                                - A network I/O adapter or embedded 
        controller with RDMA functionality.  E.g., for TCP/IP, this can 
        be an RNIC, and for InfiniBand, this could be a HCA (Host 
        Channel Adapter) or TCA (Target Channel Adapter). 

   Within the body of the iSER document the term RDMA-Capable 
   Controller is hereby used whenever the intention is to refer to a 
   general controller that provides RDMA functionality.  In addition, 
   the clause "such as an RNIC" is hereby added as necessary where the 
   clear intent of the statement is to address an iWARP RDMA-Capable 
   Controller.  

   Within the body of the iSER document, the term RNIC is left 
   unchanged if it specifically or implicitly refers to TCP/IP. 

2.1.3  Steering Tag (STag) 

   The Steering Tag (STag) term hereby has its definition extended so 
   that it applies to both a Tag for a Remote Buffer, and the Tag for a 
   Local Buffer. The following is a replacement for the existing 
   Steering Tag definition in the definition section.  

        Steering Tag (STag) - An identifier of a Tagged Buffer on a 
        Node (Local or Remote) as defined in [RDMAP] and [DDP].  For 
        other RDMA-Capable protocol layers, the Steering Tag may be 
        known by different names but even so they will be herein 
        referred to as STags.  For example, for InfiniBand, a Remote

Internet-Draft  Generalization of the iSER Specification  July 2005 
 
 
        STag is known as an R-Key, and a Local STag is known as an L-
        Key and they will both be considered STags.   

2.1.4  Inbound RDMA Read Queue Depth (IRD) & Outbound RDMA Read Queue 
     Depth (ORD) 

   To generalize on the terms Inbound RDMA Read Queue Depth (IRD) and 
   the Outbound RDMA Read Queue Depth (ORD) for other RDMA-Capable 
   protocol layers, the following is added to the definition for IRD: 
   "For other RDMA-Capable protocol layers, the term "IRD" may be known 
   by a different name.  For example, for InfiniBand, the equivalent 
   for IRD is the Responder Resources".  For ORD, the following is 
   added: "For other RDMA-Capable Protocol Layer, the term "ORD" may be 
   known by a different name.  For example, for InfiniBand, the 
   equivalent for ORD is the Initiator Depth." 

2.1.5  RDMA Protocol (RDMAP)  

   In the body of the document the term "RDMA-Capable Protocol", or 
   "RCP" is hereby used whenever any RDMA wire protocol or RDMA 
   protocol stack is applicable.  Only when the document intends to 
   explicitly address a specific iWARP wire protocol is the term 
   [RDMAP] used. 

2.1.6  RDMAP Layer  

   In the body of the document the term "RDMAP Layer" is hereby 
   replaced with the term "RCP Layer". 

2.1.7  RDMAP Stream 

   The following is hereby included in the definition section replacing 
   the term "RDMAP Stream": 

        RCP Stream - A single bidirectional association between the 
        peer RDMA-capable protocol layers on two Nodes over a single 
        transport-level stream.  For TCP, an RCP Stream is also known 
        as an RDMAP Stream.  For iSER/TCP, the association is created 
        when the connection transitions to iSER-assisted mode following 
        a successful Login Phase during which iSER support is 
        negotiated.   

  In the body of the document, the term "RDMAP Stream" is hereby 
  replaced by the term "RCP Stream".

2.1.8  RDMAP Message 

   The following is included in the definition section to replace 
   "RDMAP Message": 

        RCP Message -                    - The sequence of packets of the RDMA-capable 
        protocol which represent a single RDMA operation or a part of 
        RDMA Read Operation.  For TCP, an RCP Message is also known as 
        an RDMAP Message. 

   In the body of the document, the term "RDMAP Message" is hereby 
   replaced by the term "RCP Message".  The exception to this is when 
   the term "RDMAP Message" is used to describe the iSER Hello and 
   HelloReply Messages.  Here "RDMAP Message" is hereby replaced by 
   "iSER Message" in order to accommodate LLPs that have message 
   delivery capability such as [IB].  The iSCSI layer may use that 
   messaging capability immediately after connection establishment 
   before enabling iSER-assisted mode.  In the case the iSER Hello and 
   HelloReply Messages are not the first RCP Messages, but they are the 
   first iSER Messages. 

2.2 The following is placed/updated in the Acronym Section 

   HCA         Host Channel Adapter  

   IB          InfiniBand 

   IPoIB       IP over InfiniBand 

   LLP         Lower Layer Protocol 

   TCA        Target Channel Adapter  

2.3 Connection Establishment, Login, and Transition to iSER 

   The discussion of connection establishment and the use of a 
   messaging protocol for exchanging Login Request and Login Response 
   PDUs for IB are inserted in this section, along with the extended 
   specification of the transition of an IB connection to iSER mode.  
   The suggested detail changes can be found in section 3.1.6.1 through 
   section 3.1.6.3 of this document. 

2.4 Security considerations 

   The security consideration are updated to include requirements on 
   security for transports other than TCP, the document now states that 
   the security concerns must be addressed appropriately for different 

J.Hufferd et. al.           Expires January 2006                     8 
Internet-Draft  Generalization of the iSER Specification  July 2005 
 
 
   transport environments. However the iSCSI implementation 
   requirements for IPsec are still required wherever an iSER Message 
   enters an IP environment from a non IP one (such as IB).  Further 
   the iSCSI/iSER requirement for IPsec on IP based protocols such as 
   TCP will continue to require IPsec as a must implement, but optional 
   to use.  There is now a SHOULD implement (optional to use) 
   requirement on non IP networks for a packet by packet security 
   facility that is at least as strong as that required by [iSCSI]. 

   The exact wordage can be found in section 3.1.6.4 of this document. 

2.5 Adjustments to the iSER Appendix. 

   The current iSER appendix will hereby be renamed "Appendix A". 

2.6 Add Appendix B  

   A new informational appendix (Appendix B) is hereby added that 
   explains how an InfiniBand RC connection can be used to carry the 
   iSER protocol.  The content of the new appendix B is that which is 
   contained in the appendix (section 6) of this document.

3  Additional detailed [iSER] document modification 

   The new terms introduced in the subsections under section 2.1 will 
   replace the existing ones in the [iSER] document where appropriate.  
   In addition, the following changes and clarifications are needed. 

3.1.1  Adjustment to Section 2.1 Motivation 

   The fourth paragraph is hereby adjusted to:  

        Supporting direct data placement is the main function of an 
        RDMA-capable protocol.  An RDMA-Capable Controller (such as a 
        NIC enhanced with the RDMAP/DDP functions layered on top of 
        MPA/TCP, or an InfiniBand Host Channel Adapter or Target 
        Channel Adapter) can be used by any application that has been 
        extended to support RDMA.  

3.1.2  Adjustment to Section 2.2 Architectural Goals 

   The following are changes for the numbered paragraphs: 

        1. Provide an RDMA data transfer model for iSCSI that enables 
        direct in order or out of order data placement of SCSI data 
        into pre-allocated SCSI buffers while maintaining in order data 
        delivery. 

        5. Allow initiator and target implementations to utilize 
        generic RDMA-Capable Controllers such as RNICs, or implement 
        iSCSI and iSER in software (not require iSCSI or iSER specific 
        assists in the RDMA-Capable Protocol or RDMA-Capable 
        Controller).  

        6. Require full and only generic RDMA-Capable Protocol 
        functionality at both the initiator and the target. 

3.1.3  Adjustment to Section 2.3 Protocol Overview  

   The following change is hereby made to paragraph number 6: 

        6. The RDMA-Capable Protocol guarantees data integrity.  (For 
        example, for TCP, iWARP includes a CRC-enhanced framing layer 
        (called MPA) on top of TCP; and for InfiniBand, the CRCs are 
        included in the Reliable Connection mode.)  For this reason, 
        iSCSI header and data digests are negotiated to "None" for 
        iSCSI/iSER sessions.

Internet-Draft  Generalization of the iSER Specification  July 2005 
 
 
3.1.4  Adjustment to Section 2.4 RDMA services and iSER  

   The following change is hereby made to the first paragraph: 

        iSER is designed to work with software and/or hardware protocol 
        stacks providing the protocol services defined in RDMA-Capable 
        Protocol documents such as [RDMAP], [IB], etc. 

3.1.5  Adjustment to Section 2.7 iSCSI/iSER Layering  

   The layering wordage needed additional generalization and the 
   example needed to be made more general.  Therefore, the following is 
   the change in wordage and the replacement for Figure 1: 

        "iSCSI Extensions for RDMA (iSER) is layered between the iSCSI 
        layer and the RDMA-Capable Protocol Layer.  Figure 1 shows an 
        example of the relationship between SCSI, iSCSI, iSER, RDMA-
        capable protocol layers such as iWARP and [IB], and the 
        underlying transports such as TCP, or [IB]. Note that the iSCSI 
        layer as described here supports the RDMA Extensions as used in 
        iSER."

   The title of section 4.1 -- "Interaction with the iWARP Layer" -- is 
   hereby changed to "Interaction with the RDMA-Capable Protocol 
   Layer". 

   The first paragraph in Section 4.1 is hereby changed to: 

        The iSER protocol layer is layered on top of the RCP Stack (see 
        Figure 1) and the following are the key features that are 
        assumed to be supported by the RDMA-Capable Protocol Layer

Internet-Draft  Generalization of the iSER Specification  July 2005 
 
 
   The third paragraph in Section 4.1 is hereby changed to: 

        * The layers handling the RDMA Capable Protocol provide 
        reliable, in-order message delivery and direct data placement. 

    

   And in that same section (4.1) the next to last * paragraph is 
   hereby replaced with the following: 

        *   For LLPs operating in the stream mode such as TCP, the 
        RDMA-Capable Protocol implementation supports the enabling of 
        the RDMA mode after Connection establishment and the exchange 
        of Login parameters in stream mode.  For LLPs that have message 
        delivery capability such as [IB], the iSCSI Layer may use that 
        messaging capability immediately after connection establishment 
        before enabling iSER-assisted mode. The native messaging 
        facility of such an LLP may be used for the Login parameter 
        exchanges.  

   The following is a replacement for section 4.2 Interactions with the 
   Transport Layer 

        The iSER Layer does not directly setup the transport layer 
        connection (e.g., TCP, or [IB]).  During Connection setup, the 
        iSCSI Layer is responsible for setting up the Connection.  If 
        the login is    successful, the iSCSI Layer invokes the 
        Enable_Datamover Operational Primitive to request the iSER 
        Layer to transition to the iSER-assisted mode for that iSCSI 
        connection.  See section 5.1 on iSCSI/iSER Connection setup.  
        After transitioning to iSER-assisted mode, the RDMA-Capable 
        Protocol Layer and the underlying LLP are responsible for 
        maintaining the Connection and reporting to the iSER Layer any 
        Connection failures.  

3.1.6.1  Adjustments to 5.1 iSCSI/iSER Connection Setup  

   The following is a new Section 5.1 paragraph which is hereby 
   inserted after paragraph 1:  

        When a reliable messaging capability is supported by the 
        underlying transport (e.g. InfiniBand), the reliable messaging 
        capability may be used by both the initiator and the target to 
        exchange the iSCSI Login Request and Login Response PDUs.  The 
        method for establishing the actual connection is protocol 
        specific and outside the scope of this specification.

Internet-Draft  Generalization of the iSER Specification  July 2005 
 
 
   The following text is hereby added after the second paragraph of 
   Section 5.1: 

        If the transport layer is not TCP, and if the RDMAExtensions 
        key is not negotiated to Yes, then the connection will need to 
        be re-established in TCP capable mode. (For InfiniBand this 
        will require an [IPoIB] type connection.) 

   The following text is hereby added after the third paragraph of 
   Section 5.1: 

        Discovery sessions are always conducted using the TCP transport 
        layer. 

   The following is a replacement for the last paragraph in 5.1 

        When the RDMAExtensions key is negotiated to "Yes", the 
        HeaderDigest and the DataDigest keys MUST be negotiated to 
        "None" on all iSCSI/iSER connections participating in that 
        iSCSI session.  This is because, for an iSCSI/iSER connection, 
        the RDMA-Capable Protocol provides a CRC based error detection 
        for all iSER Messages.  

3.1.6.2  Adjustment to Section 5.1.1 Initiator Behavior 

   The following are changes for the 11th paragraph of section 5.1.1 
   Initiator Behavior.  

        3. If necessary, the iSER Layer MUST enable the RDMA-Capable 
        Protocol and transition the connection to iSER-assisted mode. 
        (Some RDMA-Capable Protocols, such as [IB], do not require 
        special enablement for RDMA support.)  

3.1.6.3  Adjustment to Section 5.1.2 Target Behavior 

   In section 5.1.2 all the references to "iWARP" are hereby replaced 
   with "the RDMA-Capable Protocol".  

   Also in Section 5.1.2, the paragraph numbered as "3." & "4." are 
   hereby replaced with the following: 

        3. If the underlying transport is TCP, then the iSER Layer MUST 
        send the final SCSI Login Response PDU in byte stream mode to 
        conclude the iSCSI Login Phase. If the underlying transport has 
        reliable messaging capability (e.g. IB RC) then the iSER layer 
        MUST send the final SCSI Login Response PDU in the reliable 
        message mode to conclude the iSCSI login phase.

Internet-Draft  Generalization of the iSER Specification  July 2005 
 
 
        4. After sending the final SCSI Login Response PDU, the iSER 
        Layer MUST enable the RDMA-Capable Protocol if necessary and 
        transition the connection to iSER-assisted mode.  (Some RDMA-
        Capable Protocols, such as [IB], do not require special 
        enablement for RDMA support.)    

   And the last paragraph in Section 5.1.2 is hereby replaced with:  

        Note: In the above sequence, the operations as described in    
        bullets 3 and 4 MUST be performed atomically for iWARP 
        connections.  Failure to do this may result in race conditions. 

   The following are changes for the second paragraph of 5.1.3 iSER 
   Hello Exchange.  (It tolerates connections that might already be in 
   RDMA mode when the Hello Exchanges were sent.) 

        In response to the iSER Hello Message, the iSER Layer at the 
        target MUST return the iSER HelloReply Message as the first RCP 
        Message sent by the target after the connection transitions 
        into iSER-assisted mode.  The iSER HelloReply Message is used 
        by the iSER Layer at the target to declare iSER parameters to 
        the initiator.  See section 9.4 on iSER Header Format for iSER 
        HelloReply Message. 

3.1.6.4  Adjustments to Section 11 Security Considerations 

   The following paragraphs are replacement paragraphs for Section 11 
   Security Considerations.  

        When iSER is layered on top of an RDMA-Capable Protocol Layer 
        and provides the RMDA extension to the iSCSI protocol, the 
        security considerations of iSER are the same as that of the 
        underlying RDMA-Capable Protocol Layer.  For iWARP, this is 
        described in [RDMAP] and [RDDPSEC]. 

        Since iSER-assisted iSCSI protocol is still functionally iSCSI 
        from a security considerations perspective, all of the iSCSI 
        security requirements as described in [RFC3720] and [RFC3723] 
        apply.   

        If the IPsec mechanism is used, then it MUST be established 
        before the connection transitions to iSER-assisted mode. 

        If iSER is layered on top of a non-IP based RDMA-Capable 
        Protocol Layer, all the security protocol mechanisms applicable 
        to that RDMA-Capable Protocol Layer is also applicable to an 
        iSCSI/iSER connection.

Internet-Draft  Generalization of the iSER Specification  July 2005 
 
 
        If iSER is layered on top of a non-IP protocol, the IPsec 
        protocols and features, as specified in [iSCSI] MUST be 
        implemented at any point where the iSER protocol enters the IP 
        network (e.g., via gateways). And the non-IP protocol SHOULD 
        implement (optional to use) a packet by packet security 
        protocol equal in strength to the IPsec protocol specified by 
        [iSCSI].

6  Appendix  

6.1 Architectural discussion of iSER over InfiniBand  

   This entire appendix is hereby included as Appendix B in the iSCSI 
   Extensions for RDMA document [iSER]. 

   The following is an explanation of how an InfiniBand network (with 
   Gateways) would be structured.  It is intended to provide insight on 
   how iSER is used in an InfiniBand environment and be generally 
   informational.  It is informational only and it is intended to put 
   the idea of an iSER operating on InfiniBand into perspective for the 
   readers of this document.  

6.2 The Host side of the InfiniBand iSCSI & iSER connections 

   Figure 2 (iSCSI, and iSER on IB) defines the topologies in which 
   iSCSI and iSER will be able to operate on an InfiniBand Network.

   switch(es), the InfiniBand links connect the HCA to InfiniBand 
   Target Channel Adapters (TCAs) located in gateways or Storage 
   Controllers.  An iSER-capable IB-IP Gateway converts the iSER 
   Messages encapsulated in IB protocols to either standard iSCSI, or 
   iSER Messages for iWARP.  An [IPoIB] Gateway converts the InfiniBand 
   [IPoIB] protocol to IP protocol, and in the iSCSI case, permits 
   iSCSI to be operated on an IB Network between the Hosts and the 
   [IPoIB] Gateway.

     Figure 3 - Storage Controller with TCP, iWARP, and IB Connections 

   The normal iSCSI portal group advertising processes (for SLP, iSNS, 
   or SendTargets commands) are available to a Storage Controller.   

6.4 Discovery processes for an InfiniBand Host 

   An InfiniBand Host system can gather portal group IP address from 
   SLP, iSNS, or the SendTargets discovery processes by using TCP/IP 
   via [IPoIB].  After obtaining one or more remote portal IP 
   addresses, the Initiator uses the standard IP mechanisms to resolve 
   the IP address to a local outgoing interface and the destination 
   hardware address (Ethernet MAC or IB GID of the target or a gateway 
   leading to the target).  If the resolved interface is an [IPoIB] 
   network interface, then the target portal can be reached through an 
   InfiniBand fabric.  In this case the Initiator can establish an 
   iSCSI/TCP or iSCSI/iSER session with the Target over that InfiniBand 
   interface, using the Hardware Address (InfiniBand GID) obtained 
   through the standard Address Resolution (ARP) processes.  

J.Hufferd et. al.           Expires January 2006                     22 
Internet-Draft  Generalization of the iSER Specification  July 2005 
 
 
   If more than one IP address are obtained through the discovery 
   process, the Initiator should select a Target IP address that is on 
   the same IP subnet as the Initiator if one exists.  This will avoid 
   a potential overhead of going through a gateway when a direct path 
   exists. 

   In addition a user can configure manual static IP route entries if a 
   particular path to the target is preferred.  

6.5 IBTA Connection specifications 

   It is outside the scope of this document, but it is expected that 
   the InfiniBand Trade Association (IBTA) has or will define: 

     . The iSER ServiceID  

     . A Means for permitting a Host to establish a connection with a 
        peer InfiniBand end-node, and that peer indicating when that 
        end-node supports iSER, so the Host would be able to fall back 
        to iSCSI/TCP over [IPoIB ].  

     . A Means for permitting the Host to establish connections with 
        IB iSER connections on storage controllers or IB iSER connected 
        Gateways in preference to [IPoIB] connected Gateways/Bridges or 
        connections to Target Storage Controllers that also accept 
        iSCSI via [IPoIB].  

     . A Means for combining the IB ServiceID for iSER and the IP port 
        number such that the IB Host can use normal IB connection 
        processes, yet ensure that the iSER target peer can actually 
        connect to the required IP port number.
