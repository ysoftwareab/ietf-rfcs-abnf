Internet-Draft      Yang Data Model for GRE Tunnel         October 2015


   This document defines a YANG data model for the management of GRE
   tunnels. The data model covers configuration data and operational
   state data.

1. Introduction

   This document defines a YANG [RFC6020] data model for the management
   of GRE tunnels. It covers the following types.

1.1. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2. Tree Diagrams

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   this document. The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is as
   follows:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write), and "ro" means state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!"
      means a presence container, and "*" denotes a list and leaf-list.

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are
      also marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

2. GRE Tunnel Data Model

   This document defines the YANG model "ietf-gre-tunnel", which
   includes two modules, one for configuration and one for state. The
   data model has the following tree diagram for the GRE tunnels:
