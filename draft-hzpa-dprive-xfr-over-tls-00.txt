                       DNS Zone Transfer over TLS
                   draft-hzpa-dprive-xfr-over-tls-00

Abstract

   DNS zone transfers are transmitted in clear text, which gives
   attackers the opportunity to collect the content of a zone by
   eavesdropping on links.  The DNS Transaction Signature (TSIG) is
   specified to restrict direct zone transfer to authorized clients, but
   it does not add confidentiality.  This document specifies use of TLS
   to prevent zone collection

1.  Introduction

   DNS has a number of privacy vulnerabilities, as discussed in detail
   in [RFC7626].  Query privacy has received the most attention.  There
   are now standards for three encryption capabilities for queries and
   more work going on to guide deployment [RFC7858] [RFC8484].

   [RFC7626] established that the query transactions are not public and
   needed protection, but on zone transfer it says only: Privacy risks
   for the holder of a zone (the risk that someone gets the data) are
   discussed in [RFC5936] and [RFC5155].

   In what way is exposing the full content of a zone a privacy risk?
   The contents of the zone could include information such as names of
   persons used in names of hosts.  Best practice is not to use personal
   information for domain names, but many such domain names exist.
   There may also be regulatory or other reasons why the zone content in
   full must be treated as private.

   Neither of the RFCs mentioned by RFC7626 contemplates the risk that
   someone gets the data through link eavesdropping.

Internet-Draft                XFR over TLS                    March 2019


   [RFC5155] specifies NSEC3 to prevent zone enumeration, which is when
   queries for the authenticated denial of existences records of DNSSEC
   allow a client to walk through the entire zone.  Note that the need
   for this protection also motivates NSEC5; zone walking is now
   possible with NSEC3 due to crypto-breaking advances, and NSEC5 is a
   response to this problem.

   [RFC5155] does not address data obtained outside zone enumeration
   (nor does NSEC5).  Preventing eavesdropping of zone transfers (this
   draft) is orthogonal to preventing zone enumeration, though they aim
   to protect the same information.

   [RFC5936] specifies using TSIG [RFC2845] for authorization of the
   clients of a zone transfer and for data integrity, but does not
   express any need for confidentiality, and TSIG does not offer
   encryption.  Some operators use SSH tunneling or IPSEC to encrypt the
   transfer data.  Because the AXFR zone transfer is carried out over
   TCP from DNS protocol implementations, encrypting AXFR using DNS over
   TLS [RFC7858], aka DOT, seems like a simple step forward.  This
   document specifies how to use DOT to prevent zone collection from
   zone transfers, including discussion of approaches for IXFR, which
   uses UDP or TCP.

   Next steps: work on questions at DNS table during Hackathon, expand
   this draft, then solicit discussion on the DPRIVE mailing list.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Privacy terminology is as described in Section 3 of [RFC6973].

   DNS terminology is as described in [RFC8499]:

5.  Session Establishment and Closing

   Subsection - AXFR Sessions

   The connection flow in AXFR is a NOTIFY from the primary server to
   the secondary server, and then an AXFR request from the secondary to
   the primay after which the data flows.

   The connection for AXFR SHOULD be established using port 853, as
   specified in [RFC7858].  If there is no response on port 853, the
   connection MAY be attempted using port 443.

   TODO: diagram of connection flow for AXFR, without and with DOT

   Subsection - IXFR Sessions (?)

   [RFC1995] specifies that Incremental Transfer may use UDP if the
   entire IXFR response can be contained in a single DNS packet,
   otherwise, TCP is used.

   Given this, how should confidentiality of IXFR be provided?  To
   discuss: should IXFR have a mode in which TCP is mandatory?  or
   should there be an approach of starting with DNS over DTLS, and
   switching to DNS over TLS with a TCP switch?  In workloads where
   there are frequent IXFRs, is the persistent mode that TCP-Mode would
   enable (as well as the retries, a benefit?

   Subsection - Policies for Both AXFR and IXFR

   In order to assure the confidentiality of the zone information, all
   the servers (primary and secondary) MUST have a consistent
   confidentiality use.  If any do not, this is a weak link for
   attackers to exploit.  How to do this is TBD.

   The entire group (the primary and all secondaries) MUST have a
   consistent policy on Strict or Non-Strict mode of operation.  How to
   do this is TBD.

   Subsection - Next Steps

   Upcoming open hackathon experiments will feed into this Session
   Establishment and Closing section, as much about this needs
   exploration as well as dicussion on the mailing list.

6.  Performance Considerations

   The details in [RFC7858] about using persistent connections and TLS
   Session Resume are fully applicable to DNS Transfer over DOT as well.

7.  Implementation Considerations

   TBA

8.  IANA Considerations

   TBD

9.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies a security measure against a DNS risk, the
   risk that an attacker collects entire DNS zones through eavesdropping
   on plaintext DNS zone transfers.  It presents a new Security
   Consideration for DNS.  Some questions to discuss are: should DOT in
   this new case be required to use only TLS1.3 and higher to avoid
   residual exposure?  How should padding be used (if it should)?
