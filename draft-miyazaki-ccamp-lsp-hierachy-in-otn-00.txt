   on this Recommendation, several hierarchical LSPs are needed to setup 
   an end-to-end client signal and LSP hierarchy becomes very complex. 

   However, this document describes the example of networks and shows 
   the LSP hierarchy in OTN.

1. Introduction 

   As described in [ITU-T G.872], ITU-T defined the digital layers and 
   the optical layers in the OTN(Optical Transport Network) to supervise 
   and control the optical paths. In the digital OTN, OPUk(Optical 
   Channel Payload Unit), ODUk(Optical Channel Data Unit) and OUT.
   (optical Channel Transport Unit) are defined. In these layers, the 
   optical stream is terminated and the Digital Wrapper Overhead is 
   managed. In the optical OTN, Optical Channel, Optical Multiplex 
   Section and Optical Transmission Section are defined. And there is no 
   electric process in these layers. Otherwise there is client other 
   than the digital OTN (pre-OTN). 

   This document presents the LSP hierarchy in the OTN.

2. Network examples 

   Based on the [ITU-T G.872], there are some structures shown from 
   Figure 2 to Figure 8. 

   In Figure 2, OXCs does not handle the Digital Wrapper and the ingress 
   OXC converts the specific wavelength to transmit the client signal to 
   the egress OXC. And the encoding between OXCs is lambda. Based on the 
   G.872, there is one lambda LSP between ingress and egress OXC.

   In Figure 3 and 4, some OXCs deal with the Digital Wrapper, and some 
   transit OXCs do not deal with the Digital Wrapper. And the encoding 
   between OXC1 and OXC2 in Figure 4 is the digital wrapper. In these

   In Figure 6, transit OXCs terminate the client signal. The encoding 
   between OXC2 and OXC3 is encoding of client signal such as SDH/SONET. 
   Therefore there is one client LSP and two digital wrapper LSPs and

   ODU2(10Gbps). In this network, we must setup digital wrapper LSP with

   And the digital wrapper LSP with ODU1 between OXC1 and OXC4 must be

3. LSP hierarchy in OTN  

   Based on the G.872, we must setup several LSPs to setup an end-to-end 
   LSP shown in section 2.  

   When we setup a LSP with the lambda encoding, TE link with the 
   digital wrapper or the SONET/SDH encoding can not be used.  But a LSP 
   with the digital wrapper can use the TE link with the lambda encoding. 

   When the LSP with lambda encoding is required, figure 2 network may 
   be available for that requirement. When the LSP with the digital 
   wrapper encoding is required, figure 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 networks may be 
   available. In these network, some hierarchical LSPs such as 
   lambda(OCh) and the digital wrapper(ODU2) are exist. When the LSP 
   with the client encoding is required, all figure network may be 
   available if the transponder can accommodate the client signal.  

    

   And, when the ODU multiplexer between ODU1(2.5Gbps), ODU2(10Gbps) and 
   ODU3(40Gbps) exists, the LSPs in each ODUk layer must be created. 

    

   Otherwise from the view point of the network management, the operator 
   should monitor the LSPs to guarantee the QoS. In the digital OTN, the 
   Tandem Connection Monitoring may be used for fault localization or

   verification of delivered quality of service. In the optical OTN, 
   optical monitoring such as OSNR may be used. In the pre-OTN, some 
   client mechanism may be used. Otherwise, the alarm notification 
   mechanism is different each other. 

 

   Therefore, the LSPs in each digital OTN should be separated. And when the 
   LSP in digital OTN is required, the LSPs in the optical OTN should not be created.
