1.  Introduction

   Note: Efforts to synchronize structure and terminology with
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry] will likely be incomplete until both
   drafts are stable.

   This memo defines the Initial set of entries for the Performance
   Metric Registry.  The registry will contain Active Performance
   Metrics, especially those defined in RFCs prepared in the IP
   Performance Metrics (IPPM) Working Group of the IETF, according to
   their framework [RFC2330].  Three aspects make IPPM metric
   registration difficult: (1) Use of the Type-P notion to allow users
   to specify their own packet types. (2) Use of Flexible input
   variables, called Parameters in IPPM definitions, some which
   determine the quantity measured and others which should not be
   specified until execution of the measurement.  (3) Allowing

   flexibility in choice of statistics to summarize the results on a
   stream of measurement packets.  This memo uses terms and definitions
   from the IPPM literature, primarily [RFC2330], and the reader is
   assumed familiar with them or may refer questions there as necessary.

   Although there are several standard templates for organizing
   specifications of performance metrics (see [RFC2679] for an example
   of the traditional IPPM template, based to large extent on the
   Benchmarking Methodology Working Group's traditional template in
   [RFC1242], and see [RFC6390] for a similar template), none of these
   templates were intended to become the basis for the columns of an
   IETF-wide registry of metrics.  As we examined the aspects of metric
   specifications which need to be registered, it was clear that none of
   the existing metric templates fully satisfies the particular needs of
   a registry.

2.  Scope

   [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry] defines the overall structure for a
   Performance Metric Registry and provides guidance for the process to
   examine proposed metrics and maitain Registered Metrics.

   This document defines the initial set of Performance Metrics Registry
   entries; all are active metrics, or those where the packets measured
   have been specially generated for the purpose.

   A row in the registry corresponds to one Registered Performance
   Metric, with entries in the various columns specifying the metric.

   As discussed in [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry], each entry (row)
   must be tightly defined; the definition must leave open only a few
   parameters that do not change the fundamental nature of the
   measurement (such as source and destination addresses), and so
   promotes comparable results across independent implementations.
   Also, each registered entry must be based on existing reference RFCs
   (or other standards) for performance metrics, and must be
   operationally useful and have significant industry interest.  This is
   ensured by expert review for every entry before IANA action.

3.  Registry Categories and Columns

   This section defines the categories and columns of the registry.
   Below, categories are described at the 3.x heading level, and columns
   are at the 3.x.y heading level.  The Figure below illustrates this
   organization.  An entry (row) therefore gives a complete description
   of a Registered Metric.

   Each column serves as a check-list item and helps to avoid omissions
   during registration and expert review.  In some cases an entry (row)
   may have some columns without specific entries, marked Not Applicable
   (NA).

4.  UDP Round-trip Latency Registry Entry

   This section gives an initial registry entry for the UDP Round-trip
   Latency.

   Note: If each Registry entry should only produce a "raw" output or a
   statistical summary, then the "Output" Category can be split and this
   section can become two closely-related metrics.

4.1.  Summary

   This category includes multiple indexes to the registry entries, the
   element ID and metric name.

4.1.4.  Description

   This metric assesses the delay of a stream of packets exchanged
   between two hosts (or measurement points), and reports the Round-trip
   delay for all successfully exchanged packets and the 95th percentile
   of their conditional delay distribution.

4.2.  Metric Definition

   This category includes columns to prompt the entry of all necessary
   details related to the metric definition, including the RFC reference
   and values of input factors, called fixed parameters.

4.2.1.  Reference Definition

   <Full bibliographic reference to an immutable doc.>

   Almes, G., Kalidindi, S., and M.  Zekauskas, "A Round-trip Delay
   Metric for IPPM", RFC 2681, September 1999.

   [RFC2681]

   <specific section reference and additional clarifications, if needed>

   Section 2.4 of [RFC2681] provides the reference definition of the
   singleton (single value) Round-trip delay metric.  Section 3.4 of
   [RFC2681] provides the reference definition expanded to cover a
   multi-value sample.  Note that terms such as singleton and sample are
   defined in Section 11 of [RFC2330].

   Note that although the definition of "Round-trip-Delay between Src
   and Dst at T" is directionally ambiguous in the text, this metric
   tightens the definition further to recognize that the host in the
   "Src" role will send the first packet to "Dst", and ultimately
   receive the corresponding return packet from "Dst" (when neither are
   lost).

4.2.2.  Fixed Parameters

   <list and specify Fixed Parameters, input factors that must be
   determined and embedded in the measurement system for use when
   needed>

   o  IPv4 header values:

      *  TTL set to 255

      *  Protocol: Set to 17 (UDP)

   o  UDP header values:

      *  Checksum: the checksum must be calculated

   o  Payload

      *  Sequence number: 8-byte integer

      *  Timestamp: 8 byte integer.  Expressed as 64-bit NTP timestamp
         as per section 6 of RFC 5905 [RFC5905]

      *  No padding (total of 9 bytes)

   Timeout, Tmax: 3 seconds

4.3.  Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of
   the RFC(s) and any supplemental information needed to ensure an
   unambiguous methods for implementations.

4.3.1.  Reference Method

   <for metric, insert relevant section references and supplemental
   info>

   The methodology for this metric is defined as Type-P-Round-trip-
   Delay-Poisson-Stream in section 2.6 of RFC 2681 [RFC2681] and section
   3.6 of RFC 2681 [RFC2681] using the Type-P and Timeout defined under
   Fixed Parameters.

   The method requires sequence numbers or other send-order information
   to be retained at the Src or included with each packet to dis-
   ambiguate packet reordering if it occurs.  Sequence number is part of
   the payload described under Fixed Parameters.

   Refer to Section 4.4 of [RFC6673] for expanded discussion of the
   instruction to "send a Type-P packet back to the Src as quickly as
   possible" in Section 2.6 of RFC 2681 [RFC2681].  Section 8 of
   [RFC6673] presents additional requirements which shall be included in
   the method of measurement for this metric.

4.3.2.  Packet Generation Stream

   This section gives the details of the packet traffic which is the
   basis for measurement.  In IPPM metrics, this is called the Stream,
   and can easily be dscribed by providing the list of stream
   parameters.

   <list of generation parameters and section/spec references if needed>

   Section 11.1.3 of RFC 2681 [RFC2330] provides three methods to
   generate Poisson sampling intervals. the reciprocal of lambda is the
   average packet rate, thus the Run-time Parameter is 1/lambda.

   >>> Check with Sam, most likely it is this...

   Method 3 is used, where given a start time (Run-time Parameter), the
   subsequent send times are all computed prior to measurement by
   computing the pseudo-random distribution of inter-packet send times,
   (truncating the distribution as specified in the Run-time
   Parameters), and the Src sends each packet at the computed times.

4.3.3.  Traffic Filtering (observation) Details

   The measured results based on a filtered version of the packets
   observed, and this section provides the filter details (when
   present).

   <section reference>.

   NA

4.3.4.  Sampling Distribution

   <insert time distribution details, or how this is diff from the
   filter>

   NA

4.3.5.  Run-time Parameters and Data Format

   Run-time Parameters are input factors that must be determined,
   configured into the measurement system, and reported with the results
   for the context to be complete.

   <list of run-time parameters, and their data formats>

   o  Src, the IP address of a host (32-bit value for IPv4, 128-bit
      value for IPv6)



Morton, et al.         Expires September 10, 2015              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft              Initial Registry                  March 2015


   o  Dst, the IP address of a host (32-bit value for IPv4, 128-bit
      value for IPv6)

   o  T0, a time (start of measurement interval, 128-bit NTP Date
      Format, see section 6 of [RFC5905]).  When T0 is "all-zeros", a
      start time is unspecified and Tf is to be interpreted as the
      Duration of the measurement interval.

   o  Tf, a time (end of measurement interval, 128-bit NTP Date Format,
      see section 6 of [RFC5905]), interpreted as the Duration of the
      measurement interval.

   o  1/lambda, average packet rate (for Poisson Streams).  (1/lambda =
      1 packet per second, if fixed)

   o  Upper limit on Poisson distribution (values above this limit will
      be clipped and set to the limit value). (if fixed, Upper limit =
      30 seconds.)

   The format for 1/lambda and Upper limit of Poisson Dist.  are the
   short format in [RFC5905] (32 bits) and is as follows: the first 16
   bits represent the integer number of seconds; the next 16 bits
   represent the fractional part of a second.

   >>> should Poisson run-time params be fixed instead? probably yes if
   modeling a specific version of MBA tests.

4.3.6.  Roles

   <lists the names of the different roles from the measurement method>

   Src - launches each packet and waits for return transmissions from
   Dst.

   Dst - waits for each packet from Src and sends a return packet to
   Src.

4.4.  Output

   This category specifies all details of the Output of measurements
   using the metric.

4.4.1.  Type/Value (two diff terms used)

   <insert name of the output type, raw or a selected summary statistic>

   Raw -- for each packet sent, pairs of values.

   valid value of Round-trip delay (undefined delays are excluded), a
   single value corresponding to the 95th percentile.

4.4.2.  Data Format

   <describe the data format for each type of result>

   For all outputs ---

   o  T0, a time (start of measurement interval, 128-bit NTP Date

   o  Tf, a time (end of measurement interval, 128-bit NTP Date Format,
      see section 6 of [RFC5905])

   Raw -- for each packet sent, pairs of values as follows:

   o  T, the time when the packet was sent from Src, 128-bit NTP Date
      Format, see section 6 of [RFC5905])

   o  dT, a value of Round-trip delay, format is *similar to* the 32-bit
      short NTP Time format in Section 6 of [RFC5905] and is as follows:
      the first 16 bits represent the *signed* integer number of
      seconds; the next 16 bits represent the fractional part of a
      second.

   o  dT is undefined when the packet is not received at Src in waiting
      time Tmxax seconds (need undefined code)

   Percentile -- for the conditional distribution of all packets with a
   valid value of Round-trip delay (undefined delays are excluded), a
   single value as follows:

   See section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details on the conditional
   distribution to exclude undefined values of delay, and Section 5 of
   [RFC6703] for background on this analysis choice.

   See section 4.3 of [RFC3393] for details on the percentile statistic
   (where Round-trip delay should be substituted for "ipdv").

   The percentile = 95.

   Data format is a 32-bit signed value, *similar to* the 32-bit short
   NTP Time format in Section 6 of [RFC5905] and is as follows: the
   first 16 bits represent the *signed* integer number of seconds; the
   next 16 bits represent the fractional part of a second.

   Lost packets represent a challenge for delay variation metrics.  See
   section 4.1 of [RFC3393] and the delay variation applicability
   statement[RFC5481] for extensive analysis and comparison of PDV and
   an alternate metric, IPDV.

6.  DNS Response Latency Registry Entry

   This section gives an initial registry entry for DNS Response
   Latency.  RFC 2681 [RFC2681] defines a Round-trip delay metric.  We
   build on that metric by specifying several of the input parameters to
   precisely define a metric for measuring DNS latency.

6.1.  Summary

   This category includes multiple indexes to the registry entries, the
   element ID and metric name.

6.1.4.  Description

   This metric assesses the response time, the interval from the query
   transmission to the response.

6.2.  Metric Definition

   This category includes columns to prompt the entry of all necessary
   details related to the metric definition, including the RFC reference
   and values of input factors, called fixed parameters.

6.2.1.  Reference Definition

   <Full bibliographic reference to an immutable doc.>

   Mockapetris, P., "Domain names - implementation and specification",
   STD 13, RFC 1035, November 1987. (and updates)

   [RFC1035]

   Almes, G., Kalidindi, S., and M.  Zekauskas, "A Round-trip Delay
   Metric for IPPM", RFC 2681, September 1999.

   [RFC2681]

   <specific section reference and additional clarifications, if needed>

   Section 2.4 of [RFC2681] provides the reference definition of the
   singleton (single value) Round-trip delay metric.  Section 3.4 of
   [RFC2681] provides the reference definition expanded to cover a
   multi-value sample.  Note that terms such as singleton and sample are
   defined in Section 11 of [RFC2330].

   For DNS Response Latency, the entities in [RFC1035] must be mapped to
   [RFC2681].  The Local Host with its User Program and Resolver take
   the role of "Src", and the Foreign Name Server takes the role of
   "Dst".

   Note that although the definition of "Round-trip-Delay between Src
   and Dst at T" is directionally ambiguous in the text, this metric
   tightens the definition further to recognize that the host in the
   "Src" role will send the first packet to "Dst", and ultimately
   receive the corresponding return packet from "Dst" (when neither are
   lost).

6.3.  Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of
   the RFC(s) and any supplemental information needed to ensure an
   unambiguous methods for implementations.

6.3.1.  Reference Method

   <for metric, insert relevant section references and supplemental
   info>

   The methodology for this metric is defined as Type-P-Round-trip-
   Delay-Poisson-Stream in section 2.6 of RFC 2681 [RFC2681] and section
   3.6 of RFC 2681 [RFC2681] using the Type-P and Timeout defined under
   Fixed Parameters.

   The method requires sequence numbers or other send-order information
   to be retained at the Src or included with each packet to dis-
   ambiguate packet reordering if it occurs.  Sequence number is part of
   the payload described under Fixed Parameters.

   DNS Messages bearing Queries provide for random ID Numbers, so more
   than one query may be launched while a previous request is
   outstanding when the ID Number is used.

   IF a DNS response does not arrive within Tmax, the result is
   undefined.  The Message ID SHALL be used to disambiguate the
   successive queries.

   >>> This would require support of ID generation and population in the
   Message.  An alternative would be to use a random Source port on the
   Query Message, but we would choose ONE before proceding.

   Refer to Section 4.4 of [RFC6673] for expanded discussion of the
   instruction to "send a Type-P packet back to the Src as quickly as
   possible" in Section 2.6 of RFC 2681 [RFC2681].  Section 8 of
   [RFC6673] presents additional requirements which shall be included in
   the method of measurement for this metric.

6.3.2.  Packet Generation Stream

   This section gives the details of the packet traffic which is the
   basis for measurement.  In IPPM metrics, this is called the Stream,
   and can easily be dscribed by providing the list of stream
   parameters.

   <list of generation parameters and section/spec references if needed>

   Section 11.1.3 of RFC 2681 [RFC2330] provides three methods to
   generate Poisson sampling intervals. the reciprocal of lambda is the
   average packet rate, thus the Run-time Parameter is 1/lambda.

   >>> Check with Sam, most likely it is this...

   Method 3 is used, where given a start time (Run-time Parameter), the
   subsequent send times are all computed prior to measurement by
   computing the pseudo-random distribution of inter-packet send times,
   (truncating the distribution as specified in the Run-time
   Parameters), and the Src sends each packet at the computed times.

6.3.3.  Traffic Filtering (observation) Details

   The measured results based on a filtered version of the packets
   observed, and this section provides the filter details (when
   present).

6.3.5.  Run-time Parameters and Data Format

   Run-time Parameters are input factors that must be determined,
   configured into the measurement system, and reported with the results
   for the context to be complete.

   <list of run-time parameters, and their data formats>

   o  Src, the IP address of a host (32-bit value for IPv4, 128-bit
      value for IPv6)

   o  Dst, the IP address of a host (32-bit value for IPv4, 128-bit
      value for IPv6)

   o  T0, a time (start of measurement interval, 128-bit NTP Date
      Format, see section 6 of [RFC5905]).  When T0 is "all-zeros", a
      start time is unspecified and Tf is to be interpreted as the
      Duration of the measurement interval.

   o  Tf, a time (end of measurement interval, 128-bit NTP Date Format,
      see section 6 of [RFC5905]), interpreted as the Duration of the
      measurement interval.

   o  1/lambda, average packet rate (for Poisson Streams).  (1/lambda =
      0.1 packet per second, if fixed)

   o  Upper limit on Poisson distribution (values above this limit will
      be clipped and set to the limit value). (if fixed, Upper limit =
      300 seconds.)

   o  ID, the 16-bit identifier assigned by the program that generates
      the query, and which must vary in successive queries, see
      Section 4.1.1 of [RFC1035].  This identifier is copied into the
      corresponding reply and can be used by the requester to match-up
      replies to outstanding queries.

   The format for 1/lambda and Upper limit of Poisson Dist.  are the
   short format in [RFC5905] (32 bits) and is as follows: the first 16
   bits represent the integer number of seconds; the next 16 bits
   represent the fractional part of a second.

   >>> should Poisson run-time params be fixed instead? probably yes if
   modeling a specific version of MBA tests.

6.3.6.  Roles

   <lists the names of the different roles from the measurement method>

   Src - launches each packet and waits for return transmissions from
   Dst.

   Dst - waits for each packet from Src and sends a return packet to
   Src.

6.4.  Output

   This category specifies all details of the Output of measurements
   using the metric.

6.4.1.  Type/Value (two diff terms used)

   <insert name of the output type, raw or a selected summary statistic>

   For all output types:

   o  T0, a time (start of measurement interval, 128-bit NTP Date
      Format, see section 6 of [RFC5905])

   o  Tf, a time (end of measurement interval, 128-bit NTP Date Format,
      see section 6 of [RFC5905])

   Raw -- for each packet sent, pairs of values.

   >>> and the status of the response, only assigning values to
   successful query-response pairs.

   Percentile -- for the conditional distribution of all packets with a
   valid value of Round-trip delay (undefined delays are excluded), a
   single value corresponding to the 95th percentile.

6.4.2.  Data Format

   <describe the data format for each type of result>

   Raw -- for each packet sent, pairs of values as follows:

   o  T, the time when the packet was sent from Src, 128-bit NTP Date
      Format, see section 6 of [RFC5905])

   o  dT, a value of Round-trip delay, format is *similar to* the 32-bit
      short NTP Time format in Section 6 of [RFC5905] and is as follows:
      the first 16 bits represent the *signed* integer number of

      seconds; the next 16 bits represent the fractional part of a
      second.

   o  dT is undefined when the packet is not received at Src in waiting
      time Tmxax seconds (need undefined code for no-response or un-
      successful response)

   Percentile -- for the conditional distribution of all packets with a
   valid value of Round-trip delay (undefined delays are excluded), a
   single value as follows:

   See section 4.1 of [RFC3393] for details on the conditional
   distribution to exclude undefined values of delay, and Section 5 of
   [RFC6703] for background on this analysis choice.

   See section 4.3 of [RFC3393] for details on the percentile statistic
   (where Round-trip delay should be substituted for "ipdv").

   The percentile = 95.

   Data format is a 32-bit signed floating point value, *similar to* the
   32-bit short NTP Time format in Section 6 of [RFC5905] and is as
   follows: the first 16 bits represent the *signed* integer number of
   seconds; the next 16 bits represent the fractional part of a second.

   [RFC7003] provides the reference information for this category.

9.2.1.  Reference Definition

   Packets Discarded in Bursts:

   The total number of packets discarded during discard bursts.  The
   measured value is unsigned value.  If the measured value exceeds
   0xFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFE MUST be reported to indicate an over-
   range measurement.  If the measurement is unavailable, the value
   0xFFFFFF MUST be reported.

9.2.2.  Fixed Parameters

   Fixed Parameters are input factors that must be determined and
   embedded in the measurement system for use when needed.  The values
   of these parameters is specified in the Registry.

   Threshold: 8 bits, set to value = 3 packets.

   The Threshold is equivalent to Gmin in [RFC3611], i.e., the number of
   successive packets that must not be discarded prior to and following
   a discard packet in order for this discarded packet to be regarded as
   part of a gap.  Note that the Threshold is set in accordance with the
   Gmin calculation defined in Section 4.7.2 of [RFC3611].

   Interval Metric flag: 2 bits, set to value 11=Cumulative Duration

   This field is used to indicate whether the burst/gap discard metrics
   are Sampled, Interval, or Cumulative metrics [RFC6792]:

Internet-Draft              Initial Registry                  March 2015


   I=10: Interval Duration - the reported value applies to the most
   recent measurement interval duration between successive metrics
   reports.

   I=11: Cumulative Duration - the reported value applies to the
   accumulation period characteristic of cumulative measurements.

   Senders MUST NOT use the values I=00 or I=01.

9.3.  Method of Measurement

   This category includes columns for references to relevant sections of
   the RFC(s) and any supplemental information needed to ensure an
   unambiguous methods for implementations.  For the Burst/Gap Discard
   Metric, it appears that the only guidance on methods of measurement
   is in Section 3.0 of [RFC7003] and its supporting references.
   Relevant information is repeated below, although there appears to be
   no section titled "Method of Measurement" in [RFC7003].

9.3.1.  Reference Method

   Metrics in this block report on burst/gap discard in the stream
   arriving at the RTP system.  Measurements of these metrics are made
   at the receiving end of the RTP stream.  Instances of this metrics
   block use the synchronization source (SSRC) to refer to the separate
   auxiliary Measurement Information Block [RFC6776], which describes
   measurement periods in use (see [RFC6776], Section 4.2).

   This metrics block relies on the measurement period in the
   Measurement Information Block indicating the span of the report.
   Senders MUST send this block in the same compound RTCP packet as the
   Measurement Information Block.  Receivers MUST verify that the
   measurement period is received in the same compound RTCP packet as
   this metrics block.  If not, this metrics block MUST be discarded.

9.3.2.  Stream Type and Stream Parameters

   Since RTCP-XR Measurements are conducted on live RTP traffic, the
   complete description of the stream is contained in SDP messages that
   proceed the establishment of a compatible stream between two or more
   communicating hosts.  See Run-time Parameters, below.

9.3.3.  Output Type and Data Format

   The output type defines the type of result that the metric produces.

   o  Data Format: 24 bits

   o  Reference: Section 3.2 of [RFC7003]

9.3.4.  Metric Units

   The measured results are apparently expressed in packets, although
   there is no section of [RFC7003] titled "Metric Units".

9.3.5.  Run-time Parameters and Data Format

   Run-Time Parameters are input factors that must be determined,
   configured into the measurement system, and reported with the results
   for the context to be complete.  However, the values of these
   parameters is not specified in the Registry, rather these parameters
   are listed as an aid to the measurement system implementor or user
   (they must be left as variables, and supplied on execution).

   The Data Format of each Run-time Parameter SHALL be specified in this
   column, to simplify the control and implementation of measurement
   devices.

   SSRC of Source: 32 bits As defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC3611].

   SDP Parameters: As defined in [RFC4566]

12.  Acknowledgements

   The authors thank Brian Trammell for suggesting the term "Run-time
   Parameters", which led to the distinction between run-time and fixed
   parameters implemented in this memo, for raising the IPFIX metric
   with Flow Key as an example, and for many other productive
   suggestions.Thanks to Peter Koch, who provided several useful
   suggestions for disambiguating successive DNS Queries in the DNS
   Response time metric.
