1. Introduction

   CoAP is a web application protocol designed for resource constrained
   devices and limited networks that has been widely used in machine-
   to-machine (M2M) communications [RFC7252]. However, the purpose of
   applying CoAP to the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is to
   provide connectivity for the devices. Whereas the communication of
   Industry 4.0 is not only based on data transmission, but also based
   on semantic information exchange. Driven by this, using CoAP in the
   IIoT, there is a need to provide good support for data transmission
   of the application layer in the automation field. According to the
   definition of Industry 4.0 for communication, CoAP needs to support
   the exchange of semantic information, namely the semantic
   information model. For the current protocols supporting semantic
   information model in the IIoT, the information model defined by OPC
   UA [IEC 62541-1] is very promising and its transmission mode is

   similar to the transmission mode of CoAP, so it can be applied as a
   branch of the CoAP message payload.

2. Architecture of OPC UA over CoAP

   With the vision of IIoT in mind, we believe that the architecture of
   OPC UA over CoAP can be mainly divided into the following two:

   1) Figure 1 presents a logical layered structure of OPC UA
   Information Model over CoAP. In the transport layer, DTLS runs on
   top of UDP to secure transmission. Then, the middle layer utilizes
   the message mode defined in the CoAP protocol. Last, the information
   model of OPC UA [IEC TR 62541-5] is defined as an application of
   CoAP at the top. In such a hierarchical structure, the semantic-
   based data information in OPC UA can be transmitted in restricted
   scenarios, so that CoAP can meet the requirements of semantic
   information transmission.

transmission over CoAP. As shown in Figure 2, the information model of
OPC UA is defined as the application of CoAP, moreover, the connection
establishment, creation session, publish/subscribe and other functions
related to data information interaction are all implemented by the
service set defined by OPC UA. CoAP is mainly responsible for the
definition of message format and runs over UDP to keep the
implementation lightweight.

3. Requirements for OPC UA over CoAP

3.1. Encoding

   CoAP messages are encoded in a simple binary format that starts with
   a fixed-size 4-byte header. The header is followed by a variable-
   length Token value, which can be between 0 and 8 bytes long.
   Following the Token value comes a sequence of zero or more CoAP
   Options in Type-Length-Value (TLV) format, optionally followed by a
   payload that takes up the rest of the datagram. In addition, the OPC
   UA protocol coding mainly includes two ways that are binary and XML.
   Therefore, in order to transmit the information model of OPC UA over
   CoAP, specific frame formats of CoAP need to be designed to support
   two kinds of coding modes of OPC UA.

3.2. Application Sublayer Optimization

   For information exchange, the document [draft-ietf-core-coap-pubsub-
   00] defines the corresponding application sublayer, OPC UA also
   defines a number of specific communication patterns. For example, in
   the publish/subscribe mode defined by OPC UA, when the client needs
   to obtain a data periodically, it will initiate a subscription
   request to the server. In addition, the server will send the data to
   the client periodically as it receives the request from the client
   successfully. Correspondingly, in the publish/subscribe
   specification of CoAP, it introduces Broker mechanism in which the
   client sends the state information to the Broker and the Broker
   provides storage and forwarding function to implement the
   publish/subscribe function. Comparing above two protocols, their
   achieving methods have a difference on communication mode of the
   publish/subscribe function. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize
   the application sublayer of CoAP to support some particular
   communication modes of OPC UA.

3.3. Consistency

   The interactive model of CoAP is the client/server model. However,
   in M2M scenarios, CoAP entities often act as both servers and
   clients. Comparing to OPC UA, though the interactive model is also


 Wang, et al.             Expires July 1, 2017                 [Page 4]

 Internet-Draft              OPC UA Over CoAP             December 2016


   the client/server model, there is a set of supported services in the
   OPC UA server. Consequently, for the great difference of the server
   definition of these two protocols, we need to tackle with the
   consistency and integration issues between the CoAP server and the
   OPC UA server.

3.4. Reliability

   One of the main design goals of CoAP is to satisfy some special
   requirements such as communication in the constrained scenarios that
   address power consumption. Hence, in order to reduce network
   overhead and avoid network congestion, CoAP is designed to run over
   UDP, which is a good choice to achieve inter-network data
   transmissions in use of the IP architecture. However, UDP is a
   connectionless transport layer protocol that provides unreliable
   information transmission services. In the field of IIoT, we need to
   ensure the reliability of data transmission to avoid losing some
   important data information. Moreover, CoAP addresses transmission
   reliability by defining a message as requiring acknowledgment,
   obviously this is not enough to meet the high reliability
   requirements in the field of IIoT, so the reliability of COAP
   remains to be optimized.

4. Security Considerations

   The security of CoAP includes four modes in which three modes
   implemented based on the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
   except the non-security mode. However, the security architecture of
   OPC UA is built on the application layer and the communication layer
   above the transport layer. Specifically, the application layer
   adopts the authentication and authorization and the communication
   layer achieves the security of OPC UA [IEC TR 62541-2] through
   secure channel encryption. Though OPC UA has four modes, the
   security model of OPC UA is realized based on Transport Layer
   Security (TLS). Actually, DTLS is an addition to TLS to solve the
   unreliable transmission feature of UDP. Currently, some documents
   show that CoAP needs to support TLS. Therefore, the security of the
   two protocols can be implemented jointly.

5. IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.
