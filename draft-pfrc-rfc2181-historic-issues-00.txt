                   draft-pfrc-rfc2181-historic-issues-00
Abstract

   RFC 2181 is an amalgamation of eight independent components that were 
   lumped together into a single document, ostensibly because none were of
   enough interest to create a standalone reference for each idea.  After 
   nearly two decades, and a number of RFCs that update portions of RFC 2181,
   it seems reasonable to move RFC 2181 to historic status and focus on each
   idea independentally.  This document introduces eight standalone docuements,
   one for each of the ideas collected in RFC 2181 and allows for examination
   of each idea independently.   In doing so, this document moves RFC 2181
   to historic status.

1  Introduction

   [RFC2181] discusses eight independent protocol specification ambiguities 
   and suggests normalized or clarified responses to resolve the concerns
   and lead to better interoperablity for the servers and resolvers using the
   Internet's domain name system (DNS) protocol [RFC1035].  Since its publication, 
   both protocol and operational considerations have evolved.  It makes more 
   sense now to separate the eight items into separate documents.  The eight
   elements requirements are defined in [DRAFT001-008] and are taken verbatum 
   from [RFC2181].  This document introduces these new specifications.
   
2  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

3   RFC 2181 as Historic

   This document obsoletes and reclassifies [RFC2181] as Historic.

   This document and [DRAFT001-008] together functionally replace
   [RFC2181].

4  Security Considerations

   It is not believed that anything in this document adds to any
   security issues that may exist with the DNS, nor does it do anything
   to that will necessarily lessen them.  Correct implementation of the
   DNS specifications might play some small part in a robust, reliable 
   naming system, but as with all tools, they are intrinsically neutral.
   Security is always in the perception of the beholder.

5   IANA Considerations

   This document has no action for IANA.
