  <p class="title">Media Type Specifications and Registration Procedures <br />
  <span class="filename">draft-freed-media-type-regs-00</span></p>
  
  <h1 id="rfc.abstract"><a href="#rfc.abstract">Abstract</a></h1>
<p>This document defines procedures for the specification and registration of media types for use in MIME and other Internet protocols.  </p>
<h1><a>Historical Note</a></h1>
<p>The media type registration process was initially defined for registering media types for use in the context of the asynchronous Internet mail environment. In this mail environment there is a need to limit the number of possible media types, to increase the likelihood of interoperability when the capabilities of the remote mail system are not known.  As media types are used in new environments in which the proliferation of media types is not a hindrance to interoperability, the original procedure proved excessively restrictive and had to be generalized. This was initially done in <a href="#RFC2048">[RFC2048]</a>, but the procedure defined there was still part of the MIME document set. The media type specification and registration procedure has now been moved to this separate document, to make it clear that it is independent of MIME.  </p>
<p>It may be desirable to restrict the use of media types to specific environments or to prohibit their use in other environments. This revision attempts for the first time to incorporate such restrictions into media type registrations in a systematic way.  See <a href="#UsageImpReqs">Section 4.9</a> for additional discussion.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.2">Type and subtype names beginning with "X-" are reserved for experimental use and MUST NOT be registered. This parallels the restriction on the x. tree, as discussed in <a href="#XDotTree">Section 3.4</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.3">Type and subtype names MUST conform to the following ABNF: </p>

A "charset" parameter MAY be used to indicate the charset of the body text for "text" subtypes, notably including the subtype "text/plain", which is a generic subtype for plain text defined in <a href="#RFC2046">[RFC2046]</a>. If defined, a text "charset" parameter MUST be used to specify a charset name defined in accordance to the procedures laid out in <a href="#RFC2978">[RFC2978]</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.1.p.2">Plain text does not provide for or allow formatting commands, font attribute specifications, processing instructions, interpretation directives, or content markup.  Plain text is seen simply as a linear sequence of characters, possibly interrupted by line breaks or page breaks.  Plain text MAY allow the stacking of several characters in the same position in the text.  Plain text in scripts like Arabic and Hebrew may also include facilities that allow the arbitrary mixing of text segments with opposite writing directions.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.1.p.3">Beyond plain text, there are many formats for representing what might be known as "rich text".  An interesting characteristic of many such representations is that they are to some extent readable even without the software that interprets them.  It is useful to distinguish them, at the highest level, from such unreadable data as images, audio, or text represented in an unreadable form.  In the absence of appropriate interpretation software, it is reasonable to present subtypes of "text" to the user, while it is not reasonable to do so with most non-textual data.

Expected uses for the "application" media type include but are not limited to file transfer, spreadsheets, presentations, scheduling data, and languages for "active" (computational) material.  (The latter, in particular, can pose security problems that must be understood by implementors, and are considered in detail in the discussion of the "application/PostScript" media type in <a href="#RFC2046">[RFC2046]</a>.) </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.5.p.2">For example, a meeting scheduler might define a standard representation for information about proposed meeting dates.  An intelligent user agent would use this information to conduct a dialog with the user, and might then send additional material based on that dialog.  More generally, there have been several "active" languages developed in which programs in a suitably specialized language are transported to a remote location and automatically run in the recipient's environment.  Such applications may be defined as subtypes of the "application" media type.  </p>

<li>All registrations MUST state whether or not they employ such "active content", and if they do, they MUST state what steps have been taken to protect users of the media type from harm.  </li>
<li>Complex media types may include provisions for directives that institute actions that, while not directly harmful to the recipient, may result in disclosure of information that either facilitates a subsequent attack or else violates a recipient's privacy in some way.  Again, the registration of the application/postscript media type illustrates how such directives can be handled.  </li>
<li>A media type that employs compression may provide an opportunity for sending a small amount of data that, when received and evaluated, expands enormously to consume all of the recipient's resources. All media types SHOULD state whether or not they employ compression, and if they do they should discuss what steps need to be taken to avoid such attacks.  </li>
<li>A media type might be targeted for applications that require some sort of security assurance but not provide the necessary security mechanisms themselves. For example, a media type could be defined for storage of confidential medical information that in turn requires an external confidentiality service, or which is designed for use only within a secure environment.  </li>

<p id="rfc.section.4.8.p.2">It is therefore useful to note what sort of data a media type can consist of as part of its registration. An "encoding considerations" field is provided for this purpose. Possible values of this field are: </p>

<dl>
<dt>7bit:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The content of the media type consists solely of CRLF-delimited 7bit US-ASCII text.  </dd>
<dt>8bit:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The content of the media type consists solely of CRLF-delimited 8bit text.  </dd>
<dt>binary:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The content consists of unrestricted sequence of octets.  </dd>
<dt>framed:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The content consists of a series of frames or packets without internal framing or alignment indicators. Additional out-of-band information is needed to interpret the data properly, including but not necessarily limited to, knowledge of the boundaries between successive frames and knowledge of the transport mechanism. Note that media types of this sort cannot simply be stored in a file or transported as a simple stream of octets; therefore, such media types are unsuitable for use in many traditional protocols.  A commonly used transport with framed encoding is the Real-time Transport Protocol, RTP.  Additional rules for framed encodings defined for transport using RTP are given in <a href="#RFC3555">[RFC3555]</a>.  </dd>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.9.p.1">In the asynchronous mail environment, where information on the capabilities of the remote mail agent is frequently not available to the sender, maximum interoperability is attained by restricting the media types used to those "common" formats expected to be widely implemented.  This was asserted in the past as a reason to limit the number of possible media types, and resulted in a registration process with a significant hurdle and delay for those registering media types.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.9.p.2">However, the need for "common" media types does not require limiting the registration of new media types. If a limited set of media types is recommended for a particular application, that should be asserted by a separate applicability statement specific for the application and/or environment.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.9.p.3">Therefore, universal support and implementation of a media type is NOT a requirement for registration.  However, if a media type is explicitly intended for limited use, this MUST be noted in its registration. The "Restrictions on Usage" field is provided for this purpose.  </p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.10.p.1">Proposals for media types registered in the standards tree by the IETF itself MUST be published as RFCs. RFC publication of vendor and personal media type proposals is encouraged but not required. In all cases the IANA will retain copies of all media type proposals and "publish" them as part of the media types registration tree itself.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.10.p.2">As stated previously, standards tree registrations for media types defined in documents produced by other standards bodies MUST be described by a formal standards specification produced by that body. Such specifications MUST contain an appropriate media type registration template taken from <a href="#MediaTypeRegTemplate">Section 4.12.9</a>. Additionally, the copyright on the registration template MUST allow the IANA to copy it into the IANA registry.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.10.p.3">Other than IETF registrations in the standards tree, the registration of a data type does not imply endorsement, approval, or recommendation by the IANA or the IETF or even certification that the specification is adequate.  To become Internet Standards, a protocol or data object must go through the IETF standards process.  This is too difficult and too lengthy a process for the convenient registration of media types.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.10.p.4">The standards tree exists for media types that do require a substantive review and approval process in a recognized standards body.  The vendor and personal trees exist for those media types that do not require such a process. It is expected that applicability statements for particular applications will be published from time to time in the IETF, recommending implementation of, and support for, media types that have proven particularly useful in those contexts.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.10.p.5">As discussed above, registration of a top-level type requires standards-track processing in the IETF and, hence, RFC publication.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.11.p.1">Various sorts of optional information SHOULD be included in the specification of a media type if it is available: </p>

<ul>
<li>Magic number(s) (length, octet values). Magic numbers are byte sequences that are always present at a given place in the file and thus can be used to identify entities as being of a given media type.  </li>
<li>File name extension(s) commonly used on one or more platforms to indicate that some file contains a given media type.  </li>
<li>Mac OS File Type code(s) (4 octets) used to label files containing a given media type.  </li>
<li>Information about how fragment/anchor identifiers <a href="#RFC3986">[RFC3986]</a> are constructed for use in conjunction with this media type.  </li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.11.p.2">In the case of a registration in the standards tree, this additional information MAY be provided in the formal specification of the media type. It is suggested that this be done by incorporating the IANA media type registration form into the specification itself.  </p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.p.1">A number of media types with unfaceted names, registered prior to 1996, would, if registered under the guidelines in this document, be given a faceted name and placed into either the vendor or personal trees.  Reregistration of those types to reflect the appropriate trees is encouraged but not required.   Ownership and change control principles outlined in this document apply to those types as if they had been registered in the trees described above.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.Appendix A.p.2">From time to time there may also be cases where a media type with an unfaceted name has been widely deployed without being registered. If possible such types SHOULD be reregistered with a proper faceted name. However, if this is not possible the type can, subject to approval by both the media types reviewer and the IESG, be registered in the proper tree with its unfaceted name.  </p>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Suffixes to indicate the use of a particular structured syntax are now fully specified and a suffix registration process has been defined.  </li>
<li>Registration of widely deployed unregistered unfaceted type names in the vendor or personal trees is now allowed, subject to approval by the media types reviewer and the IESG.  </li>
<li>The standards tree registration process has been revised to include Expert Review and generalized to address cases like media types in non-IETF stream documents.  </li>
<li>A field for fragment/anchor identifiers has been added to the registration template.  </li>
