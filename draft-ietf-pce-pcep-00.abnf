Notification-value=1: PCC cancels a set of pending request(s) 
      
           A Notification-type=1, Notification-value=1 indicates that the 
           PCC wants to inform a PCE of the cancellation of a set of 
           pending request(s). Such event could be triggered because of 
           external conditions such as the receipt of a positive reply from 
           another PCE (should the PCC have sent multiple requests to a set 
           of PCEs for the same path computation request), a network event 
           such as a network failure rendering the request obsolete or any 
           other event(s) local to the PCC. A NOTIFICATION object with 
Notification-type=1, Notification-value=1 is exclusively carried 
Notification-value=2: PCE cancels a set of pending request(s) 
      
           A Notification-type=1, Notification-value=2 indicates that the 
           PCE wants to inform a PCC of the cancellation of a set of 
           pending request(s). Such event could be triggered because of 
           some PCE congested state or because of some path computation 
           requests that are part the set of synchronized path computation 
      
       
           requests are missing. A NOTIFICATION object with Notification-
type=1, Notification-value=2 is exclusively carried within a 
Notification-type=2: PCE congestion 
        
Notification-value=1 
        
           A Notification-type=2, Notification-value=1 indicates to the 
           PCC(s) that the PCE is currently in a congested state. If no RP 
           objects are comprised in the PCNtf message, this indicates that 
           no other requests SHOULD be sent to that PCE until the congested 
           state is cleared: the pending requests are not affected and will 
           be served. If some pending requests cannot be served due to the 
           congested state, the PCE MUST also include a set of RP object(s) 
           that identifies the set of pending requests which will not be 
           honored and which will be cancelled by the PCE. In this case, 
           the PCE does not have to send an additional PCNtf message with 
Notification-type=1 and Notification-value=2 since the list of 
Notification-value=2 
        
           A Notification-type=2, Notification-value=2 indicates that the 
           PCE is no longer in congested state and is available to process 
           new path computation requests. An implementation MUST make sure 
           that a PCE sends such notification to every PCC to which a 
           Notification message (with Notification-type=2, Notification-
