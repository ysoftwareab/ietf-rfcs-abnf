             The PKCS #8 EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo Media Type
                    draft-seantek-pkcs8-encrypted-00

Abstract

   This document registers the application/pkcs8-encrypted media type
   for use with the EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo unit of PKCS #8. This format
   carries an encrypted private key.

Internet-Draft        PKCS #8 Encrypted Media Type            March 2016


1. Definitions

   The key word "SHOULD" in this document is to be interpreted as
   described in [RFC2119].

2. Registration Application

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: pkcs8-encrypted

   Required parameters: None.

   Optional parameters:

    password-mapping: When the encryption algorithm incorporates a
     "password" that is an octet string, a mapping between user input
     and the octet string is desirable. PKCS #5 [RFC2898] Section 3
     recommends "that applications follow some common text encoding
     rules"; it then suggests, but does not recommend, ASCII and UTF-8.
     This parameter specifies the charset that a recipient SHOULD
     attempt first when mapping user input to the octet string. This
     parameter is not cryptographically protected, so recipients SHOULD
     NOT rely on it as the exclusive mapping possibility.

     This parameter has similar semantics as the charset parameter from
     text/plain, except that it only applies to the user's input of a
     password. There is no default value.

     The following special values are defined:
     *pkcs12     = UTF-16LE with U+0000 NULL terminator (PKCS #12-style,
                   see [RFC7292])
     *precis     = PRECIS password profile, i.e., OpaqueString from
                   Section 4 of [RFC7613] (always UTF-8)
     *precis-XXX = PRECIS profile as named XXX in the IANA PRECIS
                   Profiles Registry
     *hex        = hexadecimal input: the input is mapped to 0-9, A-F,
                   and then converted directly to octets. If there are
                   an odd number of hex digits, either the final digit 0
                   is appended, or an error condition is raised. Compare
                   with Annex M.4 of IEEE 802.11-2012.
     *dtmf       = The characters "0"-"9", "A"-"D", "*", and "#", which
                   map to their corresponding ASCII codes. "A"-"D" map
                   to the uppercase range 0x41 - 0x44. (This is to
                   support restricted-input devices, i.e., telephones
                   and telephone-like equipment.) User input outside of
                   these values is either ignored, or an error condition
                   is raised.

     Otherwise, the value of this parameter is a charset, from the IANA
     Character Sets Registry [RFC2978].

     This parameter is case-insensitive.
   Encoding considerations: Binary.

   Security considerations:

     Carries a cryptographic private key. See Section 6 of [RFC5958].

     EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo PKCS #8 data contains exactly one private
     key. Poor password choices, weak algorithms, or improper parameter
     selections (e.g., insufficient salting rounds) will make the
     confidential payloads much easier to compromise.

   Interoperability considerations:

     PKCS #8 is a widely recognized format for private key information
     on all modern cryptographic stacks. The encrypted variation in this
     registration, EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo (Section 3, Encrypted Private
     Key Info, of [RFC5958], and Section 6 of PKCS #8), is less widely
     used for exchange than PKCS #12, but it is much simpler to
     implement. The contents are exactly one private key (with optional
     attributes), so the possibility for hidden "easter eggs" in the
     payload such as unexpected certificates or miscellaneous secrets is
     drastically reduced.

   Published specification:

   PKCS #8 v1.2, November 1993 (republished as RFC 5208, May 2008); RFC
   5958, August 2010

   Applications that use this media type:

     Machines, applications, browsers, Internet kiosks, and so on, that
     support this standard allow a user to import, export, and exercise
     a single private key.

   Fragment identifier considerations: None.

   Additional information:

     Deprecated alias names for this type: N/A
     Magic number(s): None.
     File extension(s): .p8e
     Macintosh file type code(s):
       None. A uniform type identifier (UTI) of
       "com.rsa.pkcs-8-encrypted" is RECOMMENDED.
