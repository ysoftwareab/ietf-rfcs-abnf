1.  Introduction

   OpenAPI [oas] version 3 and above is a consolidated standard for
   describing HTTP APIs using the JSON [JSON] and yaml [yaml] data
   format.

   To increase interoperability when processing API specifications and
   leverage content negotiation mechanisms when exchanging OpenAPI
   resources this specification register the following media-types:
   text/yaml, application/yaml, application/openapi+json and
   application/openapi+yaml.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.  These words may also appear in this
   document in lower case as plain English words, absent their normative
   meanings.

   This document uses the Augmented BNF defined in [RFC5234] and updated
   by [RFC7405].

1.2.  The OpenAPI Media Types

   The OpenAPI Media Types convey OpenAPI specification files as defined
   in [oas] for version 3.0.0 and above.

   Those files can be serialized in JSON or [yaml].  Since there are
   multiple OpenAPI Specifications versions, those media-types support
   the version parameter.

   The following examples conveys the desire of a client to receive an
   OpenAPI resource preferably in the following order:

   1.  openapi 3.1 in yaml

   2.  openapi 3.0 in yaml

   3.  any openapi version in json

   Accept: application/openapi+yaml;version=3.1,
           application/openapi+yaml;version=3.0;q=0.5,
           application/openapi+json;q=0.3

2.  Security Considerations

   Security requirements for both media type and media type suffix
   registrations are discussed in Section 4.6 of [MEDIATYPE].

3.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines the following new Internet media types
   [MEDIATYPE].

FAQ

   Q: Why this document?  After all these years, we still lack a proper
      media-type for yaml.  This has some security implications too (eg.
      wrt on identifying parsers or treat downloads)

   Q: Why application/yaml and text/yaml  Browsers and libraries
      implementations treats them differently.  For example Google
      Chrome will display pages with Content-Type: text/yaml and to
      download pages with Content-Type: application/yaml.
