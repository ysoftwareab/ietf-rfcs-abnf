                      draft-ietf-bess-evpn-yang-00

Abstract

   This document describes a YANG data model for Ethernet VPN services.
   The model is agnostic of the underlay. It apply to MPLS as well as to
   VxLAN encapsulation. The model is also agnostic of the services
   including E-LAN, E-LINE and E-TREE services. Any "add-on" features
   such as EVPN IRB, EVPN overlay, etc. are for future investigation.
   This document mainly focuses on EVPN and Ethernet-Segment instance
   framework.

Internet-Draft            draft-bess-evpn-yang             June 23, 2016


1.  Introduction

   The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) [RFC6241] is a network
   management protocol that defines mechanisms to manage network
   devices. YANG [RFC6020] is a modular language that represents data
   structures in an XML or JSON tree format, and is used as a data
   modeling language for the NETCONF.

   This document introduces a YANG data model for Ethernet VPN services
   (EVPN) [RFC7432], Provider Backbone Bridging Combined with Ethernet
   VPN (PBB-EVPN) [RFC7623] as well as other WG draft such as EVPN-VPWS,
   etc...  The EVPN services runs over MPLS and VxLAN underlay.

   The Yang data model in this document defines Ethernet VPN based
   services.  The model will leverage the definitions used in other IETF
   Yang draft such as L2VPN Yang.

   The goal is to propose a data object model consisting of building
   blocks that can be assembled in different order to realize different
   services. The definition work is undertaken initially by a smaller
   working group with members representing various vendors and service
   providers.  The EVPN basic framework consist of two modules: EVPN and
   Ethernet-Segment. These models are completely orthogonal. They
   usually work in pair but user can definitely use one or the other for
   its own need.

   The data model is defined for following constructs that are used for
   managing the services:

      o  Configuration

      o  Operational State

      o  Executables (Actions)

      o  Notifications

   The document is organized to first define the data model for the
   configuration, operational state, actions and notifications of EVPN
   and Ethernet-Segment.

   The EVPN data object model defined in this document uses the instance
   centric approach whereby EVPN service attributes are specified for a
   given EVPN instance.

   The Ethernet-Segment data object model defined in this document refer
   to a specific  interface. That interface can be a physical interface,
   a bundle interface or virtual interface. The latter includes

   pseudowires. The purpose of creating a separate module is due to the
   fact that it can be used without having the need to have EVPN
   configured in layer 2 service. For example, an access node can be
   dual-homed to two service nodes servicing a VPLS core. The access
   connectivity can be represented by an Ethernet-Segment where EVPN BGP
   DF election is performed over both service nodes. The core remains
   VPLS. and no EVPN instance is being used here.

2. Specification of Requirements

      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT",   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
   in this   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3. EVPN YANG Model

3.1.  Overview

      Two top level module, Ethernet-Segment and EVPN, are defined. The
   Ethernet-Segment contains a list of interface to which any Ethernet-
   Segment attributes are configured/applied.

      The EVPN module has 2 main containers: common and instance. The
   first one has common attributes to all VPNs where as the latter has
   attributes specific to an EVI. This document state the scope of the
   EVPN object models definition. The following documents are within the
   scope. This is not an exhaustive list but a representation of
   documents that are covered for this work:


      o   Requirements for EVPN: RFC 7209
      o   EVPN: RFC 7432
      o   PBB-EVPN: RFC 7623

   The integration with L2VPN instance Yang model is left for future
   study. Following documents will be covered at that time:
      o   VPWS support in EVPN:  
      draft-ietf-bess-evpn-vpws-00
      o   E-TREE Support in EVPN & PBB-EVPN:
      draft-ietf-bess-evpn-etree-02
      o   (PBB-)EVPN Seamless Integration with (PBB-)VPLS:

      o   EVPN Virtual Ethernet Segment:
      draft-sajassi-bess-evpn-virtual-eth-segment-00

   The VxLAN aspect and the work related to Layer 3 is also for future
   definition. Following documents will be covered at that time:

3.2 Ethernet-Segment Model

   The Ethernet-Segment data model has a list of ES where each refer to
   an interface. All attributes are optional due to auto-sensing default
   mode where all values are auto-derive from the network connectivity.

   module: ietf-ethernet-segment
      +--rw ethernet-segments
         +--rw ethernet-segment* [name]
            +--rw name                  string
            +--rw esi?                  empty
            +--rw (active-mode)
            |  +--:(single-active)
            |  |  +--rw single-active-mode?   empty
            |  +--:(all-active)
            |     +--rw all-active-mode?      empty
            +--rw bgp-parameters
            |  +--rw common
            |     +--rw route-distinguisher?   string
            |     +--rw vpn-targets* [rt-value]
            |        +--rw rt-value    string
            |        +--rw rt-type     bgp-rt-type
            +--rw df-election
               +--rw (df-election-method)?
               |  +--:(highest-random-weight)
               |     +--rw enable-hrw?           empty
               +--rw election-wait-time?   uint32

3.3 EVPN Model

      The evpn-instances container contains a list of evpn-instance.
   Each entry of the evpn-instance represents a different Ethernet VPN
   and it is represented by a EVI. Again, mainly all attributes are
   optional for the same reason as for the ethernet-segment module.

   module: ietf-evpn
      +--rw evpn

5. Security Considerations

      The configuration, state, action and notification data defined in
   this document are designed to be accessed via the NETCONF protocol
   [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer
   and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is SSH [RFC6242]. The
   NETCONF access control model [RFC6536] provides means to restrict

   access for particular NETCONF users to a pre-configured subset of all
   available NETCONF protocol operations and content.

      The security concerns listed above are, however, no different than
   faced by other routing protocols. Hence, this draft does not change
   any underlying security issues inherent in [I-D.ietf-netmod-routing-
   cfg]

6. IANA Considerations

      None.
