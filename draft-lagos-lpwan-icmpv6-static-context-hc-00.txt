       LPWAN Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) for ICMPv6
             draft-lagos-lpwan-icmpv6-static-context-hc-00

Abstract

   This document provides the implementation of the LPWAN static context
   header compression (SCHC) for the Internet Control Message Protocol
   version 6 (ICMPv6) on networks with star topology.  SCHC is a header
   compression technique which uses RoHC concepts and the flexibility of
   6LoWPAN to avoid fields that are known by all network devices and
   compress the remaining header fields.  The ICMPv6 messages considered
   in this draft are Echo Request, Echo Reply and Neighbor Discovery.

1.  Introduction

   LPWANs are networks where low power consumption, high delay and
   extremely small packets characterize the traffic.  The nodes are
   tipically connected in a star topology, with a central gateway that
   connects the network to the Internet.  Most IP-based networks require
   ICMP services to enable network configuration and testing, such as
   neighbor node detection and round trip time calculation.  Because
   ICMPv6 has redundant information in header fields, SCHC can be
   deployed efficiently, especially for LPWA devices that are
   constrained by a small available bandwidth and power limitations.

   This document describes ICMPv6 message compression using SCHC
   compression defined on [I-D.toutain-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc] to
   reduce to the minimum the required LPWAN packet size.  In order to
   achieve this goal, we also reuse the Rule ID field by redefining the
   bit usage without loss in compatibility.

2.  Building SCHC rule for ICMPv6

   The SCHC rule is set up with one 1 Byte where the 8 bits will be
   referenced by the letters A B C D E F G H.

   +-------+------+----------------------------------------------------+
   | Field | bits | Values                                             |
   +-------+------+----------------------------------------------------+
   | A     | 1    | 0: If the Next Header field is ICMPv6, 1: If Next  |
   |       |      | Header field is UDP                                |
   |       |      |                                                    |

   +-------+------+----------------------------------------------------+

   If the A field is ICMPv6, DEFGH will be set with the following
   configuration:

3.  SCHC compression over Echo Request - Echo Reply

   Echo Request and Echo Reply are composed by the same fields:

   o  Type: Message type.  In case it is Echo Request the value will be
      0x80.  If it is Echo Reply will be 0x81.
   o  Code: Always 0.
   o  Checksum: This field is composed by 2 Bytes where the values are
      calculated as defined on RFC 4443 [RFC4443].
   o  Identifier: It is the ID of the package.
   o  Sequence: It is the sequence number of the transmitted packet.

   For a SCHC compression it is necessary to identify which fields stay
   static to build the context.

   The fields Code and checksum can be elided because Code is always
   zero and Checksum can be calculated after the decompression of the
   packet.  In the case of Type, this field can be represented in the
   SCHC rule.  The Identifier and Sequence fields will be sent after the
   SCHC rule.

4.  Router Solicitation SCHC compression

   The Router Solicitation packet header is composed by:

   o  Type: Type of message.  Value: 0x85.
   o  Code: Always 0.
   o  Checksum: This field is composed by 2 Bytes where the values are
      caculated as defined on RFC 4443 [RFC4443]
   o  Reserved: These 4 bytes have a 0 value.
   o  Option: This field corresponds to the MAC address.

Internet-Draft        lpwan-icmp-static-context-hc             June 2017


   The most significant field is the MAC address of the network host.
   As mentioned on RFC 4861 [RFC4861], Router Solicitation should have a
   Link-Local Source Address and a Router Multicast Address which can be
   integrated after the packet decompression.

5.  Router Advertisement SCHC compression

   The Router Advertisement packet header is composed by:

   o  Type: Type of message.  Value: 0x86.
   o  Code: Always 0.
   o  Checksum: This field is composed by 2 Bytes where they values are
      caculated as it is explained on RFC 4443 [RFC4443].
   o  Current Hop Limit: Because this is a star topology, the value MUST
      be set to 255.
   o  Autoconfig Flags: Depending on the router configuration, it will
      advertise if DHCP is allowed or not.
   o  Router Lifetime: This field indicates the time that the Router
      keeps the condition of default device.
   o  Reachable Time: Indicates to the host how much time a neighbour is
      considered reachable.
   o  Retransmission Timer: Indicates the delay that the host should
      have before transmission.
   o  Options: This field contains the MAC Address, MTU and the IPv6
      Prefix of the network.

   The SCHC compression for Router Advertisement is designed to send the
   MAC address of the packet.  Like the Echo message, the Type field can
   be represented in the SCHC rule.

   The Current Hop Limit, Autoconfig Flags, Lifetime Router, Reachable
   Time, and Retransmission Timer fields can be deleted if the host
   knows these values.  The MTU of this packet can be elided and the
   IPv6 prefix helps the SCHC compression of the global address,
   omitting the first 8 bytes of the address.

6.  SCHC compression over Neighbor Solicitation

   The Neighbor Solicitation packet header is composed by:

   o  Type: Type of message.  Value: 0x87.
   o  Code: Always 0.
   o  Checksum: This field is composed by 2 Bytes where the values are
      caculated as it is specified on RFC 4443 [RFC4443].
   o  Target Address: It contains the address to be resolved.
   o  Options: This field contains the MAC Address from the host.

   For SCHC compression over Neighbor Solicitation, the MAC address and
   the Target Address are the minimal fields for the transmision.  If
   the Target address has a Link-Local value, the last 8 Bytes of the
   address are sent, otherwise, the full 16 Bytes are sent.  The type
   field can be represented in the SCHC rule.

7.  SCHC compression over Neighbor Advertisement

   A Neighbor Advertisement is composed by:

   o  Type: Type of message.  Value: 0x88.
   o  Code: Is always 0.
   o  Checksum: This field is composed by 2 Bytes where the values are
      caculated as it is specified on RFC 4443 [RFC4443].
   o  Flags: Describes first if the device sending the packet is a
      router or a node, second if the packet is sent because it is a
      neighbor search response and third, if the receiver has to rewrite
      the host information.
   o  Target Address: If it is a reply of a Neighbor Solicitation
      request, it contains the same Target address, otherwise it will
      contain the address to be resolved.
   o  Options: If the packet source is a Multicast Neighbor Solicitation
      reply, the MAC is sent, otherwise it is elided.

   For the compression of SCHC in Neighbor Advertisement, the MAC
   address is sent if it is a Multicast neighborhood request response.
   If the Target address has a Link-Local value, the last 8 Bytes of the
   address will be sent, otherwise, the full 16 Bytes will be

   deleted.  The Type field can be represented in the SCHC rule.
