Internet-Draft          MLDv2 User Authentication              July 2007


1.  Introduction

   Currently commercial IP multicast services are not widely deployed
   and this is partly because of IP multicast model that enables non-
   secure, non-controlled way for end systems attached to a network to
   access multicast traffic.  Lack of accounting and access control in
   IP multicast makes it difficult for a service provider to generate
   enough revenue to sustain multicast services such as IP multicast-
   based Internet TV and mobile IP TV.

   Internet Protocol version 6 multicast membership control protocol
   MLDv2 runs in two parts: host and router [RFC3810].  MLDv2 currently
   does not support authentication of the user before any membership
   request is made by the host.

   Extensible authentication protocol (EAP) is run in a three-party
   authentication method [RFC3748] between the peer who is to be
   authenticated, the authenticator and the authentication server (AS)
   or Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) server.  In
   most cases, EAP methods generate keys that are used to secure the
   network access.

   Functional requirements related to the authentication, authorization
   and Accounting (AAA) for IP multicasting to be used in commercial
   services like content delivery services (CDS) have been stated in
   [I-D.ietf-mboned-maccnt-req].  For CDS, the end user must be
   authenticated for both the network access and content access.  A
   multi-domain AAA environment where the AAA server located in the
   network service provider (NSP) has to work with the AAA servers
   located in the content providers (CP) is needed.  Accounting
   information required to be collected includes joining and leaving the
   multicast group/channel activities, notifying the user when
   accounting really starts, and other information.  As a first step
   towards the solution, a framework for specifying the AAA capabilities
   for the deployment and operation of IP multicast services is being
   developed [I-D.ietf-mboned-multiaaa-framework].

   This document is intended to state the requirements on AAA in well
   managed IP multicasting services for mobile users accessing real-time
   content.  These are the requirements additional to those described in
   [I-D.ietf-mboned-maccnt-req] and the framework additional to the one
   described in [I-D.ietf-mboned-multiaaa-framework].  These
   requirements are expected to apply to SDOs such as WiMAX
   [WiMAX-NWG-Stage-2], [WiMAX-NWG-Stage-3].

   The document continues in Section 3 with a discussion on the
   architectural considerations and in Section 4 with the problem
   statement.

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document uses the definitions and abbreviations of
   [I-D.ietf-mboned-maccnt-req] and
   [I-D.ietf-mboned-multiaaa-framework].  Additional abbreviations are
   defined here.
   MS:  Mobile Station.
   BS:  Base Station.
   AR:  Access Router.
   DRM:  Digital Rights Management.
   PIM:  Protocol Independent Multicast.
   MLDv2:  Multicast Listener Discovery Protocol version 2.
   REK:  Right Encryption Key.
   EAP:  Extensible Authentication Protocol.
   HA:  Home Agent.



3.  Architectural Considerations

   In cellular networks, the mobile stations (MS) establish a cellular
   link to a base station (BS) which is connected to an IP entity called
   the access router (AR).  However, the multicast content is provided
   by the content providers and delivered using a multicast routing
   protocol.  The edge router is usually at the leaf of the multicast
   routing.

   Figure 1 shows the authentication architecture when no client or
   network based mobility management is used.

   The access router is in charge of the memberships to the multicast
   groups in the local access network and runs MLDv2 with MSs.

   The edge router runs multicast routing protocols such as Protocol
   Independent multicast (PIM) in the global Internet.  The access
   router also runs PIM but it is always a leaf node.

   At the network entry, MS joins a multicast group by running MLDv2
   with the access router.  Due to mobility, MS MAY leave the group
   anytime at this access router and MAY rejoin the group at a different
   access router.

   When EAP is used, the three parties of the authentication are MS as a
   supplicant, AR as an authenticator, and AAA server as an

   Figure 2 shows the authentication architecture when client or network
   based mobility management is used.

   When Client Mobile IP or Proxy Mobile IP is used, AR tunnels MS'
   traffic to the home agent.  MS joins multicast groups using its home
   address.  MLDv2 runs between MS and HA.  HA takes part in the
   multicast routing protocol.  MS mobility does not affect MLDv2
   operation and MS continues its membership with the multicast groups
   regardless of its mobility.

   When EAP is used, the three parties of the authentication are MS (AR
   in case of Proxy Mobile IP) as a supplicant, HA as an authenticator,
   and AAA server as an authentication server.

Internet-Draft          MLDv2 User Authentication              July 2007


4.  Problem Statement

4.1.  Identifying Multicast Users Issues

   IP multicast provides an efficient mechanism for delivering packets
   to multiple destinations.  However, IP multicast does not support
   user authentication, and provides by nature a non-secure, non-
   controlled way for users attached to a network to access multicast
   traffic.  Users can arbitrarily join and leave a multicast group at
   any time from anywhere.  Multicast sources are unable to know when a
   user joins or leaves a multicast group, or unable to know how many
   users on the network are receiving multicast traffic at a point of
   time.  Multicast network devices are unable to know whether a user is
   fully entitled to receive multicast traffic.

   Lack of information about service users and access control in this
   model makes it vulnerable to different types of attacks and also
   creates problems for a service provider to generate enough revenue.

4.2.  Authenticating Channel Issues

   There is a need for IP multicast-based services to identify users'
   privilege to access the corresponding contents when users login
   multicast-based services system.  However, sometimes it is necessary
   to identify once again users' privilege when the users have already
   logged in multicast-based services system.  For example, in the case
   of IPTV, some violent movies program of IPTV are not fit for young
   children.  But young children can watch these contents as long as
   they turn on TV and set-top box.  Therefore, there is indeed a need
   for IPTV system to provide the second-time authentication so that
   some special channels can be received.

4.3.  Accounting Issues

   In IP multicast communication with current standards (e.g., IGMPv3 or
   MLDv2) the multicast source transports its streaming media content to
   the multicast router.  Then, the multicast router replicates the data
   to any link which has at least one client requesting the information.
   In this process, no eligibility check is conducted. the multicast
   source and the multicast router do not know how many eligible and
   non-eligible clients are receiving information.  In other words, the
   current standards do not provide multicasting capabilities sufficient
   to meet the requirements of accounting.

4.4.  Mobile Multicasting Issues

   In the mobile IP multicast communication, users will access to the
   different multicast network.  There is a need for multicast network

Internet-Draft          MLDv2 User Authentication              July 2007


   to know whether a user is entitled to receive multicast traffic.

4.5.  EAP Method Issues

   EAP methods that do not generate keys MAY be preferred because as a
   result of authenticating the multicast user, a new key need not be
   generated.

   Since no key needs to be generated, key transport at the end of
   successful EAP method execution is not needed.  If the authentication
   fails, MLDv2 filter mode of the user MUST be set to EXCLUDE.

4.6.  Secure Multicasting Issues

   In some cases, for example, IPTV, content encryption scheme is used
   to achieve Digital Rights Management (DRM) purposes.  Legal users
   must register with the Key Server or Rights Issuer [RFC3740] to
   download the content keys and Right Encryption Key (REK) before they
   initiate the data stream service.

   An access control process is performed during each user's
   registration process with Rights Issuer/Key Server.  A user is
   authenticated and his/her authorization is checked to decide whether
   he/she has access to the keys.  Through the registration method,
   unauthorized users can be denied from seeing multicast content even
   if he/she gets the streaming data.  IETF MSEC working group has
   defined a number of RFCs on multicast key management ,
   [RFC3547][RFC3830] and [RFC4535].  They are used by some DRM
   specifications.

   Obviously, multicast content encryption scheme can be used to achieve
   multicast content access control.  It can also be used by Content
   Provider to learn the dynamic group membership for charging purpose.
   However, multicast content encryption can not prevent unauthorized
   access to the network.  Unauthorized users may abuse the NSP's
   network bandwith by joining multiple multicast groups through MLDv2
   even if they can not consume the multicast data.  Network-layer
   access control is still necessary even application level content
   encryption is used.  Two access control schemes will exist in
   multicast usage scenarios where DRM is required, e.g., IPTV.

   However, two separate access control schemes may adversely affect
   users' usage experience.  For example, a user may have to fill in
   duplicate user&password dialoges when consuming services, or have to
   separately transact with the Content Provider and NSP for charging
   issues.  Such things are both unnecessarily duplicate and unpleasant.

   On the other hand, the two access control systems are internally

   related.  Legal users of course should be able to pull down the
   multicast traffic if they are authorized access to the content
   encryption keys.  Vice versa.

   Thus, there is a need to unify the application level access control
   that is achieved by some DRM schemes and network multicast access
   control in those multicast usage scenarios where use of DRM is
   mandated.
