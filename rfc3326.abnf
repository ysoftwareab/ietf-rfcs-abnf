   The following values for the protocol field have been defined:

      SIP: The cause parameter contains a SIP status code.

      Q.850: The cause parameter contains an ITU-T Q.850 cause value
           in decimal representation.
   Examples are:

      Reason: SIP ;cause=200 ;text="Call completed elsewhere"
      Reason: Q.850 ;cause=16 ;text="Terminated"
      Reason: SIP ;cause=600 ;text="Busy Everywhere"
      Reason: SIP ;cause=580 ;text="Precondition Failure"

   Proxies generating a CANCEL request upon reception of a CANCEL from
   the previous hop that contains a Reason header field SHOULD copy it
   into the new CANCEL request.

   In normal SIP operation, a SIP status code in a response provides the
   client with information about the request that triggered the
   response, the session parameters, or the user.  For example, a 405
   (Method not allowed) response indicates that the request contained an
   unsupported method.  A 488 (Not Acceptable Here) indicates that the
   session parameters are unacceptable and a 486 (Busy Here) provides
   information about the status of the user.

   Any SIP status code MAY appear in the Reason header field of a
   request.  However, status codes that provide information about the
   user and about session parameters are typically useful for
   implementing services whereas status codes intended to report errors
   about a request are typically useful for debugging purposes.

   A SIP message MAY contain more than one Reason value (i.e., multiple
   Reason lines), but all of them MUST have different protocol values
   (e.g., one SIP and another Q.850).  An implementation is free to
   ignore Reason values that it does not understand.
