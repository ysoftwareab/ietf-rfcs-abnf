     Abstract 
         
        The purpose of this draft is to define a BGP-based auto-
        discovery mechanism for layer-1 VPNs. The auto-discovery 
        mechanism for l1vpns allows the provider network devices to 
        dynamically discover the set of PEs having ports attached to 
        CEs member of the same VPN. That information is necessary for 
        completing the signaling phase. One main objective of l1vpn 
        auto-discovery mechanism is to support "single-end 
        provisioning" model, where addition of a new port to a given 
        l1vpn would involve configuration changes only on the PE that 
        has this port and on the CE that is connected to the PE via 
        this port.

     1. Introduction 
         
         
        The purpose of this draft is to define a BGP-based auto-
        discovery mechanism for layer-1 VPNs. The auto-discovery 
        mechanism for l1vpns allows the provider network devices to 
        dynamically discover the set of PEs having ports attached to 
        CEs member of the same VPN. That information is necessary for 
        completing the signaling phase. One main objective of l1vpn 
        auto-discovery mechanism is to support "single-end 
        provisioning" model, where addition of a new port to a given 
        l1vpn would involve configuration changes only on the PE that 
        has this port and on the CE that is connected to the PE via 
        this port.  
         
        The auto-discovery mechanism proceeds by having a PE advertises 
        to other PEs, at a minimum, its own IP address and the list of 
        <private address, provider address> tuples local to that PE. 
        Once that information is received, the remote PEs will identify 
        the list of VPN members they have in common with the 
        advertising PE, and use the information carried within the 
        discovery mechanism to perform address resolution during 
        signaling phase.

        This version of the draft focuses on describing an auto-
        discovery mechanism for the basic mode only. Details for the 
        enhanced mode will be described in future revised version of 
        this draft.  
          
     2. Procedures 
         
        In the context of l1vpns, a CE is connected to a PE via one or 
        more ports, where each port may consists of one or more 
        channels or sub-channels. Each port on a CE that connects the 
        CE to a PE has an identifier that is unique within that l1vpn 
        (but need not be unique across several l1vpn). We refer to this 
        identifier as the customer port identifier (CPI). Each port on 
        a PE has as well an identifier that is unique within that 
        provider network. We refer to this identifier as the provider 
        port identifier (PPI). Note that IP addresses used for CPIs, 
        PPIs could be either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. 
      
        A PE maintains for each l1vpn configured on that PE a port 
        information tables (PIT) associated with each l1vpn that has at 
        least one port configured on a PE. A PIT contains a list of 
        <CPI, PPI> tuples for all the ports within its l1vpn. Note that 
        a PIT may as well hold routing information (for example when 
        CPIs are learnt using a routing protocol).  
         
      
        A PIT on a given PE is populated from two sources: the 
        information related to the CEs’ ports attached to the ports on 
        that PE (this information could be optionally received from the 
        CEs), and the information received from other PEs through the 
        auto-discovery mechanism. We’ll refer to the former as the 
        "local" information, and to the latter as the "remote" 
        information.  
         
        Propagation of local information to other PEs is accomplished 
        by using BGP multiprotocol extensions as specified in [BGP-VPN-
        AUTODISCOVERY]. To restrict the flow of this information to 
        only the PITs within a given l1vpn, we use BGP route filtering 
        based on the Route Target Extended Community [BGP-COMM], as 
        follows. 
         
        Each PIT on a PE is configured with one or more Route Target 
        Communities, called "export Route Targets", that are used for 
        tagging the local information when it is exported into 
        provider’s BGP. The granularity of such tagging could be as 
        fine as a single <CPI, PPI> pair. In addition, each PIT on a PE 
        is configured with one or more Route Target Communities, called 
        "import Route Targets", that restrict the set of routes that 
        could be imported from provider’s BGP into the PIT to only the 
        routes that have at least of these Communities.    
         
     Ould-Brahim et al.          October 2006                    [Page 3] 
     draft-ietf-l1vpn-bgp-auto-discovery-01.txt      October 2006 

        When a service provider adds a new l1vpn port to a particular 
        PE, this port is associated at provisioning time with a PIT on 
        that PE, and this PIT is associated (again at provisioning 
        time) with that l1vpn.  
         
        Note that since the protocol used to populate a PIT with remote 
        information is BGP, since BGP works across multiple routing 
        domains, it follows that the mechanisms described in this 
        document could support l1vpns that span multiple routing 
        domains.          
      
     3. Carrying l1vpn information in BGP 
      
        The <CPI, PPI> mapping is carried using the Multiprotocol 
        Extensions BGP [RFC2858]. [RFC2858] defines the format of two 
        BGP attributes, MP_REACH_NLRI and MP_UNREACH_NLRI that can be 
        used to announce and withdraw the announcement of reachability 
        information. We introduce a new a new subsequent address family 
        identifier (to be assigned by the IANA), and also a new NLRI 
        format for carrying the CPI and PPI information. 
         
        One or more <PPI, CPI> tuples could be carried in the above 
        mentioned BGP attributes.  
         
        The format of encoding a single <PPI, CPI> tuple is shown in  
        Figure 2 below: 
      
             +---------------------------------------+ 
             |     Length (1 octet)                  | 
             +---------------------------------------+ 
             |     PPI Length (1 octet)              | 
             +---------------------------------------+ 
             |     PPI (variable)                    | 
             +---------------------------------------+ 
             |     CPI AFI (2 octets)                | 
             +---------------------------------------+ 
             |     CPI (length)                      | 
             +---------------------------------------+ 
             |     CPI (variable)                    | 
             +---------------------------------------+

          The use and meaning of these fields are as follows: 
      
              Length:  
         
                 A one octet field whose value indicates the length of 
             the  <PPI, CPI> Information tuple in octets. 
      
      
              PPI Length:  
      
                A one octet field whose value indicates the length of  
     Ould-Brahim et al.          October 2006                    [Page 4] 
        draft-ietf-l1vpn-bgp-auto-discovery-01.txt      October 2006 

                of the PPI field 
      
              PPI field:  
      
                A variable length field that contains the value of  
                the PPI (either an address or <port index,  
                address> tuple  
      
              CPI AFI field:  
      
                A two octets field whose value indicates address  
                family of the CPI. 
      
              CPI Length:  
      
                A once octet field whose value indicates the  
                length of the CPI field. 
      
              CPI (variable):  
          
                A variable length field that contains the CPI  
                value (either an address or <port index, address>                
                tuple. 
      
        If the value of the Length of the Next Hop field is 4, then the 
        Next Hop contains an IPv4 address.  If this value is 16, then 
        the Next Hop contains an IPv6 address. 
      
     4. Carrying L1VPN Traffic Engineering Information in BGP 
      
        In addition to reachability information, the auto-discovery 
        mechanism may carry Traffic Engineering information that will be 
        used for signaling purposes. For example a PE may learn  
        from the remote PEs, the switching capability, the maximum LSP 
        bandwidth of the remote l1vpn interfaces. This document proposes 
        the use of the BGP attribute defined in [BGP-TE-ATTRIBUTE] to 
        carry such information. 
         
     5. Scalability 
         
        Recall that the Service Provider network consists of (a) PE, (b) 
        BGP Route Reflectors, (c) P nodes (which are neither PEs nor 
        Route Reflectors), and, in the case of multi-provider VPNs, (d) 
        ASBRs. 
         
        A PE router, unless it is a Route Reflector should not retain 
        L1VPN-related information unless it has at least one VPN with an 
        Import Target identical to one of the VPN-related information 
        Route Target attributes.  Inbound filtering should be used to 
        cause such information to be discarded.  If a new Import Target 
        is later added to one of the PE's VPNs (a "VPN Join" operation), 
        it must then acquire the VPN-related information it may 
        previously have discarded.       

     Ould-Brahim et al.          October 2006                    [Page 5] 

        draft-ietf-l1vpn-bgp-auto-discovery-01.txt      October 2006 

        This can be done using the refresh mechanism described in [BGP-
        RFSH]. The outbound route filtering mechanism of [BGP-ORF], 
        [BGP-CONS] can also be used to advantage to make the filtering 
        more dynamic. 
         
        Similarly, if a particular Import Target is no longer present in 
        any of a PE's VPNs (as a result of one or more "VPN Prune" 
        operations), the PE may discard all VPN-related information 
        which, as a result, no longer have any of the PE's VPN's Import 
        Targets as one of their Route Target Attributes. 
         
        Note that VPN Join and Prune operations are non-disruptive, and 
        do not require any BGP connections to be brought down, as long 
        as the refresh mechanism of [BGP-RFSH] is used. 
         
        As a result of these distribution rules, no one PE ever needs to 
        maintain all routes for all L1VPNs; this is an important 
        scalability consideration. 
         
        Route reflectors can be partitioned among VPNs so that each 
        partition carries routes for only a subset of the L1VPNs 
        supported by the Service Provider. Thus no single route 
        reflector is required to maintain VPN-related information for 
        all VPNs. 
         
        For inter-provider VPNs, if multi-hop EBGP is used, then the 
        ASBRs need not maintain and distribute VPN-related information 
        at all. P routers do not maintain any VPN-related information.   
         
        As a result, no single component within the Service Provider 
        network has to maintain all the VPN-related information for all 
        the VPNs. So the total capacity of the network to support 
        increasing numbers of VPNs is not limited by the capacity of any 
        individual component. 
         
        An important consideration to remember is that one may have any 
        number of INDEPENDENT BGP systems carrying VPN-related 
        information. This is unlike the case of the Internet, where the 
        Internet BGP system must carry all the Internet routes. Thus one 
        significant (but perhaps subtle) distinction between the use of 
        BGP for the Internet routing and the use of BGP for distributing 
        VPN-related information, as described in this document is that 
        the former is not amenable to partition, while the latter is. 
               
     6. Security Considerations 
         
        This document describes a BGP-based auto-discovery mechanism 
        which enables a PE that attaches to a particular L1VPN to 
        discover the set of other PE routers that attach to the same 
        VPN.  Each PE router that is attached to a given VPN uses BGP 
        to advertise that fact. Other PE routers which attach to the 
        same VPN receive these BGP advertisements. This allows that set 

     Ould-Brahim et al.          October 2006                    [Page 6] 
    draft-ietf-l1vpn-bgp-auto-discovery-01.txt      October 2006 

        of PE to discover each other. Note that a PE will not always 
        receive these advertisements directly from the remote PEs; the 
        advertisements may be received from "intermediate" BGP 
        speakers. 
         
        It is of critical importance that a particular PE should not be 
        "discovered" to be attached to a particular VPN unless that PE 
        really is attached to that VPN, and indeed is properly 
        authorized to be attached to that VPN.  If any arbitrary node 
        on the Internet could start sending these BGP advertisements, 
        and if those advertisements were able to reach the PE nodes, 
        and if the PE nodes accepted those advertisements, then anyone 
        could add any site to any L1VPN.  Thus the auto-discovery 
        procedures described here presuppose that a particular PE 
        trusts its BGP peers to be who they appear to be, and further 
        that it can trusts those peers to be properly securing their 
        local attachments.  (That is, a PE must trust that its peers 
        are attached to, and are authorized to be attached to, the 
        L1VPNs to which they claim to be attached.). 
         
        If a particular remote PE is a BGP peer of the local PE, then 
        the BGP authentication procedures of RFC 2385 can be used to 
        ensure that the remote PE is who it claims to be, i.e., that it 
        is a PE that is trusted. 
         
        If a particular remote PE is not a BGP peer of the local PE, 
        then the information it is advertising is being distributed to 
        the local PE through a chain of BGP speakers.  The local PE 
        must trust that its peers only accept information from peers 
        that they trust in turn, and this trust relation must be 
        transitive.  BGP does not provide a way to determine that any 
        particular piece of received information originated from a BGP 
        speaker that was authorized to advertise that particular piece 
        of information.  Hence the procedures of this document should 
        be used only in environments where adequate trust relationships 
        exist among the BGP speakers.
