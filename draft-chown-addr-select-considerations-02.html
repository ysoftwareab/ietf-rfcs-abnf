<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
RFC 3484 (IPv6 Default Address Selection) <a class='info' href='#RFC3484'>[RFC3484]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Draves, R., &ldquo;Default Address Selection for Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>
defines mechanisms for nodes to perform source and destination
address selection choices when faced with multiple addresses to
choose between when initiating a communication.   While RFC3484
recognised the need for implementations to be able to change the 
policy table, a requirement has now also emerged for 
administrators to be able to dynamically change the policy 
tables from a central control point, and for nomadic 
hosts to be able to obtain the policy for the network 
that they are currently attached to without manual user intervention.
This text discusses considerations for such policy changes, including
examples of cases where a change of policy is required, and the
likely frequency of such policy changes.   This text also includes some
discussion on the need to also update RFC3484, where default policies
are currently defined.

Introduction</h3>

<p>
There have been various operational issues observed 
with Default Address Selection for IPv6 (RFC3484)
<a class='info' href='#RFC3484'>[RFC3484]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Draves, R., &ldquo;Default Address Selection for Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>, as described in RFC5220
<a class='info' href='#RFC5220'>[RFC5220]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Matsumoto, A., Fujisaki, T., Hiromi, R., and K. Kanayama, &ldquo;Problem Statement for Default Address Selection in Multi-Prefix Environments: Operational Issues of RFC 3484 Default Rules,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.  As as a result, there has been some demand
for hosts to be able to have their policy tables, and potentially the 
rules described in RFC3484, modified dynamically.   
Such changes may apply to 'static' hosts in a network where policies or
topologies change, or nomadic hosts within a network for which policies
may vary depending on their location within the network.

<a name="rfc.section.2"></a><h3>2.&nbsp;
Issues to Consider</h3>

<p>
There are a number of aspects to consider in the context of such address
selection policy updates.   
	
</p>
<p>
First is the frequency for which such updates
are likely to be required; this will be determined largely from identifying
the scenarios in which policy changes will be required.  This may include
overriding default system policies on startup, as well as changes while
a system is running.  We discuss this topic in Section 4.
	
</p>
<p>
Second, by understanding how dynamic the policy update mechanism needs to be
we should be better placed to determine what types of update approaches best
meet those needs.   There may be other considerations of course, e.g. 
whether the systems are in managed or unmanaged environments, and whether
the solution should be proactive or automated, as discussed in
<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-6man-addr-select-sol'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;6man&#8209;addr&#8209;select&#8209;sol]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Matsumoto, A., Fujisaki, T., and R. Hiromi, &ldquo;Solution approaches for address-selection problems,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>.    Section 5 covers
these issues.
	
</p>
<p>
Third, if we assume some policy update mechanism is defined we should 
consider how hosts and systems may become aware that a policy change has 
happened, and how policy can be disseminated in a timely fashion.
Thus we need to understand what kind of technical/concrete event(s) can be 
used for triggering the policy table update mechanism, e.g. address 
re-obtainment, address lifetime expiration, or perhaps policy lifetime 
expiration.   We also need to consider what other factors may come
into play, e.g. potential policy conflicts.  This is discussed in Section 6.
	
</p>
<p>
After analysing these issues, we can make some initial comments regarding
the potential solution spaces, and what models may be well suited, e.g.
push vs pull models, and what other methods might assist us, e.g. hints
from local routing tables.   This is covered in Section 7.
	
</p>
<p>
Finally, we should assess whether these
update solutions require or need 3484 to be updated.  In some
instances, we might envision solutions that simply use RFC3484 as 
guidelines and provide sufficient controls to address the current limitations 
in the RFC.   However, as noted in RFC5220
<a class='info' href='#RFC5220'>[RFC5220]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Matsumoto, A., Fujisaki, T., Hiromi, R., and K. Kanayama, &ldquo;Problem Statement for Default Address Selection in Multi-Prefix Environments: Operational Issues of RFC 3484 Default Rules,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>, not all the operational issues observed to
date can be remedied by updating RFC3484 alone.
There is already a good analysis of issues with RFC3484 and how the
text could be revised
<a class='info' href='#I-D.arifumi-6man-rfc3484-revise'>[I&#8209;D.arifumi&#8209;6man&#8209;rfc3484&#8209;revise]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Matsumoto, A., Fujisaki, T., and R. Hiromi, &ldquo;Things To Be Considered for RFC 3484 Revision,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>).

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
Other Related Work</h3>

<p>
We note that there is some existing work in defining Requirements for
Address Selection Mechanisms
<a class='info' href='#RFC5221'>[RFC5221]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Matsumoto, A., Fujisaki, T., Hiromi, R., and K. Kanayama, &ldquo;Requirements for Address Selection Mechanisms,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>,
and some initial work has been done in the solution space (for DHCP)
<a class='info' href='#I-D.fujisaki-dhc-addr-select-opt'>[I&#8209;D.fujisaki&#8209;dhc&#8209;addr&#8209;select&#8209;opt]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Fujisaki, T., Matsumoto, A., and R. Hiromi, &ldquo;Distributing Address Selection Policy using DHCPv6,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>, but these are not
discussed here.   While RFC5221 does assume that a dynamic policy update
mechanism of some form is available, this draft is currently aimed at
understanding the scenarios and triggers for policy changes, to better
inform future solution discussions.

<a name="rfc.section.4"></a><h3>4.&nbsp;
Drivers for Policy Changes</h3>

<p>
If we wish to determine how frequent address selection policy changes are likely
to be, we need to understand why such policies might need to be
changed, for particular sites or networks.
	
</p>
<p>
One reference text for potential drivers for policy change
is RFC5220, in which operational issues with the existing policies described
in RFC3484 are listed.   Each subsection of this document gives a reason
why the existing rules or policy tables in RFC3484 may not be sufficient
in certain cases.
There have been some significant changes to IPv6 since RFC3484 was drafted
which have impacted the RFC, e.g.
the introduction of Unique Local Addresses (ULAs), and concerns about
longest prefix matching affecting (DNS) round robin load balancing.
	
</p>
<p>
In summary, the issues raised in RFC5220 were:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Multiple Routers on a Single Interface
</li>
<li>Ingress Filtering
</li>
<li>Problem Half-Closed Network Problem (*)
</li>
<li>Combined Use of Global and ULA (*)
</li>
<li>Site Renumbering (*)
</li>
<li>Multicast Source Address Selection (*)
</li>
<li>Temporary Address Selection
</li>
<li>IPv4 or IPv6 Prioritization (*)
</li>
<li>ULA and IPv4 Dual-Stack Environment (*)
</li>
<li>ULA or Global Prioritization (*)
</li>
</ul><p>
	
</p>
<p>
The authors of RFC5220 noted which of these issues can be solved by changes to
the RFC3484 policy table, marked (*) above, and which cannot.  It is interesting
to note that issues largely related to internal networking and 
(administrative) policy decisions can be handled this way.

<a name="rfc.section.4.1"></a><h3>4.1.&nbsp;
Internal vs External Triggers</h3>

<p>
When considering drivers or triggers that may lead to a requirement for
the policy to change, we can divide the problem space into those 
external to a site or network and those internal to it.     
In the case of the first two examples above, 
a dynamic policy table update may be required by externally driven
routing changes, assuming the site uses a dynamic routing protocol
intra-site and the routing protocol is configured to reflect changes
of extra-site routing topology.   
	
</p>
<p>
If a site is multihomed using BGP and advertising a single prefix upstream,
then no policy table manipulation is required for global address preferences.
However where a site is multihomed by receiving a prefix from each upstream
provider, each host will have multiple addresses and many need policy
table manipulation.
In such a case, the policy table of hosts may thus need to be updated
according to the routing policy.   
	
</p>
<p>
It should be noted that we have other mechanisms for dynamic routing
topology change, for example deprecating one of the advertised prefixes,
perhaps when one of the upstream links has a problems.
	
</p>
<p>
Other examples of external factors include a new transition mechanism
being defined (e.g. as with the emergence of Teredo using 2001::/32
as assigned by IANA) and its inclusion being required in the policy table, 
a new address block being defined,

Administratively Triggered Changes</h3>

<p>
The other examples above are, in the general case, where the
site administrator chooses to change a local policy and in doing so 
triggers the need for policy table updates.   Some of these
changes one might assume to be set once, and to change rarely, 
for example:
	
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li> Setting priority use of IPv6 over IPv4 (or vice versa).
</li>
<li> Setting priority use of ULAs over globals (or vice versa).
</li>
<li> Setting priority use of privacy addresses over DNS-published globals (or vice versa).
</li>
<li> An internal network renumbering occurs, perhaps due to a site expanding.
</li>
<li> The nature of the external connectivity through multiple ISPs requires 
specific additional information (policy) to be delivered to certain hosts
(as discussed in 2.1.3 in RFC5220).
</li>
<li> Disabling longest-prefix match functions to facilitate round-robin load
balancing.
</li>
</ul><p>
	
</p>
<p>
However it may be the case that different parts of a site have different
policies, or policies are changed in a rolling fashion across a site over
time as IPv6 or ULAs are introduced (for example).   This may happen
where the administrator prefers a gradual introduction of new policy in
a phased operation across a site, rather than changing policy across the
whole site in one operation.
	
</p>
<p>
Other administrative changes may occur more frequently, e.g.:
	
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li> Routing tables and forwarding tables change dynamically.
</li>
<li> A different provider (link) is preferred for a given destination.
</li>
</ul><p>
	
</p>
<p>
It's possible that provider links may vary on a daily basis, or by time
of day.   The frequency of such policy changes will depend on the frequency
that the administrator wishes to change the traffic engineering policies.

Start-up vs Running Changes</h3>

<p>
When a host starts up it may be configured with the default RFC3484 policies.
At this stage a number of addresses may be configured on a number of interfaces
on the host.   At this time it may be desirable for the host to be able
to receive the site-specific policy updates as a start-up override from
the RFC3484 defaults.
	
</p>
<p>
Other policy changes may later be required while the host is running.   Ideally
the same protocol should be used for the start-up and running state updates.

Nomadic Nodes</h3>

<p>
A host may be nomadic within a site and as a result it may see
the preferred policy change
depending on the host's topological location within that site.   Such a host
should be capable of receiving policy updates in a timely fashion as it
migrates within the network.    
	
</p>
<p>
While this may be one case of 'running changes'
described above, the policy changes are required due to the host's new point
of attachment, not changes of policy to the current point of attachment.

<a name="rfc.section.4.5"></a><h3>4.5.&nbsp;
Multiple Interface Nodes</h3>

<p>
In considering scenarios where hosts may be multi-addressed and require
policy to assist in address selection, the issue of hosts with 
multiple interfaces arose.
	
</p>
<p>
A host may have a variety of reasons to have multiple interfaces.  It may
for example have WiFi and 3G interfaces, and be capable of sending or
receiving data over either interface.   In some cases these interfaces
may fall within the same administrative domain (ISP) and in some cases
they may not.   Another example would be the case of a host with a
VPN connection established, where address selection may be affected by the
choice of whether the VPN connection is used or not.
	
</p>
<p>
This is clearly an important problem today, but we note that RFC3484 is
currently
defined as a per-node, not per-interface, mechanism.   While the multiple
interface problem is interesting, we feel it is out of scope of this draft.
This draft is only focused on handling multiple policies into one 
interface and conveying them into the hosts' RFC3484 policy table.
	
</p>
<p>
We note that there are some new, initial drafts published recently on the 
multiple interface problem

extensions) may be of interest when considering our solution space.

How Dynamic?</h3>

<p>
The discussion above suggests that many of the potential triggers for
policy table changes are 'one-off' in nature, i.e. a site makes a one-time
policy change.   It is thus unlikely that such administrative changes will
be frequent.
	
</p>
<p>
There are some cases where updates may be required to be 
more frequent.   In the example of a site which is implementing the 
gradual introduction of new policy across its network, while the frequency
of changes may be relatively high, there is still probably only one or a
small number of changes per host.   
	
</p>
<p>
There may be a higher rate of policy changes within a site if there are
nomadic hosts within the site, and these are roaming frequently to
parts of the network where differing policies are in effect.   In such
cases it may be useful for a host to know whether or not the default
RFC3484 (or soon to be 3484bis) policies are in effect or not, and for
there to be a 'cheap' way for the host to discover this.
	
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the biggest cause of policy change lies where the preferred links 
or paths for certain destinations change frequently
over time as traffic engineering requirements change.   In some networks this
may be a daily change, or change between states at different times of day.
It is not clear 
how common these cases are, and thus further input is welcomed here.
	
</p>
<p>
In terms of the impact of frequency of policy changes on solutions,
we first need to ensure there is some consensus on the drivers for
policy change and thus the frequency of changes.   
At this stage we note
that the analysis is simplified if we assume that only administrative
changes are considered, and that it would be highly preferable if the start-up
and running state solutions used the same protocol.

Considerations when Obtaining Policy</h3>

<p>
When a policy change is made, or a host migrates to a part of the
network with different policies, that change of policy needs to
be conveyed to the host.  It needs to be made available and 
applied without restarting every affected host.
	
</p>

<a name="rfc.section.6.1"></a><h3>6.1.&nbsp;
Changes in Available Address(es)</h3>

<p>
One might assume at first that when a host observes
a change in its addresses, it should re-obtain the selection policy,
but this may not always be the case.
It should be noted that not all policy changes are tied 
to a host changing one or more addresses, though it may be acceptable
to query regardless for new policy (if a pull model is used) when 
address information changes.
	
</p>
<p>
As described above, it may be sufficient for a host to know when
a policy is changed, or that perhaps the default policy is - or is
not - in effect in its current locale.
	
</p>

<a name="rfc.section.6.2"></a><h3>6.2.&nbsp;
Timeliness</h3>

<p>
In many, but not all, cases a policy change will need to be 
synchronised across a network.
Thus there is a general issue of timely and synchronised 
dissemination of new policy.
If the policy is distributed via the same mechanism that informs a
host of a change of address(es), the application of the policy should
be synchronised sufficiently with the address change.   However, 
not all hosts may receive the update information at the same time, e.g.
where new address assignments may be dependent on DHCP lease timers.
	
</p>
<p>
Where hosts use DHCPv6 for address information, in the absence of some
form of Reconfigure message, a host may see a delay in policy changes
being notified.   One possible tool to help here is the DHCPv6
Lifetime Option (RFC4242)
<a class='info' href='#RFC4242'>[RFC4242]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Venaas, S., Chown, T., and B. Volz, &ldquo;Information Refresh Time Option for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6),&rdquo; November&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>, which was originally introduced to assist
with network renumbering events.

<a name="rfc.section.6.3"></a><h3>6.3.&nbsp;
Manual Configuration?</h3>

<p>
There are scenarios where a host may wish to ignore conveyed policy.
For example, the manager of a mobile node may not want 
to have its preferences changed by a visited network.  In such a case
one might argue that the
mobile node should use MIPv6 with whatever its home network 
policies are.  
	
</p>
<p>
The implication again is that we need a flag of some kind to 
inform a host whether network it is in uses the default RFC3484 
policy, which would then allow
each end system to decide if it should get an (overriding) local 
policy or not.

<a name="rfc.section.6.4"></a><h3>6.4.&nbsp;
Policy Conflicts</h3>

<p>
As the above suggests, it 
is possible that conflicting policies may be available to a host, 
regardless of whether a push or pull model is used to distribute policy.   
For example, where a host is
on a subnet with two or more routers under different administrative
control, the policies may differ.   The question then is how such
conflicts can be resolved.   If there are mergers of policies, the rules
for such mergers need careful consideration.   Otherwise
the host may have to simply choose one policy by some method.
Ideally we would limit the scope of this problem to scenarios
where hosts are operating under a single administrative entity, which should
ensure policies are consistent.

Is default policy used?</h3>

<p>
There should be some mechanism to indicate to a host that the local network
does not use the default RFC3484 policy, and that a revised policy table is
available (and should be used).   However it should also be possible for a
host to detect that policy has changed (whether 'around' the host, or due
to the host being nomadic).   
	
</p>
<p>	
It is assumed by 'default' policy here we refer to the revised/updated 
RFC3484 specification, when that is produced.   The question as to how
a non-default policy is indicated may be steered by which we believe to be
the common case in the longer term - hosts that need local policy changes, 
or hosts that do not.   If an RA bit is used to indicate whether a local
policy is available, we avoid hosts requesting potentially non-existent
policy tables (or copies of default tables they already have) forever.

<a name="rfc.section.7.2"></a><h3>7.2.&nbsp;
Pull model</h3>

<p>
One approach would be to define appropriate extensions to DHCPv6 to allow
policy table updates to be applied to a host.
There are some recent initial proposals in this area, in particular
<a class='info' href='#I-D.sun-mif-route-config-dhcp6'>[I&#8209;D.sun&#8209;mif&#8209;route&#8209;config&#8209;dhcp6]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Sun, T. and H. Deng, &ldquo;Route Configuration by DHCPv6 Option for Hosts with Multiple Interfaces,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.
There are also proposals to convey routing information via DHCPv6 to a host,
to facilitate better selection decisions, e.g.
<a class='info' href='#I-D.dec-dhcpv6-route-option'>[I&#8209;D.dec&#8209;dhcpv6&#8209;route&#8209;option]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Dec, W. and R. Johnson, &ldquo;DHCPv6 Route Option,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>,

be applicable in the context of this discussion remains to be determined.
	
</p>
<p>
The DHCP model allows individual nodes to potentially have differing 
policy, even when on the same subnet.

Push model</h3>

<p>
A push model could also be possible.  There may be some options to piggyback
clues to the host into a Router Advertisement message, though initial
consensus seems to be that this is a less attractive approach.   However,
we may find that RAs may be a good place to indicate whether a default 
policy is in place or not, to avoid hosts requesting non-existent updates
via DHCPv6.

Routing Hints</h3>

<p>
If a host has routing hints available, it may be able to make more informed
selections.  It may be that the most
appropriate way to pass routing state is with a routing protocol from an
active router.   For example, a RIP listener could help to 
resolve the routing policy part of this problem space, 
but that would take us back to the issue of address
selection in the cases where multiple default routes were advertised.
	
</p>
<p>
At this stage we can simply note that address selection is
simplified when routing state is provided to the end system.
How routing state is passed is for future discussion; it may 
for example be via the DHCPv6 extensions described above.
	
</p>
<p>
It is noted in <a class='info' href='#I-D.carpenter-renum-needs-work'>[I&#8209;D.carpenter&#8209;renum&#8209;needs&#8209;work]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Carpenter, B., Atkinson, R., and H. Flinck, &ldquo;Renumbering still needs work,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>
that:
	
</p>
<p>
"In an environment where a site has more than one upstream link to the
outside world, the site might have more than one valid routing
   prefix.  In such cases, typically all valid routing prefixes within a
   site will have the same prefix length.  Also in such cases, it might
   be desirable for hosts that obtain their addresses using DHCPv6 to
   learn about the availability of upstream links dynamically, by
   deducing from periodic IPv6 RA messages which routing prefixes are
   currently valid.  This application seems possible within the IPv6
   Neighbour Discovery architecture, but does not appear to be clearly
   specified anywhere."
	
</p>
<p>
The same thought seems relevant to address selection. There's no
point selecting a source address whose prefix is not being advertised
in RAs.
	
</p>
<p>
While routing and prefix hints may help a host make selection decisions,
we should consider to what extent we wish to 'burden' a host with 
holding such information.

Conflicts/Merging Policies</h3>

<p>
It is not yet clear whether entire policy tables will be made available,
or simply differences to the 'default', and thus whether policies may
need to be merged, or overridden.   Some policy conflicts will be 
unresolvable, e.g. one prefers IPv4 over IPv6, the other vice-versa.
It may be simpler, though arguably 
less efficient, for whole policy tables to be distributed, to avoid the
merger problem.  
	
</p>
<p>
One option may be to split the policy table into destination address
selection and source address selection tables, with the policy
distribution only updating the source address selection.   Whether this
might make merging policies simpler or in fact more complex would
require further study.
	
</p>
<p>
It may also be possible to indicate some priority value for a policy, e.g.
the priority of the interface it is received on.   Or if there are
multiple policies in conflict, a host could simply choose to fall back
to use the default RFC3484 policy.
	
</p>
<p> 
A host also needs to know how to decide when to accept a policy.  We could
simplify the discussion by assuming a host is located in and only nomadic
within a single site with one administrative controlling entity.

On RFC3484 Default Policies</h3>

<p>
RFC3484 includes text about mechanisms for changing policy, having 'policy
hooks' and having a configurable policy table.   The implication is
that defaults can be changed, and the text gives examples of this in 
Section 10.   However, issues with RFC3484 are broader that just policy
table updates - it remains the case that
some operational issues with RFC3484 are not just related to the table,
but on rules themselves, e.g. longest prefix match (affecting DNS round
robin as described in <a class='info' href='#RFC5220'>[RFC5220]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Matsumoto, A., Fujisaki, T., Hiromi, R., and K. Kanayama, &ldquo;Problem Statement for Default Address Selection in Multi-Prefix Environments: Operational Issues of RFC 3484 Default Rules,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>).  
	
</p>
<p>
While discussing default policy, we noted that
the word 'default' has to be defined here, i.e. what
is the scope of this 'default'. It seems it is 'system wide'
but first it just moves the issue to the 'system' definition
and second larger or smaller granularities make sense (for
instance 'link wide' and 'user wide').   Whether and how this can
be considered in an open question.   Currently we assume RFC3484 and
changes to it will remain node-specific.
	
</p>
<p>
It certainly seems the case that the issues raised in RFC5220, and
discussed in <a class='info' href='#I-D.arifumi-6man-rfc3484-revise'>[I&#8209;D.arifumi&#8209;6man&#8209;rfc3484&#8209;revise]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Matsumoto, A., Fujisaki, T., and R. Hiromi, &ldquo;Things To Be Considered for RFC 3484 Revision,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> mean
that an update of RFC3484 is required, if only because some of the issues 
(as highlighted earlier) cannot be addressed by updating the policy
table alone.   
	
</p>
<p>
We do not note any specific comments here on how RFC3484 should be updated.
Other drafts have made suggestions.   There are some discussions
on ideas however, e.g. on the semantics of labels, and in adding ULAs
explicitly to the default policy table.

Conclusions</h3>

<p>
We believe the scope of this text should apply to site and enterprise
networks, where an administrator may need to change policies over time, but that
it includes nomadic nodes within the site, which may migrate to different parts
of the site where different policies are required.    This is the focus of
our analysis.   We note there is potentially
complementary work within the multiple interface (mif) community on handling
address selection issues for mobile nodes with multiple interfaces, and that
outputs from that community may be applicable to our problem space.
	
</p>
<p>
There is clearly a need to revise RFC3484, to create a new default policy for
address selection.  This should be expedited.   We also note that RFC3484
is currently defined on a per-node, not per-interface basis, which we
believe should remain the status quo for the scope of this work.   It is
not clear how or if the mif work will affect this assumption.
	
</p>
<p>
The scope of this text includes issues affecting the design of a protocol to
allow a host's RFC3484 policy table to be updated.   
It has been suggested that hosts may receive conflicting policy table updates
in some scenarios.  
However, heuristics for policy table mergers may prove problematic to devise,
so the problem space for policy distribution and updates could be simplified
if we can assume hosts are operating in a network under one administrative
entity.  It is simplified further if we only consider policy changes triggered
for administrative reasons.
	
</p>
<p>
In terms of push or pull-based methods
 for policy distribution, early analysis suggests that
a push-based hint to hosts as to whether they are in a network where the
default policy applies or not would be useful.   This might be 
indicated via an RA flag, perhaps.
In terms of obtaining policy, a pull-based solution, such as DHCPv6,
may be preferable if inidividual hosts on a subnet require differing
policies.   Also, the same protocol for policy updates should probably
be used whether a host
is starting up, or if updates are required while the node is running.
