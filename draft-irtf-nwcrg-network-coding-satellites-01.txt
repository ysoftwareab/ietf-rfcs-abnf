1.  Introduction

   Guaranteeing both physical layer robustness and efficient usage of
   the radio resource has been in the core design of SATellite
   COMmunication (SATCOM) systems.  The trade-off often resided in how
   much redundancy a system adds to cope from link impairments, without
   reducing the good-put when the channel quality is high.  There is
   usually enough redundancy to guarantee a Quasi-Error Free
   transmission.  However, physical layer reliability mechanisms may not
   recover transmission losses (e.g. with a mobile user) and layer 2 (or
   above) re-transmissions induce 500 ms one-way delay with a
   geostationary satellite.  Further exploiting coding schemes at higher
   OSI-layers is an opportunity for releasing constraints on the
   physical layer in such cases and improving the performance of SATCOM
   systems.

   We have noticed an active research activity on coding and SATCOM in
   the past.  That being said, not much has actually made it to
   industrial developments.  In this context, this document aims at
   identifying opportunities for further usage of coding in these
   systems.

2.  A note on satellite topology

   This section focuses on a generic description of the components
   composing a generic satellite system and their interaction.  A high
   level description of a multi-gateway satellites network is provided.
   There exist multiple SATCOM systems, such as those dedicated to
   broadcasting TV or to IoT applications: depending on the purpose of
   the SATCOM system, ground segments are specific.  This memo lays on
   SATCOM systems dedicated to Internet access that follows the DVB-S2/
   RCS2 standards.  In this context, the increase of the available
   capacity that is carried out to end users and the need for
   reliability results in the need for multiple gateways for one unique
   satellite platform.

   In this context, Figure 1 shows an example of a multi-gateway
   satellite system.  More details on a generic SATCOM ground segment
   architecture for a bi-directional Internet access can be found in
   [SAT2017].  We propose a multi-gateway system since some of the use-
   cases described in this document require multiple gateways.  In a
   multi-gateway system, some elements may be centralized and/or
   gathered: the relevance of one approach compared to another depends
   on the deployment scenario.  More information on these trade-off
   discussions can be found in [SAT2017].

   It is worth noting that some functional blocks aggregate the traffic
   coming from multiple users.  Even if coding schemes could be applied
   to any individual traffic, it could also work on an aggregate.

3.  Status of reliability schemes in actually deployed satellite systems

   Figure 2 presents the status of the reliability schemes deployment in
   satellite systems.  The information is based on the taxonomy document
   [RFC8406] and the notations are the following: End-to-End Coding
   (E2E), Network Coding (NC), Intra-Flow Coding (IntraF), Inter-Flow
   Coding (InterF), Single-Path Coding (SP) and Multi-Path Coding (MP).

   X1 embodies the source coding that could be used at application level
   for instance within QUIC or other video streaming applications: this
   is not specific to SATCOM systems, but is relevant for broadband
   Internet access discussions.

   X2 embodies the physical layer, applied to the PLFRAME, to optimize
   the satellite capacity usage: at the physical layer, FEC mechanisms
   can be exploited.  This aspect is not in the scope of the WG
   according to the taxonomoy document [RFC8406].

        Figure 2: Reliability schemes in current satellite systems

   Reliability is an inherent part of the physical layer and usually
   achieved by using coding techniques.  Based on public information,
   coding does not seem to be widely used at higher OSI layers, other
   than at the application layer.

4.  Details on the use cases

   This section details use-cases where coding schemes could improve the
   overall performance of a SATCOM system (e.g. considering a more
   efficient usage of the satellite resource, delivery delay, delivery
   ratio).

Internet-Draft        Network coding and satellites             Nov 2018


   It is worth noting that these use-cases focus more on the middleware
   (e.g. aggregation nodes) and packetization UDP/IP of Figure 2.
   Indeed, there are already lots of recovery mechanisms at the physical
   layer in currently deployed systems while E2E source coding are done
   at the application level.  In a multi-gateway SATCOM Internet access,
   the specific opportunities are more relevant in specific SATCOM
   components such as the "network function" block or the "access
   gateway" of Figure 1.

4.1.  Two way relay channel mode

   This use-case considers a two-way communication between end users,
   through a satellite link.  We propose an illustration of this
   scenario in Figure 3.

   Satellite terminal A (resp.  B) transmits a flow A (resp.  B) to a
   server hosting NC capabilities, which forward a combination of the
   two flows to both terminals.  This results in non-negligible
   bandwidth saving and has been demonstrated at ASMS 2010 in Cagliari
   [ASMS2010].  Moreover, with On-Board Processing satellite payloads,
   the coding operations could be done at the satellite level, thus
   reducing the end-to-end delay of the communication.

4.2.  Reliable multicast

   This use-case considers adding redundancy to a multicast flow
   depending on what has been received by different end-users, resulting
   in non-negligible scarce resource saving.  We propose an illustration
   for this scenario in Figure 4.

   A multicast flow (M) is forwarded to both satellite terminals A and
   B.  However packet Ni (resp.  Nj) get lost at terminal A (resp.  B),
   and terminal A (resp.  B) returns a negative acknowledgement Li
   (resp.  Lj), indicating that the packet is missing.  Then either the
   access gateway or the multicast server includes a repair packet
   (rather than the individual Ni and Nj packets) in the multicast flow
   to let both terminals recover from losses.  This could be achieved by
   using NACK-Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) [RFC5740] in situations
   where a feedback is possible and desirable, or FLUTE/ALC [RFC6726]
   when it is not the case.  Note that currently both NORM nor FLUTE/ALC
   are limited to block coding, none of them supporting sliding window
   encoding schemes [RFC8406].

4.3.  Hybrid access

   This use-case considers the use of multiple path management with
   coding at the transport level to increase the reliability and/or the
   total capacity (using multiple path does not guarantee an improvement
   of both the reliability and the total bandwidth).  We propose an
   illustration for this scenario in Figure 5.  This use-case is
   inspired from the Broadband Access via Integrated Terrestrial
   Satellite Systems (BATS) project and has been published as an ETSI
   Technical Report [ETSITR2017].  It is worth nothing that this kind of
   architecture is also discussed in the MPTCP working group
   [I-D.boucadair-mptcp-dhc].

   To cope with packet loss (due to either end-user mobility or physical
   layer impairments), coding could be introduced in both the CPE and at
   the concentrator.

4.4.  Dealing with varying capacity

   This use-case considers the usage of coding to overcome cases where
   the wireless link characteristics quickly change overtime and where
   the physical layer codes could not be made robust in time.  This is
   particularly relevant when end users are moving and the channel shows
   important variations [IEEEVT2001].

   The architecture is recalled in Figure 6.  In these cases, Adaptative
   Coding and Modulation (ACM) may not adapt the modulation and coding
   accordingly and remaining errors could be recovered with higher
   layers redundancy packets.  The coding schemes could be applied at
   the access gateway or the network function block levels to increase
   the reliability of the transmission.  This use-case is mostly
   relevant for when mobile users are considered or when the chosen band
   induce a required physical layer coding that may change over time (Q/
   V bands, Ka band, etc.).  Depending on the use-case (e.g. very high
   frequency bands, mobile users) or depending on the deployment use-
   cases (e.g. performance of the network between each individual
   block), the relevance of adding coding is different.  Then, depending
   on the OSI level at which coding is applied, the impact on the
   satellite terminal is different: coding may be applied on IP packets

4.5.  Improving the gateway handovers

   This use-case considers the recovery of packets that may be lost
   during gateway handovers.  Whether this is for off-loading one given
   equipment or because the transmission quality is not the same on each
   gateway, changing the transmission gateway may be relevant.  However,
   if gateways are not properly synchronized, this may result in packet
   loss.  During these critical phases, coding can be added to improve
   the reliability of the transmission and propose a seamless gateway
   handover.  In this case, the coding could be applied at either the
   access gateway or the network function block.  The entity responsible
   for taking the decision to change the communication gateway and
   changing the routes is the control plane manager; this entity
   exploits a management interface.

   An example architecture for this use-case is showed in Figure 7.  It
   is worth noting that depending on the ground architecture
   [I-D.chin-nfvrg-cloud-5g-core-structure-yang] [SAT2017], some
   equipment might be communalised.

4.6.  Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networks

   Establishing communications from terrestrial gateways to aerospace
   components is a challenge due to the distances involved.  As a matter
   of fact, reliable end-to-end (E2E) communications over such links
   must cope with long delay and frequent link disruptions.  Delay/
   Disruption Tolerant Networking [RFC4838] is a solution to enable
   reliable internetworking space communications where both standard ad-
   hoc routing and E2E Internet protocols cannot be used.  DTN can also
   be seen as an alternative solution to cope with satellite
   communications usually managed by PEP.  Therefore, the transport of
   data over such networks requires the use of replication, erasure
   codes and multipath protocol schemes [WANG05] [ZHANG06] to improve
   the bundle delivery ratio and/or delivery delay.  For instance,
   transport protocols such as LTP [RFC5326] for long delay links with
   connectivity disruptions, use Automatic Repeat-reQuest (ARQ) and
   unequal error protection to reduce the amount of non-mandatory re-
   transmissions.  The work in [TOURNOUX10] proposed upon LTP a robust
   streaming method based on an on-the-fly coding scheme, where encoding
   and decoding procedures are done at the source and destination nodes,
   respectively.  However, each link path loss rate may have various
   order of magnitude and re-encoding at an intermediate node to adapt
   the redundancy can be mandatory to prevent transmission wasting.
   This idea has been put forward in
   [I-D.zinky-dtnrg-random-binary-fec-scheme] and
   [I-D.zinky-dtnrg-erasure-coding-extension], where the authors

Internet-Draft        Network coding and satellites             Nov 2018


   proposed an encoding process at intermediate DTN nodes to explore the
   possibilities of Forward Error Correction (FEC) schemes inside the
   bundle protocol [RFC5050].  Another proposal is the use of erasure
   coding inside the CCSDS (Consultative Committee for Space Data
   Systems) architecture [COLA11].  The objective is to extend the CCSDS
   File Delivery Protocol (CFDP) [CCSDS-FDP] with erasure coding
   capabilities where a Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) [RFC6816] code
   with a large block size is chosen.  Recently, on-the-fly erasure
   coding schemes [LACAN08] [SUNDARARAJAN08] [TOURNOUX11] have shown
   their benefits in terms of recovery capability and configuration
   complexity compared to traditional FEC schemes.  Using a feedback
   path when available, on-the-fly schemes can be used to enable E2E
   reliable communication over DTN with adaptive re-encoding as proposed
   in [THAI15].

5.  Research challenges

5.1.  Deployability in current SATCOM systems

   SATCOM systems typically feature Performance Enhancement Proxy
   RFC 3135 [RFC3135] which could be relevant to host coding mechanisms
   and thus support the use-cases that have been discussed in Section 4.
   PEP usually split TCP end-to-end connections and forward TCP packets
   to the satellite baseband gateway that deals with layer 2 and layer 1
   encapsulations.  Deploying coding schemes at the TCP level in these
   equipments could be relevant and independent from the specificities
   of a SATCOM link.  That being said, we can notice a research issue in
   the recurrent trade-off in SATCOM systems that is related to the
   amount of reliability that you introduce in the first transmission to
   guarantee a better end-user QoE and the usage of the scarce resource.

5.2.  Interaction with virtualization

   Related to the foreseen virtualized network infrastructure, the
   coding schemes could be proposed as Virtual Network Function (VNF)
   and their deployability enhanced.  The architecture for the next
   generation of SATCOM ground segments would rely on a virtualized
   environment.  This trend can also be seen, making the discussions on
   the deployability of coding in SATCOM extendable to other deployment
   scenarios [I-D.chin-nfvrg-cloud-5g-core-structure-yang].  As one
   example, the coding VNF functions deployment in a virtualized
   environment is presented in
   [I-D.vazquez-nfvrg-netcod-function-virtualization].  A research
   challenge would be the optimization of the NFV service function
   chaining, considering a virtualized infrastructure and other SATCOM
   specific functions, to guarantee an efficient radio resource
   utilization and easy to deploy SATCOM services.

6.  Conclusion

   This document presents the current deployment of coding in some
   satellite telecommunications systems along with a discussion on the
   multiple opportunities to introduce these techniques at a wider
   scale.

   Even if this document focuses on satellite systems, it is worth
   pointing out that the some scenarios proposed may be relevant to
   other wireless telecommunication systems.  As one example, the
   generic architecture proposed in Figure 1 may be mapped to cellular
   networks as follows: the 'network function' block gather some of the
   functions of the Evolved Packet Core subsystem, while the 'access
   gateway' and 'physical gateway' blocks gather the same type of
   functions as the Universal Mobile Terrestrial Radio Access Network.
   This mapping extends the opportunities identified in this draft since
   they may be also relevant for cellular networks.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

9.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations are inherent to any access network.  SATCOM
   systems introduce standard security mechanisms.  In particular, there
   are some specificities related to the fact that all users under the
   coverage can record all the packets that are being transmitted, such
   as in LTE networks.  On the specific scenario of NC in SATCOM
   systems, there are no specific security considerations.
