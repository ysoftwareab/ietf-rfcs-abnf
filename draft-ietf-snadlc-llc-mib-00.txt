2.  Abstract

This specification defines an extension to the Management Information
Base (MIB) for use with SNMP-based network management.  In particular,
it defines objects for managing the configuration, monitoring and con-
trol of data link controls in an SNA environment. This draft identifies

managed objects for SNA Logical Link Control (LLC) links only.

This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet community.

3.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major com-
ponents.  They are:

     o    RFC 1441 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
          describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

     o    RFC 1213 defines MIB-II, the core set of managed objects for
          the Internet suite of protocols.

     o    RFC 1445 which defines the administrative and other architec-
          tural aspects of the framework.

     o    RFC 1448 which defines the protocol used for network access to
          managed objects.

The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
experimentation and evaluation.

3.1.  Object Definitions

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are defined
using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the
SMI.  In particular, each object object type is named by an OBJECT IDEN-
TIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object type together
with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instan-
tiation of the object.  For human convenience, we often use a textual
string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the object type.

4.  Overview

This draft identifies the proposed set of objects for configuring, moni-
toring, and controlling LLC ports and link stations.

4.1.  Tables Defined in the SNADLC LLC MIB

The SNADLC MIB is composed of three managed entities with three tables
each.  The three managed entities for LLC are:

     o    Ports: the physical connection,

     o    SAPs: the local services for the Port, and

Internet Draft               SNADLC LLC MIB                    July 1994


     o    Connection Components: the logical connections for the SAP.

The three management tables are:

     o    Adminstration: objects used for configuring and controlling
          the operation of a Port, SAP or Connection Component,

     o    Operational: objects that reflect the run-time state of the
          Port, SAP or Connection Component, and

     o    Statistics: objects that reflect the operating metrics of the
          Port, SAP or Connection Component.

Considering the above combinations, the following are the actual tables
found in this MIB:

     1)   Port Administration Table,

     2)   Port Operation Table,

     3)   Port Statistics Table,

     4)   SAP Administration Table,

     5)   SAP Operation Table,

     6)   SAP Statistics Table,

     7)   Connection Component Administration Table,

     8)   Connection Component Operation Table,

     9)   Connection Component Statistics Table.

All variables in this MIB relate to LLC ports and link stations only.
Any variable relating to higher-layer entities in SNA such as Physical
Units (PU) and Logical Units (LU) are found in the SNA NAU MIB [4].

4.2.  Row Creation Mechanism

Row creation mechanism for the llcCCAdminTable is based on the use of
the RowStatus object.  It follows the rules for the use in SNMPv1 con-
text proposed in the memo "Row creation with SNMPv1" [5].  Before
accepting the destroy value for an entry, an agent has to verify the
operational state of the corresponding entry in the llcCCOperTable
entry.

8.  Glossary

     link station
         A link station comprises procedures and control information
         that coordinate the transfer of data between two nodes joined
         by a link connection.  All traffic over the link connection is
         from the primary link station to one or more secondary link
         stations, or from a secondary link station to the primary link
         station.

     primary link station
         The link station instance on a link connection that is respon-
         sible for the control of the data link.  There must be only one
         primary link station on a link connection.  The primary link
         station issues commands to one or more secondary link stations.

     secondary link station
         The link station instance on a link connection that receives
         commands from the primary link station and issues responses to
         it.

9.  Security Considerations

Security issues are not discussed in this memo.
