                Coding techniques for satellite systems
             draft-irtf-nwcrg-network-coding-satellites-05

Abstract

   This document is the product of the Coding for Efficient Network
   Communications Research Group (NWCRG).  This document follows the
   taxonomy document [RFC8406] and considers coding as a linear
   combination of packets that operate above the network layer.  In this
   context, this memo details a multi-gateway satellite system to
   identify use-cases where coding is relevant.  As example, coding
   operating above the network layer can be exploited to cope from
   residual losses or provide reliable multicast services.  The
   objective is to contribute to a larger deployment of such techniques
   in SATCOM systems.  This memo also identifies open research issues
   related to the deployment of coding in SATCOM systems, such as the
   interaction between congestion controls and coding techniques.

1.  Introduction

   Guaranteeing both physical-layer robustness and efficient usage of
   the radio resource has been in the core design of SATellite
   COMmunication (SATCOM) systems.  The trade-off often resided in how
   much redundancy a system adds to cope from link impairments, without
   reducing the goodput when the channel quality is good.  There is
   usually enough redundancy to guarantee a Quasi-Error Free
   transmission.  The recovery time depends on the encoding block size.
   Considering for instance geostationary satellite system (GEO),
   physical or link layers erasure coding mechanisms recover
   transmission losses within a negligible delay compared to link delay.

   However, when retransmissions are triggered, this leads to an non-
   negligible additional delay in particular over GEO link.  Further
   exploiting coding techniques at application or transport layers is an
   opportunity for releasing constraints on the physical layer and
   improving the performance of SATCOM systems.

   The notations used in this document are based on the taxonomy
   document [RFC8406]:

   o  Channel and link codings are gathered in the PHY layer coding and
      are out of the scope of this document.

   o  FEC (also called Application-Level FEC) operate above the network
      layer.

   o  This document considers coding (or coding techniques or coding
      schemes) as a linear combination and not as a content coding
      (e.g., to compress a video flow).

   Figure 1 presents the status of the reliability schemes deployment in
   satellite systems.

   o  X1 embodies the source coding techniques that could be used at
      application level for instance within QUIC.  This is not specific
      to SATCOM systems since such deployment can be relevant for
      broadband Internet access discussions.

   o  X2 embodies the physical-layer techniques exploited in SATCOM
      systems (note that other coding techniques can be exploited).
      This is out of the scope of the document.

2.  A note on satellite topology

   This section describes a satellite system that follows the ETSI DVB
   standards to provide broadband Internet access.  A high-level
   description of a multi-gateway satellite network is provided.  There
   are multiple SATCOM systems, such as those dedicated to broadcasting
   TV or to IoT applications: depending on the purpose of the SATCOM
   system, ground segments are specific.  In this context, the increase
   of the available capacity that is carried out to end users and
   reliability requirements lead to multiple gateways for one unique
   satellite platform.

   In this context, Figure 2 shows an example of a multi-gateway
   satellite system.  In a multi-gateway system, some elements may be
   centralized and/or gathered: the relevance of one approach compared
   to another depends on the deployment scenario.  More information on
   these discussions and a generic SATCOM ground segment architecture
   for bidirectional Internet access can be found in [SAT2017].

   Some functional blocks aggregate the traffic of multiple users.

3.  Use-cases for improving the SATCOM system performance with coding
    techniques

   This section details use-cases where coding techniques could provide
   interesting features for SATCOM systems.

   It is worth noting that these use-cases mostly focus on the
   middleware and packetization UDP/IP of Figure 1.  There are already
   lots of recovery mechanisms at the physical-layer in currently
   deployed systems while E2E source coding is done at the application
   level.  In a multi-gateway SATCOM Internet access, the deployment
   opportunities are more relevant in specific SATCOM components such as
   the "network function" block or the "access gateway" of Figure 2.

3.1.  Two-way relay channel mode

   This use-case considers a two-way communication between end users,
   through a satellite link.  Figure 3 proposes an illustration of this
   scenario.

   Satellite terminal A sends a flow A and satellite terminal B sends a
   flow B to a coding server.  The coding server sends a combination of
   both terminal flows.  This results in non-negligible capacity savings
   and has been demonstrated [ASMS2010].  In the proposed example, a
   dedicated coding server is introduced.  Its location could be changed
   depending on the deployment use-case.  With On-Board Processing
   satellite payloads, the coding operations could be done at the
   satellite level; although this would require lots of computationnal
   ressource on-board and may not be relevant with today's payloads.

3.2.  Reliable multicast

   Using multicast servers is a way to better exploit the satellite
   broadcast capabilities.  This approach is proposed in the SHINE ESA
   project [I-D.vazquez-nfvrg-netcod-function-virtualization] [SHINE].
   This use-case considers adding redundancy to a multicast flow
   depending on what has been received by different end-users, resulting
   in non-negligible scarce resource saving.  We propose an illustration
   for this scenario in Figure 4.

   +-----------+     | |     |
   |Sat term B |-Lj}-+ |     |
   +-----------+       +-----+

      Figure 4: Network architecture for a reliable multicast with NC

   A multicast flow (M) is forwarded to both satellite terminals A and
   B.  However packet Ni (resp.  Nj) gets lost at terminal A (resp.  B),
   and terminal A (resp.  B) returns a negative acknowledgment Li (resp.
   Lj), indicating that the packet is missing.  Then either the access
   gateway or the multicast server includes a repair packet (rather than
   the individual Ni and Nj packets) in the multicast flow to let both
   terminals recover from losses.

   This could be achieved by using other multicast or broadcast systems,
   such as NACK-Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) [RFC5740] in
   situations where a feedback link is available, or File Delivery over
   Unidirectional Transport (FLUTE) [RFC6726] otherwise.  Note that both
   NORM and FLUTE are limited to block coding, none of them supporting
   sliding window encoding schemes [RFC8406].  Note that although FLUTE
   is defined as an unidirectional protocol, the RFC proposes a
   bidirectional communication method to enable full reliability
   transfer and for security purpose.

3.3.  Hybrid access

   This use-case considers the use of multiple path management with
   coding at the transport level to increase the reliability and/or the
   total capacity (using multiple path does not guarantee an improvement
   of both the reliability and the total capacity).  We propose an
   illustration for this scenario in Figure 5.  This use-case is
   inspired from the Broadband Access via Integrated Terrestrial
   Satellite Systems (BATS) project and has been published as an ETSI
   Technical Report [ETSITR2017].  This kind of architecture is also
   discussed in the TCPM working group [I-D.ietf-tcpm-converters].

   To cope with packet loss (due to either end-user mobility or
   physical-layer impairments), coding techniques could be introduced
   both at the CPE and at the concentrator.  Appart from packet losses,
   other gains could be envisionned, such as a better tolerance to out-
   of-order packets which occur when exploited links exhibit high
   asymetry in terms of RTT.  Depending on the ground architecture
   [I-D.chin-nfvrg-cloud-5g-core-structure-yang] [SAT2017], some
   equipments might be hosting both SATCOM and cellular functions.

   This use-case considers the usage of coding techniques to cope from
   cases where the end user connects to the satellite terminal with a
   Wi-Fi link that exhibits losses.  In the case of encrypted end-to-end
   applications based on UDP, PEP cannot operate.  The Wi-Fi losses
   result in an end-to-end retransmission that would harm the quality of
   experience of the end user.

   The architecture is recalled in Figure 6.

   In this use-case, adding coding techniques could prevent the end-to-
   end retransmission from occuring.

3.5.  Dealing with varying channel conditions

   This use-case considers the usage of coding techniques to cope from
   cases where channel condition can change in less than a second and
   where the physical-layer codes could not guarantee a Quasi-Error-Free
   (QEF) transmission.

   The architecture is recalled in Figure 7.  In these cases, the
   mechanisms that is exploited to adapt the physical-layer codes
   (Adaptative Coding and Modulation (ACM)) may adapt the modulation and
   coding in time: remaining errors could be recovered with higher
   layers redundancy packets.  Coding may be applied on IP packets or on
   layer-2 proprietary format packets.

   This use-case is mostly relevant when mobile users are considered or
   when the chosen band induce a required physical-layer coding that may
   change over time (Q/V bands, Ka band, etc.).  Depending on the use-
   case (e.g., very high frequency bands, mobile users) or depending on
   the deployment use-cases (e.g., performance of the network between
   each individual block), the relevance of adding coding techniques is
   different.

3.6.  Improving the gateway handovers

   This use-case considers the recovery of packets that may be lost
   during gateway handovers.  Whether this is for off-loading one given
   equipment or because the transmission quality is not the same on each
   gateway, changing the transmission gateway may be relevant.  However,
   if gateways are not properly synchronized or if the algorithm that is
   exploited to trigger gateway handovers shows a non negligible
   probability of missed detection, this may result in packet losses.
   During these critical phases, coding can be added to improve the
   reliability of the transmission and allow a seamless gateway
   handover.  Coding could be applied at either the access gateway or
   the network function block.  The control plane manager is in charge
   of taking the decision to change the communication gateway and the
   consequent routes.

   Figure 8 illustrates this use-case.

4.  Research challenges

   This section proposes to discuss few research challenges related to
   the introduction and the use of coding techniques in SATCOM systems.

Internet-Draft   Coding techniques for satellite systems       June 2019


4.1.  On the joint-use of coding techniques and congestion control in
      SATCOM systems

   SATCOM systems typically feature Performance Enhancement Proxy (PEP)
   RFC 3135 [RFC3135].  PEP usually split TCP end-to-end connections and
   forward TCP packets to the satellite baseband gateway that deals with
   layer-2 and layer-1 encapsulations.  PEP contributes to mitigate
   congestion in a SATCOM systems.  PEP could host coding mechanisms and
   thus support use-cases that have been discussed in this document.

   Deploying coding schemes at the TCP level in these equipment could be
   relevant and independent from the specific characteristics of a
   SATCOM link.  This leads to research question on the interaction
   between coding schemes and TCP congestion controls.

4.2.  On the efficient usage of satellite ressource

   The recurrent trade-off in SATCOM systems remains: how much overhead
   from redundant reliability packets can be introduced to guarantee a
   better end-user QoE while optimizing capacity usage ?

   This problem has been tackled in the past for physical-layer code,
   but there remains questions on how to adapt the overhead for, e.g.,
   the quickly varying channel conditions use-case.

4.3.  Interaction with virtualized satellite gateways and terminals

   Related to the foreseen virtualized network infrastructure, coding
   techniques could be easily deployed as VNF.  Next generation of
   SATCOM ground segments could rely on a virtualized environment.  This
   trend can also be seen in cellular networks, making these discussions
   extendable to other deployment scenarios
   [I-D.chin-nfvrg-cloud-5g-core-structure-yang].  As one example, the
   coding VNF functions deployment in a virtualized environment is
   presented in [I-D.vazquez-nfvrg-netcod-function-virtualization].

   A research challenge would be the optimization of the NFV service
   function chaining, considering a virtualized infrastructure and other
   SATCOM specific functions, to guarantee an efficient radio usage and
   easy-to-deploy SATCOM services.  Moreover, another challenge related
   to a virtualized SATCOM terminals is the management of limited
   buffered equipments.

4.4.  Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networks

   In the context of the deep-space communications, establishing
   communications from terrestrial gateways to satellite platforms can
   be a challenge.  Reliable end-to-end (E2E) communications over such

Internet-Draft   Coding techniques for satellite systems       June 2019


   links must cope with long delay and frequent link disruptions.
   Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking [RFC4838] is a solution to
   enable reliable internetworking space communications where both
   standard ad-hoc routing and E2E Internet protocols cannot be used.
   Moreover, DTN can also be seen as an alternative solution to transfer
   the data between a central PEP and a remote PEP.

   Coding enables E2E reliable communication over DTN with adaptive re-
   encoding, as proposed in [THAI15].  In this case, the use-cases
   proposed in Section 3.5 would legitimize the usage of coding within
   the DTN stack to improve the channel utilization and the E2E
   transmission delay.  In this context, the use of erasure coding
   techniques inside a Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems
   (CCSDS) architecture has been specified in [CCSDS-131.5-O-1].  A
   research challenge would be on how such coding can be integrated in
   the IETF DTN stack.

5.  Conclusion

   This document discuses some opportunities to introduce coding
   techniques at a wider scale in satellite telecommunications systems.

   Even though this document focuses on satellite systems, it is worth
   pointing out that some scenarios proposed may be relevant to other
   wireless telecommunication systems.  As one example, the generic
   architecture proposed in Figure 2 may be mapped to cellular networks
   as follows: the 'network function' block gather some of the functions
   of the Evolved Packet Core subsystem, while the 'access gateway' and
   'physical gateway' blocks gather the same type of functions as the
   Universal Mobile Terrestrial Radio Access Network.  This mapping
   extends the opportunities identified in this draft since they may be
   also relevant for cellular networks.

8.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations are inherent to any access network, and in
   particular SATCOM systems.  The use of FEC or Network Coding in
   SATCOM also comes with risks (e.g., a single corrupted redundant
   packet may propagate to several flows when they are protected

   However this is not specific to the SATCOM use-case and this document
