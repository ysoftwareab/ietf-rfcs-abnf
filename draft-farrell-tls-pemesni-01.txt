Abstract

   Encrypted ClientHello key pairs need to be configured into TLS
   servers, some of which can be built with different TLS libraries, so
   there is a benefit and little cost in documenting a file format to
   use for these, similar to how RFC7468 defines other PEM file formats.

1.  Introduction

   Encrypted ClientHello (ECHO) [I-D.ietf-tls-esni] for TLS1.3 [RFC8446]
   defines a confidentiality mechanism for server names and other
   ClientHello content in TLS.  That requires publication of an
   ECHOConfig data structure in an HTTPSSVC RR
   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-svcb-httpssvc] in the DNS.  An ECHOConfig structure
   contains the public component of a key pair that will typically be
   periodically (re-)generated by some key manager for a TLS server.
   TLS servers then need to be configured to use these key pairs, and
   given that various TLS servers can be built with different TLS
   libraries, there is a benefit in having a standard format for ECHO
   key pairs, just as was done with [RFC7468].

   [[This idea could: a) wither on the vine, b) be published as it's own
   RFC, or c) end up as a PR for [I-D.ietf-tls-esni].  There is no
   absolute need for this to be in the RFC that defines ECHO, so (b)
   seems feasible if there's enough interest, hence this draft.  The
   source for this is in https://github.com/sftcd/pemesni/ PRs are
   welcome there too.]]

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  ECHOConfig file

   The public and private keys MUST both be PEM encoded.  The file
   contains the catenation of the PEM encoding of the private key
   followed by the PEM encoding of the public key plus additional data.
   The private key MUST be encoded as a PKCS#8 PrivateKey.  The public
   key MUST be the base64 encoded form of the ECHOConfig value that is

   published in the DNS.  The string "ECHOCONFIG" MUST be used in the
   PEM file delimiter for the public key.

   There MUST only be one key pair in each file even if a server
   publishes multiple public keys in one ECHOConfig structure.

4.  Security Considerations

   Storing cryptographic keys in files leaves them vulnerable should
   anyone get shell access to the TLS server machine.  So: Don't let
   that happen:-)

5.  Acknowledgements

   TBD, as needed

6.  IANA Considerations

   There are none so this section can be deleted later.
