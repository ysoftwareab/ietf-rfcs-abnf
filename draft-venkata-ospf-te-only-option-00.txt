1.0  Abstract

   OSPF is a link state routing protocol used for IP-network 
   topology discovery using different types of Link State 
   Advertisements. The resulting Link State Database (LSDB) is
   used to compute IP address forwarding table based on 
   shortest-path criteria. OSPF has been extended to support Traffic 
   Engineering, QoS in packet and non-packet networks. These has
   been a serious concern regarding scalability and convergence of
   information in large networks. 

   This memo documents an optional OSPF capability to support TE only 
   functionality. This OSPF TE Only option is to support existing and 
   future Traffic Engineering extensions for packet and/or non-packet
   networks with out exchanging any hop-by-hop routing information. 
   This is accomplished by exchanging T-bit option in OSPF Hello 
   packets. This gives flexibility of supporting larger TE areas,
   increased scalability and improved convergence.


2.0  Overview

   Over the last several years the OSPF routing protocol [OSPF] has 
   been widely deployed throughout the Internet. As a result of this
   deployment and the evolution of networking technology, OSPF has 
   been extended to support many options; this evolution will 
   obviously continue.

   This is an effort to extend OSPF to support TE Only capability with
   out exchanging any hop-by-hop routing information (like Router LSAs,
   Network LSAs etc) in an OSPF area.

   OSPF-TE sets out to discover TE network topology and perform
   collection and dissemination of TE metrics within the TE network.
   This results in the generation of an independent TE-LSDB, that
   would permit computation of TE circuit paths. In other words,

Internet Draft              OSPF TE Only Option               April 2002


   TE link-state information is totally independent of hop-by-hop link
   state information and logic flow in IGPs (both OSPF and ISIS). 
   TE LSAs have all the information about logical/physical Links/Nodes
   in the system. 

   For example, in the same routing domain, one can use ISIS for IP 
   hop-by-hop routing and OSPF-TE for exchanging just TE information 
   and updating TE Topology DataBase. OSPF will not exchange any other 
   information for hop-by-hop routing purpose.
   
   Effectively, if we are able to make any IGP for TE only purpose 
   then that is nothing but a different protocol exclusively for 
   exchanging TE information. Doing this way has some advantages in 
   scalability and information convergence as outlined in section 2.0.
  

2.1  Motivation                     

   At present OSPF is extended to support Traffic Engineering [OSPF-TE]
   GMPLS [OSPF-GMPLS] and Differentiated services. There has been lot
   of discussion about the convergence and scalability of this 
   information in large IGPs confined areas. 
  
   Routing Information needs faster convergence when compared to TE 
   information. Because, if LSDBs in all routers are not identical then,
   that may cause routing loops. But, if TE information is not 
   propagated then that won't cause any routing loops, rather might 
   cause (unwanted) MPLS LSPs being setup/rejected.

   As a general rule, a TE network is likely to generate significantly
   more control traffic than a native OSPF network. The excess traffic
   is almost directly proportional to the rate at which TE circuits are
   setup and torn down within an autonomous system. It is important to 
   ensure that TE database synchronizations happen quickly when 
   compared to the aggregate circuit setup an teardown rates.

   With this extension, the "TE information" exchange is out-of-band 
   w.r.t regular hop-by-hop routing information exchange. Out-of-band 
   flooding gives better performance improvement in convergence.
   So, disseminating hop-by-hop Routing link-state information and TE
   link-state information is mutually beneficial to hop-by-hop routing
   computations and TE-LSPs.

   With this extension, effectively we can have the "TE Area" boundary
   totally different from "Routing Area Boundary".

   For example, "OSPF-TE Only" can be configured on bigger range than
   ISIS Routing Area. Effectively, we will be doing CSPF on multi-area
   (at least w.r.t ISIS). So that, we can have different combinations

   of OSPF and ISIS running in the same routing domain performing 
   different set of things.

   If the logic flow of TE and Routing Info in IGPs are different,
   operators can have flexibility of choosing (based on their 
   requirements and performance measurements) different combinations 
   of IGPs performing different set of actions in the same routing 
   domain.

   From software development perspective, OSPF-TE Only takes less lot 
   of space when compared to classical OSPF. Much of complex code in 
   OSPF can be made independent of TE. This leads to easy maintenance
   and room for future extensions.
      
   All this can be done with out changing current (deployed) OSPF 
   extensions but with one option exchange in Hello packets.


2.2 Proposed Solution

   The proposed solution is to exchange a T-bit option in OSPF Hello 
   packets. When the bit is set, Router is not willing to receive any
   LSAs except TE-LSAs and the Router itself is not going to generate 
   any type of LSAs except TE-LSAs.


3.0  Implementation Details

3.1  The T-bit

   An opaque-capable TE Only router learns of its neighbor's opaque
   capability at the "Hello Protocol handshake process". A neighbor
   is TE Only capable if and only if it sets T-bit in the Hello packets
   options fields. Also note that, a router is TE Only capable if and
   only if it supports [OSPF-OPAQUE].

   When used in Hello packets, the TE Only options field allows a 
   router to reject a neighbor because of capability mismatch. There
   is no requirement that all routers in a router domain and/or in
   OSPF area must agree on this TE Only option. Routers, which support
   this capability and router which doesn't may co-exist in the same
   routing domain. 


4.0 Security Considerations

   All the above extensions are part of normal OSPF procedure w.r.t 
   exchanging/flooding TE LSAs and authentication procedures. This memo
   does not create any new security issues for the OSPF protocol. 
   Security considerations for the base OSPF protocol are covered in 
   [OSPF].

5.0 Future Work

1. The performance analysis of above extension in order to improve 
      convergence time and scalability are under study. 
2. Extending the above work to multi-area extensions and route 
   servers are under consideration. 
3. Extensions to silent-mode TE listeners (which serve as Topology
Data base servers in area borders) are under study.
4. ISIS routing protocol also can be extended in a similar fashion.

Appendix A: The Options Field

      The OSPF options field is present in OSPF Hello packets, Database
      Description packets and all link state advertisements.  See 
      [OSPF]Appendix A.2 and [OSPF-OPAQUE] Appendix A.1 for a 
      description of the options field.  Seven bits are assigned but 
      only one (the T-bit) is described completely in this section.

                   The Hello and Opaque LSA options field

      T-bit:  The T-bit is used only in the Hello Packets and LSA header.  
              When the bit is set, Router is not willing to receive any
              LSAs except TE-LSAs and the Router itself is not going to 
              generate any type of LSAs except TE-LSAs.
