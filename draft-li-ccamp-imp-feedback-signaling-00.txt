1.  Introduction

   WSON technology was deployed to provide an end to end optical path
   that can be used to carry client signals transparently.  From the
   perspective of control plane, the light path provision needs to
   resolve the problems including routing, wavelength assignment (WA)
   and impairment validation (IV).  As detailed in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-wson-impairments], there are three main frameworks to
   resolve these problems: 1 Combined Routing, WA and IV; 2 Separated
   routing, WA or IV; 3 Distributed WA and/or IV.  Among the three
   processes, distributed WA and/or IV can eliminate the need to
   distributed wavelength availability and impairment characteristics of
   network elements and links via routing protocols or other means.  The
   approach of distributed process can be accomplished by extending to
   the RSVP-TE signaling protocol of [RFC3471] and [RFC3473] to collect
   the accumulated impairment parameters hop by hop and validated the
   available wavelgnth at the egress node.  The examples of such an
   approach can be found in [I-D.martinelli-ccamp-optical-imp-signaling]
   and [I-D.agraz-ccamp-wson-impairment-rsvp].

   However, in these scenarios, the ingress and transit nodes do not
   know the detailed impairment parameters of other nodes at first, so
   the establishment of the LSP by such an approach may suffer a much
   higher blocking probability.

   In this memo we propose feedback control of some parameters related
   to impairment evaluation results so as to provide a relatively higher
   probability in setting up a LSP.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Motivation

   According to ITU-T recommendation [G.680]and
   [I-D.bernstein-wson-impairment-info], the performance of an optical
   network is subjected to several parameters including optical signal
   noise ratio (OSNR), chromatic dispersion (CD), polarization mode
   dispersion (PMD), cross talk (XT) (considering the approximated
   impairment estimation situation ).  Besides, the impairment tolerance
   has a close connection with the signal bit-rate, modulation format
   and Forwarding Error Code (FEC) used in the path.

   For a point to point lambda connection in WSON, the channel power,
   modulation format, FEC, dispersion compensation (electronic
   dispersion compensate technology) may be configured in the ingress
   and egress nodes.  And in the passive transit nodes without 3R or
   wavelength conversion, the channel power may be adjusted, while in
   the active transit nodes, the parameters mentioned above as in the
   ingress or egress ends may also be configured.  According to [G.680],
   adjusting the optical channel power will contribute to significant
   change of OSNR.  It is demonstrated that the channel (corresponding
   to a wavelength) power of the transmitter can be configured by
   adjusting the laser's current of the ingress node and the channel
   attenuation at the others.  Then adjusting the channel pre/post
   electronic dispersion compensation of the transmitter or receiver
   respectively will change the total dispersion tolerance.  While, in
   the 100G and above or future ultra-wideband network, per channel CD,
   PMD passive compensation on all nodes may be able to be deployed to
   further solve the dispersion tolerance.  The selection of all the
   parameters mentioned above spread in the network elements will have a
   direct impact on the impairment validation results.

   However, in the existing distributed WA and IV schemes, these
   parameters are not mentioned to be configured in signaling which have
   an implication of system-default value.  As the situation of every
   LSP's setup can be so different that these system-default or previous
   defined parameters may lead to a relative higher blocking probability
   in impairment validation.  Hence, a new signaling procedure is
   introduced to record the parameters that is configurable in the Path
   message and carry out feedback control in the Resv message leading to
   a higher probability in establishing the LSP.


4.  RSVP-TE extensions

   In order to realize feedback control of the parameters, a variable
   impairment sub-TLV and a Configuration Route Object (CRO) are defined
   in the Path and Resv message respectively.  In the signaling
   procedure, the egress node needs to know which nodes among the path
   to be configured after collecting all the impairment information, so
   the configurable node and interface addresses MUST be known.
   [RFC3209] has defined the Record Route Object (RRO) to record the
   attribute of the node and corresponding interface when establishing a
   new LSP.  This document extended the application of this object by
   including a variable impairment sub-TLV to carry the configurable
   parameters along the path.  The format of the variable impairment sub
   TLV is illustrated in figure 1:

   PMD), etc.

   might be OPTIONAL with the parameter type of modulation format and

   supported modulation format and FEC type, Whiel for

   elements: the lower and the upper limit of the parameters.

   Once the egress node has collected all the impairment information, it
   MUST decide whether to configure the involved nodes along the path to
   establish the LSP after calculation.  The calculation procedure can
   be referred to [G.680] and [G.sup39].  The egress node finds that
   only if some parameters have been configured, the selected wavelength
   label can satisfy the impairment requirement.  A reliable message
   MUST be used to configure the parameter to the specified nodes.  So,
   a newly defined object named Configuration Route Object (CRO) is
   introduced in the Resv message to configure the involved nodes in the
   path.  This object MUST include the specified node address and
   calculated parameter values.  The process procedure of the CRO object
   is the same as the Label object that the Resv message MUST not be
   passed to the next hop unless the configuration is done.  The format
   of the CRO object is illustrated in figure 3.

   value replaces the system default value in the parameter sub-sub TLV,
   while the paramter range SHOULD be omitted.


5.  Procedure for distributed impairment validation

   This section details the distributed wavelength assignment and
   impairment validation with the extended RSVP-TE signaling mentioned
   in this doucoment by the following procedure:

   o  The ingress node first checks out the wavelength usage information
      on the outgoing interface, and fills the available wavelength in
      the Label set object in the path message.  Then it records the
      configurable parameters in the extended RRO object including
      (modulation format ,FEC, power, attenuation, etc.).  The
      accumulated four approximated impairment parameters (OSNR, CD,
      PMD, XT) with the default parameters can be carried in the LSP
      required attribute object as described in
      [I-D.martinelli-ccamp-optical-imp-signaling].
   o  The transit nodes check their own available wavelength on the
      outgoing interfaces and prune the Label set object.  Then update
      the four accumulated impairment parameters with the default
      parameters respectively.  The control plane will inspect that if
      these nodes have any configurable parameters, if they do (For
      example, the channel attenuation can be adjusted), the parameters
      will be recorded to the RRO object as mentioned in section.
   o  Once the egress node has received the path message, it will
      firstly check if there are any available labels that satisfy the
      wavelength continuity constraints.  If there exist available
      wavelengths and the corresponding optical impairment is
      acceptable, the process procedure of the Resv message is the
      similar to [I-D.martinelli-ccamp-optical-imp-signaling].  The
      egress node SHOULD select the local transponders of the node and
      choose the wavelength in the label object, and signal type
      (modulation, FEC) in the CRO object respectively in the Resv
      message.  If the egress node finds that there are available
      wavelengths only when some impairment parameters are adjusted
      among certain nodes, the calculated parameters to satisfy the
      impairment validation requirment were put in the CRO object
      carried by Resv message to configure the involved network element
      among the path.  It is worth to note that which nodes and
      parameters are going to be configured is due to the egress's local
      policy, that is to say, not every configurable node MUST be
      configured.
   o  Once received the Resv message, the transit nodes will check the
      CRO object if they need some parameter configuration.  If they
      need, the Resv message MUST not be transferred to the next hop
      unless the selected wavelength cross-connection and parameter



Li                      Expires September 8, 2011               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        Impairment feedback signaling           March 2011


      configuration have been finished.
   o  The ingress node finally choose the selected wavelength, and
      signal type to the local transponder and checks if there are any
      parameters need to be configured according to the CRO Object.
      Once the wavelength cross-connection and the parameter
      configuration process are done, the LSP has been successfully
      established.

   Note that in the path message, any node that cannot recognize the
   extended variable sub object MUST ignore it and transfer the RRO
   object transparently.  While in the Resv message, if the specify node
   cannot recognize the CRO object or a failure in configuration MUST
   reject the setup of the LSP and sent a ResvError message with Error
   code "unknown object" or "CRO configuration failure".
