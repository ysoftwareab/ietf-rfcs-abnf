<h1><br />Packet Loss and Delay
    Measurement for the MPLS Transport Profile<br />draft-ietf-mpls-tp-loss-delay-00</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>An essential Operations, Administration and Maintenance requirement
      of the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is the ability to monitor
      performance metrics for packet loss and one-way and two-way delay for
      MPLS-TP pseudowires, Label Switched Paths, and Sections. This document
      specifies protocol mechanisms to facilitate the efficient and accurate
      measurement of these performance metrics.

<a name="rfc.section.1.1.1"></a><h3>1.1.1.&nbsp;
Requirements for Packet Loss Measurement</h3>

<p>The MPLS-TP OAM toolset must provide a function to enable the
          quantification of packet loss ratio over a PW, LSP or
          Section.
</p>
<p>The loss of a packet is defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC2680'>[RFC2680]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Almes, G., Kalidindi, S., and M. Zekauskas, &ldquo;A One-way Packet Loss Metric for IPPM,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a>
          (Section 2.4).  This definition is used here.
</p>
<p>Packet loss ratio is defined here to be the ratio of the
          number of user packets lost to the total number of user packets
          sent during a defined time interval.
</p>
<p>This function may either be performed pro-actively or
          on-demand.
</p>
<p>This function should be performed between End Points of PWs,
          LSPs and Sections.
</p>
<p>It should be possible to rely on user traffic to perform this
          function.
</p>
<p>The protocol solution(s) developed to perform this function
          must apply to point-to-point co-routed bidirectional LSPs,
          point-to-point associated bidirectional LSPs, point-to-point
          unidirectional LSPs and point-to-multipoint (unidirectional)
          LSPs.

<a name="rfc.section.1.1.2"></a><h3>1.1.2.&nbsp;
Requirements for Delay Measurement</h3>

<p>The MPLS-TP OAM toolset must provide a function to enable the
          quantification of the one-way, and if appropriate, the two-way,
          delay of a PW, LSP or Section.
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The one-way delay is defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC2679'>[RFC2679]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Almes, G., Kalidindi, S., and M. Zekauskas, &ldquo;A One-way Delay Metric for IPPM,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a>
            to be the time elapsed from the start of transmission of the
            first bit of a packet by an End Point until the reception of
            the last bit of that packet by the other End Point.
</li>
<li>The two-way delay is defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC2681'>[RFC2681]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Almes, G., Kalidindi, S., and M. Zekauskas, &ldquo;A Round-trip Delay Metric for IPPM,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a>
            to be the time elapsed from the start of transmission of the
            first bit of a packet by an End Point until the reception of
            the last bit of that packet by the same End Point.
</li>
</ul><p>
          
</p>
<p>Two-way delay may be quantified using data traffic loopback
          at the remote End Point of the PW, LSP or Section.
</p>
<p>Accurate quantification of one-way delay may require clock
          synchronization, the means for which are outside the scope of
          this document.
</p>
<p>This function should be performed on-demand and may be
          performed pro-actively.
</p>
<p>This function should be performed between End Points of PWs,
          LSPs and Sections.
</p>
<p>In addition to point-to-point co-routed bidirectional LSPs,
          the protocol solution(s) developed to perform this function must
          also apply to point-to-point associated bidirectional LSPs,
          point-to-point unidirectional LSPs and point-to-multipoint
          (unidirectional) LSPs, but only to enable the quantification of
          the one-way delay.

Protocol Summary</h3>

<p>This document specifies two closely-related protocols, one for

            delay over MPLS-TP pseudowires and sections, over associated
            and co-routed bidirectional point-to-point MPLS-TP LSPs, and
            over unidirectional point-to-point and point-to-multipoint
            MPLS-TP LSPs.
</li>
<li>The LM and DM protocols support pro-active and on-demand
            modes of operation.
</li>
<li>The LM and DM protocols use a simple query/response model
            over bidirectional connections that allows a single node - the

            the connection.
</li>
<li>The LM and DM protocols use query messages to measure the
            loss or delay of a unidirectional connection.  The measurement
            can either be carried out at the downstream node(s) or at the
            querier if an out-of-band return path is available.

<li>The LM and DM protocols do not require that the transmit
            and receive interfaces be the same at an endpoint of a
            bidirectional connection.
</li>
<li>The DM protocol is stateless.
</li>
<li>The LM protocol is "almost" stateless: loss is computed as
            a delta between successive messages, and thus the data
            associated with the last message received must be
            retained.
</li>
<li>The LM protocol provides perfect loss measurement if the
            necessary implementation support is available.
</li>
<li>The LM protocol supports both 32-bit and 64-bit packet
            counters.
</li>
<li>The DM protocol supports multiple timestamp formats, and
            provides a simple means for the two endpoints of a
            bidirectional connection to agree on a preferred format.  This
            procedure reduces to a triviality for implementations
            supporting only a single timestamp format.
</li>
<li>The DM protocol supports varying the measurement message
            size in order to measure delays associated with different
            packet sizes.

Overview</h3>

<p>The basic procedures for measuring loss and delay over a
      bidirectional connection are conceptually simple. The following figure
      shows the reference scenario.
</p><br /><hr class="insert" />
<a name="ov_fig"></a>
<div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto'><pre>
          T1              T2

|       |&lt;- - - - - - - - - |       |
+-------+\     Response    /+-------+
          T4              T3
</pre></div><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" align="center"><tr><td align="center"><font face="monaco, MS Sans Serif" size="1"><b>&nbsp;Figure&nbsp;1&nbsp;</b></font><br /></td></tr></table><hr class="insert" />

<p>The figure shows a bidirectional connection between two nodes, A and
      B, and illustrates the temporal reference points T1-T4 associated with a
      measurement operation that takes place at A. The operation consists of A
      sending a query message to B, and B sending back a response. Each
      reference point indicates the point in time at which either the query or
      the response message is transmitted or received over the connection.
</p>
<p>In this situation, A can arrange to measure the packet loss over the
      connection in the forward and reverse directions by sending Loss
      Measurement (LM) query messages to B each of which contains the count of
      packets transmitted prior to time T1 over the connection to B (A_TxP).
      When the message reaches B, it appends two values and reflects the
      message back to A: the count of packets received prior to time T2 over
      the connection from A (B_RxP), and the count of packets transmitted
      prior to time T3 over the connection to A (B_TxP). When the response
      reaches A, it appends a fourth value, the count of packets received
      prior to time T4 over the connection from B (A_RxP).
</p>
<p>These four counter values enable A to compute the desired loss
      statistics. Because the transmit count at A and the receive count at B
      (and vice versa) may not be synchronized at the time of the first
      message, and to limit the effects of counter wrap, the loss is computed
      in the form of a delta between messages.
</p>
<p>To measure at A the delay over the connection to B, a Delay
      Measurement (DM) query message is sent from A to B containing a
      timestamp recording the instant at which it is transmitted,
      i.e.&nbsp;T1. When the message reaches B, a timestamp is added recording
      the instant at which it is received (T2). The message can now be
      reflected from B to A, with B adding its transmit timestamp (T3) and A
      adding its receive timestamp (T4). These four timestamps enable A to
      compute the one-way delay in each direction, as well as the two-way
      delay for the connection. The one-way delay computations require that
      the clocks of A and B be synchronized; mechanisms for clock
      synchronization are outside the scope of this document.
</p>
<p>In the case of a unidirectional connection rooted at A, the first
      half of each of the above procedures can be carried out to measure the
      forward one-way loss and delay associated with the connection.  At this
      point the measurement can either take place at the terminal node(s) of
      the connection rather than at A, or an out-of-band channel can be used,
      if available, to communicate the data back to A.
</p>
<p>In the context of MPLS-TP, LM and DM messages flow over the Generic
      Associated Channel (G-ACh) <a class='info' href='#RFC5586'>[RFC5586]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bocci, M., Vigoureux, M., and S. Bryant, &ldquo;MPLS Generic Associated Channel,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> of an MPLS-TP
      pseudowire, LSP, or Section.  The term "connection" is used in this
      document to mean "pseudowire, LSP, or Section".  Although this document
      often speaks of "measuring the loss or delay associated with a
      connection" for simplicity, LM and DM actually occur with respect to a
      particular class of packets flowing over a connection.  This is
      discussed in more detail in <a class='info' href='#ppqos'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Packet Profiles and Quality of Service</span><span>)</span></a>.

<a name="rfc.section.2.1"></a><h3>2.1.&nbsp;
Implementation Considerations</h3>

<p>The challenge in carrying out the above procedures lies with the
        implementation. For accurate loss measurement to occur, packets must
        not be sent between the time the transmit count for an outbound LM
        message is determined and the time the message is actually
        transmitted. Similarly, packets must not be received and processed
        between the time an LM message is received and the time the receive
        count for the message is determined. For accurate delay measurement,
        timestamps must be recorded in DM messages at a point in time as close
        as possible to when the message is actually transmitted or received
        over the connection.
</p>
<p>These accuracy requirements imply that a hardware-based forwarding
        implementation may require hardware support for the processing of LM
        and DM messages. An important consideration of the LM/DM protocol and
        message format is therefore support for efficient hardware
        processing.
</p>
<p>In situations where such accuracy is not required, or the necessary
        level of support is not available, an implementation MAY still
        generate and respond to LM and DM messages but SHOULD make its
        accuracy limitations clear to the user. In general the DM procedures
        described in this document remain viable under these conditions, but
        the procedures for LM may be inadequate.
</p>
<p>The LM procedures described in this document have the advantage of
        providing perfect packet loss accounting if the necessary
        implementation support is available.  This is a desirable capability
        in an LM protocol for MPLS-TP given that loss levels for typical
        MPLS-TP connections are expected to be quite low, and that even small
        amounts of loss on such connections may be unacceptable.  This
        capability, however, may well come at the expense of more costly
        hardware, and in some environments this cost may be prohibitive.  Thus
        it is desirable to define an additional set of LM procedures for
        MPLS-TP that support deployments in which perfect loss accounting is
        not required.  Such alternative procedures rely on the generation of
        either existing or new MPLS-TP OAM message types, which are subjected
        to loss accounting as a proxy for user traffic in order to infer
        approximate loss levels of the latter.  This alternative approach to
        LM is for further study and will be described in a companion
        document.

<a name="rfc.section.2.2"></a><h3>2.2.&nbsp;
Packet Loss Measurement</h3>

<p>Suppose a bidirectional connection such as an MPLS-TP pseudowire,
        bidirectional LSP, or Section exists between the LSRs A and B. The
        objective is to measure at A the following two quantities associated
        with the connection: </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>A_TxLoss (transmit loss): the number of packets transmitted by
            A over the connection but not received at B;
</p>
<p>A_RxLoss (receive loss): the number of packets transmitted by B
            over the connection but not received at A.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is accomplished by initiating a Loss Measurement (LM)
        operation at A, which consists of transmission of a sequence of LM
        query messages (LM[1], LM[2], ...) over the connection at a specified
        rate, such as one every 100 milliseconds. Each message LM[n] contains
        the following value: </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>A_TxP[n]: the total count of packets transmitted by A over the
            connection prior to the time this message is transmitted.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When such a message is received at B, the following value is
        recorded in the message: </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>B_RxP[n]: the total count of packets received by B over the
            connection at the time this message is received (excluding the
            message itself).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point, B inserts an appropriate response code into the
        message and transmits it back to A, recording within it the following
        value: </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>B_TxP[n]: the total count of packets transmitted by B over the
            connection prior to the time this response is transmitted.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the message response is received back at A, the following
        value is recorded in the message: </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>A_RxP[n]: the total count of packets received by A over the
            connection at the time this response is received (excluding the
            message itself).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The transmit loss A_TxLoss[n-1,n] and receive loss A_RxLoss[n-1,n]
        within the measurement interval marked by the messages LM[n-1] and
        LM[n] are computed by A as follows:
</p>
<p>A_TxLoss[n-1,n] = (A_TxP[n] - A_TxP[n-1]) - (B_RxP[n] - B_RxP[n-1])
        <br />
 A_RxLoss[n-1,n] = (B_TxP[n] - B_TxP[n-1]) - (A_RxP[n] -
        A_RxP[n-1])
</p>
<p>where the arithmetic is modulo the counter size.
</p>
<p>The derived values </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>A_TxLoss = A_TxLoss[1,2] + A_TxLoss[2,3] + ...
</p>
<p>A_RxLoss = A_RxLoss[1,2] + A_RxLoss[2,3] + ...
</p>
</blockquote><p> are updated each time a response to an LM message is
        received and processed, and represent the total transmit and receive
        loss over the connection since the LM operation was initiated.
</p>
<p>When computing the values A_TxLoss[n-1,n] and A_RxLoss[n-1,n] the
        possibility of counter wrap must be taken into account. Consider for
        example the values of the A_TxP counter at times n-1 and n. Clearly if
        A_TxP[n] is allowed to wrap to 0 and then beyond to a value equal to
        or greater than A_TxP[n-1], the computation of an unambiguous
        A_TxLoss[n-1,n] value will be impossible. Therefore the LM message
        rate MUST be sufficiently high, given the counter size and the speed
        and minimum packet size of the underlying connection, that this
        condition cannot arise. For example, a 32-bit counter for a 100 Gbps
        link with a minimum packet size of 64 bytes can wrap in 2^32 /
        (10^11/(64*8)) = ~22 seconds, which is therefore an upper bound on the
        LM message interval under such conditions.

Delay Measurement</h3>

<p>Suppose a bidirectional connection such as an MPLS-TP pseudowire,
        bidirectional LSP, or Section exists between the LSRs A and B. The
        objective is to measure at A one or more of the following quantities
        associated with the connection: </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The one-way delay associated with the forward (A to B)
            direction of the connection;
</li>
<li>The one-way delay associated with the reverse (B to A)
            direction of the connection;
</li>
<li>The two-way delay (A to B to A) associated with the
            connection.
</li>
</ul>

<p>In the case of two-way delay, there are actually two possible
        metrics of interest.  The "strict" two-way delay is the sum of the
        one-way delays in each direction and reflects the two-way delay of the
        connection itself, irrespective of processing delays within the remote
        endpoint B.  The "loose" two-way delay is the definition of two-way
        delay stated in <a class='info' href='#dmreq'>Section&nbsp;1.1.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Requirements for Delay Measurement</span><span>)</span></a> and includes in addition any
        delay associated with remote endpoint processing.
</p>
<p>Measurement of the one-way delay quantities requires that the
        clocks of A and B be synchronized, whereas the two-way delay can be
        measured directly even when this is not the case (provided A and B
        have stable clocks).
</p>
<p>The measurement is accomplished by sending a Delay Measurement (DM)
        query message over the connection to B which contains the following
        timestamp: </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>T1: the time the DM query message is transmitted from A.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the message arrives at B, the following timestamp is recorded
        in the message: </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>T2: the time the DM query message is received at B.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point B inserts an appropriate response code into the
        message and transmits it back to A, recording within it the following
        timestamp: </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>T3: the time the DM response message is transmitted from B.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the message arrives back at A, the following timestamp is
        recorded in the message: </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>T4: the time the DM response message is received back at A.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point, A can compute the strict two-way delay associated with the
        connection as
          </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>strict two-way delay = (T4 - T1) - (T3 - T2)
</p>
</blockquote><p>
        and the loose two-way delay as
          </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>loose two-way delay = T4 - T1.
</p>
</blockquote><p>
        
</p>
<p>If the clocks of A and B are known at A to be synchronized, then
        both one-way delay values, as well as the strict two-way delay, can be
        computed at A as
          </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>forward one-way delay = T2 - T1
</p>
<p>reverse one-way delay = T4 - T3
</p>
<p>strict two-way delay = forward delay + reverse delay.

<a name="rfc.section.2.3.1"></a><h3>2.3.1.&nbsp;
Timestamp Format</h3>

<p>There are two significant timestamp formats in common use: the
          timestamp format of the Internet standard Network Time Protocol
          (NTP), described in <a class='info' href='#RFC1305'>[RFC1305]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mills, D., &ldquo;Network Time Protocol (Version 3) Specification, Implementation,&rdquo; March&nbsp;1992.</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#RFC2030'>[RFC2030]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mills, D., &ldquo;Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) Version 4 for IPv4, IPv6 and OSI,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1996.</span><span>)</span></a>, and the timestamp format used in the IEEE
          1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) <a class='info' href='#IEEE1588'>[IEEE1588]<span> (</span><span class='info'>IEEE, &ldquo;1588-2008 IEEE Standard for a Precision Clock Synchronization           Protocol for Networked Measurement and Control Systems,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>[Editor's note: There are actually two PTP timestamp formats: the
          1588v1 format consists of a 32-bit seconds field and a 32-bit
          nanoseconds field; in 1588v2 the seconds field was extended to 48
          bits.]
</p>
<p>The NTP format has the advantages of wide use and long deployment
          in the Internet, and was specifically designed to make the
          computation of timestamp differences as simple and efficient as
          possible. On the other hand, there is also now a significant
          deployment of equipment designed to support the PTP format.
</p>
<p>The approach taken in this document is therefore to include in DM
          messages fields which identify the timestamp formats used by the two
          devices involved in a DM operation. This implies that an LSR
          attempting to carry out a DM operation may be faced with the problem
          of computing with and possibly reconciling different timestamp
          formats. Support for multiple timestamp formats is OPTIONAL. An
          implementation SHOULD, however, make clear which timestamp formats
          it supports and the extent of its support for computation with and
          reconciliation of different formats for purposes of delay
          measurement.
</p>
<p>In recognition of the wide deployment, particularly in
          hardware-based timing implementations, of IEEE 1588 PTP, the PTP
          timestamp format is the default format used in DM messages. This
          format MUST be supported.

<a name="rfc.section.2.4"></a><h3>2.4.&nbsp;
Delay Variation Measurement</h3>

<p>Packet Delay Variation <a class='info' href='#RFC3393'>[RFC3393]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Demichelis, C. and P. Chimento, &ldquo;IP Packet Delay Variation Metric for IP Performance Metrics (IPPM),&rdquo; November&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> is another
        performance metric important in some applications. The PDV of a pair
        of packets within a stream of packets is defined for a selected pair
        of packets in the stream going from measurement point MP1 to
        measurement point MP2. The PDV is the difference between the one-way
        delay of the selected packets.
</p>
<p>A PDV measurement can therefore be derived from successive delay
        measurements obtained through the procedures in <a class='info' href='#ov_delay'>Section&nbsp;2.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Delay Measurement</span><span>)</span></a>. An important point regarding PDV
        measurement, however, is that it can be carried out based on one-way
        delay measurements even when the clocks of the two systems involved in
        those measurements are not synchronized.

Unidirectional Connections</h3>

<p>In the case that the connection from A to (B1, ..., Bk) is
        unidirectional, i.e.&nbsp;is a unidirectional LSP, LM and DM
        measurements can be carried out at B1, ..., Bk instead of at A.
</p>
<p>For LM this is accomplished by initiating an LM operation at A and
        carrying out the same procedures as for bidirectional connections,
        except that no responses from B1, ..., Bk to A are generated. Instead,
        each terminal node B uses the A_TxP and B_RxP values in the LM
        messages it receives to compute the receive loss associated with the
        connection in essentially the same way as described previously,

<p>The overview of the bidirectional measurement process presented in
        <a class='info' href='#ov'>Section&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Overview</span><span>)</span></a> is also applicable when the transmit and receive
        interfaces at A or B differ from one another, as may occur when the
        connection is an MPLS-TP LSP that is not co-routed.  Some additional
        considerations, however, do apply in this case:
          </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>If the transmit and receive interfaces reside on different line
            cards, the clocks of those line cards must be synchronized in
            order to compute the two-way delay.
</li>
<li>The DM protocol specified in this document requires that the
            timestamp formats used by the interfaces that receive a DM query
            and transmit a DM response agree.
</li>
<li>The LM protocol specified in this document supports both 32-bit
            and 64-bit counter sizes, but the use of 32-bit counters at any of
            the up to four interfaces involved in an LM operation will result
            in 32-bit LM calculations for both directions of the
            connection.
</li>
</ul><p>
          [Editor's note: The last two restrictions could be relaxed if
          desired, at the expense of some additional protocol complexity.]

        transmits the response, Counter 1 is set to B_TxP. When the response
        is received at A, Counter 2 is set to A_RxP. All counter values MUST
        be in network byte order.
</p>
<p>When a 32-bit counter value is written to one of the counter

          sending a sequence (LM[1], LM[2], ...) of LM query messages over the
          connection at a specific rate and processing the responses received,
          if any. As described in <a class='info' href='#ov_loss'>Section&nbsp;2.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Packet Loss Measurement</span><span>)</span></a>, the packet
          loss associated with the connection during the operation is computed
          as a delta between successive messages; these deltas can be
          accumulated to obtain a running total of the packet loss for the
          connection.
</p>
<p>The query message transmission rate MUST be sufficiently high,
          given the LM message counter size (which can be either 32 or 64
          bits) and the speed and minimum packet size of the underlying
          connection, that the ambiguity condition noted in <a class='info' href='#ov_loss'>Section&nbsp;2.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Packet Loss Measurement</span><span>)</span></a> cannot arise.  The implementation SHOULD assume,
          in evaluating this rate, that the counter size is 32 bits unless
          explicitly configured otherwise, or unless (in the case of a
          bidirectional connection) all local and remote interfaces involved
          in the LM operation are known to be 64-bit-capable, which can be
          inferred from the value of the X flag in an LM response.

Message Loss and Packet Misorder Conditions</h3>

<p>Because an LM operation consists of a message sequence with state
          maintained from one message to the next, LM is subject to the
          effects of lost messages and misordered packets in a way that DM is
          not. Because this state exists only on the querier, the handling of
          these conditions is, strictly speaking, a local matter. This
          section, however, presents RECOMMENDED procedures for handling such
          conditions.
</p>
<p>The first kind of anomaly that may occur is that one or more LM
          messages may be lost in transit. The effect of such loss is that
          when an LM Response is next received at the querier, an unambiguous
          interpretation of the counter values it contains may be impossible,
          for the reasons described at the end of <a class='info' href='#ov_loss'>Section&nbsp;2.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Packet Loss Measurement</span><span>)</span></a>. Whether this is so depends on the number
          of messages lost and the other variables mentioned in that section,
          such as the LM message rate and the connection parameters.
</p>
<p>Another possibility is that LM messages are misordered in
          transit, so that for instance the response to LM[n] is received
          prior to the response to LM[n-1]. A typical implementation will
          discard the late response to LM[n-1], so that the effect is the same
          as the case of a lost message.
</p>
<p>Finally, LM is subject to the possibility that data packets are
          misordered relative to LM messages. This condition can result, for
          example, in a transmit count of 100 and a corresponding receive
          count of 101. The effect here is that the A_TxLoss[n-1,n] value (for
          example) for a given measurement interval will appear to be
          extremely (if not impossibly) large. The other case, where an LM
          message arrives earlier than some of the packets, simply results in
          those packets being counted as lost, which is usually what is
          desired.
</p>

          conditions with sequence numbers and thresholds.]

Timestamp Format Negotiation</h3>

<p>In case either the querier or the responder in a DM transaction
          is capable of supporting multiple timestamp formats, it is desirable
          to determine the optimal format for purposes of delay measurement on
          a particular connection. The procedures for making this
          determination SHALL be as follows.
</p>
<p>Upon sending an initial DM Query over a connection, the querier
          sets the Querier Timestamp Format (QTF) field to its preferred
          timestamp format.
</p>
<p>Upon receiving any DM Query message, the responder determines
          whether it is capable of writing timestamps in the format specified
          by the QTF field. If so, the Responder Timestamp Format (RTF) field
          is set equal to the QTF field. If not, the RTF field is set equal to
          the Responder's Preferred Timestamp Format (RPTF) field.
</p>
<p>The process of changing from one timestamp format to another at
          the responder may result in the Timestamp 1 and Timestamp 4 fields
          in an in-band DM Response having different formats. If this is the
          case, the Control Code in the response MUST NOT be set to 0x1
          (Success). Unless an error condition has occurred, the Control Code
          MUST be set to 0x2 (Notification - Data Format Invalid).
</p>
<p>Upon receiving a DM Response, the querier knows from the RTF
          field in the message whether the responder is capable of supporting
          its preferred timestamp format: if it is, the RTF will be equal to
          the QTF. The querier also knows the responder's preferred timestamp
          format from the RPTF field. The querier can then decide whether to
          retain its current QTF or to change it and repeat the negotiation
          procedures.

Packet Profiles and Quality of Service</h3>

<p>Although this document has referred, for simplicity, to measuring the

Loss Measurement of OAM Messages</h3>

<p>By default the LM packet profile MUST include packets transmitted
          and received over the Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) associated
          with a connection.  An implementation MAY provide the means to alter
          the LM packet profile to exclude some or all G-ACh messages.

<a name="rfc.section.6"></a><h3>6.&nbsp;
Congestion Considerations</h3>

<p>An MPLS-TP network may be traffic-engineered in such a way that the
      bandwidth required both for client traffic and for control, management
      and OAM traffic is always available. The following congestion
      considerations therefore apply only when this is not the case.
</p>
<p>The proactive generation of Loss Measurement and Delay Measurement
      messages for purposes of monitoring the performance of an MPLS-TP
      connection naturally results in a degree of additional load placed on
      both the network and the terminal nodes of the connection. When
      configuring such monitoring, operators should be mindful of the overhead
      involved and should choose transmit rates that do not stress network
      resources unduly; such choices must be informed by the deployment
      context. In case of slower links or lower-speed devices, for example,
      lower Loss Measurement message rates can be chosen, up to the limits
      noted at the end of <a class='info' href='#ov_loss'>Section&nbsp;2.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Packet Loss Measurement</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>In general, lower measurement message rates place less load on the
      network at the expense of reduced granularity. For delay measurement
      this reduced granularity translates to a greater possibility that the
      delay associated with a connection temporarily exceeds the expected
      threshold without detection. For loss measurement, it translates to a
      larger gap in loss information in case of exceptional circumstances such
      as lost LM messages or misordered packets.
</p>
<p>When carrying out a sustained measurement operation such as an LM
      operation or continuous pro-active DM operation, the querier SHOULD take
      note of the number of lost measurement messages (queries for which a
      response is never received) and set a corresponding Measurement Message
      Loss Threshold. If this threshold is exceeded, the measurement operation
      SHOULD be suspended so as not to exacerbate the possible congestion
      condition. This suspension SHOULD be accompanied by an appropriate
      notification to the user so that the condition can be investigated and
      corrected.
</p>
<p>From the receiver perspective, the main consideration is the
      possibility of receiving an excessive quantity of measurement messages.
      An implementation SHOULD employ a mechanism such as rate-limiting to
      guard against the effects of this case. Authentication procedures can
      also be used to ensure that only queries from authorized devices are
      processed.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>There are two main types of security considerations associated with
      the exchange of performance monitoring messages such as those described
      in this document: the possibility of a malicious or misconfigured device
      generating an excessive quantity of messages, causing service
      impairment; and the possibility of an unauthorized device learning the
      data contained in or implied by such messages.
</p>
<p>The first consideration is discussed in <a class='info' href='#con_con'>Section&nbsp;6<span> (</span><span class='info'>Congestion Considerations</span><span>)</span></a>. If reception of performance-related data by
      unauthorized devices is an operational concern, message authentication
      procedures such as those described in [xref] should be used to ensure
      that only queries from authorized devices are processed.
