1.  Introduction

   This document specifies an extension to QUIC version 1
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT] to enable the simultaneous usage of multiple paths
   for a single connection.

   This proposal is based on several basic design points:

   *  Re-use as much as possible mechanisms of QUIC version 1.  In
      particular this proposal uses path validation as specified for
      QUIC version 1 and aims to re-use as much as possible of QUIC's
      connection migration.

   *  Use the same packet header formats as QUIC version 1 to avoid the
      risk of packets being dropped by middleboxes (which may only
      support QUIC version 1)

   *  Congestion Control must be per-path (following [QUIC-TRANSPORT])
      which usually also requires per-path RTT measurements

   *  PMTU discovery should be performed per-path

   *  A path is determined by the 4-tuple of source and destination IP
      address as well as source and destination port.  Therefore there
      can be at most one active paths/connection ID per 4-tuple.

   The path management specified in Section 9 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]
   fulfills multiple goals: it directs a peer to switch sending through
   a new preferred path, and it allows the peer to release resources
   associated with the old path.  Multipath requires several changes to
   that mechanism:

   *  Allow simultaneous transmission of non probing frames on multiple
      paths.

   *  Continue using an existing path even if non-probing frames have
      been received on another path.

Internet-Draft               Multipath QUIC                   March 2022


   *  Manage the removal of paths that have been abandoned.

   As such this extension specifies a departure from the specification
   of path management in Section 9 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT] and therefore
   requires negotiation between the two endpoints using a new transport
   parameter, as specified in Section 3.

   This proposal supports the negotiation of either the use of one
   packet number space for all paths or the use of separate packet
   number spaces per path.  While both approaches are supported by the
   specification in this version of the document, the intention for the
   final publication of a multipath extension for QUIC is to choose one
   option in order to avoid incompatibility.  More evaluation and
   implementation experience is needed to select one approach before
   final publication.  Some discussion about pros and cons can be found
   here: https://github.com/mirjak/draft-lmbdhk-quic-
   multipath/blob/master/presentations/PacketNumberSpace_s.pdf

   As currently defined in this version of the draft the use of multiple
   packet number spaces requires the use of connection IDs is both
   directions.  Today's deployments often only use destination
   connection ID when sending packets from the client to the server as
   this addresses the most important use cases for migration, like NAT
   rebinding or mobility events.  Further discussion and work is
   required to evaluate if the use of multiple packet number spaces
   could be supported as well when the connection ID is only present in
   one direction.

   This proposal does not cover address discovery and management.
   Addresses and the actual decision process to setup or tear down paths
   are assumed to be handled by the application that is using the QUIC
   multipath extension.  Further, this proposal only specifies a simple
   basic packet scheduling algorithm in order to provide some basic
   implementation guidance.  However, more advanced algorithms as well
   as potential extensions to enhance signaling of the current path
   state are expected as future work.

1.1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   We assume that the reader is familiar with the terminology used in
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  In addition, we define the following terms:

Internet-Draft               Multipath QUIC                   March 2022


   *  Path: refers to the 4-tuple {source IP address, source port
      number, destination IP address, destination port number}. A path
      refers to "network path" used in [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

   *  Path Identifier (Path ID): An identifier that is used to identify
      a path in a QUIC connection at an endpoint.  Path Identifier is
      used in multipath control frames (etc.  PATH_ABANDON frame) to
      identify a path.  By default, it is defined as the sequence number
      of the destination Connection ID used for sending packets on that
      particular path, but alternative definitions can be used if the
      length of that connection ID is zero.

   *  Packet Number Space Identifier (PN Space ID): An identifier that
      is used to distinguish packet number spaces for different paths.
      It is used in 1-RTT packets and ACK_MP frames.  Each node
      maintains a list of "Received Packets" for each of the CID that it
      provided to the peer, which is used for acknowledging packets
      received with that CID.

   The difference between Path Identifier and Packet Number Space
   Identifier, is that the Path Identifier is used in multipath control
   frames to identify a path, and the Packet Number Space Identifier is
   used in 1-RTT packets and ACK_MP frames to distinguish packet number
   spaces for different paths.  Both identifiers have the same value,
   which is the sequence number of the connection ID, if a non-zero
   connection ID is used.  If the connection ID is zero length, the
   Packet Number Space Identifier is 0, while the Path Identifier is
   selected on path establishment.

2.  High-level overview

   The multipath extensions to QUIC proposed in this document enable the
   simultaneous utilization of different paths to exchange non-probing
   QUIC frames for a single connection.  This contrasts with the base
   QUIC protocol [QUIC-TRANSPORT] that includes a connection migration
   mechanism that selects only one path to exchange such frames.

   A multipath QUIC connection starts with a QUIC handshake as a regular
   QUIC connection.  See further Section Section 3.  The peers use the
   enable_multipath transport parameter during the handshake to
   negotiate the utilization of the multipath capabilities.  The
   active_connection_id_limit transport parameter limits the maximum
   number of active paths that can be used during a connection.  A
   multipath QUIC connection is thus an established QUIC connection
   where the enable_multipath transport parameter has been successfully
   negotiated.

   To add a new path to an existing multipath QUIC connection, a client
   starts a path validation on the chosen path, as further described in
   Section Section 4.  In this version of the document, a QUIC server
   does not initiate the creation of a path, but it can validate a new
   path created by a client.  A new path can only be used once it has
   been validated.  Each endpoint associates a Path identifier to each
   path.  This identifier is notably used when a peer sends a
   PATH_ABANDON frame to indicate that it has closed the path whose
   identifier is contained in the PATH_ABANDON frame.

   In addition to these core features, an application using Multipath
   QUIC will typically need additional algorithms to handle the number
   of active paths and how they are used to send packets.  As these
   differ depending on the application's requirements, their
   specification is out of scope of this document.

3.  Handshake Negotiation and Transport Parameter

   This extension defines a new transport parameter, used to negotiate
   the use of the multipath extension during the connection handshake,
   as specified in [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  The new transport parameter is
   defined as follow:

   *  name: enable_multipath (TBD - experiments use 0xbabf)

   *  value: 0 (default) for disabled.

   Endpoints use 2-bits in the value field for negotiating one or more
   PN spaces, available option values are listed in Table 1 :

       +========+=================================================+
       | Option | Definition                                      |
       +========+=================================================+
       | 0x0    | don't support multipath                         |
       +--------+-------------------------------------------------+
       | 0x1    | only support one PN space for multipath         |
       +--------+-------------------------------------------------+
       | 0x2    | only support multiple PN spaces for multipath   |
       +--------+-------------------------------------------------+
       | 0x3    | support both one PN space and multiple PN space |
       +--------+-------------------------------------------------+

Internet-Draft               Multipath QUIC                   March 2022


   If for any one of the endpoints the parameter is absent or set to 0,
   or if the two endpoints select incompatible values, one proposing 0x1
   and the other proposing 0x2, the endpoints MUST fallback to
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT] with single path and MUST NOT use any frame or
   mechanism defined in this document.

   If an endpoint proposes the value 0x3, the value proposed by the
   other is accepted.  If both endpoints propose the value 0x3, the
   value 0x2 is negotiated.

   If endpoint receives unexpected value for the transport parameter
   "enable_multipath", it MUST treat this as a connection error of type
   MP_CONNECTION_ERROR and close the connection.

   This extension does not change the definition of any transport
   parameter defined in Section 18.2. of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

   Inline with the definition in [QUIC-TRANSPORT]
   disable_active_migration also disables multipath support, except
   "after a client has acted on a preferred_address transport parameter"
   Section 18.2. of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

   The transport parameter "active_connection_id_limit" [QUIC-TRANSPORT]
   limits the number of usable Connection IDs, and also limits the
   number of concurrent paths.  For the QUIC multipath extension this
   limit even applies when no connection ID is exposed in the QUIC
   header.

4.  Path Setup and Removal

   After completing the handshake, endpoints have agreed to enable
   multipath feature and can start using multiple paths.  This document
   does not specify how an endpoint that is reachable via several
   addresses announces these addresses to the other endpoint.  In
   particular, if the server uses the preferred_address transport
   parameter, clients SHOULD NOT assume that the initial server address
   and the addresses contained in this parameter can be simultaneously
   used for multipath.  Furthermore, this document does not discuss when
   a client decides to initiate a new path.  We delegate such discussion
   in separate documents.

   This proposal adds one multipath control frame for path management:

   *  PATH_ABANDON frame for the receiver side to abandon the path
      Section 12.1

   All the new frames are sent in 1-RTT packets [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

Internet-Draft               Multipath QUIC                   March 2022


4.1.  Path Initiation

   When the multipath option is negotiated, clients that want to use an
   additional path MUST first initiate the Address Validation procedure
   with PATH_CHALLENGE and PATH_RESPONSE frames described in Section 8
   of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  After receiving packets from the client on the
   new paths, the servers MAY in turn attempt to validate these paths
   using the same mechanisms.

   If validation succeed, the client can send non-probing, 1-RTT packets
   on the new paths.  In contrast with the specification in Section 9 of
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT], the server MUST NOT assume that receiving non-
   probing packets on a new path indicates an attempt to migrate to that
   path.  Instead, servers SHOULD consider new paths over which non-
   probing packets have been received as available for transmission.

4.2.  Path Close

   Each endpoint manages the set of paths that are available for
   transmission.  At any time in the connection, each endpoint can
   decide to abandon one of these paths, following for example changes
   in local connectivity or changes in local preferences.  After an
   endpoint abandons a path, the peer will not receive any more non-
   probing packets on that path.

   An endpoint that wants to close a path SHOULD NOT rely on implicit
   signals like idle time or packet losses, but instead SHOULD use
   explicit request to terminate path by sending the PATH_ABANDON frame
   (see Section 12.1).

4.2.1.  Use PATH_ABANDON Frame to Close a Path

   Both endpoints, namely the client and the server, can close a path,
   by sending PATH_ABANDON frame (see Section 12.1) which abandons the
   path with a corresponding Path Identifier.  Once a path is marked as
   "abandoned", it means that the resources related to the path, such as
   the used connection IDs, can be released.  However, information
   related to data delivered over that path SHOULD not be released
   immediately as acknowledgments can still be received or other frames
   that also may trigger retransmission of data on another path.

   The endpoint sending the PATH_ABANDON frame SHOULD consider a path as
   abandoned when the packet that contained the PATH_ABANDON frame is
   acknowledged.  When releasing resources of a path, the endpoint
   SHOULD send a RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame for the connection IDs used
   on the path, if any.

Internet-Draft               Multipath QUIC                   March 2022


   The receiver of a PATH_ABANDON frame SHOULD NOT release its resources
   immediately but SHOULD wait for the receive of the
   RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame for the used connection IDs or 3 RTOs.

   Usually it is expected that the PATH_ABANDON frame is used by the
   client to indicate to the server that path conditions have changed
   such that the path is or will be not usable anymore, e.g. in case of
   an mobility event.  The PATH_ABANDON frame therefore indicates to the
   receiving peer that the sender does not intend to send any packets on
   that path anymore but also recommends to the receiver that no packets
   should be sent in either direction.  The receiver of an PATH_ABANDON
   frame MAY also send an PATH_ABANDON frame to signal its own
   willingness to not send any packet on this path anymore.

   If connection IDs are used, PATH_ABANDON frames can be sent on any
   path, not only the path that is intended to be closed.  Thus a path
   can be abandoned even if connectivity on that path is already broken.
   If no connection IDs are used and the PATH_ABANDON frame has to sent
   on the path that is intended to be closed, it is possible that the
   packet containing the PATH_ABANDON frame or the packet containing the
   ACK for the PATH_ABANDON frame cannot be received anymore and the
   endpoint might need to rely on an idle time out to close the path, as
   described in Section Section 4.2.3.

   Retransmittable frames, that have previously been send on the
   abandoned path and are considered lost, SHOULD be retransmitted on a
   different path.

   If a PATH_ABANDON frame is received for the only active path of a
   QUIC connection, the receiving peer SHOULD send a CONNECTION_CLOSE
   frame and enters the closing state.  If the client received a
   PATH_ABANDON frame for the last open path, it MAY instead try to open
   a new path, if available, and only initiate connection closure if
   path validation fails or a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame is received from
   the server.  Similarly the server MAY wait for a short, limited time
   such as one RTO if a path probing packet is received on a new path
   before sending the CONNECTION_CLOSE frame.

4.2.2.  Effect of RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID Frame

   Receiving a RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame causes the endpoint to discard
   the resources associated with that connection ID.  If the connection
   ID was used by the peer to identify a path from the peer to this
   endpoint, the resources include the list of received packets used to
   send acknowledgements.  The peer MAY decide to keep sending data
   using the same IP addresses and UDP ports previously associated with
   the connection ID, but MUST use a different connection ID when doing
   so.

4.2.3.  Idle Timeout

   [QUIC-TRANSPORT] allows for closing of connections if they stay idle
   for too long.  The connection idle timeout in multipath QUIC is
   defined as "no packet received on any path for the duration of the
   idle timeout".  When only one path is available, servers MUST follow
   the specifications in [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

   When more than one path is available, hosts shall monitor the arrival
   of non-probing packets and the acknowledgements for the packets sent
   over each path.  Hosts SHOULD stop sending traffic on a path if for
   at least max_idle_timeout milliseconds (a) no non-probing packet was
   received or (b) no non-probing packet sent over this path was
   acknowledged, but MAY ignore that rule if it would disqualify all
   available paths.  To avoid idle timeout of a path, endpoints can send
   ack-eliciting packets such as packets containing PING frames
   (Section 19.2 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]) on that path to keep it alive.
   Sending periodic PING frames also helps prevent middlebox timeout, as
   discussed in Section 10.1.2 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

   Server MAY release the resource associated with paths for which no
   non-probing packet was received for a sufficiently long path-idle
   delay, but SHOULD only release resource for the last available path
   if no traffic is received for the duration of the idle timeout, as
   specified in Section 10.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  This means if all
   paths remain idle for the idle timeout, the connection is implicitly
   closed.

   Server implementations need to select the sub-path idle timeout as a
   trade- off between keeping resources, such as connection IDs, in use
   for an excessive time or having to promptly reestablish a path after
   a spurious estimate of path abandonment by the client.

                         Figure 1: States of a path

   In non-final states, hosts have to track the following information.

   *  Associated 4-tuple: The tuple (source IP, source port, destination
      IP, destination port) used by the endhost to send packets over the
      path.

   *  Associated Destination Connection ID: The Connection ID used to
      send packets over the path.

   If multiple packet number spaces are used over the connection, hosts
   MUST also track the following information.

   *  Path Packet Number Space: The endpoint maintains a separate packet
      number for sending and receiving packets over this path.  Packet
      number considerations described in [QUIC-TRANSPORT] apply within
      the given path.

   In the "Active" state, hosts MUST also track the following
   information.



Liu, et al.             Expires 8 September 2022               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft               Multipath QUIC                   March 2022


   *  Associated Source Connection ID: The Connection ID used to receive
      packets over the path.

   A path in the "Validating" state performs path validation as
   described in Section 8.2 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  An endhost should not
   send non-probing frames on a path in "Validating" state, as it has no
   guarantee that packets will actually reach the peer.

   The endhost can use all the paths in the "Active" state, provided
   that the congestion control and flow control currently allow sending
   of new data on a path.

   In the "Closing" state, the endhost SHOULD NOT send packets on this
   path anymore, as there is no guarantee that the peer can still map
   the packets to the connection.  The endhost SHOULD wait for the
   acknowledgment of the PATH_ABANDONED frame before moving the path to
   the "Closed" state to ensure a graceful termination of the path.

   When a path reaches the "Closed" state, the endhost releases all the
   path's associated resources.  Consequently, the endhost is not able
   to send nor receive packets on this path anymore.

5.  Congestion Control

   Senders MUST manage per-path congestion status, and MUST NOT send
   more data on a given path than congestion control on that path
   allows.  This is already a requirement of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

   When a Multipath QUIC connection uses two or more paths, there is no
   guarantee that these paths are fully disjoint.  When two (or more
   paths) share the same bottleneck, using a standard congestion control
   scheme could result in an unfair distribution of the bandwidth with
   the multipath connection getting more bandwidth than competing single
   paths connections.  Multipath TCP uses the LIA congestion control
   scheme specified in [RFC6356] to solve this problem.  This scheme can
   immediately be adapted to Multipath QUIC.  Other coupled congestion
   control schemes have been proposed for Multipath TCP such as [OLIA].

6.  Computing Path RTT

   Acknowledgement delays are the sum of two one-way delays, the delay
   on the packet sending path and the delay on the return path chosen
   for the acknowledgements.  When different paths have different
   characteristics, this can cause acknowledgement delays to vary
   widely.  Consider for example multipath transmission using both a
   terrestrial path, with a latency of 50ms in each direction, and a
   geostationary satellite path, with a latency of 300ms in both
   directions.  The acknowledgement delay will depend on the combination

Internet-Draft               Multipath QUIC                   March 2022


   of paths used for the packet transmission and the ACK transmission,
   as shown in Table 2.

            +======================+=============+===========+
            | ACK Path \ Data path | Terrestrial | Satellite |
            +======================+=============+===========+
            | Terrestrial          | 100ms       | 350ms     |
            +----------------------+-------------+-----------+
            | Satellite            | 350ms       | 600ms     |
            +----------------------+-------------+-----------+

              Table 2: Example of ACK delays using multiple
                                  paths

   Using the default algorithm specified in [QUIC-RECOVERY] would result
   in suboptimal performance, computing average RTT and standard
   deviation from series of different delay measurements of different
   combined paths.  At the same time, early tests showed that it is
   desirable to send ACKs through the shortest path, because a shorter
   ACK delay results in a tighter control loop and better performances.
   The tests also showed that it is desirable to send copies of the ACKs
   on multiple paths, for robustness if a path experiences sudden
   losses.

   An early implementation mitigated the delay variation issue by using
   time stamps, as specified in [QUIC-Timestamp].  When the timestamps
   are present, the implementation can estimate the transmission delay
   on each one-way path, and can then use these one way delays for more
   efficient implementations of recovery and congestion control
   algorithms.

   If timestamps are not available, implementations could estimate one
   way delays using statistical techniques.  For example, in the example
   shown in Table 1, implementations can use use "same path"
   measurements to estimate the one way delay of the terrestrial path to
   about 50ms in each direction, and that of the satellite path to about
   300ms.  Further measurements can then be used to maintain estimates
   of one way delay variations, using logical similar to Kalman filters.
   But statistical processing is error-prone, and using time stamps
   provides more robust measurements.

7.  Packet Scheduling

   The transmission of QUIC packets on a regular QUIC connection is
   regulated by the arrival of data from the application and the
   congestion control scheme.  QUIC packets can only be sent when the
   congestion window of at least one path is open.




Liu, et al.             Expires 8 September 2022               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft               Multipath QUIC                   March 2022


   Multipath QUIC implementations also need to include a packet
   scheduler that decides, among the paths whose congestion window is
   open, the path over which the next QUIC packet will be sent.  Many
   factors can influence the definition of these algorithms and their
   precise definition is outside the scope of this document.  Various
   packet schedulers have been proposed and implemented, notably for
   Multipath TCP.  A companion draft [I-D.bonaventure-iccrg-schedulers]
   provides several general-purpose packet schedulers depending on the
   application goals.

8.  Recovery

   Simultaneous use of multiple paths enables different retransmission
   strategies to cope with losses such as: a) retransmitting lost frames
   over the same path, b) retransmitting lost frames on a different or
   dedicated path, and c) duplicate lost frames on several paths (not
   recommended for general purpose use due to the network overhead).
   While this document does not preclude a specific strategy, more
   detailed specification is out of scope.

9.  Packet Number Space and Use of Connection ID

   If the connection ID is present (non-zero length) in the packet
   header, the connection ID is used to identify the path.  If no
   connection ID is present, the 4 tuple identifies the path.  The
   initial path that is used during the handshake (and multipath
   negotiation) has the path ID 0 and therefore all 0-RTT packets are
   also tracked and processed with the path ID 0.  For 1-RTT packets the
   path ID is the sequence number of the Destination Connection ID
   present in the packet header, as defined in Section 5.1.1 of
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT], or also 0 if the Connection ID is zero-length.

   If non-zero-length Connection IDs are used, an endpoint MUST use
   different Connection IDs on different paths.  Still, the receiver may
   observe the same Connection ID used on different 4-tuples due to,
   e.g., NAT rebinding.  In such case, the receiver reacts as specified
   in Section 9.3 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

   Acknowledgements of Initial and Handshake packets MUST be carried
   using ACK frames, as specified in [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  The ACK frames,
   as defined in [QUIC-TRANSPORT], do not carry path identifiers.  If
   for any reason ACK frames are received in 1-RTT packets while the
   state of multipath negotiation is ambiguous, they MUST be interpreted
   as acknowledging packets sent on path 0.

   Endpoints negotiate the use of one packet number space for all paths
   or separate packet number spaces per path during the connection
   handshake Section 3.  While separate packet number spaces allow for



Liu, et al.             Expires 8 September 2022               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft               Multipath QUIC                   March 2022


   more efficient ACK encoding, especially when paths have highly
   different latencies, this approach requires the use of a connection
   ID.  Therefore use of a single number space can be beneficial when
   endpoints use zero-length connection ID for less overhead.

9.1.  Using One Packet Number Space

   If the multipath option is negotiated to use one packet number space
   for all paths, the packet sequence numbers are allocated from the
   common number space, so that, for example, packet number N could be
   sent on one path and packet number N+1 on another.

   ACK frames report the numbers of packets that have been received so
   far, regardless of the path on which they have been received.  That
   means the senders needs to maintain an association between sent
   packet numbers and the path over which these packets were sent.  This
   is necessary to implement per path congestion control.

   When a packet is acknowledged, the state of the congestion control
   MUST be updated for the path where the acknowledged packet was
   originally sent.  The RTT is calculated based on the delay between
   the transmission of that packet and its first acknowledgement (see
   Section 6) and is used to update the RTT statistics for the sending
   path.

   Also loss detection MUST be adapted to allow for different RTTs on
   different paths.  For example, timer computations should take into
   account the RTT of the path on which a packet was sent.  Detections
   based on packet numbers shall compare a given packet number to the
   highest packet number received for that path.

9.1.1.  Sending Acknowledgements and Handling Ranges

   If senders decide to send packets on paths with different
   transmission delays, some packets will very likely be received out of
   order.  This will cause the ACK frames to carry multiple ranges of
   received packets.  The large number of range increases the size of
   ACK frames, causing transmission and processing overhead.

   The size and overhead of the ACK frames can be controlled by the
   combination of one or several of the following:

   *  Not transmitting again ACK ranges that were present in an ACK
      frame acknowledged by the peer.

   *  Delay acknowledgements to allow for arrival of "hole filling"
      packets.




Liu, et al.             Expires 8 September 2022               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft               Multipath QUIC                   March 2022


   *  Limit the total number of ranges sent in an ACK frame.

   *  Limiting the number of transmissions of a specific ACK range, on
      the assumption that a sufficient number of transmissions almost
      certainly ensures reception by the peer.

   *  Send multiple messages for a given path in a single socket
      operation, so that a series of packets sent from a single path
      uses a series of consecutive sequence numbers without creating
      holes.

9.1.2.  ACK Delay Considerations

   The ACK Delay field of the ACK frame is relative to the largest
   acknowledged packet number (see Section 13.2.5 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]).
   When using paths with different transmission delays, the reported
   host delay will most of the time relate to the path with the shortest
   latency.  To collect ACK delays on all the paths, hosts should rely
   on time stamps as described in [QUIC-Timestamp].

9.2.  Using Multiple Packet Number Spaces

   If the multipath option is enabled with a value of 2, each path has
   its own packet number space for transmitting 1-RTT packets and a new
   ACK frame format is used as specified in Section 12.2.  Compared to
   the QUIC version 1 ACK frame, the ACK_MP frames additionally contains
   a Packet Number Space Identifier (PN Space ID).  The PN Space ID used
   to distinguish packet number spaces for different paths and is simply
   derived from the sequence number of Destination Connection ID.
   Therefore, the packet number space for 1-RTT packets can be
   identified based on the Destination Connection ID in each packets.

   As soon as the negotiation of multipath support with value 2 is
   completed, endpoints SHOULD use ACK_MP frames instead of ACK frames
   for acknowledgements of 1-RTT packets on path 0, as well as for 0-RTT
   packets that are acknowledged after the handshake concluded.

   Following [QUIC-TRANSPORT], each endpoint uses NEW_CONNECTION_ID
   frames to issue usable connections IDs to reach it.  Before an
   endpoint adds a new path by initiating path validation, it MUST check
   whether at least one unused Connection ID is available for each side.

   If the transport parameter "active_connection_id_limit" is negotiated
   as N, the server provided N Connection IDs, and the client is already
   actively using N paths, the limit is reached.  If the client wants to
   start a new path, it has to retire one of the established paths.

Internet-Draft               Multipath QUIC                   March 2022


   ACK_MP frame Section 12.2 can be returned via either a different
   path, or the same path identified by the Path Identifier, based on
   different strategies of sending ACK_MP frames.

   Using multiple packet number spaces requires changes in the way AEAD
   is applied for packet protection, as explained in Section 9.2.1, and
   tighter constraints for key updates, as explained in Section 9.2.2.

9.2.1.  Packet Protection for QUIC Multipath

   Packet protection for QUIC version 1 is specified in Section 5 of
   [QUIC-TLS].  The general principles of packet protection are not
   changed for QUIC Multipath.  No changes are needed for setting packet
   protection keys, initial secrets, header protection, use of 0-RTT
   keys, receiving out-of-order protected packets, receiving protected
   packets, or retry packet integrity.  However, the use of multiple
   number spaces for 1-RTT packets requires changes in AEAD usage.

   Section 5.3 of [QUIC-TLS] specifies AEAD usage, and in particular the
   use of a nonce, N, formed by combining the packet protection IV with
   the packet number.  If multiple packet number spaces are used, the
   packet number alone would not guarantee the uniqueness of the nonce.

   In order to guarantee the uniqueness of the nonce, the nonce N is
   calculated by combining the packet protection IV with the packet
   number and with the path identifier.

   The path ID for 1-RTT packets is the sequence number of of
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT], or zero if the Connection ID is zero-length.
   Section 19 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT] encodes the Connection ID Sequence
   Number as a variable-length integer, allowing values up to 2^62-1; in
   this specification a range of less than 2^32-1 values MUST be used
   before updating the packet protection key.

   To calculate the nonce, a 96 bit path-and-packet-number is composed
   of the 32 bit Connection ID Sequence Number in byte order, two zero
   bits, and the 62 bits of the reconstructed QUIC packet number in
   network byte order.  If the IV is larger than 96 bits, the path-and-
   packet-number is left-padded with zeros to the size of the IV.  The
   exclusive OR of the padded packet number and the IV forms the AEAD
   nonce.

   For example, assuming the IV value is 6b26114b9cba2b63a9e8dd4f, the
   connection ID sequence number is 3, and the packet number is aead,
   the nonce will be set to 6b2611489cba2b63a9e873e2.

9.2.2.  Key Update for QUIC Multipath

   The Key Phase bit update process for QUIC version 1 is specified in
   Section 6 of [QUIC-TLS].  The general principles of key update are
   not changed in this specification.  Following QUIC version 1, the Key
   Phase bit is used to indicate which packet protection keys are used
   to protect the packet.  The Key Phase bit is toggled to signal each
   subsequent key update.  Because of network delays, packets protected
   with the older key might arrive later than the packets protected with
   the new key.  Therefore, the endpoint needs to retain old packet keys
   to allow these delayed packets to be processed and it must
   distinguish between the new key and the old key.  In QUIC version 1,
   this is done using packet numbers so that the rule is made simple:
   Use the older key if packet number is lower than any packet number
   frame the current key phase.

   When using multiple packet number spaces on different paths, some
   care is needed when initiating the Key Update process, as different
   paths use different packet number spaces but share a single key.
   When a key update is initiated on one path, packets sent to another
   path needs to know when the transition is complete.  Otherwise, it is
   possible that the other paths send packets with the old keys, but
   skip sending any packets in the current key phase and directly jump
   to sending packet in the next key phase.  When that happens, as the
   endpoint can only retain two sets of packet protection keys with the
   1-bit Key Phase bit, the other paths cannot distinguish which key
   should be used to decode received packets, which results in a key
   rotation synchronization problem.

   To address such a synchronization issue, if key update is initialized
   on one path, the sender SHOULD send at least one packet with the new
   key on all active paths.  Further, an endpoint MUST NOT initiate a
   subsequent key update until a packet with the current key has been
   acknowledged on each path.

   Following Section 5.4 of [QUIC-TLS], the Key Phase bit is protected,
   so sending multiple packets with Key Phase bit flipping at the same
   time should not cause linkability issue.

                Figure 2: Example of new path establishment

   In Figure Figure 2, the endpoints first exchange new available
   Connection IDs with the NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame.  In this example the
   client provides one Connection ID (C1 with sequence number 1), and
   server provides two Connection IDs (S1 with sequence number 1, and S2
   with sequence number 2).

   Before the client opens a new path by sending an packet on that path
   with a PATH_CHALLENGE frame, it has to check whether there is an
   unused Connection IDs available for each side.  In this example the
   client chooses the Connection ID S2 as the Destination Connection ID
   in the new path.

   If the client has used all the allocated CID, it is supposed to
   retire those that are not used anymore, and the server is supposed to
   provide replacements, as specified in [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  Usually it
   is desired to provide one more connection ID as currently in used, to
   allow for new paths or migration.

10.2.  Path Closure

   In this example the client detects the network environment change
   (client's 4G/Wi-Fi is turned off, Wi-Fi signal is fading to a
   threshold, or the quality of RTT or loss rate is becoming worse) and
   wants to close the initial path.

   Figure 3 illustrates an example of path closing when both the client
   and the server use non-zero-length CIDs.  For the first path, the
   server's 1-RTT packets use DCID C1, which has a sequence number of 1;
   the client's 1-RTT packets use DCID S2, which has a sequence number
   of 2.  For the second path, the server's 1-RTT packets use DCID C2,

   which has a sequence number of 2; the client's 1-RTT packets use DCID
   S3, which has a sequence number of 3.  Note that the paths use
   different packet number spaces.  In this case, the client is going to
   close the first path.  It identifies the path by the sequence number
   of the received packet's DCID over that path (path identifier type
   0x00), hence using the path_id 1.  Optionally, the server confirms
   the path closure by sending an PATH_ABANDON frame using the sequence
   number of the received packet's DCID over that path (path identifier
   type 0x00) as path identifier, which corresponds to the path_id 2.
   Both the client and the server can close the path after receiving the
   RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame for that path.

   Figure 4 illustrates an example of path closing when the client
   chooses to receive zero-length CIDs while the server chooses to
   receive non-zero-length CIDs.  Because there is a zero-length CID in
   one direction, single packet number spaces are used.  For the first
   path, the client's 1-RTT packets use DCID S2, which has a sequence
   number of 2.  For the second path, the client's 1-RTT packets use
   DCID S3, which has a sequence number of 3.  Again, in this case, the
   client is going to close the first path.  Because the client now
   receives zero-length CID packets, it needs to use path identifier
   type 0x01, which identifies a path by the DCID sequence number of the
   packets it sends over that path, and hence, it uses a path_id 2 in
   its PATH_ABANDON frame.  The server SHOULD stop sending new data on
   the path indicated by the PATH_ABANDON frame after receiving it.
   However, The client may want to repeat the PATH_ABANDON frame if it
   sees the server continuing to send data.  When the client's
   PATH_ABANDON frame is acknowledged, it sends out a
   RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame for the CID used on the first path.  The
   server can readily close the first path when it receives the
   RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame from the client.  However, since the
   client will not receive a RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame, after sending
   out the RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame, the client waits for 3 RTO before
   closing the path.

     Client                                                      Server

     (client tells server to abandon a path)
     1-RTT[X]: DCID=S2 PATH_ABANDON[path_id_type=1, path_id=2]->
                                (server stops sending on that path after
                                                 receiving PATH_ABANDON)
     (client retires the corresponding CID
         after PATH_ABANDON is acknowledged)
     1-RTT[X+1]: DCID=S3 RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID[2]->

       Figure 4: Example of closing a path when the client chooses to
       receive zero- length CIDs while the server chooses to receive
                            non-zero-length CIDs

11.  Implementation Considerations

11.1.  Handling different PMTU sizes

   An implementation should take care to handle different PMTU sizes
   across multiple paths.  One simple option if the PMTUs are relatively
   similar is to apply the minimum PMTU of all paths to each path.  The
   benefit of such an approach is to simplify retransmission processing
   as the content of lost packets initially sent on one path can be sent
   on another path without further frame scheduling adaptations.

12.  New Frames

   All the new frames MUST only be sent in 1-RTT packet, and MUST NOT
   use other encryption levels.

   If an endpoint receives multipath-specific frames from packets of
   other encryption levels, it MUST return MP_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION as a
   connection error and close the connection.

12.1.  PATH_ABANDON Frame

   The PATH_ABANDON frame informs the peer to abandon a path.  More
   complex path management can be made possible with additional
   extensions (e.g., PATH_STATUS frame in [I-D.liu-multipath-quic] ).

   PATH_ABANDON frames are formatted as shown in Figure 5.

     PATH_ABANDON Frame {
       Type (i) = TBD-03 (experiments use 0xbaba05),
       Path Identifier (..),
       Error Code (i),
       Reason Phrase Length (i),
       Reason Phrase (..),
     }

                    Figure 5: PATH_ABANDON Frame Format

   PATH_ABANDON frames contain the following fields:

   Path Identifier: An identifier of the path, which is formatted as
   shown in Figure 6.

   *  Identifier Type: Identifier Type field is set to indicate the type
      of path identifier.

      -  Type 0: Refer to the connection identifier issued by the sender
         of the control frame.  Note that this is the connection
         identifier used by the peer when sending packets on the to-be-
         closed path.  This method SHOULD be used if this connection
         identifier is non-zero length.  This method MUST NOT be used if
         this connection identifier is zero-length.

      -  Type 1: Refer to the connection identifier issued by the
         receiver of the control frame.  Note that this is the
         connection identifier used by the sender when sending packets
         on the to-be-closed path.  This method MUST NOT be used if this
         connection identifier is zero-length.

Internet-Draft               Multipath QUIC                   March 2022


      -  Type 2: Refer to the path over which the control frame is sent
         or received.

   *  Path Identifier Content: A variable-length integer specifying the
      path identifier.  If Identifier Type is 2, the Path Identifier
      Content MUST be empty.

     Path Identifier {
       Identifier Type (i) = 0x00..0x02,
       [Path Identifier Content (i)],
     }

                      Figure 6: Path Identifier Format

   Note: If the receiver of the PATH_ABANDON frame is using non-zero
   length Connection ID on that path, endpoint SHOULD use type 0x00 for
   path identifier in the control frame.  If the receiver of the
   PATH_ABANDON frame is using zero-length Connection ID, but the peer
   is using non-zero length Connection ID on that path, endpoints SHOULD
   use type 0x01 for path identifier.  If both endpoints are using
   0-length Connection IDs on that path, endpoints SHOULD only use type
   0x02 for path identifier.

   Error Code:  A variable-length integer that indicates the reason for
      abandoning this path.

   Reason Phrase Length:  A variable-length integer specifying the
      length of the reason phrase in bytes.  Because an PATH_ABANDON
      frame cannot be split between packets, any limits on packet size
      will also limit the space available for a reason phrase.

   Reason Phrase:  Additional diagnostic information for the closure.
      This can be zero length if the sender chooses not to give details
      beyond the Error Code value.  This SHOULD be a UTF-8 encoded
      string [RFC3629], though the frame does not carry information,
      such as language tags, that would aid comprehension by any entity
      other than the one that created the text.

   PATH_ABANDON frames SHOULD be acknowledged.  If a packet containing a
   PATH_ABANDON frame is considered lost, the peer SHOULD repeat it.

   If the Identifier Type is 0x00 or 0x01, PATH_ABANDON frames MAY be
   sent on any path, not only the path identified by the Path Identifier
   Content field.  If the Identifier Type if 0x02, the PATH_ABANDON
   frame MUST only be sent on the path that is intended to be abandoned.

12.2.  ACK_MP Frame

   The ACK_MP frame (types TBD-00 and TBD-01; experiments use
   0xbaba00..0xbaba01) is an extension of the ACK frame defined by
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  It is used to acknowledge packets that were sent
   on different paths when using multiple packet number spaces.  If the
   frame type is TBD-01, ACK_MP frames also contain the sum of QUIC
   packets with associated ECN marks received on the connection up to
   this point.

   ACK_MP frame is formatted as shown in Figure 7.

     ACK_MP Frame {
       Type (i) = TBD-00..TBD-01 (experiments use 0xbaba00..0xbaba01),
       Packet Number Space Identifier (i),
       Largest Acknowledged (i),
       ACK Delay (i),
       ACK Range Count (i),
       First ACK Range (i),
       ACK Range (..) ...,
       [ECN Counts (..)],
     }

                       Figure 7: ACK_MP Frame Format

   Compared to the ACK frame specified in [QUIC-TRANSPORT], the
   following field is added.

   Packet Number Space Identifier: An identifier of the path packet
   number space, which is the sequence number of Destination Connection
   ID of the 1-RTT packets which are acknowledged by the ACK_MP frame.
   If the endpoint receives 1-RTT packets with zero-length Connection
   ID, it SHOULD use Packet Number Space Identifier 0 in ACK_MP frames.
   If an endpoint receives a ACK_MP frame with a non-existing packet
   number space ID, it MUST treat this as a connection error of type
   MP_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION and close the connection.

   When using a single packet number space, endhosts MUST NOT send
   ACK_MP frames.  If an endhost receives an ACK_MP frame while a single
   packet number space was negotiated, it MUST treat this as a
   connection error of type MP_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION and close the
   connection.

13.  Error Codes

   Multipath QUIC transport error codes are 62-bit unsigned integers
   following [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

Internet-Draft               Multipath QUIC                   March 2022


   This section lists the defined multipath QUIC transport error codes
   that can be used in a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame with a type of 0x1c.
   These errors apply to the entire connection.

   MP_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION (experiments use 0xba01): An endpoint detected
   an error with protocol compliance that was not covered by more
   specific error codes.

14.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new transport parameter for the negotiation
   of enable multiple paths for QUIC, and two new frame types.  The
   draft defines provisional values for experiments, but we expect IANA
   to allocate short values if the draft is approved.

   The following entry in Table 3 should be added to the "QUIC Transport
   Parameters" registry under the "QUIC Protocol" heading.
