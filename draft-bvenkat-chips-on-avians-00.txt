Abstract

   This memo describes an experimental method for the funneling IP 
   datagrams using tweets and chirps, through avian carriers
   which are embedded with a processor/chip that is bio-medically
   engineered for a fit in their tiny brains.  This specification is 
   primarily useful in Metropolitan Area Networks.  This is an 
   experimental, not recommended method.

1.0 Overview and Rational

   Bio-medically engineered chips provide low delay, high throughput
   and low altitude service when fitted into avians. Mobility is the
   key word in this respect. Avians fitted with such chips can fly
   anywhere in a given metropolitan area. It is assumed that such an
   area is equipped with what one might call low altitude IP towers
   that look around for avians flying in their area.

   The connection topology can be non point-to-point for each carrier
   and as specified in RFC 1149 [1] can be used without significant
   interference with one another, outside of early spring. The carriers
   as specified have an intrinsic collision avoidance system which is
   supplemented by a method that is described in this document.
   The bio-medically engineered chip allows low frequency signals
   to be transmitted by these specially equipped avians that helps
   signals move around large objects such as skyscrapers and reach
   another such avian with whom negotiation has taken place prior
   to such a signal, or a low altitude IP tower in the area with whom
   negotiation has been arranged. In addition the chip also allows 
   for high frequency signals to be transmitted that are inaudible
   to the human ear.

   IP traffic funnelled through after such negotiation can be 
   connection oriented as in TCP or unreliable transport as in UDP.   

   The issues to be discussed include addressing for each such 
   avian prior to the negotiation, after the negotiation and for
   each low altitude IP tower, the last of which provides for easy
   address allocation through static means from a central controlling
   authority. The layer 2 address for a avian ridden with a chip
   or more is unique for each such avian chip. Similarly the IP  
   tower has a unique layer 2 address that fits in the piece of the
   puzzle.

   The low delay is achieved by the high data content in the fast
   moving tweets and chirps, the variations of which are unheard of
   in the human hearable frequencies. Thus these tweets and chirps
   may be unheard by the normal human ear except for the upper range
   of lower frequency chirps that provide for high delay and low
   throughput for traffic of the kind that requires delivery but not
   instant delivery.   

1.1  Requirements language

   In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST, "MUST NOT", "optional",

   "recommended", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT", are to be interpreted as
   described in [2].

2.0 Addressing
    
   The layer 2 addressing is done by allocating a MAC address to
   every chip that is set on board an avian's brain. Appropriate
   surgical techniques may be used to implant the chip with 
   connections to its auditory and vocal mechanisms. The chip is
   tuned to transmit in a particular frequency. If two chips are
   of the same frequency then two avians implanted with the same
   frequency, may collide in their transmissions if they are in
   the same Avian arena. For this reason the avians are tagged to be
   released in areas exclusive of the other's if they happen to
   have the same send/receive frequency. It is the intention of
   this draft to treat each avian as a mobile router of packets
   that may be sent on the native frequency of the chip on that
   avian. Such collisions would require drastic action such as 
   shooting down the colliding avian that has contravened its 
   avian arena boundaries. 

   The IP towers are equipped with sufficient instrumentation to
   pick up the varying frequencies of the various avian chips
   that are implanted. Each is considered a physical channel all
   by itself. IP datagrams may be funnelled on each such physical
   channel. Thus each such physical channel would carry data from
   one IP tower to another via these avians or from one IP tower
   to another avian and then onto another avian operating in a
   different Avian Arena (AA) that is adjacent to that of the first
   avian. Thus a sequence of Avian Arenas adjacent to each
   other would be serviced by one avian each per frequency. 
   Transmission and reciept from one Avian Arena avian to another 
   would be negotiated as well. A draft for recommending the 
   guidelines for such negotiation can be taken up for further enquiry.

   It is an intrinsic advantage of this design that the MAC 
   address (the prefix at least) can be learnt from the 
   frequency of the avian chip. The OUI portion of the MAC
   address can be shorter than the standard 24 bits. Thus 
   a larger number of Avian Arenas can be arranged adjacent
   to each other thus providing for more coverage. However it
   is recommended that IP towers be placed in a manner that 
   have not more than 3 or 4 AA's sequenced or adjacent to 
   each other.

   Thus a collision domain is within an avian arena. Outside
   of the avian arena the frequencies may be weak and an old
   avian for that matter would serve as a weak link in the
   transmission.

   Appropriate guard bands are provided for a given "chirps
   and tweets" on a particular frequency so that collision of
   Z frequency type avian chip with Y frequency type avian
   chip is avoided.

3.0 Mobile ROUTING 

   Avian arena changes can be negotiated through the mobility
   of an avian into another avian's arena. Thus two avians on
   the same frequency may arrange to swap one another or 
   arrange to rearrange the distribution of same frequency 
   avians through a protocol. This subject too is left for 
   further enquiry.

   Standard routing protocols are run on avians with more than
   one chip. Each chip represents an interface. Each such chip
   would in turn transmit in a different frequency than from 
   the other. This way traffic could be switched across multiple
   frequencies and carried to its end destination. Thus at any
   given time, an avian may be receiving on one frequency and
   transmitting on another interface at a different frequency.
   The IP towers or adjacent avian arena avians may capture that
   data and forward them further along the way. Route 
   distribution through the standard protocols are thus sent on
   multiple frequencies through various avians in differing 
   avian arenas. 

   A single chipped avian serves as a repeater.

4.0 Data 

   A tweet represents a one. A chirp represents a zero. The 
   chips implanted on these avians SHALL help the avian thereof
   to chirp and tweet very rapidly. The physical standards 
   are determined by the chip manufacturer. 

5.0 Chirpy Chirpy Chip Chip

   The chip implanted in such avians have a persistence 
   capability as well with on board memory that can be retained
   while an avian flies across several avian arenas and into
   another avian domain. An Avian Domain consists of several
   avian arenas. It is the equivalent of an autonomous system.
   This persistent data can be exchanged in another domain where
   such data may be found useful. Uses for such trans-avian
   domain data can be found as in exchange of such data to the
   border avian routers of a given avian domain. Thus the
   topology of the interns of a given avian domain or a part
   of it can be transported to the border avian routers of 
   another domain.

6.0 Frame Format

   The IP datagram is not printed on a small scroll of paper as
   specified in RFC 1149 [1]. It is available in the form of chirps
   and tweets in a combination of varying pitch/frequency. It is
   only known or recognizable to the chip-ridden avian, in reality
   to the chip alone rather than to the avian itself. So security

   is not a problem as the signals are not traceable except with
   the help of a very powerful mega-microphone. If availability of
   such mega-microphones is found to be a problem, the data can
   be encrypted using standard encryption techniques such as IPsec.

   No scrolls of paper are tied around the avian carrier thus saving
   a lot of payload. One might assume that it is offset by the 
   embedding of a chip into the tiny brain of the avian but then
   again the ratio of the chip to paper is found to be well tilted
   in favour of the former. 

   No duct tape need be used in this case. MTUs are found to be of
   a larger size in case of the chip-ridden avian as the CRC that 
   ties in a frame is of a larger size than conventional protocols.
   Carrier age is a problem though the chip does not degrade
   with the age of the avian but the soft tissue connecting 
   the chip to its auditory and speech system may weaken as time 
   passes by. So retransmissions on an older avian may be found 
   to be occurring very rabidly. With regard to the degradation of
   its chirp and tweet beak and vocal cords, transmission of frames
   may be found to be degrading thus leading the avian to be put to
   its terminal end of service by removing the chip from its brain. 
   Such an operation may free the avian from further traffic forwarding 
   but may cause loss of auditory and speech functionalities. It MAY
   return to the normal hearable chirps and tweets which would be
   audible to the human ear.

   The layer 2 frame header for a set of data is similar to IEEE 802.3
   with 802.2 LLC. Since the chirps and tweets are audible to a
   receiver in that range, they are picked up by the reciever (in
   a different avian arena) when the said receiver is not 
   transmitting. If a collision occurs then both avian carriers back 
   off as per the CSMA/CD mechanism outlined in IEEE 802.3 standards. 

7.0 Interoperation with existing network devices

   Appropriate devices are available for interoperation with such
   avian carriers that possess an avian chip. Chip manufacturers 
   provide appropriate interfaces to tap into a dead avian or a live
   one to transfer data back and forth from an avian chip to the
   said device which may be a router, that is tangibly visible as one
   to humans.

8.0 Loss of a carrier in an arena.

   The loss of a carrier in an arena can result in the stoppage of
   traffic in that arena onto the adjacent one. This is taken care by
   providing a backup avian carrier since avians usually travel in
   pairs. Once a backup avian comes active in an avian arena 
   another couple is released in that avian arena with the same
   chip configuration but with the chirping and tweeting disabled.
   Thus fault tolerance is achieved on that count.

9.0 Security Considerations

   As discussed earlier security is not a problem except in the
   cross avian arena border transition case, which might take place
   if an avian finds a courtship to be undertaken with another
   avian in a different avian domain. This is sought to be 
   restricted by injecting suitable mitigating agents that 
   suppress the enzymes responsible for such courtship in a given
   avian carrier.
