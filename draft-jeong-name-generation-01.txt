               1. Introduction 
                   
                  This document describes a simple mechanism which generates a unique 
                  domain name for a node in home-network or ad-hoc network where      
                  there is no network manager. This mechanism is useful when a node 
                  would like to configure a unique domain name per network interface of 
                  a node automatically in the environment where there is no dedicated 
                  DNS name server and network manager, such as the unmanaged home-
                  network and ad-hoc network. 
                   
               2. Mechanism of Unique DNS Name Generation 
                   
                  The mechanism for DNS name generation makes a unique domain name with 
                  user-id, device-id (network device's address extended into EUI-64) 
                  and domain like Figure 1 [3]. 
                   
                     ---------------------------------------------- 
                     |   user-id   |   device-id   |    domain    | 
                     ---------------------------------------------- 
                   
                    Figure 1. Format of DNS name 
                   
                  "user-id" is the user identifier selected by user and "device-id" is      
                  EUI-64 identifier derived from the network device's built-in 48-bit      
                  IEEE 802 address [3]. "domain" indicates the domain where a node is 
                  placed and SHOULD include "EUI-64" sub-domain which indicates that 
                  the domain name is based on EUI-64. The domain for ad-hoc network is 
                  defined as "EUI-64.ADHOC." and that for home-network as "EUI-
                  64.HOMENET.". 
                   
                  For example, when user-id is "PAUL", device-id is "36-56-78-FF-FE-     
                  9A-BC-DE", and domain is "EUI-64.ADHOC.", a unique domain name would      
                  be "PAUL.36-56-78-FF-FE-9A-BC-DE.EUI-64.ADHOC." [4]. The advantage of 
                  the above mechanism guarantees that no name conflict happens although 
                  users in other nodes use the same user-id. For example, like Figure 2, 
                  there are node A, B and C in the same subnet and they all use the 
                  same user-id, "PAUL". The domain where they are placed is "EUI-
                  64.ADHOC.". The domain name of each node is made like Table 1. The 
                  domain name "NAME1" is for node A, the domain name "NAME2" is for 
                  node B. When node C generates its domain name on the basis of its

                  user-id "PAUL" and device-id derived "EUI64-3" from its network 
                  device address "MAC3". Though node C uses the same user-id as node A 
                  and B, it can configure a unique domain name owing to the difference 
                  of network device address without the procedure of verifying the 
                  uniqueness of domain name [5].

                  Table 1 shows how nodes with the same user-id can configure a

                    Table 1. Configuration of DNS names of the nodes in Figure 2 
                   
                  Thus, nodes can configure their unique domain name regardless of 
                  their user-id. 
                   
               3. DNS Name Generation in IPv6 
                   
                  In most systems, because the manual configuration of network device 
                  address, i.e., MAC address, is allowed, the duplicate MAC address can 
                  exist in the network. In this case, the DNS names based on network 
                  device identifier can be duplicate in the network. Therefore, the 
                  verification of the uniqueness of generated DNS name is necessary.

                  In IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration, the low-order 64-bit 
                  interface identifier derived from network device identifier is 
                  verified through duplicate address detection (DAD) [6]. Therefore, 
                  IPv6 node generates a unique domain name per network interface by 
                  using the verified low-order 64 bits of the IPv6 unicast address that 
                  has been already configured in the network interface. 
                   
               4. DNS Name Generation in IPv4 
                   
                  A unique IPv4 address can be autoconfigured through the dynamic 
                  configuration of IPv4 link-local address through in the zeroconf 
                  environment [7]. On an IPv4 address being configured in network 
                  interface, the uniqueness of the address is verified through 
                  duplicate detection mechanism. With this unique address, a unique DNS 
                  name can be generated. The 64-bit EUI-64 identifier for "device-id" 
                  of the unique DNS name is derived from an EUI-64 format having the 
                  embedded IPv4 address like ISATAP [8]. 
                   
               5. Implementation Considerations 
                   
                  user-id and domain are registered as options statement of the 
                  configuration file for DNS name server as follows; 
                   
                       options { 
                        
                           user-id "PAUL"; 
                           domain "EUI-64.ADHOC."; 
                            
                       }; 
                   
                  The DNS name automatically generated with the above information can 
                  be used in order to make DNS resource records for DNS service with 
                  the IP address (IPv4 or IPv6 address) which is associated with 
                  network interface. 
                   
               6. Security Considerations 
                   
                  As network device identifier (or MAC address) is exposed in DNS name, 
                  there would be security attack. To prevent the attack, we SHOULD use 
                  hash function that can hide the network device identifier. The binary 
                  string of the EUI-64 identifier for "device-id" is hashed through 
                  hash function, such as MD5 and HMAC [9][10].
