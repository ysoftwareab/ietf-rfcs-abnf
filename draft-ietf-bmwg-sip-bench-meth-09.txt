Methodology for Benchmarking Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)  Devices:
                  Basic session setup and registration
                   draft-ietf-bmwg-sip-bench-meth-09

Abstract

   This document provides a methodology for benchmarking the Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) performance of devices.  Terminology
   related to benchmarking SIP devices is described in the companion
   terminology document.  Using these two documents, benchmarks can be
   obtained and compared for different types of devices such as SIP
   Proxy Servers, Registrars and Session Border Controllers.  The term
   "performance" in this context means the capacity of the device-under-
   test (DUT) to process SIP messages.  Media streams are used only to
   study how they impact the signaling behavior.  The intent of the two
   documents is to provide a normalized set of tests that will enable an
   objective comparison of the capacity of SIP devices.  Test setup
   parameters and a methodology is necessary because SIP allows a wide
   range of configuration and operational conditions that can influence
   performance benchmark measurements.  A standard terminology and
   methodology will ensure that benchmarks have consistent definition
   and were obtained following the same procedures.

Internet-Draft        SIP Benchmarking Methodology         February 2014


1.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, conforming to [RFC2119] and indicate requirement
   levels for compliant implementations.

   RFC 2119 defines the use of these key words to help make the intent
   of standards track documents as clear as possible.  While this
   document uses these keywords, this document is not a standards track
   document.  The term Throughput is defined in [RFC2544].

   Terms specific to SIP [RFC3261] performance benchmarking are defined
   in [I-D.sip-bench-term].


2.  Introduction

   This document describes the methodology for benchmarking Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) performance as described in Terminology
   document [I-D.sip-bench-term].  The methodology and terminology are
   to be used for benchmarking signaling plane performance with varying
   signaling and media load.  Media streams, when used, are used only to
   study how they impact the signaling behavior.  This document
   concentrates on benchmarking SIP session setup and SIP registrations
   only.

   The device-under-test (DUT) is a SIP server, which may be any SIP
   conforming [RFC3261] device.  Benchmarks can be obtained and compared
   for different types of devices such as SIP Proxy Server, Session
   Border Controllers (SBC), SIP registrars and SIP proxy server paired
   with a media relay.

   The test cases provide metrics for benchmarking the maximum 'SIP
   Registration Rate' and maximum 'SIP Session Establishment Rate' that
   the DUT can sustain over an extended period of time without failures.
   Some cases are included to cover Encrypted SIP.  The test topologies
   that can be used are described in the Test Setup section.  Topologies
   in which the DUT handles media as well as those in which the DUT does
   not handle media are both considered.  The measurement of the
   performance characteristics of the media itself is outside the scope
   of these documents.

   SIP permits a wide range of configuration options that are explained
   in Section 4 and Section 2 of [I-D.sip-bench-term].  Benchmark values
   could possibly be impacted by Associated Media.  The selected values
   for Session Duration and Media Streams per Session enable benchmark

   metrics to be evaluated without Associated Media.  Session
   Establishment Rate could possibly be impacted by the selected value
   for Maximum Sessions Attempted.  The benchmark for Session
   Establishment Rate is measured with a fixed value for maximum Session
   Attempts.

   SIP permits a wide range of configuration options that are explained
   in Section 4 and Section 2 of [I-D.sip-bench-term].  Benchmark
   metrics could possibly be impacted by Associated Media.  The selected
   values for Session Duration and Media Streams per Session enable
   benchmark metrics to be benchmarked without Associated Media.
   Session Setup Rate could possibly be impacted by the selected value
   for Maximum Sessions Attempted.  The benchmark for Session
   Establishment Rate is measured with a fixed value for maximum Session
   Attempts.

   Finally, the overall value of these tests is to serve as a comparison
   function between multiple SIP implementations.  One way to use these
   tests is to derive benchmarks with SIP devices from Vendor-A, derive
   a new set of benchmarks with similar SIP devices from Vendor-B and
   perform a comparison on the results of Vendor-A and Vendor-B.  This
   document does not make any claims on the interpretation of such
   results.


3.  Benchmarking Topologies

   There are two test topologies; one in which the DUT does not process
   the media (Figure 1) and the other in which it does process media
   (Figure 2).  In both cases, the tester or EA sends traffic into the
   DUT and absorbs traffic from the DUT.  The diagrams in Figure 1 and
   Figure 2 represent the logical flow of information and do not dictate
   a particular physical arrangements of the entities.

   Test organizations need to be aware that these tests generate large
   volumes of data and consequently ensure that networking devices like
   hubs, switches or routers are able to handle the generated volume.

   Figure 1 depicts a layout in which the DUT as an intermediary between
   the two interfaces of the EA.  If the test case requires the exchange
   of media, the media does not flow through the DUT but rather passes
   directly between the two endpoints.  Figure 2 shows the DUT as an
   intermediary between the two interfaces of the EA.  If the test case
   requires the exchange of media, the media flows through the DUT
   between the endpoints.

4.  Test Setup Parameters

4.1.  Selection of SIP Transport Protocol

   Test cases may be performed with any transport protocol supported by
   SIP.  This includes, but is not limited to, TCP, UDP, TLS and
   websockets.  The protocol used for the SIP transport protocol must be
   reported with benchmarking results.

4.2.  Signaling Server

   The Signaling Server is defined in the companion terminology
   document, ([I-D.sip-bench-term], Section 3.2.2).  The Signaling
   Server is a DUT.

Internet-Draft        SIP Benchmarking Methodology         February 2014


4.3.  Associated Media

   Some tests require Associated Media to be present for each SIP
   session.  The test topologies to be used when benchmarking DUT
   performance for Associated Media are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2.

4.4.  Selection of Associated Media Protocol

   The test cases specified in this document provide SIP performance
   independent of the protocol used for the media stream.  Any media
   protocol supported by SIP may be used.  This includes, but is not
   limited to, RTP, RTSP, and SRTP.  The protocol used for Associated
   Media MUST be reported with benchmarking results.

4.5.  Number of Associated Media Streams per SIP Session

   Benchmarking results may vary with the number of media streams per
   SIP session.  When benchmarking a DUT for voice, a single media
   stream is used.  When benchmarking a DUT for voice and video, two
   media streams are used.  The number of Associated Media Streams MUST
   be reported with benchmarking results.

4.6.  Session Duration

   The value of the DUT's performance benchmarks may vary with the
   duration of SIP sessions.  Session Duration MUST be reported with
   benchmarking results.  A Session Duration of zero seconds indicates
   transmission of a BYE immediately following successful SIP
   establishment indicate by receipt of a 200 OK.  An infinite Session
   Duration indicates that a BYE is never transmitted.

4.7.  Attempted Sessions per Second

   The value of the DUT's performance benchmarks may vary with the
   Session Attempt Rate offered by the tester.  Session Attempt Rate
   MUST be reported with the benchmarking results.

4.8.  Benchmarking algorithm

   In order to benchmark the test cases uniformly in Section 6, the
   algorithm described in this section should be used.  Both, a prosaic
   description of the algorithm and a pseudo-code description are
   provided.

   The goal is to find the largest value, R, of a SIP Session Attempt
   Rate, measured in sessions-per-second, which the DUT can process with
   zero errors over a defined, extended period.  This period is defined
   as the amount of time needed to attempt N SIP sessions, where N is a

Internet-Draft        SIP Benchmarking Methodology         February 2014


   parameter of test, at the attempt rate, R. An iterative process is
   used to find this rate.  The iterative process is divided into two
   distinct phases: Candidate Identification and Steady State Testing.

   During the Candidate Identification phase, the test runs until n
   sessions have been attempted, at session attempt rates, r, which vary
   according to the algorithm below, where n is also a parameter of test
   and is a relatively large number, but an order of magnitude smaller
   than N. If no errors occur during the time it takes to attempt n
   sessions, we increment r according to the algorithm.  If errors are
   encountered during the test, we decrement r according to the
   algorithm.  The algorithm provides a variable, G, that allows us to
   control how the accuracy, in sessions per second, that we require of
   the test.

   After this candidate rate has been discovered, the test enters the
   Steady State phase.  In the Steady State phase, N session Attempts
   are made at the candidate rate.  The goal is to find a rate at which
   the DUT can process calls "forever" with no errors and the test
   organization can choose N as large as it deems appropriate.  If
   errors are encountered during this steady-state phase, the candidate
   rate is reduced by a defined percent, also a parameter of test, and
   the steady-state phase is entered again until a final (new) steady-
   state rate is achieved.

   The iterative process itself is defined as follows: A starting rate
   of r = 100 sessions per second is used and we place calls at that
   rate until n = 5000 calls have been placed.  If all n calls are
   successful, the rate is increased to 150 sps and again we place calls
   at that rate until n = 5000 calls have been placed.  The attempt rate
   is continuously ramped up until a failure is encountered before n =
   5000 calls have been placed.  Then an attempt rate is calculated that
   is higher than the last successful attempt rate by a quantity equal
   to half the difference between the rate at which failures occurred
   and the last successful rate.  If this new attempt rate also results
   in errors, a new attempt rate is tried that is higher than the last
   successful attempt rate by a quantity equal to half the difference
   between the rate at which failures occurred and the last successful
   rate.  Continuing in this way, an attempt rate without errors is
   found.  The tester can specify margin of error using the parameter G,
   measured in units of sessions per second.

   The pseudo-code corresponding to the description above follows.

      To benchmark the Session Establishment Rate of the Emulated Agent
      (EA) with zero failures.

   Procedure:
      1.  Configure the DUT in the test topology shown in Figure 1.
      2.  Set media streams per session to 0.
      3.  Execute benchmarking algorithm as defined in Section 4.8 to
          get the baseline session establishment rate.  This rate MUST
          be recorded using any pertinent parameters as shown in the
          reporting format of Section 5.1.

   Expected Results:  This is the scenario to obtain the maximum Session
      Establishment Rate of the EA and the test bed when no DUT is
      present.  The results of this test might be used to normalize test
      results performed on different test beds or simply to better
      understand the impact of the DUT on the test bed in question.

6.2.  Session Establishment Rate without media

   Objective:
      To benchmark the Session Establishment Rate of the DUT with no
      associated media and zero failures.

   Procedure:
      1.  Configure a DUT according to the test topology shown in
          Figure 1 or Figure 2.
      2.  Set media streams per session to 0.
      3.  Execute benchmarking algorithm as defined in Section 4.8 to
          get the session establishment rate.  This rate MUST be
          recorded using any pertinent parameters as shown in the
          reporting format of Section 5.1.

   Expected Results:  Find the Session Establishment Rate of the DUT
      when the EA is not sending media streams.

6.3.  Session Establishment Rate with Media not on DUT

   Objective:
      To benchmark the Session Establishment Rate of the DUT with zero
      failures when Associated Media is included in the benchmark test
      but the media is not running through the DUT.

   Procedure:
      1.  Configure a DUT according to the test topology shown in
          Figure 1.
      2.  Set media streams per session to 1.
      3.  Execute benchmarking algorithm as defined in Section 4.8 to
          get the session establishment rate with media.  This rate MUST
          be recorded using any pertinent parameters as shown in the
          reporting format of Section 5.1.

   Expected Results:  Session Establishment Rate results obtained with
      Associated Media with any number of media streams per SIP session
      are expected to be identical to the Session Establishment Rate
      results obtained without media in the case where the DUT is
      running on a platform separate from the platform on which the
      Media Relay.

6.4.  Session Establishment Rate with Media on DUT

   Objective:
      To benchmark the Session Establishment Rate of the DUT with zero
      failures when Associated Media is included in the benchmark test
      and the media is running through the DUT.

   Procedure:
      1.  Configure a DUT according to the test topology shown in
          Figure 2.
      2.  Set media streams per session to 1.
      3.  Execute benchmarking algorithm as defined in Section 4.8 to
          get the session establishment rate with media.  This rate MUST
          be recorded using any pertinent parameters as shown in the
          reporting format of Section 5.1.

   Expected Results:  Session Establishment Rate results obtained with
      Associated Media may be lower than those obtained without media in
      the case where the DUT and the Media Relay are running on the same
      platform.

6.5.  Session Establishment Rate with TLS Encrypted SIP

   Objective:
      To benchmark the Session Establishment Rate of the DUT with zero
      failures when using TLS encrypted SIP signaling.

Internet-Draft        SIP Benchmarking Methodology         February 2014


   Procedure:
      1.  If the DUT is being benchmarked as a proxy or B2BUA, then
          configure the DUT in the test topology shown in Figure 1 or
          Figure 2.
      2.  Configure the tester to enable TLS over the transport being
          used during benchmarking.  Note the ciphersuite being used for
          TLS and record it in Section 5.1.
      3.  Set media streams per session to 0 (media is not used in this
          test).
      4.  Execute benchmarking algorithm as defined in Section 4.8 to
          get the session establishment rate with TLS encryption.

   Expected Results:  Session Establishment Rate results obtained with
      TLS Encrypted SIP may be lower than those obtained with plaintext
      SIP.

6.6.  Session Establishment Rate with IPsec Encrypted SIP

   Objective:
      To benchmark the Session Establishment Rate of the DUT with zero
      failures when using IPsec Encrypted SIP signaling.

   Procedure:
      1.  Configure a DUT according to the test topology shown in
          Figure 1 or Figure 2.
      2.  Set media streams per session to 0 (media is not used in this
          test).
      3.  Configure tester for IPSec.  Note the IPSec profile being used
          for and record it in Section 5.1.
      4.  Execute benchmarking algorithm as defined in Section 4.8 to
          get the session establishment rate with encryption.

   Expected Results:  Session Establishment Rate results obtained with
      IPSec Encrypted SIP may be lower than those obtained with
      plaintext SIP.

6.7.  Registration Rate

      To benchmark the maximum registration rate the DUT can handle over
      an extended time period with zero failures.

   Procedure:
      1.  Configure a DUT according to the test topology shown in
          Figure 1 or Figure 2.
      2.  Set the registration timeout value to at least 3600 seconds.

      3.  Execute benchmarking algorithm as defined in Section 4.8 to
          get the maximum registration rate.  This rate MUST be recorded
          using any pertinent parameters as shown in the reporting
          format of Section 5.1.  For example, the use of TLS or IPSec
          during registration must be noted in the reporting format.

   Expected Results:  Provides a maximum registration rate.

6.8.  Re-Registration Rate

   Objective:
      To benchmark the re-registration rate of the DUT with zero
      failures.

   Procedure:
      1.  Configure a DUT according to the test topology shown in
          Figure 1 or Figure 2.
      2.  First, execute test detailed in Section 6.7 to register the
          endpoints with the registrar and obtain the registration rate.
      3.  After at least 5 minutes of Step 2, but no more than 10
          minutes after Step 2 has been performed, execute Step 3 of the
          test in Section 6.7.  This will count as a re-registration
          because the SIP address of records have not yet expired.

   Expected Results:  The rate should be at least equal to but not more
      than the result of Section 6.7.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not requires any IANA considerations.


8.  Security Considerations

   Documents of this type do not directly affect the security of
   Internet or corporate networks as long as benchmarking is not
   performed on devices or systems connected to production networks.
   Security threats and how to counter these in SIP and the media layer
   is discussed in RFC3261, RFC3550, and RFC3711 and various other
   drafts.  This document attempts to formalize a set of common
   methodology for benchmarking performance of SIP devices in a lab
   environment.
