Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) Tag for Coordinate Reference
                       System (CRS) Specification
                        draft-clarke-cbor-crs-00

Abstract

   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 7049) is a data
   format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small
   code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the
   need for version negotiation.

   In CBOR, one point of extensibility is the definition of CBOR tags.
   An existing CBOR tag, 103, allows for the representation of
   geographic coordinates.  Proper exploitation of geographic
   coordinates requires an associated reference frame.  The present
   document defines a CBOR tag for referencing the coordinate reference
   system (CRS) for a geographic coordinate.  It is intended as the
   reference document for the IANA registration of the CBOR tag defined.

1.  Introduction

   Specifying geographic coordinates for a location on Earth requires
   the definition of a coordinate reference system (CRS).  A CRS is made
   up of several components: [EDS1]

   o  Coordinate system: The X, Y grid upon which your data is overlayed
      and how you define where a point is located in space.

   o  Horizontal and vertical units: The units used to define the grid
      along the x, y (and z) axis.

   o  Datum: A modeled version of the shape of the Earth which defines
      the origin used to place the coordinate system in space.  You will
      learn this further below.

   o  Projection Information: The mathematical equation used to flatten
      objects that are on a round surface (e.g. the Earth) so you can
      view them on a flat surface (e.g. your computer screens or a paper
      map).

2.  Objectives

   This document aims to address the specification of coordinate
   reference systems in CBOR [RFC7049] encoded data.  This is
   accomplished using complete CRS specification or through a well-known
   spatial reference identifier.

3.  Applicability

   This tag is designed for use with the Geographic Coordinates CBOR Tag
   103 [CBOR-GC].  A CRS may be attached to a Geographic Coordinate or
   it may specify a default CRS for an entire scope.  This is the
   expected application but this tag may be used in any relevant
   context.

4.  Semantics

   The CBOR CRS tag shall be associated with one of multiple CBOR data
   types.  Each allowed type is associated with a different method of
   specifying a CRS.

4.1.  Well-known Text

   OGC [OGC] Well-known Text (WKT) [WKT] is a standarized format for CRS
   specification.  When the CRS tag is associated with a Text String
   (CBOR Major type 3), the data shall be interpreted as OGC WKT.  This
   allows for complete CRS specifcation of and subtype of CRS.

4.2.  EPSG Spatial Reference Identifier

   A spatial reference identifier (SRID) is a unique value which
   unambiguously identifies a CRS.  Many vendors and registries provice
   SRIDs.  This association is not intended to allow specification of an
   arbitrary SRID, but provides a way to reference an SRID in the
   European Pertroleum Survey Group's (EPSG) SRID database.  EPSG
   numbers are a de-facto standard for CRS reference and are very
   commonly used.  EPSG numbers can be searched and referenced in a
   number of places including [EPSG.io] and [SpatialReference.org].
   When the CRS tag is associated with a basic numeric type (CBOR Major
   type 0), the data shall be interpreted as an EPSG SRID.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a tag from the Specification Required
   space, with the present document as the specification reference.

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC7049] apply; the tag introduced
   here are not expected to raise security considerations beyond those.
