    The Framework of Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA)
                    draft-zhou-supa-framework-01

Abstract

   Currently, there are network services that impose specific demands
   on a communication network. This document describes the SUPA basic
   architecture, its elements and interfaces.  The main SUPA
   architecture entities are the Service Management (SM) and the
   Network Manager/Controller (NM/NC). The SM is a functional entity
   that creates and runs network services by using a set of NM/NCs. The
   NM/NC is a functional entity that provides one or more of the
   following functions: (1) the generation, maintenance and release of
   network topologies, (2) the generation, maintenance, and release of
   network service-specific abstractions, (3) the mapping between
   network service-specific abstractions and the network topology, and
   (4) the mapping between network service-specific abstractions and
   network device configuration. Both the SM and the NM/NC may be made
   up of multiple distinct entities that collectively perform their
   functions.

1. Introduction

   As the Internet grows, new services are created, new devices are
   connected, and new users use the Internet. These and other factors
   contribute to the significant increase in the amount and type of
   network traffic. This in turn makes network management and
   configuration more and more complicated.

   However, the need for dynamic and real-time configuration changes is
   required. One example is Inter-Data Center (DC) traffic steering and
   tunneling, based on real-time network status. Dedicated network
   management applications are required to automate the complicated and

   dynamic network configuration present in today's systems. Such
   applications need interoperable data models of network topology,
   network services, and policy rules to support the design, deployment,
   and maintenance of network services. Providing these data models to
   network management applications may provide significant improvements
   in configuration agility, error detection, and uptime for operators.

   However, in order to scale and to ensure configuration change
   consistency, existing network configuration schemes must be
   simplified through the use of abstraction. This increases the
   programmatic control over such systems. Simplified models are able
   to provide a wide range of granularity for various applications and
   network services needs, from the lower-level physical network to
   high-level application services.

   An abstract view of a network infrastructure can be realized using
   one or more network topology data models. Each such topology model,
   whether physical or logical, may be used as its own reusable managed
   object. This enables existing topologies to be reused to create new
   topologies. This applies to models of different layers, including
   the application layer (L7), IP/network layer (L3), and lower layers
   (L0-L2, such as MPLS, SDH, OTN, WDM). The network resources may
   include physical and/or virtual network nodes and links.

   A network service data model is service specific, and usually relies
   on a network topology data model. The network service data model
   defines the behavior of the network service, which is characterized
   by one or more metrics that include performance, dependability, and
   security specifications.

   One method to automate service configuration is to use a policy data
   model. Policy, in conjunction with network service and device data
   models, can be used to tell the Network Manager/Controller (NM/NC)
   how to generate Network Element (NE) configurations using network
   service data models in combination with topology data models. For
   example, this process can be used to choose a path for VPN which
   will involve a set of NE's.

   The main goal of this document is to specify the SUPA reference
   architecture, its elements, and its interfaces.

   YANG data models (e.g., see [RFC6020], [RFC6991]) can be used for
   representing service and topology models.

        Figure 1 SUPA Framework

   An overview of the SUPA framework is shown in Figure 1. The network
   entities used in this framework are:

     SM: Service Management, which represents one or more network
     entities that are running and controlling network services.
        Policy Data Model
        Model of policy rules for managing the network service and
        mapping services dynamically to the network topology and
        network resources.
        Example of policy data model can be found in [TBD].

        There can be various types of policies, including service
        specific policies and network-wide policies. There can be a
        centralized entity managing the network-wide policies, which
        may be called as policy manager. The policy manager can be
        located in the SM or in a separate location.

Internet-Draft          SUPA Architecture            January 2015


        Service Management Data Model
        Model of the network service (e.g., VPNs) and the network
        resources required by the network service to be correctly
        deployed and executed on the physical and/or virtual topology.

        Example of service management data model can be found in
        [ID.draft-adel-vpn-service-management-model].

     NM/NC: Network Manager / Controller, which represents one or
     more entities that are able to control the operation and
     management of a network infrastructure (e.g., a network topology
     that consists of Network Elements (NEs)).

        Network Resource Data Model
        Model of the physical and virtual network topology including
        the resource attributes (e.g., data rate or latency of links)
        and operational parameters needed to support service
        deployment over the network topology.

        Example of network resource data model can be found in
        [ID.draft-contreras-supa-yang-network-topo]

     Network Element (NE), which handles packets based on the network
     management and controlling procedures. NEs can interact with
     local or remote NM/NC in order to exchange information, such as
     configuration information, policy enforcement capabilities, and
     network status.


   Service Management (SM) communicates with Network Manager/Controller
   (NM/NC) using an appropriate protocol, such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or
   RESTCONF [ID.draft-ietf-netconf-restconf].

   NM/NC exchanges configuration information with NEs and derives the
   current network topology that contains the NEs, and also the
   capabilities and status of NEs, which will be stored in network
   resource data model. NM/NC may also communication with traditional
   network management system to retrieve the above information. It can
   use existing network management and signaling protocols, such as
   I2RS [I2RS], NETCONF [NETCONF], RESTCONF [ID.draft-ietf-netconf-
   restconf], etc.

   Service Management (SM) will send policy data model and service
   management data model, which will in conjunction with network
   resource data model be mapped to detail NEs' configurations by
   network manager / controller.

   There are a wide variety of communication services offered by
   service providers.

   The Service Management (SM) is a functional entity, residing at the
   Application layer, which enables network services, such as:
      o) Network services (e.g., L2VPN, L3VPN, etc.)
      o) application-specific policies

   SM will push service management data model and policy data model to
   NM/NC for service deployment.

   Figure 2 NM/NC Functional Blocks

   Network Manager/Controller (NM/NC) is a functional entity that is
   able to generate and maintain desired and current topologies of the
   network infrastructure. As part of this process, it is also
   responsible for reserving and releasing network resources that are
   required to support network services in a given network
   infrastructure.

   The NM/NC contains a set of data models, functions and APIs,
   including:

   o) Network Resource Data Model
    Maintain an up to date topology of the network infrastructure,
    including capabilities and current status of NEs.

   o) Mapping: service specific topology
    This mapping procedure will combine the policy data model and
    service management data model and generate a specific topology.

   o) Mapping: target NE(s) detail configurations



Zhou, et al            Expires July 5, 2015                 Page 6







Internet-Draft          SUPA Architecture            January 2015


    This mapping procedure will use the service specific topology
    generated in the previous procedure and the service management
    data model to generate detail NE(s) configurations.

   o) NM/NC to traditional network management system interface:
   provides the interface with existing network management system
   protocols (e.g., I2RS [I2RS], NETCONF, etc.) to request
   configuration and status information, and push configuration changes
   to NEs.

   o) NM/NC to SM interface: used to support the communication between
   the SM and NM/NC. The candidate protocols used for this purpose
   could be either NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [ID.draft-ietf-
   netconf-restconf].

   An example of the mapping procedures can be that, a service requires
   that a link from A to B is created; and the policy requires that the
   hops of this link should not exceed N. Then when NM/NC receives the
   policy data model and service management data model from SM, it will
   first apply the policy data model to the network resource data model
   and get a sub-set topology which can fulfill the hops limit
   requirements. Then NM/NC will further generate detail configurations
   for target NE(s). The mapping procedures can be enforced by
   functional entity called policy agent.

   After the service is deployed, if there is a network topology change,
   network configurations for this service may need to be updated
   accordingly. A possible solution is to repeat the mapping procedures,
   and generate configurations for NEs (maybe another set of NEs). This
   requires that NM/NC maintains a copy of the service management data
   models and policy data models.

   For more detail about mapping mechanisms, please refer to [ID.draft-
   pentikousis-supa-mapping].


4.3. Network Elements

   The Network Element (NE) responds to requests and commands from the
   NM/NC and makes corresponding configuration changes. An NE may be a
   physical or a virtual entity, and is locally managed (e.g., via CLI,
   SNMP, or NETCONF).

   SUPA will specify mechanisms, in order to enable the NEs to interact
   with either local or remote network management systems. The
   interaction may include the exchange of information, such as
   configuration and status information. The NEs will be able to push
   this information in an event that the NM/NC can subscribe to, and/or
   provide this information after receiving a request from the NM/NC.


5. Security Considerations

   Security is a key aspect of any protocol that allows state
   installation and extracting of detailed configuration states. More

   investigation remains to fully define the security requirements,
   such as authorization and authentication levels.
