Abstract

   This document defines the connection-establishment precondition type
   for the SIP preconditions framework. Connection-establishment
   preconditions are met when a transport connection (e.g., a TCP
   connection) is successfully established between two endpoints.

Internet-Draft    Connection-Establishment Preconditions       July 2004


1.  Introduction

   RFC 3312 [3] defines a framework for preconditions for SIP  [2],
   which is updated by [4]. This document defines a new precondition
   type for that framework: connection-establishment preconditions.

   UAs (User Agents) use connection-establishment preconditions when
   they need to know whether a transport connection (e.g., a TCP
   connection) has been established successfully and is ready to carry
   user data.

   We define the connection-establishment precondition type following
   the guidelines provided in [4] to extend the SIP preconditions
   framework.

2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1] and indicate requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.

3.  Precondition Tag

   The precondition tag associated with the connection-establishment
   preconditions is "conn". This precondition tag is registered with the
   IANA in Section 10.

4.  Status Type

   RFC 3312 [3] defines two status types, end-to-end and segmented, but
   only the end-to-end status type applies to connection-establishment
   preconditions. So, connection-establishment preconditions MUST use
   the end-to-end status type and MUST NOT use the segmented status
   type.

5.  Direction Tag

   RFC 3312 [3] defines four direction tags: none, send, recv, and
   sendrecv. Once a transport connection is established, they indicate
   in which directions the connection can carry user data. For example,
   a successfully-established TCP connection would have an associated
   direction tag of sendrecv because it can carry data in both
   directions.

6.  Precondition Strength

   RFC 3312 [3] defines optional and mandatory preconditions, but only
   mandatory preconditions apply to connection-establishment
   preconditions. So, connection-establishment preconditions MUST NOT
   use optional preconditions.

7.  Suspending and Resuming Session Establishment

   According to [4], documents defining new precondition types need to
   describe the behavior of UAs from the moment session establishment is
   suspended due to a set of preconditions until is resumed when these
   preconditions are met.

   While session establishment is suspended due to
   connection-establishment preconditions, user agents SHOULD not send
   any user data over any media stream. Additionally, the UAS (User
   Agent Server) SHOULD NOT alert the called user.

   Offers with connection-establishment preconditions in re-INVITEs or
   UPDATEs follow the rules given in Section 6 of RFC 3312 [3].

      Both user agents SHOULD continue using the old session parameters
      until all the mandatory preconditions are met.  At that moment,
      the user agents can begin using the new session parameters.

8.  Examples

   TBD


   m=audio 20000 RTP/AVP 0
   a=curr:conn e2e none
   a=des:conn mandatory e2e sendrecv


9.  Security Considerations

   TBD.

10.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.
