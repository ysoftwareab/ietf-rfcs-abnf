                Cooperating Layered Architecture for SDN
                  draft-contreras-sdnrg-layered-sdn-01

Abstract

   The Software Defined Networking paradigm proposes the separation of
   the control plane from the data plane in the network nodes and its
   logical centralization on a control entity.  All the network
   intelligence is moved to this central entity.  Typically, such
   central entity is seen as a compendium of interacting control
   functions in a vertical, tight integrated fashion.  The relocation of
   the control functions from a number of distributed network nodes to a
   logical central entity conceptually places together a number of
   control capabilities with different purposes.  As a consequence, the
   existing solutions do not provide a clear separation between services
   and transport control.

   This document describes a new proposal named Cooperating Layered
   Architecture for SDN.  The idea behind that is to differentiate the
   control functions associated to transport from those related to
   services, in such a way that they can be provided and maintained
   independently, and can follow their own evolutionary way.

1.  Introduction

   Software Defined Networking (SDN) proposes the separation of the
   control plane from the data plane in the network nodes and its
   logical centralization on a control entity.  A programmatic interface
   is defined between such entity and the network nodes, which
   functionality is now simplified to purely perform traffic forwarding.
   Through that interface, the central control entity instructs the
   nodes and modifies their traffic forwarding behavior.

   All the intelligence is moved to such central entity.  Typically,
   such central entity is seen as a compendium of interacting control
   functions in a vertical, tight integrated fashion.

   This approach presents a number of issues:

   o  Unclear responsibilities between actors involved in a service
      provision and delivery.

   o  Complex reuse of functions for the provision of services.

   o  Closed, monolithic control architectures.

   o  Difficult interoperability and interchangeability of functional
      components.

   o  Blurred business boundaries among providers.

   The relocation of the control functions from a number of distributed
   network nodes to a logical central entity conceptually places
   together a number of control capabilities with different purposes.
   As a consequence, the existing solutions do not provide a clear
   separation between services and transport control.

   This document describes a new proposal named Cooperating Layered
   Architecture for SDN (CLAS).  The idea behind that is to
   differentiate the control functions associated to transport from
   those related to services, in such a way that they can be provided
   and maintained independently, and can follow their own evolutionary
   way.

   Despite such differentiation it is required a close cooperation
   between service and transport layers and associated components to
   provide an efficient usage of the resources.

      SLA: Service Level Agreement

3.  Architecture overview

   Current operator networks support multiple services (e.g., mobile,
   fixed, enterprise, etc) on a variety of transport technologies.  The
   provision and delivery of a service independently of the underlying
   transport capabilities requires a separation of the service related
   functionalities and, ideally, an abstraction of the transport network
   to hide the particularities of each technology while offering a
   common set of capabilities.

   Such separation can provide configuration flexibility and
   adaptability either from the point of view of the services or the
   transport network.  Multiple services can be provided on top of a
   common transport network, and similarly, different technologies can
   support a certain service.  A close coordination among them is
   required for a consistent service delivery.

   An example of that could be the guarantee of some Quality of Service
   (QoS) level.  Different QoS offerings could be present at both
   service and transport layers.  Vertical mechanisms for linking both
   service and transport QoS mechanisms should be in place to provide
   the quality guarantees to the end user.

   This document presents a proposal called Cooperating Layered
   Architecture for SDN (CLAS).  In this architecture the logically
   centralized control functions are separated in two blocks or layers.
   One of the layers comprises the service-related functions, whereas
   the other one contains the transport-related functions.  The
   cooperation between the two layers is considered to be implemented
   through open, standard interfaces.

   Figure 1 shows the CLAS architecture.  It is based on functional
   separation in the NGN architecture defined by the ITU-T in [Y.2011].
   Two strata of functionality are defined, namely the Service Stratum,

   comprising the service-related functions, and the Transport Stratum,
   covering the transport ones.  The functions on each of these layers
   are further grouped on control, management and user (or data) planes.

   In the CLAS architecture both the control and management functions
   are the ones logically centralized in an SDN controller, in such a
   way that separated SDN controllers are present in the Service and
   Transport strata.  Furthermore, the generic user or data plane
   functions included in the NGN architecture are referred here as
   resource plane functions.  The resource plane in each stratum is
   controlled by the corresponding SDN controller through an standard
   interface.

   The SDN controllers cooperate for the provision and delivery of
   services.  There is a hierarchy in which the Service SDN controller
   requests transport capabilities to the Transport SDN controller.
   Furthermore, the Transport SDN controller interacts with the Service
   SDN controller to inform it about events in the transport network
   that can motivate actions in the service layer.

   The Service SDN controller acts as a client of the Transport SDN
   controller.

   Despite it is not shown in the figure, the Resource planes of each
   stratum could be connected.  This will depend on the kind of service
   provided.  Furthermore, the Service stratum could offer a North Bound
   Interface towards external applications to expose network service
   capabilities to those applications.

3.1.  Functional strata

   As described before, the functional split separates transport-related
   functions from service-related functions.  Both strata cooperate for
   a consistent service delivery.

3.1.1.  Transport stratum

   The Transport stratum comprises the functions focused on the pure
   transfer of end user data between the communication end points.  The
   data forwarding nodes are part of the Resource plane.  These nodes
   are controlled and managed by the Transport SDN controller.  The
   Control plane in the SDN controller is in charge of instructing the
   forwarding devices to build the end to end data path for each
   communication.  Finally, the Management plane performs management
   functions on those devices, like fault or performance management, as
   part of the Transport stratum capabilities.

3.1.2.  Service stratum

   The Service stratum contains the functions related to the provision
   of services and the capabilities offered to external applications.
   The Resource plane consists of the resources involved in the service



Contreras, et al.       Expires February 12, 2015               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft          Layered SDN Architecture             August 2014


   delivery, such as computing resources, registries, databases, etc.
   The Control plane is in charge of controlling and configuring those
   resources, as well as interacting with the Control plane of the
   Transport stratum in client mode for requesting transport
   capabilities for a given service.  In the same way, the Management
   plane implements management actions on the service-related resources
   and interacts with the Management plane in the Transport stratum for
   a cooperating management between layers.

3.1.3.  Recursiveness

   Recursive layering can happen in some usage scenarios in which the
   Transport Stratum is itself structured in Service and Transport
   Stratum.  This could be the case of the provision of a transport
   services complemented with advanced capabilities additional to the
   pure data transport (e.g., maintenance of a given SLA).

3.2.  Plane separation

   The CLAS architecture leverages on the SDN proposition of plane
   separation.  As mentioned before, three different planes are
   considered for each stratum.  The communication among these three
   planes (and with the corresponding plane in other strata) is based on
   open, standard interfaces.

3.2.1.  Control Plane

   The Control plane logically centralizes the control functions of each
   stratum and directly controls the corresponding resources.
   [I-D.haleplidis-sdnrg-layer-terminology] introduces the role of the
   control plane in a SDN architecture.  This plane is part of an SDN
   controller, and can interact with other control planes in the same or
   different strata for accomplishing control functions.

3.2.2.  Management Plane

   The Management plane logically centralizes the management functions
   for each stratum, including the management of the Control and
   Resource planes.  [I-D.haleplidis-sdnrg-layer-terminology] describes
   the functions of the management plane in a SDN environment.  This
   plane is also part of the SDN controller, and can interact with the
   corresponding management planes residing in SDN controllers of the
   same or different strata.

Internet-Draft          Layered SDN Architecture             August 2014


3.2.3.  Resource Plane

   The Resource plane comprises the resources for either the transport
   or the service functions.  In some cases the service resources can be
   connected to the transport ones (e.g., being the terminating points
   of a transport function) whereas in other cases it can be decoupled
   from the transport resources (e.g., one database keeping some
   register for the end user).  Both forwarding and operational planes
   proposed in [I-D.haleplidis-sdnrg-layer-terminology] would be part of
   the Resource plane in this architecture.

4.  Deployment scenarios

   Different situations can be found depending on the characteristics of
   the networks involved in a given deployment.

4.1.  Full SDN environments

   This case considers the fact that the networks involved in the
   provision and delivery of a given service have SDN capabilities.

4.1.1.  Multiple Service strata associated to a single Transport stratum

   A single Transport stratum can provide transfer functions to more
   than one Service strata.  The Transport stratum offers a standard
   interface to each of the Service strata.  The Service strata are the
   clients of the Transport stratum.  Some of the capabilities offered
   by the Transport stratum can be isolation of the transport resources,
   independent routing, etc.

4.1.2.  Single service stratum associated to multiple Transport strata

   A single Service stratum can make use of different Transport strata
   for the provision of a certain service.  The Service stratum
   interfaces each of the Transport strata with standard protocols, and
   orchestrates the provided transfer capabilities for building the end
   to end transport needs.

4.2.  Hybrid environments

   This case considers scenarios where one of the strata is legacy
   totally or in part.

4.2.1.  SDN Service stratum associated to a legacy Transport stratum

   An SDN service stratum can interact with a legacy Transport stratum
   through some interworking function able to adapt SDN-based control
   and management service-related commands to legacy transport-related

Internet-Draft          Layered SDN Architecture             August 2014


   protocols, as expected by the legacy Transport stratum.  The SDN
   controller in the Service stratum is not aware of the legacy nature
   of the underlying Transport stratum.

4.2.2.  Legacy Service stratum associated to an SDN Transport stratum

   A legacy Service stratum can work with an SDN-enabled Transport
   stratum through the mediation of and interworking function capable to
   interpret commands from the legacy service functions and translate
   them into SDN protocols for operating with the SDN-enabled Transport
   stratum.

   applicability of this proposal
