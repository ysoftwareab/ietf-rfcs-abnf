                   draft-templin-6man-aeroaddr-04.txt

Abstract

   IPv6 interfaces are required to have a link-local address that is
   unique on the link.  Nodes normally derive a link local address
   through the use of IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
   and employ Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) to ensure uniqueness.
   This document presents a method for a node that obtains a delegated
   prefix to statelessly construct a link-local address (known as the
   "AERO address") that is assured to be unique on the link.

1.  Introduction

   IPv6 interfaces are required to have a link-local address that is
   unique on the link [RFC4291][RFC8200].  Nodes normally derive a link
   local address through the use of IPv6 StateLess Address Auto
   Configuration (SLAAC) and employ Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) to
   ensure uniqueness [RFC4861][RFC4862].  This document presents a
   method for a node that obtains a delegated prefix to statelessly
   construct one or more link-local addresses (known as "AERO
   addresses") that are assured to be unique on the link.

   Nodes that construct AERO addresses must have assurance that all
   other nodes on the link employ the same address autoconfiguration
   method.  This can be assured on links for which there is an
   "IPv6-over-(foo)" specification that mandates use of AERO addresses
   (e.g., see: [I-D.templin-intarea-6706bis]).  Other link types can be
   administratively coordinated (e.g., via network management) to assure
   that only AERO addresses are used.

2.  Terminology

   The terminology in the normative references applies.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  Lower case
   uses of these words are not to be interpreted as carrying RFC2119
   significance.

3.  The AERO Address

   An AERO address is an IPv6 link-local address with an interface
   identifier based on a prefix that has been delegated to a node for
   its own exclusive use.

   For IPv6, AERO addresses begin with the prefix fe80::/64 and include
   in the interface identifier (i.e., the lower 64 bits) a 64-bit prefix
   taken from the node's delegated IPv6 prefix.  For example, if the
   node obtains the IPv6 delegated prefix 2001:db8:1000:2000::/56 it
   constructs its corresponding AERO addresses as:

      fe80::2001:db8:1000:2000

      fe80::2001:db8:1000:2001

      fe80::2001:db8:1000:2002

      ... etc. ...

      fe80::2001:db8:1000:20ff

   For IPv4, AERO addresses are based on an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address
   [RFC4291] formed from the node's delegated IPv4 prefix.  For example,
   for the IPv4 prefix 192.0.2.16/28 the IPv4-mapped AERO addresses are:

      fe80::FFFF:192.0.2.16

      fe80::FFFF:192.0.2.17

      fe80::FFFF:192.0.2.18

      ... etc. ...

      fe80:FFFF:192.0.2.31

   Administratively-provisioned AERO addresses are allocated from the
   range fe80::/96, and MUST be managed for uniqueness by the
   administrative authority for the link.  For interfaces that assign
   IPv4 addresses, the lower 32 bits of the AERO address includes the
   IPv4 address, e.g., for the IPv4 address 192.0.2.1 the corresponding
   AERO address is fe80::192.0.2.1.  For other interfaces, the lower 32
   bits of the AERO address includes a unique integer value, e.g.,
   fe80::1, fe80::2, fe80::3, etc.  (Note that the address fe80:: is
   reserved as the IPv6 link-local Subnet Router Anycast address
   [RFC4291], and the address fe80::ffff:ffff is reserved for special-
   purposes; hence, these values are not available for administrative
   assignment.)

   AERO addresses that embed an IPv6 prefix can be statelessly
   transformed into an IPv6 Subnet Router Anycast address [RFC4291] and
   vice-versa.  For example, for the AERO address
   fe80::2001:db8:2000:3000 the corresponding Subnet Router Anycast
   address is 2001:db8:2000:3000::, and for the IPv6 Subnet Router
   Anycast address 2001:db8:1:2:: the corresponding AERO address is
   fe80::2001:db8:1:2.

4.  Applicability

   The AERO address is useful for mobile networks that comprise a mobile
   router and a tethered network of "Internet of Things" devices that
   travel together with the router as a single unit.  The mobile router
   assigns the AERO address to its upstream interface over which it
   receives a prefix delegation from a delegating router.  The manner
   for receiving the delegated prefix could be through static
   configuration or some automated prefix delegation service.

   Many other use case scenarios are possible (e.g., home networks) but
   the above case extends to multitudes of applications, e.g., a cell
   phone and its associated devices, an airplane and its on-board
   network, etc.  A similar uses case exists for a mobile node that
   obtains a delegated prefix solely for its own internal multi-
   addressing purposes.  These use cases are discussed in
   [I-D.templin-v6ops-pdhost].

5.  Implementation Status

   Public domain implementations exist that use the AERO address format
   as described in this document.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document introduces no IANA considerations.

7.  Security Considerations

   TBD
