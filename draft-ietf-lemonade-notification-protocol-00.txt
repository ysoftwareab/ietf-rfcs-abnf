Abstract 
    
   This document introduces a notification protocol as a specified 
   particular case of the notification mechanisms used by the Lemonade 
   profile [LEMONADEPROFILEBIS] in [NOTIFICATIONS].  
    
   This document also discusses the use of Lemonade notifications to 
   implement server to server notifications.

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and 
   server respectively. 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 
    
   An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or more 
   of the MUST or REQUIRED level requirements for the protocol(s) it 
   implements. An implementation that satisfies all the MUST or REQUIRED 
   level and all the SHOULD level requirements for a protocol is said to 
   be "unconditionally compliant" to that protocol; one that satisfies 
   all the MUST level requirements but not all the SHOULD level 
   requirements is said to be "conditionally compliant."  When 
   describing the general syntax, some definitions are omitted as they 
   are defined in [RFC3501].

   2.1.         Notification protocol in Lemonade Profile Bis 
    
   The target logical architectures involving the LEMONADE Profile and 
   notifications are discussed in [LEMONADEPROFILEBIS].

   Figure 1: Filtering mechanism defined in LEMONADE Profile bis 
   architecture. 
    
   In Figure 1, the notification protocol MAY be used between NF in the 
   Lemonade IMAP Store and a compliant Notification mechanism. 
    
   Note that in general [LEMONADEPROFILEBIS] does not mandate the use of 
   the present notification protocol. It is also possible that NF 
   interacts with the notification mechanisms via protocols specific to 
   each of the notification mechanisms. The present draft solely 
   provides a generic protocol to do so that the notification mechanism 
   MAY support. 
    
   2.2.         Notification protocol for generic server to server 
       notifications  
    
   As discussed in [NOTIFICATIONS], with server to server notifications, 
   a messaging system (e.g. email server, voice mail system, etc.) 
   submits alerts, which describe potential notification events, 
   regarding an end user mailbox status change (e.g. new message has 
   arrived, mailbox is full, etc.).  
    
   These alerts are sent to a notification mechanisms, which may, in 
   turn, generate an end user alert notification.

   The present notification protocol MAY be used as a generic way to 
   interface with each server to server notification mechanisms. 
    
   As described in {NOTIFICATIONS], it is also possible to interact with 
   the notification mechanisms via protocols specific to each of the 
   notification mechanism. The present draft solely provides a generic 
   protocol to do so that the notification mechanism MAY support.

   The notification protocol MUST follow the [PARLAYXMULTIMEDIA] 
   protocol (over SOAP).

   <Editor’s note: To be Done 
 
Security Considerations 
    
   Notifications must be secured (when useful information is sent) and 
   integrity should be checkable. 
    
   It should be possible to authenticate sender and prevent Denial of 
   Service attack via notifications.
