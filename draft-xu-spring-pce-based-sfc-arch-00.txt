               PCE-based SFC Architecture in SR Networks
                 draft-xu-spring-pce-based-sfc-arch-00

Abstract

   Service Function Chaining (SFC) provides a flexible way to construct
   services.  When applying a particular service function chain to the
   traffic, the traffic needs to be steered through an ordered set of
   service functions in the network.  This ordered set of service
   functions in the network, referred to as a Service Function Path
   (SFP), is an instantiation of the service function chain in the
   network.  Segment Routing (SR) technique can be leveraged to steer
   the traffic through the SFP in SR networks.  This document describes
   a PCE-based SFC architecture in which the PCE is used to compute a
   service function path (i.e., instantiate a service function chain) in
   SR networks.

1.  Introduction

   Service Function Chaining provides a flexible way to construct
   services.  When applying a particular service function chain to the
   traffic classified by the SFC classifier, the traffic needs to be
   steered through an ordered set of service functions in the network.
   This ordered set service functions in the network, referred to as a
   Service Function Path (SFP), is an instantiation of the service
   function chain in the network.  For example, as shown in Figure 1, a
   SFP corresponding to the SFC of {SF1, SF3} can be expressed as
   {Service Node 1, SF1, Service Node 2, SF3}.

   Segment Routing (SR) [I-D.filsfils-rtgwg-segment-routing] technique
   leverages the source routing and tunneling paradigms, which can be
   used to steer traffic through an ordered set of routers.  SR can be
   applied to both MPLS data plane
   [I-D.filsfils-spring-segment-routing-mpls] and IPv6 data plane
   [I-D.previdi-6man-segment-routing-header].
   [I-D.sivabalan-pce-segment-routing] specifies extensions to the Path
   Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) [RFC5440] that allow a stateful
   PCE to compute and instantiate an SR path.
   [I-D.xu-spring-sfc-use-case] describes a use case for SPRING where
   the SR mechanism is leveraged to realize the service path layer
   functionality of the SFC.

   This document describes an architecture for PCEP in which a stateful
   PCE is used to compute a SFP in SR networks.

2.  Terminology

   This section contains definitions for terms used frequently
   throughout this document.  However, many additional definitions can
   be found in [I-D.quinn-sfc-arch].

      Service Function (SF): A function that is responsible for specific
      treatment of received packets.

Internet-Draft             pce based sfc arch                 April 2014


      Service Function Chain: A service function chain defines an
      ordered set of service functions that must be applied to packets
      and/or frames selected as a result of classification.

      Service Node (SN): Physical or virtual element that hosts one or
      more service functions and has one or more network locators
      associated with it for reachability and service delivery.

      SF Identifier: A unique identifier that represents a service
      function within an SFC-enabled domain.

      SFC Classifier: An entity that classifies packets for service
      function chaining according to classification rules.  Packets are
      then marked with the corresponding SFC header.  SFC classifier is
      embedded in a SFC ingress node.

      Service Function Path (SFP): The instantiation of a SFC in the
      network.  Specifically speaking, it is an ordered list of service
      node locators and SF identifiers.

      Compact SFP: An ordered list of service nodes' locators.

      SR: Segment Routing

      SR Header: a MPLS label stack or an IPv6 SR header.

      SID: Segment Identifier

      Service SID : A locally unique SID indicating a particular service
      function on a service node.

      SR-specific SFP: It's a segment list representing a SFP.
      Specifically speaking, it's an ordered list of node SIDs and
      Service SIDs.

      PCC: Path Computation Client

      PCE: Path Computation Element

      PCEP: Path Computation Element Protocol

3.  PCE-based SFC Architecture in SR Networks

   When a packet enters an SFC-enabled domain, the SFC classifier
   classifies the packet for service function chaining according to the
   local policy rules, and then attaches an SFC header
   [I-D.quinn-sfc-nsh] to the packet which should include the SFP
   information.  As in this document SR technique is leveraged to steer

   the packet through the SFP, the SFC classifier therefore needs to
   attach a segment list which represents the SFP to the packet.
   [RFC5440] describes PCEP for communication between a Path Computation
   Client (PCC) and a Path Control Element (PCE).  In this document, the
   PCE is responsible for computing the SFP or the SR-specific SFP,
   while the SFC classifier constructs the SR header according to the
   path computation result returned from the PCE (as shown in Figure 2).

   Two methods will be discussed depending on the requested path type
   from the PCC:

      (1) The PCC requests a SFP.

      (2) The PCC requests a SR-specific SFP.

   For the first case, the SFC classifier needs to transform the SFP
   information to the SR-specific SFP information and then attach a SR
   header containing the SR-specific SFP information to the packets.
   For the second case, the SFC classifier can directly attach a SR
   header containing the SR-specific SFP information to the packets.
   The detailed will be discussed in the following sub-sections.

3.1.  Option 1: PCC Requests SFP

   The PCE is responsible to compute the SFP based on the network
   information, SF information, service requirements, etc.  How PCE
   computes the SFP is out of scope of this document.  The SFC
   classifier is responsible to transform the SFP to the SR-specific
   SFP.  The detailed procedures are described below:

      Step 1: The SFC classifier sends a PCReq message to the PCE to
      request a SFP or a compact SFP. two new setup types of the PATH-
      SETUP-TYPE TLV must be carried, indicating that a SFP or a compact
      SFPneeds to be setup.  The PCC also needs to carry an ordered set
      of SF Identifiers which indicates the SFC.

      Step 2: The PCE sends a response to the PCC, carrying an SFP or a
      compact SFP.

      Step 3: If the PCE returns a compact SFP, the SFC classifier
      transforms the SFP information into the SR-specific SFP
      information.  If the PCE returns a compact SFP, the SFC classifier
      needs to insert the corresponding SF identifier after each service
      node and then transform it into the SR-specific SFP information .

      Step 4: Upon receiving the packets, the SFC classifier classifies
      them for service function chain according to classification rules.
      Packets are then attacheded with a SR header containing the
      corresponding SR-specific SFP information.

3.2.  Option 2: PCC Requests SR-specific SFP

   The PCE is responsible to compute the SR-specific SFP based on the
   network information, SF information, service requirements, etc.  How
   PCE computes the SR-specific SFP is out of scope of this document.
   The SFC classifier is responsible to attach a SR header containing
   the SR-specific SFP information to the selected packets.  The
   detailed procedures are described below:

      Step 1: The SFC classifier sends a PCReq message to the PCE to
      request a SR-specific SFP.  A new setup type of the PATH-SETUP-
      TYPE TLV must be carried, indicating that an SR-specific SFP needs
      to be setup.  The PCC also needs to carry an ordered set of SF
      identifiers.

      Step 2: The PCE sends a response to the PCC, carrying a SR-
      specific SFP.

      Step 3: Upon receiving the packets, the SFC classifier classifies
      them for service chaining according to classification rules.

      Packets are then attched with a SR header containning the
      corresponding SR-specific SFP information.
