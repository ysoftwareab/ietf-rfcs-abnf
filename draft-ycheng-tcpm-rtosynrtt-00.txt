Internet Draft      Increasing TCP's Initial Window        February 2010


Abstract

   This document proposes seeding the retransmission timer by the RTT
   measured during the TCP connection establishment and updates the
   recommended approach in [RFC3390]. It discusses the motivation, the
   TCP  modification, and the experimental result.

Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.  Motivation

   [RFC3390] section 6. "Interaction with the Retransmission Timer"
   recommends not to sample the RTT during the three-way handshake when
   using a larger initial window. The concern is that the transmission
   time on narrowband links is a large portion of the RTT. Therefore
   seeding the RTO based on RTT of small SYN or SYNACK packets likely
   underestimates the RTT of larger data packets may cause spurious
   retransmission.

   While the example of 9.6kbps link used in the [RFC3390] remains
   valid, modern Internet is dominated by web applications over much
   faster links like DSL or cable broadband networks [AKAM10]. As a
   result, the recommended approach could cause noticeable latency
   impact on these networks. The Chrome browser data [BELSHE10] shows
   the web page by average is 320KB which consists of 45 resources
   downloaded from various domains. If the packet loss occurs during the
   initial HTTP request or response of the TCP connections and TCP fails
   to trigger TCP fast-retransmit due to insufficient DUPACKs, the
   senders will time out and retransmit after 3 second. 

   3 second is a long delay for today's Internet users: up to 40% of the
   users abandon the web page after 3 second [GOMEZ10]. Moreover,
   browsers or users often "reload" the web page by sending the same
   request over another (possibly newly created) TCP connection. In
   fact, some browsers try to bypass this hurdle by actively opening
   multiple TCP connections in quick succession and schedule HTTP
   request on the earliest established connection. Thus in addition to
   the latency impact, such unexpected long delays often result in
   aggressive network usage which waste more network and end systems
   resources. The situation calls for a TCP change to improve the
   latency problem.

2.  TCP Modification

   The document proposes to update [RFC3390] section 6. The RECOMMENDED
   approach is to sample the RTT during the three-way handshake and seed
   the retransmission timer (RTO), regardless of the size of the TCP
   initial congestion window. 

   The document also updates [RFC2988] to add in section 2 "The Basic
   Algorithm" step 2.2:

   (2.2) When the first RTT measurement R is made, the host MUST set

        SRTT <- R
        RTTVAR <- R/2
        RTO <- SRTT + max(G, K*RTTVAR)
        where K = 4

        If the R is made from SYN or SYNACK RTT measurement and less 
        than 1 second, the host MAY further increase the RTO by additional 
        D seconds. The RECOMMENDED value of D is 2*MSS*8/56000 to 
        accommodate transmission delay of 2 MSS size packets over a typical 
        56Kbps dial-up links or 1 MSS size packets plus the delayed ACK time.


   In a network path over 56Kbps modem of SYN RTT measured 400ms and MSS
   1460 bytes, D = 417ms. The seeded RTO after TCP handshake is about
   1.6 second.


4. Experimental Results

   The proposed TCP changes have shown 8% to 20% improvements on first
   HTTP download latency on a popular CDN among connections experiencing
   losses [CHENG10]. As expected, the change is most effective for small
   HTTP responses that have little chance to trigger TCP fast-
   retransmit. But even on larger downloads such as blogger photos
   achieve 12% reduction on TCP latency. On the other hand, the
   experiments has also shown only a slight 0.1% increase in the TCP
   retransmission rate. Based on the experiment results, we believe the
   seeding TCP RTO with RTT measured in handshake improves latency well
   with minimal impact to the network congestion.

5. Security Considerations

   This document discusses seeding the retransmission timer with the RTT
   measured during TCP handshake.  This change does not raise any known
   new security issues with TCP.

13. Conclusion

   This document recommends seeding TCP retransmission timer with the
   RTT measured in TCP handshake to improve the latency. It discusses
   the motivation, the proposed changes, and  the results of a large-
   scale Internet experiment.
