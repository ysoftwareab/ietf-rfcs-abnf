Internet-Draft              DHCPv6 IANA Rules                  July 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document modifies the IANA rules for some DHCPv6 (Dynamic Host
   Configuration Protocol for IPv6) [RFC3315] registries.  Rules for the
   following protocol registries are affected:

   o  DHCP Message Types [RFC3315]

   o  DHCP Option Codes [RFC3315]

   o  Status Codes [RFC3315]

   o  DUIDs [RFC3315]

   o  OPTION_LQ_QUERY Option [RFC5007]

   o  IEEE 802.21 Service Type [RFC5678]

   The rules for these registries are modified because there can be
   situations in which it is reasonable to grant an allocation in one of
   these registries under special circumstances.  Other DHCPv6
   registries already use "Standards Action or IESG Approval" as the
   Registration Procedures.

   In addition to changing the Registration Procedures for the DHCP
   Message Types registry, four new DHCP Message Types are added for use
   in experimentation and testing.

   The IESG, when this document was written in June, 2010, was reviewing
   a document for publication that required a new registration in the
   DHCP Option Codes registry.  The document defined a new DHCPv6 option
   defined by the SIP Forum, but was an independent submission to the
   IESG and intended for Informational Status.  Thus, the document would
   not meet the Option Code Registration Procedures of "Expert Review
   and Standards Action".  By changing the Option Codes Registration
   Procedures to "Standards Action or IESG Approval", the IESG can
   approve such registrations after review and consideration of the
   special circumstances.


2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update the Registration Procedures for the
   DHCPv6 registries DHCP Message Types, DHCP Option Codes, Status
   Codes, DUIDs, OPTION_LQ_QUERY option and IEEE 802.21 Service Type as
   specified below.  In addition, IANA is requested to add four new DHCP
   Message Types, which are to be used for experimentation and testing.
   All other DHCPv6 IANA Registrations Procedures are to remain

   unchanged.

2.1.  DHCP Message Types

   The Registration Procedures for the DHCP Message Types registry are
   "Standards Action or IESG Approval."  Previously, the Registration
   Procedures were "Expert Review and Standards Action."

   The following four DHCP Message Type values are reserved for
   experimentation and testing:

   Value          Description  Reference
   -----          -----------  ---------
   65532 (0xfffc) EXPERIMENTAL [thisRFC]
   65533 (0xfffd) EXPERIMENTAL [thisRFC]
   65534 (0xfffe) EXPERIMENTAL [thisRFC]
   65535 (0xffff) EXPERIMENTAL [thisRFC]

   As these message types reserved for experimental and testing
   purposes, no guarantee is made for interoperability among DHCPv6
   clients, servers and relay agents that use these experimental message
   types.

2.2.  DHCP Option Codes

   The Registration Procedures for the DHCP Option Code registry are
   "Standards Action or IESG Approval."  Previously, the Registration
   Procedures were "Expert Review and Standards Action."

2.3.  Status Codes

   The Registration Procedures for the Status Codes registry are
   "Standards Action or IESG Approval."  Previously, the Registration
   Procedures were "Standards Action."

2.4.  DUIDs

   The Registration Procedures for the DUIDs registry are "Standards
   Action or IESG Approval."  Previously, the Registration Procedures
   were "Standards Action."

2.5.  OPTION_LQ_QUERY option

   The Registration Procedures for the OPTION_LQ_QUERY option registry
   are "Standards Action or IESG Approval."  Previously, the
   Registration Procedures were "Standards Action."

2.6.  IEEE 802.21 Service Type

   The Registration Procedures for the IEEE 802.21 Service Type registry
   are "Standards Action or IESG Approval."  Previously, the
   Registration Procedures were "Standards Action."


3.  Security Considerations

   This specification does not change the security properties of DHCPv6
   and the specific components of DHCPv6 documented in the affected
   registries.

Appendix A.  Changes from RFC 3315, RFC 5007 and RFC 5678

   This document changes the IANA Registration Procedures for the DHCPv6
   DHCP Message Types, DHCP Option Codes, Status Codes, DUIDs,
   OPTION_LQ_QUERY option and IEEE 802.21 Service Type registries.  Ir
   also adds four DHCP Message Type values, which are reserved for
   experimentation and testing.
