   draft-mayrhofer-enum-xmpp-00
      initial draft


2.  Introduction

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].

   E.164 Number Mapping (ENUM) [1] uses the Domain Name System (DNS) [7]
   to refer from E.164 numbers [2] to Uniform Resource Identifiers
   (URIs) [4].  The registration process for Enumservices is described
   in section 3 of RFC 3761.

   The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [6] provides
   means for streaming Extensible Markup Language (XML) [8] elements
   between endpoints in close to real time.  The XMPP framework is
   mainly used to provide instant messaging, presence and streaming
   media services.

   RFC 4622 [5] registers an Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI)
   and URI scheme for identifying XMPP entities.  The Enumservice
   specified in this document allows the use of such "xmpp" IRIs/URIs in
   the context of ENUM.


3.  ENUM-specific XMPP considerations

   XMPP IRIs/URIs optionally contain an "Authority Component" (see
   section 2.3 of RFC 4622).  The presence of such an Authority
   Component in an IRI/URI signals the processing application to
   authenticate as the user indicated in the URI/IRI rather than using
   the preconfigured identity.

   In the context of this Enumservice, random clients may discover and
   use the XMPP URIs/IRIs associated to an E.164 number, hence in most
   cases those clients will not be able to authenticate as requested in
   the Authority Component.

   Therefore, URIs/IRIs results from processing an XMPP Enumservice
   records SHOULD NOT contain an Authority Component.

4.  ENUM Service Registration - XMPP

   Enumservice Name: "XMPP"

   Enumservice Type: "xmpp"

   Enumservice Subtype: n/a

   URI Schemes: "xmpp"

   Functional Specification:
      This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified is an XMPP
      IRI/URI.

   Security Considerations: see Section 6

   Intended Usage: COMMON

   Author: Alexander Mayrhofer <mailto:alexander.mayrhofer@enum.at>


5.  Example

   An example ENUM entry referencing to a XMPP URI could look like:

      $ORIGIN 6.4.9.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa.
      @ IN NAPTR 100 10 "u" "E2U+xmpp"
      "!^.*$!xmpp:some-user@example.com!" .

   (Note: Due to line length constraints, the example record above is
   split in two lines)


6.  Security & Privacy Considerations

   Since ENUM uses DNS - a publicly available database - any information
   contained in records provisioned in ENUM domains must be considered
   public as well.  Even after revoking the DNS entry and removing the
   refered resource, copies of the information could still be available.

   Information published in ENUM records could reveal associations
   between E.164 numbers and their owners - especially if IRIs/URIs
   contain personal identifiers or domain names for which ownership
   information can be obtained easily.

   However, it is important to note that the ENUM record itself does not
   need to contain any personal information.  It just points to a
   location where access to personal information could be granted.

   ENUM records pointing to third party resources can easily be
   provisioned on purpose by the ENUM domain owner - so any assumption
   about the association between a number and an entity could therefore
   be completely bogus unless some kind of identity verification is in
   place.  This verification is out of scope for this memo.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This memo requests registration of the "XMPP" Enumservice according
   to the definitions in this document and RFC 3761 [1].


8.  Acknowledgements

   Some text from RFC 4622 was used in the Introduction section of this
   document.
