1 Introduction

   This draft specifies a third generation wireless architecture that
   is consistent with the requirements set by the International
   Telecommunications Union (ITU) for International Mobile
   Telecommunications 2000 (IMT-2000)systems.  IMT-2000 systems will
   provide wireless voice, high speed data, and multimedia services.
   This draft has been developed by the Telecommunications Industry
   Association (TIA) Standards Subcommittee TR45.6.  As a guiding
   principle this draft has leveraged the use of RFCs and Internet
   drafts wherever possible, including  Mobile IP and AAA. A network
   reference model is provided, along with a set of more detailed
   requirements. Finally, a list of supporting RFCs and Internet Drafts
   is presented.

   The architecture supports roaming among service providers for both
   public and secure private network access. A key feature of this
   architecture is that the home agent may statically or dynamically
   reside in either a service provider network or external network such
   as a home ISP or private network. The architecture is designed for
   use with a traditional cellular network as a access medium; however,
   the majority of the architecture may be reused with a variety of
   access medium.

3 System Design Objectives

   1. Support a wide range of mobile stations and network
      configurations.
      * Support dynamic and static home address configurations
      * Support multiple simultaneous IP addresses.
      * Allow for dynamic assignment of the home agent as a form of
        route optimization.
   2. Provide seamless service during subscriber visiting between all
      networked systems.
      * This seamless service shall be possible while maintaining a
        formal customer-service provider relation with only one service
        provider.
      * The architecture shall allow IP mobility for visitors whose IP
        addresses are anchored in the home network, the serving network
        or an external data network administrative domain.
   3. Provide robust authentication, authorization and accounting
      services (AAA).
      * Provide separation of airlink resource AAA services and data
        (e.g. IP address) resource AAA services.
      * Provide complete AAA support services (e.g. broker services,
        key distribution, registration optimization, etc.).
   4. Provide QoS support
      * Support differentiated services

      * Coordinate with the access network


4  Service Model

   This section provides a definition of the packet data service as
   viewed by a mobile user. The packet data service may be depicted
   from a layered point of view.


4.1 Access Network

   The mobile station supports the appropriate radio access technology
   and signaling standards for the provider network to which it
   attaches. The access network will validate the mobile station for
   access service, and then establish a link layer connection to the IP
   network. After link layer is established, network layer protocols
   and procedures are executed to establish packet data service.

   Most of this document is independent of specific link layers.
   Examples of possible link layers protocols found in third generation
   wireless systems are:
      * PPP
      * General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) LLC
      * Simple HDLC

   This architecture could also be used in conjunction with various
   wireless LANs acting as access systems.


4.2 IP Network

   Two types of user services are defined:

      * Public Internet Access Service: Home agent resides in the
        service provider network, and authentication and authorization
        information is held and processed by any of the service
        provider network, home ISP, or private network.

      * Private Network Access Service: Home agent resides in an
        external network, and authentication and authorization
        information is held and processed in the external network. The
        external network is usually behind a firewall, and possibly has
        a pool of non-routable and non-unique addresses.

   The service provider network uses the NAI in the Mobile IP RRQ to
   determine the network in which the home agent resides. The
   subscriber will have the same access capabilities when in the home
   provider network, or roaming. The user may connect to multiple
   target networks at the same time, where the target can be an access
   service provider, home ISP or private network. In this case the user


Hiller et al.               Expires 09/99                            4
INTERNET DRAFT               3G Wireless                    March 1999


   would have multiple IP addresses, one per target network.  Access to
   a home ISP or private network is via IP secure tunneling.


4.2.1 Address Management

   Mobile IP service will support statically and dynamically assigned
   home addresses. A mobile may indicate a request for a dynamic home
   address assignment in the Mobile IP RRQ, or a mobile may indicate a
   static address. Home addresses may be public or private.

   Mobile IP service will support statically and dynamically assigned
   home agent addresses. A mobile may indicate a request for a dynamic
   home agent address assignment in the Mobile IP RRQ, or a mobile may
   indicate a static address. If the mobile requests dynamic home agent
   assignment, it must also request dynamic home address assignment.
   Home agent addresses must be public.


4.2.2 QoS

   The PDSN will be able to assign a user's packets to a specific
   differentiated service class on a per packet basis for transport
   across the IP network.  The PDSN will also be able to assign all of
   a user's packet to a specific differentiated services class on a per
   destination basis.

   The user's QoS level across the Access Network will be communicated
   to the PDSN. The PDSN will ensure that the differentiated services
   class assigned to the user's packets is consistent with the Access
   Network QoS.

   When HDLC or PPP is used as the link layer, the integrated services
   over low bit rate links framing-format will optionally be supported.

   End to end QoS with differentiated services will be supported using
   AAA consistent with IETF directions.


4.2.3 Multicast

   Neither the access network nor Mobile IP will provide native
   multicast services. Multicast service may be obtained via the use of
   IGMP.


4.3 Security

   From the perspective of the mobile station, security is provided at
   three levels in this architecture:

      * Radio access

Hiller et al.               Expires 09/99                            5
INTERNET DRAFT               3G Wireless                    March 1999


      * IP network
      * User end-to-end security

   These levels serve to prove the mobile's identity to the target
   network, and to protect data as IP packets are transmitted to and
   from the home agent.


4.3.1 Access Network Security

   Access network security may consist of air interface encryption and
   radio access key for authentication of the mobile station.


4.3.2 IP Network Security

   Authentication of the mobile station is via a shared secret between
   mobile station and the target network. A Mobile IP challenge in the
   Mobile IP advertisement (based on the shared secret) will also be
   used to stop replay attacks. For the case of a mobile station
   accessing an external network, the external network may use a shared
   secret not known by the service provider network to authenticate and
   authorize the mobile station.

   Encryption of user packets is via the dynamically established
   security associations between entities in the serving network and
   the target network. In some cases an AAA broker will be used to pass
   security information between the serving network and target network.


4.3.3 User End-to-End Security

   The user may add additional security measures which are independent
   of this architecture.


5 Network Architecture Overview

   This section provides a high level architecture necessary to provide
   the services previously described along with the basic functions and
   interfaces of each of the major entities. Also depicted are several
   common network configurations.


5.1 High Level Architecture

   The high level architecture is shown in Figure 1.  The six major
   entities that compose the network are the Home Agent, the PDSN, the
   AAA Server, the Access Network, the HLR/VLR, and Mobile Client.

      * Acts as a Mobile IP Client;
      * Interacts with the Access Network to obtain appropriate radio
        resources from the network for the exchange of packets;
      * Maintains knowledge of status of radio resources (e.g., active,
        standby, dormant);
      * Buffers packets from the mobile host when radio resources are
        not in place or are insufficient to support the flow to the
        network.


5.2 Interfaces and Protocol Architecture

   The protocols used for the interfaces between entities in the
   architecture are:

      * PDSN and HA: Mobile IP
      * AAA server to AAA server: AAA Protocol with Mobile IP, Proxy,
        and Reliable Transport extensions;
      * HLR and VLR: ANSI-41 or GSM-MAP
      * PDSN and AAA: AAA Protocol with Mobile IP and Reliable
        Transport extensions;
      * HA and AAA: AAA Protocol with Mobile IP and Reliable Transport
        extensions;
      * Access Network and PDSN: R-P Interface

   An end-to-end protocol model between mobile station and IP host is
   presented in Figure 2. This draft primarily addresses protocol
   layers above the link layer.

5.3 Common Network Configurations

   Considerable flexibility exists in this model.  The Home Agent may
   be statically or dynamically assigned and resides in some IP data
   network that is owned by either a service provider (home or
   serving), or an external network. The PDSN (contains the Foreign
   Agent), Visitor Location Register (VLR) and visited AAA server are
   owned by the serving network provider. The Home Location Register
   (HLR) is owned by the home access service provider.  AAA brokers may
   be provided by the service provider network or by an independent
   agency, or a combination.

   Figures 3 and 4 show network configurations for public Internet
   access service. In Figure 3, the home agent resides in the home
   service provider network and may be either static or dynamically
   assigned by the Home AAA server.  In Figure 4, the home agent
   resides in the serving network and is dynamically assigned by the
   Visited AAA server. This may be of particular benefit for
   international travelers, since it allows the traveler to gain
   service with an local access service provider while avoiding
   unnecessarily long routing.  The AAA broker may be necessary to
   facilitate communication between the visited AAA server and the home
   AAA server.

   Figure 5 shows a network configuration for private network access
   service in which the Home Agent is in an external network behind a
   firewall and may be either statically or dynamically assigned.
   There is no pre-established business relationship or security
   association between the serving network and the external network.
   However, a pre-established business relationship and security
   association exists between the serving AAA server and the broker AAA
   server, as well as between the external AAA server and the broker
   AAA server.

6 Network Architecture Requirements

   This section covers detailed requirements for the PDSN, HA and AAA
   servers.


6.1 Summary



Hiller et al.               Expires 09/99                           13
INTERNET DRAFT               3G Wireless                    March 1999


6.1.1 Mobile IP and AAA

   A  visited AAA server will support the PDSN and optionally will
   support the HA. The home AAA server will support a statically or
   dynamically assigned  HA, as requested by the mobile station.  For
   dynamically assigned HA, the visited AAA server will indicate to the
   home AAA server whether it supports dynamic HA assignment in those
   cases in which the mobile node requests dynamic assignment. If so
   indicated, the home AAA server may choose to allow the visited AAA
   server to perform the HA assignment. Otherwise the home AAA assigns
   the HA.

   The visited AAA will be able to use the domain portion of the mobile
   node NAI contained in a AA-Mobile-Node-Request (AMR) message to
   determine the home or broker AAA server to which to send the AMR.
   The home AAA server will be able to determine the user from the NAI,
   and respond to the visited AAA server with an AA-Mobile-Node-Answer
   (AMA). The home or visited AAA server will send the Home-Agent-MIP-
   Request (HAR) message to a HA, and subsequently receive the Home-
   Agent-MIP-Answer (HAA) from the HA.

   To achieve a faster handoff, the visited AAA server may receive the
   Previous FA NAI in the AMR message from the new FA that supports the
   mobile node. If the visited AAA server is able to use the Previous
   FA extension to determine the previous FA stored MN-FA and FA-HA
   keys, the visited AAA server will send the keys and SPI to the new
   FA rather than having to query the home AAA server.

   For Access Networks that are smaller, or that have smaller coverage
   areas, a handoff will be supported that does not involve the HA and
   local AAA server to reduce the number of registrations. In this
   scenario, local foreign agents belonging to the visited access
   provider form a tree-like hierarchy network  behind a common Foreign
   Agent. If the mobile moves to a new Foreign Agent, a Foreign Agent
   higher in the tree may return a Mobile IP Registration Reply if the
   mobile's registration has not expired.


6.1.2 AAA to AAA Security

   AAA to AAA communications is protected using IP Security. A Security
   Association must be created as part of the process of a service
   provider or broker and ISP or private network establishing a service
   agreement. Security Association establishment may be established via
   either manual or automatic mechanisms.

   There is an explicit agreement that if the private network or home
   ISP authenticates the mobile station requesting service, then the
   target network also agrees to reconcile charges with the home
   service provider or broker.

6.2 PDSN Requirements

      * Reside in the visited network and be allocated by the visited
        network where the mobile terminal initiates a service session.
      * Have a publicly visible IP address.
      * Support a unique link layer ID to the AN for each mobile
        connected to the PDSN, and maintain an association between the
        IP/HA address and the link ID. The link layer association is
        maintained even when the mobile is dormant, and can easily be
        recovered after a handoff from an old AN to a new AN.
      * Support a Foreign Agent with optional reverse tunneling. The FA
        associates the mobile node address with the HA address in order
        to support private, potentially overlapping private home
        addresses.
      * Terminate link protocol
      * Be associated with a AAA server in the same access service
        provider network in which the PDSN resides.
      * Verifies that the FA Challenge Response in an RRQ corresponds
        to a recent advertisement.
      * Act as an AAA Client to send the following information to the
        associated AAA server in an AA-Mobile-Node-Request (AMR):
      * Mobile IP RRQ
      * NAI
      * Session ID
      * FA Challenge
      * Mobile Response to optional FA Challenge
      * Optional Previous FA extension
      * Time stamp
      * Security information (initialization vector, integrity check
        vector, digital signature, and next routing AVPs)
      * Act as an AAA Client to receive the following information from
        the associated AAA server in an AA-Mobile-Node-Answer (AMA):
      * MN-FA and FA-MN security information
      * Session ID
      * Result code
      * Mobile IP RRP, optionally including HA address and MN home
        address
      * FA to HA security information
      * Time stamp
      * Security information (initialization vector, integrity check
        vector, digital signature)
      * Accounting session information (used in the home AAA server to
        combine accounting usage information).
      * Optional AVPs that carry differentiated services QoS
        information.
      * Support a secure tunnel to a HA.
      * Support optional differentiated service class information to be
        applied to all packets within the tunnel to the HA.
      * Support the AAA reliable protocol to the local AAA server.
      * Record usage information, optionally receive accounting
        information from the AN, and send to the local AAA server using
        the reliable AAA protocol.
