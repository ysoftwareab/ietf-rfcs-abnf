1. Introduction

   In this document as we refer to OSPF we mean OSPFv2 [Ref1].
   The scalability and stability improvement techniques described here
   may also apply to OSPFv3 [Ref2] but that will require further study
   and operational experience.

   A large network running OSPF protocol may occasionally 
   experience the simultaneous or near-simultaneous update of a large
   number of link-state-advertisements, or LSAs.  This is particularly 
   true if OSPF traffic engineering extension [Ref3] is used which 
   may significantly increase the number of LSAs in the network.  
   We call this event, an LSA storm and it may be initiated by an
   unscheduled failure or a scheduled maintenance event.
   The failure may be hardware, software, or procedural in nature.
 
   The LSA storm causes high CPU and memory utilization at the router
   causing incoming packets to be delayed or dropped.  
   Delayed acknowledgments (beyond the retransmission timer value) 
   result in retransmissions, and delayed Hello packets (beyond the 
   router-dead interval) result in neighbor adjacencies being declared 
   down. The retransmissions and additional LSA originations result in 
   further CPU and memory usage, essentially causing a positive feedback
   loop, which, in the extreme case, may drive the network to an 
   unstable state.

   The default value of retransmission timer is 5 seconds and that of 
   the router-dead interval is 40 seconds.  However, recently there 
   has been a lot of interest in significantly reducing OSPF convergence
   time. As part of that plan much shorter (sub-second) Hello and
   router-dead intervals have been proposed [Ref4].  In such a scenario
   it will be more likely for Hello packets to be delayed beyond
   the router-dead interval during network congestion
   caused by an LSA storm.

   In order to improve the scalability and stability of networks we
   recommend steps for prioritizing critical OSPF packets and avoiding

   congestion. The details of the recommendations are given in Section
   2.  A simulation study is reported in [Ref14] that quantifies the
   congestion phenomenon and its impact.  It also studies several of the
   recommendations and shows that they indeed improve the scalability 
   and stability of networks using OSPF protocol.  [Ref14] is available 
   on request by contacting the editor or one of the authors.

   Appendix A explains in more detail LSA storm scenarios,
   their impact, and points out a few real-life examples of control-
   message storms.  Appendix B provides a list of variables used in the
   recommendations and their example values.  Appendix C provides 
   some further recommendations and suggestions with similar goals.

2. Recommendations

   The Recommendations below are intended to improve the scalability
   and stability of large networks using OSPF protocol.  During
   periods of network congestion they would reduce retransmissions,
   avoid an adjacency to be declared down due to Hello packets 
   being delayed beyond the RouterDeadInterval, and take other
   congestion avoidance steps.  The recommendations are unordered
   except that Recommendation 2 is to be implemented only if
   Recommendation 1 is not implemented.

   (1) Classify all OSPF packets in two classes: a "high priority"
       class comprising of OSPF Hello packets and Link State 
       Acknowledgment packets, and a "low priority" class
       comprising of all other packets. The classification is
       accomplished by examining the OSPF packet header. While
       receiving a packet from a neighbor and while transmitting
       a packet to a neighbor, try to process a "high priority" 
       packet ahead of a "low priority" packet.

       The prioritized processing while transmitting may cause OSPF 
       packets from a neighbor to be received out of sequence.
       If Cryptographic Authentication (AuType = 2) is used (as 
       specified in [Ref1]) then successive received valid OSPF packets 
       from a neighbor need to have a non-decreasing "Cryptographic 
       sequence number".  To comply with this requirement we recommend 
       that in case Cryptographic Authentication (AuType = 2) is used 
       [Ref1], prioritized processing be not done at the transmitter.
       This will avoid packets arriving at the receiver out of sequence.
       However, after security processing at the receiver (including 
       sequence number checking) is complete, the OSPF packets may be 
       kept in a "high-priority" queue or a "low-priority" queue based
       on their class and processed accordingly.  The benefit of
       prioritized processing is clearly higher in the absence of 
       Cryptographic Authentication since in that case prioritization
       can be implemented both at the transmitter and at the receiver.
       However, even with Cryptographic Authentication it will be
       beneficial to have prioritization only at the receiver (following
      
   Choudhury et. al.     Best Current Practice               [Page 3]

   Internet Draft        Prioritized Treatment     Expires - June, 2005

       security processing).
       
   (2) If the Recommendation 1 cannot be implemented then reset the
       inactivity timer for an adjacency whenever any OSPF unicast
       packet or any OSPF packet sent to AllSPFRouters over a 
       point-to-point link is received over that adjacency instead of
       resetting the inactivity timer only on receipt of the
       Hello packet.  So OSPF would declare the adjacency to be down 
       only if no OSPF unicast packets or no OSPF packets sent to 
       AllSPFRouters over a point-to-point link are received over 
       that adjacency for a period equaling or exceeding the 
       RouterDeadInterval.  The reason for not recommending this
       proposal in conjunction with Recommendation 1 is to avoid 
       potential undesirable side effects.  One such effect is the 
       delay in discovering the down status of
       an adjacency in a case where no high priority Hello packets are
       being received but the inactivity timer is being reset by other
       stale packets in the low priority queue. 

   (3) Use an exponential backoff algorithm for determining the value
       of the LSA retransmission interval (RxmtInterval).  Let R(i) 
       represent the RxmtInterval value used during the i-th 
       retransmission of an LSA.  Use the following algorithm to 
       compute R(i)

                    R(1) = Rmin
                    R(i+1) = Min(KR(i),Rmax)  for i>=1

       where K, Rmin and Rmax are constants and the function
       Min(.,.) represents the minimum value of its two arguments.
       Example values for K, Rmin and Rmax may be 2, 5 seconds 
       and 40 seconds respectively.  Note that the example value for
       Rmin, the initial retransmission interval, is the same as the
       sample value of RxmtInterval in [Ref1].

       This recommendation is motivated by the observation that during
       a network congestion event caused by control messages, a major 
       source for sustaining the congestion is the repeated
       retransmission of LSAs.  The use of an exponential backoff 
       algorithm for the LSA retransmission interval reduces the rate 
       of LSA retransmissions while the network experiences 
       congestion (during which it is more likely that multiple 
       retransmissions of the same LSA would happen).  This in turn 
       helps the network get out of the congested state.

   (4) Implicit Congestion Detection and Action Based on That:
       If there is control message congestion at a router, its 
       neighbors do not know about that explicitly.  However, they 
       can implicitly detect it based on the number of unacknowledged
       LSAs to this router.  If this number exceeds a certain "high
       water mark" then the rate at which LSAs are sent to this router

   Choudhury et. al.     Best Current Practice               [Page 4]

   Internet Draft        Prioritized Treatment     Expires - June, 2005


       should be reduced progressively using an exponential backoff
       mechanism but not below a certain minimum rate.  At a future 
       time, if the number of unacknowledged LSAs to this router falls 
       below a certain "low water mark" then the rate of sending
       LSAs to this router should be increased progressively, again 
       using an exponential backoff mechanism but not above a certain 
       maximum rate.  The whole algorithm is given below.  It is to be 
       noted that this algorithm is to be applied independently to each
       neighbor and only for unicast LSAs sent to a neighbor or LSAs 
       sent to AllSPFRouters over a point-to-point link.

       Let,
       U(t) = Number of unacknowledged LSAs to neighbor at time t.
       H = A high water mark (in units of number of unacknowledged LSAs)
       L = A low water mark (in units of number of unacknowledged LSAs)
       G(t) = Gap between sending successive LSAs to neighbor at time t.
       F = The factor by which the above gap is to be increased during
           congestion and decreased after coming out of congestion.
       T = Minimum time that has to elapse before the existing gap
           is considered for change.
       Gmin = Minimum allowed value of gap.
       Gmax = Maximum allowed value of gap.

       The equation below shows how the gap is to be changed after a 
       time T has elapsed since the last change:
                 _
                |
                | Min(FG(t),Gmax) if U(t+T) > H
       G(t+T) = | G(t) if H >= U(t+T) >= L
                | Max(G(t)/F,Gmin) if U(t+T) < L 
                |_

       Min(.,.) and Max(.,.) represent the minimum and maximum values
       of the two arguments respectively. 
       Example values for the various parameters of the algorithm are
       as follows: H = 20, L = 10, F = 2, T = 1 second, Gmin = 20 ms, 
       Gmax = 1 second.

       Recommendations 3 and 4 both slow down LSAs to congested 
       neighbors based on implicitly detecting the congestion but
       they have important differences. Recommendation 3 progressively
       slows down successive retransmissions of the same LSA whereas
       Recommendation 3 progressively slows down all LSAs (new or 
       retransmission) to a congested neighbor.

   (5) Throttling Adjacencies to be Brought Up Simultaneously:
       If a router tries to bring up a large number of adjacencies to
       its neighbors simultaneously then that may cause severe
       congestion due to database synchronization and LSA flooding


   Choudhury et. al.     Best Current Practice               [Page 5]

   Internet Draft        Prioritized Treatment     Expires - June, 2005
                 
       activities.  It is recommended that during such a situation
       no more than "n" adjacencies should be brought up
       simultaneously.  Once a subset of adjacencies have been brought 
       up successfully, newer adjacencies may be brought up as long as
       the number of simultaneous adjacencies being brought up does not
       exceed "n". The appropriate value of "n" would depend on the 
       router processing power, total bandwidth available for control
       plane traffic and propagation delay. 
       The value of "n" should be configurable.

       In the presence of throttling, an important issue is the order 
       in which adjacencies are to be formed.  We recommend a First 
       Come First Served (FCFS) policy based on the order in which the
       request for adjacency formation arrives.  Requests may either be
       from neighbors or self-generated. Among the self-generated 
       requests a priority list may be used to decide the order in which
       the requests are to be made.  However, once an adjacency
       formation process starts it is not to be preempted except
       for unusual circumstances such as errors or time-outs.

   In some of the Recommendations above we refer to point-to-point links.
   Those references should also include cases where a broadcast network
   is to be treated as a point-to-point connection from the standpoint of
   IP routing [Ref5]

Appendix A. LSA Storm: Causes and Impact

   An LSA storm may be initiated due to many reasons.  Here
   are some examples:  

   (a) one or more link failures due to fiber cuts,

   (b) one or more router failures for some reason, e.g., software
       crash or some type of disaster (including power outage)
       in an office complex hosting many routers,

   (c) Link/router flapping,

   (d) requirement of taking down and later bringing back many 
       routers during a software/hardware upgrade, 


   Choudhury et. al.     Best Current Practice               [Page 8]

   Internet Draft        Prioritized Treatment     Expires - June, 2005


   (e) near-synchronization of the periodic 1800 second LSA refreshes
       of a subset of LSAs, 

   (f) refresh of all LSAs in the system during a change in software 
       version,  

   (g) injecting a large number of external routes to OSPF due to
       a procedural error,

   (h) Router ID changes causing a large number of LSA re-originations
       (possibly LSA purges as well depending on the implementation).

   In addition to the LSAs originated as a direct result of link/router 
   failures, there may be other indirect LSAs as well.  One example in
   MPLS networks is traffic engineering LSAs [Ref3] originated at other
   links as a result of significant change in reserved bandwidth 
   resulting from rerouting of Label Switched Paths (LSPs) that went 
   down during the link/router failure.
   The LSA storm causes high CPU and memory utilization at the router
   processor causing incoming packets to be delayed or dropped.  
   Delayed acknowledgments (beyond the retransmission timer value) 
   results in retransmissions, and delayed Hello packets (beyond the 
   Router-Dead interval) results in links being declared down.  A
   trunk-down event causes Router LSA origination by its end-point
   routers.  If traffic engineering LSAs are used for each link then
   that type of LSAs would also be originated by the end-point routers
   and potentially elsewhere as well due to significant changes in
   reserved bandwidths at other links caused by the failure and reroute
   of LSPs originally using the failed trunk.  Eventually, when the
   link recovers that would also trigger additional Router LSAs and 
   traffic engineering LSAs.

   The retransmissions and additional LSA originations result in further
   CPU and memory usage, essentially causing a positive feedback loop.  
   We define the LSA storm size as the number of LSAs in the original 
   storm and not counting any additional LSAs resulting from the  
   feedback loop described above.  If the LSA storm is too large then
   the positive feedback loop mentioned above may be large enough to 
   indefinitely sustain a large CPU and memory utilization at many 
   routers in the network, thereby driving the network to an unstable
   state. In the past, network
   outage events have been reported in IP and ATM networks using 
   link-state protocols such as OSPF, IS-IS, PNNI or some proprietary 
   variants.  See for example [Ref6-Ref9].  In many of these examples,
   large scale flooding of LSAs or other similar control messages 
   (either naturally or triggered by some bug or inappropriate 
   procedure) have been partly or fully responsible for network 
   instability and outage.

   In [Ref14] a simulation model is used to show that there 

   Choudhury et. al.     Best Current Practice               [Page 9]

   Internet Draft        Prioritized Treatment     Expires - June, 2005

   is a certain LSA storm size threshold above which the 
   network may show unstable behavior caused by large number of 
   retransmissions, link failures due to missed Hello packets and 
   subsequent link recoveries.  It is also shown
   that the LSA storm size causing instability may be substantially
   increased by providing prioritized treatment to Hello and LSA 
   Acknowledgment packets and by using an exponential backoff
   algorithm for determining the LSA retransmission interval.  
   If it is not possible to prioritize Hello packets then resetting
   the inactivity timer on receiving any valid OSPF packets can also
   provide the same benefit. Furthermore, if we prioritize Hello 
   packets then even when the network operates somewhat above the 
   stability threshold, links are not declared down due to missed 
   Hellos.  This implies that even though there is 
   control plane congestion due to many retransmissions, the data plane
   stays up and no new LSAs are originated (besides the ones in the 
   original storm and the refreshes).  These observations support
   the first three recommendations in Section 2. The authors of this 
   draft have also done simulations to verify that the other 
   recommendations in Section 2 helps avoid congestion and allows a
   graceful exit from a congested state.

   One might argue that the scalability issue of large networks should
   be solved solely by dividing the network hierarchically into 
   multiple areas so that flooding of LSAs remains localized within 
   areas.  However, this approach increases the network management 
   and design complexity and may result in less optimal routing between 
   areas. Also, ASE LSAs are flooded throughout the AS and it may be
   a problem if there are large numbers of them.  Furthermore, 
   a large number of summary LSAs may need to be flooded across
   Areas and their numbers would increase significantly if 
   multiple Area Border Routers are employed for the purpose of
   reliability. Thus it is important to allow the network to grow 
   towards as large a size as possible under a single area.  
   
   The recommendations in the draft are synergistic with a broader set 
   of scalability and stability improvement proposals. [Ref10] proposes
   flooding overhead reduction in case more than one interface goes to 
   the same neighbor.  [Ref11] proposes a mechanism for 
   greatly reducing LSA refreshes in stable topologies.

   [Ref12] proposes a wide range of congestion control and failure 
   recovery mechanisms (some of those ideas are covered in this
   draft but [Ref12] has other ideas not covered here).   

Appendix B. List of Variables and Values

   F    = The factor by which the gap between sending successive LSAs to
          a neighbor is to be increased during congestion and decreased 
          after coming out of congestion (used in Recommendation 4).
          Example value is 2.

   G(t) = Gap between sending successive LSAs to a neighbor at time t
          (used in Recommendation 4).

   Gmax = Maximum allowed value of gap between sending successive LSAs

Appendix C. Other Recommendations and Suggestions
 
   (1) Explicit Marking:  In Section 2 we recommended that OSPF packets
       be classified to "high" and "low" priority classes based on
       examining the OSPF packet header.  In some cases (particularly

   Choudhury et. al.     Best Current Practice               [Page 11]

   Internet Draft        Prioritized Treatment     Expires - June, 2005

       in the receiver) this examination may be computationally
       costly.  An alternative would be the
       use of different TOS/Precedence field settings for the two 
       priority classes.  [Ref1] recommends setting the TOS field to 0 
       and the Precedence field to 6 for all OSPF packets.  We recommend
       this same setting for the "low" priority OSPF packets and a
       different setting for the "high" priority OSPF packets in order 
       to be able to classify them separately without having to examine
       the OSPF packet header.  Two examples are given below:

       Example 1: For "low" priority packets set TOS field to 0 and
                  Precedence field to 6, and for "high" priority
                  packets set TOS field to 4 and Precedence field to 6.

       Example 2: For "low" priority packets set TOS field to 0 and
                  Precedence field to 6, and for "high" priority
                  packets set TOS field to 0 and Precedence field to 7.

       It is to be noted that the TOS/Precedence bits have been 
       redefined by Diffserv (RFC 2474, [Ref15]). It is also to be 
       noted that the different TOS/Precedence field settings suggested
       above only need to be agreed among the systems on the link.
       This recommendation is not needed to be followed if it is easy
       to examine the OSPF packet header and thereby separately
       classify "high" and "low" priority packets.

   (2) Further Prioritization of OSPF Packets: Besides the packets 
       designated as "high" priority in Recommendation 1 of Section 2 
       there may be a need for further priority separation among the 
       "low" priority OSPF packets.  We recommend the use of three 
       priority classes: "high", "medium" and "low". While
       receiving a packet from a neighbor and while transmitting
       a packet to a neighbor, try to process a "high priority" 
       packet ahead of "medium" and "low" priority packets and 
       a "medium" priority packet ahead of "low priority" packets.
       The "high" priority packets are as designated in Recommendation
       1 of Section 2.  We provide below two candidate examples for
       "medium" priority packets.  All OSPF packets not designated
       as "high" or "medium" priority are "low" priority.
       If Cryptographic Authentication (AuType = 2) is used (as 
       specified in [Ref1]) then prioritized treatment is to be
       provided only at the receiver and after security processing,
       but not at the transmitter since that
       may cause packets to arrive out of sequence and violate the
       requirements of "Autype = 2".

       One example of "medium" priority packet is the
       Database Description (DBD) packet from a slave (during the
       database synchronization process) that is used as an
       acknowledgment.

       A second example is an LSA carrying
       intra-area topology change information (this may trigger
       SPF calculation and rerouting of Label Switched paths and so
       fast processing of this packet may improve OSPF/LDP convergence
       times). However, if the processing cost of identifying and 
       separately queueing the LSA in this example is deemed to be high 
       then the implementer may decide not to do it.

   (3) Processing large number of LSA Purges: Occasionally some events
       in the network, such as Router ID changes, may result in a large 
       number of LSA re-originations and LSA purges.  In such a scenario
       one may consider processing LSAs in different order, e.g., 
       processing LSA purges ahead of LSA originations.  We, however,
       do not recommend out-of-order LSA processing for several reasons.
       Firstly, detecting the LSA type ahead of queueing may be 
       computationally expensive.  Out-of-order processing may also 
       cause subtle bugs. We do not want to recommend a major change in
       the LSA processing paradigm for a relatively rare event such as
       Router ID change. However, a Router with a changing ID may flush
       the old LSAs gradually without causing a storm.
