Internet-Draft        Reg Event Grouping Extension             June 2007


1.  Introduction

   In IMS a user may own more than one AoR.  All the AoRs owned by a
   user are conceptually linked in a so-called User Profile.  A user is
   free to use any of the AoRs he/she owns as the originating party
   identity when initiating traffic procedures, and other users may use
   any of those AoRs to contact the user.

   One of the leif motives of IMS is to support the provision of
   network-based value-added services to its users.  In order to achieve
   this a service architecture and corresponding data model are defined.
   A user may be provided with one or more so-called Service Profiles,
   which are data structures containing information related to the
   services enjoyed by that user.  For instance, one of the most
   relevant pieces of information stored in a Service Profile are the
   patterns that determine when the user's home proxy must select an
   Application Server (AS) as the next hop proxy for a SIP request.

   Service Profiles are further categorized into Individual Service
   Profiles and Shared Service Profiles.  An Individual Service Profile
   applies to one and only one of the AoRs owned by a given user.  On
   the contrary, a Shared Service Profile applies to two or more of the
   AoRs owned by that user.  Shared Service Profiles are useful when the
   AoRs to which they are associated represent aliases for each other.
   For example a user owning both a business AoR
   (sip:robert@example.com) and a private AoR (sip:bob@example.net) will
   probably have different Service Profiles associated to each of those
   identities.  The Service Profile for the business identity might
   determine that sessions from/to that identity pass through the
   company's virtual PBX AS while the Service Profile for the private
   identity might instead determine that sessions to/from that identity
   pass through the ISP's spam filter AS.  But when the user owns
   several AoRs that are aliases for each other
   (sip:robert.sales@example.com and sip:robert.support@example.com) the
   services afforded to those identities will be the same and thus it is
   useful that the Service Profile describing those services is shared
   between the alias identities.

   Therefore in IMS it is possible to assign a Shared Service Profile to
   multiple AoRs of a user in the IMS users database, the Home
   Subscriber Server (HSS).  The set of AoRs associated with the same
   Shared Service Profile are known as a Grouped Identities Set. A user
   may own multiple Grouped Identities Sets and it is commonly
   understood that the AoRs within a Grouped Identities Set are aliases
   to each other.

   It is foreseen that network nodes that are not the user's home proxy
   will need to know about the Grouped Identities Sets owned by a user.

   One of these nodes is the first hop proxy that connects a UA to the
   IMS network, the Proxy Call Signalling Control Function (P-CSCF).
   The P-CSCF acts as a Policy Enforcing Point (PEP) for network access.
   It would make sense that the same policies are applied to alias AoRs
   so it would be interesting for the Policy Decision Point (PDP) to
   know about the Grouped Identities Sets of a user in order to apply
   the same policies to all the identities in the same set.

   To allow the P-CSCF to know about the Grouped Identities Sets of a
   user an extension to the reg-event package is proposed that describes
   these sets.  Once a user registers any of the AoRs he/she owns the
   P-CSCF by virtue of its subscription to the reg-event package
   receives the identities that have been actually registered, including
   information about the Grouped Identities Set each AoR belongs to.

   A UA may also need to know about which identities are alias to each
   other.  One case would be when different groups of alias identities
   receive different charging rates.  A subscriber is charged
   differently depending on the AoR the user chooses for the
   communication so the user should know about those groups to decide
   which AoR to use at each moment.  Another case would be when a user
   has bound an AoR to a certain application (e.g. a work AoR is bound
   to the Enterprise Communicator application while a personal AoR is
   bound to the normal multi-media phone application).  When an incoming
   request is recieved at the UA for an AoR not explicitly bound by the
   user, the expected behavior at the UA would be that the right
   application is started and thus the UA needs to know the alias group
   to which the implicitly-bound AoR belongs.

   The extension described in this document can also be useful outside
   the context of the IMS. &F;or instance, in the open Internet a UA
   might implement a call barring service.  When a user sets up a call
   barring service usually he/she is trying to bar users, not
   identities.  The extension proposed in this document would allow a UA
   to know about the alias identities of barred users, so that by
   barring one of the identities the UA automatically bars any other
   alias identities within the same group as the former.

   The reg event package has provision for including extension elements
   within the <registration> element.  This document defines a new
   element that may be used in that context to deliver the membership
   status of each AoR to each Grouped Identities Set defined for the
   user.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]
   [1].


3.  Description

   A new element (<gr-id-set>) is defined which describes a Grouped
   Identities Set.

   This optional element is included within the body of a NOTIFY for the
   "reg" event package when one or more Grouped Identities Sets are
   defined amongst the AoRs included in the NOTIFY.  As many <gr-id-set>
   elements as Grouped Identities Sets are defined for the set of AoRs
   included in the NOTIFY are included by the notifier.  In this way
   both the AoR URI and the Grouped Identities Set it belongs to are
   then available to the watcher (e.g. the P-CSCF).

   The definition of a Grouped Identity Set is as follows: "the set of
   AoRs that are alias to each other".  This definition rules out
   redundant sets (i.e. sets that span exactly the same AoRs) and
   subsets (i.e. sets that span some AoRs from within those that are
   part of a larger set), since as per the definition above they are
   indeed the same set.

   Also notice that the definition above has the transitive property, so
   that if B is alias to A and C is alias to B then C is alias to A.
   This means that any two sets that share at least one AoR are actually
   a single set that spans the sum of the AoRs in the former sets.

   A corollary to the above paragraphs is therefore that at any given
   moment every AoR may belong to one and only one Grouped Identities
   Set.


4.  Notifier Processing of SUBSCRIBE Requests

   Unchanged from RFC 3680 [RFC3680] [2].


5.  Notifier Generation of NOTIFY Requests

   A notifier for the "reg" event package [2] SHOULD include the <gr-id-
   set> element when one or more Grouped Identities Sets are defined
   amongst the AoR(s) included in the reg-event body of the NOTIFY.
   When present, the <gr-id-set> element MUST be be positioned as an
   instance of the <any> XSD element within the <registration> element.

Internet-Draft        Reg Event Grouping Extension             June 2007


   If a notifier includes <gr-id-set> elements in event notifications,
   for each AoR that belongs to a Grouped Identities Set the notifier
   MUST include within the <registration> element which 'aor' attribute
   value matches said AoR one and only one <gr-id-set> element.

   For any two AoRs belonging to the same Grouped Identities Set, the
   <gr-id-set> elements within their respective <registration> elements
   MUST contain exactly the same text, with the only exception of
   leading and trailing white spaces, tab and CR/LF characters.

   For any two AoRs belonging to different Grouped Identities Sets, the
   <gr-id-set> elements within their respective <registration> elements
   MUST contain different text after discarding leading and trailing
   white spaces, tab and CR/LF characters.

   Note that the conditions in the two paragraphs above mutually exclude
   each other, i.e. any two AoRs cannot simultaneously belong to the
   same set and to different sets (since by the transitive property of
   Grouped Identities Sets those different sets are actually one single
   set).


6.  Subscriber Processing of NOTIFY Requests

   When a subscriber receives a "reg" event notification [2] with
   <registration> element(s) containing one <gr-id-set> element, it MAY
   compare the text within the respective <gr-id-set> elements after
   discarding leading and trailing white spaces, tab and CR/LF
   characters.

   Any AoRs whose respective <registration> elements contain a <gr-id-
   set> element with exactly the same text MUST be associated to the
   same Grouped Identities Set by the subscriber.  Any AoRs whose
   respective <registration> elements contain a <gr-id-set> element with
   different texts MUST be associated to different Grouped Identities
   Sets by the subscriber.  An AoR which <registration> element does not
   contain any <gr-id-set> element is either not associated to any
   Grouped Identities set by the subscriber, or associated to a singular
   Grouped Identities Set that spans only that AoR.

   The subscriber MAY use the information about the Grouped Identities
   Sets as it sees fit.  The identities within a given Grouped
   Identities Set MUST be considered aliases for each other by the
   subscriber and thus the subscriber can use them indistinctly when no
   indication otherwise exists.

   Subscribers that are unaware of this extension will, as required by
   [2], ignore the <gr-id-set> element.

7.  Sample reginfo Document

   Note: This example and others in the following section are indented
   for readability by the addition of a fixed amount of whitespace to
   the beginning of each line.  This whitespace is not part of the
   example.  The conventions of [8] are used to describe representation
   of long message lines.

   The following is an example registration information document
   including the new element:

8.1.  Example: Implicit Registration

   In an IMS network, a UA may send a single register message,
   requesting registration of an AoR.  The IMS network may actually
   register other AoRs, in addition to the one conveyed in the
   registration request (this is known as implicit registration in IMS,
   and the set of AoRs that are actually registered is known as Implicit
   Registration Set, IRS).  All the other AoRs the registrar knows
   belong to the same IRS as the AoR being requested by the UA get
   registered together with that AoR, as follows:

             REGISTER sip:example.com SIP/2.0
             Via: SIP/2.0/UDP 192.168.1.5;branch=z9hG4bKnashds7
             From: <sip:alice@example.com>;tag=3n8cf
             To: <sip:alice@example.com>
             Contact: <sip:user@192.0.2.1>;expires=3600
             Route: <sip:pcscf.foreign.net;lr>
             Path: <sip:pcscf.foreign.net;lr>
             Require: path
             Content-Length: 0

   The UE routes the request through the first hop proxy it knows it
   must use to access the IMS, in this case pcscf@foreign.net.

   The response reports success of the registration and returns the
   contact(s) assigned for the explicitly registered AoR.  It also
   indicates (via the P-Associated-URI header [6]) that there are other
   associated AoRs that may have been implicitly registered using the
   same contact.  But each of those implicitly registered AoRs may
   belong to the same or different Grouped Identities Sets as the
   explicitly registered AoR:

             SIP/2.0 200 OK
             Via: SIP/2.0/UDP 192.168.1.5;branch=z9hG4bKnashds7
             From: <sip:alice@example.com>;tag=3n8cf
             To: <sip:alice@example.com>;tag=fj3894f
             Supported: path
             Service-Route: <sip:scscf1.example.com;lr>
             Contact: <sip:user@192.0.2.1>;expires=3600
             P-Associated-URI: <sip:little_alice@example.com>,
                             <tel:+341234567890>
             Content-Length: 0

   The UA then subscribes to the 'reg' event package as follows:

   (The successful response to the subscription is not shown.)  Once the

   addition to the status for the requested URI, the status for the
   other associated URIs.

   whose each AoR belong.  The UA may then retain those sets for use
   them when the subscriber needs them.

9.  XML Schema Definition

   A Grouped Identities Set document is an XML document that MUST be
   well-formed and SHOULD be valid.  TRUU documents MUST be based on XML
   1.0 and MUST be encoded using UTF-8.  This specification makes use of
   XML namespaces for identifying TRUU documents.  The namespace URI for
   elements defined for this purpose is a URN, using the namespace
   identifier 'ietf'.  This URN is:
                      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:aliasinfo

        BEGIN
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <xs:schema targetNamespace="urn:3gpp:params:xml:ns:reginfo"
          elementFormDefault="qualified"
          attributeFormDefault="unqualified"
          xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
          xmlns:tns="urn:3gpp:params:xml:ns:reginfo">
          <xs:element name="gr-id-set" type="xs:Integer"/>
        </xs:schema>
        END


10.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations associated with this specification.

10.1.  URN Sub-Namespace Registration

   This section registers a new XML namespace, per the guidelines in
   [4].

   URI: The URI for this namespace is urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:aliasinfo

         this specification]]</a>.</p>
       </body>
      </html>
      END

10.2.  XML Schema Registration

   This section registers an XML schema per the procedures in [4].

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:aliasinfo.

   The XML for this schema can be found in Section 9.


11.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for the registration event package is
   discussed in RFC 3680 [2], and those considerations apply here.

   The addition of Grouped Identity Sets information to the registration
   event package provides a way for a subscriber to that package to find
   out the alias relationship between those AoRs belonging to the same
   set.  Since the network behavior is exactly the same for any AoR
   within the same group, revealing those relationships should not raise
   any security/privacy concern, since using an alias AoR does not open
   any new possibilities to parties using the alias AoR instead of the
   AoR they already know.
