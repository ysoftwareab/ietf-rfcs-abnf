                 BGP Optimal Route Reflection (BGP-ORR)
             draft-ietf-idr-bgp-optimal-route-reflection-22

Abstract

   This document defines an extension to BGP route reflectors.  On route
   reflectors, BGP route selection is modified in order to choose the
   best path from the standpoint of their clients, rather than from the
   standpoint of the route reflectors.  Multiple types of granularity
   are proposed, from a per client BGP route selection or to a per peer
   group, depending on the scaling and precision requirements on route
   selection.  This solution is particularly applicable in deployments
   using centralized route reflectors, where choosing the best route
   based on the route reflector IGP location is suboptimal.  This
   facilitates, for example, best exit point policy (hot potato
   routing).

   The solution relies upon all route reflectors learning all paths
   which are eligible for consideration.  Best path selection is
   performed in each route reflector based on the IGP cost from a
   selected location in the link state IGP.

2.  Introduction

   There are three types of BGP deployments within Autonomous Systems
   today: full mesh, confederations and route reflection.  BGP route
   reflection [RFC4456] is the most popular way to distribute BGP routes
   between BGP speakers belonging to the same Autonomous System.
   However, in some situations, this method suffers from non-optimal
   path selection.

   [RFC4456] asserts that, because the IGP cost to a given point in the
   network will vary across routers, "the route reflection approach may
   not yield the same route selection result as that of the full IBGP



Raszuk, et al.            Expires July 19, 2021                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft        bgp-optimal-route-reflection          January 2021


   mesh approach."  One practical implication of this assertion is that
   the deployment of route reflection may thwart the ability to achieve
   hot potato routing.  Hot potato routing attempts to direct traffic to
   the closest AS exit point in cases where no higher priority policy
   dictates otherwise.  As a consequence of the route reflection method,
   the choice of exit point for a route reflector and its clients will
   be the exit point that is optimal for the route reflector - not
   necessarily the one that is optimal for its clients.

   Section 11 of [RFC4456] describes a deployment approach and a set of
   constraints which, if satisfied, would result in the deployment of
   route reflection yielding the same results as the IBGP full mesh
   approach.  This deployment approach makes route reflection compatible
   with the application of hot potato routing policy.  In accordance
   with these design rules, route reflectors have traditionally often
   been deployed in the forwarding path and carefully placed on the POP
   to core boundaries.

   The evolving model of intra-domain network design has enabled
   deployments of route reflectors outside of the forwarding path.
   Initially this model was only employed for new address families, e.g.
   L3VPNs and L2VPNs, however it has been gradually extended to other
   BGP address families including IPv4 and IPv6 Internet using either
   native routing or 6PE.  In such environments, hot potato routing
   policy remains desirable.

   Route reflectors outside of the forwarding path can be placed on the
   POP to core boundaries, but they are often placed in arbitrary
   locations in the core of large networks.

   Such deployments suffer from a critical drawback in the context of
   best path selection: A route reflector with knowledge of multiple
   paths for a given prefix will typically pick its best path and only
   advertise that best path to its clients.  If the best path for a
   prefix is selected on the basis of an IGP tie-break, the path
   advertised will be the exit point closest to the route reflector.
   However, the clients are in a different place in the network topology
   than the route reflector.  In networks where the route reflectors are
   not in the forwarding path, this difference will be even more acute.

   In addition, there are deployment scenarios where service providers
   want to have more control in choosing the exit points for clients
   based on other factors, such as traffic type, traffic load, etc.
   This further complicates the issue and makes it less likely for the
   route reflector to select the best path from the client's
   perspective.  It follows that the best path chosen by the route
   reflector is not necessarily the same as the path which would have




Raszuk, et al.            Expires July 19, 2021                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft        bgp-optimal-route-reflection          January 2021


   been chosen by the client if the client had considered the same set
   of candidate paths as the route reflector.

3.  Modifications to BGP Best Path selection

   The core of this solution is the ability for an operator to specify
   the IGP location for which the route reflector should calculate
   routes.  This can be done on a per route reflector basis, per peer/
   update group basis, or per peer basis.  This ability enables the
   route reflector to send to a given set of clients routes with
   shortest distance to the next hops from the position of the selected
   IGP location.  This provides for freedom of route reflector physical
   location, and allows transient or permanent migration of this network
   control plane function to an arbitrary location.

   The choice of specific granularity (route reflector, peer/update
   group, or peer) is configured by the network operator.  An
   implementation is considered compliant with this document if it
   supports at least one listed grouping of IGP location.

   For purposes of route selection, the perspective of a client can
   differ from that of a route reflector or another client in two
   distinct ways:

   o  it can, and usually will, have a different position in the IGP
      topology, and

   o  it can have a different routing policy.

   These factors correspond to the issues described earlier.

   This document defines, on BGP Route Reflectors [RFC4456], two changes
   to the BGP Best Path selection algorithm:

   o  The first change, introduced in Section 3.1, is related to the IGP
      cost to the BGP Next Hop in the BGP decision process.  The change
      consists in using the IGP cost from a different IGP location than
      the route reflector itself.

   o  The second change, introduced in Section 3.2, is to extend the
      granularity of the BGP decision process, to allow for running
      multiple decisions process using different perspective or
      policies.

   A route reflector can implement either or both of the modifications
   in order to allow it to choose the best path for its clients that the
   clients themselves would have chosen given the same set of candidate
   paths.

Internet-Draft        bgp-optimal-route-reflection          January 2021


   A significant advantage of these approaches is that the route
   reflector clients do not need to run new software or hardware.

3.1.  Best Path Selection from a different IGP location

   In this approach, optimal refers to the decision made during best
   path selection at the IGP metric to BGP next hop comparison step.  It
   does not apply to path selection preference based on other policy
   steps and provisions.

   In addition to the change specified in [RFC4456] section 9, the BGP
   Decision Process tie-breaking rules ([RFC4271] section 9.1.2.2) are
   modified as follows.

   The below text in step e)

      e) Remove from consideration any routes with less-preferred
      interior cost.  The interior cost of a route is determined by
      calculating the metric to the NEXT_HOP for the route using the
      Routing Table.

   ...is replaced by this new text:

      e) Remove from consideration any routes with less-preferred
      interior cost.  The interior cost of a route is determined by
      calculating the metric from the selected IGP location to the
      NEXT_HOP for the route using the shortest IGP path tree rooted at
      the selected IGP location.

   In order to be able to compute the shortest path tree rooted at the
   selected IGP locations, knowledge of the IGP topology for the area/
   level that includes each of those locations is needed.  This
   knowledge can be gained with the use of the link state IGP such as
   IS-IS [ISO10589] or OSPF [RFC2328] [RFC5340] or via BGP-LS [RFC7752].

   The configuration of the IGP location is outside of the scope of this
   document.  The operator may configure it manually, an implementation
   may automate it based on heuristics, or it can be computed centrally
   and configured by an external system.

   This solution does not require any change (BGP or IGP) on the
   clients, as all required changes are limited to the route reflector.

   This solution applies to NLRIs of all address families that can be
   route reflected.

3.1.1.  Restriction when BGP next hop is BGP prefix

   In situations where the BGP next hop is a BGP prefix itself, the IGP
   metric of a route used for its resolution SHOULD be the final IGP
   cost to reach such next hop.  Implementations which can not inform
   BGP of the final IGP metric to a recursive next hop SHOULD treat such
   paths as least preferred during next hop metric comparison.  However
   such paths SHOULD still be considered valid for best path selection.

3.2.  Multiple Best Path Selections

   BGP Route Reflector as per [RFC4456] runs a single best path
   selection.  Optimal route reflection may require calculation of
   multiple best path selections or subsets of best path selection in
   order to consider different IGP locations or BGP policies for
   different sets of clients.

   If the required routing optimization is limited to the IGP cost to
   the BGP Next-Hop, only step e) as defined [RFC4271] section 9.1.2.2,
   needs to be duplicated.

   If the routing optimization requires the use of different BGP
   policies for different sets of clients, a larger part of the decision
   process needs to be duplicated, up to the whole decision process as
   defined in section 9.1 of [RFC4271].  This is for example the case
   when there is a need to use different policies to compute different
   degree of preference during Phase 1.  This is needed for use cases
   involving traffic engineering or dedicating certain exit points for
   certain clients.  In the latter case, the user MAY specify and apply
   a general policy on the route reflector for a set of clients.  For a
   given set of clients, the policy SHOULD in that case allow the
   operator to select different candidate exit points for different
   address families.  Regular path selection, including IGP perspective
   for a set of clients as per Section 3.1, is then applied to the
   candidate paths to select the final paths to advertise to the
   clients.

4.  Implementation considerations

4.1.  Likely Deployments and need for backup

   With IGP based optimal route reflection, even though the IGP location
   could be specified on a per route reflector basis or per peer/update
   group basis or per peer basis, in reality, it's most likely to be
   specified per peer/update group basis.  All clients with the same or
   similar IGP location can be grouped into the same peer/update group.
   An IGP location is then specified for the peer/update group.  The
   location is usually specified as the location of one of the clients



Raszuk, et al.            Expires July 19, 2021                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        bgp-optimal-route-reflection          January 2021


   from the peer group or an ABR to the area where clients are located.
   Also, one or more backup locations SHOULD be allowed to be specified
   for redundancy.  Implementations may wish to take advantage of peer
   group mechanisms in order to provide for better scalability of
   optimal route reflector client groups with similar properties.

5.  CPU and Memory Scalability

   For IGP based optimal route reflection, determining the shortest path
   and associated cost between any two arbitrary points in a network
   based on the IGP topology learned by a router is expected to add some
   extra cost in terms of CPU resources.  However, current SPF tree
   generation code is implemented efficiently in a number of
   implementations, and therefore this is not expected to be a major
   drawback.  The number of SPTs computed is expected to be of the order
   of the number of clients of a route reflector whenever a topology
   change is detected.  It is expected to be higher but comparable to
   some existing deployed features such as (Remote) Loop Free Alternate
   which computes a (r)SPT per IGP neighbor.

   For policy based optimal route reflection, there will be some
   overhead to apply the policy to select the candidate paths.  This
   overhead is comparable to existing BGP export policies and therefore
   should be manageable.

   By the nature of route reflection, the number of clients can be split
   arbitrarily by the deployment of more route reflectors for a given
   number of clients.  While this is not expected to be necessary in
   existing networks with best in class route reflectors available
   today, this avenue to scaling up the route reflection infrastructure
   is available.

   If we consider the overall network wide cost/benefit factor, the only
   alternative to achieve the same level of optimality would require
   significantly increasing state on the edges of the network.  This
   will consume CPU and memory resources on all BGP speakers in the
   network.  Building this client perspective into the route reflectors
   seems appropriate.

6.  Advantages and Deployment Considerations

   The solutions described provide a model for integrating the client
   perspective into the best path computation for route reflectors.
   More specifically, the choice of BGP path factors in either the IGP
   cost between the client and the nexthop (rather than the IGP cost
   from the route reflector to the nexthop) or other user configured
   policies.




Raszuk, et al.            Expires July 19, 2021                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft        bgp-optimal-route-reflection          January 2021


   The achievement of optimal routing relies upon all route reflectors
   learning all paths that are eligible for consideration.  In order to
   satisfy this requirement, path diversity enhancing mechanisms such as
   BGP add-path [RFC7911] may need to be deployed between route
   reflectors.

   Implementations considered compliant with this document allow the
   configuration of a logical location from which the best path will be
   computed, on the basis of either a peer, a peer group, or an entire
   routing instance.

   These solutions can be deployed in traditional hop-by-hop forwarding
   networks as well as in end-to-end tunneled environments.  In networks
   where there are multiple route reflectors and hop-by-hop forwarding
   without encapsulation, such optimizations SHOULD be enabled in a
   consistent way on all route reflectors.  Otherwise, clients may
   receive an inconsistent view of the network, in turn leading to
   intra-domain forwarding loops.

   With this approach, an ISP can effect a hot potato routing policy
   even if route reflection has been moved out of the forwarding plane,
   and hop-by-hop switching has been replaced by end-to-end MPLS or IP
   encapsulation.

   As per above, these approaches reduce the amount of state which needs
   to be pushed to the edge of the network in order to perform hot
   potato routing.  The memory and CPU resources required at the edge of
   the network to provide hot potato routing using these approaches is
   lower than what would be required to achieve the same level of
   optimality by pushing and retaining all available paths (potentially
   10s) per each prefix at the edge.

   The solutions above allow for a fast and safe transition to a BGP
   control plane using centralized route reflection, without
   compromising an operator's closest exit operational principle.  This
   enables edge-to-edge LSP/IP encapsulation for traffic to IPv4 and
   IPv6 prefixes.

   Regarding Best Path Selection from a different IGP location, it
   should be self evident that this solution does not interfere with
   policies enforced above IGP tie-breaking in the BGP best path
   algorithm.

7.  Security Considerations

   Similarly to [RFC4456], this extension to BGP does not change the
   underlying security issues inherent in the existing IBGP [RFC4456].

Internet-Draft        bgp-optimal-route-reflection          January 2021


   It however enables the deployment of base BGP Route Reflection as
   described in [RFC4456] to be possible using virtual compute
   environments without any negative consequence on the BGP routing path
   optimality.

   This document does not introduce requirements for any new protection
   measures, but it also does not relax best operational practices for
   keeping the IGP network stable or to pace rate of policy based IGP
   cost to next hops such that it does not have any substantial effect
   on BGP path changes and their propagation to route reflection
   clients.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not request any IANA allocations.

Appendix A.  Appendix: alternative solutions with limited applicability

   One possible valid solution or workaround to the best path selection
   problem requires sending all domain external paths from the route
   reflector to all its clients.  This approach suffers the significant
   drawback of pushing a large amount of BGP state and churn to all edge
   routers.  Many networks receive full Internet routing information in
   a large number of locations.  This could easily result in tens of
   paths for each prefix that would need to be distributed to clients.

   Notwithstanding this drawback, there are a number of reasons for
   sending more than just the single best path to the clients.  Improved
   path diversity at the edge is a requirement for fast connectivity
   restoration, and a requirement for effective BGP level load
   balancing.

   In practical terms, add/diverse path deployments [RFC7911] [RFC6774]
   are expected to result in the distribution of 2, 3, or n (where n is
   a small number) good paths rather than all domain external paths.
   When the route reflector chooses one set of n paths and distributes
   them to all its route reflector clients, those n paths may not be the
   right n paths for all clients.  In the context of the problem
   described above, those n paths will not necessarily include the
   closest exit point out of the network for each route reflector
   client.  The mechanisms proposed in this document are likely to be
   complementary to mechanisms aimed at improving path diversity.

   Another possibility to optimize exit point selection is the
   implementation of distributed route reflector functionality at key
   IGP locations in order to ensure that these locations see their
   viewpoints respected in exit selection.  Typically, however, this
   requires the installation of physical nodes to implement the
   reflection, and if exit policy subsequently changes, the reflector
   placement and position can become inappropriate.

   To counter the burden of physical installation, it is possible to
   build a logical overlay of tunnels with appropriate IGP metrics in
   order to simulate closeness to key locations required to implement
   exit policy.  There is significant complexity overhead in this
   approach, however, enough so to typically make it undesirable.

   Trends in control plane decoupling are causing a shift from
   traditional routers to compute virtualization platforms, or even
   third-party cloud platforms.  As a result, without this proposal,
   operators are left with a difficult choice for the distribution and
   reflection of address families with significant exit diversity:

   o  centralized path selection, and tolerate the associated suboptimal
      paths, or

   o  defer selection to end clients, but lose potential route scale
      capacity

   The latter can be a viable option, but it is clearly a decision that
   needs to be made on an application and address family basis, with
   strong consideration for the number of available paths per prefix
   (which may even vary per prefix range, depending on peering policy,
   e.g. consider bilateral peerings versus onward transit arrangements)
