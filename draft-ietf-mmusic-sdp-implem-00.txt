   Abstract 

      This document is written to track implementations of the features of 
      the Session Descritpion Protocol (SDP).

   1  Introduction 

      The table which follows uses this definition of interoperability: 
      transfer of a correctly composed and formatted session description 
      from a sender to a receiver, where the latter demonstrates 
      understanding of the description at the syntactic and semantic level.
