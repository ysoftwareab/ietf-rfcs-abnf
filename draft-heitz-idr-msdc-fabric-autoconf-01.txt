 Automatic discovery and configuration of the network fabric in Massive
                           Scale Data Centers
                draft-heitz-idr-msdc-fabric-autoconf-01

Abstract

   A switching fabric in a massive scale data center can comprise many
   10,000's of switches and 100,000's of IP hosts.  To connect and
   configure a network of such size needs automation to avoid errors.
   Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) protocols exist.  These can configure
   IP devices that are reachable by the ZTP agents.  A method to combine
   BGP, DHCPv6 and SRv6 with ZTP that can be used to discover and
   configure an entire network of devices is described.  It is designed
   to scale well, because each networked device is not required to know
   about more than its directly connected neighborhood.

1.  Introduction

   RFC7938 [RFC7938] defines a massive scale data center as one that
   contains over one hundred thousand servers.  It describes the
   advantages of using BGP [RFC4271] as a routing protocol in a Clos
   switching fabric that connects these servers.  A fabric design that
   scales to one million servers is considered enough for the forseeable
   future and is the design goal of this document.  Of course, the
   design should also work for smaller fabrics.  A switch fabric to
   connect one million servers will consist of between 35000 and 130000
   switches and 1.5 million to 8 million links, depending on how



Heitz, et al.              Expires May 8, 2019                  [Page 2]

Internet-Draft        MSDC Fabric Autoconfiguration        November 2018


   redundantly the servers are connected to the fabric and the level of
   oversubscription in the fabric.  A switch that needs to store, send
   and operate on hundreds of routes is clearly cheaper than one that
   needs to store, send and operate on millions of links.

   Such a network requires significant configuration on each switch and
   many cables to connect.  This is an onerous task without automation.

2.  Requirements

   To configure a fabric network for massive scale data centers.

   To detect every cabling error.  For example, a spine switch that has
   a different number of links into one pod than into another pod in a
   Clos fabric.

   Any devices should be interchangeable with another device of
   equivalent functionality without requiring configuration changes.
   That means if a device breaks, it can be replaced by any other device
   of equivalent functionality without any changes to its configuration.
   Even if a replacement device already has configuration, it should
   still work in its new position.

   A device may have configuration, but such configuration MUST NOT
   depend on the location of the device in the network.  Therefore, no
   IP addresses should be pre-configured on any devices.  No fabric tier
   should be needed.

   For scalability, every device must not need to know how to reach
   every other device.  Only the controller should be expected to know
   the entire topology.

   If two such auto-discovering/auto-configuring networks are connected
   together, the function of discovery/configuration in one network must
   not disturb this function in the other network.

   Separate cabling for a management network must not be required.

   The network should function even if the controllers are disconnected.
   The controller should only be needed to discover and configure
   devices to the network.  Device and link failures and restoration
   should not require the controller.  If a device is moved or
   reconnected in a way that requires reconfiguration, then the
   controller is required to discover the new topology and to change the
   configuration accordingly.

   The protocol does not need to be fast.

   The controller must be able to reach any device if there is any way
   at all to reach it, even if that is multiple hops between spine
   switches or any other path that may be disallowed in a normal Clos
   network.  At the same time, normal traffic must remain restricted to
   allowable paths.

   The routing protocol for normal traffic must be fast and efficient.

   The network must scale to 1 million connected servers and 8 million
   links in the fabric.

3.  Solution Overview

   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] and ZTP are used to discover and configure devices
   reachable by the controller.  As the controller configures devices,
   it configures them to be DHCP relay agents.  This makes more devices
   reachable by the new DHCP relay agents, allowing the new devices to
   be configured.  As this configuration process proceeds further away
   from the controller, it configures BGP to ensure reachabillity to all
   devices even if links were to fail.  For scalability, each device
   knows only its directly connected neighbors and a route to the
   controller.  Every device can send a packet to the controller,
   because every device knows a route to the controller.  To send a
   packet from the controller to a specific target device is harder,
   because the devices between the controller and the target do not know
   how to reach the target device.  The controller is the only device
   that knows the topology between itself and the devices it needs to
   reach.  To send a packet to a target device, the controller builds an
   SRv6 (Segment Routing v6) segment list.  As each device receives a
   packet, it will place the next segment IPv6 address into the
   destination IPv6 address field and forward the packet to the next
   device.

   After the network discovery is complete, the controller will validate
   the discovered topology against an internal description and go back
   and configure application dependent state into the devices and/or
   report connection anomalies.  An example description might be "Clos
   fabric connecting servers and DCI pods".  Since a Clos fabric looks
   the same upside down, the controller needs to identify servers,
   switches and DCI routers.  This is done with DHCP vendor class
   options.

   In certain environments, it is required for devices to authenticate
   the network and for the network to authenticate devices.  TCP-AO
   [RFC5925] can be used to authenticate BGP sessions.  SZTP
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-zerotouch] provides for authentication during the
   ZTP process.  Netconf can be used over SSH as described in [RFC6242].

4.  Solution Details

   Each device needs a unique identifier.  This may be printed on the
   device.  For easy servicability, a device must have a single
   identifier, visible on the outside of the device and by the
   controller.  This will be the DUID in the DHCPv6 Client Identifier
   Option.

   In order to discover the topology, the controller needs to know every
   link in the topology.  This means the device ID and interface ID or
   interface address at each end of every link.  DHCPv6 can be used to
   obtain that information.  For each link, one end of the link is the
   device that requests an address.  The other end of the link is either
   the controller itself or a DHCP relay agent.  The DHCP relay agent
   relays all client requests back to the controller.

   Configuration proceeds in waves.  The wave of configuration
   propagates away from the controller.  In the first wave, a controller
   allocates a routable ipv6 address to each device directly connected
   to the controller.  These devices comprise the first wave.  The
   controller will then configure each of these devices using a ZTP
   protocol, such as [I-D.ietf-netconf-zerotouch].  The configuration
   for each device will include the following items:

     - A routable Ipv6 address for each of its interfaces that have not
       already acquired one by DHCP.

     - A routable Ipv6 address for the loopback interface.

     - Configuration to act as a DHCPv6 relay agent for the next wave of
       devices.

     - Configuration for a BGP session to each of its connected
       neighbors.  That BGP session will initially be down, but will
       establish once the neighbors are connected and configured.  These
       sessions are single hop directly connected EBGP sessions.

     - Configuration for a BGP session to the controller.  This is a
       multi-hop EBGP session using the loopback address.

   Each BGP speaker requires an AS number and a router ID.  The
   controller should allocate a different BGP AS number for each device.
   There are plenty of private 4-octet ASNs available.  The value of the
   router ID is not important.

   After the first wave of devices is configured, these devices become
   DHCPv6 relay agents.  They are now in a position to accept DHCPv6
   SOLICIT messages and relay them to the controller.  The controller



Heitz, et al.              Expires May 8, 2019                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft        MSDC Fabric Autoconfiguration        November 2018


   acts as the DHCPv6 server.  As each wave is configured, the BGP
   sessions on each device ensure that every device has a route to the
   controller.  In this way, each DHCPv6 relay agent can communicate
   with the controller.  A DHCP packet relayed by a device in the second
   wave is not relayed again by a device in the first wave.  The device
   in the second wave has an IP connection to the controller through
   which it relays the messages.

   The controller will allocate a different IP address for each
   interface for each device in the network.  When the controller
   receives DHCP requests from DHCP relay agents, it will recognize the
   DHCP relay agent end of the link from the link-address field in the
   relay-forward message.  The controller will note the DUID in the DHCP
   request to keep track of the device making the request.  Because it
   already knows the DUID of the DHCP relay agent from its IP address,
   it can tie the two devices together by their DUID.

   The controller must keep track of the DUID in every DHCP request, so
   that it can recognize different interfaces on the same device.  This
   is needed to detect looped cables and to prevent the controller
   attempting to use ZTP to configure a single device through multiple
   links at the same time.

5.  DHCP Procedures

   When a switch acquires an IP address on an interface, it starts
   sending IPv6 Router Advertisements on that interface.  It includes
   the IP address prefix in the Prefix Information Option in the Router
   Advertisement.  The L bit MUST be set and the A bit MUST be clear.
   If the switch has been configured as a DHCP relay and has a BGP route
   to the controller, then it will set the M bit in the Router
   Advertisement, otherwise it clears both the M and O bits.

   If a device requires an IP address on an interface and it hears a
   Router Advertisement with the M bit set, it will send a DHCPv6
   SOLICIT message to request an IP address.  Any SOLICIT message sent
   must include the following items:

     - Client Identifier Option with the DUID.

     - User Class Option to indicate the name of the network it is
       attempting to join.  This is to prevent the controller from
       configuring devices attached to the network that are not part of
       the network to be configured.

     - Vendor Class Option to indicate the type of device.

     - If the link is point-to-point, then the Rapid Commit Option.

Internet-Draft        MSDC Fabric Autoconfiguration        November 2018


     - A single Identity Association Option.  This option must be for a
       non-temporary address and must be for the address of the
       interface on which it is being sent.  This allows the controller
       to learn the interface on which the DHCP client is sending the
       SOLICIT message.

   When a DHCP Relay Agent receives a SOLICIT message, it encapsulates
   it into a relay-forward message and sends it to the controller.  It
   puts its loopback IP address into the source IP address field in the
   IP header of the packet.

5.1.  Inconsistent Endpoints

   Two endpoints of a link may have different IP address prefixes that
   do not overlap.  This prevents IP forwarding on the link.  The
   controller will never assign prefixes this way.  This condition may
   occur in the following cases:

     - The controller assigned addresses to interfaces on two devices
       via ZTP and it did not know that these devices had a link between
       them.  This is a normal occurrance.

     - Some cables were unplugged from a device under maintenance and
       then plugged back in in a different way.

     - A device was removed from its location in a topology and replaced
       in another location without having its configuration erased.

   The controller can repair all these cases automatically.

   If a device has an IP address on an interface and it hears a Router
   Advertisement that includes a Prefix Information Option, the prefix
   of which is different to its own prefix, then the following applies.
   If the Router Advertisement does not have the M bit set, then the
   device does nothing further.  The interface will not be able to send
   IP packets.  If the Router Advertisement has the M bit set, then it
   will send a DHCPv6 SOLICIT message to get a new IP address.  Both
   sides of a link may do this and the SOLICIT messages will cross.  The
   controller will receive both of them.  When it receives the second
   SOLICIT, it will recognize it as being from the other end of the same
   link and allocate the appropriate address.

6.  Link State Database

   The controller will maintain a link state database of each link it
   learns.  This is conceptual and implementations may differ.

   First is the device table.  Each device is associated with:



Heitz, et al.              Expires May 8, 2019                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        MSDC Fabric Autoconfiguration        November 2018


     - DHCP DUID.  The controller learns this from the DHCP SOLICIT
       message received from the device.

     - Device type.  This is learnt from the DHCP Vendor Class Option
       from the DHCP SOLICIT message received from the device.  It is
       used to recognize the topology and match it with the description
       of the required topology after the complete topology is
       discovered.

     - Loopback IP address.  The controller assigns this to the device
       during ZTP.  It is advertised to BGP sessions to neighboring
       devices.  When those neighors receive it, they advertise it to
       the controller and install it.  They do not advertise it to other
       neighbors.  This address is used as the endpoint for the BGP
       connection between the device and the controller.  When the
       device is acting as DHCP Relay Agent, this address appears in the
       source IP address field in the IP header in the relay-forward
       message.

   Next is the endpoint table.  Each endpoint is associated with:

     - Reference to the device hosting this endpoint.

     - IAID.  The controller learns this from the DHCP SOLICIT message
       received from the device.

     - Reference to the endpoint at the other end of the link if there
       is one.

     - Local IP address with prefix length.  The controller assigns this
       address either in a DHCP REPLY message or during ZTP.  When the
       device is acting as DHCP Relay Agent, this address appears in the
       link-address field in the relay-forward message.  This is used as
       the endpoint of a BGP session to the neighboring device.  The
       host address (/128) is advertised as a network address to the BGP
       session across the link of this endpoint.  When that neighbor
       receives the route, it will not install the route, but advertise
       it to the controller only.  The controller uses that route, or
       rather the lack of the route, to know when the link has failed.
       The controller knows that the link exists from the DHCP SOLICIT
       message.

7.  BGP Procedures

   The controller will advertise its own loopback address to all the
   directly connected BGP neighbors with a community to identify it as
   the controller address.  This IP address will be advertised by all




Heitz, et al.              Expires May 8, 2019                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft        MSDC Fabric Autoconfiguration        November 2018


   devices to their directly connected BGP neighbors.  The devices will
   use this BGP route to forward packets to the controller.

   Each device will announce its interface addresses to the BGP
   connections of its directly connected neighbors tagged with a
   community.  These routes will be re-announced only to the BGP session
   to the controller and not to directly connected neighbors.  The BGP
   connections can be made to fail upon interface down or BFD down.  BFD
   should only operate on the BGP sessions to directly connected
   neighbors, not on the session to the controller.

   The controller will host one multihop BGP session with every device
   in the network.  This is a lot of sessions.  These sessions do not
   need to be fast.  They should have long keepalive timers.

8.  Segment Routing Procedures

   The devices will be segment-routing V6 (SRv6)
   [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header] capable.  When a device
   receives an Ipv6 packet with its own address in the destination IP
   address field in the IP address header and there is an SRv6 extension
   header with more segments, then the device will place the next
   segment into the destination IP address field and forward the packet
   to this destination.  If a device cannot replace the destination IP
   address from the SID list in the forwarding hardware, it can punt the
   packet to the control plane and do it there.

   The controller, knowing the topology, will be able to send a packet
   to any device in the network by building the appropriate SRv6 SID
   list.  Thus each device in the network does not need to store a route
   for every other device.

9.  Final Configuration

   Once the controller has learnt the complete network topology, or at
   least a large recognizable part of it, it can complete the
   configuration of the network.  This depends on the network.  The
   controller will be programmed with a description of the expected
   network and applicable constraints.  As discovery proceeds, the
   controller will try to match the discovered topology with the
   programmed description.  An example of a data center description is:
   "A number of pods.  Each pod consists of 384 TORs and 32 spines.
   Each TOR has 32 south facing ports and 32 north facing ports.  Each
   spine has 384 south facing ports and 192 north facing ports.  Super-
   spines connect the pods.  Some of the pods are DCI pods.  The devices
   need aggregatable addresses and BGP sessions."  The controller should
   be able to recognize all the switches, the servers and the DCI
   routers and match the discovered topology to the description.  It

Internet-Draft        MSDC Fabric Autoconfiguration        November 2018


   should then create configurations for all the devices and report
   inconsistencies.  How the controller does this is out of scope of
   this document.

   When a new device joins the network, the controller will detect it,
   because it will receive a DHCP request from it, relayed by its
   neighboring DHCP relay agent.

10.  Connecting a New Controller to a Network in Production

   A network can function without the controller present.  The
   controller is only needed to auto-configure the network when topology
   changes occur.  If a new controller is connected to a network that is
   already in production, then the controller has to discover the
   network before it can do anything else.  The controller connects to a
   switch using the link-local address.  The controller then uses
   Netconf to query the configuration of the switch.

11.  Multiple Controllers

   Because the controller need only be present to automate configuration
   changes, its absence is not likely to cause a network outage.  If a
   device interface is incorrectly connected, then it will just not come
   up.  Thus multiple controllers are not required for redundancy.  A
   single controller can be connected to multiple devices in the network
   in such a way that unreachability of large parts of the network is
   unlikely even with many failures within the network.

   Nonetheless, multiple controllers should be possible in a single
   network if they coordinate control amongst each other.  Such
   coordination is out of scope of this document.

12.  Security Considerations

   When the network to be configured is used as an underlay, then it is
   only used to connect tunnel endpoints together within the network.
   The network is not accessible from outside the network.  The network
   is accessible to directly connected devices.  An adversary can
   connect directly to a device in the network by being plugged into a
   port of that device.  This and all other threats listed in this
   section can be avoided by physical barriers to prevent access to the
   switching hardware.

   An adversary could inject or intercept packets into tunnels that are
   being carried by the fabric.  This can be avoided by using IPSEC
   tunnels for all payload traffic.





Heitz, et al.              Expires May 8, 2019                 [Page 10]

Internet-Draft        MSDC Fabric Autoconfiguration        November 2018


   An adversary could impersonate a controller and start a netconf
   session.  To avoid that, the real controller should use netconf over
   ssh to all devices.

   An adversary connected to a device in the network could send a DHCP
   SOLICIT message and get an IP address.  It can then start a BGP
   session with the device it connects to.  To avoid the BGP session,
   TCP-AO is recommended.

   An adversary connected to a device in the network could impersonate
   the controller and cause the device to request DHCP services from the
   adversary.  To avoid damage, all DHCP services other than what are
   required to implement the functionality of this document should be
   disabled.  DHCP Relay agents may use DHCP message authentication as
   specified in [RFC3315].  DHCP delayed authentication has been
   deprecated, because of operational complexity in managing shared
   secret keys.  Alternative methods using asymmetric keys are specified
   in [E-DHCP] and [S-DHCP6].

   An adversary that has access to the network could disrupt BGP
