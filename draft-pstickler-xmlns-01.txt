Internet-Draft           The 'xmlns:' URI Scheme              March 2002


1. Overview

   The 'xmlns:' URI scheme is intended to provide a simple but
   consistent means by which XML Namespaces [1] can be reified, and
   which also provides for the association of a namespace prefix with a
   given namespace.

   Examples:

      xmlns:rdf:http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns%23
      xmlns:rdfs:http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema%23
      xmlns:xsd:http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema%23
      xmlns:jdoe:mailto:john.doe@abc.com
      xmlns:*:http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns%23

   These examples are provided for illustrative purposes only and do not
   necessarily constitute actual URIs.  See the BNF definition below for
   an explicit definition of 'xmlns:' URI syntax.

2. BNF for the 'xmlns:' URI Scheme

   This is a BNF-like description of the 'xmlns:' Uniform Resource
   Identifier syntax, using the conventions of RFC 822[2], except that
   "|" is used to designate alternatives, and brackets [] are used
   around optional or repeated elements.  Briefly, literals are quoted
   with "", optional elements are enclosed in [brackets], and elements
   may be preceded with <n>* to designate n or more repetitions of the
   following element; n defaults to 0.

   This BNF description adopts sub-definitions defined in RFC 2396
   "Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax" [3] and the W3C
   Recommendation REC-xml-names "Namespaces in XML" [1] which are not
   repeated here.


   xmlns-URI      = "xmlns:" prefix ":" namespace
   prefix         = "*" | NCName
   namespace      = absoluteURI [ "%23" fragment ]

   NCName         = <as defined by W3C REC-xml-names>
   absoluteURI    = <as defined by RFC 2396>
   fragment       = <as defined by RFC 2396>


   An asterisk "*" in the prefix field of an 'xmlns:' URI indicates that
   no specific prefix is specified and the 'xmlns:' URI reifies the
   namespace alone.

   Note that the URI scheme prefix "xmlns:" is considered to be a valid
   URI denoting this URI scheme, though it is not itself a valid URI
   according to this URI scheme.

3. Security Considerations

   This document raises no known security issues.
