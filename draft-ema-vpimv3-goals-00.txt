     Internet Draft          VPIM V3 Goals          July 6, 1999
    
Abstract
This document describes the goals of the Voice Profile for Internet 
Messaging (VPIM), Version 3 work group and establishes a baseline of 
desired functionality against which proposed MIME profiles for 
Internet voice messaging can be judged. The goals for VPIM version 3 
are limited in scope and do not require any changes from the basic 
MIME flow defined by VPIM  version 2. The primary goal for this 
version is to support interoperability with desktop clients. Other 
goals for this version of VPIM include expanded interoperability with 
unified messaging systems, backward compatibility, and conformance to
Internet standards. This document does not include goals that were met
fully by VPIM version 2.

Different levels of desirability are indicated throughout the 
document.

1. Introduction
Until recently, voice mail and call answering services were 
implemented as stand-alone proprietary systems. Today, standards such 
as the Voice Profile for Internet Mail (VPIM) enable interoperability 
between such systems over the Internet. VPIM [VPIM1] describes a 
messaging profile that standardizes the exchange of voice mail over an 
IP messaging network using ESMTP [ESMTP] and MIME [MIME1]. VPIM 
Version 2 [VPIM2] provides interoperability between voice messaging 
services only. With the trend toward integration of voice mail and 
email through unified messaging (UM), it is now necessary to define a 
new version of VPIM that supports the needs of unified messaging 
systems and desktop applications. Because the number of desktop boxes 
is growing rapidly and will soon approach the number of desktop 
telephones, it is especially important to consider the requirements of
desktop email client applications.

This document defines the goals for VPIM version 3 [VPIM3]. This 
standard will support the interchange of voice messages between voice 
mail systems, unified messaging systems, email servers, and desktop 
client applications. It will also expand the offerings of service 
providers by facilitating access to voice mail from a web client.

1.1 Terminology used within this document
Within this document, different levels of desirability for a MIME 
profile for Internet voice messaging are indicated by different 
priorities, indicated in {braces}:
    {1} There is general agreement that this is a critical 
	characteristic of any definition of VPIM version 3.
    {2} Most believe that this is an important characteristic of VPIM 
	version 3.
    {3} There is general belief that this is a useful feature of VPIM 
	version 3., but that other factors might override; a definition 
	that does not provide this element is acceptable.

     Internet Draft          VPIM V3 Goals          July 6, 1999

In addition, the following terms are used:
	"service"      	An operational service offered by a service 
				provider.
	"application"  	A use of systems to perform a particular 
				function.
	"terminal"     	The endpoint of a communication application.
	"goal"        	An objective of the standardization process.

2. Goals for Voice Profile for Internet Messaging version 3
VPIM must define the MIME profile and discard rules which will be used
for the interchange of voice mail messages over the Internet, and 
must {1} meet the following goals:

2.1 Interoperability
Enhanced interoperability is the primary goal of VPIM version 3. The 
profile must {1} enable interoperability between voice mail systems, 
unified messaging systems, Internet email servers, and desktop client 
applications. Such interoperability will require {1} support for the 
new media-agnostic systems, which combine multiple media types into a 
single message, as well as support for legacy voice mail  and email 
systems. It will require {1} features to accommodate varying 
capabilities of the voice mail, unified messaging and email systems. 
It must also [1}, include new functionality to facilitate access to 
voice mail messages from desktop applications.

Specific goals for interoperability are detailed in section 3.0. 

2.2 Conformance to existing standards
It is the goal of VPIM version 3 to conform as closely as possible to 
existing standards while meeting the other goals defined in this 
document. 

- Restrictions: The profile should {2} impose as few restrictions as 
possible to existing Internet mail standards. In particular, it must 
{1} support all elements of RFC 822 [RFC822] except those that prevent 
the profile from meeting other VPIM version 3 goals.

- Additions: The profile should {2} make as few additions as possible 
to existing internet mail standards. It should also {2} adhere to 
existing desktop standards in desktop-related areas such as file 
extensions. If it is necessary to define new MIME types or sub-types, 
the VPIM version 3 work group should {2} propose terms that are 
already standard or in common use in the desktop environment.

2.3 Backward compatibility
It is a goal of this profile to assure backwards compatibility with 
VPIM version 2. Where this is not possible, it may be {2} necessary 
to clarify or revise version 2. VPIM version 3 must {1} comprise of 
superset of VPIM v2 features. It should {2} also provide define a 
minimal set of rules and status codes [CODES] for handling 
non-delivery of VPIM v3 messages.

     Internet Draft          VPIM V3 Goals          July 6, 1999

2.4 Robustness
VPIM v3 must {1} be usable in an environment in which there exist 
legacy gateways that do not understand MIME. Core features and 
critical data must {1} not be lost when messages pass through AMIS 
gateways [AMIS-A and AMIS-D]. VPIM version 3 should {2} allow 
interoperability with recipient devices and gateways which have 
limited buffering capabilities and cannot buffer all header 
information.

3. Interoperability goals for Voice Profile for Internet Messaging 
Version 3
To "support interoperability" means that a VPIM version 3 compliant 
sender attempting to send to a recipient will not fail because of 
incompatibility. It is essential {1} that VPIM version 3 support 
interoperability between most of the systems listed below, and 
desirable {3} to support all of them:
	- Desktop email client applications
	- VPIM version 2 and version 3 voice messaging systems
	- VPIM version 3 unified messaging systems
	- Traditional email servers

Overall interoperability requires interoperability for all of the 
VPIM elements: critical body parts must {1} be preserved, essential 
information must be provided in a form that is accessible by the 
users {1}, status codes must {1} be understood, and operations that 
are standard for each system should {2} be supported.

3.1 Interoperability with desktop email applications
Desktop email applications are typically text based. The ability to 
listen to, reply to, forward, and generate voice mail messages from 
a traditional desktop environment is a relatively new development. To 
accommodate current use and future developments in this area, VPIM 
version 3 must {1} provide features to support access to voice mail 
messages from the desktop and other email-reading devices. It would 
also be desirable {3} for it to support web access to voice mail from 
the desktop.

VPIM version 3 should not {2} require desktop email applications to 
possess a large amount of processing power, and a base level 
implementation must {1} interoperate, even if it does not offer 
complex processing. It is therefore necessary {1} for VPIM version 3 
to support a variety of codecs  that meet differing processor and 
memory constraints. Codecs included in the VPIM version 3 
specification should {2} meet the following criteria:
	- Availability on desktops: Codecs should {2} be available on 
	most platforms (Windows, UNIX, Mac)
	- Multiple codecs: VPIM version 3 must {1} allow for range of 
	codecs from low bit rate/high complexity to high bit rate/low 
	complexity.  Clients need choice in codec based on resources 
	available (bandwidth and CPU).  One codec is not suitable for 
	all devices. 



    Di Silvestro, Laile       Expires 7/6/99         [Page 5]

     Internet Draft          VPIM V3 Goals          July 6, 1999

	- Limited number of codecs: VPIM version 3 should {2} not 
	specify more than 4 or 5 codecs or implementation may be 
	delayed.
	-Source code availability
	-Decoding complexity: All codecs must {1} be low complexity to 
	decode
	-Encoding complexity: Some of the codecs must {1} be low 
	complexity to encode.  
	- Bit rate: VPIM version 3 must {1} specify some codecs with 
	low bit rate for devices (i.e., wireless) that do not have much 
	space/bandwidth.
	-Voice Over IP support: VPIM version 3 should {2} specify at 
	least one codec that supports Voice over IP implementations.

Most desktop email applications and web clients are not capable of 
playing raw audio. To support "out-of-the box" playing of voice mail 
content, VPIM v3 must {1} support wav encapsulation of audio. To 
enable future support of other formats, VPIM version 3 should {2} 
provide identification of the codec used without requiring 
interpretation of an audio format. VPIM v3 may {3} allow audio 
encodings and formats that are not identified in the VPIM version 3 
specification to support environments in which the sender is aware of 
the optimal encoding and format for the recipient.

Performance and bandwidth issues make it desireable {3} to support 
streaming of VPIM version 3 audio to the desktop. VPIM version 3 
may {3} explicitely support formats other than raw audio and wav to 
facilitate streaming. 
 
Because most email readers are text/html based and because many 
devices are not capable of recording audio content, VPIM v3 must {1} 
allow  inclusion of text body parts in a voice message. VPIM version 3
should {2} not explicitly prohibit other media types, as long as 
critical content is identified and minimal discard rules are 
specified.

To support devices that are not capable of playing audio, VPIM 3  should 
{2} define an optional informational text body part
describing the content of the message and indicating how the audio 
content can be accessed.

It is also a desktop requirement {1} to support attachments of any 
media type. VPIM version 3 must {1} specify discard rules for cases 
in which recipient can't render the attachments.

3.2 Interoperability with VPIM version 2 and version 3 voice 
messaging systems
Voice messaging systems are generally implemented as special-purpose 
machines that interface to a telephone switch and provide call 
answering and voice messaging services. VPIM version 2 was designed 
to support interoperability between such systems and remains the best 
messaging profile for the purpose.


    Di Silvestro, Laile       Expires 7/6/99         [Page 6]

     Internet Draft          VPIM V3 Goals          July 6, 1999

To support interoperability between VPIM voice messaging systems and 
other compliant systems, VPIM version 3 must {1} have a simple 
minimum set of required features that will guarantee interoperability,
as well as provision for additional functionality that may be 
supported by more capable systems. Support for this additional 
functionality requires {1} a mechanism for identifying essential 
content and status codes indicating that a message could not be 
delivered due to capability differences. It should {2} also include a
minimum set of discard rules.

The requirement for interoperability with VPIM version 2 voice 
messaging systems has strong implications for the specification of 
standard audio encoding and format. Interoperability must {1} be able
to depend on the receiving system supporting the VPIM version 2 
32KADPCM codec [ADPCM and G726] , and must not {1} depend on the 
receiving system supporting any additional VPIM version 3 codecs or 
audio formats.

To ensure interoperability between VPIM version 2 and version 3 
systems, it may [3] be desirable to revise the VPIM version 2 
specification to include new status codes and discard rules.

3.3 Interoperability with VPIM version 3 unified messaging systems
Unified messaging solutions typically leverage common store, 
directory, and transport layers to provide greater interoperability 
and accessibility to a variety of media content. They support creation
of and access to voicemail, email, and fax messages from a single user
interface.
 
Most unified messaging systems preserve the notion of a primary media
type with multiple message components that convey essential 
information. Because unified messaging clients have varying 
capabilities, these components may have a different media type than 
the message. It is also common for unified messaging systems to 
permit forwarding and replying to messages of one type as an 
attachment to a message of another type.

To accommodate the common functionality of unified messaging systems, 
VPIM version 3 must {1} support the inclusion of body parts of a type 
other than the primary content type. It must {1} also support the 
embedding of VPIM messages as attachments to messages of another type 
(such as multipart/mixed), as well as the embedding of messages of 
another type as attachments to VPIM messages.

To provide interoperability with systems that cannot handle a 
particular content type, VPIM version 3 must {1} provide a mechanism 
for identifying essential body parts and should {2} define media 
specific status codes and strings to handle non-delivery of essential 
body parts.

     Internet Draft          VPIM V3 Goals          July 6, 1999

3.4 Interoperability with traditional email servers
VPIM version 3 must {1} interoperate consistently with the current 
Internet mail environment. If VPIM version 3 messages arrive in 
users' mailboxes, it is required {1} that the standard interoperate 
successfully with common user practices for mail messages: storing 
them in databases, retransmission, forwarding, creation of mail 
digests, and replying to messages using non-audio equipment.
