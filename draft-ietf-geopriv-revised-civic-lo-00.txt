Abstract

   This document defines an XML format for the representation of civic
   location.  This format is designed for use with PIDF Location Object
   (PIDF-LO) documents.  The format is based on the civic address
   definition in PIDF-LO, but adds several new elements based on the
   civic types defined for DHCP, and adds a hierarchy to address complex
   road identity schemes.  The format also includes support for the xml:
   lang language tag and restricts the types of elements where
   appropriate.

Internet-Draft              Revised Civic LO               December 2005


1.  Introduction

   Since the publication of the original PIDF-LO civic specification, in
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-pidf-lo], it has been found that the specification
   is lacking a number of additional parameters that can be used to more
   precisely specify a civic location.  These additional parameters have
   been largely captured in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-dhcp-civil].

   This document revises the GEOPRIV civic form to include the
   additional civic parameters captured in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-dhcp-
   civil].  The document also introduces a hierarchical structure for
   thoroughfare (road) identification which is employed in some
   countries.  New elements are defined to allow for even more precision
   in specifying a civic location.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The term "thoroughfare" is used in this document to describe a road
   or part of a road or other access route along which a final point is
   identified.  This is consistent with the definition used in [S42].

3.  Changes from PIDF-LO

3.1.  Additional Civic Address Types

   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-dhcp-civil] provides a full set of parameters that
   may used to describe a civic location.  Specifically [I-D.ietf-
   geopriv-dhcp-civil] lists several civic address types (CAtypes) that
   require support in the formal PIDF-LO definition that are not in
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-pidf-lo].  Additional CAtypes are registered in
   Section 7.3.

   These changes include and new elements that are required to support
   more complex structures for naming street addresses, this is
   described in more detail in Section 3.2.

   Building: The "building" (BLD) conveys the name of a single building
      if the street address includes more than one building or the
      building name is helpful in identifying the location.  (For
      example, on university campuses, the house number is often not
      displayed on buildings, while the building name is prominently
      shown.)

   Unit: The "unit" (UNIT) contains the name or number of a part of a
      structure where there are separate administrative units, owners or
      tenants, such as separate companies or families who occupy that
      structure.  Common examples include suite or apartment
      designations.

   Room: A "room" (ROOM) is the smallest identifiable subdivision of a
      structure.

   Seat: The "seat" element (SEAT) describes a single place where a
      person might sit.  Common examples include a seat in a theatre and
      a cubicle in a cube farm.

   Place type: The "type of place" element (PLC) describes the type of
      place described by the civic coordinates.  For example, it
      describes whether it is a home, office, street or other public
      space.  The values are drawn from the items in the location types
      registry [I-D.ietf-geopriv-location-types-registry].  This
      information makes it easy, for example, for the DHCP client to
      then populate the presence information.

   Post office box: The "post office box" element (POBOX) describes a
      container, such as a pigeon hole, at a central mailing location,
      where mail is held.

   Additional code: The "additional code" item (ADDCODE) provides an
      additional, country-specific code identifying the location.  For
      example, for Japan, it contains the Japan Industry Standard (JIS)
      address code.  The JIS address code provides a unique address
      inside of Japan, down to the level of indicating the floor of the
      building.

   Primary Road Name: The "primary road name" item (RD) is the name
      given to the root road or street associated with the address.  In
      many cases this will the name of the road or street on which an
      office or house exists, in some cases it will be the name of road
      or street from which more granular information stems.  In most
      countries, this field should be used in preference to the "A6"
      element, which was previously used for street information.

Internet-Draft              Revised Civic LO               December 2005


   Road Section: The "road section" item (RDSEC) is an identifier that
      represents a specific section or stretch of a primary road.  This
      is a new thoroughfare element and is useful where a primary road
      reuses street numbering, or branch street names and there is no
      other way to identify that this has occurred, such as a change in
      municipality or suburb.

   Branch Road Name: The "branch road name" item (RDBR) represents the
      name or identifier of a road/street that intersects or is
      associated with a primary road.  The road branch is a new
      thoroughfare element and is envisaged being used where branch
      roads along a primary road reuse names and there is no other way,
      other than the road section (RDSEC) identifier, to discern a
      difference between them, such as a change in municipality or
      suburb.

   Sub-Branch Road Name: The "sub-branch road name" item (RDSUBBR)
      represents the name or identifier of a road/street that intersects
      or is associated with a branch road (RDBR).  The road sub-branch
      is a new thoroughfare element and is envisaged being used where
      sub-branch roads reuse names and there is no way, other than the
      road section (RDSEC) identifier, to discern a difference between
      them, such as a change in municipality or suburb.

3.2.  New Thoroughfare Elements

   In some countries a thoroughfare can be broken up into sections, and
   it is not uncommon for street numbers to be repeated between
   sections.  A road section identifier is required to ensure that an
   address is unique.  For example, "West Alice Parade" has 5 sections,
   each numbered from 1; unless the section is specified "7 West Alice
   Parade" could exist in 5 different places.  The "RDSEC" element is
   used to specify the section.

   Minor streets can share the same name, so that they can only be
   distinguished by the major thoroughfare with which they intersect.
   For example, both "West Alice Parade, Section 3" and "Bob Street"
   could both be interested by a "Carol Lane".  The "RDBR" element is
   used to specify a road branch where the name of the branch does not
   uniquely identify the road.  Road branches MAY also be used where a
   major thoroughfare is split into sections.

   Similar to the way that a road branch is associated with a road, a
   road sub-branch is associated with a road branch.  The "RDSUBBR"
   element is used to identify road sub-branches.

   The "A6" element is retained for use in those countries that require
   this level of detail.  Where "A6" was previously used for street

   names, it MUST NOT be used, the "RD" element MUST be used for
   thoroughfare data.

   The following example figure shows a fictional arrangement of roads
   where these new thoroughfare elements are applicable.

                                           |               ||

3.2.1.  Street Numbering

   The introduction of new thoroughfare elements affects the
   interpretation of several of more specific civic address data.  In
   particular, street numbering (the "HNO" element) applies to the most
   specific road element specified.  That is, the first specified
   element from: "RDSUBBR", "RDBR", "RDSEC", or "RD".

3.2.2.  Directionals and other Qualifiers

   The "PRD", "POD" and "STS" elements always apply to the value of the
   "RD" element only.  If road branches or sub-branches require street
   suffixes or qualifiers, they MUST be included in the "RDBR" or
   "RDSUBBR" element text.

   In PIDF-LO [I-D.ietf-geopriv-pidf-lo], examples and descriptions for
   the "PRD" and "POD" elements focussed on these qualifiers being
   directionals, for example North, South etc.  This derives from their
   use in North America, where the name is derived from (pre-directional
   and post-directional respectively).  However in quite a number of
   cities and countries around the world a street prefix may be
   something other than a directional, for example "Little" or "Lower".
   The Universal Postal Union (UPU) standard [S42] refers to these items
   as "thoroughfare qualifiers" and allows any value for these fields.
   This specification extends the allowed values for the "PRD" and "POD"
   elements to include any value.

   To avoid confusion it is RECOMMENDED that where the "PRD" and "POD"
   elements are used to represent something other than a directional
   that the values be explicit such as "Little" and not an abbreviation

   such as "Lt".

3.3.  Country Element

   The "country" element differs from that defined in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-
   pidf-lo] in that it now restricts the value space of the element to
   two upper case characters, which more closely matches the definition
   in [ISO.3166.1988].

3.4.  Languages and Scripts

   The XML schema defined for civic addresses allows for the addition of
   the "xml:lang" attribute to all elements except "country" and "PLC",
   which both contain enumerated values.

   The "script" field defined in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-dhcp-civil] is
   omitted in favour of using the "xml:lang" attribute.

   It is RECOMMENDED that each "civicAddress" element use one language
   only, or a combination of languages that is consistent.  Where a
   civic location is represented in multiple languages multiple
   "civicAddress" elements SHOULD be included in the PIDF-LO document.

3.5.  Whitespace

   The XML schema [W3C.REC-xmlschema-2-20041028] defined in Section 4
   uses a base type of "token" instead of "string" as used in [I-D.ietf-
   geopriv-pidf-lo].

   The "token" type ensures that whitespace within instance documents is
   normalized and collapsed before being passed to a processor.  This
   ensures that the following fragments are considered equivalent by XML
   processors:

   <A1>New South Wales</A1>

   <A1>New
     South Wales</A1>

   <A1>
     New  South
     Wales      </A1>

   Whitespace may still be included in values by using character
   references, such as "&#x20;".
