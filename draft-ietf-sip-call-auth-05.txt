Abstract 
    
   This document describes the need for QoS and media authorization and 
   defines a SIP extension that can be used to integrate QoS admission 
   control with call signaling and help guard against denial of service 
   attacks. The use of this extension is only applicable in administrative 
   domains, or among federations of administrative domains with previously 
   agreed-upon policies, where both the SIP proxy authorizing the QoS, and 
   the policy control of the underlying network providing the QoS belong to 
   that administrative domain or federation of domains.

1. Scope of Applicability 
    
   This document defines a SIP extension that can be used to integrate QoS 
   admission control with call signaling and help guard against denial of 
   service attacks. The use of this extension is only applicable in 
   administrative domains, or among federations of administrative domains 
   with previously agreed-upon policies, where both the SIP proxy 
   authorizing the QoS, and the policy control of the underlying network 
   providing the QoS belong to that administrative domain or federation of 
   domains. Furthermore, the mechanism is generally incompatible with end-
   to-end encryption of message bodies that describe media sessions. 
    
   This is in contrast with general Internet principles which separate data 
   transport from applications, and the solution described in this document 
   is thus not applicable to the Internet at large. Despite these 
   limitations, there are sufficiently useful specialized deployments that 
   meet the assumptions described above, and can accept the limitations that 
   result, to warrant publication of this mechanism.  An example deployment 
   would be a closed network which emulates a traditional circuit switched 
   telephone network. 
    
2. Conventions used in this document 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2]. 
    
3. Background and Motivation 
    
   Current IP telephony systems assume a perfect world in which there is 
   either unlimited amount of bandwidth or network layer Quality of Service 
   (QoS) is provided without any kind of policy control. However the reality 
   is that end-to-end bandwidth is not unlimited and uncontrolled access to 
   QoS in general is unlikely. The primary reason for this is that QoS 
   provides preferential treatment of one flow at the expense of another. 
   Consequently, it is important to have policy control over whether a given 
   flow should have access to QoS. This will not only enable fairness in 
   general, but can also prevent denial of service attacks.

                SIP Extensions for Media Authorization        May 2002 
 
    
   In this document, we are concerned with providing QoS for media streams 
   established via the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [3]. We assume an 
   architecture that integrates call signaling with media authorization as 
   illustrated in the Figure below. The solid lines (A and B) show 
   interfaces whereas the dotted line (C) illustrates the QoS enabled media 
   flow:

                    |               v

                |  UA  |........|router|......       
                +------+        +------+              
                      
    
                         Figure 1 - Basic Architecture 
    
    
   In this architecture, we assume an untrusted SIP UA connected to a QoS 
   enabled network with an edge router acting as a Policy Enforcement Point 
   (PEP) [6]. We furthermore assume that a SIP UA, that wishes to obtain 
   QoS, initiates sessions through a proxy which can interface with the QoS 
   policy control for the data network being used. We will refer to such a 
   proxy as a QoS enabled proxy. We assume that the SIP UA needs to present 
   an authorization token to the network in order to obtain Quality of 
   Service (C). The SIP UA obtains this authorization token via SIP (A) from 
   the QoS enabled proxy by means of an extension SIP header defined in this 
   document. The proxy in turn communicates either directly with the edge 
   router or with a Policy Decision Point (PDP - not shown) [6] in order to 
   obtain a suitable authorization token for the UA.  
    
   Examples of access data networks where such a QoS enabled proxy could be 
   used include DOCSIS based cable networks and 3rd generation (3G) wireless 
   networks. 
    
4. Overview 
    
   A session, that needs to obtain QoS for the media streams in accordance 
   with our basic architecture described above is performed as follows.  
    
   The SIP UA sends an INVITE to the QoS enabled proxy which for each 
   resulting dialog includes a media authorization token in all unreliable 
   provisional responses (except 100), the first reliable 1xx or 2xx 
   response, and all retransmissions of that reliable response for the

   dialog. When the UA requests QoS, it includes the media authorization 
   token with the resource reservation.  
    
   A SIP UA may also receive an INVITE from its QoS enabled proxy which 
   includes a media authorization token. In that case, when the UA requests 
   QoS, it includes the media authorization token with the resource 
   reservation. 
    
5. Changes to SIP to Support Media Authorization 
    
   This document defines a private SIP header extension to support a media 
   authorization scheme. In this architecture a QoS enabled SIP proxy 
   supplies the UA with an authorization token which is to be used in QoS 
   requests. The extension defined allows network QoS resources to be 
   authorized by the QoS enabled SIP proxy. 
    
5.1 SIP Header Extension 
    
   A new P-Media-Authorization general header field is defined. The Media-
   Auth header field contains a media authorization token which is to be 
   included in subsequent resource reservations for the media flows 
   associated with the session. The media authorization token is used for 
   authorizing QoS for the media stream(s). The P-Media-Authorization header 
   field is described by the following ABNF [4]: 
    
        P-Media-Authorization       = "P-Media-Authorization" HCOLON  
                                        P-Media-Authorization-Token  
                                        *(COMMA P-Media-Authorization-Token) 
         
        P-Media-Authorization-Token = 1*HEXDIG 
    
    
   Table 1 below is an extension of tables 2 and 3 in [3] for the new header 
   field defined here: 
    
                            Where  proxy  ACK  BYE  CAN  INV  OPT  REG 
    P-Media-Authorization            ad    -    -    -    o    -    - 
    
                      Table 1: Summary of header fields. 
    
   The P-Media-Authorization header field can be used with the INVITE method 
   as well as any response to it. Extension methods MAY define usage of the 
   header field as well. 
    
5.2 SIP Procedures 
    
   This section defines the SIP [3] procedures for usage in media 
   authorization compatible systems from the point of view of authorizing 
   QoS.

                SIP Extensions for Media Authorization        May 2002 
 
5.2.1 User Agent Client (UAC) 
    
   The initial SIP INVITE message, mid-call messages that result in network 
   QoS resource changes, and mid-call changes in call destination should be 
   authorized. These SIP messages are sent through the QoS enabled proxies 
   to receive this authorization. In order to authorize QoS, the QoS enabled 
   SIP proxy MAY need to inspect message bodies that describe the media 
   streams, e.g. SDP, and hence such message bodies SHOULD NOT be encrypted 
   end-to-end.  
    
   The P-Media-Authorization-Token, which is contained in the P-Media-
   Authorization header, is included for each dialog in all unreliable 
   provisional responses (except 100), the first reliable 1xx or 2xx 
   response, and all retransmissions of that reliable response for the 
   dialog sent by the QoS enabled SIP proxy to the UAC.  
    
   The UAC SHOULD use all the P-Media-Authorization-Token(s) from the most 
   recent request/response that contained the P-Media-Authorization header 
   when requesting QoS for the associated media stream(s). This applies both 
   to the initial and subsequent refresh reservation messages. The UAC 
   converts the string of hex digits into binary, and utilizes the result as 
   a Policy-Element as defined in RFC 2750 [5] (including Length and P-
   Type). This Policy-Element would typically contain the authorizing entity 
   and credentials, and be used in an RSVP request for media data stream QoS 
   resources. 
    
5.2.2 User Agent Server (UAS) 
    
   The User Agent Server receives the P-Media-Authorization-Token in an 
   INVITE (or other) message from the QoS enabled SIP proxy. If the response 
   contains a message body that describes media streams for which the UA 
   desires QoS, said message body SHOULD NOT be end-to-end encrypted. 
    
   The UAS SHOULD use all the P-Media-Authorization-Token(s) from the most 
   recent request/response that contained the P-Media-Authorization header 
   when requesting QoS for the associated media stream(s). This applies both 
   to the initial and subsequent refresh reservation messages. The UAS 
   converts the string of hex digits into binary, and utilizes the result as 
   a Policy-Element as defined in RFC 2750 [5] (including Length and P-
   Type). This Policy-Element would typically contain the authorizing entity 
   and credentials, and be used in an RSVP request for media data stream 
   resources. 
    
5.2.3 Originating Proxy (OP) 
    
   When the originating QoS enabled proxy (OP) receives an INVITE (or other) 
   message from the UAC, the proxy authenticates the caller, and verifies 
   that the caller is authorized to receive QoS.  
    
   In cooperation with an originating Policy Decision Point (PDP-o), the OP 
   obtains and/or generates a media authorization token that contains 
   sufficient information for the UAC to get the authorized QoS for the 
   media streams. The media authorization token is formatted as a Policy-
   Element, as defined in RFC 2750 [5], and then converted to a string of

                SIP Extensions for Media Authorization        May 2002 
 
   hex digits to form a P-Media-Authorization-Token. The proxy MAY inspect 
   message bodies that describe the media streams, e.g. SDP, in both 
   requests and responses in order to decide what QoS to authorize. 
    
   For each dialog that results from the INVITE (or other) message received 
   from the UAC, the originating proxy MUST add a P-Media-Authorization 
   header with the P-Media-Authorization-Token in all unreliable provisional 
   responses (except 100), the first reliable 1xx or 2xx response, and all 
   retransmissions of that reliable response the proxy sends to the UAC, if 
   that response may result in network QoS changes. A response with an SDP 
   may result in such changes.  
    
5.2.4 Destination Proxy (DP) 
    
   The Destination QoS Enabled Proxy (DP) verifies that the called party is 
   authorized to receive QoS.  
    
   In cooperation with a terminating Policy Decision Point (PDP-t), the DP 
   obtains and/or generates a media authorization token that contains 
   sufficient information for the UAS to get the authorized QoS for the 
   media streams.  The media authorization token is formatted as a Policy-
   Element, as defined in RFC 2750 [5], and then converted to a string of 
   hex digits to form a P-Media-Authorization-Token. The proxy MAY inspect 
   message bodies that describe the media streams, e.g. SDP, in both 
   requests and responses in order to decide what QoS to authorize. 
    
   The Destination Proxy MUST add the P-Media-Authorization header with the 
   P-Media-Authorization-Token in the INVITE (or other) request that it 
   sends to the UAS, if that message may result in network QoS changes. A 
   message with an SDP body may result in such changes.  
    
6. Examples 
    
6.1 Requesting Bandwidth via RSVP messaging 
    
   Below we provide an example for how the P-Media-Authorization header 
   field can be used in conjunction with the Resource Reservation Protocol 
   (RSVP) [7]. The example assumes that resource management is integrated 
   with SIP signaling and therefore utilizes the 183 Session Progress 
   provisional response, which contains an SDP description of the media 
   flow. 
    
6.1.1 User Agent Client Side 
    
   Figure 2 presents a high-level overview of a basic call flow with media 
   authorization from the viewpoint of the UAC. Some policy interactions 
   have been omitted for brevity.  
    
   When a user goes off-hook and dials a telephone number, the UAC collects 
   the dialed digits and sends the initial (1)INVITE message to the 
   originating SIP proxy.

                SIP Extensions for Media Authorization        May 2002 
 
   The originating SIP proxy (OP) authenticates the user/UAC and forwards 
   the (2)INVITE message to the proper SIP proxy. 
    
   Assuming the call is not forwarded, the terminating end-point sends a 
   (3)183 response to the initial INVITE via OP. Included in this response 
   is an indication of the negotiated bandwidth requirement for the 
   connection (in the form of an SDP description [8]). 
    
   When OP receives the (3)183, it has sufficient information regarding the 
   end-points, bandwidth and characteristics of the media exchange. It 
   initiates a Policy-Setup message to PDP-o, (4)AuthProfile.  
    
   The PDP-o stores the authorized media description in its local store, 
   generates an authorization token that points to this description, and 
   returns the authorization token to the OP, (5)AuthToken.

   The OP includes the authorization token in the P-Media-Authorization 
   header extension of the (6)183 message. 
    
   Upon receipt of the (6)183 message, the UAC stores the media 
   authorization token from the P-Media-Authorization header. 
    
   Before sending any media, the UAC requests QoS by sending an (7)RSVP-PATH 
   message which includes the previously stored P-Media-Authorization-Token 
   as a Policy-Element.  
    
   ER-o, upon reception of the (7)RSVP-PATH message checks the authorization 
   through a PDP-o COPS message exchange, (8)REQ. PDP-o checks the 
   authorization using the stored authorized media description that was 
   linked to the authorization token it returned to OP. If authorization is 
   successful, PDP-o returns an "install" Decision, (9)DEC.  
    
   ER-o checks the admissibility for the request and if admission succeeds, 
   it forwards the (10)RSVP-PATH message. 
    
   Once UAC receives the (11)RSVP-PATH message from UAS it sends the 
   (12)RSVP-RESV message to reserve the network resources. 
    
   ER-o, upon receiving the (12)RSVP-RESV message checks the authorization 
   through a PDP-o COPS message exchange, (13)REQ. PDP-o checks the 
   authorization using the stored authorized media description that was 
   linked to the authorization token it returned to OP. If authorization is 
   successful PDP-o returns an "install" Decision, (14)DEC.  
    
   ER-o checks the admissibility for the request and if admission succeeds, 
   it forwards the (15)RSVP-RESV message.

6.1.2 User Agent Server Side 
    
   Figure 3 presents a high-level overview of a call flow with media 
   authorization from the viewpoint of the UAS. Some policy interactions 
   have been omitted for brevity. 
    
   Since the destination SIP proxy (DP) has sufficient information regarding 
   the endpoints, bandwidth and characteristics of the media exchange, it 
   initiates a Policy-Setup message to the terminating Policy Decision Point 
   (PDP-t) on receipt of the (1)INVITE.

   PDP-t stores the authorized media description in its local store, 
   generates an authorization token that points to this description, and 
   returns the authorization token to DP. The token is placed in the 
   (4)INVITE message and forwarded to the UAS. 
    
   Assuming that the call is not forwarded, the UAS sends a (5)183 response 
   to the initial INVITE message, which is forwarded back to UAC. At the 
   same time, the UAS sends an (7)RSVP-PATH message which includes the 
   previously stored P-Media-Authorization-Token as a Policy-Element.  
    
   ER-t, upon receiving the (7)RSVP-PATH message checks the authorization 
   through a PDP-t COPS message exchange. PDP-t checks the authorization 
   using the stored authorized media description that was linked to the

   authorization token it returned to DP. If authorization is successful 
   PDP-t returns an "install" Decision, (9)DEC.  
    
   ER-t checks the admissibility for the call and if admission succeeds, it 
   forwards the (10)RSVP-PATH message. 
    
   Once the UAS receives the (11)RSVP-PATH message, it sends (12)RSVP-RESV 
   message to reserve the network resources. 
    
   ER-t, upon reception of the (12)RSVP-RESV message, checks the 
   authorization through a PDP-t COPS message exchange. PDP-t checks the 
   authorization using the stored authorized media description that was 
   linked to the authorization token that it returned to DP. If 
   authorization is successful PDP-t returns an "install" Decision, (14)DEC.  
    
   ER-t checks the admissibility for the call and if admission succeeds, it 
   forwards the (15)RSVP-RESV message. 
    
   Upon receiving the (16)RSVP-RESV message, network resources have been 
   reserved in both directions.  
    
7. Advantages of the Proposed Approach 
    
   The use of media authorization makes it possible to control the usage of 
   network resources. This in turn makes IP Telephony more robust against 
   denial of service attacks and various kinds of service frauds. By using 
   the authorization capability, the number of flows, and the amount of 
   network resources reserved can be controlled thereby making the IP 
   Telephony system dependable in the presence of scarce resources. 
    
8. Security Considerations 
    
   In order to control access to QoS, a QoS enabled proxy may want to 
   authenticate the UA before providing it with a media authorization token. 
   Both the method and policy associated with such authentication is outside 
   the scope of this document, however it could for example be done by using 
   standard SIP authentication mechanisms as described in [3].  
    
   Media authorization tokens sent in the P-Media-Authorization header from 
   a QoS enabled proxy to a UA MUST be protected from eavesdropping and 
   tampering. This can for example be done through a mechanism such as IPSec 
   or TLS. However, this will only provide hop-by-hop security. If there is 
   one or more intermediaries, e.g. proxies, between the UA and the QoS 
   enabled proxy, these intermediaries will have access to the P-Media-
   Authorization header field value thereby compromising confidentiality and 
   integrity. This will enable both theft-of-service and denial-of-service 
   attacks against the UA. Consequently, the P-Media-Authorization header 
   field MUST NOT be available to any untrusted intermediary in clear or 
   without integrity protection. There is currently no mechanism defined in 
   SIP that would satisfy these requirements. Until such a mechanism 
   exists, proxies MUST NOT send P-Media-Authorization headers through 
   untrusted intermediaries.

   QoS enabled proxies may need to inspect message bodies describing media 
   streams, e.g. SDP. Consequently, such message bodies SHOULD NOT be 
   encrypted. This will in turn prevent end-to-end confidentiality of said 
   message bodies which lowers the overall security possible.  
    
9. IANA Considerations 
    
   This document defines a new private SIP header for media authorization 
   which is "P-Media-Authorization".
