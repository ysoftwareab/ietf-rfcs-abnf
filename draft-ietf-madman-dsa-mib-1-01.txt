Abstract

   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB). It defines the MIB for monitoring Directory System
   Agents(DSA), a component of the OSI Directory. This MIB will be  used
   in  conjunction  with the APPLICATION-MIB for monitoring DSAs.

1.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework.

   The major components of the SNMPv2 Network Management framework  are
   described in the documents listed below.


         o RFC 1902 [1] defines the Structure of Management Information
           (SMI), the mechanisms used for describing and naming objects
           for the purpose of management.

         o STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] defines MIB-II, the core set of managed
           objects (MO) for the Internet suite of protocols.

         o RFC 1905 [3] defines the protocol used for network access to
           managed objects.

   The framework is adaptable/extensible by defining new MIBs to suit
   the requirements of specific applications/protocols/situations.

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, the
   MIB.  Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract
   Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.  In particular, each
   object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, which is an
   administratively assigned name.  The object type together with an
   object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation
   of the object.  For human convenience, often a textual string, termed
   the descriptor, is used to refer to the object type.

   2.  MIB Model for  DSA  Management.

   A DSA-manager may wish to monitor  several  aspects of  the
   operational DSA. He/she may want to know the process related aspects-
   the resource utilization of the operational DSA;  the  network
   service related aspects e.g. inbound-associations, outbound-
   associations, operational status,  and finally the information
   specific to the DSA application- its operations and performance.

   The MIB defined in this document covers the  portion  which is
   specific  to the DSA-application. The network service related part of
   the MIB, and the host-resources related part  of the  MIB ,  as  well
   other  parts of interest to a Manager monitoring the DSA-application,
   are covered in separate  documents  [5][6].

   3.  The DSA functions and operations.

   The Directory System Agent [DSA], a component of the OSI-
   Directory[4][8], is an application process. It provides access to the
   Directory Information Base [DIB] to Directory User Agents [DUA]
   and/or other DSAs.  Functionally , a User [ DUA ] and the Directory
   are bound together for a period of time at an access point to the
   Directory [DSA].  A DSA may use information stored in its local
   database or interact with (chain the request to) other DSAs to
   service requirements. Alternatively, a DSA may return a reference to
   another DSA.

   The local database of a DSA consists of the part of the DIT that is
   mastered by the DSA, the part of the DIT for which it keeps slave
   copies and cached information that is gathered during the operation
   of the DSA.

   The specific operations carried out by the DSA are : Read, Compare,
   AddEntry, ModifyEntry, ModifyRDN, RemoveEntry, List, Search.  There
   is also the special operation Abandon. In response to requests
   results and/or errors are returned by the DSA.

4.  MIB design.

   The basic principle has been to keep the MIB as simple as  possible.
   The Managed objects included in the MIB are divided into three
   tables- dsaOpsTable, dsaEntryTable and dsaIntTable.

      - The dsaOpsTable  provides  summary statistics on the accesses,
        operations and errors.

      - The dsaEntriesTable  provides  summary statistics on the entries
        held by the DSA and on cache performance.

      - The dsaIntTable  provides some useful information on the
        interaction of the monitored DSA with peer DSAs.

   There   are  references   to   the   Directory  itself  for   static
   information  pertaining  to the DSA. These references are in the form
   of "Directory Distinguished Name" [7] of the corresponding object. It
   is intended  that  DSA management applications will use these
   references to obtain  further  related information on the objects of
   interest.
