Abstract

   This document describes LEMONADE profile bis.  It contains pointers
   or mention to all the features that are normatively part of LEMONADE
   profile bis.

   This document describes a profile (a set of required extensions,

   restrictions and usage modes) of the IMAP and mail submission
   protocols.  This profile allows clients (especially those that are
   constrained in memory, bandwidth, processing power, or other areas)
   to efficiently use IMAP and Submission to access and submit mail.
   This includes the ability to forward received mail without needing to
   download and upload the mail, to optimize submission and to
   efficiently resynchronize in case of loss of connectivity with the
   server.

   The Lemonade profile relies upon extensions to IMAP and Mail
   Submission protocols; specifically URLAUTH and CATENATE IMAP protocol
   ([18]) extensions and BURL extension to the SUBMIT protocol (SUBMIT).

   It provides also extensions to provide support for realizationz of
   OMA mobile email enabler (MEM) ([16] and [9]) using Internet Mail
   protocols defined by the IETF.

Conventions used in this document

   In examples, "M:", "I:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client
   messaging user agent, IMAP e-mail server and SMTP submit server
   respectively.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [5].

   All examples in this document are optimized for Lemonade use and
   might not represent examples of proper protocol usage for a general
   use Submit/IMAP client.  In particular examples assume that Lemonade
   Submit and IMAP servers support all Lemonade extensions described in
   this document, so they don't show how to deal with absence of an
   extension.

1.  Introduction

   Lemonade provides enhancements to Internet email to support diverse
   service environments.

   It is based on LEMONADE profile [17].

   This document describes the lemonade profile-bis that includes:

   o  "Forward without download" that describes exchanges between
      Lemonade clients and servers to allow to submit new email messages
      incorporating content which resides on locations external to the
      client.

   o  Quick mailbox resynchronization using [33].

   o  Several IMAP and SMTP extensions that allow saving bandwidth
      and/or number of round trips required to send/receive data.

   o  Extensions to provide support to realizations of OMA mobile email
      enabler (MEM) using Internet Mail protocols defined by the IETF.
      Many of these protocols have been enhanced by the LEMONADE work
      group for use in the mobile environment and are summarized in the
      LEMONADE profile [17].

   This document also supports the requirements captured in OMA MEM
   Requirement document [16] and mechanisms of the OMA MEM Architecture
   [9], following the LEMONADE point of view described in the  OMA MEM
   realization internet draft [35].

   This document contains the current view of the work.  It refers to
   stable specifications and work in progress.  As the work progress, it
   is expected that this document will evolve and be updated
   accordingly.

   <Editor's note: As a result some of the statements about some
   specification may not yet supported by the references.  When it is
   the case, these specifications are expected to be be updated.>

   <Editor's note: Caveats to be removed and / or updated when work
   stabilizes.>

   Also, it is to be noted that this document solely describes
   normatively the LEMONADE profile bis.  It discusses LEMONADE
   understanding of the work in progress at OMA MEM ([16] and [9] but
   does not provide a normative reading of these documents.  Readers
   MUST refer to the open mobiel alliance web site for normative
   references on the Mobile Email Enabler (OMA MEM).  LEMONADE assumes

   that the LEMONADE profile bis can be used as basis for an OMA
   technical specification of a realization based on LEMONADE of the OMA
   MEM enabler.

2.  Forward without download

2.1.  Motivations

   The advent of client/server email using the [18], [20] and [22]
   protocols has changed what formerly were local disk operations to
   become repetitive network data transmissions.

   Lemonade "forward without download" makes use of the [14] SUBMIT
   extension to enable access to external sources during the submission
   of a message.  In combination with the IMAP [13] extension, inclusion
   of message parts or even entire messages from the IMAP mail store is
   possible with a minimal trust relationship between the IMAP and SMTP
   SUBMIT servers.

   Lemonade "forward without download" has the advantage of maintaining
   one submission protocol, and thus avoids the risk of having multiple
   parallel and possibly divergent mechanisms for submission.  The
   client can use Submit/SMTP [22] extensions without these being added
   to IMAP.  Furthermore, by keeping the details of message submission
   in the SMTP SUBMIT server, Lemonade "forward without download" can
   work with other message retrieval protocols such as POP, NNTP, or
   whatever else may be designed in the future.

2.2.  Message Sending Overview

   The act of sending an email message can be thought of as involving
   multiple steps: initiation of a new draft, draft editing, message
   assembly, and message submission.

   Initiation of a new draft and draft editing takes place in the MUA.
   Frequently, users choose to save more complex messages on an [18]
   server (via the APPEND command with the \Draft flag) for later recall
   by the MUA and resumption of the editing process.

   Message assembly is the process of producing a complete message from
   the final revision of the draft and external sources.  At assembly
   time, external data is retrieved and inserted in the message.

   Message submission is the process of inserting the assembled message
   into the [20] infrastructure, typically using the [22] protocol.

2.3.  Traditional Strategy

   Traditionally, messages are initiated, edited, and assembled entirely
   within an MUA, although drafts may be saved to an [18] server and
   later retrieved from the server.  The completed text is then
   transmitted to an MSA for delivery.



Maes, et al.            Expires September 5, 2006               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft            LEMONADE profile bis                March 2006


   There is often no clear boundary between the editing and assembly
   process.  If a message is forwarded, its content is often retrieved
   immediately and inserted into the message text.  Similarly, when
   external content is inserted or attached, the content is usually
   retrieved immediately and made part of the draft.

   As a consequence, each save of a draft and subsequent retrieve of the
   draft transmits that entire (possibly large) content, as does message
   submission.

   In the past, this was not much of a problem, because drafts, external
   data, and the message submission mechanism were typically located on
   the same system as the MUA.  The most common problem was running out
   of disk quota.

2.4.  Step by step description

   The model distinguishes between a Messaging User Agent (MUA), an
   IMAPv4Rev1 Server ([18]) and a SMTP submit server ([22]), as
   illustrated in Figure 1.

                                              +--------------+

   Figure 1: Lemonade "forward without download"

   Lemonade "forward without download" allows a Messaging User Agent to
   compose and forward an e-mail combining fragments that are located in
   an IMAP server, without having to download these fragments to the
   client.

   There are two ways to perform "forward without download" based on
   where the message assembly takes place.  The first uses extended
   APPEND command [15] to edit a draft message in the message store and
   cause the message assembly on the IMAP server.  The second uses a
   succession of BURL and BDAT commands to submit and assemble through
   concatenation, message data from the client and external data fetched
   from the provided URL.  The two subsequent sections provide step-by-
   step instructions on how "forward without download" is achieved.

2.4.1.  Message assembly using IMAP CATENATE extension

   In the [14]/[15] variant of the Lemonade "forward without download"
   strategy, messages are initially composed and edited within an MUA.
   The [15] extension to [18] is then used to create the messages on the
   IMAP server by transmitting new text and assembling them.  The [12]
   IMAP extension is used by the client in order to learn the UID of the
   created messages.  Finally a [13] format URL is given to a [22]
   server for submission using the [14] extension.

   The flow involved to support such a use case consists of:

   M: {to I -- Optional} The client connects to the IMAP server,
   optionally starts TLS (if data confidentiality is required),
   authenticates, opens a mailbox ("INBOX" in the example below) and
   fetches body structures (See [18]).

   Example:

            M: A0051 UID FETCH 25627 (UID BODYSTRUCTURE)
            I: * 161 FETCH (UID 25627 BODYSTRUCTURE (("TEXT" "PLAIN"
               ("CHARSET" "US-ASCII") NIL NIL "7BIT" 1152 23)(
               "TEXT" "PLAIN" ("CHARSET" "US-ASCII" "NAME"
               "trip.txt")
               "<960723163407.20117h@washington.example.com>"
               "Your trip details" "BASE64" 4554 73) "MIXED"))
            I: A0051 OK completed

   M: {to I} The client invokes CATENATE (See [15] for details of the
   semantics and steps) -- this allows the MUA to create messages on the
   IMAP server using new data combined with one or more message parts
   already present on the IMAP server.

   Note that the example for this step doesn't use the LITERAL+ [4]
   extension.  Without LITERAL+ the new message is constructed using 3
   round-trips.  If LITERAL+ is used, the new message can be constructed
   using one round-trip.

   Note that if the IMAP server doesn't send CAPABILITY response code in

   server may omit the STARTTLS command before issuing the LOGIN
   command.

2.4.2.  Message assembly using SMTP CHUNKING and BURL extensions

   In the [14]/[8] variant of the Lemonade "forward without download"
   strategy, messages are initially composed and edited within an MUA.
   During submission [22], BURL [14] and BDAT [8] commands are used to
   create the messages from multiple parts.  New body parts are supplied
   using BDAT commands, while existing body parts are referenced using
   [13] format URLs in BURL commands.

   The flow involved to support such a use case consists of:
   M: {to I -- Optional} The client connects to the IMAP server,
   optionally starts TLS (if data confidentiality is required),
   authenticates, opens a mailbox ("INBOX" in the example below) and
   fetches body structures (See [18]).

   Example:

            M: A0051 UID FETCH 25627 (UID BODYSTRUCTURE)
            I: * 161 FETCH (UID 25627 BODYSTRUCTURE (("TEXT" "PLAIN"
               ("CHARSET" "US-ASCII") NIL NIL "7BIT" 1152 23)(
               "TEXT" "PLAIN" ("CHARSET" "US-ASCII" "NAME"
               "trip.txt")
               "<960723163407.20117h@washington.example.com>"
               "Your trip details" "BASE64" 4554 73) "MIXED"))
            I: A0051 OK completed

   M: {to I} The client uses GENURLAUTH command to request URLAUTH URLs
   (See [13]) referencing pieces of the message to be assembled.
   I: {to M} The IMAP server returns URLAUTH URLs suitable for later
   retrieval with URLFETCH (See [13] for details of the semantics and
   steps).

         M: A0054 GENURLAUTH "imap://bob.ar@example.org/INBOX;
            UIDVALIDITY=385759045/;UID=25627;Section=2.MIME;

   M: {to I} The client marks the forwarded message on the IMAP server.

         M: A0053 UID STORE 25627 +FLAGS.SILENT ($Forwarded)
         I: A0053 OK STORE completed

   Note: the UID STORE command shown above will only work if the marked
   message is in the currently selected mailbox.  This command can be
   omitted.  The $Forwarded IMAP keyword is described in Section 2.8.

2.5.  Normative statements related to forward without download

   Lemonade compliant IMAP servers MUST support IMAPv4Rev1 [18],
   CATENATE [15], UIDPLUS [12] and URLAUTH [13].  This support MUST be
   declared via CAPABILITY [18].

   Lemonade compliant submit servers MUST support the BURL [14],
   8BITMIME [1], BINARYMIME [8] and CHUNKING [8].  This support MUST be
   declared via EHLO [20].  BURL MUST support URLAUTH type URLs [13],
   and thus MUST advertise the "imap" option following the BURL EHLO
   keyword (See [14] for more details).

   Additional normative statements are provided in other sections.

2.6.  Security Considerations for pawn-tickets.

   The so-called "pawn-ticket" authorization mechanism uses a URI, which
   contains its own authorization credentials using [13].  The advantage
   of this mechanism is that the SMTP submit [22] server cannot access
   any data on the [18] server without a "pawn- ticket" created by the
   client.

   The "pawn-ticket" grants access only to the specific data that the
   SMTP submit [22] server is authorized to access, can be revoked by
   the client, and can have a time-limited validity.

2.7.  The fcc problem

   The "fcc problem" refers to delivering a copy of a message to a "file
   carbon copy" recipient.  By far, the most common case of fcc is a
   client leaving a copy of outgoing mail in a "Sent Mail" or "Outbox"
   mailbox.

   In the traditional strategy, the MUA duplicates the effort spent in
   transmitting to the MSA by writing the message to the fcc destination
   in a separate step.  This may be a write to a local disk file or an
   APPEND to a mailbox on an IMAP server.  The latter is one of the "
   repetitive network data transmissions" which represents the "problem"
   aspect of the "fcc problem".

   The [15] extension to [18] can be used to address the fcc problem.
   The final message is constructed in the mailbox designed for outgoing
   mail.  Note that the [15] extension can only create a single message
   and only on the server which stages the outgoing message for
   submission.  Additional copies of the message can be created on the
   same server using one or more COPY commands.

2.8.  Registration of $Forwarded IMAP keyword

   The $Forwarded IMAP keyword is used by several IMAP clients to
   specify that the message was resent to another email address,
   embedded within or attached to a new message.  A mail client sets
   this keyword when it successfully forwards the message to another
   email address.  Typical usage of this keyword is to show a different
   (or additional) icon for a message that has been forwarded.  Once set
   the flag SHOULD NOT be cleared.

   Lemonade compliant servers MUST be able to store the $Forwarded
   keyword.  They MUST preserve it on the COPY operation.  The servers
   MUST support the SEARCH KEYWORD $Forwarded.

   LEMONADE compliant mail submission servers are expected to implement
   the following set of SMTP extensions to make message submission
   efficient.

   Lemonade clients SHOULD take advantage of these features.

3.1.  Pipelining

   Mobile clients regularly use networks with a relatively high latency.
   Avoidance of round-trips within a transaction has a great advantage
   for the reduction in both bandwidth and total transaction time.  For
   this reason LEMONADE compliant mail submission servers MUST support
   the SMTP Service Extensions for Command Pipelining [6].

   Clients SHOULD pipeline SMTP commands when possible.

3.2.  DSN Support

   LEMONADE compliant mail submission servers MUST support SMTP service
   extensions for delivery status notifications [11].

3.3.  Message size declaration

   LEMONADE compliant mail submission servers MUST support the SMTP
   Service Extension for Message Size Declaration [2].

   LEMONADE compliant mail submission servers MUST ("expand") all BURL
   parts before enforcing a message size limit.

   A LEMONADE compliant client SHOULD use message size declaration.  In
   particular it SHOULD NOT send a message to a mail submission server,
   if the client knows that the message exceeds the maximal message size
   advertised by the submission server.

3.4.  Enhanced status code Support

   LEMONADE compliant mail submission servers MUST support SMTP Service
   Extension for Returning Enhanced Error Codes [3].

3.5.  TLS

   LEMONADE Compliant mail submission servers MUST support SMTP Service
   Extension for Secure SMTP over TLS [24].

4.  Quick resynchronization

   LEMONADE Compliant IMAP servers MUST support the CONDSTORE [33]
   extension.  It allows a client to quickly resynchronize any mailbox
   by asking the server to return all flag changes that have occurred
   since the last known mailbox synchronization mark.

   [47] shows how to perform quick mailbox resynchronization.

5.  Additional IMAP extensions

   Lemonade compliant IMAP servers MUST support the NAMESPACE [10]
   extension.  The extension allows clients to discover shared mailboxes
   and mailboxes belonging to other users.

   Lemonade compliant IMAP servers MUST support the LITERAL+ [4]
   extension.  The extension allows clients to save a round trip each
   time a non-synchronizing literal is sent.

   Lemonade compliant IMAP servers MUST support the IDLE [28] extension.
   The extension allows clients to receive instant notifications about
   changes in the selected mailbox, without needing to poll for changes.

   LEMONADE Compliant IMAP servers MUST support IMAP over TLS [18] as
   required by [18].

7.  OMA MEM Requirement document

   The OMA MEM activity has collected a set of use cases and derived
   requirements for a mobile email enabler (MEM). the resulting work is
   summarized in OMA MEM Requirement document [16].  Some requirements
   relates to email protocols, some involve other OMA technologies
   outside the scope of IETF and some relate to implementations and
   normative interoperability statements for clients and servers.

8.  OMA MEM Architecture

   The OMA MEM activity has derived a logical architecture from the
   requirements and use cases described in [16].  The logical
   architecture, its elements and interfaces and the notations that it
   uses can be found in [9].

9.  OMA MEM Deployment Issues

   The OMA MEM Architecture document [9] further identifies deployment
   models.

   Certain of these deployment models are not what IETF has
   conventionally modeled.  They require special attention to end-to-end
   security aspects and may warrant introduction of additional security
   measures (e.g. object level encryption).

10.  OMA MEM proxy

   The OMA MEM Architecture document [9] identifies OMA MEM server
   proxies as server components that may be deployed ahead of firewalls
   to facilitate traversal of firewalls.

   Both IMAP and SMTP generally are compatible with proxies between the
   client and the server.  Such proxies may disrupt end-to-end
   encryption, with the transport-level encryption ending at the proxy
   and re-generating from the proxy to the server.  Again this may
   require additional security measures like object level encryption.

11.  IETF LEMONADE Architecture

   This section gives a brief introduction to the LEMONADE Architecture.

   The IETF LEMONADE activity has derived a LEMONADE profile [17] with
   the logical architecture represented in Figure 15, where arrows
   indicate content flows.

   o  Lemonade profile message store / Submit server protocols (URLAUTH)
      (see [17] and [13]).

   o  Outband server to client notifications relying on external
      notification mechanisms (and notification protocols) that may be
      out of scope of the LEMONADE profile bis.

   o  A LEMONADE aware MUA (Mail User Agent).  While use of outband
      notification is described in the LEMONADE profile bis, support for
      the underlying notifications mechanisms/protocols is out of scope
      of the LEMONADE specifications.

   Further details on the IETF email protocol stack and architecture can
   be found in [21]

   Note that in Figure 15 the IMAP server and Submit server are
   represented connected to MTAs (Mail Transfer Agents) via ESMTP [19].
   This is not really essential.  It could as well be X.400 so long as
   the message in the store is in the internet form.

   OMA MEM identifies other functionalities.  These are considered as
   out of scope of the LEMONADE work and will need to be specified by
   OMA MEM.

12.  LEMONADE profile bis logical architecture

   This section details the LEMONADE profile bis logical architecture.
   Thsi architecture is also expected to support the OMA MEM logical
   Architecture.

   Figure 16: Mapping of LEMONADE profile bis logical architecture  onto

   As described in Section 11, the LEMONADE profile bis assumes LEMONADE
   profile bis compliant IMAP stores and Submit servers.  Because the

Internet-Draft            LEMONADE profile bis                March 2006


   LEMONADE profile bis extends the IMAP store and the submit server,
   the mobile enablement of email provided by the LEMONADE profile bis
   is directly provided in these server.  Mapped to OMA MEM logical
   architecture, for the case considered and specified by the LEMONADE
   profile bis, the MEM server and email server logically combined.
   They are however split into distinct LEMONADE message store and
   LEMONADE submit server.  The OMA MEM interfaces ME-2 ([9]) consists
   of two interfaces ME-2a and ME-2b associated respectively to IMAP
   extended according to the LEMONADE profile bis and SUBMIT extended
   according to the LEMONADE profile bis.

   The MUA is part of the MEM client.

   External notifications mechanism can be part of the other OMA enabler
   specified by OMA (or other activities).

12.2.  LEMONADE realization of OMA MEM with non-LEMONADE compliant
       servers

   The OMA MEM activity is not limited to enabling Lemonade compliant
   servers.  It explicitly identifies the need to support other
   backends.

12.2.1.  LEMONADE realization of OMA MEM with non-LEMONADE enhanced IMAP
         servers

   Figure 17 illustrates the case of IMAP servers that are not (yet)
   LEMONADE compliant / enhanced with LEMONADE.  In such case, the I2
   interface between the MEM server components and the IMAP store and
   submit server are IMAP and SUBMIT.

13.  Filters and server to client notifications and LEMONADE

   OMA MEM RD [16] and AD [9] emphasize the need to provide mechanisms
   for server to client notifications of email events and filtering.
   Figure 19 illustrates how notification and filterings are introduced
   in LEMONADE profile bis.

   Figure 19: Filtering mechanism defined in LEMONADE architecture

   In Figure 19, four categories of filters are defined:

   o  AF: Administrative Filters - Set up by email service provider.  AF
      are typically not configured by the user and set to apply policies
      content filtering, virus protection, spam filtering etc...

   o  DF: Deposit Filters - Filters that are executed on deposit of new
      email messages.  They can be defined as SIEVE filters [25].  They
      can include vacation notices.

   o  VF: View Filters - Filters that define which emails are visible to
      the MUA.  View filters can be defined as virtual folders [26] as
      described in [26] and [37].

   o  NF: Notification Filters - Filters that define for what email
      server event an outband notification is sent to the client.

   The filters are manageable from the MUA:

   o  NF and DF: via SIEVE Management protocol [41]

   o  VF: via virtual folder mechanisms as discussed in [26] and [37]

14.  LEMONADE Profile bis features

   <Editor's note: This section will be expended with subsection
   discussing each topic with some details or examples.>

   The LEMONADE Profile bis provides normative support for the technical
   features identified within scope of IETF LEMONADE work in the OMA MEM
   realization internet draft [35].

   <Editor's note: This text will be updated when all features are
   appropriately addressed. [35] will be maintained as a working
   document to remain synchronized with the LEMONADE prfile bis to
   ensure supporting all committed aspects.>

   The following is a list of features that will be normatively
   described: <Editor's note: The features are currently introduced by
   reference to documents that are work in progress and may still be
   individual drafts.  They are expected to become WG drafts and RFCs.
   References will be updated and text provided to explain the normative
   usage in LEMONADE profile bis.>

   o  LEMONADE profile [17] features, evolved to include capabilities to
      edit on MUA and send differences to server even for address
      fields..

   o  Notifications (server to client) as discussed in [37].

   o  Filters as discussed in [37], [26], [39], [25] and [36].  Events
      that can be bound to notifications are described in [29].  Filter
      remote management are discussed in [37] and [26].  For NF, it MAY
      rely on [41].

   o  Virtual folders as discussed in [26]

   o  Media conversion as discussed in [31].  Streamed media conversion
      is still under consideration.

   o  Quick reconnect as discussed in [34]

   o  Compression as discussed in [38]

   o  Intermediaries as discussed in [49].  Best practices are discussed
      in [46].  Lemonade protocols MAY also follow [45].

   o  Proxies and other intermediaries that provide protocol support
      disrupt conventional IETF security models and require object level
      encryption as discussed in [40]. [37] further discusses the use
      for notification encryption.

15.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations on Lemonade "forward without download" are
   discussed throughout Section 2.  Additional security considerations
   can be found in [18] and other documents describing other SMTP and
   IMAP extensions comprising the Lemonade Profile.

   Note that the mandatory to implement authentication mechanism for
   SMTP submission is described in [22].  The mandatory to implement
   authentication mechanism for IMAP is described in [18].

15.1.  Confidentiality Protection of Submitted Messages

   When clients submit new messages, link protection such as TLS guards
   against an eavesdropper seeing the contents of the submitted message.
   It's worth noting, however, that even if TLS is not used, the
   security risks are no worse if BURL is used to reference the text
   than if the text is submitted directly.  If BURL is not used, an
   eavesdropper gains access to the full text of the message.  If BURL
   is used, the eavesdropper may or may not be able to gain such access,
   depending on the form of BURL used.  For example, some forms restrict
   use of the URL to an entity authorized as a submission server or a
   specific user.

15.2.  TLS

   When LEMONADE clients use the BURL extension to mail submission, an
   extension that requires sending a URLAUTH token to the mail
   submission server, such a token should be protected from interception
   to avoid a replay attack that may disclose the contents of the
   message to an attacker.  TLS based encryption of the mail submission
   path will provide protection against this attack.

   LEMONADE clients SHOULD use TLS protected IMAP and mail submission
   channels when using BURL-based message submission to protect the
   URLAUTH token from interception.

   LEMONADE compliant mail submission servers SHOULD use TLS protected
   IMAP connections when fetching message content using the URLAUTH
   token provided by the LEMONADE client.

   When a client uses SMTP STARTTLS to send a BURL command which
   references non-public information, there is a user expectation that
   the entire message content will be treated confidentially.  To meet
   this expectation, the message submission server should use STARTTLS
   or a mechanism providing equivalent data confidentiality when
   fetching the content referenced by that URL.

15.3.  Additional extensions and deployment models

   This specification provides no additional security measures beyond
   those in the referenced Internet Mail and LEMONADE documents.

   We note however the security risks associated to:

   o  Outband notifications

   o  Server configuration by client

   o  Client configuration by server

   o  Presence of proxy servers

   o  Presence of servers as intermediaries

   o  In general the deployment models considered by OMA MEM that are
      not conventional IETF deployment models.

   o  Measures to address the need to traverse firewalls and mobile
      network intermediaries.

      *  (a) The signaling between the Media Server and the client to
         initiate and control streaming of the media

      *  (b) The actual media streaming

   o  This could involve SIP, RTP, RTSP, ... <Editor's note: References
      will be added later after details are agreed upon.>

   o  <Editor's note: Open issue: Could IMPA store issue the signalling
      (e.g.  SIP third party call control) or does it have to be solely
      between client and media server>
