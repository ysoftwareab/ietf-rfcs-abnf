     Internet Draft           VPIM Directory            December 1, 2000


  1. Abstract

  2. Scope

  2.1 Design Goals

     The VPIM directory Schema (VPIMDIR) is accessed from outside the
     enterprise or service provider domain using the recipients telephone
     number.

  2.2 Performance Constraints

     Once the identity of the VPIM directory server is known, the email
     address, capabilities, and spoken name confirmation information can be
     retreived. This query is expected to use LDAP, a connection-oriented
     protocol.  The protocol transaction includes multiple packet round-
     trip to execute the query and retreival and is considered to be the
     most at-risk element of the infrastructure.  Further, retreival of the
     confirmation information may require the return of a spoken name
     segment up to 20kbytes (5 seconds at 4kbytes/second).  Over a
     sufficiently engineered Internet connection, a 1250 ms response time
     is believed to be achievable over the Internet at large.

  2.3 Scaling Constraints

     A service provider's namespace is expected to include several million-
     subscriber entries based on the VPIM inter-domain address form:
     telephone number@domain_name.  A large corporation may have a hundred-
     thousand entries.  It is expected that there will be a single public
     address validation service for a given service providers network.  It
     is believed that existing directory technology will provide sufficient
     transaction throughput within the required latency requirements to
     address this need.  The only fundamental new requirement this
     application imposes on directory servers beyond similar existing
     services is the ability to return the recipients spoken name, a record
     an order of magnitude larger than common textual elements.
     Preliminary investigation suggests that storage and retreival of
     spoken name will not add appreciable latency, however it will add to
     the need for storage capacity.

  2.4 Reliability Constraints

     DNS provides well-documented redundancy and load-ballancing
     capabilities for the VPIMDIR.  These capabilities appear to meet the
     unstated reliability requirements of this service.



  3. The VPIM Directory Schema

     VPIMUser OBJECT-CLASS ::= {
                STRUCTURAL
                SUBCLASS OF top
                MUST CONTAIN

     Vaudreuil, Parsons       Expires 5/1/00                    [Page 4]



     Internet Draft           VPIM Directory            December 1, 2000


                      (vPIMrfc822Mailbox,
                       telephoneNumber )
                MAY CONTAIN
                     (vPIMSpokenName $
                     vPIMsupportedUABehaviors $
                     vPIMSupportedEncodingTypes $
                     vPIMTextName $
                     extendedAbsenceStatus $
                     vPIMMaxMessageSize $
                      subMailbox)
                ID }

     The vPIMUser is a structural object indexed by the telephoneNumber.

     When present, the vPIMUser may contain information useful to validate
     that the dialed telephone number corresponds to the intended
     recipient.  This object may further provide capabilities information
     and mailbox status information useful to guide composition by the
     sending user and to set delivery expectations at sending time.

  3.1 TelephoneNumber

     The normal search is for the E164 form of the telephone number,
     including any sub-addressing information provided by the sender.

     telephoneNumber ATTRIBUTE ::= {
               WITH SYNTAX    caseIgnoreIA5StringSyntax
                    (SIZE (1 .. 20)) -- from RFC 1274
               ID ?? }

  3.2 vPIMrfc822Mailbox

     The attribute vPIMrfc822Mailbox stores the inter-domain SMTP address
     of the voice mailbox associated with a given telephone number.  It is
     defined as a distinct attribute to distinguish it from the
     rfc822Mailbox attribute that may be used for other purposes. Although
     it would be preferable to define vPIMrfc822Mailbox as a subtype of
     rfc822Mailbox, it is defined here as an entirely new attribute because
     some directory implementations do not support sub-typing.

     ASN.1 definition:

     vPIMrfc822Mailbox ATTRIBUTE ::= {
               WITH SYNTAX    caseIgnoreIA5StringSyntax
                    (SIZE (1 .. 64)) -- from RFC 1274
               ID ?? }

     BNF definition:

     (2.16.840.1.113694.1.2.1.1.2 NAME 'vPIMrfc822Mailbox'
                  EQUALITY 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.109.114.2
                  SYNTAX   '1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.26 {256}')

     Internet Draft           VPIM Directory            December 1, 2000


  3.3 vPIMSpokenName

     The vPIMSpokenName attribute is an octet string and should be encoded
     in 32 kbit/s ADPCM exactly as defined by [32KADPCM]. vPIMSpokenName
     shall contain the spoken name of the user in the voice of the user.
     The length of the spoken name segment must not exceed 5 seconds.
     Private or additional encoding types are outside the scope of this
     version.

     The ASN.1 definition for X.500 implementations is:

          vPIMSpokenName ATTRIBUTE ::= {
               WITH SYNTAX              OCTET STRING
                                   (SIZE (1..ub-vpim-at-vPIMSpokenName)
               EQUALITY MATCHING RULE   octetStringMatch
               ID                  id-vpim-at-vPIMSpokenName }
          ub-vpim-at-vPIMSpokenName          INTEGER ::= 4000

          The BNF definition for use with LDAP is:

               (2.16.840.1.113694.1.2.1.1.3 NAME 'vPIMSpokenName'
                EQUAILTY 2.5.13.17
                SYNTAX '1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.40 {4000}')

  3.4 vPIMTextName

     The text name is designed to be consistent with the text name
     databases used for calling name delivery service of caller ID and when
     cached may be used for address-by-name functions within a telephone
     user interface.

     vPIMTextName ATTRIBUTE ::= {
               WITH SYNTAX  IA5String
                    (SIZE (1..20))
               ID ?? }

     OPEN ISSUE The character set of this attribute is not yet determined.

  3.5 vPIMSupportedEncodingTypes

     The vPIMSupportedEncodingTypes attribute indicates the type(s) of
     encodings that can be received at the address specified in
     vPIMrfc822Mailbox.

     The ASN.1 definition for X.500 implementations is:

          vPIMSupportedEncodingTypes ATTRIBUTE ::= {
               WITH SYNTAX              DirectoryString
               EQUALITY MATCHING RULE   caseIgnoreMatch
               ID             id-vpim-at-vPIMSupportedEncodingTypes }

          The BNF definition of vPIMSupportedEncodingTypes for use with
     LDAP is:

     Internet Draft           VPIM Directory            December 1, 2000


         (2.16.840.1.113694.1.2.1.1.4 NAME
                   'vPIMSupportedEncodingTypes'
                EQUALITY      2.5.13.2
                SYNTAX   '1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15')

     The allowable values of DirectoryString for this version of the schema
     are:

                 audio/32KADPCM
                  image/tiff

     Additional publicly defined extensions, registered with IANA as
     specified in RFC 2048, may be used.  Non-standard and private encoding
     types must be indicated by prepending the new type name with either
     "X-" or "x-".

     The existance of the value "image/tiff" indicates that simple-mode fax
     is enabled for the mailbox whose address is defined by the
     vPIMrfc822mailbox attribute.

  3.6 extendedAbsenceStatus

     It is common to have an attribute to indicate to the subscriber
     whether the recipient is likely to check messages in the near future.
     This feature called "extended absence" provides an advisory message at
     sending time.  It is similar in concept to "vacation notices" common
     for textual email but has it's own cultural and operational nuances.

     extendedAbsenceStatus ATTRIBUTE ::= {
             WITH SYNTAX  IA5string
                    (SIZE (1..10))
                  ID ?? }

     The three values defined are:

                 "Off", "On", "MsgBlocked"

     "Off" indicates that the recipient either does not support extended
     absence or has not set such an indicator. "Off" if the default
     condition if this attribute is not returned.

     "On" indicates that the recipient has set an extended absence
     indicator, but the mailbox is still accepting messages for review at
     an unspecified future time.

     "MsgBlocked" indicates that the recipient has set an extended absence
     indicator and the mailbox is temporarly configured to reject incoming
     messages.  Messages should not be sent to the recipient if this value
     is returned in the extendedAbsenceStatus attribute.

  3.7 supportedUABehaviors

     Internet mail does not provide facilities for the sender to know
     whether the recipient supports a number of optional features that can

     Vaudreuil, Parsons       Expires 5/1/00                    [Page 7]



     Internet Draft           VPIM Directory            December 1, 2000


     be requested or indicated in the RFC822 headers.  This attribute
     provides a list of the attributes considered optional by VPIM and
     other vendor-specific attributes that may be supported by the
     recipient.  If this attribute is not supported, only those attributes
     listed as manditory in VPIM are assumed to be supported.  Undisclosed
     behaviors may be indicated in the RFC822 message, however there is no
     assurance by the receiving system of their support.

     VPIMSupportedUABehaviors ATTRIBUTE ::= {
               WITH SYNTAX  IA5String
                    (SIZE (1..30))
               MULTIVALUE
               ID ?? }

     The following behaviors:

                 MessageDispositionNotication

     The presense of the MessageDispositionNotification value indicates
     that the recipient will send a MDN in response to an MDN request.

     These may be further extended without standardization to include
     proprietary user interface functional extensions.  These proprietary
     extension values must be prefixed with an X.

  3.8 Maximum Message Size

     At the time of composition, the message can be checked for acceptable
     length using the maximum message size attribute.  Maximum message size
     is an attribute usually configured by policy of the receiving system,
     typically in units of minutes.  While ESMTP provides a mechanism at
     the transport layer to determine if a message is too long, that is an
     unreliable guide to the composer when multiple encodings, multiple
     media, or variable bit-rate encodings are supported.

     The ASN.1 definition for X.500 implementations is:

          vPIMMaxMessageSize ATTRIBUTE ::= {
               WITH SYNTAX              NumericString
               EQUALITY MATCHING RULE   numericStringMatch
               ID                  id-vpim-at-vPIMMaxMessageSize}

     The BNF definition for use with LDAP is:

     (2.16.840.1.113694.1.2.1.1.5 NAME 'vPIMMaxMessageSize'
                EQUALITY      2.5.13.8
                  SYNTAX   '1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.36')

  3.9 subMailbox

     This attribute indicates the presence of sub-mailboxes for the queried
     telephone number.  This information may be used to provide a post-dial
     sub-addressing menu to the sender.

     Internet Draft           VPIM Directory            December 1, 2000


     subMailbox ATTRIBUTE ::= {
             WITH SYNTAX  IA5String
                    (SIZE (1..9999))
             MULTIVALUE
                  ID ?? }

     The allowable values include a list of submailbox numbers with a
     numeric range of 1-9999.  The user interface may use this information
     to prompt the sender to select a sub-mailbox.  Spoken names associated
     with each sub-mailbox may be individually retrieved by subsequent
     queries to the recipient's VPIMDIR service.

  4. Security Considerations

     The following are known security issues taken into consideration in
     the definition of this directory service.

     1) Service provider customer information is very sensitive, especially
     in this time of local phone competition.  Service providers require
     the maximum flexibility to protect this data.  Because of the dense
     nature of telephone number assignments, this data is subject to "go
     fish" queries via repeated LDAP queries to determine a complete list
     of current or active messaging subscribers.  To reduce the value of
     this retreived data, service providers may limit disclosure of data
     useful for telemarketing such as the textual name and disclose only
     information useful to the sender such as the recipients spoken name, a
     data element much harder to auto-process.

     2) Service providers operate in a regulated environment where certian
     information about a subscriber must not be disclosed.  Voice Messaging
     is subject to caller-ID blocking restrictions, restrictions enforced
     in the telephony network.  No such protection is available on the
     Internet.  The protection of this data is essential, but is up to the
     individual service providers to appropriately limit dislosure of this
     information.

     This experimental directory builds upon the earlier work of Carl
     Malamud and Marshall Rose in thier TPC.INT remote printing experiment
     and the work lead by Anne Brown as part of the EMA voice messaging
     committee's directory effort.

     Bernhard Elliot working with the TMIA has provided most of the
     organizational impetus to get this project moving, a substantial task
     given the sometimes slow and bureaucratic nature of the voice mail
     industry and regulatory environment.
