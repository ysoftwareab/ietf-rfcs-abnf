Abstract

   This document describes requirements for how IPv6 address prefixes
   should be delegated to an IPv6 subscriber's network (or "site").

1. Introduction

   With the deployment of IPv6 [2], several Internet Service Providers
   are ready to offer IPv6 access to the public.  In conjunction with
   widely deployed "always on" media as ADSL, and the expectation that
   customers will be assigned a /48 IPv6 address prefix, an efficient
   mechanism for delegating address prefixes to the customers sites is
   needed.  The delegation mechanism will be intended to automate the

   process of informing the customer's networking equipment of the
   prefixes to be used at the customer's site.

   This document clarifies the requirements for IPv6 address prefix
   delegation from the ISP to the site.

2. Requirements

   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in RFC2119 [1].

3. Scenario and terminology

   The following figure illustrates a likely example for the
   organization of a network providing subscription IPv6 service:

                                                     /------\
                                                    /        \
                                                   +          |
                                                  / \        /
        +---------------+              +--------+/   \------/
        |ISP Edge Router|Point-to-point|Customer+
        |               +--------------+ Router |  Customer networks
        |     (PE)      |     link     | (CPE)  +
        +---------------+              +--------+\   /------\
                                                  \ /        \
                                                   +          |
                                                    \        /
                                                     \------/

   Illustration of ISP-customer network architecture

   Terminology:

   PE Provider edge device; the device at which the link to the customer
      site is terminated

   CPE Customer provided equipment; the device at the customer site at
      which the link to the ISP is terminated


4. Requirements for Prefix Delegation

   The purpose of the prefix delegation mechanism is to communicate
   prefixes to the CPE automatically.

Internet-Draft    Requirements for IPv6 prefix delegation       Feb 2003


4.1 Number and Length of Delegated Prefixed

   The prefix delegation mechanism SHOULD allow for delegation of
   prefixes of length /48, /64 and other lengths, and SHOULD allow for
   delegation of more than one prefix to the customer.

4.2 Use of Delegated Prefixes in Customer Network

   The prefix delegation mechanism MUST NOT prohibit or inhibit the
   assignment of longer prefixes, created from the delegated prefixes,
   to links within the customer network.  It is not a requirement that
   the prefix delegation mechanism provide for the reporting of prefix
   delegation within the customer network back to the ISP.

4.3 Automated Assignment

   The prefix delegation mechanism SHOULD allow for long-lived pre-
   assignment of one or more prefix(es) to a customer and for 
   automated, possibly short-lived assignment of a prefix to a customer
   on demand.

4.4 Policy-based Assignment

   The prefix delegation mechanism SHOULD allow for the use of policy in
   assigning prefixes to a customer.  For example, the customer's
   identity and type of subscribed service may be used to determine the
   address block from which the customer's prefix is selected, and the
   length of the prefix assigned to the customer.

4.5 Security and Authentication

   The prefix delegation mechanism MUST provide for reliable
   authentication of the identity of the customer to which the prefixes
   are to be assigned, and MUST provide for reliable, secure
   transmission of the delegated prefixes to the customer.

4.6 Accounting

   The prefix delegation mechanism MUST allow for the ISP to provide
   accounting information about delegated prefixes.

4.7 Layer 2 Considerations

   The method SHOULD work on any layer 2 technologies.  In other words,
   it should be layer 2 technology independent.  Though, at the same
   time, it should be noted that now ISP would like to have a solution
   for Point-to-Point link which has own authentication mechanism first.
   PPP link with CHAP authentication is a good example.  (Simulated)
   Ethernet and IEEE802.11 (wireless LAN) should be covered in near

   future, but they have low priority (just) for now.  It should be
   clarified that the method should work with all L2 protocols either
   with authentication mechanism or without, but ISP would like to take
   advantage of a L2 protocol's authentication mechanism if it exits.

5. IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations in this document.

6. Security considerations

   Section 4.5 specifies security requirements for the prefix delegation
   mechanism.
