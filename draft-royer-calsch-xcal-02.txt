1.  Introduction

   The Extended Markup Language (XML) as defined in [XML] is gaining
   widespread attention as a "web friendly" syntax for representing and
   exchanging documents and data on the Internet.  This interest
   includes requests for and discussion of possible document type
   definitions (DTD) and name-space for IETF standard formats such as
   that defined by [iCAL].  This memo defines how XML can be used to
   represent iCalendar objects and does not specify a DTD as iCalendar
   can be extended.

   This format was selected to ease its translation back to the
   iCalendar format using an XSLT transform.  (See project iCalendar on
   SourceForge.com - http://sourceforge.net/projects/icalendar/ )

   NOTE: The [iCAL] is the definitive reference for the definition of
   iCalendar semantics.  This memo only provides an alternative, XML
   representation for the standard syntax defined in [iCAL].  This memo
   does not introduce any semantics not already defined by [RFC 2445].

   An attempt has been made to leverage the standard features of the XML
   syntax in order to represent the component iCalendar semantics.  For
   example, strong data typing is specified using the XML notation
   declaration.  The element type attributes are used to represent many
   of the calendar properties that provide a "global attribute"
   capability in an iCalendar object.  Binary content in the ATTACH
   component property may either be specified through an external entity
   reference to a non-XML binary content or may be included in the XML
   document's content information, after first being encoding using the
   BASE64 scheme of [RFC 2146].

   The publication of XML version 1.0 was followed by the publication of
   a World-wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation on "Namespaces in
   XML".  A XML name-space is a collection of names, identified by a
   URI.  In anticipation of the broader use of XML namespaces.  Within
   this memo the term "xCal" will mean the XML namespace usage as
   described in this memo.

2.  Using XML For Representating iCalendar

   XML is a simplified version of the text markup syntax defined by ISO
   8879, Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).  XML was published
   as a proposed recommendation [XML] by the World-wide Web Consortium
   (W3C) on February 10, 1998.

   In iCalendar names can be in upper case, lower case, or mixed case.
   In xCal the predefined iCaledars names will be represented in lower
   case only as XML element and attribute names are case sensitive..
   Values to properties and parameters that are user specified may be in
   upper, lower, or mixed case.

   All iCalendar component names will be represented in xCal as XML
   element names in lower case.  The "BEGIN" iCalendar component will be
   represented in xCal as: <begin>.

   All iCalendar property names will be represented in xCal as XML
   element names in lower case.

   All iCalendar parameter names will be represented in xCal as XML
   attribute names in lower case.

   All iCalendar predefined names that are used as values will be
   represented in xCal in lower case.

   This example:

        BEGIN:VCALENDAR
        VERSION:2.0
        PRODID:-//hacksw/handcal//NONSGML v1.0//EN

        SUMMARY;LANGUAGE="en_US":Bastille Day Party
        END:VEVENT
        END:VCALENDAR

   Is represented in xCal as:

2.1  XML Dependencies

   This memo specifies the XML representation for the standard iCalendar
   format defined by [iCAL].  There are no XML dependencies other than
   the [XML] and the [XMLNS] recommendations.

2.2  Working With Standard and XML iCalendar Representations

   This memo defines an alternative, XML representation for the standard
   iCalendar format defined in [iCAL].  This alternative representation
   provides the same semantics as that defined in the standard format.
   It is the goal of this memo to allow all [iCAL] extensions and
   modifications to be translated into and from this XML format.

2.2.1  Conversion

   The standard format can be converted to and from this XML format
   without loss of any calendaring information.  When the XML
   representation was defined, every attempt was made to use existing
   component, property and parameter naming conventions.  This greatly
   facilitates transformations between the two representations.

2.2.2  Mixed Use of Both Representations

   As previously indicated, conversion between the standard and XML
   representations of iCalendar is a straightforward process.  In
   addition, mixed use of both representations is also possible using
   MIME objects.

   With the use of the MIME multipart content-types, compound MIME
   entities containing a mix of the standard and XML representations can
   be specified.  This capability is useful in applications where both
   representations might be encountered.  In addition, this capability

Internet-Draft               xCal-Basic-RSS                  August 2005


   demonstrates the isomeric nature of the two representations.  XML
   applications conforming to this specification MUST be able to
   properly parse and process a MIME multipart entity containing the
   MIME type associated with this iCalendar XML document type.

   Internet applications conforming to this memo MUST only send the
   iCalendar XML document in a "multipart/alternative" MIME entity that
   also contains an equivalent iCalendar object in the standard format
   defined by [RFC2445].  This restriction will guarantee that the
   iCalendar object can also be processed by Internet applications that
   only support the standard iCalendar representation.

2.3  Using Data Types

   Strong "data typing" is an integral design principle to the iCalendar
   format.  Strong data typing in iCalendar means that the format type
   for each property value is well known.  Within [iCAL], the data type
   is called the "value type".  The standard format defined by [RFC
   2445] specifies a default value type for each calendar and component
   property.  In addition, many of the property definitions allow for
   the specification of alternate value types.  This XML representation
   continues this design principle.

   Explicit value/data typing in the XML representation is specified
   with the "value" attribute on each element type.  XML documents
   conforming to this memo need only specify the "value" attribute on
   element types when the value needs to override the default value/data
   type defined in the iCalendar specifications.  The formal public
   identifier for standard value types all have the common string format
   of:

2.4  Including Binary Content

   Binary content can be included in an iCalendar object with the
   "ATTACH" component property.  In the standard iCalendar format this
   content may either be specified through an external entity reference,
   using a URI value type, or maybe specified within the iCalendar
   object, after first BASE64 encoding the content.

   The XML representation for iCalendar also supports including binary
   content in an iCalendar object with the "attach" element type.  It
   also supports either an external reference to the non-XML binary
   content or inclusion of the binary content after first encoding the
   binary information using the BASE64 encoding of [MIME].

      dHNjYXBlIENvbW11bmljYXR5z...and so on...IENvcnBvc==</attach>


2.5  Including Multiple iCalendar Objects

   The iCalendar format has the capability for including multiple,
   individual iCalendar objects in a single data stream.  The XML
   representation can support this also.  Individual iCalendar objects
   are specified by the "vcalendar" element type.  One or more
   "vcalendar" element types are permitted within the parent element
   type, called "iCalendar".  For example:

        <iCalendar xmlns:xCal="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xcal">
           <vcalendar>
           <version>2.0</version>
                <!-- remainder of the first vcalendar object -->
           </vcalendar>
           <vcalendar>
           <version>2.0</version>
                <!-- remainder of the second vcalendar object -->
           </vcalendar>>
      </iCalendar>


2.6  Mapping Property Parameters to XML

   The property parameters defined in the standard iCalendar format are
   represented in the XML representation as an attribute on element
   types.  The following table specifies some of the attribute name
   corresponding to each property parameter.  This is true for all
   iCalendar object parameters defined in any iCalendar specification.
   The property and paramater names will be all lower case.  Here are
   some iCalendar parameter names and how they are mapped to their lower
   case xCal names.

   NOTE: that the iCalendar "language" parameter is converted to the
   "xml:lang" attribute as an exception to the one to one mapping.

   information about an iCalendar object, as a whole.  The calendar
   properties are represented in the XML representation as element types

   and them mapped to xCal lower case names:

2.9  Mapping All Values to XML

   The [iCAL] specification specifies that the equivalent component
   properties to the "comment", "description", "location", "summary" and
   "contact" element types can contain formatted content, such as is
   specified by multiple lines of text.  In such cases, the formatted
   text should be specified in as CDATA Section content.  The CDATA
   section specifies arbitrary character data that is not meant to be
   interpretted.  It is not scanned for markup by the XML parser.  The
   CDATA Section in these element types MUST NOT contain markup or other
   such alternate representation of the property value.

   Values MUST NOT be mapped to lower case. iCalendar property values
   and iCalendar parameter values are used without lower case
   conversion.

   Vaues that have characters forbidden by XML MUST be encoded using
   standard XML escaping mechanisms.

   Values that containe XML tags like in this example:


             DESCRIPTION:How to map xml DESCRIPTION into
              an XML <description> element.


   Would be encoded using standard XML encoding as shown here:

              an XML &lt;description&gt; element.</description>



2.10  Emailing the iCalendar XML Representation

   It is expected that iCalendar XML documents will need to be sent over
   SMTP/MIME email.  The "text/xml" and "application/xml" content-types
   have been registered for XML documents.  However, use of these
   content-type definitions present some problems for XML applications
   such as calendaring and scheduling.

   The "text/xml" and "application/xml" content-type definitions do not
   provide for any header field parameters to identify the type of XML
   document contained in the MIME entity.  This means that a recipient
   mail user agent must (MUA) open up each "text/xml" or "application/
   xml" content in order to determine what object handler is needed to
   process the information.  To a MUA, all XML documents look like just
   plain "text/xml" or "application/xml" content.

   Additionally, it is accepted practice for a MUA to provide iconic
   feedback to the user for individual content-types that are supported
   by the MUA.  For example, not only would feedback be provided for a
   calendaring and scheduling content.  Some further unique
   identification would also be provided for each different scheduling
   message; such as a meeting invitation, response to an invitation,
   reschedule notice, cancellation notice, etc.  In such cases,
   acceptable performance by the MUA is dependent on the existence of
   header field information, such as it provided in the definition of
   the "text/calendar" content-type by [iCAL].

   Internet application conforming to this memo MUST identify iCalendar
   XML documents with the experimental content-type "application/
   calendar+xml".  The content-type header field SHOULD also contain a
   "component" and "method" parameter to clearly identify a comma-
   separated list of components and the singular method used in the
   iCalendar XML document.  For example, an iCalendar XML document
   specifying a REQUEST for a VEVENT would be specified with the
   following content-type header field:

      content-type:application/calendar+xml;method=REQUEST;component=VEVENT

   The content-type can also include the "optinfo" parameter to specify
   any other optional iCalendar information.  The semantics of these
   content-type parameters is as defined in [iCAL].

   Internet applications conforming to this memo MUST only send the

   iCalendar XML document in a "multipart/alternative" MIME entity that
   also contains an equivalent iCalendar object in the standard format
   defined by [iCAL].  This restrict will guarantee that the iCalendar
   object can also be processed by internet applications that only
   support the standard iCalendar format.

   An XML application supporting the iCalendar XML document type MUST be
   able to receive and properly process the "application/calendar+xml"
   document contained within a "multipart" message content-type.

2.11  iCalendar XML Representation and File Systems

   The iCalendar XML documents will be stored in file systems.  The
   accepted practice for file extensions for XML documents is the text
   "XML".  However, in order to uniquely identify iCalendar XML
   documents for file association with applications that can directly
   process this document type, it is RECOMMENDED that the file extension
   be the text "XCS".

   sections to represent content for specific element types.  The CDATA
   section specifies arbitrary character data that is not meant to be
   interpretted.  It is not scanned by the XML parser for markup.  While
   this memo restricts that any CDATA section MUST NOT contain markup or
   other such alternate representation for the property value, in
   general, CDATA section from a non-conformant implementation can
   contain content such as HTML markup.  HTML text can be used to invoke
   programs.  Implementors should be aware that this may leave an
   implementation open to malicious attack that might occur as a result
   of executing the markup in the CDATA section.

   PROCEDURAL ALARMS - - A XML iCalendar document can be created that
   contains a "VEVENT" calendar component with "VALARM" calendar
   components.  The "VALARM" calendar component can be of type PROCEDURE
   and can have an attachment containing some sort of executable
   program.  Implementations that incorporate these types of alarms are
   subject to any virus or malicious attack that might occur as a result
   of executing the attachment.

   ATTACHMENTS - - A XML iCalendar document can include references to
   Uniform Resource Locators that can be programmed resources.
   Implementers and users of this memo should be aware of the network
   security implications of accepting and parsing such information.

   In addition, the security considerations observed by implementations
   of electronic mail systems should be followed for this memo.
