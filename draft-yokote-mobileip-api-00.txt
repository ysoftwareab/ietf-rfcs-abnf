Abstract 
    
   The Mobile IP API is an interface between the mobility management 
   and the application layer.  Using Mobile IP API, the applications 
   can extract the mobility information that is already maintained by 
   the mobility management module.  API simply provides awareness of 
   mobility for applications. 
    
   This document describes application scenarios followed by 
   requirements for Mobile IP API.  Application scenarios are example 
   applications that can take advantage of the mobility information.  
   The requirements are intended to define the scope of a Mobile IP API 
   and guide the design of API implementation.

1.0     Introduction  
    
   The Mobile IP API is an interface between mobility management and 
   application layer. See figure-1.0.  MM in this figure indicates 
   Mobility Management.

   The basic functionality of the Mobile IP API is to simply enable 
   applications to get mobility information about the host they are 
   running on or other hosts they are communicating with.  Using Mobile 
   IP, mobility management (module) already has the mobility 
   information. There is no need to generate any extra signaling

   between the MN and the CN, or change the functionality of current 
   Mobile IP [3] [5] functions for the host to obtain mobility 
   information. 
    
   API at this stage can be called Basic Mobile IP API.  Basic API 
   deals with "reading mobility information". In addition, advanced 
   Mobile IP API would be considered at a later stage.  In order to 
   meet the demands of sophisticated applications, advanced Mobile IP 
   API would enable them to "control mobility".  The advanced API would 
   be discussed in a future revision of this document. 
    
   Mobile IP has been designed to provide network layer mobility in a 
   transparent manner and with use of Mobile IP it is understood that 
   there is no need to let the application layer know about underlying 
   mobility of mobile terminals.  However, it does not mean that the 
   application layer should not know about mobility of mobile terminal.  
   It can be advantageous to pass mobility information from IP layer to 
   applications.  A mobility aware application can exploit such 
   information in many different ways, and some of these are discussed 
   in usage scenarios. 
    
   Mobility information can be rephrased as awareness of MN's location 
   and movement.  Location awareness is about querying the current 
   location of a mobile node, either home or away from home.  Movement 
   awareness is about getting notification of a mobile node's movement. 
   Both location and movement awareness would happen on both mobile 
   node and its correspondent nodes.  A location of Mobile node refers 
   to location in IP topology, not a geographic location. Mapping IP 
   topological location to geographical location is outside the scope 
   of this API. 
    
   Mobile IP API does not generate any extra signaling between the MN 
   and CN. The API only relies on receipt of Binding Update on the CN 
   to provide information to the applications running on the CN.

3.0     Usage Scenarios 
    
   This section describes the example application scenarios for basic 
   Mobile IP API.  The following scenarios apply to one of four classes 
   of usage. 
    
   (a) MN queries the its own location; 
   (b) MN gets notification of its own movement, and new location;  
   (c) CN queries the MN's location; and  
   (d) CN gets notification of MN's movement, and new location  
    
   Section 3.1 explains Email access service scenario which can apply 
   to usage (a).  Section 3.2 explains local service discovery scenario 
   which can apply to usage (b).  And section 3.3 explains news 
   delivery service scenario which can apply to usage (d). 
    
   3.1 E-mail access scenario 
    
   This section describes the E-mail access scenario.  This is the case 
   that the MN queries the its own location.

   When a user is roaming in a visited network, may need to pay a fee 
   with higher rate than rate in home network.  That makes user to 
   avoid downloading large size of e-mail attachment files at visited 
   network if those files are not needed right away.  The user can get 
   all files when gets back home.  The E-mail access application on MN 
   gets mobility information (MN's location) from mobility management, 
   and then application initiates request which includes choice of 
   download according to the detection of location.  The mail server 
   responds differently to different request. The messages will be 
   downloaded with or without attachments from the server.  For example, 
   in the figure-3.1 below, API on MN queries MN's location to MM-layer 
   (1), and the application initiates request downloading messages

   without attached files in this case (2).  POP [4](mail) server 
   responds and messages are downloaded without attachments. 
    
   3.2 Local service discovery 
    
   This section describes the local service discovery scenario.  This 
   is the case that the MN gets notification of its own movement, and 
   new location. 
    
   The user would like to use the nearest printer. Usually when the 
   user requests to access printer at visited area, need to access SLP 
   [2] first and, learn the location of local printer.  However, it is 
   desirable the location of printer will be found automatically 
   whenever MN moved to new area.  For example, in the figure-3.2 below, 
   when MN gets new CoA (1), application gets mobility information from 
   mobility management (2), and then the application can initiate SLP 
   lookup (3) and finds the nearest printer for MN in advance (4).  Now, 
   whenever user requests printing job at visited area (5), the 
   application is already aware the address of local printer.

   3.3 Location based content delivery 
    
   This section describes the location based content delivery scenario.  
   This is the case that a CN gets notification of MN's movement, and 
   new location. 
    
   The CN works as news contents server.  The CN keeps track of MN's 
   movement by receiving a binding update from MN.  In the figure-3.3 

     
                         Expires August 2002                 [Page 5]

   below, every time CN gets a binding update form MN (1), application 
   gets mobility information from mobility management on CN (2).  Now, 
   the application initiates to map the MN's IP address to geographic 
   location (3), and the CN releases local news or advertisements to MN 
   based on the geographic location (4).  To do so, CN which acts as a 
   news server, need to learn movement of MN and location.

4.0     Requirements 
    
   This section describes the requirements of Mobile IP API. 
   Identifying following requirements that will render to the API 
   becomes essential in designing a widely accepted solution. 
    
   4.1 Location awareness 
    
   Mobile IP API must enable applications to learn MN's location (i.e., 
   whether the MN is at home, or it is away from home and has a CoA). 
   These applications might be running on the MN itself, or a CN that 
   this MN is corresponding with. 
    
   4.2 Movement awareness 
    
   Mobile IP API must enable applications to get notified when MN 
   changes location. These applications might be running on the MN 
   itself, or a CN that this MN is corresponding with. 
    
   4.3 Use of API 
    
   Basic Mobile IP API should be read-only function to avoid affects 
   the operation of any other application on the device or same machine.

   Internet Draft           Mobile IP API               February 2002 
    
    
   4.4 Scope of Mobile IP API 
    
   Basic Mobile IP API must be designed specific to Mobile IP, and not 
   to generate new signaling or change functions of Mobile IP protocols. 
   [3] [5] It should work for both Mobile IPv4 and Mobile IPv6. 
    
 
5.0     Security Considerations 
    
   5.1 Location Privacy 
 
   As previously stated, Mobile IP API does not generate extra 
   signaling between the MN and the CN.  For providing information to 
   the applications running on the CN, the API only relies on receipt 
   of Binding Updates on the CN.  If the MN does not send a Binding 
   Update for any reason including location privacy, this API will not 
   provide any information to the applications running on the CN.  As 
   such, this API does not reveal any information other than what MN is 
   willing to provide.
