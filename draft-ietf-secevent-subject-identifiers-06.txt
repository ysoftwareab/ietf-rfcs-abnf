             Subject Identifiers for Security Event Tokens
               draft-ietf-secevent-subject-identifiers-06

Abstract

   Security events communicated within Security Event Tokens may support
   a variety of identifiers to identify the subject and/or other
   principals related to the event.  This specification formalizes the
   notion of subject identifiers as named sets of well-defined claims
   describing the subject, a mechanism for representing subject
   identifiers within a JSON object such as a JSON Web Token (JWT) or
   Security Event Token (SET), and a registry for defining and
   allocating names for these claim sets.

1.  Introduction

   As described in Section 1.2 of SET [RFC8417], the subject of a
   security event may take a variety of forms, including but not limited
   to a JWT [RFC7519] principal, an IP address, a URL, etc.
   Furthermore, even in the case where the subject of an event is more
   narrowly scoped, there may be multiple ways by which a given subject
   may be identified.  For example, an account may be identified by an

   opaque identifier, an email address, a phone number, a JWT "iss"
   claim and "sub" claim, etc., depending on the nature and needs of the
   transmitter and receiver.  Even within the context of a given
   transmitter and receiver relationship, it may be appropriate to
   identify different accounts in different ways, for example if some
   accounts only have email addresses associated with them while others
   only have phone numbers.  Therefore it can be necessary to indicate
   within a SET the mechanism by which the subject of the security event
   is being identified.

   To address this problem, this specification defines Subject
   Identifiers - JSON [RFC7159] objects containing information
   identifying a subject - and Subject Identifier Types - named sets of
   rules describing how to encode different kinds of subject identifying
   information (e.g., an email address, or an issuer and subject pair)
   as a Subject Identifier.

   Below is a non-normative example of a Subject Identifier that
   identifies a subject by email address, using the Email Subject
   Identifier Type.

   {
     "subject_type": "email",
     "email": "user@example.com",
   }

       Figure 1: Example: Subject Identifier using the Email Subject
                              Identifier Type

   Subject Identifiers are intended to be a general purpose mechanism
   for identifying principals within JSON objects.  Below is a non-
   normative example of a JWT that uses a Subject Identifier in the
   "sub_id" claim (defined in this specification) to identify its
   subject.

   {
     "iss": "issuer.example.com",
     "sub_id": {
       "subject_type": "phone_number",
       "phone_number": "+12065550100",
     },
   }

   security event describing the interception of a message, using

   Subject Identifiers to identify the sender, intended recipient, and
   interceptor.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.1.  Definitions

   This specification utilizes terminology defined in [RFC7159],
   [RFC7519], and [RFC8417].

3.  Subject Identifiers

   A Subject Identifier is a JSON [RFC7159] object whose contents may be
   used to identify a principal within some context.  A Subject
   Identifier Type is a named definition of a set of information that
   may be used to identify a principal, and the rules for encoding that
   information as a Subject Identifier.  A Subject Identifier MUST
   conform to a specific Subject Identifier Type, and MUST contain a

Internet-Draft        secevent-subject-identifiers        September 2020


   "subject_type" member whose value is the name of that Subject
   Identifier Type.

   Every Subject Identifier Type MUST have a unique name registered in
   the IANA "Security Event Subject Identifier Types" registry
   established by Section 7.1, or a Collision-Resistant Name as defined
   in [RFC7519].  Subject Identifier Types that are expected to be used
   broadly by a variety of parties SHOULD be registered in the "Security
   Event Subject Identifier Types" registry.

   A Subject Identifier Type MAY describe more members than are strictly
   necessary to identify a subject, and MAY describe conditions under
   which those members are required, optional, or prohibited.

   Aside from the "subject_type" member whose definition is given above,
   every member within a Subject Identifier MUST match the format
   specified for that member by the Subject Identifier's Subject
   Identifier Type.  A Subject Identifier MUST NOT contain any members
   prohibited or not described by its Subject Identifier Type, and MUST
   contain all members required by its Subject Identifier Type.

3.1.  Subject Identifier Types versus Principal Types

   A Subject Identifier Type describes a way to identify a principal,
   but does not explicitly indicate the type of that principal (e.g.,
   user, group, network connection, baseball team, astronomic object).
   Consequently Subject Identifiers remove ambiguity around how a
   principal is being identified, and how to parse an identifying
   structure, but they do not remove ambiguity around how to resolve
   that identifier to a principal.  For example, consider a directory
   management API that allows callers to identify users and groups
   through both immutable unique identifiers and mutable email
   addresses.  Such an API could use Subject Identifiers to disambiguate
   between which of these two types of identifiers is in use.  However,
   the service would have to determine whether the principal is a user
   or group via some other means, such as by querying a database or by
   inferring the type from the API contract.

3.2.  Subject Identifier Type Definitions

   The following Subject Identifier Types are registered in the IANA
   "Security Event Subject Identifier Types" registry established by
   Section 7.1.

3.2.1.  Account Subject Identifier Type

   The Account Subject Identifier Type identifies a principal using an
   account at a service provider, identified with an "acct" URI as
   defined in [RFC7565].  Subject Identifiers of this type MUST contain
   a "uri" member whose value is the "acct" URI for the subject.  The
   "uri" member is REQUIRED and MUST NOT be null or empty.  The Account
   Subject Identifier Type is identified by the name "account".

   Below is a non-normative example Subject Identifier for the Account
   Subject Identifier Type:

   {
     "subject_type": "account",
     "uri": "acct:example.user@service.example.com",
   }

       Figure 4: Example: Subject Identifier for the Account Subject
                              Identifier Type

3.2.2.  Email Subject Identifier Type

   The Email Subject Identifier Type identifies a principal using an
   email address.  Subject Identifiers of this type MUST contain an
   "email" member whose value is a string containing the email address
   of the principal, formatted as an "addr-spec" as defined in
   Section 3.4.1 of [RFC5322].  The "email" member is REQUIRED and MUST
   NOT be null or empty.  The value of the "email" member SHOULD
   identify a mailbox to which email may be delivered, in accordance
   with [RFC5321].  The Email Subject Identifier Type is identified by
   the name "email".

   Below is a non-normative example Subject Identifier for the Email
   Subject Identifier Type:

   {
     "subject_type": "email",
     "email": "user@example.com",
   }

        Figure 5: Example: Subject Identifier for the Email Subject
                              Identifier Type

3.2.2.1.  Email Canonicalization

   Many email providers will treat multiple email addresses as
   equivalent.  While the domain portion of an [RFC5322] email address
   is consistently treated as case-insensitive per [RFC1034], some



Backman & Scurtescu       Expires March 8, 2021                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        secevent-subject-identifiers        September 2020


   providers treat the local part of the email address as case-
   insensitive as well, and consider "user@example.com",
   "User@example.com", and "USER@example.com" as the same email address.
   This has led users to view these strings as equivalent, driving
   service providers to implement proprietary email canonicalization
   algorithms to ensure that email addresses entered by users resolve to
   the same canonical string.  When receiving an Email Subject
   Identifier, the recipient SHOULD use their implementation's
   canonicalization algorithm to resolve the email address to the same
   string used in their system.

3.2.3.  Phone Number Subject Identifier Type

   The Phone Number Subject Identifier Type identifies a principal using
   a telephone number.  Subject Identifiers of this type MUST contain a
   "phone_number" member whose value is a string containing the full
   telephone number of the principal, including international dialing
   prefix, formatted according to E.164 [E164].  The "phone_number"
   member is REQUIRED and MUST NOT be null or empty.  The Phone Number
   Subject Identifier Type is identified by the name "phone_number".

   Below is a non-normative example Subject Identifier for the Email
   Subject Identifier Type:

   {
     "subject_type": "phone_number",
     "phone_number": "+12065550100",
   }

    Figure 6: Example: Subject Identifier for the Phone Number Subject
                             Identifier Type.

3.2.4.  Issuer and Subject Subject Identifier Type

   The Issuer and Subject Subject Identifier Type identifies a principal
   using a pair of "iss" and "sub" members, analagous to how subjects
   are identified using the "iss" and "sub" claims in OpenID Connect
   [OpenID.Core] ID Tokens.  These members MUST follow the formats of
   the "iss" member and "sub" member defined by [RFC7519], respectively.
   Both the "iss" member and the "sub" member are REQUIRED and MUST NOT
   be null or empty.  The Issuer and Subject Subject Identifier Type is
   identified by the name "iss_sub".

   Below is a non-normative example Subject Identifier for the Issuer
   and Subject Subject Identifier Type:

   }

     Figure 7: Example: Subject Identifier for the Issuer and Subject
                          Subject Identifier Type

3.2.5.  Aliases Subject Identifier Type

   The Aliases Subject Identifier Type describes a subject that is
   identified with a list of different Subject Identifiers.  It is
   intended for use when a variety of identifiers have been shared with
   the party that will be interpreting the Subject Identifier, and it is
   unknown which of those identifiers they will recognize or support.
   Subject Identifiers of this type MUST contain an "identifiers" member
   whose value is a JSON array containing one or more Subject
   Identifiers.  Each Subject Identifier in the array MUST identify the
   same entity.  The "identifiers" member is REQUIRED and MUST NOT be
   null or empty.  It MAY contain multiple instances of the same Subject
   Identifier Type (e.g., multiple Email Subject Identifiers), but
   SHOULD NOT contain exact duplicates.  This type is identified by the
   name "aliases".

   "alias" Subject Identifiers MUST NOT be nested; i.e., the
   "identifiers" member of an "alias" Subject Identifier MUST NOT
   contain a Subject Identifier of type "aliases".

   Below is a non-normative example Subject Identifier for the Aliases
   Subject Identifier Type:

4.  Subject Identifiers in JWTs

4.1.  "sub_id" Claim

   The "sub" JWT Claim is defined in Section 4.1.2 of [RFC7519] as
   containing a string value, and therefore cannot contain a Subject
   Identifier (which is a JSON object) as its value.  This document
   defines the "sub_id" JWT Claim, in accordance with Section 4.2 of
   [RFC7519], as a common claim that identifies the subject of the JWT
   using a Subject Identifier.  When present, the value of this claim
   MUST be a Subject Identifier that identifies the principal that is
   the subject of the JWT.  The "sub_id" claim MAY be included in a JWT,
   whether or not the "sub" claim is present.  When both the "sub" and
   "sub_id" claims are present in a JWT, they MUST identify the same
   principal.

   When processing a JWT with both "sub" and "sub_id" claims,
   implementations MUST NOT rely on both claims to determine the
   subject.  An implementation MAY attempt to determine the subject from
   one claim and fall back to using the other if it determines it does
   not understand the format of the first claim.  For example, an
   implementation may attempt to use "sub_id", and fall back to using
   "sub" upon finding that "sub_id" contains a Subject Identifier whose
   type is not recognized by the implementation.

   Below are non-normative examples of JWTs containing the "sub_id"
   claim:

   }

4.2.  "sub_id" and "iss_sub" Subject Identifiers

   The "sub_id" claim MAY contain an "iss_sub" Subject Identifier.  In
   this case, the JWT's "iss" claim and the Subject Identifier's "iss"
   member MAY be different.  For example, an OpenID Connect
   [OpenID.Core] client may construct such a JWT when issuing a JWT back
   to its OpenID Connect Identity Provider, in order to communicate
   information about the services' shared subject principal using an
   identifier the Identity Provider is known to understand.  Similarly,
   the JWT's "sub" claim and the Subject Identifier's "sub" member MAY
   be different.  For example, this may be used by an OpenID Connect
   client to communicate the subject principal's local identifier at the
   client back to its Identity Provider.

   Below are non-normative examples of a JWT where the "iss" claim and
   "iss" member within the "sub_id" claim are the same, and a JWT where
   they are different.

   {
     "iss": "issuer.example.com",
     "sub_id": {
       "subject_type": "iss_sub",
       "iss": "issuer.example.com",
       "sub": "example_user",
     },
   }

                  issuer and subject issuer are the same

5.  Privacy Considerations

5.1.  Identifier Correlation

   The act of presenting two or more identifiers for a single principal
   together (e.g., within an "aliases" Subject Identifier, or via the
   "sub" and "sub_id" JWT claims) may communicate more information about
   the principal than was intended.  For example, the entity to which
   the identifiers are presented, now knows that both identifiers relate
   to the same principal, and may be able to correlate additional data
   based on that.  When transmitting Subject Identifiers, the
   transmitter SHOULD take care that they are only transmitting multiple
   identifiers together when it is known that the recipient already
   knows that the identifiers are related (e.g., because they were
   previously sent to the recipient as claims in an OpenID Connect ID
   Token), or when correlation is essential to the use case.

   The considerations described in Section 6 of [RFC8417] also apply
   when Subject Identifiers are used within SETs.  The considerations
   described in Section 12 of [RFC7519] also apply when Subject
   Identifiers are used within JWTs.

6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  Confidentiality and Integrity

   This specification does not define any mechanism for ensuring the
   confidentiality or integrityi of a Subject Identifier.  Where such
   properties are required, implementations MUST use mechanisms provided
   by the containing format (e.g., integrity protecting SETs or JWTs
   using JWS [RFC7515]), or at the transport layer or other layer in the
   application stack (e.g., using TLS [RFC8446]).

   Further considerations regarding confidentiality and integrity of
   SETs can be found in Section 5.1 of [RFC8417].

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Security Event Subject Identifier Types Registry

   This document defines Subject Identifier Types, for which IANA is
   asked to create and maintain a new registry titled "Security Event
   Subject Identifier Types".  Initial values for the Security Event
   Subject Identifier Types registry are given in Section 3.  Future
   assignments are to be made through the Expert Review registration
   policy [BCP26] and shall follow the template presented in
   Section 7.1.2.

   It is suggested that multiple Designated Experts be appointed who are
   able to represent the perspectives of different applications using
   this specification, in order to enable broadly informed review of
   registration decisions.  In cases where a registration decision could
   be perceived as creating a conflict of interest for a particular
   Expert, that Expert should defer to the judgment of the other
   Experts.

7.1.1.  Registry Location

   (This section to be removed by the RFC Editor before publication as
   an RFC.)

   The authors recommend that the Subject Identifier Types registry be
   located at "https://www.iana.org/assignments/secevent/".

7.1.2.  Registration Template

   Type Name
      The name of the Subject Identifier Type, as described in
      Section 3.  The name MUST be an ASCII string consisting only of
      lower-case characters ("a" - "z"), digits ("0" - "9"), underscores
      ("_"), and hyphens ("-"), and SHOULD NOT exceed 20 characters in
      length.

   Type Description
      A brief description of the Subject Identifier Type.

   Change Controller
      For types defined in documents published by the IETF or its
      working groups, list "IETF".  For all other types, list the name
      of the party responsible for the registration.  Contact

      information such as mailing address, email address, or phone
      number may also be provided.

   Defining Document(s)
      A reference to the document or documents that define the Subject
      Identifier Type.  The definition MUST specify the name, format,
      and meaning of each member that may occur within a Subject
      Identifier of the defined type, as well as whether each member is
      optional, required, prohibited, or the circumstances under which
      the member may be optional, required, or prohibited.  URIs that
      can be used to retrieve copies of each document SHOULD be
      included.

7.1.3.  Initial Registry Contents

7.1.3.1.  Account Subject Identifier Type

   o  Type Name: "account"

   o  Type Description: Subject identifier based on "acct" URI.

   o  Change Controller: IETF

   o  Defining Document(s): Section 3 of this document.

7.1.3.2.  Email Subject Identifier Type

   o  Type Name: "email"

   o  Type Description: Subject identifier based on email address.

   o  Change Controller: IETF

   o  Defining Document(s): Section 3 of this document.

7.1.3.3.  Issuer and Subject Subject Identifier Type

   o  Type Name: "iss_sub"

7.1.3.4.  Phone Number Subject Identifier Type

   o  Type Name: "phone_number"

   o  Type Description: Subject identifier based on an phone number.

   o  Change Controller: IETF

   o  Defining Document(s): Section 3 of this document.

7.1.3.5.  Aliases Subject Identifier Type

   o  Type Name: "aliases"

   o  Type Description: Subject identifier that groups together multiple
      different subject identifiers for the same subject.

   o  Change Controller: IETF

   o  Defining Document(s): Section 3 of this document.

7.1.4.  Guidance for Expert Reviewers

   The Expert Reviewer is expected to review the documentation
   referenced in a registration request to verify its completeness.  The
   Expert Reviewer must base their decision to accept or reject the
   request on a fair and impartial assessment of the request.  If the
   Expert Reviewer has a conflict of interest, such as being an author
   of a defining document referenced by the request, they must recuse
   themselves from the approval process for that request.  In the case
   where a request is rejected, the Expert Reviewer should provide the
   requesting party with a written statement expressing the reason for
   rejection, and be prepared to cite any sources of information that
   went into that decision.

   Subject Identifier Types need not be generally applicable and may be
   highly specific to a particular domain; it is expected that types may
   be registered for niche or industry-specific use cases.  The Expert
   Reviewer should focus on whether the type is thoroughly documented,
   and whether its registration will promote or harm interoperability.
   In most cases, the Expert Reviewer should not approve a request if
   the registration would contribute to confusion, or amount to a
   synonym for an existing type.
