1.  Introduction

   The IP address plays a significant role in the communication of the
   current Internet.  Also, IP address generation is closely related to
   the manageability, security, privacy protection, and traceability of
   the networks.  Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)
   [RFC3315] is an important network protocol that can be used to
   dynamically provide IPv6 addresses and other network configuration
   parameters to IPv6 hosts.  Actually, DHCPv6 continues to be extended
   and improved through being added new options and defined new
   protocols or message processing mechanisms.

   Even if DHCPv6 provides more and more comprehensive functionality and
   many DHCPv6 server software have provided extension interfaces to
   allow users to alter and customize the way how they handle and
   respond to DHCPv6 messages, a general insight of how to solve the
   extension problem effectively is lack.  We should figure out where
   and how to conduct extensions in the DHCPv6.  Therefore, a detailed

   analysis is required to clarify the problems, design principles, and
   extract and unify the design specifications to help better solve the
   extension problems.

   In summary, multiple extensions can be conducted on DHCPv6 to support
   the user's self-defined functionality.  As DHCPv6 is such an
   important and useful protocol related to IPv6 addresses generation,
   it can provide more extended and flexible functionality to meet
   users' requirements.  According to well-designed principles, extended
   interfaces can be defined to support more self-defined multi-
   requirement extensions without sacrificing the stability of DHCPv6.

   Some people would suggest the user modify the open-source DHCP
   servers to solve their own problem.  However, a great amount of time
   will be taken to understand the open source DHCP server code, not to
   say the consuming time debugging the bugs, failures or system crash
   caused by modifying the complicated modules.  Another problem is that
   as the open source software evolves, the source code of the server
   software may change (new functionality or fixing bugs).  Users may
   need to re-write their codes once the new version of open-source
   server software comes out [kea_dhcp_hook_developers_guide] . Hence,
   the multi-requirement extensions for DHCPv6 to solve users' specific
   problems are very necessary and significant.

   This document describes the current extension practices and typical
   DHCP server software on extensions and provides a problem statement
   by defining a DHCP general model, analyzing the unresolved multi-
   requirement extension problems, and providing possible directions for
   new work that could solve these problems.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   memo are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Familiarity with DHCPv6 and its terminology, as defined in [RFC3315],
   is assumed.

3.  Current Extension Practices

3.1.  Standardized and Non-standardized DHCPv6 Extension Cases

   Many documents attempt to extend the DHCPv6.  They can be classified
   into three categories.

   Extended options    Most extensions for DHCPv6 are implemented in
                       this way, e.g., DNS configurations [RFC3646], NIS

                       configurations [RFC3898], SNTP configurations
                       [RFC4075], information refresh time
                       configurations [RFC4242], remote-id [RFC4649],
                       FQDN configurations [RFC4704], relay agent echo
                       request [RFC4994], network boot [RFC5970], client
                       link-layer address [RFC6939].  New-defined
                       options carry specific parameters in the DHCPv6
                       messages, which helps DHCPv6 clients or servers
                       know the detailed situation with each other.

   Extended messages   Some documents define new protocols to achieve
                       specific purposes, e.g., secure DHCPv6
                       [draft-ietf-dhc-sedhcpv6-21], active leasequery
                       [RFC7653], GAGMS [GAGMS].  These protocols often
                       requires defining new messages and new options.

   Extended entities   Some documents introduce extra entities into the
                       communications of DHCPv6 to achieve specific
                       purpose, e.g., authentication [RFC7037].

3.2.  Current DHCPv6 Server Software Cases

   Many commercial and open source DHCP server software exist, including
   Cisco Prime Network Registrar [CPNR], Microsoft DHCP
   [Microsoft_DHCP], VitalQIP [VitalQIP], Nominum DHCP [Nominum_DHCP],
   ISC DHCP [ISC_DHCP], Kea DHCP [Kea_DHCP], FreeRADIUS DHCP
   [FreeRADIUS_DHCP], WIDE DHCPv6 [WIDE_DHCPv6], etc.  Commercial and
   open source DHCPv6 software often consider the extensions of DHCPv6
   servers because they all cannot always meet the requirements that the
   users want.  In this section, we introduce two typical DHCPv6
   software: Cisco Prime Network Registrar and Kea DHCP, respectively.

3.2.1.  Cisco Prime Network Registrar DHCP Server Extension APIs

   Cisco Prime Network Registrar (CPNR) [CPNR] is an appliance which
   provides integrated Domain Name Server, DHCP, and IP Address
   Management services for IPv4 and IPv6.  At the same time, CPNR DHCP
   server allows user to write extensions and functions to alter and
   customize how it handles and responds to DHCP requests.  A network
   operator usually decides what packets process to modify, how to
   modify, and which extension point to attach the extension.  Then the
   network operator just writes the extension and adds the well-written
   extension to the extension point of the DHCP server.  Finally, the
   network operator reloads the DHCP server and can find that the server
   will do what he/her wants the server to do.

3.2.2.  Kea DHCP Hook Mechanisms

   Kea DHCP provides hook mechanisms, a defined interface for third-
   party or user-written code, to solve the problem that the DHCP server
   does not quite do what a network operator require.  A network
   operator can use several well-defined framework functions to load and
   initialize a library and write specific callout functions to attach
   to the hook points.  After building and configuring the hooks
   library, the server will do what the network operator require.
   Additionally, Kea DHCP allows users to use logging in the hooks
   library.

4.  Problem Statement

   This section elaborates the problem statement on multi-requirement
   extensions for DHCPv6.  Section 4.1 describes the general model of
   DHCP, while Section 4.2 analyzes the unresolved problems and
   requirements, suggesting possible future work.

4.1.  DHCP General Model

   Figure 1 summarizes the DHCP general model and its possible
   extensions: DHCP messages, options, message processing functions, and
   address generation mechanisms.

4.2.  Unresolved Problems

   Currently, DHCPv6 protocol solves the problem that basic options are
   transmitted in plaintext.  However, there are still many problems
   left to be resolved.  Section 4.2.1, Section 4.2.2, Section 4.2.3,
   and Section 4.2.4 discuss these problems.

4.2.1.  DHCP Messages

   People are always concerned about the security and privacy issues of
   DHCP protocol.  [RFC7819] and [RFC7824] consider the privacy issues
   associated with the use of DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 by the Internet users,
   respectively.  The current DHCP protocol does not resolve the problem
   that the options are transmitted in ciphertext.  That is to say, any
   other nodes can see the options transmitted in the DHCPv6 messages
   between a DHCPv6 client and servers.  Secure DHCPv6
   [draft-ietf-dhc-sedhcpv6-21] considers using public cryptography to
   provide a deployable security mechanism, which can transmit basic
   options in DHCP messages exchanged between clients and servers.
   However, this draft is currently dead in IESG.  In fact, new messages
   can be designed and added to DHCPv6 protocol, and DHCP messages can
   be exchanged in either plaintext or ciphertext.

4.2.2.  Options

   In other cases, network operators may require DHCP messages to
   transmit some self-defined options between clients and servers.
   However, no such mechanisms in the current DHCP protocol support this
   requirement.  DHCP clients do not allow users to transmit options not
   defined in standards, and not all DHCP server software support
   transmitting non-standardized options, either.  For example, [NIDTGA]
   modifies the DHCPv6 message exchanges by adding some new options with
   cryptographic options.  However, current DHCP standards do not
   provide related and flexible interfaces to meet such requirements.
   In fact, not only DHCP server software can provide interfaces for
   users to alter the way that they handle and respond to DHCP messages
   to meet their requirements, but DHCP client software can also provide
   such interfaces.

4.2.3.  Message Processing Functions

   Although current commercial or open-source DHCP server software
   provide comprehensive functionality, they still cannot meet all
   customers' requirements of processing DHCP requests.  Therefore,
   improved commercial or open-source DHCP server software will provide
   interfaces that customers can use to write their specific extensions
   to affect the way how DHCP servers handle and respond to DHCP
   requests.  For example, not all networks prefer to use DHCPv6 servers



Ren, et al.            Expires September 20, 2018               [Page 6]

   to assign the privacy-preserving random-form addresses generated by
   some fixed address generation mechanism to DHCPv6 clients.  Several
   address generation mechanisms for SLAAC [RFC4862] (e.g., IEEE 64-bit
   EUI-64 [RFC2464], Constant, semantically opaque [Microsoft],
   Temporary [RFC4941], and Stable, semantically opaque [RFC7217])
   proposed for different requirements can be also utilized in DHCPv6
   protocol.  The many types of IPv6 address generation mechanisms
   available have brought about flexibility and diversity.  Thus,
   network operators may alter their DHCPv6 servers through the given
   extensions to use their own preferred address generation mechanisms
   to assign addresses to DHCPv6 clients.  However, not all DHCP
   software consider this extension.

4.2.4.  Address Generation Mechanisms

   Different networks may prefer different address generation
   mechanisms.  However, current DHCPv6 protocol only considers
   generating random IPv6 addresses.  Corresponding interfaces should be
   open and defined to allow other address generation mechanisms to be
   configured.

4.2.5.  Extension Principles

   The principles used to conduct multi-requirement extensions for
   DHCPv6 are summarized as follows:

      1) Do not change the current DHCP general model.

      2) Use simpler interfaces to define and support more extensions.

5.  Security Considerations

   Security issues related with DHCPv6 are described in Section 23 of
   [RFC3315].

   Secure DHCPv6 [draft-ietf-dhc-sedhcpv6-21] attempts to provide a
   deployable security mechanism for end-to-end communication between
   DHCP clients and servers.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not include an IANA request.
