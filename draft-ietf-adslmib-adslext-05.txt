INTERNET-DRAFT          ADSL Line Extension MIB             June 5, 2000


   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o    An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [11].

   o    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
   STD
        16, RFC 1155 [14], STD 16, RFC 1212 [15] and RFC 1215 [16].  The
        second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578
        [1], STD 58, RFC 2579 [2] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [17].

   o    Message protocols for transferring management information.
        The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called
        SNMPv1 and described in RFC 1157 [7].  A second version of
        the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [18] and RFC 1906 [19].  The third version of the message
        protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [19], RFC
        2272 [20] and RFC 2274 [21].

   o    Protocol operations for accessing management information.
        The first set of protocol operations and associated PDU
        formats is described in RFC 1157 [7].  A second set of
        protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described
        in RFC 1905 [8].

   o    A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [22]
        and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC
        2275 [23].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This document specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.
   A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (e.g., use of Counter64).  Some machine
   readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual
   descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this
   loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the
   semantics of the MIB.

   5.  Introduction

      The purpose of this memo is to define a supplemental set of
   managed objects that is not covered by ADSL Line MIB as defined in
   [10].  This memo addresses the additional objects defined in ITU
   G.997.1 [8].  These additional objects specifically address the
   management capabilities of ADSL "Lite" as defined by ITU-T G.992.2
   [9].

   6.  Relationship of the ADSL LINE EXTENSION MIB with standard MIBs

   This section outlines the relationship of ADSL Line Extension MIB
   with other MIBs described in RFCs and in their various degrees of
   "standardization". ADSL Line Extension MIB obeys the same
   relationship between ADSL Line MIB to other standard MIBs with one
   exception for the ifOperStatus as defined in RFC 1213 [3].

   6.1 ifOperStatus



Expires September 2000                                          [Page 3]

INTERNET-DRAFT          ADSL Line Extension MIB             June 5, 2000


   ifOperStatus is set to down(2) when the ADSL line interface is in
   power state L2, which means no power.  ifOperStatus is set to up(1)
   if the ADSL line interface is in power state L0 (power on) or L1
   (reduced power).

   7.  Conventions used in the MIB

   7.1  Structure

   The MIB is organized to follow the same structure of the ADSL Line
   MIB [1].

   7.2  Additional Managed Objects

   A few objects are added to cover the ADSL "Lite" management and they
   are:

      - ATU-C Transmission System and Line Mode
      - Power Management
      - Counters for Fast Retrains and Failed Fast Retrains
      - Counters for Severe Error Second-line and Unavailable Second
      - Alternative profile configuration for the Dual line mode
   interface

      Besides the management of ADSL "Lite", another object has been
   added to the ADSL Line MIB [10] in order to manage the ADSL line
   profile.  The object is the line mode configuration.

      The MIB definitions are attached. The MIB will be branched from
   the ADSL Line MIB [10].

   7.2.1 ATU-C ADSL Transmission System Parameters and Line Mode

        The adslLineConfigTable needs to be extended to cover control of
   the ATU-C ADSL Transmission system.  Three objects are defined to
   monitor and configure the transmission mode as well as the actual
   line mode:

        - Capability
        - Configuration
        - Actual Status

        Transmission modes can further determine the line mode of the
   ADSL interface.  For example, if g9921PotsNonOverlapped(2) is the
   actual value of the ADSL interface, the interface is operating in
   Full rate ADSL.  If the interface is set to g9922PotsOverlapped(9),
   the interface is operating in G.lite mode.

INTERNET-DRAFT          ADSL Line Extension MIB             June 5, 2000


        The transmssion mode and the corresponding line mode are defined
   as:

        Transmission mode                 Line Mode
        ----------------------------------------------------------
        Regional Std. (ANSI T1.413)       Full
        Regional Std. (ETSI DTS/TM06006)  Full
        G.992.1 POTS non-overlapped       Full
        G.992.1 POTS overlapped           Full
        G.992.1 ISDN non-overlapped       Full
        G.992.1 ISDN overlapped           Full
        G.992.1 TCM-ISDN non-overlapped   Full
        G.992.1 TCM-ISDN overlapped       Full
        G.992.2 POTS non-overlapped       Lite
        G.992.2 POTS overlapped           Lite
        G.992.2 with TCM-ISDN non-overlapped  Lite
        G.992.2 with TCM-ISDN overlapped      Lite

                     Table 1: Transmission Mode and Line Mode

        In case more than one bit is configured for an ADSL interface
   and both Full and Lite modes are selected, the interface is said to
   configure in the dual mode.  Only one bit can be set in the Actual
   object that reflects the actual mode of transmission as well as the
   line mode.

   7.2.2 Power Management

        There are three power states for each managed ADSL interface
   operating in the G.lite mode.  L0 is power on, L1 is power on but
   reduced and L2 is power off.  Power state cannot be configured by an
   operator but it can be viewed via the ifOperStatus object for the
   managed ADSL interface.  The value of the object ifOperStatus is set
   to down(2) if the ADSL interface is in power state L2 and is set to
   up(1) if the ADSL line interface is in power state L0 or L1.

        An ADSL line power state, if the interface is operating in the
   G.lite mode, can also be monitored by the adslLineGlitePowerState
   object defined in the ADSL Line Extension table.  The value of the
   object enumerates the three power states attainable by the managed
   interface.

   7.2.3 Fast Retrain Parameters

        Section 7.4.15 of ITU G.997.1 specifies fast retrain parameters.
   Fast retrain parameters include two counters: fast retrain count and
   failed fast retrain count.  These two counters have been added to all
   performance tables.

INTERNET-DRAFT          ADSL Line Extension MIB             June 5, 2000


   7.2.4 Counters for Severe Error Second-line and Unavailable Second

        Section 7.2.1.1.7 and section 7.2.1.1.9 specify two counters
   that are not covered by the ADSL Line MIB [10].  These two counters
   (severe error seconds-line and unavailable seconds) are added to all
   the performance tables.

        Unavailable seconds counts cumulative number of seconds in which
   the interface was unavailable during the measured period.  This
   counter does not include the seconds in which unavailability was
   caused solely by fast retrains and failed fast retrins.  Fast
   retrains and failed fast retrains are considered to be part of the
   normal network operation and thus are not counted as unavailable
   errors.

   7.2.5 Alternative profile configuration for the Dual line mode
   interface

        This object is used only when the interface (for the ADSL line
   or channel) is configured as dual mode, that is, the object
   adslLineTransAtucConfig is configued with one or more full-rate modes
   and one or more Lite modes.

        The object adslLineConfProfile defined in ADSL-MIB [10] is used
   as the primary full-rate profile.  The newly added object in this MIB
   module, adslLineConfProfileDualLite is used to describe or configure
   the Lite profile.  Note that if one or more full-rate modes are
   configured, or only lite modes are configured, only the original
   full-rate profile is needed.  The dual-mode profile object is only
   needed when both full-rate and lite profiles are needed.

        If the static profile is used, the profile name is the ifIndex
   ASCII string plus the differentiator string appended to the end of
   the static profile name.  For example, for interface 100, the object
   adslLineConfProfile is set by the agent to be "100Full" and the
   object adslLineConfProfileDualLite is set to be "100Lite".

   10.  Security Considerations

      1) Blocking unauthorized access to the ADSL MIB via the element
      management system is outside the scope of this document. It should
   be
      noted that access to the MIB permits the unauthorized entity to
      modify the profiles (sect 6.4) such that both subscriber service
   and
      network operations can be interfered with. Subscriber service can
   be
      altered by modifying any of a number of service characteristics
   such
      as rate partitioning and maximum transmission rates. Network
      operations can be impacted by modification of trap thresholds such
   as
      SNR margins.

      2) There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may be
      considered to contain sensitive information.  In particular, the
      certain objects may be considered sensitive in many environments,
      since it would allow an intruder to obtain information about which
      vendor's equipment is in use on the network.  Therefore, it may be
      important in some environments to control read access to these

      objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these object
   when
      sending them over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP
      provide features for such a secure environment.

      SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the
      network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
      there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
      access and GET (read) the objects in this MIB.  It is recommended
      that the implementors consider the security features as provided
   by
      the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of the User-based
      Security Model RFC 2574 [21] and the View-based Access Control
   Model
      RFC 2575 [23] is recommended.

      It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
      entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
      configured to give access to those objects only to those
   principals
      (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.

      3) ADSL layer connectivity from the ATU-R will permit the
   subscriber
      to manipulate both the ADSL link directly and the AOC/EOC channels
      for their own loop.  For example,  unchecked or unfiltered
      fluctuations initiated by the subscriber could generate sufficient
      traps to potentially overwhelm either the management interface to
   the
      network or the element manager.  Other attacks affecting the ATU-R
      portions of the MIB may also be possible.
