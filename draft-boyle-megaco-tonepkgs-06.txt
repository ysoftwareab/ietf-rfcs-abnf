              Supplemental Tones Packages for Megaco/H.248 
 
 
Status of this Memo 
 
   This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with 
   all provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026 [1].  
    
   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering 
   Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups. Note that 
   other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-
   Drafts. Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of 
   six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other 
   documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet- Drafts 
   as reference material or to cite them other than as "work in 
   progress."

1. Abstract 
    
   This document provides proposed definitions for several supplemental 
   packages for Megaco/H.248. These packages address support of 
   functionality for basic and enhanced telephony services. 
    
2. Conventions used in this document 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [2]. 
    
 
3. Packages and Megaco 
    
   The packages defined in this draft are designed as discussed in 
   Section 12 of RFC 3015 [4].  Packages allow finite and expandable 
   extensions of the Megaco/H.248 protocol, allowing adaptation to a 
   wide range of applications, without requiring change to the 
   definition of the protocol itself.  The packages defined here allow 
   a wide range of telephony services to be realized by the 
   Megaco/H.248 protocol.

   Note that several tones packages defined by ITU-T Recommendation 
   Q.1950 [3] for use under the CBC protocol are suitable for use under 
   the Megaco/H.248 protocol as well.  Those packages are: 
    
   * Basic Call Progress Tones Generator with Directionality Package 
   * Expanded Call Progress Tones Generator Package 
   * Basic Services Tones Generation Package 
   * Expanded Services Tones Generation Package 
   * Intrusion Tones Generation Package 
   * Business Tones Generation Package 
    
   For more information regarding these packages, please see ITU-T 
   Recommendation Q.1950 [3].

                The tone direction indicates in which direction the 
                signal shall proceed with respect to the center of the 
                context. "Internal" denotes that the signal shall 
                proceed toward the center of the context from the 
                termination, while "external" denotes that the signal 
                shall proceed toward the edge of the context.  "Both" 
                indicates that the signal shall proceed in both 
                directions. Unspecified tone direction shall default to 
                "external". Note that using the playtone signal in 
                package tonegen to generate this signal will prevent 
                the capability to use the directionality parameter.

                signal shall proceed with respect to the center of the 
                context. "Internal" denotes that the signal shall 
                proceed toward the center of the context from the 
                termination, while "external" denotes that the signal 
                shall proceed toward the edge of the context.  "Both" 
                indicates that the signal shall proceed in both 
                directions. Unspecified tone direction shall default to 
                "external". Note that using the playtone signal in 
                package tonegen to generate this signal will prevent 
                the capability to use the directionality parameter.
