Internet draft       SIP-H.323 Interworking Requirements    10 July 2000

1.  Introduction

This document describes the requirements for the logical entity known
as the interworking function (IWF) that will allow  the  interworking
between the SIP(Session Initiation Protocol) and H.323 networks..

2.  Terminology

In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
"SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1] and 
indicate requirement levels for the protocol.

3.  Definitions

3.1. H.323 Gatekeeper(GK)

This is an optional component in H.323 network. If it is present, it 
must perform the address translation, bandwidth control, admission 
control and zone management.

3.2. IWF(InterWorking Function)

It allows interworking between the H.323 and SIP system.

3.3. SIP Server 

This can be either SIP proxy or SIP redirect server.

3.4. Endpoint 

This is an entity from which the media originates or finally terminates.
This can either be H.323 terminal or SIP user agent.

3.5. Media switching fabric (MSF) 

This is an optional logical entity present in the IWF. If it is present,
it will perform the task of switching RTP from one logical port to 
other.

4. Functionality within the IWF

This section provides the functional requirements of the SIP-H.323
interworking function.

IWF can be an architecture in various ways. This may include the 
coexistence of H.323 Gatekeeper or SIP Servers with IWF. The location of
the H.323 GK and/or SIP server in conjunction with the IWF is a matter 
of implementation and not a protocol issue. There shall be no 

[Agrawal,Roy,Palawat,Johnston,Agboh,Wang,Singh and Schulzrinne] [Page 3]




Internet draft       SIP-H.323 Interworking Requirements    10 July 2000



assumptions made for the optional elements and components present in 
either H.323 or SIP networks. The solution provided here shall work for 
a minimum configuration required for both protocols. There may be 
recommendations for other configurations, which include optional 
components. 

For instance, H.323 Gatekeeper is not a mandatory component of H.323 
network. So, there shall be no assumptions made for the basic 
interworking which involves H.323 Gatekeeper either co-located with the 
IWF or existing separately  in the H.323 zone. IWF will belong to both 
SIP and H.323 networks. 

The introduction of IWF redundancy in the network is left for further
discussion.

Therefore, an IWF may  contain the following functions: 

a) Call sequence mapping.

b) Address resolution.

c) Terminal Capability transactions.  

d) Opening and closing of media channels.

e) Mapping media algorithms for H.323 and SIP network.  

f) Call resource reservation and release.  

g) Ability to provide the state of a call.

h) Call state machine.

i) Mid Call signal processing.

j) Service Interoperability Logic.

There should not be  processing of the media data at IWF. It is assumed 
that both H.323 and SIP network uses RTP as a transport for carrying 
media. In most of the cases RTP should be flowing directly between the 
endpoints. Even if the media from one endpoint terminates at IWF in 
special scenario, the assumption is made that this may be simply 
switched to another endpoint by a media switching fabric present in the 
IWF.

We are going to  use two phases in defining the interworking standard.
The first phase will define the basic call establishment and

[Agrawal,Roy,Palawat,Johnston,Agboh,Wang,Singh and Schulzrinne] [Page 4]




Internet draft       SIP-H.323 Interworking Requirements    10 July 2000

termination.  The second phase will include some optional, advanced 
features, and services.  Both phases have to meet the general 
requirements specified in the following sections.

5.  Pre-Call Requirements

The IWF function may have a table of reference for lookup to resolve the
corresponding H.323 and SIP addresses to IP addresses. This may be 
accomplished by using the capabilities of either H.323 Gatekeepers or 
SIP servers. Since H.323 Gatekeeper and SIP Server are not mandatory 
components of H.323 and SIP systems respectively, the IWF function may 
keep within itself the address resolution information, which may be 
updated by using the H.323 Gatekeeper, SIP Server, or any other 
database.

5.1.  Registration with H.323 Gatekeeper

This is done to give the information about SIP side extensions of IWF to
H.323 Gatekeeper if the latter is present in the network. This 
information may be used by H.323 Gatekeeper to direct a call whose 
destination is in the SIP network. The registration information to the 
H.323 Gatekeeper may be updated at any time. The way in which IWF gets 
the information about the SIP side extension is for further study.

IWF can register with one H.323 Gatekeeper only. Registration with 
multiple gatekeepers by the IWF is for further study.

The SIP user agent may register with the H.323 Gatekeeper via the IWF. 
To achieve this, the IWF should create an H.323 alias address for the 
SIP 
User agent and bind its own transport address with this alias address  
during registration. 

5.2.  Registration with SIP Server

This is done to give the information about H.323 side extensions of the 
IWF to the SIP Server if the latter is present in the SIP network. This 
information may be used by the SIP server to direct  a call whose 
destination is in the H.323 network. The way in which IWF gets the 
information  about the H.323 side extensions is for further study. 

Since SIP does not require a gateway  for registration to the SIP 
server, the IWF may register itself to the SIP server using TRIP[6]. The
IWF may register itself as a SIP User agent specifying the H.323 side 
extensions in the REGISTER message. This IWF behavior is for further 
discussion.

IWF may register with one or many SIP servers. This is for subsequent 
study.

[Agrawal,Roy,Palawat,Johnston,Agboh,Wang,Singh and Schulzrinne] [Page 5]




Internet draft       SIP-H.323 Interworking Requirements    10 July 2000

6. General Interworking Requirements

The IWF shall use the H.323 Version 2.0 [5] and SIP Ver 2.0 [2]. The IWF
should handle all mandatory features of H.323 Version 2.0 as well as SIP
Version 2.0. It should also provide backward compatibility for earlier 
versions.

The IWF shall provide the seamless interworking of the two protocols. 
The functioning of IWF should not involve any modification to the H.323 
and SIP protocols, but may involve specific profiles of these protocols.

6.1. Basic call Requirements

6.1.1. General Requirements

The IWF  should:

a) Provide default settings, so that the transactions will only be for a
change or non-default parameters. The default parameters for such 
setting should be identified. 

b) Release any call related resource on the detection of call 
deactivation. SIP Session timers may be used for this purpose in SIP 
side. However the methods for detecting call deactivation are for 
further study.

6.1.2. Address Resolution

The IWF should:

a) Support all the addressing schemes of both H.323 and SIP protocol.

b) Register itself to H.323 Gatekeeper and SIP Server if they are 
present in the Network.

The IWF may:

a) Have a look-up table for resolving the addresses. This may be updated
from the H.323 GK and SIP server.

b) Use LDAP or X.500 for keeping address resolution information.

c) Use DNS for address resolution.

d) Use TRIP

6.1.3. Call with H.323 GK 

When an H.323 GK is present in the network, the IWF should:

[Agrawal,Roy,Palawat,Johnston,Agboh,Wang,Singh and Schulzrinne] [Page 6]




Internet draft       SIP-H.323 Interworking Requirements    10 July 2000

a) Resolve addresses with the help of H.323 GK.

b) Register itself to forward the SIP extensions supported on SIP side 
of IWF.

c) Not be registered with two different H.323 Gatekeepers. This is left 
for further discussion.

The IWF may:

a) Update the newly added SIP extensions to H.323 Gatekeeper. This is 
left for further discussion.

b) Support a SIP user agent to register to a H.323 GK

6.1.4. Call with SIP Server

When a SIP Server is present in the network, the IWF should:

a) Resolve addresses with the help of SIP Server.

The IWF may:

a) Register itself with SIP Server (e.g., using TRIP [6]) to forward the
H.323 extensions supported on the H.323 side of IWF.

b) Register with many SIP servers. This is left for further discussion.

c) Update the newly added H.323 extensions to SIP Server. This is left 
for further discussion.

d) Support a H.323 endpoint (EP) to register to a SIP Server

6.1.5. Call with both H.323 GK and SIP Servers 

All the requirements of Sections 6.1.3 and 6.1.4 will be met for this 
case. 

6.1.6. Capability negotiation 

The IWF should:

a) Not make any assumptions about the capabilities of either SIP user 
agent or H.323 terminal. However, it may indicate a default capability 
of H.323 terminal or SIP user agent even before exchanging capability 
with H.323(using H.245) and SIP (using SDP).  This default capability 
follows the mandatory capability requirements as defined by the 
respective protocols. For example, G.711 is mandatory for higher 
bandwidth networks of H.323.

[Agrawal,Roy,Palawat,Johnston,Agboh,Wang,Singh and Schulzrinne] [Page 7]




Internet draft       SIP-H.323 Interworking Requirements   10 July 2000

b) Send all the capability descriptors of H.323 and SDP descriptors of 
SIP in the best possible way to each other. The algorithm for finding 
out the maximum mapping of capability descriptors with the corresponding
SDP is left for further discussion. 

c) Provide mapping for common audio formats supported in H.323 with the 
RTP/AVP formats.

The IWF may:

a) Use OPTIONS message on the SIP side to provide capability 
negotiations.

b) Support re-negotiation of media capabilities.

c) Provide mapping for common video/data formats supported in H.323 with
the RTP/AVP formats.

6.1.7. Opening of logical channels

The IWF should:

a) Provide support for seamless exchange of messages for opening, 
reopening, changing and closing of media channels during a call. The 
procedures for opening, reopening, closing, and changing the existing 
media sessions during a call are for further discussion.
 
b) Open the channels between the endpoints wherever possible. If this is
not possible, then it can optionally be opened at the media switching 
fabric of IWF.

c) Support unidirectional, symmetric bi-directional, and asymmetric bi-
directional opening of channels.

The IWF may:  

a) Respond to the mode request and/or to the request for reopening and 
changing an existing logical channel. .

b) Support the flow control of H.323.

6.1.8. Handle Media transmission and reception 

The IWF shall:

a)  Not process any RTP data.

6.2. Requirements for support of fast connect procedures 


[Agrawal,Roy,Palawat,Johnston,Agboh,Wang,Singh and Schulzrinne] [Page 8]




Internet draft       SIP-H.323 Interworking Requirements    10 July 2000

The IWF shall support the fast Start element in H.323.

6.3. Requirements for support of H.245 tunneling

The IWF shall support the H.245 tunneling in Setup message.

6.4. Requirements for support of pregranted ARQ 

The IWF shall support the pre-granted ARQ. In this case, the IWF may do 
the address resolution from H.323 GK using LRQ/LCF exchange.

6.5. Requirements for support of overlapped sending 

The IWF shall support the overlapped sending of dialed digits by using 
the INFO method in SIP and Q.931 Setup, Setup Ack and Information 
Message in H.323. The support for inband digit transfer (using RTP) in 
IWF is out of scope.

The IWF shall support the transfer of digits during a call by using INFO
method in SIP and UserInputIndication in H.245(H.323).

6.6. Requirements for support of early H.245 

This is left for further discussion.

6.7. Requirements for H.323 trunking between SIP networks.

This is left for next phase.

6.8. Requirements for SIP trunking between H.323 networks.

This is left for next phase.

7.  Transport 

7.1. Assumptions made for underlying network 

7.1.1 It should support both the TCP and UDP; i.e. both reliable and 
non-reliable delivery of messages are supported. 

7.1.2 The H.323 and SIP system network can be anywhere. There are no
assumptions for the closeness of these networks.

7.1.3 The network does not assure quality-of-service (QOS). The network 
that supports QOS will be addressed in the next phase.





[Agrawal,Roy,Palawat,Johnston,Agboh,Wang,Singh and Schulzrinne] [Page 9]




Internet draft       SIP-H.323 Interworking Requirements    10 July 2000

7.1.4 Signalling messages have no priority over other messages.

7.1.5 The Support for H.323Annex E (H.323 signaling over UDP) is 
optional.

7.2. Media Transport Requirements 



7.2.1 It is assumed that both H.323 and SIP network use RTP for carrying
media. If this is not the case, then a media gateway may be required.

7.2.2 Support for large fan-out.

8. Mapping between SIP and H.323 

8.1. General Procedures

8.1.1. A clear mapping between SIP and H.323 messages shall be provided 
which reflects similar meaning in call sequence.

8.1.2. Call message sequence shall be maintained in both directions.

8.1.3. The IWF shall not on its own take any decision related to basic 
functionality of a call like call setup and call teardown etc.

8.1.4. The messages that do not have a match on the other side should be
terminated on the IWF, and IWF should take the necessary action on them 
e.g SIP standard allows a SIP UA to silently discard an ACK for a non-
existent call leg. 

8.1.5. In case the IWF is required to generate a message on its own in 
any of the sides, IWF should use the pre-configured default values for 
the parameters.

8.1.6. The information elements of the respective messages are to be 
converted as follows:

a) The contents of connection-specific information elements (such as 
Call Reference Value on H.323) shall be converted to respective 
information as required by SIP or SDP (such as session ID, call leg and 
Call-ID.)

b) Information elements that are not in use on the H.323 side shall be 
generated by the IWF as required by the SIP protocol and vice versa.

c) The SIP data fields shall be converted into the corresponding ASN.1 
user-user information element structure. The user-user information 
element structure shall be generated according to specifications in 

[Agrawal,Roy,Palawat,Johnston,Agboh,Wang,Singh and Schulzrinne][Page 10]




Internet draft       SIP-H.323 Interworking Requirements    10 July 2000

Recommendation H.225.0 version 2.0 and H.245 version 4.0.

8.2 Call Signalling (H.225.0) and SIP Call Signalling

8.2.1. The IWF shall conform to the call signalling procedures 
recommended for the SIP side independent of the H.323 side.

8.2.2. The IWF shall conform to the call signalling procedures 
recommended for the H.323 side independent of the SIP side.

8.2.3. The IWF shall terminate the Q.931 Call Signalling Channel between
an H.323 endpoint or H.323 Gatekeeper (in case of GK routed signalling) 
and the IWF on one hand and the call signalling (if any) between the IWF
and the SIP endpoint on the other side.

8.2.4. The IWF shall terminate the RAS Channel between H.323 Gatekeeper 
(if any) and IWF.

8.2.5. Messages for supplementary services (FACILITY, NOTIFY, and the 
INFORMATION messages) in H.323 side may be processed by the IWF only if 
the service is supported.

8.3 H.323 Call Control (H.245) and SIP Call Control (SDP)

IWF should try to map the H.245 and SDP to the maximum extent. The list 
of messages that can be mapped is for further study.

8.4 H.323 media codec to/from SIP media formats

8.4.1. The IWF should provide invisible support for all audio algorithms
commonly supported by both ITU and IANA.

8.4.2. The IWF may provide invisible support for all video/data 
algorithms commonly supported by both ITU and IANA.

8.4.3. Handling of dynamic payload types is for further discussion.

8.5. Call sequence

The call sequence on both sides should be maintained in such a way that 
neither H.323 terminal nor SIP UA is aware of the IWF presence. The IWF 
should provide seamless interworking between the call flows of the two 
protocols. The IWF will not make any modifications to the normal call 
flows of either protocols .The messages and parameters which do not have
direct mapping on the other side are to be generated by the IWF with 
default parameters in most cases. In brief, the H.323 endpoint should 
not be aware of the fact it is calling a SIP endpoint and vice versa.



[Agrawal,Roy,Palawat,Johnston,Agboh,Wang,Singh and Schulzrinne][Page 11]




Internet draft       SIP-H.323 Interworking Requirements    10 July 2000

9. State Machine Requirements

The state machine for IWF will follow the following general guidelines:

9.1. Unexpected messages in a particular state shall be treated as 
"Error" messages.

9.2. All messages which do not change the state shall be treated as "Non
triggering or Informational" messages.

9.3. All messages which expect a change in state shall be treated as
"Triggering" messages.

For each state, there should be guidelines that classify all possible 
messages into the above three categories. Apart from this, it is 
required to specify the processing i.e. action to be taken on the 
content of the messages in the state machine.This will result in a table
given below as an illustration.

State : Idle

Possible Messages         Message Category   Action         Next state

All RAS Msg.              Triggering         Add Reg.Info.  WaitForSetup
All Q.931 Msg.            Non Triggering
All H.245 Msg.            Error 
All Msg. from SIP side 

10. Service Interoperability Requirements

There should be a set of interoperation scenarios and application 
priorities. These should be defined from a service provider's point of 
view so that the resulting solution can be used in a globally deployable
network that accommodates both SIP and H.323. This is an item for the 
second phase, hence it is for further study.

11. Security Requirements

A simple security scheme should be enabled in the IWF. In this scheme 
the IWF will accept requests from a pre-configured set of SIP Server, 
SIP EP, H.323 EP, or H.323 GKs only and it will reject all other 
requests. 

All other security requirements are for further discussion. Common 
security mechanisms between the two protocols are required to be 
identified in the next phase. 

Assumptions for the endpoints:


[Agrawal,Roy,Palawat,Johnston,Agboh,Wang,Singh and Schulzrinne][Page 12]




Internet draft       SIP-H.323 Interworking Requirements    10 July 2000

11.1. All endpoints trying to use IWF are authorized with the respective
H.323 Gatekeepers and SIP servers if they are present in the network. 
This is left for further discussion.

11.2. All endpoints trying to make a call using IWF are respectively
permitted to do so from H.323 Gatekeeper and SIP server if it is 
present in the network.

Required for IWF:

11.3 Procedures for preventing denial of service security attacks.

11.4 Maintaining persistent data for authorized endpoints for future 
verifications.

12. Activities planned for next phase

12.16 The way in which the H.323 side of the IWF gets the information 
about the SIP side extension and vice versa for registration purpose

12.17 Registration with multiple gatekeepers or SIP servers by the IWF

12.18 Registration of the IWF itself as a SIP User Agent specifying the 
H.323 side extension in the REGISTER Message

12.19 Methods for detecting call deactivation by the IWF

12.20 The algorithm and list of messages for finding out the maximum 
mapping of capability descriptors with corresponding SDP by the IWF

12.21 Support of early H.245 in H.323 by the IWF

12.22 Interoperation scenarios and application priorities for the 
globally deployable network that accommodates both H.323 and SIP

12.23 Sovereignty over the IWF and relationship between the IWF (H.323 
and SIP side) and Border Element of H.323

13. Examples and Scenarios

Here are some examples of call scenarios that will show primarily the 
input and output signaling messages of the IWF for interworking between 
SIP and H.323. The important point is that the IWF will perform the 
translation between the signaling messages of SIP and H.323. However, it
is not addressed how the mapping will be done in this contribution 
although it is shown what should be the output signaling message of the 
IWF for a given input signaling message in the IWF.

In performing the mapping, the IWF may have to face the following
situations:

a) It may  appear that there can be one-to-one mapping between the
signaling messages; the IWF will perform the translation accordingly.

b) All parameters used in each signaling message on one side may not 
match exactly the corresponding signaling message of the other side. In 
this situation, some manipulations need to be done by the IWF so that
an agreed-upon standard can be created based on common understanding 
although all parameters do not exactly match.

c) For a given signaling message of a given protocol, there may not be a
corresponding signaling message of the other protocol that may appear to
be equivalent. The IWF needs to create a mapping between the signaling 
messages or generate error messages based on common understanding of an 
agreed upon standard.

Internet draft       SIP-H.323 Interworking Requirements    10 July 2000

Items a, b, and c as stated above are very critical to creating the  
interoperability standard between H.323 and SIP; therefore, we would 
like to address these in separate contributions. It may be mentioned 
that many problems in those areas have already been addressed in the 
interworking between SIP/SDP[2] and H.323 document [1]. However, we have
addressed the configurations for call scenarios and the input-output 
messages of the IWF that are required to provide interoperability 
between SIP and H.323.

Following are the different configurations for the call scenarios:

13.1. Basic Configuration

H.323 EP  ---- IWF ---- SIP EP

13.2. Advanced Configurations

13.2.1. Calls using H.323 GK

H.323 EP ---- H.323 GK ---- IWF ---- SIP EP

13.2.2. Calls using SIP Server

H.323 EP ---- IWF ---- SIP Server ---- SIP EP

13.2.3. Calls using both H.323 GK and SIP Server

H.323 EP ---- H.323 GK ---- IWF ---- SIP Server ---- SIP EP

13.2.4 SIP trunking between H.323 Networks

H.323 EP ------IWF-------SIP Network ------IWF---------H.323 EP

13.2.5 H.323 trunking between SIP Networks

SIP EP --------IWF-------H.323 Network --------IWF---------SIP EP

The different call scenarios for the above configurations are:

a) Simple Call from H.323 terminal to SIP terminal.		

b) Call from H.323 terminal to SIP terminal using H.245 tunneling.

c) Call from H.323 terminal to SIP terminal using early H.245.

d) Call from H.323 terminal to SIP terminal using fast connect 
procedure.

e) Call from H.323 terminal to SIP terminal using overlapped sending.

Internet draft       SIP-H.323 Interworking Requirements    10 July 2000

f) Call from H.323 terminal to SIP terminal using pre granted ARQ (for 
configurations having H.323 GK).

g) Simple call from SIP terminal to H.323 terminal.

h) Call from SIP terminal to H.323 terminal using H.245 tunneling.

i) Call from SIP terminal to H.323 terminal using early H.245.

j) Call from SIP terminal to H.323 terminal using fast connect 
procedure.

k) Call from SIP terminal to H.323 terminal using overlapped sending.

l) Call from SIP terminal to H.323 terminal using pregranted ARQ (for 
configuration having H.323 GK).

m) Call from a SIP terminal to SIP terminal using H.323 trunking between 
two IWFs.

n) Call from a H.323 terminal to H.323 terminal using SIP trunking 
between two IWFs.

Some call flow examples for the different configurations and call 
scenarios are given below:

i) Simple calls from H.323 terminal to SIP terminal using configuration
of 13.1
