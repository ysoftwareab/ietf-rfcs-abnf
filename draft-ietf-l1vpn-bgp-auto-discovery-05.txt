Internet-Draft  BGP Auto-Discovery for L1VPNs          May 2008 
    

 

Abstract           

   The purpose of this document is to define a BGP-based auto-discovery 
   mechanism for Layer-1 VPNs (L1VPNs). The auto-discovery mechanism for 
   L1VPNs allows the provider network devices to dynamically discover 
   the set of PEs having ports attached to CE members of the same VPN. 
   That information is necessary for completing the signaling phase of 
   L1VPN connections. One main objective of a L1VPN auto-discovery 
   mechanism is to support the "single-end provisioning" model, where 
   addition of a new port to a given L1VPN would involve configuration 
   changes only on the PE that has this port and on the CE that is 
   connected to the PE via this port.  

1. Introduction        

   The purpose of this document is to define a BGP-based auto-discovery 
   mechanism for Layer-1 VPNs (L1VPNs) [L1VPN-FRMK]. The auto-discovery 
   mechanism for L1VPNs allows the provider network devices to 
   dynamically discover the set of PEs having ports attached to CE 
   members of the same VPN. That information is necessary for completing 
   the signaling phase of L1VPN connections. One main objective of a 
   L1VPN auto-discovery mechanism is to support the "single-end 
   provisioning" model, where addition of a new port to a given L1VPN 
   would involve configuration changes only on the PE that has this port 
   and on the CE that is connected to the PE via this port.           

    
   The auto-discovery mechanism proceeds by having a PE advertise to 
   other PEs, at a minimum, its own IP address and the list of <private 
   address, provider address> tuples local to that PE. Once that 
   information is received, the remote PEs will identify the list of VPN 
   members they have in common with the advertising PE, and use the 
   information carried within the discovery mechanism to perform address 
   resolution during the signaling phase of Layer-1 VPN connections. 

   Figure 1 highlights the network reference for using BGP-based auto-
   discovery mechanism for Layer-1 VPNs. For the purpose of auto-
   discovery mechanism, BGP is running only on the provider network. The 
   PEs maintain per VPN information tables called Port Information Table 
   (PIT) related to <private address, provider address> information. 
   More information on the PIT tables is described in section 2.

                   Figure 1 BGP auto-discovery for L1VPN 

   [L1VPN-FRMK] describes two modes of operation for a L1VPN: the basic 
   mode and the enhanced mode. This document describes an auto-discovery 
   mechanism for the basic mode only.   

2. Procedures  

   In the context of L1VPNs, a CE is connected to a PE via one or more 
   ports, where each port may consist of one or more channels or sub-
   channels. Each port on a CE that connects the CE to a PE has an 
   identifier that is unique within that L1VPN (but need not be unique 
   across several L1VPNs). We refer to this identifier as the customer 
   port identifier (CPI). Each port on a PE also has an identifier that 
   is unique within the provider network. We refer to this identifier as 
   the provider port identifier (PPI). Note that IP addresses used for 
   CPIs or PPIs could be either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.     

   For each L1VPN that has at least one port configured on a PE, the PE 
   maintains a Port Information Table (PIT). A PIT contains a list of 
   <CPI, PPI> tuples for all the ports within its L1VPN. Note that a PIT 
   may also hold routing information (for example when CPIs are learnt 
   using a routing protocol).   

   A PIT on a given PE is populated with two types of information. 

   - Information related to the CEs' ports attached to the ports on the 
   PE. This information could be locally configured at the PE or could 
   be received from the CEs. 

   - Information received from other PEs through the auto-discovery 
   mechanism.

Internet-Draft  BGP Auto-Discovery for L1VPNs          May 2008 
    

   We refer to the former as local information, and to the latter as 
   remote information. Propagation of local information to other PEs is 
   accomplished by using BGP multiprotocol extensions [RFC4760]. To 
   restrict the flow of this information to only the PITs within a given 
   L1VPN, we use BGP route filtering based on the Route Target Extended 
   Community [BGP-COMM], as follows.       

   Each PIT on a PE is configured with one or more Route Target 
   Communities, called "export Route Targets", that are used for tagging 
   the local information when it is exported into the provider's BGP. 
   The granularity of such tagging could be as fine as a single <CPI, 
   PPI> pair. In addition, each PIT on a PE is configured (at 
   provisioning time) with one or more Route Target Communities, called 
   "import Route Targets", that restrict the set of routes that could be 
   imported from provider's BGP into the PIT to only the routes that 
   have at least one of these Communities.  

   When a service provider adds a new L1VPN port to a particular PE (at 
   provisioning time), this port is associated at provisioning time with 
   a PIT on that PE, and this PIT is associated (again at provisioning 
   time) with that L1VPN.     

   Note that since the protocol used to populate a PIT with remote 
   information is BGP, since BGP works across multiple autonomous 
   systems, it follows that the mechanism described in this document 
   could support L1VPNs that span multiple autonomous systems.  

   Although multi-AS L1VPNs are currently out of scope for the Basic 
   Mode, the mechanisms defined in this document appear to be easily 
   applicable to a multi-AS scenario should such a need arise in the 
   future. At that time additional work may be required to examine 
   various aspects including security. 

    

3. Carrying L1VPN information in BGP       

   The <CPI, PPI> mapping is carried using the Multiprotocol Extensions 
   to BGP [RFC4760]. [RFC4760] defines the format of two BGP attributes, 
   MP_REACH_NLRI and MP_UNREACH_NLRI that can be used to announce and 
   withdraw the announcement of reachability information. We introduce a 
   new subsequent address family identifier, called Layer-1 VPN auto-
   discovery information (to be assigned by the IANA), and also a new 
   NLRI format for carrying the CPI and PPI information. 

   One or more <PPI, CPI> tuples could be carried in the above mentioned 
   BGP attributes.  

   The format of the NLRI is described in figure 2.

   Note that the encoding of the auto-discovery information is described 
   in [L1VPN-BM] and note also that if the value of the Length of the 
   Next Hop field (of the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute) is 4, then the Next 
   Hop contains an IPv4 address. If this value is 16, then the Next Hop 
   contains an IPv6 address. 

4. Carrying L1VPN Traffic Engineering Information in BGP      

   In addition to reachability information, the auto-discovery mechanism 
   MAY carry Traffic Engineering information used for the purpose of 
   egress path selection. For example a PE may learn the switching 
   capability and the maximum LSP bandwidth of remote L1VPN interfaces 
   from the remote PEs. This document uses the BGP Traffic Engineering 
   Attribute [BGP-TE-ATTRIBUTE] to carry such information.  

5. Scalability  

             
   Recall that the Service Provider network consists of (a) PEs, (b) BGP 
   Route Reflectors, (c) P nodes (which are neither PEs nor Route 
   Reflectors), and, in the case of multi-provider VPNs, (d) ASBRs.  

   A PE router, unless it is a Route Reflector, does not retain L1VPN-
   related information unless it has at least one VPN with an Import 
   Target identical to one of the VPN-related information Route Target 
   attributes. If a PE does not have a VPN with a matching Import Route 
   Target it MUST then discard received l1VPN information.  Inbound 
   filtering MUST be used to cause such information to be discarded.  If 
   a new Import Target is later added to one of the PE's VPNs (a "VPN 
   Join" operation), it MUST then acquire the VPN-related information it 
   previously has discarded.     

   In this case the refresh mechanism described in [BGP-RFSH] MUST be 
   used. The outbound route filtering mechanism of [BGP-ORF], [BGP-CONS] 
   can also be used to advantage to make the filtering more dynamic.  

   Similarly, if a particular Import Target is no longer present in any 
   of a PE's VPN (as a result of one or more "VPN Prune" operations), 
   the PE MAY discard all VPN-related information which, as a result, no

Internet-Draft  BGP Auto-Discovery for L1VPNs          May 2008 
    

   longer have any of the PE's VPN Import Targets as one of their Route 
   Target attributes.      

   Note that VPN Join and Prune operations are non-disruptive, and do 
   not require any BGP connections to be brought down, as long as the 
   refresh mechanism of [BGP-RFSH] is used.       

   As a result of these distribution rules, no one PE ever needs to 
   maintain all routes for all L1VPNs; this is an important scalability 
   consideration.        

   Route reflectors can be partitioned among VPNs so that each partition 
   carries routes for only a subset of the L1VPNs supported by the 
   Service Provider. Thus no single route reflector is required to 
   maintain VPN-related information for all VPNs.  

   For inter-provider VPNs, if multi-hop EBGP is used, then the ASBRs 
   need not maintain and distribute VPN-related information at all. P 
   routers do not maintain any VPN-related information.        

   As a result, no single component within the Service Provider network 
   has to maintain all the VPN-related information for all the VPNs. So 
   the total capacity of the network to support increasing numbers of 
   VPNs is not limited by the capacity of any individual component.   

   An important consideration to remember is that one may have any 
   number of INDEPENDENT BGP systems carrying VPN-related information. 
   This is unlike the case of the Internet, where the Internet BGP 
   system MUST carry all the Internet routes. Thus one significant (but 
   perhaps subtle) distinction between the use of BGP for the Internet 
   routing and the use of BGP for distributing VPN-related information, 
   as described in this document is that the former is not amenable to 
   partition, while the latter is. 

6. Security Considerations           

   This document describes a BGP-based auto-discovery mechanism which 
   enables a PE that attaches to a particular L1VPN to discover the set 
   of other PE routers that attach to the same VPN.  Each PE router that 
   is attached to a given VPN uses BGP to advertise that fact. Other PE 
   routers which attach to the same VPN receive these BGP 
   advertisements. This allows that set of PEs to discover each other. 
   Note that a PE will not always receive these advertisements directly 
   from the remote PEs; the advertisements can be received from 
   "intermediate" BGP speakers.  

   It is of critical importance that a particular PE MUST NOT be 
   "discovered" to be attached to a particular VPN unless that PE really 
   is attached to that VPN, and indeed is properly authorized to be 
   attached to that VPN.  If any arbitrary node on the Internet could 
   start sending these BGP advertisements, and if those advertisements 
   were able to reach the PE nodes, and if the PE nodes accepted those

Internet-Draft  BGP Auto-Discovery for L1VPNs          May 2008 
    

   advertisements, then anyone could add any site to any L1VPN.  Thus 
   the auto-discovery procedures described here presuppose that a 
   particular PE trusts its BGP peers to be who they appear to be, and 
   further that it can trust those peers to be properly securing their 
   local attachments.  (That is, a PE MUST trust that its peers are 
   attached to, and are authorized to be attached to, the L1VPNs to 
   which they claim to be attached.)    

   If a particular remote PE is a BGP peer of the local PE, then the BGP 
   authentication procedures of RFC 2385 SHOULD be used to ensure that 
   the remote PE is who it claims to be, i.e., that it is a PE that is 
   trusted.  

   If a particular remote PE is not a BGP peer of the local PE, then the 
   information it is advertising is being distributed to the local PE 
   through a chain of BGP speakers.  The local PE MUST trust that its 
   peers only accept information from peers that they trust in turn, and 
   this trust relation MUST be transitive.  BGP does not provide a way 
   to determine that any particular piece of received information 
   originated from a BGP speaker that was authorized to advertise that 
   particular piece of information.  Hence the procedures of this 
   document MUST be used only in environments where adequate trust 
   relationships exist among the BGP speakers (such as the case of using 
   the auto-discovery mechanism within a single provider network). 

    
7. IANA Considerations  

             
   This document requires assignment of a new SAFI, called Layer-1 VPN 
   auto-discovery information (see Section 3). This assignment has to be 
   done from the Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) registry 
   using the Standards Action allocation procedures. Suggested value is 
   69.
