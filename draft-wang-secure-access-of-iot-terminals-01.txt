              draft-wang-secure-access-of-iot-terminals-01

Abstract

   It is difficult to supervise the great deal of Internet of Things
   (IoT) smart terminals which are widely distributed.  Furthermore, a
   large number of smart terminals (such as IP cameras, access control
   terminals, traffic cameras, etc.) running on the network have high
   security risks in access control.  This draft introduces the
   technical requirements for access management and control of IoT smart
   terminals, which is used to solve the problem of personate and
   illegal connection in the access process, and enables users to
   strengthen the control of devices and discover devices that is
   offline in time, so as to ensure the safety and stability of smart
   terminals in the access process.

1.  Introduction

   With the rapid development of the IoT and the IP-based communication
   system, a large number of terminals have been interconnected through
   the network.  Due to numerous branches of IoT network and the
   scattered distribution of smart terminals,it is difficult for human
   to supervise.  Therefore, how to ensure the full-time control and
   available of IoT network becomes a new problem.  A large number of
   smart terminals (such as IP cameras, access control terminals,
   traffic cameras and other dumb terminals), which running in the

   network, have a large security risk in terms of security access
   control.  With the further development of the convergence of IoT
   systems and information network, if IoT smart terminals are once used
   by hackers, it is easy for hackers to penetrate the whole network
   through IoT smart terminals, causing core business systems unable to
   work and a large amount of confidential information to leak, which
   will bring huge loss.  Therefore, the establishment of a perfect
   access control mechanism and application control mechanism of smart
   terminals is an important part of the IoT security system.

   This draft outlines the technical requirements for secure access and
   management of smart terminals in the IoT to address the security
   threats and challenges that exist in the access process of terminals.
   We discuss the networking structure of common IoT smart terminals in
   Section 2.  Security threats and challenges faced in the access
   process of IoT smart terminals in will be clarified in Section 3.  In
   Section 4, we review the guidelines and regulations related to the
   access of IoT terminals.  In Section 5, we present the requirements
   for secure access and management of IoT smart terminals and describes
   in detail.  This draft provides a reference for IoT security access
   and management .

2.  The Network Structure of IoT system

   In general, IoT smart terminals are connected to the network through
   IoT gateway, and then the data of terminals is reported to the
   application center through IoT gateway, which builds the complete
   network.

   The diagram of an IoT system is shown in the figure below.  In the
   perception layer, four types of IoT smart terminals form four
   subsystems, which are video monitoring subsystem, access control
   subsystem, alarm subsystem and intercom subsystem.  The smart
   terminals in each subsystem are different.  In the video monitoring
   subsystem, the main terminals are IP cameras and intelligent cameras
   for collecting video and image data.  In the access control
   subsystem, the main terminals are turnstiles and vehicle access
   control hosts for collecting vehicle information.  In the alarm
   subsystem, the main terminals are alarm hosts, alarm keyboards and
   wireless alarm hosts, which are used to set alarm policies, issue
   alarm warnings and report alarm events, etc.  In the intercom
   subsystem, its main terminals are intercom hosts and individual
   equipment, which are used to collect voice data.  Through this
   figure, we can know that in the IoT system, smart terminals are
   heterogeneous and complex, and the data are aggregated into the
   application layer through the transport layer, which greatly
   increases the difficulty of the application layer to control the
   terminals in the sensing layer.

3.  Security Threats and Challenges

   The main security threats and challenges in the process of accessing
   IoT smart terminals are as follows:

   1.  Illegal connection: By IoT smart terminals, illegal devices and
       hosts may access to the network for probing and attacking.  The
       application layer network may be invaded by smart terminals,
       which will lead to information leakage.

   2.  Personate connection: Wide distribution of IoT smart terminals
       and the public deployment environment make it easy for malicious
       devices to impersonate legitimate devices and upload fake data,
       which will lead to abnormal function of the devices and causes
       great damage to the security of IoT.

   3.  Devices offline: IoT smart terminals are numerous and very
       vulnerable when they suffer from physical attacks, network
       anomalies, power supply anomalies, and aging of device, which
       leads them to work offline.  However, offline devices are
       difficult to discover, causing the loss of some functions.

   4.  Devices management: There are many kinds of IoT smart terminals,
       and it is often not clear how many IoT smart terminals are in the
       whole IoT network and how many IoT smart terminals have security
       problems, which leads to unable to control IoT smart terminals
       and sort out device assets.

4.  Current Technology Level

   1.  On the access control of IoT,many control protocols applied to
       IoT smart terminals have been proposed, such as Zigbee [ZB], DALI
       [DALI], BACNET [BACNET], which do not contribute to the secure
       access of IoT devices.  The UPnP [ISOIEC23941] access protocol
       defines the access to IoT smart terminals, but does not consider
       the issue of secure access.

   2.  There are many specialized and generic security protocols being
       used in current IP-based deployments of IoT smart device
       applications.  For example, IPsec [RFC7296], TLS [RFC8446], DTLS
       [RFC6347], HIP [RFC7401], Kerberos [RFC4120], SASL [RFC4422], and
       EAP [RFC3748], etc.  However, these protocols also can not
       protect against illegal connection, personate connection and
       offline encountered during device access.

   3.  There are also a number of groups that focus on IoT device
       security . For example, the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA)
       recommended that when enterprises build the IoT network, they



Wang, et al.            Expires 17 September 2021               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft    Secure Access of IoT Smart Terminals        March 2021


       should strengthen IoT smart device authentication/authorization
       [CSA].  The Global System for Mobile communications Association
       (GSMA) has published a security guide for IoT systems [GSMA] to
       bring a set of security guidelines to the research of IoT
       security product.  The United States Department of Homeland
       Security(DHS) has proposed six IoT security strategic principles
       [DHS] to guide IoT developers, manufacturers, service providers,
       and consumers in considering security issues.  These teams give
       good advice on building security for the IoT, but there is no
       introduction or description of secure access to the IoT.

   4.  The current security standards on IoT, such as [RFC8576],
       introduce the security issues and solutions, but there is no
       mention of the problems and solutions in the access process of
       smart terminals.

   5.  In other related device access standards, there are device access
       and portal-based authentication based on 802.1x [ISO88021X].
       However, due to IoT smart terminals are mainly dumb terminals,
       they are not suitable for authentication access through 802.1x or
       portal, and the two authentication methods cannot be used to
       solve the illegal and personate connection of devices.

5.  Secure Access and Management of IoT Smart Terminals

5.1.  Framework of Secure Access Management

   Comparing to three-layer framework of IoT,a layer of access and
   management is added for the framework of secure access management,
   which is between transport layer and application layer.  The
   framework of secure access management for IoT smart terminals is
   shown in the following figure.  In this framework, the access process
   of IoT is divided into four parts, which are sensing&control domain,
   access&management domain, application&service domain and user domain.
   Among them, access&management domain is the specific implementation
   of the secure access and management technical requirements to ensure
   secure access of smart terminals in terms of smart terminals
   management, access control, strategy management and access log audit.

5.1.1.  Sensing & Controlling Domain

   Smart Terminals: include RS-485, RS-232 and other wired terminals,
   zigberr, Lora and other wireless terminals, smart IP, WiFi, 5g, 4G
   smart devcie, audio and video device and RFID, etc.

   IOT Gateway: Be able to store data, compute and transform protocol,
   an entity used to connect smart terminals and terminals of upper
   layer.

   Among them, smart terminals can be directly connected with the
   access&management domain, or indirectly connected with the access and
   management domain through the Internet of things gateway.

5.1.2.  Access & Management Domain

   Access and management domain is the core, which is used to manage and
   control the access of smart terminals, including four parts: device
   management, device access, access policy management and log audit.

   The contents of each part clarified as follows:

   Device Management: It mainly manages device asset information,
