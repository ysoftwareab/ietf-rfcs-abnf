              SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS)
                       draft-ietf-uta-mta-sts-08

Abstract

   SMTP Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS) is a
   mechanism enabling mail service providers to declare their ability to
   receive Transport Layer Security (TLS) secure SMTP connections, and
   to specify whether sending SMTP servers should refuse to deliver to
   MX hosts that do not offer TLS with a trusted server certificate.

1.  Introduction

   The STARTTLS extension to SMTP [RFC3207] allows SMTP clients and
   hosts to negotiate the use of a TLS channel for encrypted mail
   transmission.

   While this opportunistic encryption protocol by itself provides a
   high barrier against passive man-in-the-middle traffic interception,



Margolis, et al.        Expires February 16, 2018               [Page 2]

Internet-Draft                   MTA-STS                     August 2017


   any attacker who can delete parts of the SMTP session (such as the
   "250 STARTTLS" response) or who can redirect the entire SMTP session
   (perhaps by overwriting the resolved MX record of the delivery
   domain) can perform downgrade or interception attacks.

   This document defines a mechanism for recipient domains to publish
   policies specifying:

   o  whether MTAs sending mail to this domain can expect PKIX-
      authenticated TLS support

   o  what a conforming client should do with messages when TLS cannot
      be successfully negotiated

1.1.  Terminology

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   We also define the following terms for further use in this document:

   o  MTA-STS Policy: A commitment by the Policy Domain to support PKIX
      authenticated TLS for the specified MX hosts.

   o  Policy Domain: The domain for which an MTA-STS Policy is defined.
      This is the next-hop domain; when sending mail to
      "alice@example.com" this would ordinarly be "example.com", but
      this may be overriden by explicit routing rules (as described in
      Section 3.4, "Policy Selection for Smart Hosts and Subdomains").

2.  Related Technologies

   The DANE TLSA record [RFC7672] is similar, in that DANE is also
   designed to upgrade unauthenticated encryption or plaintext
   transmission into authenticated, downgrade-resistent encrypted
   tarnsmission.  DANE requires DNSSEC [RFC4033] for authentication; the
   mechanism described here instead relies on certificate authorities
   (CAs) and does not require DNSSEC, at a cost of risking malicious
   downgrades.  For a thorough discussion of this trade-off, see
   Section 8, "Security Considerations".

   In addition, MTA-STS provides an optional report-only mode, enabling
   soft deployments to detect policy failures; partial deployments can
   be achieved in DANE by deploying TLSA records only for some of a
   domain's MXs, but such a mechanism is not possible for the per-domain
   policies used by MTA-STS.

   The primary motivation of MTA-STS is to provide a mechanism for
   domains to upgrade their transport security even when deploying
   DNSSEC is undesirable or impractical.  However, MTA-STS is designed
   not to interfere with DANE deployments when the two overlap; in
   particular, senders who implement MTA-STS validation MUST NOT allow a
   "valid" or "report-only" MTA-STS validation to override a failing
   DANE validation.

3.  Policy Discovery

   MTA-STS policies are distributed via HTTPS from a "well-known"
   [RFC5785] path served within the Policy Domain, and their presence
   and current version are indicated by a TXT record at the Policy
   Domain.  These TXT records additionally contain a policy "id" field,
   allowing sending MTAs to check the currency of a cached policy
   without performing an HTTPS request.

   To discover if a recipient domain implements MTA-STS, a sender need
   only resolve a single TXT record.  To see if an updated policy is
   available for a domain for which the sender has a previously cached
   policy, the sender need only check the TXT record's version "id"
   against the cached value.

3.1.  MTA-STS TXT Records

   The MTA-STS TXT record is a TXT record with the name "_mta-sts" at
   the Policy Domain.  For the domain "example.com", this record would
   be "_mta-sts.example.com".  MTA-STS TXT records MUST be US-ASCII,
   semicolon-separated key/value pairs containing the following fields:

   o  "v": (plain-text, required).  Currently only "STSv1" is supported.

   o  "id": (plain-text, required).  A short string used to track policy
      updates.  This string MUST uniquely identify a given instance of a
      policy, such that senders can determine when the policy has been
      updated by comparing to the "id" of a previously seen policy.
      There is no implied ordering of "id" fields between revisions.

   An example TXT record is as below:

   "_mta-sts.example.com.  IN TXT "v=STSv1; id=20160831085700Z;""

   The formal definition of the "_mta-sts" TXT record, defined using
   [RFC7405], is as follows:

Internet-Draft                   MTA-STS                     August 2017


sts-text-record = sts-version field-delim sts-id
                  *(field-delim sts-extension) [field-delim]

field-delim     = *WSP ";" *WSP

sts-version     = %s"v=STSv1"

sts-id          = %s"id=" 1*32(ALPHA / DIGIT)        ; id=...

sts-extension   = sts-ext-name "=" sts-ext-value     ; name=value

sts-ext-name    = (ALPHA / DIGIT) *31(ALPHA / DIGIT / "_" / "-" / ".")

sts-ext-value   = 1*(%x21-3A / %x3C / %x3E-7E)       ; chars excluding
                                                     ; "=", ";", SP, and
                                                     ; control chars

   If multiple TXT records for "_mta-sts" are returned by the resolver,
   records which do not begin with "v=STSv1;" are discarded.  If the
   number of resulting records is not one, senders MUST assume the
   recipient domain does not implement MTA-STS and skip the remaining
   steps of policy discovery.

3.2.  MTA-STS Policies

   The policy itself is a set of key/value pairs served via the HTTPS
   GET method from the fixed [RFC5785] "well-known" path of ".well-
   known/mta-sts.txt" served by the "mta-sts" host at the Policy Domain;
   the [RFC2616] "Content-Type" header MUST be "text/plain".  Thus for
   "example.com" the path is "https://mta-sts.example.com/.well-known/
   mta-sts.txt".

   This resource contains the following line-separated key/value pairs:

   o  "version": (plain-text, required).  Currently only "STSv1" is
      supported.

   o  "mode": (plain-text, required).  Either "enforce" or "report",
      indicating the expected behavior of a sending MTA in the case of a
      policy validation failure.

   o  "max_age": Max lifetime of the policy (plain-text non-negative
      integer seconds, required).  Well-behaved clients SHOULD cache a
      policy for up to this value from last policy fetch time.  To
      mitigate the risks of attacks at policy refresh time, it is
      expected that this value typically be in the range of weeks or
      greater.

   o  "mx": MX identity patterns (list of plain-text strings, required).
      One or more patterns matching a Common Name ([RFC6125]) or Subject
      Alternative Name ([RFC5280]) DNS-ID present in the X.509
      certificate presented by any MX receiving mail for this domain.
      For example: "mx: mail.example.com mx: .example.net" indicates
      that mail for this domain might be handled by any MX with a
      certificate valid for a host at "mail.example.com" or
      "example.net".  Valid patterns can be either fully specified names
      ("example.com") or suffixes (".example.net") matching the right-
      hand parts of a server's identity; the latter case are
      distinguished by a leading period.  If there are more than one MX
      specified by the policy, they MUST be on separate lines within the
      policy file.  In the case of Internationalized Domain Names
      ([RFC5891]), the MX MUST specify the Punycode-encoded A-label
      [RFC3492] and not the Unicode-encoded U-label.  The full semantics
      of certificate validation are described in Section 4.1, "MX
      Certificate Validation."

   An example policy is as below:

                         version: STSv1
                         mode: enforce
                         mx: mail.example.com
                         mx: .example.net
                         mx: backupmx.example.com
                         max_age: 123456

   The formal definition of the policy resource, defined using
   [RFC7405], is as follows:

      sts-policy-max-age-field = %s"max_age"

      sts-policy-max-age-value = 1*10(DIGIT)

   Parsers MUST accept TXT records and policy files which are
   syntactically valid (i.e. valid key/value pairs separated by semi-
   colons for TXT records) and implementing a superset of this
   specification, in which case unknown fields SHALL be ignored.  If any
   field other than "mx" is duplicated, the first entry will be honored,
   the rest should be ignored.  For the "mx" field, all valid entries
   will be utilized when enforcing the stated policy.

3.3.  HTTPS Policy Fetching

   When fetching a new policy or updating a policy, the HTTPS endpoint
   MUST present a X.509 certificate which is valid for the "mta-sts"
   host (as described below), chain to a root CA that is trusted by the



Margolis, et al.        Expires February 16, 2018               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                   MTA-STS                     August 2017


   sending MTA, and be non-expired.  It is expected that sending MTAs
   use a set of trusted CAs similar to those in widely deployed Web
   browsers and operating systems.

   The certificate is valid for the "mta-sts" host with respect to the
   rules described in [RFC6125], with the following application-specific
   considerations:

   o  Matching is performed only against the DNS-ID and CN-ID
      identifiers.

   o  DNS domain names in server certificates MAY contain the wildcard
      character '*' as the complete left-most label within the
      identifier.

   The certificate MAY be checked for revocation via the Online
   Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) [RFC2560], certificate revocation
   lists (CRLs), or some other mechanism.

   HTTP 3xx redirects MUST NOT be followed.

   Senders may wish to rate-limit the frequency of attempts to fetch the
   HTTPS endpoint even if a valid TXT record for the recipient domain
   exists.  In the case that the HTTPS GET fails, we suggest
   implementions may limit further attempts to a period of five minutes
   or longer per version ID, to avoid overwhelming resource-constrained
   recipients with cascading failures.

   Senders MAY impose a timeout on the HTTPS GET and/or a limit on the
   maximum size of the response body to avoid long delays or resource
   exhaustion during attempted policy updates.  A suggested timeout is
   one minute, and a suggested maximum policy size 64 kilobytes; policy
   hosts SHOULD respond to requests with a complete policy body within
   that timeout and size limit.

   If a valid TXT record is found but no policy can be fetched via HTTPS
   (for any reason), and there is no valid (non-expired) previously-
   cached policy, senders MUST continue with delivery as though the
   domain has not implemented MTA-STS.  Senders who implement TLSRPT
   (TODO: add ref) should, however, report this failure to the recipient
   domain if the domain implements TLSRPT as well.

   Conversely, if no "live" policy can be discovered via DNS or fetched
   via HTTPS, but a valid (non-expired) policy exists in the sender's
   cache, the sender MUST apply that cached policy.

3.4.  Policy Selection for Smart Hosts and Subdomains

   When sending mail via a "smart host"--an intermediate SMTP relay
   rather than the message recipient's server--compliant senders MUST
   treat the smart host domain as the policy domain for the purposes of
   policy discovery and application.

   When sending mail to a mailbox at a subdomain, compliant senders MUST
   NOT attempt to fetch a policy from the parent zone.  Thus for mail
   sent to "user@mail.example.com", the policy can be fetched only from
   "mail.example.com", not "example.com".

4.  Policy Validation

   When sending to an MX at a domain for which the sender has a valid
   and non-expired MTA-STS policy, a sending MTA honoring MTA-STS MUST
   validate:

   1.  That the recipient MX supports STARTTLS and offers a valid PKIX-
       based TLS certificate.

   2.  That at least one of the policy's "mx" patterns matches at least
       one of the identities presented in the MX's X.509 certificate, as
       described in "MX Certificate Validation".

   This section does not dictate the behavior of sending MTAs when
   policies fail to validate; in particular, validation failures of
   policies which specify "report" mode MUST NOT be interpreted as
   delivery failures, as described in Section 5, "Policy Application".

4.1.  MX Certificate Validation

   The certificate presented by the receiving MX MUST chain to a root CA
   that is trusted by the sending MTA and be non-expired.  The
   certificate MUST have a CN-ID ([RFC6125]) or SAN ([RFC5280]) with a
   DNS-ID matching the "mx" pattern.  The MX's certificate MAY also be
   checked for revocation via OCSP [RFC2560], certificate revocation
   lists (CRLs), or some other mechanism.

   Because the "mx" patterns are not hostnames, however, matching is not
   identical to other common cases of X.509 certificate authentication
   (as described, for example, in [RFC6125]).  Consider the example
   policy given above, with an "mx" pattern containing ".example.net".
   In this case, if the MX server's X.509 certificate contains a SAN
   matching "*.example.net", we are required to implement "wildcard-to-
   wildcard" matching.

Internet-Draft                   MTA-STS                     August 2017


   To simplify this case, we impose the following constraints on
   wildcard certificates, identical to those in [RFC7672] section 3.2.3
   and [@!RFC6125 section 6.4.3: wildcards are valid in DNS-IDs or CN-
   IDs, but must be the entire first label of the identifier (that is,
   "*.example.com", not "mail*.example.com").  Senders who are comparing
   a "suffix" MX pattern with a wildcard identifier should thus strip
   the wildcard and ensure that the two sides match label-by-label,
   until all labels of the shorter side (if unequal length) are
   consumed.

   A simple pseudocode implementation of this algorithm is presented in
   the Appendix.

5.  Policy Application

   When sending to an MX at a domain for which the sender has a valid,
   non-expired MTA-STS policy, a sending MTA honoring MTA-STS applies
   the result of a policy validation failure one of two ways, depending
   on the value of the policy "mode" field:

   1.  "report": In this mode, sending MTAs which also implement the
       TLSRPT specification (TODO: add ref) merely send a report
       indicating policy application failures (so long as TLSRPT is also
       implemented by the recipient domain).

   2.  "enforce": In this mode, sending MTAs MUST NOT deliver the
       message to hosts which fail MX matching or certificate
       validation.

   When a message fails to deliver due to an "enforce" policy, a
   compliant MTA MUST NOT permanently fail to deliver messages before
   checking for the presence of an updated policy at the Policy Domain.
   (In all cases, MTAs SHOULD treat such failures as transient errors
   and retry delivery later.)  This allows implementing domains to
   update long-lived policies on the fly.

   Finally, in both "enforce" and "report" modes, failures to deliver in
   compliance with the applied policy result in failure reports to the
   policy domain, as described in the TLSRPT specification (TODO: add
   ref).

5.1.  Policy Application Control Flow

   An example control flow for a compliant sender consists of the
   following steps:

   1.  Check for a cached policy whose time-since-fetch has not exceeded
       its "max_age".  If none exists, attempt to fetch a new policy



Margolis, et al.        Expires February 16, 2018              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft                   MTA-STS                     August 2017


       (perhaps asynchronously, so as not to block message delivery).
       Optionally, sending MTAs may unconditionally check for a new
       policy at this step.

   2.  For each candidate MX, in order of MX priority, attempt to
       deliver the message, enforcing STARTTLS and, assuming a policy is
       present, PKIX certificate validation as described in Section 4.1,
       "MX Certificate Validation."

   3.  A message delivery MUST NOT be permanently failed until the
       sender has first checked for the presence of a new policy (as
       indicated by the "id" field in the "_mta-sts" TXT record).  If a
       new policy is not found, existing rules for the case of temporary
       message delivery failures apply (as discussed in [RFC5321]
       section 4.5.4.1).

6.  Operational Considerations

6.1.  Policy Updates

   Updating the policy requires that the owner make changes in two
   places: the "_mta-sts" TXT record in the Policy Domain's DNS zone and
   at the corresponding HTTPS endpoint.  As a result, recipients should
   expect a policy will continue to be used by senders until both the
   HTTPS and TXT endpoints are updated and the TXT record's TTL has
   passed.

   In other words, a sender who is unable to successfully deliver a
   message while applying a cache of the recipient's now-outdated policy
   may be unable to discover that a new policy exists until the DNS TTL
   has passed.  Recipients should therefore ensure that old policies
   continue to work for message delivery during this period of time, or
   risk message delays.

   Recipients should also prefer to update the HTTPS policy body before
   updating the TXT record; this ordering avoids the risk that senders,
   seeing a new TXT record, mistakenly cache the old policy from HTTPS.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Well-Known URIs Registry

   A new .well-known URI will be registered in the Well-Known URIs
   registry as described below:

8.  Security Considerations

   SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security attempts to protect against an
   active attacker who wishes to intercept or tamper with mail between
   hosts who support STARTTLS.  There are two classes of attacks
   considered:

   o  Foiling TLS negotiation, for example by deleting the "250
      STARTTLS" response from a server or altering TLS session
      negotiation.  This would result in the SMTP session occurring over
      plaintext, despite both parties supporting TLS.

   o  Impersonating the destination mail server, whereby the sender
      might deliver the message to an impostor, who could then monitor
      and/or modify messages despite opportunistic TLS.  This
      impersonation could be accomplished by spoofing the DNS MX record



Margolis, et al.        Expires February 16, 2018              [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                   MTA-STS                     August 2017


      for the recipient domain, or by redirecting client connections
      intended for the legitimate recipient server (for example, by
      altering BGP routing tables).

   MTA-STS can thwart such attacks only if the sender is able to
   previously obtain and cache a policy for the recipient domain, and
   only if the attacker is unable to obtain a valid certificate that
   complies with that policy.  Below, we consider specific attacks on
   this model.

8.1.  Obtaining a Signed Certificate

   SMTP MTA-STS relies on certificate validation via PKIX based TLS
   identity checking [RFC6125].  Attackers who are able to obtain a
   valid certificate for the targeted recipient mail service (e.g. by
   compromising a certificate authority) are thus able to circumvent STS
   authentication.

8.2.  Preventing Policy Discovery

   Since MTA-STS uses DNS TXT records for policy discovery, an attacker
   who is able to block DNS responses can suppress the discovery of an
   MTA-STS Policy, making the Policy Domain appear not to have an MTA-
   STS Policy.  The sender policy cache is designed to resist this
   attack by decreasing the frequency of policy discovery and thus
   reducing the window of vulnerability; it is nonetheless a risk that
   attackers who can predict or induce policy discovery--for example, by
   inducing a victim sending domain to send mail to a never-before-
   contacted recipient while carrying out a man-in-the-middle attack--
   may be able to foil policy discovery and effectively downgrade the
   security of the message delivery.

   Since this attack depends upon intercepting initial policy discovery,
   we strongly recommend implementors to prefer policy "max_age" values
   to be as long as is practical.

   Because this attack is also possible upon refresh of a cached policy,
   we suggest implementors do not wait until a cached policy has expired
   before checking for an update; if senders attempt to refresh the
   cache regularly (for instance, by checking their cached version
   string against the TXT record on each successful send, or in a
   background task that runs daily or weekly), an attacker would have to
   foil policy discovery consistently over the lifetime of a cached
   policy to prevent a successful refresh.

   Resistence to downgrade attacks of this nature--due to the ability to
   authoritatively determine "lack of a record" even for non-




Margolis, et al.        Expires February 16, 2018              [Page 13]

   participating recipients--is a feature of DANE, due to its use of
   DNSSEC for policy discovery.

8.3.  Denial of Service

   We additionally consider the Denial of Service risk posed by an
   attacker who can modify the DNS records for a victim domain.  Absent
   MTA-STS, such an attacker can cause a sending MTA to cache invalid MX
   records, but only for however long the sending resolver caches those
   records.  With MTA-STS, the attacker can additionally advertise a
   new, long-"max_age" MTA-STS policy with "mx" constraints that
   validate the malicious MX record, causing senders to cache the policy
   and refuse to deliver messages once the victim has resecured the MX
   records.

   This attack is mitigated in part by the ability of a victim domain to
   (at any time) publish a new policy updating the cached, malicious
   policy, though this does require the victim domain to both obtain a
   valid CA-signed certificate and to understand and properly configure
   MTA-STS.

   Similarly, we consider the possibility of domains that deliberately
   allow untrusted users to serve untrusted content on user-specified
   subdomains.  In some cases (e.g. the service Tumblr.com) this takes
   the form of providing HTTPS hosting of user-registered subdomains; in
   other cases (e.g. dynamic DNS providers) this takes the form of
   allowing untrusted users to register custom DNS records at the
   provider's domain.

   In these cases, there is a risk that untrusted users would be able to
   serve custom content at the "mta-sts" host, including serving an
   illegitimate MTA-STS policy.  We believe this attack is rendered more
   difficult by the need for the attacker to also serve the "_mta-sts"
   TXT record on the same domain--something not, to our knowledge,
   widely provided to untrusted users.  This attack is additionally
   mitigated by the aforementioned ability for a victim domain to update
   an invalid policy at any future date.

8.4.  Weak Policy Constraints

   Even if an attacker cannot modify a served policy, the potential
   exists for configurations that allow attackers on the same domain to
   receive mail for that domain.  For example, an easy configuration
   option when authoring an MTA-STS Policy for "example.com" is to set
   the "mx" equal to ".example.com"; recipient domains must consider in
   this case the risk that any user possessing a valid hostname and CA-
   signed certificate (for example, "dhcp-123.example.com") will, from

   the perspective of MTA-STS Policy validation, be a valid MX host for
   that domain.

   The owner of "example.com" wishes to begin using MTA-STS with a
   policy that will solicit reports from senders without affecting how
   the messages are processed, in order to verify the identity of MXs
   that handle mail for "example.com", confirm that TLS is correctly
   used, and ensure that certificates presented by the recipient MX
   validate.
