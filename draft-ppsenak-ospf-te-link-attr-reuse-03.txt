          OSPFv2 Link Traffic Engineering (TE) Attribute Reuse
              draft-ppsenak-ospf-te-link-attr-reuse-03.txt

Abstract

   Various link attributes have been defined in OSPFv2 in the context of
   the MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) and GMPLS.  Many of these link
   attributes can be used for purposes other than MPLS Traffic
   Engineering or GMPLS.  This documents defines how to distribute such
   attributes in OSPFv2 for applications other than MPLS Traffic
   Engineering or GMPLS purposes.

Internet-Draft       OSPFv2 Link TE Attributes Reuse         August 2016


1.  Introduction

   Various link attributes have been defined in OSPFv2 [RFC2328] in the
   context of the MPLS traffic engineering and GMPLS.  All these
   attributes are distributed by OSPFv2 as sub-TLVs of the Link-TLV
   advertised in the OSPFv2 TE Opaque LSA [RFC3630].

   Many of these link attributes are useful outside of the traditional
   MPLS Traffic Engineering or GMPLS.  This brings its own set of
   problems, in particular how to distribute these link attributes in
   OSPFv2 when MPLS TE or GMPLS are not deployed or are deployed in
   parallel with other applications that use these link attributes.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Link attributes examples

   This section lists some of the link attributes originally defined for
   MPLS Traffic Engineering that can be used for other purposes in
   OSPFv2.  The list doesn't necessarily contain all the required
   attributes.

   1.  Remote Interface IP address [RFC3630] - OSPFv2 currently cannot
       distinguish between parallel links between two OSPFv2 routers.
       As a result, the two-way connectivity check performed during SPF
       may succeed when the two routers disagree on which of the links
       to use for data traffic.

   2.  Link Local/Remote Identifiers - [RFC4203] - Used for the two-way
       connectivity check for parallel unnumbered links.  Also used for
       identifying adjacencies for unnumbered links in Segment Routing
       traffic engineering.

   3.  Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) [RFC4203]  - In IPFRR, the SRLG is
       used to compute diverse backup paths [RFC5714].

   4.  Unidirectional Link Delay/Loss Metrics [RFC7471] - Could be used
       for the shortest path first (SPF) computation using alternate
       metrics within an OSPF area.

3.  Advertising Link Attributes

   This section outlines possible approaches for advertising link
   attributes originally defined for MPLS Traffic Engineering purposes
   or GMPLS when they are used for other applications.

3.1.  TE Opaque LSA

   One approach for advertising link attributes is to continue to use TE
   Opaque LSA ([RFC3630]).  There are several problems with this
   approach:

   1.  Whenever the link is advertised in a TE Opaque LSA, the link
       becomes a part of the TE topology, which may not match IP routed
       topology.  By making the link part of the TE topology, remote
       nodes may mistakenly believe that the link is available for MPLS
       TE or GMPLS, when, in fact, MPLS is not enabled on the link.

   2.  The TE Opaque LSA carries link attributes that are not used or
       required by MPLS TE or GMPLS.  There is no mechanism in a TE
       Opaque LSA to indicate which of the link attributes are passed to
       MPLS TE application and which are used by other applications
       including OSPFv2 itself.

   3.  Link attributes used for non-TE purposes are partitioned across
       multiple LSAs - the TE Opaque LSA and the Extended Link Opaque
       LSA.  This partitioning will require implementations to lookup
       multiple LSAs to extract link attributes for a single link,
       bringing needless complexity to OSPFv2 implementations.

   The advantage of this approach is that there is no additional
   standardization requirement to advertise the TE/GMPL attributes for
   other applications.  Additionally, link attributes are only
   advertised once when both OSPF TE and other applications are deployed
   on the same link.  This is not expected to be a common deployment
   scenario.

3.2.  Extended Link Opaque LSA

   An alternative approach for advertising link attributes is to use
   Extended Link Opaque LSAs as defined in [RFC7684].  This LSA was
   defined as a generic container for distribution of the extended link
   attributes.  There are several advantages in using Extended Link LSA:

   1.  Advertisement of the link attributes does not make the link part
       of the TE topology.  It avoids any conflicts and is fully
       compatible with the [RFC3630].

Internet-Draft       OSPFv2 Link TE Attributes Reuse         August 2016


   2.  The TE Opaque LSA remains truly opaque to OSPFv2 as originally
       defined in [RFC3630].  Its content is not inspected by OSPFv2 and
       OSPFv2 acts as a pure transport.

   3.  There is clear distinction between link attributes used by TE and
       link attributes used by other OSPFv2 applications.

   4.  All link attributes that are used by OSPFv2 applications are
       advertised in a single LSA, the Extended Link Opaque LSA.

   The disadvantage of this approach is that in rare cases, the same
   link attribute is advertised in both the TE Opaque and Extended Link
   Attribute LSAs.  Additionally, there will be additional
   standardization effort.  However, this could also be viewed as an
   advantage as the non-TE use cases for the TE link attributes are
   documented and validated by the OSPF working group.

3.3.  Selected Approach

   It is RECOMMENDED to use the Extended Link Opaque LSA ([RFC7684] to
   advertise any link attributes used for non-TE purposes in OSPFv2,
   including those that have been originally defined for TE purposes.
   TE link attributes used for TE purposes continue to use TE Opaque LSA
   ([RFC3630]).

   It is also RECOMMENDED to keep the format of the link attribute TLVs
   that have been defined for TE purposes unchanged even when they are
   used for non-TE purposes.

   Finally, it is RECOMMENDED to allocate unique code points for link
   attribute TLVs that have been defined for TE purposes for the OSPFv2
   Extended Link TLV Sub-TLV Registry as defined in [RFC7684].  For each
   reused TLV, the code point will be defined in an IETF document along
   with the expected usecase(s).

4.  Reused TE link attributes

   This section defines the use case and code points for the OSPFv2
   Extended Link TLV Sub-TLV Registry for some of the link attributes
   that have been originally defined for TE or GMPLS purposes.

4.1.  Remote interface IP address

   The OSPFv2 description of an IP numbered point-to-point adjacency
   does not include the remote IP address.  As described in Section 2,
   this makes the two-way connectivity check ambiguous in the presence
   of the parallel point-to-point links between two OSPFv2 routers.

Internet-Draft       OSPFv2 Link TE Attributes Reuse         August 2016


   The Remote IP address of the link can also be used for Segment
   Routing traffic engineering to identify the link in a set of parallel
   links between two OSPFv2 routers
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-segment-routing-extensions].  Similarly, the remote IP
   address is useful in identifying individual parallel OSPF links
   advertised in BGP Link-State as described in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution].

   To advertise the Remote interface IP address in the OSPFv2 Extended
   Link TLV, the same format of the sub-TLV as defined in section 2.5.4.
   of [RFC3630] is used and TLV type TBD1 is used.

4.2.  Link Local/Remote Identifiers

   The OSPFv2 description of an IP unnumbered point-to-point adjacency
   does not include the remote link identifier.  As described in
   Section 2, this makes the two-way connectivity check ambiguous in the
   presence of the parallel point-to-point IP unnumbered links between
   two OSPFv2 routers.

   The local and remote link identifiers can also be used for Segment
   Routing traffic engineering to identify the link in a set of parallel
   IP unnumbered links between two OSPFv2 routers
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-segment-routing-extensions].  Similarly, these
   identifiers are useful in identifying individual parallel OSPF links
   advertised in BGP Link-State as described in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution].

   To advertise the link Local/Remote identifiers in the OSPFv2 Extended
   Link TLV, the same format of the sub-TLV as defined in section 1.1.
   of [RFC4203] is used and TLV type TBD2 is used.

4.3.  Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG)

   The SRLG of a link can be used in IPFRR to compute a backup path that
   does not share any SRLG group with the protected link.

   To advertise the SRLG of the link in the OSPFv2 Extended Link TLV,
   the same format of the sub-TLV as defined in section 1.3. of
   [RFC4203] is used and TLV type TBD3 is used.

4.4.  Extended Metrics

   [RFC3630] defines several link bandwidth types.  [RFC7471] defines
   extended link metrics that are based on link bandwidth, delay and
   loss characteristics.  All these can be used to compute best paths
   within an OSPF area to satisfy requirements for bandwidth, delay
   (nominal or worst case) or loss.

Internet-Draft       OSPFv2 Link TE Attributes Reuse         August 2016


   To advertise extended link metrics in the OSPFv2 Extended Link TLV,
   the same format of the sub-TLVs as defined in [RFC7471] is used with
   following TLV types:

      TBD4 - Unidirectional Link Delay

      TBD5 - Min/Max Unidirectional Link Delay

      TBD6 - Unidirectional Delay Variation

      TBD7 - Unidirectional Link Loss

      TBD8 - Unidirectional Residual Bandwidth

      TBD9 - Unidirectional Available Bandwidth

      TBD10 - Unidirectional Utilized Bandwidth

5.  Advertisement of Application Specific Values

   Multiple applications can utilize link attributes that are flooded by
   OSPFv2.  Some examples of applications using the link attributes are
   Segment Routing Traffic Engineering and LFA [RFC5286].

   In some cases the link attribute only has a single value that is
   applicable to all applications.  An example is a Remote interface IP
   address [Section 4.1] or Link Local/Remote Identifiers [Section 4.2].

   In some cases the link attribute MAY have different values for
   different applications.  An example could be SRLG [Section 4.3],
   where values used by LFA could be different then the values used by
   Segment Routing Traffic Engineering.

   To allow advertisement of the application specific values of the link
   attribute, a new Extended Link Attribute sub-TLV of the Extended Link
   TLV [RFC7471] is defined.  The Extended Link Attribute sub-TLV is an
   optional sub-TLV and can appear multiple times in the Extended Link
   TLV.  It has following format:

   where:

      Type: TBD11, suggested value 14

      Length: variable

      Application Bit-Mask Length: length of the Application Bit-Mask.
      If the Application Bit-Mask is not present, the Application Bit-
      Mask Length MUST be set to 0.

      Application Bit-Mask: Optional set of bits, where each bit
      represents a single application.  The following bits are defined
      by this document:

         Bit-0: Segment Routing Traffic Engineering

         Bit-1: LFA

   Undefined bits in Application Bit-Mask MUST be transmitted as 0 and
   MUST be ignored on receipt.  Bits that are NOT transmitted MUST be
   treated as if they are set to 0 on receipt.

   If the link attribute advertisement is limited to be used by a
   specific set of applications, Application Bit-Mask MUST be present
   and application specific bit(s) MUST be set for all applications that
   use the link attributes advertised in the Extended Link Attribute
   sub-TLV.

   Application Bit-Mask applies to all link attributes that support
   application specific values and are advertised in the Extended Link
   Attribute sub-TLV.

Internet-Draft       OSPFv2 Link TE Attributes Reuse         August 2016


   The advantage of not making the Application Bit-Mask part of the
   attribute advertisement itself is that we can keep the format of the
   link attributes that have been defined previously and reuse the same
   format when advertising them in the Extended Link Attribute sub-TLV.

   If the link attribute is advertised and there is no Application Bit-
   Mask present in the Extended Link Attribute Sub-TLV, the link
   attribute advertisement MAY be used by any application.  If, however,
   another advertisement of the same link attribute includes Application
   Bit-Mask in the Extended Link Attribute sub-TLV, applications that
   are listed in the Application Bit-Mask of such Extended Link
   Attribute sub-TLV SHOULD use the attribute advertisement which has
   the application specific bit set in the Application Bit-Mask.

   If the same application is listed in the Application Bit-Mask of more
   then one Extended Link Attribute sub-TLV, the application SHOULD use
   the first advertisement and ignore any subsequent advertisements of
   the same attribute.  This situation SHOULD be logged as an error.

   This document defines the set of link attributes for which the
   Application Bit-Mask may be advertised.  If the Application Bit-Mask
   is included in the Extended Link Attribute sub-TLV that advertises
   any link attribute(s) NOT listed below, the Application Bit-Mask MUST
   NOT be used for such link attribute(s).  It MUST be used for those
   attribute(s) that support application specific values.  Documents
   which define new link attributes MUST state whether the new
   attributes support application specific values.  The link attributes
   to which the Application Bit-Mask may apply are:

      - Shared Risk Link Group

      - Unidirectional Link Delay

      - Min/Max Unidirectional Link Delay

      - Unidirectional Delay Variation

      - Unidirectional Link Loss

      - Unidirectional Residual Bandwidth

      - Unidirectional Available Bandwidth

      - Unidirectional Utilized Bandwidth

6.  Backward Compatibility

   Link attributes may be concurrently advertised in both the TE Opaque
   LSA [RFC3630] and the Extended Link Opaque LSA [RFC7684].

   In fact, there is at least one OSPF implementation that utilizes the
   link attributes advertised in TE Opaque LSAs [RFC3630] for Non-RSVP
   TE applications.  For example, this implementation of LFA and remote
   LFA utilizes links attributes such as Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLG)
   [RFC4203] and Admin Group [[RFC3630]advertised in TE Opaque LSAs.
   These applications are described in [RFC5286], [RFC7490],
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-lfa-manageability] and
   [I-D.psarkar-rtgwg-rlfa-node-protection].

   When an OSPF routing domain includes routers using link attributes
   from TE Opaque LSAs for Non-RSVP TE applications such as LFA, OSPF
   routers in that domain should continue to advertise such TE Opaque
   LSAs.  If there are also OSPF routers using the link attributes
   described herein for Non-RSVP applications, OSPF routers in the
   routing domain will also need to advertise these attributes in OSPF
   Extended Link Attributes LSAs [RFC7684].  In such a deployment, the
   advertised attributes SHOULD be the same and Non-RSVP application
   access to link attributes is a matter of local policy.

7.  Security Considerations

   Implementations must assure that malformed TLV and Sub-TLV
   permutations do not result in errors that cause hard OSPFv2 failures.

8.  IANA Considerations

   OSPFv2 Extended Link TLV Sub-TLVs registry [RFC7684] defines sub-TLVs
   at any level of nesting for OSPFv2 Extended Link TLVs.  This
   specification updates OSPFv2 Extended Link TLV sub-TLVs registry with
   the following TLV types:

      TBD1 (4 Recommended) - Remote interface IP address

      TBD2 (5 Recommended) - Link Local/Remote Identifiers

      TBD3 (6 Recommended) - Shared Risk Link Group

      TBD4 (7 Recommended) - Unidirectional Link Delay

      TBD5 (8 Recommended) - Min/Max Unidirectional Link Delay

      TBD6 (9 Recommended) - Unidirectional Delay Variation
