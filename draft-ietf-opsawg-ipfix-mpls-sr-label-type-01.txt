1.  Introduction

   Besides BGP-4 [RFC8277], LDP [RFC5036] and BGP VPN [RFC4364], four
   new routing-protocols, OSPFv2 Extensions [RFC8665], OSPFv3 Extensions
   [RFC8666], IS-IS Extensions [RFC8667] and BGP Prefix-SID [RFC8669]
   have been added to the list of routing-protocols able to propagate
   Segment Routing labels for the MPLS data plane [RFC8660].

   Traffic Accounting in Segment Routing Networks
   [I-D.ali-spring-sr-traffic-accounting] describes how IPFIX can be
   leveraged to account traffic to MPLS Segment Routing label dimensions
   within a Segment Routing domain.

   In the Information Model for IP Flow Information Export IPFIX
   [RFC7012], the information element mplsTopLabelType(46) describes
   which MPLS control plane protocol allocated the top-of-stack label in
   the MPLS label stack.  RFC 7012 section 7.2 [RFC7012] describes the
   "IPFIX MPLS label type (Value 46)" sub-registry [IANA-IPFIX-IE46]
   where new code points should be added.

2.  MPLS Segment Routing Top Label Type

   By introducing four new code points to information element
   mplsTopLabelType(46) for IS-IS, OSPFv2, OSPFv3 and BGP Prefix-SID,
   when Segment Routing with one of these four routing protocols is
   deployed, we get insight into which traffic is being forwarded based
   on which MPLS control plane protocol.

   A typical use case scenario is to monitor MPLS control plane
   migrations from LDP to IS-IS or OSPF Segment Routing.  Such a
   migration can be done node by node as described in RFC8661 [RFC8661].

   Another use case scenario is to monitor MPLS control plane migrations
   from dynamic BGP labels according to RFC8277 [RFC8277] to BGP Prefix-

   SID according to RFC8669 [RFC8669] in context of Seamless MPLS SR
   [I-D.hegde-spring-mpls-seamless-sr].

   Both use cases can be verified by using mplsTopLabelType(46),
   mplsTopLabelIPv4Address(47), mplsTopLabelIPv6Address(140),
   mplsTopLabelStackSection(70) and forwardingStatus(89) dimensions to
   get insights into

   o  how many packets are forwarded or dropped

   o  if dropped, for which reasons

   o  the MPLS provider edge loopback address and label protocol

   By looking at the MPLS label value itself, it is not always clear as
   to which label protocol it belongs, since they could potentially
   share the same label allocation range.  This is the case for IGP-
   Adjacency SID's, LDP and dynamic BGP labels as an example.

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate four code points in the existing sub-
   registry "IPFIX MPLS label type (Value 46)" of the "IPFIX Information
   Elements" registry for IS-IS, OSPFv2, OSPFv3 and BGP Prefix-SID
   Segment Routing extensions.

 Figure 1: Updates to "IPFIX MPLS label type (Value 46)" SubRegistry

   Note to IANA:

   o  Please assign TBD1 to 4 to the next available numbers according to
      the "IPFIX MPLS label type (Value 46)" sub-registry
      [IANA-IPFIX-IE46] procedure.

   o  Please replace the [RFC-to-be] with the RFC number assigned to
      this document.

   Note to RFC-editor:

   o  Please remove above two IANA notes.

4.  Operational Considerations

   In the information element mplsTopLabelType(46), the BGP code point 4
   refers to the label value in MP_REACH_NLRI path attribute described
   in section 2 of RFC8277 [RFC8277], and the BGP Segment Routing
   Prefix-SID code point TBD4 to the label index value in the Label-
   Index TLV described in section 3.1 of RFC8669 [RFC8669].

5.  Security Considerations

   There exists no extra security considerations regarding the
   allocation of these new IPFIX information elements compared to
   RFC7012 [RFC7012].

   Feren, as well Benoit Claise, Loa Andersson, Tianran Zhou, Pierre
