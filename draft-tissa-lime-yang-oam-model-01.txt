Abstract

   This document presents YANG Data model for OAM. It provides a
   protocol-independent and technology-independent abstraction of key
   OAM constructs. These abstractions span OAM configuration and
   operational data; they promote uniformity between OAM technologies
   and support nested OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at
   different layers through a unified interface).

Internet-Draft     YANG Data Model for Generic OAM         October 2014


1. Introduction

   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) are important
   networking functions that allow operators to:

   1. Monitor networks (Connectivity Verification, Continuity Check)

   2. Troubleshoot failures (Fault verification and isolation).

   3. Measure Performance

   An overview of OAM tools is presented at [OAMOVW].

   Ping and Traceroute [RFC792], [RFC4443] are well-known fault
   verification and isolation tools, respectively, for IP networks. Over
   the years different technologies have developed similar tools for
   similar purposes.

   [8021Q] Connectivity Fault Management is a well-established OAM
   standard that is widely adopted for Ethernet networks. ITU-T [Y1731],
   MEF Service OAM, MPLS-TP [RFC6371], TRILL [TRILLOAMFM] all define OAM
   methods based on manageability frame work of [8021Q] CFM.

   Given the wide adoption of the underlying OAM concepts defined in
   [8021Q] CFM, it is a reasonable choice to develop the unified
   management framework based on those concepts. In this document, we
   take the [8021Q] CFM model and extend it to a technology independent
   framework and build the corresponding YANG model accordingly. The
   YANG model presented in this document is the base model and supports
   IP Ping and Traceroute. The generic OAM YANG model is designed such
   that it can be extended to cover various technologies. Technology
   dependent nodes and RPC commands are defined in technology specific
   YANG models, which use and extend the base model defined here. As an
   example, VXLAN uses source UDP port number for flow entropy, while
   MPLS [RFC4379] uses IP addresses or the label stack for flow entropy
   in the hashing for multipath selection. To capture this variation,
   corresponding YANG models would define the applicable structures as
   augmentation to the generic base model presented here. This
   accomplishes three purposes: first it keeps each YANG model smaller
   and manageable. Second, it allows independent development of
   corresponding YANG models. Third, implementations can limit support
   to only the applicable set of YANG models. (e.g. TRILL RBridge may
   only need to implement Generic OAM model and the TRILL YANG model).

   All implementations that follow the YANG framework presented in this
   document MUST implement the generic OAM YANG model presented here.

Internet-Draft     YANG Data Model for Generic OAM         October 2014


   The YANG data mode presented in this document occurs at the
   management layer. Encapsulations and state machines may differ
   according to each OAM protocol. A user who wishes to issues a Ping
   command or a Traceroute or initiate a performance monitoring session
   can do so in the same manner regardless of the underlying protocol or
   technology or specific vendor implementation.

   As an example, consider a scenario where an IP ping from device A to
   Device B failed. Between device A and B there are IEEE 802.1 bridges
   a,b and c. Let's assume a,b and c are using [8021Q] CFM. A user upon
   detecting the IP layer ping failure, may decide to drill down to the
   Ethernet layer and issue the corresponding fault verification (LBM)
   and fault isolation (LTM) tools, using the same API. This ability to
   go up and down to different layers for troubleshooting is referred to
   as "nested OAM workflow" and is a useful concept that leads to
   efficient network troubleshooting and maintenance. The OAM YANG model
   presented in this document facilitates that without needing changes
   to the underlying protocols.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.

3. Architecture of OAM YANG Model

   In this document we define the YANG model for Generic OAM. The YANG
   model defined here is generic such that other technologies can extend
   it for technology specific needs. The Generic OAM YANG model acts as
   the root for other OAM YANG models. This allows users to traverse
   between OAM of different technologies at ease through a uniform API
   set. This is also provides a nested OAM workflow. Figure 1 depicts
   the relationship of different OAM YANG models to the Generic OAM YANG
   Model. Some technologies may have different sub-technologies. As an
   example, consider Network Virtualization Overlays. These could employ
   either vXLAN or NVGRE as encapsulation. The Generic OAM YANG model
   provides a framework where technology-specific YANG models can
   inherit constructs from parent YANG models without needing to
   redefine them within the sub-technology.

   Figure 1 depicts relationship of different YANG modules.

4. Overview of the OAM Model

   In this document we adopt the concepts of the [8021Q] CFM model and
   structure it such that it can be adapted to different technologies.

   At the top of the Model is the Maintenance Domain. Each Maintenance
   Domain is associated with a Maintenance Name and a Domain Level.

   Under each Maintenance Domain there is one or more Maintenance
   Association (MA). In IP, the MA can be per IP Subnet, in NVO3 this
   can be per VNI and for TRILL this can be per Fine-Grained Label or
   for VPLS this can be per VPLS instance.

   Under each MA, there can be two or more MEPs (Maintenance End
   Points).  MEPs are addressed by their respective technology specific
   address identifiers. The YANG model presented here provides
   flexibility to accommodate different addressing schemes.

   In a parallel vertical, presented are the commands. Those, in YANG
   terms, are the rpc commands. These rpc commands provide uniform APIs
   for ping, traceroute and their equivalents as well as other OAM
   commands.

   [8021Q] CFM framework requires explicit configuration of OAM entities
   prior to using any of the OAM tools. Users of Ping and Traceroute
   tools within IP devices are expecting ability to use OAM tools with
   no explicit configuration. In order to facilitate zero-touch
   experience, this document defines a default mode of OAM. The default
   mode of OAM is referred to as the Base Mode and specifies default
   values for each of the [8021Q] CFM parameters, such as Maintenance
   Domain Level, Name of the Maintenance Association and Addresses of
   MEP and so on. The default values of these depend on the technology.
   Base Mode for TRILL is defined in [TRILLOAMFM]. Section X of this
   document specifies the Base mode for IP devices. Base mode for other
   technologies such as NVO3, MPLS and future extensions will be defined
   in their corresponding documents.

   It is important to note that, no specific enhancements are needed in
   the YANG model to support Base Mode. Implementations that comply with
   this document, by default implement the data nodes of the applicable
   technology. Data nodes of the Base Mode are read-only nodes.

4.1. Maintenance Domain (MD) configuration

   The container "domains" is the top level container within the ietf-
   oam module. Within the container "domains", separate list is
   maintained per MD. The MD list uses the key MD-name for indexing.

4.4. rpc definitions

   The rpc model facilitates issuing commands to a NETCONF server (in
   this case to the device that need to execute the OAM command) and
   obtain a response. rpc model defined here abstracts OAM specific
   commands in a technology independent manner.

   There are several rpc commands defined for the purpose of OAM. In
   this section we present a snippet of the ping command for
   illustration purposes. Please refer to Section 4 for the complete
   data hierarchy and Section 5 for the YANG model.

7. Base Mode for IP

   The Base Mode defines default configuration that MUST be present in
   the devices that comply with this document. Base Mode allows users to
   have "zero-touch" experience. Several parameters require technology
   specific definition.

7.1. MEP Address

   In the Base Mode of operation, the MEP Address is the IP address of
   the interface on which the MEP is located.

Internet-Draft     YANG Data Model for Generic OAM         October 2014


7.2. MEP ID for Base Mode

   In the Base Mode of operation, each device creates a single UP MEP
   associated with a virtual OAM port with no physical layer (NULL PHY).
   The MEPID associated with this MEP is zero (0). The choice of MEP-ID
   zero is explained below.

   MEPID is 2 octet field. It is never used on the wire except when
   using CCM. Ping, traceroute and session monitoring does not use the
   MEPID on its message header. It is important to have method that can
   derive MEP ID of base mode in an automatic manner with no user
   intervention. IP address cannot be directly used for this purpose as
   the MEP ID is much smaller field. For Base Mode of IP we propose to
   use MEP ID zero (0) as the default MEP-ID.

   CCM packet use MEP-ID on the paylod. CCM MUST NOT be used in the Base
   Mode for IP. Hence CCM MUST be disabled on the Maintenance
   Association of the Base Mode.

   If CCM is required, users MUST configure a separate Maintenance
   association and assign unique value for the corresponding MEP IDs.

   [8021Q] CFM defines MEP ID as an unsigned integer in the range 1 to
   8191. In this document we propose to extend the range to 0 to 65535.
   Value 0 is reserved for MEP ID of Base Mode of IP and MUST NOT be
   used for other purposes.

7.3. Maintenance Domain

   Default MD-LEVEL is set to 3.

7.4. Maintenance Association

   MAID [8021Q] has a flexible format and includes two parts:
   Maintenance Domain Name and Short MA name. In the Based Mode of
   operation, the value of the Maintenance Domain Name must be the
   character string "GenericBaseMode" (excluding the quotes "). In Base
   Mode operation Short MA Name format is set to 2-octet integer format
   (value 3 in Short MA Format field [8021Q]) and Short MA name set to
   65532 (0xFFFC).

11. Acknowledgments

   Giles Heron came up with the idea of developing a YANG model as a way
   of creating a unified OAM API set (interface), work in this document
   is largely an inspiration of that. Alexander Clemm provided many
   valuable tips, comments and remarks that helped to refine the YANG
   model presented in this document.

   Carlos Pignataro, David Ball and others participated contributed to
   this document.
