     Abstract 

        [PWE3 Control] defines the signaling mechanisms for establishing 
        point-to-point pseudowires between two provider edge (PE) nodes. The 
        Generalized ID FEC element contained in PWE3 signaling protocols 
        include TLV fields that identify pseudowire endpoints called 
        attachment individual identifiers (AII). This document defines an AII 
        structure in the form of new AII type-length-value fields that 
        supports AII aggregation for improved scalability. It is envisioned 
        that this would be useful in large inter-domain virtual private wire 
        service networks where pseudowires are established between selected 
        local and remote PE nodes based on customer need.

     1. Introduction 

        [PWE3-CONTROL] defines the signaling mechanisms for establishing 
        point-to-point pseudowires (PWs) between two provider edge (PE) 
        nodes. When a PW is set up, the LDP signaling messages include a FEC 
        element containing information about the PW type and an endpoint

        identifier used in the selection of the PW forwarder that binds the 
        PW to the attachment circuit at each end. 

        There are two types of FEC elements defined for this purpose: PWid 
        FEC (type 128) and the Generalized ID (GID) FEC (type 129). The PWid 
        FEC element includes a fixed-length 32 bit value called the PWid that 
        serves as an endpoint identifier. The same PWid value must be 
        configured on the local and remote PE prior to PW setup. 

        The GID FEC element includes TLV fields for attachment individual 
        identifiers (AII) that, in conjunction with an attachment group 
        identifier (AGI), serve as PW endpoint identifiers. The endpoint 
        identifier on the local PE (denoted as <AGI, source AII or SAII) is 
        called the source attachment identifier (SAI) and the endpoint 
        identifier on the remote PE (denoted as <AGI, target AII or TAII) is 
        called the target attachment identifier (TAI). The SAI and TAI can be 
        distinct values. This is useful for applications and provisioning 
        models where the local PE (with a particular SAI) does not know and 
        must somehow learn (e.g. via MP-BGP auto-discovery) of remote TAI 
        values prior to launching PW setup messages towards the remote PE. 

        The use of the GID FEC TLV provides the flexibility to structure 
        (source or target) AII values to best fit particular application or 
        provisioning model needs [L2VPN-SIG]. For example an AII structure 
        that summarizes or aggregates a large number of individual AII values 
        could significantly reduce the burden on AII distribution mechanisms 
        (e.g. MP-BGP) and on PE memory needed to store this AII information. 
        Note that during the setup process, PW signaling messages would carry 
        fully qualified AII values (as part of the SAI and TAI) and not the 
        AII aggregate.  

        An aggregate AII structure and corresponding IP next hop address 
        could form the basis for enabling inter-domain MS-PW routing and 
        signaling in a manner similar to the way that BGP-advertised IP 
        address prefixes and next hops enable inter-domain IP routing. This 
        would be useful in large inter-domain VPWS networks where PWs are 
        established between local and remote PE based on customer need [REQ-
        MH-PW]. Note that this draft does not discuss if, how, or where in 
        the network the aggregation of AII values is performed, how AII 
        aggregates are distributed nor does it discuss how PW setup messages 
        are routed through a network based on <AII aggregate, IP next hop> 
        tuples. 

        An AII that is globally unique would facilitate PW management and 
        security in large inter-AS and inter-provider environments. Providers 
        would not have to worry about AII value overlap during provisioning 
        or the need for AII ôNATsö during signaling. Globally unique AII

        values could aid in troubleshooting and could be subjected to source-
        validity checks during AII distribution and signaling. 

        An AII that can be automatically derived from a providerÆs existing 
        IP address space can simplify the provisioning process. In addition 
        an AII structure that is backwards compatible with previous endpoint 
        identifier semantics (i.e. PWid) would help providers to converge 
        upon a PW provisioning and signaling behavior employing GID FEC TLVs. 

        In summary the purpose of this draft is to define an AII structure 
        based on [PWE3-CONTROL] that: 

        o  Enables many discrete attachment individual identifiers to be 
           aggregated into a single AII aggregate. This will enhance 
           scalability by reducing the burden on AII distribution mechanisms 
           and on PE memory. 
            

        o  Ensures global uniqueness if desired by the provider. This will 
           facilitate Internet-wide PW connectivity and provide a means for 
           providers to perform source validation on the AII distribution 
           (e.g. MP-BGP) and signaling (e.g. LDP) channels. 
            

        o  Supports a uniform PW signaling mechanism employing the GID FEC 
           TLV structure for endpoints provisioned with the AII types defined 
           in this draft including those previously configured with the older 
           FEC 128 PWid value.  

         

        This is accomplished by defining two new AII types and associated 
        formats of the value fields. 

     2. Proposed Structure for New AII Types 

        The format of the GID FEC TLV is defined in [PWE3-CONTROL] and is 
        illustrated in figure 1:

        In this document the Attachment Group Identifier (AGI) type retains 
        the semantics specified in [PWE3-CONTROL]. Definition of specific AGI 
        types is outside the scope of this document. However if the AGI is 
        non-null, then the SAI consists of the AGI together with the SAII, 
        and the TAI consists of the TAII together with the AGI.  If the AGI 
        is null, then the SAII and TAII are the SAI and TAI respectively. 

        New AII types and the format of their associated AII value fields are 
        defined next. 

     2.1. Short Prefix AII Type 

        The Short Prefix AII type permits varying levels of AII summarization 
        to take place thus reducing the scaling burden on the aforementioned 
        AII distribution mechanisms and PE memory. In other words it no 
        longer becomes necessary to distribute or configure all individual 
        AII values (which could number in the tens of thousands or more) on 
        local PEs prior to establishing PWs to remote PEs. An AII aggregate 
        representing a range of individual candidate AII values on the remote 
        PEs coupled with corresponding IP reachability information leading to 
        the remote PE is all that is required. The next obvious step would be 
        to route a PW setup message containing a fully qualified target AII 
        type towards the IP next hop address associated with the AII

        aggregate. The details of how this is performed are not discussed in 
        this document. 

        The Short Prefix AII type uses a combination of a providerÆs globally 
        unique identifier (Global ID) and a variable length prefix up to 32 
        bits in length to create globally unique AII aggregates. It is termed 
        the Short Prefix AII type because of the shorter 32-bit prefix used 
        here as compared to the longer 256-bit prefix used in the Long Prefix 
        AII type defined in the next section. 

        The encoding of the Short Prefix AII type is shown in figure 2.

        o  Length = length of value field in octets 
            

        o  Flags = One octet flags field reserved for future use. The FLAGS 
           field MUST be set to zero when transmitting a message containing 
           this AII type and MUST BE ignored when receiving a message 
           containing this AII type.

        o  Global ID = This is a 4 octet field containing a value that is 
           unique to the provider. The global ID can contain the 2 octet or 4 
           octet value of the providerÆs Autonomous System Number, a global 
           unicast IPv6 /48 prefix assigned to the provider or some other 
           globally unique value up to 4 octets in length. It is expected 
           that the global ID will be derived from the globally unique AS 
           number of the autonomous system hosting the PEs containing the 
           actual AIIs. If the PE hosting the AIIs is present in an 
           autonomous system where the provider is not running BGP, chooses 
           not to expose this information or does not wish to use the global 
           ID, then the global ID field  MUST be set to zero. If the global 
           ID is derived from a 2-octet AS number, then the high-order 2 
           octets of this 4 octet field MUST be set to zero. 
            
           Please note that the use of the providerÆs AS number as a global 
           ID DOES NOT have anything at all to do with the use AS numberÆs in 
           protocols such as BGP. 
            

        o  Prefix Length = One octet value representing the significant 
           length of the 32-bit prefix in bits. 
            

        o  Prefix = The 32-bit prefix is a value assigned by the provider or 
           it can be automatically derived from the PEÆs /32 IPv4 loopback 
           address. Note that it is not required that the 32-bit prefix have 
           any association with the IPv4 address space used in the providerÆs 
           IGP or BGP for IP reachability. 
            
           If the prefix length is less than 32 then the 32-bit prefix field 
           is padded with zeroes out to 32 bits, but only the first <prefix 
           length> bits are significant. On receipt, bits beyond the first 
           <prefix length> number of bits MUST be ignored.

        o  Attachment Circuit (AC) ID = This is a fixed length four octet 
           field used to further refine identification of an attachment 
           circuit on the PE. For example if the target PE advertises a short 
           prefix AII aggregate representing all of its attachment circuits 
           using a single aggregate value, then the AC ID included in a fully 
           qualified Short Prefix AII Type (i.e. advertised for policy 
           reasons or included in a PW signaling message) can be used to 
           identify specific attachment circuits on that target PE. 
            
           If the AC ID is not present then the AC ID field MUST be null and 
           the AII Length field is set to 9.  
            
           The presence of a non-null AC ID in conjunction with zeroed out 
           global ID and prefix fields (i.e. prefix length equals zero) 
           enables backwards compatibility with PW end-points provisioned 
           with the older FEC 128 PWid value. This may be useful to provider 
           who will to converge upon GID FEC 129 signaling semantics. 

        Here are some examples of how the Short Prefix AII type applies. We 
        assume that the AGI is null and that the prefix where appropriate is 
        auto-generated from the configured /32 IPv4 loopback address of the 
        PE. 

         

        ôAll AIIs located in ASN = 2ö is summarized as: 
         
        AII Type = 0x01 
        Length = variable 
        Flags = 0x00 
        Global ID = 0x00000002 
        Prefix Length = 0 
        Prefix = all zeroes 
        AC ID = null 

        This enables AII aggregation at the ASN level. A provider might use 
        this to advertise AII aggregate ôreachabilityö to other providers in 
        an inter-domain PW provisioning scenario. 

         

        ôAll AIIs contained in ASN = 2 and located on remote PEs with 
        addresses beginning with 192.0.2/24ö is summarized as: 
         
        AII Type = 0x01

        Length = variable 
        Flags = 0x00 
        Global ID = 0x00000002 
        Prefix Length = 24 
        Prefix = 192.0.2.0 
        AC ID = null 
         
        Here we have aggregated all AIIs contained on up to 254 remote PEs in 
        a specific ASN into a single AII aggregate. This would likely apply 
        in an inter-domain case and would be used to limit external AII 
        reachability to just those PEs sharing a common IPv4 prefix.  
         
         

        ôAll AIIs contained on a single remote PE (192.0.2.21) located in ASN 
        = 2ö is summarized as: 
         
        AII Type = 0x01 
        Length = variable 
        Flags = 0x00 
        Global ID = 0x00000002 
        Prefix Length = 32 
        Prefix = 192.0.2.21 
        AC ID = null 
         
        This is per-PE aggregation. Observe that this could be useful in a 
        single-domain environment. A local PE would only need to learn and 
        store the AII aggregate of the remote PE rather then learn and store 
        each individual AII value.    
         

        AS in the previous example but now the provider wants to advertise a 
        couple of specific AC IDs (00000001 and 00000003) on the remote PE of 
        192.0.2.3. Again the analogy is inter-domain routing where providers 
        export more specific routes as a means of expressing routing policy. 
        The provider in this case may wish to express their PW connectivity 
        policies to these two respective attachment circuits on this PE.   
         
        There would now be a single AII aggregate summarized as:   

         

        AII Type = 0x01 
        Length = variable 
        Flags = 0x00 
        Global ID = 0x00000002 
        Prefix Length = 32

        Prefix = 192.0.2.3 
        AC ID = null 
         
        and two discrete AII ôspecificsö encoded as: 
         

        AII Type = 0x01 
        Length = variable 
        Flags = 0x00 
        Global ID = 0x00000002 
        Prefix Length = 32 
        Prefix = 192.0.2.3 
        AC ID = 00000001  

         

        and à  

         

        AII Type = 0x01 
        Length = variable 
        Flags = 0x00 
        Global ID = 0x00000002 
        Prefix Length = 32 
        Prefix = 192.0.2.3 
        AC ID = 00000003 

         
        Note that in this case we have punched a couple of holes into the AII 
        aggregate space that will increase the amount of AII information that 
        must be distributed. 

        And finally here is an example where the global ID is zeroed and 
        combination of the prefix (192.0.2.3) and AC ID (00000004) are used 
        to identify a particular AII: 
         
        AII Type = 0x01 
        Length = variable 
        Flags = 0x00 
        Global ID = 0x00000000 
        Prefix Length = 32 
        Prefix = 192.0.2.3 
        AC ID = 00000004

     2.2. Long Prefix AII Type 

        The Long Prefix AII type employs a global ID and variable-length 
        prefixes up to 256 bits (versus 32 bits for the Short Prefix AII 
        type) in length to create AII values and their aggregates. The Long 
        Prefix AII type might be useful to providers with an NSAP-based 
        provisioning system or who are migrating a network with an NSAP 
        addressing scheme to a network supporting PW connectivity. It can 
        also be used to auto-generate AII aggregates based on /128 IPv6 and 
        /32 IPv4 PE loopbacks. 

        The encoding of the Long Prefix AII type is shown in figure 3:

        o  AII Type = 0x02 
            

        o  Length = length of value field in octets 
            

        o  Flags = One octet flags field reserved for future use. The FLAGS 
           field MUST be set to zero when transmitting a message containing 
           this AII type and MUST BE ignored when receiving a message 
           containing this AII type.

        o  Global ID = This is a 4 octet field containing a value that is 
           unique to the provider. The global ID can contain the 2 octet or 4 
           octet value of the providerÆs Autonomous System Number, a global 
           unicast IPv6 /48 prefix assigned to the provider or some other 
           globally unique value up to 4 octets in length. It is expected 
           that the global ID will be derived from the globally unique AS 
           number of the autonomous system hosting the PEs containing the 
           actual AIIs. If the PE hosting the AIIs is present in an 
           autonomous system where the provider is not running BGP, chooses 
           not to expose this information or does not wish to use the global 
           ID, then the global ID field MUST be set to zero. If the global ID 
           is derived from a 2-octet AS number, then the high-order 2 octets 
           of this 4 octet field MUST be set to zero.  
            
           Please note that the use of the providerÆs AS number as a global 
           ID DOES NOT have anything at all to do with the use AS numberÆs in 
           protocols such as BGP. 
            

        o  Prefix Length = One octet value representing the length of the 
           prefix in bits. 
            

        o  Prefix = The Prefix is a value assigned by the provider or it can 
           be automatically derived from the PEÆs local addressing scheme 
           such as IPv6, NSAP or IPv4.  
            
           If the prefix length is less than 256 then the prefix field is 
           padded with zeroes out to 256 bits, but only the first <prefix 
           length> bits are significant. On receipt, bits beyond the first 
           <prefix length> number of bits MUST be ignored. 
            

        This AII type does not employ an optional AC ID field. This is 
        because there are sufficient bits available in the prefix field to 
        hold a fully qualified target PE value auto-generated from 160 bit 
        NSAP or 128 bit IPv6 addresses with the remainder available for 
        attachment circuit identification. 

        Here is an example of how the Long Prefix AII type applies. Again we 
        assume that the AGI value is null and that the AII aggregate is auto-
        generated from the loopback address of the PE. 

        ôAll AIIs contained on a single remote IPv6 PE 
        (2001:DB8:C003:1:0:0:0:1234) located in ASN = 3ö is summarized as: 
         
        AII Type = 0x02

        Length = variable 
        Flags = 0x00 
        Global ID = 0x00000003 
        Prefix Length = 128 
        Prefix = 2001:DB8:C003:1:0:0:0:1234 
         
        This is an example of per-PE aggregation. Identification of a 
        specific attachment circuit (01) on this PE requires a fully 
        qualified long prefix AII type consisting of: 
         
        AII Type = 0x02 
        Length = variable 
        Flags = 0x00 
        Global ID = 0x00000003 
        Prefix Length = 256 
        Prefix = 2001:DB8:C003:1:0:0:0:1234::01 

         

     3. IANA Considerations 

        This document requests that IANA allocate three AII types from the 
        "Attachment Individual Identifier (AII) Type" registry defined in 
        [IANA]. 

        The suggested values for the AAI types are: 

        Value       Description 

        0x01        Short Prefix AII Type 

        0x02        Long Prefix AII Type 

         

     4. Security Considerations 

        AII values appear in AII distribution protocols [MP-BGP-AUTO-DISC] 
        and PW signaling protocols [PWE3-CONTROL] and are subject to various 
        authentication schemes (i.e. MD5) if so desired.  
         
        The use of global ID values (e.g. ASN) in the inter-provider case 
        could enable a form of source-validation checking to ensure that the 
        AII value (aggregated or explicit) originated from a legitimate 
        source.
