             Signaling Entropy Label Capability Using IS-IS
                       draft-xu-isis-mpls-elc-00

Abstract

   Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) has defined a mechanism to load
   balance traffic flows using Entropy Labels (EL).  An ingress LSR
   cannot insert ELs for packets going into a given tunnel unless an
   egress LSR has indicated via signaling that it can process ELs on
   that tunnel.  This draft defines a mechanism to signal that
   capability using IS-IS.  This mechanism is useful when the label
   advertisement is also done via IS-IS.

1.  Introduction

   Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) has defined a method in
   [RFC6790] to load balance traffic flows using Entropy Labels (EL).
   An ingress LSR cannot insert ELs for packets going into a given
   tunnel unless an egress LSR has indicated via signaling that it can
   process ELs on that tunnel.  [RFC6790] defines the signaling of this
   capability (a.k.a Entropy Label Capability - ELC) via signaling
   protocols.  Recently, mechanisms are being defined to signal labels
   via link state Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP) such as IS-IS
   [I-D.previdi-isis-segment-routing-extensions].  In such scenario the
   signaling mechanisms defined in [RFC6790] are inadequate.  This draft
   defines a mechanism to signal the ELC using IS-IS.  This mechanism is
   useful when the label advertisement is also done via IS-IS.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC6790] and [RFC4971].

3.  Advertising ELC using IS-IS

   The IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV defined in [RFC4971] is used by IS-IS
   routers to announce their capabilities.  A new sub-TLV of this TLV,
   called ELC sub-TLV is defined to advertise the capability of the
   router to process the ELs.  It is formatted as described in [RFC5305]
   with a Type code to be assigned by IANA and a Length of zero.  The
   scope of the advertisement depends on the application but it is
   recommended that it SHOULD be domain-wide.

4.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank Yimin Shen and George Swallow for
   their comments.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes a request to IANA to allocate a sub-TLV type
   within the IS-IS Router Capability TLV.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security considerations.
