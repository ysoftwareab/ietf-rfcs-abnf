                     Use Cases for Video Transport
               draft-you-use-cases-for-video-transport-00

Abstract

   IP video traffic represents a large fraction of Internet traffic.
   How to transmit video traffic efficiently poses traffic management
   challenges to both network operators and Internet applications.

   The traffic characteristics of encoded video have a significant
   impact on the network transport.  This document provides use cases
   where network operator and Internet application can be cooperative to
   improve video transmission efficiency, based on the fundamental
   traffic characteristics (e.g. frame priority, adaptive bit rate,
   etc.).

1.  Introduction

   Video consumption has grown so fast that the bottleneck link is
   congested during peak hours.  Globally, IP video traffic will be 82
   percent of all IP traffic (both business and consumer) by 2020, up
   from 70 percent in 2015. 4K Ultra HD technology is by itself a very
   new trend in the overall electronics landscape, and the impact of it
   is growing month by month. 4K content increases the demand for
   network capacity greatly.  How to transmit video traffic efficiently
   poses traffic management challenges to both network operators and

   Internet applications.  However, the existing video transport schemes
   mainly treat the traffic data in a content agnostic fashion.  Such
   scheduling approaches cannot effectively exploit the limited network
   resources to maximize the perceived quality as video streaming is
   characterized by complex content parameters (e.g., frame priority,
   decoding dependency, etc.).

   This document provides use cases where network operator and Internet
   application can be cooperative to improve video transmission
   efficiency, based on the fundamental traffic characteristics, such as
   frame types (e.g., I, P, or B), adaptive bit rate, etc.  The problem
   of optimizing the delivery of video content to clients while meeting
   the constraints imposed by the available network resources is
   considered.

3.1.  Video Service Experience Evaluation

3.1.1.  Problem Statement

   4K Ultra HD technology is by itself a very new trend in the overall
   electronics landscape, and the impact of it is growing month by
   month.  As the increasing of the implementations of Ultra HD and to
   keep the increasingly sophisticated customers content while remaining
   profitable at the same time, it is important to design and manage the
   video service based on the user quality of experience (QoE) to
   provide attractive 4K video.  Assessing the QoE of 4K video service
   is therefore essential.

   ITU-T Recommendations (see [ITU-T P.1201] and [ITU-T P.1202], for
   instance) define the models to estimate video Mean Opinion Scores
   (MOS).  The video MOS model is applicable to progressive download and
   adaptive streaming where the quality experienced by the end user is
   affected by audio- and video-coding degradations, and delivery
   degradations due to initial buffering, re-buffering (which are both
   perceivable as stalling of the media), and media adaptations.  A
   media adaptation is where the player switches video playback between
   a known set of media quality levels while adapting to network
   conditions.  Each of the quality levels typically differs in a
   significant video or audio or audio/visual quality change.  These
   quality changes are most readily observed by changes in bitrate,
   resolution, frame rate, and similar attributes.

   For the models of estimating video MOS for UHD content, another
   crucial scenario - fault localization for QoE degradation is also
   considered.  For example, an IPTV provider can implement video MOS
   models in their key network devices, such as core router, BRAS
   (Broadband Remote Access Server), and OLT (Optical Line Terminal), to
   locate where a QoE degradation fault happens in an IP video network,
   as shown in figure 1.

   and maintenance purposes.  The network monitoring points are required
   to provide video MOS to the video MOS control center.  By estimating
   the video MOS at different network monitoring points, it is possible
   to perceive several diagnostic signals and reflect the location of
   the impairments on the IP network being measured.

3.1.2.  Information Exposed

   The video MOS model will receive media information and prior
   knowledge about the media stream or streams.  In various modes of
   operation, different inputs may be extracted or estimated in
   different ways.  For example, the video MOS model may need the
   following input signals of operation:

3.2.  Intelligent Packet Dropping

3.2.1.  Problem Statement

   Backbone routers in the Internet are typically configured with
   buffers that are several times larger than the product of the link
   bandwidth and the typical round-trip delay on long network paths.
   Such buffers can delay packets for as much as half a second during
   congestion periods.  When such large queues carry heavy TCP traffic
   loads, and are serviced using the Tail-Drop policy, the large queues
   remain close to full most of the time.  Thus, even if each TCP flow
   is able to obtain its share of the link bandwidth, the end-to-end
   delay remains very high.  This is exacerbated for flows with multiple
   hops, since packets may experience high queuing delays at each hop.

   In order to improve the performance, it is desirable for systems to
   react to current channel conditions using rate adaptive transmission

   technology.  [I-D.you-tsvwg-latency-loss-tradeoff] enables an
   application to request treatment for either low-loss or low-latency
   at a congested network link.  The objective is to retain the best-
   effort service while providing low delay to real-time applications at
   the expense of increased loss or providing low loss to non real-time
   applications at the expense of increased delay.  [DSL-IPD] makes use
   of the fact that some packets containing video information (e.g.,
   I-picture or P-picture) are more important than others (e.g.,
   B-picture), and this importance level can be indicated in the packet
   header.  When congestion in the DSLAM occurs, the low priority
   packets are preferentially dropped.  [IPD] proposes to detect the
   congestion by measuring the length of the queue.  When the buffer
   occupancy increases, the data packets are dropped depending on
   priority assigned to the data packets.  [IPD-TCP] presented DTDRR
   (Dynamic Threshold DRR) and DSDRR (Discard State DRR) as alternatives
   to QSDRR (Queue State DRR) that provide comparable performance, while
   allowing packets to be discarded on arrival, saving memory bandwidth.

   We consider the rate-delay tradeoffs under the assumption that a
   small fraction of packets can be dropped.  It shows that
   intelligently dropping packets can dramatically improve the
   performance in average delay if a non-zero packet drop rate can be
   tolerated.

3.2.2.  Information Exposed

   When congestion is detected, intelligent packet dropping technique is
   implemented to control congestion due to buffer overflow.  The main
   objective is to drop the packets based on priority, so that the
   performance of the network is improved.

   A consequence of these requirements is that packets with lower
   priority are more likely to be dropped during bouts of congestion
   than packets with high priority.  For example, B-frames in video
   transmissions are more likely to be dropped than I-frames when
   congestion.

3.3.  Network Congestion State Feedback

3.3.1.  Problem Statement

   Network congestion typically occurs in the form of router buffer
   overflows, when network nodes are subjected to more traffic than they
   are designed to handle.  With the increasing range of speeds of links
   and the wider use of networks for distributed computing, effective
   control of the network load is becoming more important.  The lack of
   control may result in congestion loss and, with retransmissions, may
   ultimately lead to congestion collapse.

   Network components can be involved in congestion control either
   implicitly or explicitly.  In the former, their operation is
   optimized by properly adjusting the values of a number of free-
   selected parameters, to support the end-to-end congestion control.
   In the latter, feedback signal are issued by explicit signal
   mechanisms, which are typically realized in the network routers.  The
   network device exploits new bits in the packet header to convey
   information regarding the path congestion status back to the
   transmitting source, helping the congestion controller to make the
   necessary decisions towards congestion avoidance.

   [I-D.flinck-mobile-throughput-guidance] proposes that the cellular
   network provides information on throughput guidance to the TCP
   server; this information will indicate the throughput estimated to be
   available at the radio downlink interface.  The throughput guidance
   information is added into the Options field of the TCP header of
   packets from the TCP client to the TCP server.  In our use case, for
   example, if video is encoded in multiple bitrates, the application
   server can select the appropriate encoding based on the network
   conditions.  Similar use case is also discussed in
   [I-D.kuehlewind-spud-use-cases].

3.3.2.  Information Exposed

   The interesting feature of explicit signaling scheme is the use of a
   minimal amount of feedback from the network to users to enable them
   to control the amount of traffic allowed into the network.  The
   routers in the network detect congestion and insert this information
   into packets flowing in the forward direction.  This information is
   communicated back to the users by the destination that receives the
   packets.  This feedback information is examined by the user to
   control the amount of traffic that is placed on the network, for
   example by setting the control-related TCP properties.  This
   information enables switching of video quality to an appropriate bit-
   rate based on the network congestion state, and preserving the
   important visual information to be transmitted.

4.  Security Considerations

   Trust relationship between network and user is needed as the provided
   information leads to the accuracy of the video MOS (section 4.1) or
   differentiated operations by both sides (section 4.2 and 4.3).
