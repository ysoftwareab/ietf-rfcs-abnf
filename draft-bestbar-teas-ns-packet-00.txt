              Realizing Network Slices in IP/MPLS Networks
                    draft-bestbar-teas-ns-packet-00

Abstract

   Network slicing provides the ability to partition a physical network
   into multiple isolated logical networks of varying sizes, structures,
   and functions so that each slice can be dedicated to specific
   services or customers.  Network slices need to operate in parallel
   with varying degrees of isolation while providing slice elasticity in
   terms of network resource allocation.  The Differentiated Service
   (Diffserv) model allows for carrying multiple services on top of a
   single physical network by relying on compliant nodes to apply
   specific forwarding treatments on to packets that carry the
   respective Diffserv code point.  This document proposes a solution
   based on the Diffserv model to realize network slicing in IP/MPLS
   networks.  The proposed solution is agnostic to the path control
   technology used in the network slicing domain and allows service
   differentiation of traffic within a given network slice.

Internet-Draft           IP/MPLS Network Slicing            October 2020


1.  Introduction

   Network slicing allows a Service Provider, or a network operator to
   create independent and isolated logical networks on top of a common
   or shared physical network infrastructure.  Such network slices can
   be offered to customers or used internally by the Service Provider to
   facilitate or enhance their service offerings.  A Service Provider
   can also use network slicing to structure and organize the elements
   of its infrastructure.  For example, certain network resource
   capabilities and functionality can be grouped together providing a
   self-contained unit (network slice) of varying size and complexity.

   When logical networks representing network slices are realized on top
   of a shared physical network, it is important to steer traffic on the
   specific network resources allocated for the network slice.  In
   packet networks, the packets that traverse a specific network slice
   MAY be identified by specific field(s) carried within the packet.  A
   network slice boundary node will usually mark or populate the
   respective field(s) in packets that enter a network slice to allow
   interior slice nodes to identity those packets and apply the specific
   Per Hop Behavior (PHB) that is associated with the slice and that
   defines the scheduling treatment and, in some cases, the packet drop
   probability.

   In a Differentiated Service (Diffserv) domain [RFC2475], packets
   requiring the same forwarding treatment are classified and marked
   with a Class Selector (CS) at domain ingress nodes.  At transit
   nodes, the CS field inside the packet is inspected to determine the
   specific forwarding treatment to be applied before the packet is
   forwarded further.

   Multiple network slices can be realized on top of a shared physical
   infrastructure network.  A single network slice may also support
   multiple forwarding treatments or Diffserv classes that can be
   carried over the same logical network slice.  This document proposes
   a solution that allows proper placement of paths and respective
   treatment of traffic traversing network slice resource(s) in IP/MPLS
   networks.  The network slice traffic may be marked at slice boundary
   nodes with a Slice Selector (SS) to allow routers to apply a specific
   forwarding treatment that guarantees the slice Service Level
   Agreements (SLAs).  Network slice traffic may further carry a
   Diffserv CS to allow differentiation of forwarding treatments for
   packets forwarded over the same network slice network resources.

   For example, when using MPLS as a dataplane, it is possible to
   identify packets belonging to the same slice by carrying a global
   MPLS Slice Selector Label (SSL) in the MPLS label stack that
   identifies the slice in each packet.  Additional Diffserv

   classification may be indicated in the MPLS Traffic Class (TC) bits
   of the SSL to allow further differentiation of traffic treatments of
   traffic traversing the same slice network resources.

1.3.  Scope

   The definition of Network Slice for use within the IETF and the
   characteristics of IETF Network Slice are specified in
   [I-D.draft-nsdt-teas-transport-slice-definition-04].  A framework for
   reusing IETF VPN and traffic-engineering technologies to realize IETF
   Network Slices is discussed in [I-D.draft-nsdt-teas-ns-framework-04].

   This document provides a solution that addresses the network slice
   requirements in packet networks from a device and network resource
   level perspective based on DiffServ principles.

2.  Network Resource Slicing Membership

   A network slice can span multiple parts of an IP/MPLS network (e.g.
   all or specific network resources in the access, aggregation, or core
   network), and can stretch across multiple operator domains.  A
   network slice may include all or a sub-set of the physical nodes and
   links of an IP/MPLS network, and it may be comprised of dedicated
   and/or shared network resources (e.g. in terms of processing power,
   storage, and bandwidth) and may have varying degrees of isolation
   from the other network slices.

2.1.  Dedicated Network Resources

   Physical network resources may be fully dedicated to a specific
   network slice.  For example, this allows traffic belonging to a slice
   to traverse the dedicated resources without network resource
   contention from traffic of another network slice.  Dedicated network
   resource slicing allows for simple partitioning of the physical
   network resources into multiple isolated network slices without the
   need to distinguish packets traversing the dedicated network
   resources since only one slice traffic can use them.

2.2.  Shared Network Resources

   To optimize network utilization, sharing of the physical network
   resources may be desirable.  In such case, the same physical network
   resource capacity is partitioned among logical network slice(s).
   Shared network resources can be partitioned in the dataplane (for
   example by applying hardware policers and shapers), partitioned in
   the control plane by providing a logical representation of the
   physical link that has a subset of the network resources available to
   it.

3.  Path Selection

   Path selection in a network can be network state dependent, or
   network state independent as described in Section 5 of
   [I-D.draft-dt-teas-rfc3272bis-11].  The latter is the choice commonly
   used by IGP(s) when selecting a best path to a destination prefix,
   while the former is used by ingress TE routers, or Path Computation
   Engines (PCEs) when optimizing the placement of a flow based on the
   current network resource utilization.

   For example, when steering traffic on a delay optimized path, the IGP
   can use its Link State Database (LSDB)'s view of the network topology
   to compute a path optimizing for the delay metric of each link in the
   network resulting in a cumulative lowest delay path.

   When path selection is network state dependent, the path computation
   can leverage Traffic Engineering mechanisms (e.g. as defined in
   [RFC2702]) to compute feasible paths taking into account the incoming
   traffic demand rate and current state of network.  This allows
   avoiding overly utilized link(s), and reduces the chance of
   congestion on traversed link(s).

   To enable TE path placement, the link state is advertised with
   current reservation(s), thereby reflecting the available bandwidth on
   each link.  Such link reservations may be maintained centrally on a
   network wide network resource manager, or distributed on devices (as

Internet-Draft           IP/MPLS Network Slicing            October 2020


   usually done with RSVP).  TE extensions exist today to allow IGPs
   (e.g.  [RFC3630] and [RFC5305]), and BGP-LS [RFC7752] to advertise
   such link state reservations.

   When network resource reservations are also slice aware, the link
   state can carry per network slice state (e.g. per network slice link
   reservable bandwidth).  This allows path computation to take into
   account the specific network resources available for a network slice
   when determining the path for a specific flow.  In this case, we
   refer to the process of path placement and path provisioning has
   Slice-aware Traffic Engineering (Slice-aware TE).

4.  Approaches to Network Resource Slicing

   The partitioning of the shared network resources amongst multiple
   slices can be achieved in:

   a)  control plane only, or

   b)  data plane only, or

   c)  both control and data planes.

4.1.  Data Plane Network Resource Slicing

   The physical network resources can be partitioned on network devices
   by applying a Per-Hop forwarding Behavior (PHB) onto packets that
   traverse the network device(s).  In the Diffserv model, a Class
   Selector (CS) is carried in the packet and is used by transit node(s)
   to apply the PHB that determines the scheduling treatment and, in
   some cases, drop probability for packet(s).

   When dataplane network resource slicing is required, packets need to
   be forwarded on the specific slice network resources and be applied a
   specific forwarding treatment that is dictated by the Slice Per-Hop
   Definition (Slice-PHD) (refer to Section 5.2 below) consumed by each
   device.  A slice Selector (SS) MAY be carried in each slice packet to
   identify the slice that it belongs to.

   The ingress node of a slice domain, in addition to marking packets
   with a Diffserv CS, MAY also add a SS to each slice packet.  The
   transit node(s) within a slice domain MAY use the SS to associate
   packets with a slice and to determine the Slice Per Hop Behavior
   (Slice-PHB) that is applied to the packet (refer to Section 5.2.3 for
   further details).  The CS MAY be used to apply a Diffserv PHB on to
   the packet to allow differentiation of traffic treatment within the
   same network slice.

Internet-Draft           IP/MPLS Network Slicing            October 2020


   When dataplane only network resource slicing is desirable, routers
   may rely on a network state independent view of the topology to
   determine the best path(s) to reach destination(s).  In this case,
   the best path selection dictates the forwarding path of packets to
   the destination.  The SS that is carried in each packet determines
   the specific Slice-PHB treatment for each slice along the selected
   path.

   For example, Segment-Routing flexible algorithm may be deployed in a
   network to steer packet(s) on the lowest cumulative delay.  A Slice-
   PHD may be used to enable the link(s) along the least latency path
   for dataplane slicing.  Network slice packet(s) forwarded along the
   lowest delay path can carry the SS when forwarded along the least
   latency path.  Transit nodes along the lowest delay path can inspect
   the SS and Diffserv CS to determine the Slice-PHB and the Diffserv
   class PHB to apply to packets before they are forwarded downstream.

4.2.  Control Plane Network Resource Slicing

   The physical network resources in the network can be logically
   partitioned by having a representation of network resources appear in
   a virtual topology.  The virtual topology can contain all or a subset
   of the physical network resource(s).  The logical network resources
   that appear in the virtual topology can reflect a part, whole, or in-
   excess of the physical network resource capacity (when
   oversubscription is desirable).  For example, a physical link
   bandwidth can be divided into fractions, each belonging to a slice.
   Each fraction of the physical link bandwidth can be represented as a
   logical link in a virtual topology that is used when determining
   path(s) in a specific slice.  The per slice virtual network can be
   used by routing protocol(s), or by the ingress/PCE when computing
   slice aware path(s).

   To perform network state dependent path computation in each slice,
   the resource reservation on each link needs to be slice aware (Slice-
   aware TE).  Depending on the network Slice-PHD, a physical link may
   be part of one or more slice(s).  Each such link may be sliced 'n'
   ways so that each slice will have certain network resources
   associated with it.  The per slice network resource availability on
   link(s) are updated (and may eventually be advertised in the network)
   when new path(s) are placed in the network.  The per slice resource
   reservation, in this case, can be maintained on each device(s) or be
   centralized on a resource reservation manager that holds link
   reservation state(s) on links in the network.

   A number of network slice(s) can share the available network
   resource(s) allocated to each network slice amongst a group.  In this
   case, a node can update the reservable bandwidth for each slice to

   take into consideration the available bandwidth from other slice(s)
   in the same group.

   For illustration purposes, the diagram below represents bandwidth
   isolation or sharing amongst a group of network slice(s).  In
   Figure 1a, the network slices: Slice1, Slice2, Slice3 and Slice4 are
   not sharing any bandwidths between each other.  In Figure 1b, the
   network slices: Slice1 and Slice2 can share the available bandwidth
   portion allocated to each amongst them.  Similarly, Slice3 and Slice4
   can share amongst themselves any available bandwidth allocated to
   them, but they cannot share available bandwidth allocated to Slice1
   or Slice2.  In both cases, the Max Reservable Bandwidth may exceed
   the actual physical link resource capacity to allow for over
   subscription.

4.3.  Data and Control Plane Network Resource Slicing

   In order to support strict guarantees and hard isolation between
   network slice(s), the network resource(s) can be partitioned in both
   the control plane and data plane.

   The control plane partitioning allows the creation of customized
   topologies per slice that router(s) or a Path Computation Engine

   (PCE) can use to determine optimal path placement for specific demand
   flows (Slice-aware TE).

   The data plane partitioning protects slice traffic from network
   resource contention that occurs due to bursts in traffic from
   different slice(s) traversing the same shared network resource.

5.  Network Slice Instantiation

   A network slice can span multiple technologies and multiple
   administrative domains.  Depending on the network slice consumer's
   requirements, a network slice can be isolated from other network
   slices in terms of data, control or management planes.

   The instantiation of a network slice may necessitate a network Slice
   Manager or service orchestrator that accepts a Service Layer Slice
   Intent as input and is translates it to a network wide device
   specific Slice-PHD as shown in Figure 2.

   The Diffserv procedures may be employed within the same network slice
   to realize multiple classes of traffic belonging to the same slice.

5.1.  Slice Intent

   A network slicing solution may be realized using a network slice
   service Layer, and a device/resource Layer.  The service layer can be
   managed by a service orchestrator that exposes a north bound
   interface to slice consumers that can be used to convey the intent.
   Depending on the use cases and type of services for which the end-to-
   end slice is instantiated, multiple levels of control may be exposed
   to the tenants by a slice provider.

   For example, network slicing provider may allow for a connectivity
   and data processing that is tailored to specific customer
   requirements.  At the service layer, the consumer of a network slice
   expresses their intent for a particular network slice by specifying
   requirements rather than how a slice is realized.  The requirements
   for a network slice can vary and can be expressed in terms of
   connectivity needs between end-points (point-to-point, point-to-
   multipoint or multipoint-to-multipoint) with customizable network
   capabilities that may include data speed, quality, latency,
   reliability, security, and services (refer to
   [I-D.draft-nsdt-teas-transport-slice-definition-04] for more
   details).  These capabilities are always provided based on a Service
   Level Agreement (SLA) between the network slice consumer and the
   provider.

   The network slice orchestrator is responsible for translating the
   network slice consumer intent into a Slice-PHD that can be
   instantiated by network elements at Device/Resource layer so that the
   network slice consumer requirements in terms of network
   characteristics are met.

5.2.  Slice Per-Hop Definition

   The high-level slice intent is consumed to produce a set of features
   and attributes that can be provisioned on network elements.  The
   device level Slice-PHD includes attributes related to:

   o  Dataplane specific properties: This includes the SS, any firewall
      rules or flow-spec filters, and QoS profiles associated with the
      slice and any classes within it.

   o  Control plane specific properties: This includes guaranteed
      bandwidth, any network resource sharing amongst slice(s), and
      slice reservation preference to prioritize any reservations of a
      specific slice over others.

Internet-Draft           IP/MPLS Network Slicing            October 2020


   o  Membership policies: This defines policies that dictate node/link/
      function network resource topology association for a specific
      slice.

   There is a desire for flexibility in implementing network slices to
   support the services across networks consisting of products from
   multiple vendors, and may be grouped into disparate domains and using
   various path control technologies and tunnel types.  It is expected
   that having a standardized data model for a Slice-PHD will facilitate
   the instantiation of a network slice on a network slicing capable
   node.

   It is also possible to deliver a Slice-PHD to network devices using
   several mechanisms, including using protocols such as NETCONF or
   RESTCONF, or exchanging it using a suitable routing protocol that
   network devices participate in (such as IGP(s) or BGP).

5.2.1.  Slice Data Plane Selector

   A router MUST be able to identify a packet as belonging to a network
   slice before it can apply the proper forwarding treatment or PHB
   associated with the slice.  One or more fields within the packet MAY
   be selected as a SS to do this.

   Per Slice Forwarding Address:

      One approach to distinguish packets targeted to a destination but
      belong to different slices is to assign multiple forwarding
      addresses (or multiple MPLS label bindings in the case of MPLS
      network) to the same destination - one for each slice the
      destination can be reached over.  For example, when realizing a
      network slice over an IP dataplane, the same destination can be
      assigned multiple IP addresses (or multiple SRv6 locators in the
      case of SRv6 network) to enable steering of traffic to the same
      destination over multiple network slices.

      Similarly, when an MPLS dataplane is used, [RFC3031] states in
      Section 2.1 that: 'Some routers analyze a packet's network layer
      header not merely to choose the packet's next hop, but also to
      determine a packet's "precedence" or "class of service'.  In such
      case, the same destination can be assigned multiple MPLS label
      bindings corresponding to an LSP that traverses network resources
      of a specific slice towards the destination.

      The specific slice forwarding address (or MPLS forwarding label)
      can be carried in the packet belonging to a network slice to allow
      (IP or MPLS) routers along the path to identify the packets and
      apply the respective per Slice-PHB and forwarding treatment.  This

      approach requires maintaining per slice state for each destination
      in the network in both the control and data plane and on each
      router in the network.

      For example, consider a network slicing provider with a network
      composed of 'N' nodes, each with 'K' adjacencies to its neighbors.
      Assuming a node is reachable in as many as 'M' network slice(s),
      the node will have to assign and advertise reachability for 'N'
      unique forwarding addresses, or MPLS forwarding labels
      corresponding to the 'N' slices.  Similarly, each node will have
      to assign a unique forwarding address (or MPLS forwarding label)
      for each of its 'K' adjacencies to enable strict steering over
      each.  Consequently, the control plane at any node in the network
      will need to store as many as (N+K)*M states.  In addition, a node
      will have to store and program (N+K)*M forwarding addresses or
      labels entries in its Forwarding Information Base (FIB) to realize
      this.  Therefore, as 'N', 'K', and 'M' parameters increase, this
      approach will have scalability challenges both in the control and
      data planes.

   Per Slice Selector:

      A Slice Selector (SS) field can be carried in each packet to
      identify the packet belonging to a specific slice, independent of
      the forwarding address or MPLS forwarding label that is bound to
      the destination.  Routers within the network slice domain can use
      the forwarding address (or MPLS forwarding label) to determine the
      forwarding path, and use the SS field in the packet to determine
      the specific Slice-PHB that gets applied on the packet.  This
      approach allows better scale since it relies on a single
      forwarding address or MPLS label binding to be used independent of
      the number of network slices required along the path.  In this
      case, the additional SS field will need to be carried, and
      maintained in each packet while it traverses the slice domain.

      The SS can be carried in one of multiple fields within the packet,
      depending on the dataplane type used.  For example in MPLS
      networks, the SS can be represented as a global MPLS label that is
      carried in the packet's MPLS label stack.  All packets that belong
      to the same slice MAY carry the same SS label in the MPLS label
      stack.  It is possible, as well, to have multiple SS label(s)
      point to the same Slice-PHB.

      The MPLS SS Label (SSL) may appear in several positions in the
      MPLS label stack.  For example, the MPLS SSL can be maintained at
      the top of the label stack while the packet is forwarded along the
      MPLS path.  In this case, the forwarding at each hop is determined
      by the forwarding label that resides below the SSL.  Figure 3

      shows an example where the SSL appears at the top of MPLS label
      stack in a packet.  PE1 is a network Slice edge node that receives
      the packet that needs to be steered over a slice specific MPLS
      Path.  PE1 computes the SR Path composed of the Label Segment-
      List={9012, 9023}. It imposes a SSL=1001 corresponding to Slice-
      ID=1001 followed by the SR Path Segment-List.  At P1, the top
      label sets the context of the packet to Slice-ID=1001.  The
      forwarding of the packet is determined by inspecting the
      forwarding label (below the SSL) within the context of SSL.

      The SSL can also reside at the bottom of the label stack.  For
      example, the VPN service label may also be used as an SSL which
      allows steering of traffic towards one or more egress PEs over the
      same network slice.  In such cases, one or more service labels MAY
      be mapped to the same slice.  The same VPN label may also be
      allocated on all Egress PEs so it can serve as a single SSL for a
      specific network slice.  Alternatively, a range of SSL (VPN
      labels) may be mapped to a single network slice to allow carrying
      multiple VPN(s) over the same network slice as shown in Figure 4.

      In some cases, the position of the SSL may not be at a fixed place
      in the MPLS label header.  In this case, transit routers cannot
      expect the SSL at a fixed place in the MPLS label stack.  This can
      be addressed by introducing a new Special Purpose Label from the
      label reserved space called a Slice Selector Label Indicator
      (SSLI).  The slice network ingress boundary node, in this case,
      will need to impose at least two additional MPLS labels (SSLI +
      SSL) to identify the slice that the packets belong to as shown in
      Figure 5.

      When the slice is realized over an IP dataplane, the SSL can be
      encoded in the IP header.  For example, the SSL can be encoded in
      portion of the IPv6 Flow Label field as described in
      [I-D.draft-filsfils-spring-srv6-stateless-slice-id-01].

5.2.2.  Slice Network Resource Reservation

   Bandwidth and network resource allocation strategies for network
   slicing are essential to achieve optimal placement of paths within
   the network while still meeting the target SLOs.

   Resource reservation allows for the managing of available bandwidth
   and for prioritization of existing allocations to enable preference
   based preemption when contention on a specific network resource
   arises.  Sharing of a network resource's available bandwidth amongst
   a group of slices may also be desirable.  For example, a slice may
   not always be using all of its reservable bandwidth; this allows
   other slices in the same group to use the available bandwidth
   resources.

Internet-Draft           IP/MPLS Network Slicing            October 2020


   Congestion on shared network resources may result from sub-optimal
   placement of paths in different network slices.  When this occurs,
   preemption of some slice specific paths may be desirable to alleviate
   congestion.  A preference based allocation scheme enables
   prioritization of slice paths that can be preempted.

   Since network characteristics and its state can change over time, the
   per slice topology and its state also needs to be propagated in the
   network to enable ingress TE routers or Path Computation Engine
   (PCEs) to perform accurate path placement based on the current state
   of the network slice.

5.2.3.  Slice Per-Hop Behavior

   In Diffserv terminology, the forwarding behavior that is assigned to
   a specific class is called a Per-Hop Behavior (PHB).  The PHB defines
   the forwarding precedence that a marked packet with a specific CS
   receives in relation to other traffic on the Diffserv-aware network.

   A Slice Per Hop Behavior (Slice-PHB) is the externally observable
   forwarding behavior applied to a specific packet belonging to a
   slice.  The goal of a Slice-PHB is to provide a specified amount of
   network resources for traffic belonging to a specific slice.  A
   single network slice may also support multiple forwarding treatments
   or services that can be carried over the same logical network slice.

   The slice traffic may be identified at slice boundary nodes by
   carrying a SS to allow router(s) to apply a specific forwarding
   treatment that guarantee the slice SLA(s).

   With Differentiated Services (Diffserv) it is possible to carry
   multiple service(s) over a single converged network.  Packets
   requiring the same forwarding treatment are marked with a Class
   Selector (CS) at domain ingress nodes.  Up to eight classes or
   Behavior Aggregated (BAs) may be supported for a given Forwarding
   Equivalence Class (FEC) [RFC2475].  To support multiple services over
   the same network slice, a slice packet MAY also carry a Diffserv CS
   to identify the specific Diffserv forwarding treatment to be applied
   on the different service traffic belonging to the same slice.

   At transit nodes, the CS field carried inside the packets are used to
   determine the specific Per Hop Behavior (PHB) that determines the
   forwarding and scheduling treatment before packets are forwarded, and
   in some cases, drop probability for each packet.

5.2.4.  Slice Topology Membership

   A network slice is built on top of a customized topology that may
   include the full or subset of the physical network topology.  The
   network slice topology could also span multiple administrative
   domains and/or multiple dataplane technologies.

   The network slice topology can overlap or share a subset of links
   with another network slice topology.  A number of policies or
   topology filters can be defined to limit the specific topology
   elements that belong to a network slice.

   The Slice-PHD membership can carry the topology filtering policies.
   For example, such policies can leverage Resource Affinities as
   defined in [RFC2702] to include or exclude certain link(s) in a
   specific network slice topology.  The Slice-PHD may also include a
   reference to a predefined topology (e.g. derived from from a Flexible
   Algorithm Definition (FAD) as defined in [I-D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo], or
   Multi-Topology ID as defined [RFC4915].

   Alternatively, the topology filtering policies can specify specific
   link properties (such as delay, bandwidth capacity, security) to
   filter/include such link(s) in a network slice topology.

5.3.  Network Slice Boundary

   A network slice originates at the boundary of a network slice
   provider at edge node(s).  Traffic that is steered over the network
   slice may traverse network slicing capable interior nodes, as well
   as, network slicing incapable interior nodes.

   The network slice may compose of one or more administrative
   domain(s); for example, an organization's intranet or an ISP.  The
   administration of the network is responsible for ensuring that
   adequate network resources are provisioned and/or reserved to support
   the SLAs offered by the network end-to-end.

5.3.1.  Network Slice Edge Nodes

   Network slicing edge nodes sit at the boundary of a network slice
   provider network and receive traffic that requires steering over
   network resources specific to a network slice.  The slice edge nodes
   are responsible for identifying network slice specific traffic flows
   by possibly inspecting multiple fields from inbound packets (e.g.
   implementations may inspect IP traffic's network 5-tuple in the IP
   and transport protocol headers) to decide on which network slice it
   can be forwarded.

Internet-Draft           IP/MPLS Network Slicing            October 2020


   Network slice ingress nodes may condition the inbound traffic at
   network boundaries in accordance with the requirements or rules of
   each service's SLA(s).  The requirements and rules for network slice
   services are set using mechanisms which are outside the scope of this
   document.

   When dataplane slicing is required, the slice boundary nodes are
   responsible for adding a suitable SS onto packets that belong to
   specific network slices.  In addition, edge nodes MAY mark the
   corresponding Diffserv CS to differentiate between different types of
   traffic carried over the same network slice.

5.3.2.  Network Slice Interior Nodes

   A network slice interior node receives slice traffic and MAY be able
   to identify the packets belonging to a specific network slice by
   inspecting the SS field carried inside each packet, or by inspecting
   other fields within the packet that may identify specific flows
   belonging to a specific network slice.  For example when dataplane
   slicing is required, interior nodes can use the SS carried within the
   packet to apply the corresponding Slice-PHB forwarding behavior.
   Nodes within the network slice provider network may also inspect the
   Diffserv CS within each packet to apply a per Diffserv class PHB
   within the network slice, and allow differentiation of forwarding
   treatments for packets forwarded over the same network slice network
   resources.

5.3.3.  Network Slice Incapable Nodes

   Packets that belong to a network slice may need to traverse nodes
   that are incapable of network slicing.  In this case, several options
   are possible to allow the network slice traffic to continue to be
   forwarded over such devices and be able to resume the network slice
   forwarding treatment once the traffic reaches devices that are
   capable of network slicing.

   When dataplane network slicing is desirable, packets carry a SS to
   allow slice interior nodes to identify them.  To enable end-to-end
   network slicing, the SS MUST be maintained in the packets as they
   traverse devices within the network - including devices incapable of
   network slicing.

   For example, when the SS is an MPLS label at the bottom of the MPLS
   label stack, packets can traverse over devices that are incapable of
   network slicing without any further considerations.  On the other
   hand, when the SSL is at the top of the MPLS label stack, packets can
   be bypassed (or tunneled) over the network slicing incapable devices

5.3.4.  Combining Network Resource Slicing Approaches

   It is possible to employ a combination of the approaches that were
   discussed in Section 4 to realize an end-to-end network slice.  For
   example, data and control plane network resource slicing can be
   employed in parts of a network, while control plane only slicing can
   be employed in the other parts of the network.  The Slice-aware path
   selection in such case can take into account the per slice available
   network resources.  Packets carry a SS within them so the
   corresponding Slice-PHB can be enforced on the parts of the network
   that realize dataplane network resource slicing.  The SS can be

Internet-Draft           IP/MPLS Network Slicing            October 2020


   maintained while traffic traverses nodes that do not enforce any
   dataplane slicing, and so slice PHB enforcement can resume once
   traffic traverses slicing capable nodes.

5.4.  Slice Traffic Steering

   The usual techniques to steer traffic onto paths can be applicable
   when steering traffic over paths established in a specific network
   slice.

   For example, one or more (layer-2 or layer-3) VPN services can be
   directly mapped to paths established in a specific network slice.  In
   this case, traffic that arrives on the Provider Edge (PE) router over
   external interface(s) can be directly mapped to a specific network
   slice path.  External interface(s) can be further partitioned (e.g.
   using VLANs) to allow mapping one or more VLANs to specific network
   slice paths.

   Another option is steer specific destinations directly over specific
   network slices.  This allows traffic arriving on any external
   interface and targeted to such destinations to be directly steered
   over the slice transport paths.

   A third option that can also be used is to utilize a dataplane
   firewall filter or classifier to enable matching of several fields in
   the incoming packets to decide whether the packet is steered on a
   specific slice.  This option allows for applying a rich set of
   rule(s) to identify specific packets to be mapped to a network slice.
   However, it requires dataplane network resources to be able to
   perform the additional checks in hardware.

6.  Control Plane Extensions

   Routing protocol(s) may need to be extended to carry additional per
   slice link state.  For example, [RFC5305], [RFC3630], and [RFC7752]
   are ISIS, OSPF, and BGP protocol extensions to exchange network link
   state information to allow ingress TE routers and PCE(s) to do proper
   path placement in the network.  The extensions required to support
   network slicing may be defined in other document(s), and are outside
   the scope of this document.

   The provisioning of the network slicing device Slice-PHD may need to
   be automated.  Multiple options are possible to facilitate automation
   of provisioning a network slice definition on device(s) that are
   capable of network slicing.

   For example, a YANG data model for the network Slice-PHD may be
   supported on network devices and controllers.  A suitable transport

Internet-Draft           IP/MPLS Network Slicing            October 2020


   (e.g.  NETCONF [RFC6241], RESTCONF [RFC8040], or gRPC) may be used to
   enable configuration and retrieval of state information for network
   slicing on network device(s).  The network Slice-PHD YANG data model
   may be defined in a separate document, and is outside the scope of
   this document.

7.  Applicability to Path Control Technologies

   The network slicing approach(s) described in this document are
   agnostic to the technology used to setup path(s) that carry
   networking slice traffic.  Once feasible path(s) within a network
   slice are selected, it is possible to use RSVP-TE protocol [RFC3209]
   to setup or signal the LSP(s) that would be used to carry slice
   traffic.  Specific extension(s) to RSVP-TE protocol to enable
   signaling of slice aware RSVP LSP(s) are outside the scope and will
   be tackled in a separate document(s).

   Alternatively, Segment Routing (SR) [RFC8402] may be used and the
   feasible path(s) can realized by steering over specific segment(s) or
   segment-list(s) using an SR policy.  Further detail(s) on how the
   approach(es) presented in this document can be realized over an SR
   network will be tackled in a separate document.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

9.  Security Considerations

   The main goal of network slicing is to allow for some level of
   isolation for traffic from multiple different network slices that are
   utilizing a common network infrastructure and to allow for different
   levels of services to be provided for traffic traversing a single
   network slice resource(s).

   A variety of techniques may be used to achieve this, but the end
   result will be that some packets may be mapped to specific
   resource(s) and may receive different (e.g., better) service
   treatment than others.  The mapping of network traffic to a specific
   slice is indicated primarily by the SS, and hence an adversary may be
   able to utilize resource(s) allocated to a specific network slice by
   injecting packets carrying the same SS field in their packets.

   Such theft-of-service may become a denial-of-service attack when the
   modified or injected traffic depletes the resources available to
   forward legitmiate traffic belonging to a specific network slice.

Internet-Draft           IP/MPLS Network Slicing            October 2020


   The defense against this type of theft and denial-of-service attacks
   consists of the combination of traffic conditioning at network
   slicing domain boundaries with security and integrity of the network
   infrastructure within a network slicing domain.
