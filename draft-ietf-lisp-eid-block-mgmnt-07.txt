                  LISP EID Block Management Guidelines
                 draft-ietf-lisp-eid-block-mgmnt-07.txt

Abstract

   This document proposes a framework for the management of the LISP EID
   Address Block.  The framework described relies on hierarchical
   distribution of the address space, granting temporary usage of
   prefixes of such space to requesting organizations.

1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP - [RFC6830]) and related
   mechanisms ([RFC6831], [RFC6832], [RFC6833], [RFC6834], [RFC6835],
   [RFC6836], [RFC6837]) separate the IP addressing space into two
   logical spaces, the End-point IDentifier (EID) space and the Routing
   LOCator (RLOC) space.  The first space is used to identify
   communication end-points, while the second is used to locate EIDs in
   the Internet routing infrastructure topology.

   The document [I-D.ietf-lisp-eid-block] requested an IPv6 address
   block reservation exclusively for use as EID prefixes in the LISP
   experiment.  The rationale, intent, size, and usage of the EID
   address block are described in [I-D.ietf-lisp-eid-block].

   This document proposes a management framework for the registration of
   EID prefixes from that block, allowing the requesting organization
   exclusive use of those EID prefixes limited to the duration of the
   LISP experiment.


3.  Definition of Terms

   This document does not introduce any new terms related to the set of
   LISP Specifications ([RFC6830], [RFC6831], [RFC6832], [RFC6833],
   [RFC6834], [RFC6835], [RFC6836], [RFC6837]), but assumes that the
   reader is familiar with the LISP terminology.
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-introduction] provides an introduction to the LISP
   technology, including its terminology. .


4.  EID Prefix Registration Policy

   The request for registration of EID prefixes MUST be done under the
   following policies:

   1.  EID prefixes are made available in the reserved space on a
       temporary basis and for experimental uses.  The requester of an
       experimental prefix MUST provide a short description of the
       intended use or experiment that will be carried out (see
       Section 6).  If the prefix will be used for activities not



Iannone, et al.          Expires October 8, 2016                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft          LISP EID Block Management             April 2016


       documented in the original description, the renewal of the
       registration may be denied.

   2.  EID prefix registrations MUST be renewed on a regular basis to
       ensure their use by active participants in the experiment.  The
       registration period is 12 months.  A renewal SHOULD NOT cause a
       change in the EID prefix registered in the previous request.  The
       conditions of registration renewal are the same as the conditions
       of first EID prefix registration request.

   3.  It is preferable not to reuse EID prefixes whose registration is
       expired.  When an EID prefix registration is removed from the
       registry, then the reuse of the EID prefix in a subsequent
       registration on behalf of a different end user should be avoided
       where possible.  If the considerations of overall usage of the
       EID block prefix requires reuse of a previously registered EID
       prefix, then a minimum delay of at least one week between removal
       and subsequent registration SHOULD be applied by the registry
       operator.

   4.  All registrations of EID prefixes cease at the time of the
       expiration of the reserved experimental LISP EID Block.  The
       further disposition of these prefixes and the associated registry
       entries is to be specified in the announcement of the cessation
       of this experiment.


5.  EID Prefixes Registration Requirements

   All EID prefix registrations MUST respect the following requirements:

   1.  All EID prefix registrations MUST use a globally unique EID
       prefix.

   2.  The EID Prefix registration information, as specified in
       Section 6, MUST be collected upon initial registration and
       renewal, and made publicly available through interfaces allowing
       both retrieval of specific registration details (search) and
       enumeration of the entire registry contents (e.g., [RFC7481],
       WHOIS, HTTP, or similar access methods).

   3.  The registry operator MUST permit the delegation of EID prefixes
       in the reverse DNS space to holders of registered EID prefixes.

   4.  Anyone can obtain an entry in the EID prefix registry, on the
       understanding that the prefix so registered is for the exclusive
       use in the LISP experimental network, and that their registration
       details (as specified in Section 6) are openly published in the

Internet-Draft          LISP EID Block Management             April 2016


       EID prefix registry.


6.  EID Prefix Request Template

   The following is a basic request template for prefix registration so
   to ensure a uniform process.  Such a template is inspired by the IANA
   Private Enterprise Number online request form
   (http://pen.iana.org/pen/PenApplication.page).

   Note that all details in this registration become part of the
   registry and will be published in the LISP EID Prefix Registry.

   The EID Prefix Request template MUST at minimum contain:

   1.  Organization (In the case of individuals requesting an EID prefix
       this section can be left empty)

       (a)  Organization Name

       (b)  Organization Address

       (c)  Organization Phone

       (d)  Organization WebSite

   2.  Contact Person (Mandatory)

       (a)  Name

       (b)  Address

       (c)  Phone

       (d)  Fax (optional)

       (e)  Email

   3.  EID Prefix Request (Mandatory)

       (a)  Prefix Size

            +  Expressed as an address prefix length.

Internet-Draft          LISP EID Block Management             April 2016


       (b)  Prefix Size Rationale

       (c)  Lease Period

            +  Note Well: All EID Prefix registrations will be valid
               until the earlier date of 12 months from the date of
               registration or MMMM/YYYY3.

            +  All registrations may be renewed by the applicant for
               further 12 month periods, ending on MMMM/YYYY3.

            +  According to the 3+3 year experimentation plan, defined
               in [I-D.ietf-lisp-eid-block], all registrations MUST end
               by MMMM/YYYY3, unless the IETF community decides to grant
               a permanent LISP EID address block.  In the latter case,
               registrations following the present document policy MUST
               end by MMMM/YYYY6 and a new policy (to be decided - see
               Section 7) will apply afterwards.

   4.  Experiment Description

       (a)  Experiment and Deployment Description

       (b)  Interoperability with existing LISP deployments

       (c)  Interoperability with Legacy Internet

   5.  Reverse DNS Servers (Optional)

       (a)  Name server name:

       (b)  Name server address:

       (c)  Name server name:

       (d)  Name server address:

       (Repeat if necessary)


7.  Policy Validity Period

   Policy outlined in the present document is tied to the existence of
   the experimental LISP EID block requested in
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-eid-block] and valid until MMMM/YYYY3.

   If the IETF decides to transform the block in a permanent allocation,
   the LISP EID block reserved usage period will be extended for three



Iannone, et al.          Expires October 8, 2016                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft          LISP EID Block Management             April 2016


   years (until MMMM/YYYY6) so as to give time to the IETF to define,
   following the policies outlined in [RFC5226], the final size of the
   EID block and create a transition plan, while the policy in the
   present document will still apply.

   Note that, as stated in [I-D.ietf-lisp-eid-block], the transition of
   the EID block into a permanent allocation has the potential to pose
   policy issues (as recognized in [RFC2860], section 4.3) and hence
   discussion with the IANA, the RIR communities, and the IETF community
   will be necessary to determine appropriate policy for permanent EID
   prefix management, which will be effective after MMMM/YYYY6.

   [RFC Editor: please replace MMMM and all its occurrences in the
   document with the month of publication of [I-D.ietf-lisp-eid-block]
   as RFC.]

   [RFC Editor: please replace YYYY0 and all its occurrences in the
   document with the year of publication of [I-D.ietf-lisp-eid-block] as
   RFC.]

   [RFC Editor: please replace YYYY3 and all its occurrences in the
   document with the year of publication of [I-D.ietf-lisp-eid-block] as
   RFC plus 3 years, e.g., if published in 2016 then put 2019.]

   [RFC Editor: please replace YYYY6 and all its occurrences in the
   document with the year of publication of [I-D.ietf-lisp-eid-block] as
   RFC plus 6 years, e.g., if published in 2016 then put 2022.]


8.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce new security threats in the LISP
   architecture nor in the Legacy Internet architecture.

   For accountability reasons and in line with the security
   considerations in [RFC7020], each registration request MUST contain
   accurate information on the requesting entity (company, institution,
   individual, etc.) and valid and accurate contact information of a
   referral person (see Section 6).


9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA allocated the following IPv6 address block for experimental use
   as LISP EID prefix [I-D.ietf-lisp-eid-block]:






Iannone, et al.          Expires October 8, 2016                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          LISP EID Block Management             April 2016


   o  Address Block: 2001:5::/32

   o  Name: EID Space for LISP

   o  RFC: [I-D.ietf-lisp-eid-block]

   o  Further Details at: http://www.iana.org/assignments/
      iana-ipv6-special-registry/iana-ipv6-special-registry.xhtml

   In order to grant requesting organisations and individuals exclusive
   use of EID prefixes out of such reserved block (limited to the
   duration of the LISP experiment as outlined in Section 7) there is an
   operational requirement for an EID registration service.

   Provided that the policies and requirements outlined in Section 4,
   Section 5, and Section 6 are respected, EID prefix registration is
   accorded based on a "First Come First Served" basis.

   There is no hard limit in the number of registrations an organization
   or individual can submit as long as information described in
   Section 6 is provided, in particular point 4: "Experiment
   Description".

   For the duration defined in [I-D.ietf-lisp-eid-block] RIPE NCC will
   manage the the LISP EID prefix as described herein.  Therefore, this
   document has no IANA actions.


10.  Procedures to be followed by RIPE NCC

   RIPE NCC will provide the registration service following the EID
   Prefix Registration Policy (Section 4) and the EID Prefix
   Registration Requirements (Section 5) provided in this document.  The
   request form provided by RIPE NCC will include at least the
   information from the template in Section 6.  RIPE NCC will make
   publicly available all received requests.  While this document does
   not suggests any minimum allocation size, RIPE NCC is allowed to
   introduce such minimum size for management purposes.

Internet-Draft          LISP EID Block Management             April 2016


   o  Removed "Definition of Terms" section as suggested by Peter Yee in
      the Gen-Art review.

   o  Section "IANA Considerations" has been re-written to fix issue
      raised by IESG, IANA, and P. Yee.

   o  Deleted bullet allowing multiple operators in the requirements
      section.  Due to the limited duration of the experiment one single
      registration operator (RIPE) is sufficient.

   o  Modified the dates, introducing variables, so to allow RFC Editor
      to easily update dates by publication as RFC.

   Version 06 Posted August 2015.

   o  Fixed Authors addresses and typo in section 10.

   Version 05 Posted July 2015.

   o  Added explicit text about RIPE NCC providing the registration
      service during the temporary experiment.

   Version 04 Posted December 2014.

   o  Added two clarification sentences to address the comments of E.
      Lear and D. Saucez during WG LC.

   Version 03 Posted October 2014.

   o  Re-worded the document so to avoid confusion on "allocation" and
      "assignement".  The document now reffers to "registration".  As
      for comments by G. Huston and M. Binderberger.

   Version 02 Posted July 2014.

   o  Deleted the trailing paragraph of Section 4, as for discussion in
      the mailing list.

   o  Deleted the fees policy as of suggestion of G. Huston and
      discussion during 89th IETF.

   o  Re-phrased the availability of the registration information
      requirement avoiding putting specific numbers (previously
      requiring 99% up time), as of suggestion of G. Huston and
      discussion during 89th IETF.

   Version 01 Posted February 2014.

   o  Dropped the reverse DNS requirement as for discussion during the
      88th IETF meeting.

   o  Dropped the minimum allocation requirement as for discussion
      during the 88th IETF meeting.

   o  Changed Section 7 from "General Consideration" to "Policy Validity
      Period", according to J. Curran feedback.  The purpose of the
      section is just to clearly state the period during which the
      policy applies.

   Version 00 Posted December 2013.

   o  Rename of draft-iannone-lisp-eid-block-mgmnt-03.txt.
