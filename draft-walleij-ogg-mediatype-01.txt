Abstract

   The Ogg Bitstream Format aim at becoming a general patent-free
   standard for transporting multimedia content across computing
   platforms and networks.  The intention of this document is to define
   the media type application/ogg to refer to this kind of content when
   transported across the Internet.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].

1. The Ogg Bitstream Format

   The Ogg Bitstream format has been developed as a part of a larger
   project aimed at creating a set of compenents for the coding and
   decoding of multimedia content (codecs) which are to be freely 
   available and freely re-implementable both in software and in
   hardware for the computing community at large, including the 
   Internet community.
   
   Raw packets from these codecs may be used directly by transport
   mechanisms that provide their own framing and packet-seperation
   mechanisms (such as UDP datagrams).

   For stream based storage (such as files) and transport (such as TCP
   streams or pipes), Ogg codecs use the Ogg Bitstream Format to
   provide framing/sync, sync recapture after error, landmarks during
   seeking, and enough information to properly seperate data back into
   packets at the original packet boundaries without relying on decoding
   to find packet boundaries. The application/ogg MIME type refers to
   this kind of bitstreams, when no further knowledge of the bitstream
   content exists.

   The bitstream format in itself is documented in [1].

2. Registration Information

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type application/ogg

   MIME media type name: application

   MIME subtype name: ogg

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: none

   Encoding Considerations:

   The Ogg bitstream format is binary data, and must be encoded for non-
   binary transport; the Base64 encoding is suitable for Email, Binary
   encoding could also be used.

   Security Considerations:

   As the Ogg bitstream file is a container format and only a carrier of
   content (such as Vorbis audio) with a very rigid definition (see
   [1]), this format in itself is not more vulnerable than any other
   content framing mechanism.  The main security consideration for the
   receiving application is to ensure that manipulated packages can not
   cause buffer overflows and the like.  It is possible to encapsulate
   even execuatble content in the bitstream, so for such uses additional
   security considerations must be taken.

   Ogg bitstream files are not signed or encrypted using any applicable
   encryption schemes.  External security mechanisms must be added if
   content confidentiality and authenticity is to be achieved.

   Interoperability considerations:

   The Ogg bitstream format has proved to be widely implementable across
   different computing platforms.  A broadly portable reference
   implementation is available under a BSD license.

   The Ogg bitstream format is not patented and can be implemented by
   third parties without patent considerations.

   Published specification:

   See [1].

Internet-Draft       The application/ogg Media Type             May 2001


   Applications which use this media type:

   Any application that implements the specification will be able to
   encode or decode Ogg bitstream files.  Specifically, the format is
   supposed to be used by  codecs that implement for example Vorbis
   audio.

   Additional information:

   Magic number(s):

   In Ogg bitstream files, the first four bytes are 0x4f 0x67 0x67 0x53
   corresponding to the string "OggS".

   File extension: .ogg

   Macintosh File Type Code(s): OggS

   Object Identifier(s) or OID(s): none

   Person & email address to contact for further information:

   Questions about this proposal should be directed to Linus Walleij
   <triad@df.lth.se>.  Technical questions about the Ogg bitstream
   standard may be asked on the mailing lists for the developer
   community.  <http://www.xiph.org/archives/>

Intended usage: COMMON

   Author/Change controller:

   This document was written by Linus Walleij <triad@df.lth.se>, changes
   of this document will be handled by him or a representative of the
   Xiphophorus company or the associated development communities.

   The Ogg bitstream format is controlled by the Xiphophorus company and
   the respective development communities.
