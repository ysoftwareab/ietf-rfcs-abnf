Internet-Draft      Scenarios and Reqs for IP in ITS           July 2012


1.  Introduction

   The field of vehicular communications is encompassing a large number
   of wired and wireless technologies.  In particular, the breakthrough
   advancements in wide-area cellular telecommunications, the advent of
   inexpensive hardware, impressively high bandwidth and low-cost data
   subscription plans make possible new paradigms which put the vehicle
   at the center of a communications ecosystem.  It can be observed that
   whereas only in the recent past linking vehicles in a robust manner
   to a fixed infrastructure represented endeavors available only to top
   categories, more and more middle category vehicles are announced to
   take advantage of data connectivity.

   Communication protocols used in the fixed and mobile (terminal)
   Internet can be applied in the scenarios employing vehicles which
   communicate.  A number of particular aspects make vehicular
   communications different, not least being the that mobility is the
   norm, rather than the exception.  At the same time, several protocols
   developped at IETF are good candidates to form basis of further
   development of IP protocols for vehicular communications.

   The use of Internet protocols in the vehicular scenarios may prove
   advantageous from several standpoints:

   o  immediate availability of a large number of applications with an
      established customer base.

   o  scalability: large numbers of inter-communicating vehicles can be
      accommodated across large distances.

   o  accessing heterogeneous, mixed and multiple-standard link layer
      technologies.

   The context of vehicular communications considers the use of several
   classes of Internet protocols for vehicular applications.  One
   particular family of protocols is Mobile IP.  Its salient features
   characterize well several mobility aspects such as reachability at
   permanent addresses, seamless handovers and group mobility
   management.  Earlier documents at IETF idenfitied a number of
   scenarios and potential requirements for further work towards
   improving the Mobile IP protocols for a better adaptation in
   vehicular environments (see for example the draft titled "Automotive
   Industry Requirements for NEMO Route Optimization" edited in 2009
   [I-D.ietf-mext-nemo-ro-automotive-req].)

   A Vehicle-to-Infrastructure scenario (V2I) is a typical setting in
   which a vehicle uses a long-range wireless interface (cellular,
   sattelite) to connect to a fixed infrastructure.  As a separate

   matter, scenarios of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications consider
   direct communications between vehicles, without, or with minimal,
   assistance from the infrastructure.  In areas where wireless coverage
   is absent, Vehicle-to-Vehicle-to-Infrastructure communications are
   scenarios where covered vehicles offer access to non covered
   vehicles, in a multi-hop manner.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Scenarios

3.1.  Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I)

   This section describes the communication scenario in which one mobile
   vehicle connects to a fixed infrastructure.

   Topology:
