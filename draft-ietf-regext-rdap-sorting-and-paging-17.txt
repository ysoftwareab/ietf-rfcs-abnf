  Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) Query Parameters for Result
                           Sorting and Paging
              draft-ietf-regext-rdap-sorting-and-paging-17

Abstract

   The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) does not include core
   functionality for clients to provide sorting and paging parameters
   for control of large result sets.  This omission can lead to
   unpredictable server processing of queries and client processing of
   responses.  This unpredictability can be greatly reduced if clients
   can provide servers with their preferences for managing large
   responses.  This document describes RDAP query extensions that allow
   clients to specify their preferences for sorting and paging result
   sets.

1.  Introduction

   The availability of functionality for result sorting and paging
   provides benefits to both clients and servers in the implementation
   of RESTful services [REST].  These benefits include:

   o  reducing the server response bandwidth requirements;
   o  improving server response time;
   o  improving query precision and, consequently, obtaining more
      reliable results;
   o  decreasing server query processing load;
   o  reducing client response processing time.

   Approaches to implementing features for result sorting and paging can
   be grouped into two main categories:

   1.  sorting and paging are implemented through the introduction of
       additional parameters in the query string (e.g.  ODATA protocol
       [OData-Part1]);

   2.  information related to the number of results and the specific
       portion of the result set to be returned, in addition to a set of
       ready-made links for the result set scrolling, are inserted in
       the HTTP header of the request/response.

   However, there are some drawbacks associated with the use of the HTTP
   header.  First, the header properties cannot be set directly from a
   web browser.  Moreover, in an HTTP session, the information on the
   status (i.e. the session identifier) is usually inserted in the
   header or a cookie, while the information on the resource
   identification or the search type is included in the query string.
   The second approach is therefore not compliant with the HTTP standard
   [RFC7230].  As a result, this document describes a specification
   based on the use of query parameters.

   Currently, the RDAP protocol [RFC7482] defines two query types:

   o  lookup: the server returns only one object;
   o  search: the server returns a collection of objects.

   While the lookup query does not raise issues regarding response size
   management, the search query can potentially generate a large result
   set that is often truncated according to server limits.  Besides, it
   is not possible to obtain the total number of objects found that
   might be returned in a search query response [RFC7483].  Lastly,
   there is no way to specify sort criteria to return the most relevant
   objects at the beginning of the result set.  Therefore, the client
   might traverse the whole result set to find the relevant objects or,
   due to truncation, might not find them at all.

   The specification described in this document extends RDAP query
   capabilities to enable result sorting and paging, by adding new query
   parameters that can be applied to RDAP search path segments.  The

   service is implemented using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
   [RFC7230] and the conventions described in [RFC7480].

   The implementation of the new parameters is technically feasible, as
   operators for counting, sorting and paging rows are currently
   supported by the major relational database management systems.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  RDAP Query Parameter Specification

   The new query parameters are OPTIONAL extensions of path segments
   defined in [RFC7482].  They are as follows:

   o  "count": a boolean value that allows a client to request the
      return of the total number of objects found;

   o  "sort": a string value that allows a client to request a specific
      sort order for the result set;

   o  "cursor": a string value representing a pointer to a specific
      fixed size portion of the result set.

   Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] is used in the following
   sections to describe the formal syntax of these new parameters.

2.1.  Sorting and Paging Metadata

   According to most advanced principles in REST design, collectively
   known as HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)
   [HATEOAS], a client entering a REST application through an initial
   URI should use server-provided links to dynamically discover
   available actions and access the resources it needs.  In this way,
   the client is not required to have prior knowledge of the service
   and, consequently, to hard code the URIs of different resources.
   This allows the server to make URI changes as the API evolves without
   breaking clients.  Definitively, a REST service should be as self-
   descriptive as possible.

   Therefore, servers implementing the query parameters described in
   this specification SHOULD provide additional information in their
   responses about both the available sorting criteria and possible

   pagination.  Such information is collected in two OPTIONAL response
   elements named "sorting_metadata" and "paging_metadata".

   The "sorting_metadata" element contains the following properties:

   o  "currentSort": "String" (OPTIONAL) either the value of sort
      "parameter" as specified in the query string or the sort applied
      by default, if any;

   o  "availableSorts": "AvailableSort[]" (OPTIONAL) an array of
      objects, with each element describing an available sort criterion.
      The AvailableSort object includes the following members:

      *  "property": "String" (REQUIRED) the name that can be used by
         the client to request the sort criterion;
      *  "default": "Boolean" (REQUIRED) whether the sort criterion is
         applied by default.  An RDAP server MUST define only one
         default sorting property for each object class;
      *  "jsonPath": "String" (OPTIONAL) the JSONPath of the RDAP field
         corresponding to the property;
      *  "links": "Link[]" (OPTIONAL) an array of links as described in
         [RFC8288] containing the query string that applies the sort
         criterion.

   At least one of the "currentSort" and "availableSorts" properties
   MUST be present.

   The "paging_metadata" element contains the following fields:

   o  "totalCount": "Numeric" (OPTIONAL) a numeric value representing
      the total number of objects found.  It MUST be provided if and
      only if the query string contains the "count" parameter;

   o  "pageSize": "Numeric" (OPTIONAL) a numeric value representing the
      number of objects returned in the current page.  It MUST be
      provided if and only if the total number of objects exceeds the
      page size.  This property is redundant for RDAP clients because
      the page size can be derived from the length of the search results
      array but, it can be helpful if the end user interacts with the
      server through a web browser;

   o  "pageNumber": "Numeric" (OPTIONAL) a numeric value representing
      the number of the current page in the result set.  It MUST be
      provided if and only if the total number of objects found exceeds
      the page size;

   o  "links": "Link[]" (OPTIONAL) an array of links as described in
      [RFC8288] containing the reference to the next page.  In this

      specification, only forward pagination is described because it is
      all that is necessary to traverse the result set.

2.1.1.  RDAP Conformance

   Servers returning the "paging_metadata" element in their response
   MUST include the string literal "paging" in the rdapConformance
   array.  Servers returning the "sorting_metadata" element MUST include
   the string literal "sorting".

2.2.  "count" Parameter

   Currently, the RDAP protocol does not allow a client to determine the
   total number of the results in a query response when the result set
   is truncated.  This is inefficient because the user cannot determine
   if the result set is complete.

   The "count" parameter provides additional functionality (Figure 1)
   that allows a client to request information from the server that
   specifies the total number of objects matching the search pattern.


   https://example.com/rdap/domains?name=*nr.com&count=true

      Figure 1: Example of RDAP query reporting the "count" parameter

   The ABNF syntax is the following:

      count = "count=" ( trueValue / falseValue )
      trueValue = ("true" / "yes" / "1")
      falseValue = ("false" / "no" / "0")

   A trueValue means that the server MUST provide the total number of
   the objects in the "totalCount" field of the "paging_metadata"
   element (Figure 2).  A falseValue means that the server MUST NOT
   provide this number.

     ]
   }

     Figure 2: Example of RDAP response with "paging_metadata" element
                     containing the "totalCount" field

2.3.  "sort" Parameter

   The RDAP protocol does not provide any capability to specify the
   result set sort criteria.  A server could implement a default sorting
   scheme according to the object class, but this feature is not
   mandatory and might not meet user requirements.  Sorting can be
   addressed by the client, but this solution is rather inefficient.
   Sorting features provided by the RDAP server could help avoid
   truncation of relevant results.

   The "sort" parameter allows the client to ask the server to sort the
   results according to the values of one or more properties and
   according to the sort direction of each property.  The ABNF syntax is
   the following:

      sort = "sort=" sortItem *( "," sortItem )
      sortItem = property-ref [":" ( "a" / "d" ) ]
      property-ref = ALPHA *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "_" )

   "a" means that an ascending sort MUST be applied, "d" means that a
   descending sort MUST be applied.  If the sort direction is absent, an
   ascending sort MUST be applied (Figure 3).

   Except for sorting IP addresses, servers MUST implement sorting
   according to the JSON value type of the RDAP field the sorting
   property refers to.  That is, JSON strings MUST be sorted
   lexicographically and JSON numbers MUST be sorted numerically.  If IP
   addresses are represented as JSON strings, they MUST be sorted based
   on their numeric conversion.

   The conversion of an IPv4 address to a number is possible since each
   dotted format IPv4 address is a representation of a number written in
   a 256-based manner: 192.168.0.1 means 1*256^0 + 0*256^1 + 168*256^2 +
   192*256^3 = 3232235521.  Similarly, an IPv6 address can be converted
   into a number by applying the base 65536.  Therefore, the numerical
   representation of the IPv6 address
   2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 is
   42540766452641154071740215577757643572.  Builtin functions and
   libraries for converting IP addresses into numbers are available in
   most known programming languages and relational database management
   systems.

   If the "sort" parameter reports an allowed sorting property, it MUST
   be provided in the "currentSort" field of the "sorting_metadata"
   element.

2.3.1.  Sorting Properties Declaration

   In the "sort" parameter ABNF syntax, property-ref represents a
   reference to a property of an RDAP object.  Such a reference could be
   expressed by using a JSONPath.  The JSONPath in a JSON document
   [RFC8259] is equivalent to the XPath [W3C.CR-xpath-31-20161213] in a
   XML document.  For example, the JSONPath to select the value of the
   ASCII name inside an RDAP domain object is "$.ldhName", where $
   identifies the root of the document object model (DOM).  Another way
   to select a value inside a JSON document is the JSON Pointer
   [RFC6901].  While JSONPath or JSON Pointer are both standard ways to
   select any value inside JSON data, neither is particularly easy to
   use (e.g. "$.events[?(@.eventAction='registration')].eventDate" is
   the JSONPath expression of the registration date in an RDAP domain
   object).

   Therefore, this specification defines property-ref in terms of RDAP
   properties.  However, not all the RDAP properties are suitable to be
   used in sort criteria, such as:

   o  properties providing service information (e.g. links, notices,
      remarks);

   o  multivalued properties (e.g. status, roles, variants);

Internet-Draft           RDAP Sorting and Paging          September 2020


   o  properties representing relationships to other objects (e.g.
      entities).

   On the contrary, properties expressed as values of other properties
   (e.g. registration date) could be used in such a context.  The list
   of properties an RDAP server MAY implement are divided into two
   groups: object common properties and object specific properties.

   o  Object common properties.  Object common properties are derived
      from merging the "eventAction" and the "eventDate" properties.
      The following values of the "sort" parameter are defined:

      *  registrationDate
      *  reregistrationDate
      *  lastChangedDate
      *  expirationDate
      *  deletionDate
      *  reinstantiationDate
      *  transferDate
      *  lockedDate
      *  unlockedDate

   o  Note that some of the object specific properties are also defined
      as query paths.  The object specific properties include:

      *  Domain: name
      *  Nameserver: name, ipV4, ipV6.
      *  Entity: fn, handle, org, email, voice, country, cc, city.

   The correspondence between these sorting properties and the RDAP
   object classes is shown in Table 1:

                  Table 1: Sorting properties definition

   Regarding the definitions in Table 1, some further considerations are
   needed to disambiguate some cases:

   o  Since the response to a search on either domains or nameservers
      might include both A-labels and U-labels [RFC5890] in general, a
      consistent sorting policy MUST treat the unicodeName and ldhName
      as two representations of the same value.  By default, the
      unicodeName value MUST be used while sorting.  When the
      unicodeName is unavailable, the value of the ldhName MUST be used
      instead;

   o  The jCard "sort-as" parameter MUST be ignored for the sorting
      capability described in this document;

   o  Even if a nameserver can have multiple IPv4 and IPv6 addresses,
      the most common configuration includes one address for each IP

      version.  Therefore, the assumption of having a single IPv4 and/or
      IPv6 value for a nameserver cannot be considered too stringent.
      When more than one address per IP version is reported, sorting
      MUST be applied to the first value;

   o  Multiple events with a given action on an object might be
      returned.  If this occurs, sorting MUST be applied to the most
      recent event;

   o  Except for handle values, all the sorting properties defined for
      entity objects can be multivalued according to the definition of
      vCard as given in [RFC6350].  When more than one value is
      reported, sorting MUST be applied to the preferred value
      identified by the parameter pref="1".  If the pref parameter is
      missing, sorting MUST be applied to the first value.

   The "jsonPath" field in the "sorting_metadata" element is used to
   clarify the RDAP field the sorting property refers to.  The mapping
   between the sorting properties and the JSONPaths of the RDAP fields
   is shown below:

   Additional notes on the reported JSONPaths:

   o  those related to the event dates are defined only for the "domain"
      object.  To obtain the equivalent JSONPaths for "entity" and
      "nameserver", the path segment "domainSearchResults" must be
      replaced with "entitySearchResults" and "nameserverSearchResults"
      respectively;

   o  those related to vCard elements are specified without taking into
      account the "pref" parameter.  Servers that sort those values
      identified by the pref parameter SHOULD update a JSONPath by
      adding an appropriate filter.  For example, if the email values
      identified by pref="1" are considered for sorting, the JSONPath of
      the "email" sorting property should be:

   alternate view of the results.

   The "value", "rel" and "href" JSON values MUST be specified.  All
   other JSON values are OPTIONAL.

2.4.  "cursor" Parameter

   The cursor parameter defined in this specification can be used to
   encode information about any pagination method.  For example, in the
   case of a simple implementation of the cursor parameter to represent
   offset pagination information, the cursor value
   "b2Zmc2V0PTEwMCxsaW1pdD01MAo=" is the Base64 encoding of
   "offset=100,limit=50".  Likewise, in a simple implementation to
   represent keyset pagination information, the cursor value
   "a2V5PXRoZWxhc3Rkb21haW5vZnRoZXBhZ2UuY29t=" represents the Base64
   encoding of "key=thelastdomainofthepage.com" whereby the key value
   identifies the last row of the current page.

   This solution lets RDAP providers implement a pagination method
   according to their needs, a user's access level, and the submitted
   query.  Besides, servers can change the method over time without
   announcing anything to clients.  The considerations that have led to
   this solution are reported in more detail in Appendix B.

   The ABNF syntax of the cursor parameter is the following:

      cursor = "cursor=" 1*( ALPHA / DIGIT / "/" / "=" / "-" / "_" )


   https://example.com/rdap/domains?name=*nr.com
   &cursor=wJlCDLIl6KTWypN7T6vc6nWEmEYe99Hjf1XY1xmqV-M=

       Figure 5: An example of an RDAP query reporting the "cursor"
                                 parameter

2.4.1.  Representing Paging Links

   An RDAP server SHOULD use the "links" array of the "paging_metadata"
   element to provide a ready-made reference [RFC8288] to the next page
   of the result set (Figure 6).  Examples of additional "rel" values a
   server MAY implement are "first", "last", and "prev".

3.  Negative Answers

   The value constraints for the parameters are defined by their ABNF
   syntax.  Therefore, each request that includes an invalid value for a
   parameter SHOULD produce an HTTP 400 (Bad Request) response code.
   The same response SHOULD be returned in the following cases:

   o  If in both single and multi sort the client provides an
      unsupported value for the "sort" parameter, as well as a value
      related to an object property not included in the response;

Internet-Draft           RDAP Sorting and Paging          September 2020


   o  If the client submits an invalid value for the "cursor" parameter.

   Optionally, the response MAY include additional information regarding
   either the supported sorting properties or the correct cursor values
   in the HTTP entity body (Figure 7).


{
    "errorCode": 400,
    "title": "Domain sorting property 'unknownproperty' is not valid",
    "description": [
        "Supported domain sorting properties are: 'aproperty', 'anotherproperty'."
    ]

}

                 sorting property included in the request

4.  Implementation Considerations

   Implementation of the new parameters is technically feasible, as
   operators for counting, sorting and paging are currently supported by
   the major relational database management systems.  Similar operators
   are completely or partially supported by the most well-known NoSQL
   databases (e.g.  MongoDB, CouchDB, HBase, Cassandra, Hadoop).
   Additional implementation notes are included in Appendix C.

7.  Security Considerations

   Security services for the operations specified in this document are
   described in [RFC7481].

   A search query typically requires more server resources (such as
   memory, CPU cycles, and network bandwidth) when compared to a lookup
   query.  This increases the risk of server resource exhaustion and
   subsequent denial of service.  This risk can be mitigated by either
   restricting search functionality or limiting the rate of search
   requests.  Servers can also reduce their load by truncating the
   results in a response.  However, this last security policy can result
   in a higher inefficiency if the RDAP server does not provide any
   functionality to return the truncated results.

   The new parameters presented in this document provide RDAP operators
   with a way to implement a server that reduces inefficiency risks.
   The "count" parameter gives the client the ability to evaluate the
   completeness of a response.  The "sort" parameter allows the client
   to obtain the most relevant information at the beginning of the
   result set.  This can reduce the number of unnecessary search
   requests.  Finally, the "cursor" parameter enables the user to scroll
   the result set by submitting a sequence of sustainable queries within
   server-acceptable limits.

Appendix A.  JSONPath operators

   A JSONPath expression represents a path to find an element (or a set
   of elements) in a JSON content.

   The base JSONPath specification requires that implementations support
   a set of "basic operators".  These operators are used to access the
   elements of a JSON structure like objects and arrays, and their
   subelements, respectively, object members and array items.  No
   operations are defined for retrieving parent or sibling elements of a
   given element.  The root element is always referred to as $
   regardless of it being an object or array.

   Additionally, the specification permits implementations to support
   arbitrary script expressions.  These can be used to index into an
   object or array, or to filter elements from an array.  While script
   expression behavior is implementation-defined, most implementations
   support the basic relational and logical operators, as well as both
   object member and array item access, sufficiently similar for the
   purpose of this document.  Commonly-supported operators/functions
   divided into "top-level operators" and "filter operators" are
   documented in Table 2 and Table 3 respectively.

Appendix B.  Approaches to Result Pagination

   An RDAP query could return a response with hundreds, even thousands,
   of objects, especially when partial matching is used.  For this
   reason, the cursor parameter addressing result pagination is defined
   to make responses easier to handle.

   Presently, the most popular methods to implement pagination in a REST
   API include offset pagination and keyset pagination.  Neither
   pagination method requires the server to handle the result set in a
   storage area across multiple requests since a new result set is
   generated each time a request is submitted.  Therefore, they are
   preferred to any other method requiring the management of a REST
   session.

   Using limit and offset operators represents the traditionally used
   method to implement result pagination.  Both of them can be used
   individually:

   o  "limit": means that the server MUST return the first N objects of
      the result set;

   o  "offset": means that the server MUST skip the first N objects and
      MUST return objects starting from position N+1.

   When limit and offset are used together, they provide the ability to
   identify a specific portion of the result set.  For example, the pair
   "offset=100,limit=50" returns the first 50 objects starting from
   position 101 of the result set.

Internet-Draft           RDAP Sorting and Paging          September 2020


   Though easy to implement, offset pagination also includes drawbacks:

   o  When offset has a very high value, scrolling the result set could
      take some time;

   o  It always requires fetching all rows before dropping as many rows
      as specified by offset;

   o  It may return inconsistent pages when data are frequently updated
      (i.e. real-time data).

   Keyset pagination [SEEK] adds a query condition that enables the
   selection of the only data not yet returned.  This method has been
   taken as the basis for the implementation of a "cursor" parameter
   [CURSOR] by some REST API providers [CURSOR-API1] [CURSOR-API2].  The
   cursor is an opaque URL-safe string representing a logical pointer to
   the first result of the next page (Figure 5).

   Nevertheless, even keyset pagination can be troublesome:

   o  It needs at least one key field;

   o  It does not allow sorting simply by any field because the sorting
      criterion must contain a key;

   o  It works best with full composite values support by data base
      management systems (i.e. [x,y]>[a,b]), emulation is possible but
      inelegant and less efficient;

   o  It does not allow direct navigation to arbitrary pages because the
      result set must be scrolled in sequential order starting from the
      initial page;

   o  Implementing bi-directional navigation is tedious because all
      comparison and sort operations have to be reversed.

B.1.  Specific Issues Raised by RDAP

   Furthermore, in the RDAP context, some additional considerations can
   be made:

   o  An RDAP object is a conceptual aggregation of information
      generally collected from more than one data structure (e.g. table)
      and this makes it even harder to implement keyset pagination, a
      task that is already quite difficult.  For example, the entity
      object can include information from different data structures
      (registrars, registrants, contacts, resellers), each one with its
      key field mapping the RDAP entity handle;



Loffredo, et al.         Expires March 22, 2021                [Page 25]

Internet-Draft           RDAP Sorting and Paging          September 2020


   o  Depending on the number of page results as well as the number and
      the complexity of the properties of each RDAP object in the
      response, the time required by offset pagination to skip the
      previous pages could be much faster than the processing time
      needed to build the current page.  In fact, RDAP objects are
      usually formed by information belonging to multiple data
      structures and containing multivalued properties (i.e. arrays)
      and, therefore, data selection might therefore be a time consuming
      process.  This situation occurs even though the selection is
      supported by indexes;

   o  Depending on the access levels defined by each RDAP operator, the
      increase in complexity and the decrease in flexibility of keyset
      pagination in comparison to offset pagination could be considered
      impractical.

   Ultimately, both pagination methods have benefits and drawbacks.

Appendix C.  Additional Implementation Notes

   This section contains an overview of the main choices made during the
   implementation of the capabilities defined above in the RDAP public
   test server of Registro.it at the Institute of Informatics and
   Telematics of the National Research Counci (IIT-CNR).  The content of
   this section can represent a guidance for those implementers who plan
   to provide RDAP users with those capabilities.  The RDAP public test
   server can be accessed at https://rdap.pubtest.nic.it/.  Further
   documentation about the server features is available at
   https://rdap.pubtest.nic.it/doc/README.html.

C.1.  Sorting

   If no sort criterion is specified in the query string, the results
   are sorted by a default property: "name" for domains and nameservers,
   "handle" for entities.  The server supports multiple property sorting
   but the "sorting_metadata" object includes only the links to
   alternative result set views sorted by a single property just to show
   the list of sorting properties allowed for each searchable object.
   The server supports all the object specific sorting properties
   described in the specification except for nameserver sorting based on
   unicodeName, that is, the "name" sorting property is mapped onto the
   "ldhName" response field.  Regarding the object common properties,
   the sorting by registrationDate, expirationDate, lastChangedDate and
   transferDate is supported.

Internet-Draft           RDAP Sorting and Paging          September 2020


C.2.  Counting

   The counting operation is implemented through a separate query.  Some
   relational database management systems support custom operators to
   get the total count together with the rows, but the resulting query
   can be considerably more expensive than that performed without the
   total count.  Therefore, as "totalCount" is an optional response
   information, fetching always the total number of rows has been
   considered an inefficient solution.  Furthermore, to avoid the
   processing of unnecessary queries, when the "count" parameter is
   included in the submitted query, it is not also repeated in the query
   strings of the "links" array provided in both "paging_metadata" and
   "sorting_metadata" objects.

C.3.  Paging

   The server implements the cursor pagination through the keyset
   pagination when sorting by a unique property is requested or the
   default sort is applied, through offset pagination otherwise.  As
   most of the relational database management systems don't support the
   comparison of full composite values natively, the implementation of
   full keyset pagination seem to be troublesome so, at least initially,
   a selective applicability of keyset pagination is advisable.
   Moreover, the "cursor" value encodes not only information about
   pagination but also about the search pattern and the other query
   parameters in order to check the consistency of the entire query
   string.  If the "cursor" value is inconsistent with the rest of the
   query string, the server returns an error response.
