   information field and protocol identifier in the Q.2941 Generic
   Identifier and Q.2957 User-to-user Signaling for the Internet
   protocol.

   The assignment, that is specified in section 4 of this document, is
   designed for advanced B-ISDN signaling support of the Internet
   protocol, especially the B-ISDN signaling support for the connection
   that corresponds to the session in the Internet protocol which is
   clarified in section 2.  This specification provides an indispensable
   framework for the implementation of long-live session and QoS-
   sensitive session transfers over ATM.

0. Background

   In the ITU-T SG11 Geneva meeting held in September 1997, SG11 WP1,
   which has responsibility for the B-ISDN signaling protocol
   recommendation, agreed to establish liaison with the IETF, ATM Forum,
   and other ITU-T Study Groups to provide B-ISDN signaling support for
   the Internet Protocol.

   ITU-T SG11 WP1 is identifying Internet services that can be supported
   by the existing B-ISDN signaling protocol framework, and discussing
   protocol modifications based on this identification.  They planned to
   complete this identification until 3Q 1998.  ITU-T SG11 WP1 will also
   identify Internet services that can be supported by enhancements to
   the current B-ISDN signaling protocol capabilities, and discuss new
   protocol based on this identification.  They planned to complete this
   identification until 1Q 1999.  The issues of B-ISDN support for the
   Internet protocol that are currently recognized by SG11 WP1 are
   described in [16, 17].

   In the ITU-T SG11 WP1 Kochi meeting held in January 1998, WP1 decided
   to discuss B-ISDN signalling support for the Internet protocol based
   on this Internet Draft [18].  In the next ITU-T SG11 Geneva meeting
   that will hold in May 1998, WP1 may decide to enhance the B-ISDN
   signaling protocol based on this draft.  If SG11 WP1 agrees on the
   technical aspects and develop the Awaiting-review text (initial
   draft) in the May 1998 meeting, expected standard development process
   (fastest case) after this meeting is:

   November 1998: Enhance the Awaiting-review text based on inputs and
     develop the Cooling text (Draft Recommendations to be frozen in the
     next meeting, if no significant technical changes are proposed in
     that meeting).

   March 1999: Freeze the Draft Recommendations and letter ballot is
     requested.

   February 2000: The Draft Recommendations are decided (final
     approval).

   To enable advanced B-ISDN signaling support for the Internet protocol
   promptly, liaison from IETF to ITU-T SG11 WP1 is highly appreciated.

   The purpose of this document is to specify the assignment of the
   information field and protocol identifier in the Q.2941 Generic
   Identifier and Q.2957 User-to-user Signaling for the Internet
   protocol.  To enable this specification, section 5 of this document
   clarifies amendments to the current B-ISDN signaling protocol.  ITU-T
   SG11 WP1 will enhance the current B-ISDN signaling protocol based on

   this clarification.

   Note that the assignment rule described in this document may be
   subject to change, so it should not be implemented until ITU-T SG11
   WP1 decides to enhance the B-ISDN signaling protocol based on this
   request.


1. Purpose of Document

   The purpose of this document is to specify the assignment of the
   information field and protocol identifier in the Q.2941 Generic
   Identifier and Q.2957 User-to-user Signaling for the Internet
   protocol.

   The assignment, that is specified in section 4 of this document, is
   designed for advanced B-ISDN signaling support of the Internet
   protocol, especially the B-ISDN signaling support for the connection
   that corresponds to the session in the Internet protocol which is
   clarified in section 2.  Needless to say, the purpose of this
   specification is not limited to this support, and it should also be
   applicable to other purposes.

   This specification provides an indispensable framework for the
   implementation of long-live session and QoS-sensitive session
   transfers over ATM.  Note that this document only specifies the
   assignment of the information field and protocol identifier, and that
   it may not specify complete protocol that enables interoperable
   implementation.  This is because it is beyond the scope of this
   document and will be specified in a separate document.


2. Session-related ATM Connection

   With the development of new multimedia applications on the current
   Internet, the demands for multimedia support are increasing in the IP
   network, which currently supports best effort communications.  In
   particular, demands to support QoS guaranteed communications are
   increasing with the development of voice, audio, and video
   communications applications.  And it may also be necessary to
   introduce the mechanism that can efficiently transfer the huge volume
   of traffic expected with these applications.

   The major features of B-ISDN are high speed, logical multiplexing
   with the VP/VC, and flexible QoS management per VC, so it is quite
   natural to use these distinctive functions of B-ISDN to implement a
   multimedia support mechanism in the IP network.  The flexible QoS
   management and logical multiplexing functions in B-ISDN are the

   expected method of implementing the QoS guaranteed communications in
   the Internet.  And when a long-live session is supported by a
   particular VC, efficient packet forwarding may be possible using the
   high speed and logical multiplexing of B-ISDN.

   This section clarifies B-ISDN signaling functions that are required
   when the session is supported by the VC, for advanced B-ISDN
   signaling support of the Internet protocol.


2.1 Long-live Session Signaling

   An example scenario for establishing a VC for a long-live session is
   shown in Fig. 2.1.

              C. Transfer of the long-live session to a new VC.

   Fig. 2.1: Example scenario for establishing a VC for a long-live session.

   First, a session is multiplexed into the default VC connecting the
   routers.  Then, if a router detects that it is a long-live session,
   it sets up a new VC for the session.  If the new VC is established
   successfully, the long-live session is moved to the new VC.

   In this procedure involving an ATM VC setup, the B-ISDN signaling
   entity in the called side router must detect that the incoming call
   corresponds to a session of the Internet protocol and notify that
   fact to the IP layer entity.  Based on this information, the IP layer
   entity moves the session to the new VC.

INTERNET DRAFT   draft-suzuki-git-uus-assignment-02.txt      March, 1998


   Therefore, to implement this signaling procedure, the B-ISDN
   signaling must include an session identifier as an information
   element.  The B-LLI, B-HLI, User-user, and Generic Identifier
   information elements are all capable of transferring this
   information.  Considering the original purposes of these information
   elements, the most appropriate one to use is the Generic Identifier
   information element.


2.2 QoS-sensitive Session Signaling

   The major difference between QoS-sensitive session signaling and
   long-live session signaling is that call setup is not initiated by
   the detection of a long-live session, but is explicitly initiated by
   the setup protocol such as ST2+ and RSVP.  To implement QoS-sensitive
   session signaling using ATM, the ATM network between the routers must
   forward not only the session identifier but also the setup protocol.

   There are two schemes for forwarding the setup protocol.  One is to
   multiplex the protocol into a default VC connecting the routers, or
   to forward the protocol through a particular VC.  In this case, the
   QoS-sensitive session and the ATM VC are established sequentially.
   The second scheme is to forward the setup protocol as an information
   element in the B-ISDN signaling.  In this case, the QoS-sensitive
   session and the ATM VC are established simultaneously.  The latter
   scheme has the following advantages compared with the former one.

   o Easier to implement.

     - Admission control is simplified, because admission control for
       the IP and ATM layers can be done simultaneously.

     - Watchdog timer processing is simplified, because there is no need
       to watch the IP layer establishment and ATM layer establishment
       sequentially.

   o If the setup protocol supports negotiation, then an ATM VC whose
     QoS is based on the result of negotiation can be established.

   However, the latter scheme, at least, cannot support a case where a
   PVC is used to support a QoS-sensitive session.  Therefore, both
   procedures should be taken into account.

   An example of a message sequence that simultaneously establishes a
   QoS-sensitive session and an ATM VC is shown in Fig. 2.2.

   Fig. 2.2: Example procedure for simultaneous QoS-sensitive session and
             ATM VC establishment.

   Both ST2+ and RSVP are currently proposed for the setup protocol and
   new setup protocols are likely to be developed in the near future.
   Therefore, to generalize the discussion, the procedure for the setup
   protocol in this example is the general connection setup procedure
   using confirmed service.

   To implement this signaling procedure, the B-ISDN signaling must
   include the User-user information element that the capacity is
   sufficient to forward the setup protocol.

3. Overview of the Generic Identifier and User-to-user Signaling

3.1 Overview of the Generic Identifier

   The Generic Identifier enables the transfer of identifiers between
   end-to-end users in the ATM network, and it is defined in the Q.2941
   as an optional information element for the Q.2931 and Q.2971 UNI
   signaling protocol.  The SETUP, ALERTING, CONNECT, RELEASE, RELEASE
   COMPLETE, ADD PARTY, PARTY ALERTING, ADD PARTY ACK, ADD PARTY REJECT,
   DROP PARTY, and DROP PARTY ACK messages that are transferred between
   end-to-end users in the ATM network may contain up to three Generic
   Identifier information elements.  The ATM network transfers the
   Generic Identifier information element transparently if it contains
   no coding rule errors.

   Currently ITU-T SG11 recommends the Q.2941 Part 1 (Q.2941.1) that
   supports the transfer of identifiers for the DSM-CC and H.310.  Note
   that the Generic Identifier for the Internet protocol will be
   recommended in a new part of the Q.2941 (e.g. Q.2941.2 or Q.2941.3).

   The format of the Generic Identifier information element specified in
   the Q.2941.1 is shown in Fig. 3.1.

   The Identifier related standard/application field identifies the
   standard or application that uses the identifier.

   A transferred identifier is given by the combination of the
   Identifier type, length and value fields, and a Generic Identifier
   information element may contain multiple identifiers.

   The Identifier type field is currently specified for the Session or
   Resource.

   The maximum length of the Generic Identifier information element is
   currently 33 octets.

   See the Q.2941.1 for detailed protocol specifications of the Generic
   Identifier.


3.2 Overview of the User-to-user Signaling

   The User-to-user Signaling enables the transfer of information
   between end-to-end users in the ATM network, and it is defined in
   Q.2957 and in Q.2971 annex D as an optional information element for
   the Q.2931 and Q.2971 UNI signaling protocol.  The SETUP, ALERTING,
   CONNECT, RELEASE, RELEASE COMPLETE, PROGRESS, ADD PARTY, PARTY
   ALERTING, ADD PARTY ACK, ADD PARTY REJECT, DROP PARTY, and DROP PARTY
   ACK messages that are transferred between end-to-end users in the ATM
   network may contain a User-user information element.  The ATM network
   transfers the User-user information element transparently if it
   contains no coding rule errors.

   From the viewpoint of B-ISDN signaling applications, it seems the
   Generic Identifier and User-to-user Signaling are similar functions.
   But their rules for processing exceptions are not completely the
   same, because their purposes are different. The Generic Identifier is
   designed for the transfer of identifiers between the c-planes, while
   the User-to-user Signaling is designed for the transfer of user data
   via the c-planes.  Another difference is that the latter supports

   Fig. 4.6: Principle of assignment in the User-user information element.

   The Protocol discriminator field is the Internet protocol/application
   (TBD).  In this case, the first 1 octet in the User information field
   is the Internet protocol/application identifier field.

   Assignment of the Internet protocol/application identifier field is
   as follows.

     0x00: Reserved.

     0x01: MPLS VCID.

     0x02-0xFD: Reserved for IANA assignment (Note).

     0xFE: Experiment/Vendor specific.

     0xFF: Reserved.

   Note: Assignment of the Internet protocol/application identifier
   field for the setup protocol will be specified in a separate
   document.

   The field that follows the Internet protocol/application identifier
   field is assigned to Internet protocol/application related
   information that is identified by the Internet protocol/application
   identifier field.

   If the Experiment/Vendor specific is specified in the Internet
   protocol/application identifier field, the first 3 octets in the
   Internet protocol/application related information field must contain
   the Organizationally unique identifier (OUI).

5. Required Amendments to B-ISDN Signaling

   The information field and protocol identifier assignment in the
   Generic Identifier information element and User-user information
   element, which are described in the previous section, are required
   for advanced B-ISDN signaling support of the Internet protocol.  To
   enable this support, this section clarifies amendments to the B-ISDN
   signaling.


5.1 Required Amendments to the Generic Identifier

   To enable advanced B-ISDN signaling support for the Internet
   protocol, the following amendments should be applied to the Q.2941.1
   Generic Identifier.

   o Add the Internet protocol/application to the Identifier related
     standard/application.

   o Increase the maximum length of the Generic Identifier information
     element to at least 44 octets.


5.2 Required Amendments to the User-to-user Signaling

   To enable advanced B-ISDN signaling support for the Internet
   protocol, the following amendments should be applied to the Q.2957
   and Q.2971 annex D User-to-user Signaling.

   o Add the Internet protocol/application to the Protocol
     discriminator.

   o Desirably, increase the maximum length of the User-user information
     element to sufficiently long, e.g. 262 octets, to forward the setup
     protocol such as ST2+ and RSVP.  This amendment is not applied and
     remains 133 octets when the User-user information element
     interworks with the N-ISDN user-user information element.


6. Security Considerations

   This document specifies the information field and protocol identifier
   assignment in the Q.2941 Generic Identifier and Q.2957 User-to-user
   Signaling for the Internet protocol, so these do not weaken the
   security of the B-ISDN signaling.

   In a called party of the B-ISDN signaling, if the incoming SETUP
   message contains the calling party number and if it is verified and
   passed by the ATM network or it is provided by the network, then it
   is feasible to use the calling party number for part of the calling
   party authentication to strengthen security.
