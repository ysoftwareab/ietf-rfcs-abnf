Abstract 
    
   This document defines the requirements and a proposed solution for 
   an SDP Offer/Answer exchange model for negotiating best-effort SRTP 
   keys, i.e., in a backward-compatible manner with non-SRTP devices.  
   The proposed solution is a trivial interpretation of the usage of 
   the profile and the usage of SDP indication of [sdesc] and [kmgmt].

1. Introduction 
    
   The support of SRTP has been increasing recently, but its adoption 
   has still been relatively slow.  One of the reasons for this is that 
   the currently defined mechanisms for exchanging SRTP keys are based 
   on an all-or-nothing approach, i.e., "Always secure" or "Always not 
   secure".  If the offer indicates SRTP and the answerer cannot 
   support SRTP, or the particular key exchange mechanism, the entire 
   offer, or the actual session invitation, will fail.  When the 
   desired policy is "Always secure", the current established mechanism 
   works perfectly well. 
    
   However, a need has been identified for a third policy: "Best-Effort 
   Security". Best Effort Security means that you prefer that SRTP be 
   used, but you are willing to use RTP if the other end does not 
   support it. There are different reasons why one may wish to use a 
   Best Effort policy. It could be to allow for interoperability with 
   many devices that may not support SRTP. In other cases, it may be as 
   a migration strategy or introducing new equipment that support SRTP, 
   cohabitating with devices that do not support SRTP until the older 
   equipment is replaced.

   Today, there is no generally accepted (and backward compatible) way 
   to indicate Best Effort SRTP key negotiation.  Therefore, an SRTP-
   capable device must either be prepared to re-attempt to establish a 
   media stream with RTP after failing with SRTP, or simply not offer 
   SRTP by default, and upgrade to SRTP when possible.  
    
   With the current mechanism, it may in the best case be possible to 
   start without SRTP initially (i.e., with the AVP [rtp] profile), and 
   then negotiate through another Offer/Answer [RFC3264] with either 
   [kmgmt] or [sdesc] the usage of SRTP and the session keys. This is 
   an extremely cumbersome process, and has the implication that every 
   call will use an additional Offer/Answer exchange, and will also 
   have the consequence that every call will start without SRTP, which 
   is undesirable. 
    
   Also with the current mechanism, starting with SRTP (i.e., the SAVP 
   profile) and downgrading to RTP is only achievable by rejecting the 
   whole session. However, rejecting a session in SIP (normally with a 
   4XX response code), has very negative implications because of the 
   [herfp] issue. To summarize the issue [herfp] means that the 
   rejection sent by the UAS, when used with forking, is very unlikely 
   to reach the UAC. Since that rejection is intended to cause a re-
   negotiation without SRTP, the net effect is that the call fork fails 
   completely. In the best case scenario, another fork may answer 
   (e.g., a voicemail system), and in the worst case scenario, the 
   other forks also fails, which means that the calls fails entirely. 
   This is clearly unacceptable and a great impediment to the 
   deployment of SRTP.  Note that this is an issue for both parallel 
   and sequential forking. 
    
      Note: Some may argue that one may reject the Offer setting the 
      port in the answer to zero as per [RFC3264], and then do a second 
      Offer/Answer; however, since the endpoints that do not support 
      the SAVP profile most likely do not behave this way in the first 
      place (they will reject the whole session), this means it would 
      not be backward compatible to use an Offer rejection mechanism.  
      Furthermore, many UAs automatically generate a BYE if they 
      receive an SDP answer with no accepted media lines 
    
   This document proposes a solution to Best Effort SRTP and backward 
   compatibility problem by introducing a third Policy to the existing 
   ones.  
    
   The existing supported mechanisms as of today are as follows: 
     * SAVP (and associated keys) means secure transport only, i.e. 
     "SRTP only" 
     * AVP means insecure transport only, i.e. "RTP only"

   This drafts proposes a Third mechanism: 
     * AVP with associated SRTP attributes means "Best-Effort SRTP" 
    
    
   The mechanism outlined in this document is trivial, and is defined 
   in order to successfully negotiate multiple mechanisms in one 
   offer/answer exchange, even if the answerer only supports clear/non-
   secure RTP, and it is backward compatible. Examples are given for 
   [kmgmt] and [sdesc].  This mechanism only applies to Offer/Answer-
   based applications. 
    
   The procedures described in this specification represent a technique 
   that has already been used and deployed in the real-world. It has 
   also been briefly mentioned in [sdp-neg], which lists many 
   techniques used today. Of all the techniques described in [sdp-neg], 
   it is by far the simplest one to address the "Best Effort SRTP" 
   problem, and the only one that does not risk "breaking" any 
   implementations.  
    
   It has been argued in [sdp-neg] that using "RTP/AVP" violates 
   [srtp].  After reviewing [srtp], the authors could not find any 
   justification to this claim.  Rather, the authors claim that "if 
   SAVP is indicated, we can infer that SRTP is to be used, but the 
   reverse is not necessarily true, i.e., if AVP is used, it does not 
   mean that SRTP will not be used".  In other words, there is a well-
   defined encoding for using SRTP which is "SAVP", but that does not 
   preclude an offerer from offering "AVP" and proposing SRTP 
   dynamically.  RFC 3407 [sim-cap] essentially already allows such a 
   model, whereby the backward-compatible encoded media profile may be 
   of one type, while the [sim-cap] offered alternate capability may 
   change the profile for those that understand [sim-cap].  This draft 
   essentially employs a similar model, but using the [sdesc] or 
   [kmgmt] attributes as the explicit alternate profile offer.  It 
   should also be noted that [zrtp] already uses AVP for SRTP traffic.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.  The 
   terminology in this document conforms to RFC 2828, "Internet 
   Security Glossary". 
    
    
3. Applicability 
    
   This draft proposes using a [sdesc]/[kmgmt] style key exchange in a 
   backward-compatible manner with legacy RTP devices, for Offer/Answer

   exchange-based applications.  This mechanism should provide a 
   smoother migration path, broader applicability, and more rapid 
   acceptance than [sdesc] or [kmgmt] mechanism used only in the "SRTP 
   only" mode. 
    
   The rules of this specification apply to AVP/SAVP. 
    
   OPEN ISSUE: The same technique arguably could be used with AVPF 
               [RFC4585]/SAVPF[savpf]. Should it? We have assumed only 
               AVP/SAVP, but it could easily be expanded to cover 
               AVPF/SAVPF. 
    
    
4. Requirements 
    
   Unlike the requirements addressed in [sdpng] and [sdp-cap-neg], this 
   mechanism is not trying to address all the general issues with SDP 
   capability negotiation.  Instead, it is trying to provide a solution 
   to a very short and defined set of requirements: 
    
   REQ-1: It MUST be possible to indicate and negotiate RTP vs. SRTP 
   profiles, on a per media stream basis. 
    
   REQ-2: It MUST be possible to offer SRTP profile to an RTP-only 
   answerer, and successfully negotiate RTP, without additional 
   offer/answers. 
    
   REQ-3: It MUST be possible to offer SRTP without allowing a fallback 
   to RTP, if the answerer does not support SRTP but the offerer only 
   wishes to either use SRTP or fail the negotiation. 
    
   REQ-4: The mechanism MUST be backwards compatible for SIP RTP-only 
   devices, without requiring them to change. 
    
   REQ-5: The mechanism MUST be media-type agnostic. (i.e., work with 
   any media type of any codec, etc.) 
    
   REQ-6: The mechanism MUST work in the presence of SIP forking. 
    
   REQ-7: The mechanism SHOULD support RTCP-based feedback, e.g. AVPF. 
   OPEN ISSUE: Should REQ-7 be a requirement? 
 
   We believe the above to be the necessary and sufficient requirements 
   set to achieve broad applicability and deployment of SRTP in the 
   near future.  Below, we provide a proposed solution meeting those 
   requirements.

5. Solution Overview  
    
   The basic concept is: 
    
   If an SRTP-capable device wishes to *only* offer SRTP and will only 
   accept SRTP be used, then it performs exactly the same steps as 
   defined in [sdesc] or [kmgmt], including indicating the SAVP 
   profile.  The answerer would do the same.  This is per current 
   practice. 
    
   If a device wishes to offer RTP only, then it uses the AVP profile, 
   and does not use [sdesc] or [kmgmt].  The answerer does the same.  
   This is also per current practice. 
    
   If an SRTP-capable device wishes to offer SRTP but will accept an 
   RTP answer if the far-end only supports that for a given media 
   stream, then it indicates SRTP support as an alternative, by 
   inserting the same media-level crypto attributes of [sdesc] or key 
   management attributes of [kmgmt], or both, into the offer using non-
   secure transport profiles (e.g., "AVP" instead of "SAVP"). 
    
   A legacy RTP-only device will ignore these unknown attributes and 
   answer as if they did not exist, i.e. using the "AVP" profile 
   without any crypto or key-mgmt attributes.  The offerer then knows 
   they don't support it and will establish the session using regular 
   RTP. 
    
   A device supporting this draft and SRTP understands the attributes 
   indicate a willingness to use the SAVP profile instead, and responds 
   accordingly, by including a crypto or key-mgmt attribute in the 
   answer (but still using "AVP" encoding), resulting in SRTP. 
    
    
     * The main difficulty with offering SRTP-attributes using non-
     secure transport profiles is that SRTP packets are virtually 
     indistinguishable from RTP packets - there is no "SRTP flag".  
     That means the offerer must either wait for the answer before 
     knowing how to handle received RTP packets, or a distinguishing 
     factor must be defined.  This specification assumes the former: 
     the offerer must wait for an answer.  Such is normally the case 
     with SRTP offers today anyway.  Alternative methods for 
     distinguishing early media may be the subject of further study. 
     This specification is forward compatible with any such mechanism, 
     because it is expected that those mechanisms would introduce 
     additional encodings and negotiation procedures (at the SDP level, 
     and/or in-band).

6. Offer/Answer Model:  
    
   This draft is based on the offer/answer method of [RFC3264] as used 
   by [sdesc] and [kmgmt], except the use of secure transport (e.g., 
   "SAVP") type encoding in SDP is not always used, as described above 
   in section 6 and detailed below.  This also changes some of the 
   offer/answer details and RTP processing behavior as described below. 
    
    
6.1. Generating the Initial Offer 
    
   If a device supporting this draft wanted to mandate use of secure 
   transport (i.e., SRTP) for a particular media stream they MUST 
   continue to use the [sdesc] or [kmgmt] prescribed secure transport 
   encoding, i.e. "SAVP", as before.   
    
   A device supporting this draft that wishes to use secure transport 
   if the answerer supports it, but is willing to accept non-secure 
   transport otherwise (i.e., best effort SRTP), offers the same media-
   level crypto attributes and parameters as [sdesc], and/or media-
   level key-mgmt attributes of [kmgmt], except that it will indicate 
   the "RTP/AVP" profile in SDP.  The purpose of this is that, should 
   the receiver(s) of the offer not support SRTP, or not support it for 
   that particular media stream, the offer will not be rejected.  The 
   offerer can still decide to end the session at any time should it 
   wish to.  
    
   An offerer MAY offer both [sdesc] crypto attributes and [kmgmt] key-
   mgmt attributes in the same SDP offer, for the same media sessions.  
   The offerer SHOULD order them in the order it prefers - the first 
   type offered is the most preferred, per media stream.   
    
   A potential complication is that KMGMT allows for supporting either 
   session level key management, media level key management or both. 
   When used with best-effort negotiation and in conjunction with 
   [sdesc], the procedures can get very cumbersome. This specification 
   requires that if Best Effort SRTP is used, that media-level 
   negotiation *only* MUST be offered.  If both session-level and 
   media-level attributes are offered, for example a session-level key-
   mgmt and media-level crypto, the secure transport "SAVP" encoding 
   MUST be used as per [kmgmt] and [sdesc]. 
    
   Once an offer is generated with one or more crypto or key-mgmt 
   attributes using a non-secure transport encoding in SDP, the offerer 
   MUST NOT render any received media for those streams until an SDP 
   answer is received.  This is because the offerer cannot definitively 
   know whether the received media is SRTP or RTP until it receives the 
   answer.  SRTP key exchange already has this property today, for 
   which security pre-conditions as defined in [sec-pre] or provisional

   responses may be used as a solution.  As mentioned in section 5, 
   alternative proposed methods to distinguish between RTP and SRTP 
   media are the subject of further study.  If the offerer can 
   accurately determine how to interpret the received media, then it 
   MAY render it.  
    
   In summary, the offerer encodes a secure transport type (SAVP) for 
   every media stream it demands be secured, while encoding a non-
   secure transport type (AVP) but with the crypto and/or key-mgmt 
   attributes for every media stream it would accept non-secure 
   transport for.   
    
6.2. Generating the Initial Answer 
    
   If the offer contained both crypto and key-mgmt attributes, it is up 
   to answerer's local policy which key mechanism the answerer wishes 
   to use.  The answerer SHOULD accept the first one in the offer it 
   understands and can support, per media stream.  It MUST only encode 
   the like attribute type it chose to use for SRTP per media stream, 
   in the answer.  In other words, it cannot choose both crypto and 
   key-mgmt for the same media stream. 
    
   Regardless of local-policy preference for which particular key type 
   to accept, the answerer MUST accept either one or the other if it 
   can.  In other words, the offerer has indicated it wishes to use 
   SRTP, and the answerer MUST agree to do so if possible. 
    
   As per [sdesc] and [kmgmt], if the answerer chooses to accept crypto 
   attributes or key-mgmt, it MUST use the first attribute in the 
   offered list of attributes per media stream it can support if there 
   are more than one offered attributes for a given key exchange type.  
   For example if two crypto-style keys are offered for a given media 
   stream, the answerer must select the first one it supports. 
    
   If it cannot support any of the offered crypto or key-mgmt 
   attributes, however, it MUST treat the offer as if *no* crypto-
   attributes had been offered.  In other words, if the answerer's 
   policy allows non-secure RTP, it can accept the offer as if it had 
   been so.  If the answerer's local policy is to only allow SRTP media 
   and not accept non-secure RTP, it MAY reject the offer.  This lets a 
   key-mgmt-only offerer successfully negotiate non-secure RTP with a 
   crypto-only answerer, and vice-versa. 
    
   If the offer used a secure transport encoding in SDP, per [sdesc] or 
   [kmgmt], then it MUST operate as in [sdesc] or [kmgmt] and answer 
   using a secure transport encoding syntax if it can for the same 
   media stream, or fail the offer.  Thus an answerer supporting this 
   draft will interoperate with an offerer supporting only legacy 
   [sdesc] or [kmgmt].

   If the offer uses best effort SRTP (using RTP/AVP profile), but 
   offered crypto or key-mgmt attributes which were acceptable and 
   answered, the answerer encodes its chosen key type and values and 
   MUST continue to use the insecure transport encoding, i.e., the 
   RTP/AVP profile.   
    
    
6.3. Processing the Initial Answer 
    
   As per [sdesc] and [kmgmt], the answer is checked for matching 
   crypto or key-mgmt attributes and key information.  If the answer 
   uses the RTP/AVP profile, and no crypto or key-mgmt attribute lines 
   are found in the answer, however, and the originally offered 
   transport was "AVP", then the negotiation MUST NOT be considered to 
   have failed.  Instead, non-secure RTP is used regardless if the 
   original offer included any crypto or key-mgmt attributes to begin 
   with.  This lets a Best-Effort SRTP offerer successfully negotiate 
   with a non-SRTP answerer, and a key-mgmt-only offerer successfully 
   negotiate non-secure RTP with a crypto-only answerer, and vice-
   versa. 
    
   If a crypto attribute line is found in the answer, but does not have 
   a matching tag, included key, or contain all of the mandatory 
   negotiated session parameters, then the session negotiation MUST 
   fail.  If a key-mgmt line is found in the answer, but does not pass 
   key management protocol processing, then the session negotiation 
   MUST fail.  If both a crypto attribute and key-mgmt line is found in 
   the answer, at the media-level for the same media stream, then the 
   session negotiation MUST fail.  If an answer contains a valid crypto 
   or key-mgmt attribute but they were not of the same key exchange 
   type as the offer for that media stream, then the session 
   negotiation MUST fail.  These would all represent protocol failures. 
    
   If a key-mgmt line is found in the answer at the session level and a 
   key-mgmt or crypto attribute at the media level, and such was also 
   offered, then the media-level answers are used for each respective 
   media stream, and the session-level one used for the remaining SAVP 
   media streams (ones without media-level crypto or key-mgmt answers).  
   This is the same as best current practice today. 
    
   For each media stream which an acceptable answer is received at the 
   media level, and for all remaining SAVP media streams if an 
   acceptable session-level answer, the offerer MUST only accept SRTP 
   using the key and other values in the answer.  It would do so as 
   described in [sdesc] or [kmgmt], as if the original Offer and Answer 
   used SAVP secure transport encoding.  The offerer would then begin 
   generating SRTP based on the answer as per [sdesc] or [kmgmt] and

7. Forked Offers and Multiple Answers 
    
   The generated Offer may be forked along the path, resulting in 
   multiple Answers.  It is typically up to local-policy how to handle 
   such situations.   
    
    
8. Clipping and Changing Transport Types 
    
   This draft relies on an Answer before processing media.  Such is the 
   case typically for SRTP today regardless, as the offered keys are 
   usually the transmit keys - so an Answer has to be received to know 
   how to decrypt received SRTP.  NAT traversal using ICE has this 
   limitation as well.  [sdesc] and [mikey-rsa-r] also have this 
   limitation.  Security preconditions, as defined in [sec-pre], and/or 
   sending the SDP answer in provisional responses as soon as possible, 
   are RECOMMENDED for such cases. 
    
   A second issue is changing transport types, in an updated 
   offer/answer.  Since media typically reaches the UAC before an 
   answer, it may be difficult to know when to switch from RTP to SRTP 
   or vice-versa. 
    
   Supporting such cases is for future study. 
    
    
9. Example Offer/Answer Exchange 
 
   In the following example, Alice is proposing to establish an 
   unsecure RTP H.263 video channel in conjunction with a Best Effort 
   SRTP voice channel using either G.711 or G.729, using either [kmgmt] 
   or [sdesc]. Note that the a=crypto and the a=key-mgmt lines are 
   really 2 long lines.

   In this sample Answer below, Bob does not support SRTP, and 
   therefore ignores the [kmgmt] and [sdesc] attributes and selects RTP 
   for the voice channel, and also accepts the video channel.

10.  Security Considerations 
    
   Like [sdesc], SDP using the mechanism in this draft with crypto 
   attributes is conveyed in an encapsulating application protocol 
   which MUST provide both strong eavesdropping and authentication 
   mechanisms.  The same may be true of key-mgmt lines, depending on 
   the key management protocol.  The security requirements in [sdesc] 
   and [kmgmt] MUST be followed for this draft as well.

10.1.     Security Implications vs. [sdesc] and [kmgmt] 
    
   The best-effort mechanism proposed in this draft may be considered 
   less secure than [sdesc] and [kmgmt] because it allows a bid-down 
   attack to establish non-secure RTP sessions, even if both ends 
   supported SRTP.  It is however more secure than not using SRTP at 
   all.  This is by design, however, in order to facilitate 
   interoperability and migration from RTP to SRTP.  No mechanism 
   proposed so far truly can prevent a bid-down attack.  The difference 
   is that [sdesc] and [kmgmt] would result in a failed session 
   negotiation, whereas this mechanism would not.  The authors consider 
   that a benefit of this draft, not a drawback.  This draft still 
   mandates using SAVP if the offerer *only* accepts secure transport.  
   If the offerer would accept less anyway, then a malicious attacker 
   can as easily bid-down [sdesc] or [kmgmt] simply by failing the 
   session, since by definition such an offerer will re-signal using 
   non-secure transport encoding.  Therefore, this draft's mechanism is 
   only more susceptible to bid-down in a trivial way - namely because 
   it will happen in fewer messages.   
    
   Using S/MIME or signing bodies using [identity] may also prevent 
   bid-down attacks.   
    
   Neither party needs to accept a session using non-secure RTP: the 
   offerer can simply use the secure transport encoding in SDP, and the 
   answerer can simply reject offers which do not offer such; or either 
   end can terminate the session or re-offer at any time.  Those are 
   local policy decisions which are available for any mechanism.
