   Premise of secure bootstrapping

   o  Group Owner can connect to Internet with server.

   o  User application has been binded with group owner.

   Func() in step 7 is used to calculate a value based on inputing
   RandomKey and PSK.  and is known by both thing and group owner.  The
   definion is out of this document's scope.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   TBD

6.  Acknowledgements
