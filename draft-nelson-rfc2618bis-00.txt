Internet-Draft    RADIUS Authentication Client MIB (IPv6)  February 2005


1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document uses terminology from RFC 2618 [RFC2618] and RFC 2865
   [RFC2865].

2.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   The objects defined within this memo relate to the RADIUS
   Authentication Client as defined in RFC 2865 [RFC2865].

3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

4.  Scope of Changes

   This document updates RFC 2618 [RFC2618], RADIUS Authentication
   Client MIB, by augmenting the conceptual table rows for
   radiusAuthServerEntry, adding new columns called
   radiusAuthServerInetAddressType, radiusAuthServerInetAddress, and
   radiusAuthClientServerInetPortNumber.  The purpose of these added MIB
   objects is to support IPv6 addressing formats.  The existing table
   columns radiusAuthServerAddress and radiusAuthClientServerPortNumber
   are deprecated but may continue to be used in IPv4-only deployments.

5.  Struture of the MIB Module

   The structure of the MIB Module defined in this memo extends the
   structure of the MIB Module defined in RADIUS Authentication Client
   MIB, RFC 2618 [RFC2618] using the SMI AUGMENTS syntax, but does not
   alter that structure, except to deprecate the corresponding IPv4-only

   address format objects.

6.  Deprecated Objects

   The following objects, defined in RADIUS Authentication Client MIB,
   RFC 2618 [RFC2618] are deprecated:

      radiusAuthClientServerPortNumber

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires IANA assignment of a number in the MIB-2 OID
   number space.

9.  Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX-
   ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this MIB is
   implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder can
   alter or create any management objects of this MIB via direct SNMP
   SET operations.

   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
   sensitive information.  These are:

   radiusAuthServerInetAddress This can be used to determine the address
      of the RADIUS authentication server with which the client is
      communicating.  This information could be useful in mounting an
      attack on the authentication server.

   radiusAuthClientServerInetPortNumber This can be used to determine
      the port number on which the RADIUS authentication client is
      sending.  This information could be useful in impersonating the
      client in order to send data to the authentication server.

   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them
   over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features
   for such a secure environment.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 do not provide a secure environment.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use

Internet-Draft    RADIUS Authentication Client MIB (IPv6)  February 2005


   of the User-based Security Model [RFC2574] and the View-based Access
   Control Model [RFC2575] is recommended.  Using these security
   features, customer/users can give access to the objects only to those
   principals (users) that have legitimate rights to GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
