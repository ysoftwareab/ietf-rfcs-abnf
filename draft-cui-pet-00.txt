 IPv6 offers significant advantages over IPv4, however it will take 
 long time to replace IPv4 with IPv6. Therefore, these two protocols are 
 expected to coexist during the transition period. Currently, there are 
 many transition devices deployed to solve transition problems. Most of 
 them only use one technology (either translation or tunneling). However,
 any transition technology has limitation and application scope. In 
 transition scenarios, besides IP version of source, middle and destination
 network, the network characteristic (a regular edge network or a backbone) 
 has key impact on system performance of transition methods. Therefore, we 
 need to decide which transition method should be used in some typical 
 transition scenarios and how the transition and tunneling devices 
 collaborate for solving transition problems. This draft introduces a smart
 toolbox named PET (shortfor Prefixing, encapsulation and translation) which
 includes all fundamental elements needed in all transition scenarios, such
 as the control and data plane operations of tunneling and translation.
 Based on PET, we propose a network side transition solution. In this framework, 
 there deploys only one kind of transition device, i.e. PET. Through the
 collaboration of PETs, the transition problems can be solved. In this draft, 
 we give the advantages and disadvantages of all transition methods PET may adopt
 according to IP version of source, middle and destination network, and the 
 network characteristic.

1. Introduction

      Recently more and more IPv6 networks have been deployed, especially
   IPv6 backbone networks, while the existing IPv4 networks still carry
   the major network traffic and hold the major network services and
   applications, though facing serious address space problem and other
   problems. It has been agreed that IPv4 and IPv6 networks will co-
   exist for a long term. This leads to the need of IPv4-IPv6 transition
   methods.

      There are many methods for IPv4-IPv6 transition, which can be roughly
   classified into two groups: translation and tunneling. Translation is
   a technology that translates emantic between IPv4 and IPv6. There are 
   many translation methods, such as SIIT [RFC 2765], NAT-PT [RFC 2766], 
   BIS [RFC 2767], SOCKS64 [RFC 3089], BIA [RFC 3338], IVI [draft-ietf-xli
   -behave-ivi-02] and so on. Translation technology can realize IPv4 
   and IPv6 interworking directly, however, it will lead to information 
   loss.

      Tunneling is a technology to encapsulate packets from a different
   protocol within the protocol of the route that delivers it to the 
   target network. There are many tunneling methods, such as IP-in-IP
   tunnel [RFC 2893, RFC 4213], GRE tunnel [RFC 1702], 6to4 tunnel 
   [RFC 2893], 6over4 tunnel [RFC 2529], softwire transition technology 
   [RFC 5565] and so on. Tunneling technology can not realize the IPv4 and
   IPv6 interworking directly. It can only deal with the scenario where
   two IPv4 (IPv6) nodes want to communicate with each other through
   IPv6 (IPv4) network. However, tunneling technology has several
   advantages, besides no information loss, it can be realized
   easily by hardware, and does not introduce routing information
   into a network with different address family.

      Differnt transition methods need differnt transition devices, which 
   may produced by differnt device providers. It is hard for these 
   hetero-devices to collaberate for solving transition probelm. In addition, 
   there exit some transition scenarios where both translation and 
   tunneling technologies are needed. Moreover, in this case, using 
   translation first or tunneling first has important impact on system 
   performance due to their application scope and limitation. In current 
   transition framework, the transition method that the network adopts depends
    on the transition devices the packets met, which cannot take advantage of
   the characteristic  of different transition technologies. Hence, it is 
   necessary to build a mechanism to decide where and when to use tunneling 
   or translation according to IP version of source, middle and destination 
   network, as well as the network characteristic (a regular edge network or
    a backbone).
       
      Aiming to the above probelms, this draft presents an IPv4-IPv6 transition 
   framework, which is a network side transition solution. It introduces a 
   toolbox named PET (short for Prefixing, encapsulation and translation) to 
   solve IPv4-IPv6 transition. PET includes all fundamental elements needed in 
   transition scenarios, which provides the flexibility for network to decide 
   the proper transition methods according to IP version of source, middle and 
   destination network as well as the network characteristic. In addition, the 
   PET-based transition framework makes network only need one kind of transition 
   device, which brings conveniences to consititue the transition policies.
   This draft also addresses how to deploy PETs and analyze the advantages and 
   disadvantages of all transition methods that PET may adopt.

      There are two main IPv4-IPv6 transition scenarios. One is to
   connect several edge networks with the same address family across a
   transit core network with another address family; the other scenario
   is to make hosts with one address family capable of directly 
   communicating with hosts with the other address family. We call the 
   first scenario heterogeneous crossing. The scenario where two IPv4 (IPv6) nodes
   want to communicate with each other through IPv6 (IPv4) network
   belongs to heterogeneous crossing (see figures 1 and 2). We call the
   second scenario heterogeneous direct-connection. The scenario
   where an IPv4 (IPv6) node wants to directly communicate with an IPv6
   (IPv4) node belongs to heterogeneous direct-connection, (see figure 3
   and 4).

      In fact, all IPv4-IPv6 transition scenarios can be viewed as the
   combination of heterogeneous crossing and direct-connection. Hence,
   the fundamental transition elements needed in heterogeneous crossing
   and direct-connection are those needed in all IPv4-IPv6 transition
   scenarios.

      In heterogeneous crossing scenario, tunneling technology can be
   used to transmit IPv4 (IPv6) packets through IPv6 (IPv4) networks. In
   addition, through twice translations, IPv4 (IPv6) packets can also be
   transmitted through IPv6 (IPv4) networks in heterogeneous crossing

   scenario. In heterogeneous direct-connection scenario, when IPv4
   (IPv6) nodes want to communicate with IPv6 (IPv4) nodes directly, it
   can only use translation technology.

       In addition, when adopting tunneling for supporting IPv4/IPv6
   inter-working, some control operations involved with subnet prefix
   should be done beforehand. Theses operations include prefix
   announcement, tunnel endpoint discovery, the selection of tunnel
   endpoint and tunnel belonging to the same tunnel endpoint, tunnel
   configuration, and so on.  Similarly, when adopting translation method
   for supporting IPv4/IPv6 inter-working, some control operations
   involved with subnet prefix also should be done beforehand. These
   operations include the establishment of address mapping mechanism,
   prefix configuration and so on. We call these control operations
   involved with subnet prefix prefixing.

      In conclusion, there are three fundamental elements needed in all
   IPv4-IPv6 transition scenarios, i.e. prefixing, encapsulation and 
   translation.

      To realize a generic solution in network side for IPv4/IPv6
   translation, this draft introduces a toolbox named PET which includes
   the above fundamental elements. Its detailed descriptions are given
   in section 4.


4. Descriptions of PET
      PET is a smart transition toolbox supporting IPv4/IPv6 inter-
   working. It can deal with the heterogeneous crossing and direct-
   connection scenarios. Because all IPv4-IPv6 transition scenarios can
   be viewed as the combination of the heterogeneous crossing and
   direct-connection, the PET-based transition method is a generic
   solution for IPv4/IPv6 transition. PET toolbox has the following
   functions:

      P: representing prefixing. Prefixing includes all transition
   operations of control plane involved with subnet prefix.

      In detail, in tunneling technology, prefixing includes prefix
   announcement, tunnel endpoint discovery, the selection of tunnel
   endpoint and tunnel belonging to the same tunnel endpoint, and so on.
   For example, in softwire transition technology, the IPv6 prefix and
   IPv4 next-hop mapping information should be announced out through
   extended MP-BGP (Multi-protocol BGP) signaling beforehand. Based on
   this prefixing operation, the auto 4over6 tunnels can be established.

Internet-Draft                       PET                     July 2009


      In translation technology, prefixing includes the establishment of
   address mapping mechanism, prefix configuration and so on. For
   example, in IVI-based translation scheme, the global IPv6 prefix
   should be configured in an autonomous domain (AS) beforehand, to form
   the global IVI address, thus realizing the stateless translation.

      E: representing encapsulation. E includes all tunneling operations
   of data plane, such as encapsulation, decapsulation and maximum
   transmission unit (MTU) processing and so on.

      Through this operation, packets from IPv6 (IPv4) network are
   encapsulated on the PET toolbox and sent across IPv4 (IPv6) backbone
   to another IPv6 (IPv4) network according to the mappings stored on
   the PET box.

      T: representing translation. It includes all translation
   operations of data plane, such as address mapping and protocol
   translation, MTU processing.

      Address mapping is to map IPv4 addresses to IPv6 addresses, and
   vice versa. Based on address mapping, packets can be translated from
   one address family to another. IPv4 and IPv6 are not directly
   compatible, so programs and systems designed on one standard can not
   communicate with those designed to the other. Hence we need protocol
   translation. Here, protocol translation includes IP layer translation
   and application layer translation. Through protocol translation, the
   semantic of IP layer and application layer of an IPv4 packet is
   equivalent with that of the translated IPv6 packet and vice versa. In
   addition, to implement translation, PET may collaborate with the
   domain name system (DNS).

      The basic idea of our solution is to deploy several PET toolboxes
   between backbone network and customer networks. The following section
   will discuss how PET deals with different IPv4/IPv6 translation
   scenarios in detail.


5. PET Framework
      PET is an all-in-one solution for IPv4/IPv6 inter-working.
   Basically, PET scheme integrates prefixing, translation and tunneling
   schemes into one solution. Figure 5 shows the overall topology of PET
   framework, which uses PET boxes between IPv6 backbone and IPv4
   customer networks. In this topology, an IPv6 backbone is connected
   with several customer networks including IPv4 backbone, IPv4 virtual
   private networks (VPNs), IPv6 network and dual stack networks.

      For different transition scenarios, PET can provide different
   functionalities to ensure the interworking of IPv4/IPv6 network. We
   will analyze how PET works in all scenarios in the following
   subsections.

5.1. IPv4-IPv6-IPv4

      This is the scenario where an IPv4 network wants to talk with
   another IPv4 network across IPv6 backbone. There are two methods for
   PET to handle this scenario. One is translation and the other is
   tunneling. If PET adopts translation method, we need twice
   translations. In detail, an IPv4 packet need be translated by PET
   into an IPv6 packet for being delivered through IPv6 backbone. When 
   this packet arrives at another PET, it will be translated into an IPv4
   packet again for being delivered through IPv4 network.

      The other method for IPv4-IPv6-IPv4 scenario is tunneling. This
   requires a PET to encapsulate the packets and sent them to the tunnel 
   endpoint PET across IPv6 backbone. When these packets arrive at the 
   tunnel endpoint PET,they are de-capsulated and sent to IPv4 customer 
   networks.

      Because translation method will incur information loss, PET
   prefers to use tunneling technology to handle IPv4-IPv6-IPv4 scenario.
   Its operations are shown in Fig.6.

5.2. IPv4-IPv6-IPv6

      This is the scenario where an IPv4 customer network wants to talk
   with an IPv6 customer network across IPv6 backbone. There are two
   methods to deal with this scenario. One is translation plus
   forwarding. The other is tunneling plus translation.

      In the first method, when an IPv4 packet arrives at PET, it will
   be translated into an IPv6 packet and then sent to the IPv6 network
   through IPv6 backbone. In the second method, when an IPv4 packet
   arrives at PET, it will be encapsulated as an IPv6 packet for being
   delivered through IPv6 backbone. Once this packet arrives at the
   tunnel endpoint PET, it will be decapsulated to the original IPv4

   packet and then be translated as an IPv6 packet to deliver to the
   IPv6 customer network.

       If the IPv4 customer network is not an IPv4 backbone, PET prefers to
   adopt the first method because this complexity of second method is higher 
   than that of the first method. Its operation is shown in Fig.7.

  Figure 7 : PET operations in IPv4-IPv6-IPv6 scenario (IPv4 customer network 
  is not an IPv4 backbone)
     
      If the IPv4 customer network is an backbone, PET prefers to adopt the
   second method for the following reasons:      
      i)Translation mechanism usually needs application level gateway
        (ALG), which is an application specific agent that allows an
        IPv6 node to communicate with an IPv4 node and vice versa.
        Backbone network requires hardware forwarding for high speed
        transmission. However, it is hard to use hardware to do the work
        of ALG.
     ii)To avoid single point of failure, several PETs usually be
        deployed among networks. They improve performance and robustness
        using dynamic routing mechanisms. However, translation is a
        static process. It is hard to use dynamic routing mechanism.
     iii)At last, some translation mechanisms, such as IVI-based scheme,
        requires IPv4 routing information introducing to IPv6 backbone,
        which will increase the routing base size.      
     Based on the above analyses, PET refers to adopt the second method
  to deal with this scenario. Its operations are shown in Fig.8.

   when an IPv6 packet arrives at PET, it will be translated as an IPv4
   packet and then the PET encapsulates it and sent it to the tunnel
   endpoint PET. When the translated IPv4 packet arrives at the tunnel

5.6. IPv6-IPv4-IPv4

      This is the scenario where an IPv6 customer network wants to talk
   with an IPv4 customer network across IPv4 backbone. This scenario is
   similar to IPv4-IPv6-IPv6 scenario. Hence, PET adopts the similar
   method to deal with this scenario. Its operations are shown in Fig.12
   and Fig.13.

6. Implementation issues
   In this draft, we recommend how to use tunneling and translation
method in each scenario using PETs. However, we do not restrict the
specific tunneling and translation technology that PET adopts. It can
be any transition technology, such as SIIT [RFC 2765], NAT-PT [RFC
2766], BIS [RFC 2767], SOCKS64 [RFC 3089], BIA [RFC 3338], IVI
[draft-ietf-xli-behave-ivi-02],iP-in-IP tunnel [RFC 2893, RFC 4213],
GRE tunnel [RFC 1702], 6to4 tunnel [RFC 2893], 6over4 tunnel [RFC
2529], softwire transition technology [RFC 5565] and so on.
