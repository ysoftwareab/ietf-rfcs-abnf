Internet-Draft               ANAT Semantics                 October 2004


1.  Introduction

   An SDP [2] session description contains the media parameters to be
   used to establish a number of media streams.  For a particular media
   stream, an SDP session description contains, among other parameters,
   the network addresses and the codec to be used to transfer media.
   SDP allows providing a set of codecs per media stream, but only one
   network address.

   Being able to offer a set of network addresses to establish a media
   stream is useful in environments with both IPv4-only hosts and
   IPv6-only hosts, for instance.

   This document defines the Alternative Network Address Types (ANAT)
   semantics for the SDP grouping framework [4].  The ANAT semantics
   allow expressing alternative network addresses (e.g., different IP
   versions) for a particular media stream.

1.1  Scope and Relation with Interactive Connectivity Establishment

   The ANAT semantics are intended to address scenarios that involve
   different network address types (e.g., different IP versions).  They
   are not intended to provide alternative transport addresses with the
   same network type.  Systems that need to provide different transport
   addresses with the same network type should use the SDP format
   defined in ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) [6] instead.

   ICE is used by systems that cannot determine their own transport
   address as seen from the remote end but that can provide several
   possible alternatives.  ICE encodes the address that is most likely
   to be valid in an 'm' line and the rest of addresses as a= lines
   after that 'm' line.  This way, systems that do not support ICE
   simply ignore the a= lines and only use the address in the 'm' line.
   This achieves good backwards compatibility.

   We have chosen to group 'm' lines with different IP versions at the
   'm' level (ANAT semantics) rather than at the a= level (ICE format)
   in order to keep the IPv6 syntax free from ICE parameters used for
   legacy (IPv4) NATs (Network Address Translators).  This yields a
   syntax much closer to vanilla SDP, where IPv6 addresses are defined
   in their own 'm' line, rather than in parameters belonging to a
   different 'm' line.

   Additionally, ICE only allows us to provide a single primary address
   when the peer does not support ICE.  The ANAT semantics avoids
   relegating addresses of a certain type (e.g., IPv6 addresses) to just
   be a secondary alternate to another address type (e.g., IPv4
   addresses).

   Furthermore, the separation between ANAT and ICE helps systems that
   support IPv4 and IPv6 but that do not need to support ICE (e.g., a
   multicast server).

2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1] and indicate requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.

3.  ANAT Semantics

   We define a new ``semantics'' attribute within the SDP grouping
   framework [4]: ANAT (Alternative Network Address Types).

   Media lines grouped using ANAT semantics provide alternative network
   addresses of different types for a single logical media stream.  The
   entity creating a session description with an ANAT group MUST be
   ready to receive (or send) media over any of the grouped 'm' lines.
   The ANAT semantics MUST NOT be used to group media streams whose
   network addresses are of the same type.

4.  Preference

   The entity generating a session description may have an order of
   preference for the alternative network address types offered.  The
   identifiers of the media streams MUST be listed in order of
   preference in the group line.  For an example where the 'm- line with
   mid=1 has a higher preference than the 'm' line with mid=2, see
   Section 6.

5.  Offer/Answer and ANAT

   An offerer using SIP [3] to send its offer SHOULD place the sdp-anat
   option-tag [5] in a Require header field.

   An answerer receiving a session description that uses the ANAT
   semantics SHOULD use the address with highest priority it understands
   and set the ports of the rest of the 'm' lines of the group to zero.

6.  Example

   The session description below contains an IPv4 address and an IPv6
   address grouped using ANAT.  The format correspoding to the mapping
   of ICE into SDP [6] is used in both 'm' lines to provide extra
   addresses.

      a=alt:3 0.4 : user6 9kkso== 192.0.2.1 22334
      a=mid:2


7.  Security Considerations

   An attacker adding group lines using the ANAT semantics to an SDP
   session description could make an end-point use only one out of all
   the streams offered by the remote end, when the intention of the
   remote-end might have been to establish all the streams.

   An attacker removing group lines using ANAT semantics could make and
   end-point establish a higher number of media streams.  If the
   end-point sends media over all of them, the session bandwidth may
   increase dramatically.

   It is thus STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that integrity protection be applied
   to the SDP session descriptions.  For session descriptions carried in
   SIP [3], S/MIME is the natural choice to provide such end-to-end
   integrity protection, as described in RFC 3261.  Other applications
   MAY use a different form of integrity protection.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA needs to register the following new 'semantics' attribute for
   the SDP grouping framework [4]:


   Semantics                            Token      Reference
   ---------------------------------    -----      ---------
   Alternative Network Address Types    ANAT       [RFCxxxx]

   It should be registered in the SDP parameters registry
