<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>The proposed <a class='info' href='#I-D.kucherawy-sender-auth-header'>[I&#8209;D.kucherawy&#8209;sender&#8209;auth&#8209;header]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kucherawy, M., &ldquo;Message Header Field for Indicating Message Authentication Status,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> defines a header field used
        to capture email verification results obtained at border receptions has been approved for
        publication. However, serious deficiencies remain in its secure use and has prompted an
        appeal of the publication decision. This new header field is to convey to Mail User Agents
        (MUA) and downstream processes the verification results that are intended to augment
        handling decisions and message annotations that might be made visible to recipients. For
        such use, it is crucial to include within an "authenticated-results" header, a truly
        authenticated identity.
</p>
<p>The draft acknowledges that it confuses authorization with authentication in section 1.5.2.
        This confusion has lead the draft to incorrectly elevate the authorization of an SMTP client
        into the authentication of an email-address domain. Elevating the *authorization* of the
        SMTP client into the *authentication* of an email-address domain incorrectly assumes current
        email practices adequately restrict the use of an email-address domain based upon the
        originating IP address of the SMTP client. In an era of carrier grade NATs, virtual servers,
        aggregated services, and other techniques that overload the IP address, this assumption is
        neither safe nor practical.
</p>
<p>Although the draft explicitly declares Sender-ID and SPF as the authorization of the
        transmitting SMTP client, it fails to offer the authenticated identity being trusted. A
        truly authenticated identity is essential for reputation assessments which section 4.1
        indicates should be made prior to results being revealed. A reputation check of a truly
        authenticated identifier is often a necessary step needed to mitigate fraud and abuse. In
        addition, it is unfair to attribute fraud or abuse to the unauthenticated identifiers. Even
        so, the header offers no assurance that any reputation check has been made, nor does it
        ensure that an authenticated identity, the IP address of the SMTP client, can be determined
        by the MUA or downstream process. The goal of the appeal is to ensure adequate information
        is available when annotating email.

Introduction</h3>

<p>In the requested review of <a class='info' href='#I-D.otis-auth-header-sec-issues'>[I&#8209;D.otis&#8209;auth&#8209;header&#8209;sec&#8209;issues]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Otis, D., &ldquo;Authentication-Results Header Field Security Issues,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>, Barry Leiba
        made the following remarks:</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>In other words, Doug considers that it's the IP address, not the ADMD, that has been
            "authenticated". I disagree, but this is a tricky area, because we're not wading in a
            typical sort of authentication pool here -- SPF is actually blending identity,
            authentication, and authorization.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>As I see it, the SPF model is that the *identity* to be authenticated is taken from the
            SMTP MAIL FROM command (for Sender-ID it's derived through the PRA algorithm), the IP
            address supplies the authentication *credentials*, and the DNS lookup both verifies the
            credentials (completing the authentication) and returns the authorization information in
            one, combined response ("the entity with these credentials is authorized to send mail on
            behalf of the identity 'example.com'.").
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>Lets start with the *authorization* aspect. When evaluating SPF compliance, it is common
        for virtual SPF records to be used that impose a CIDR range on MX record targets whenever an
        SPF record is not available. As such, SPF results leave the issue of there being any real
        *authorization* in doubt.
</p>
<p>In addition, <a class='info' href='#RFC4406'>Sender-ID<span> (</span><span class='info'>Lyon, J. and M. Wong, &ldquo;Sender ID: Authenticating E-Mail,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4406] in section 2 indicates the use of
        Mail From, in addition to the PRA:</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>On the other hand, the MAIL-FROM version of the test seeks to authenticate the mailbox
            that would receive Delivery Status Notifications (DSNs, or bounces) for the message. In
            simple cases, this too is who the mail is from. However, third-party mailers,
            forwarders, and mailing list servers MUST specify an address under their control, and
            SHOULD arrange that DSNs received at this address are forwarded to the original bounce
            address.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>In both cases, the domain associated with an e-mail address is what is authenticated;
            no attempt is made to authenticate the local-part. A domain owner gets to determine
            which SMTP clients speak on behalf of addresses within the domain; a responsible domain
            owner should not authorize SMTP clients that will lie about local parts.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>Since Sender-ID permits the use of either version of the SPF records to be applied against
        the PRA, version 2 records must then be published whenever authorization of a PRA is not
        intended. This retro-active mandate is to prevent the misapplication of <a class='info' href='#RFC4408'>SPF<span> (</span><span class='info'>Wong, M. and W. Schlitt, &ldquo;Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for Authorizing Use of Domains in E-Mail, Version 1,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4408] records against PRA header fields. The conflict as to whether
        just the Mail From or the PRA has been authorized by SPF version 1 records has left the
        intended scope of the SPF record in doubt.
</p>
<p>The <a class='info' href='#I-D.kucherawy-sender-auth-header'>[I&#8209;D.kucherawy&#8209;sender&#8209;auth&#8209;header]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kucherawy, M., &ldquo;Message Header Field for Indicating Message Authentication Status,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> fails to indicate which version of an
        SPF record had been discovered, or whether any record had been discovered allowing
        recipients a means to gauge risk. It is not just whether SMTP clients lie about local-parts,
        it is whether an IP address ensures only authorizing domains can send the Mail Froms or PRAs
        containing the authorizing domain. Since such IP address restrictions are not in common
        practice, nor can such restrictions be assured not to interfere with existing email
        practices, a premise that SPF authorization implies the authentication of any Mail From or
        PRA from an authorized SMTP client should be regarded as dangerously ill founded. Including
        just the email-address domain as being authenticated makes the header deceptive.
</p>
<p><a class='info' href='#I-D.kucherawy-sender-auth-header'>[I&#8209;D.kucherawy&#8209;sender&#8209;auth&#8209;header]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kucherawy, M., &ldquo;Message Header Field for Indicating Message Authentication Status,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> introduces a header field, which because
        of its label, can mislead recipients into believing that it contains
        "Authentication-Results". The use of phrases rather than result codes belies the draft's
        introductory claim that this header is not intended for direct human consumption. MUAs, such
        as Apple Mail, are able to directly display this header above a message following minor user
        accessible setting changes.
</p>
<p>In the case of Sender-ID or SPF, the deceptive nature of this header could have been
        remedied by including the "authenticated" IP address of the SMTP client, in addition to the
        authorizing domain. This IP address must be passed to the SPF record verification process by
        the receiving MTA, and is essential for either Sender-ID and SPF processing. Only an
        authenticated identity is able to serve as a safe basis for reputation. A reputation check
        of the authenticated source is strongly recommended by section 4.1.
</p>
<p>Without the presence of an authenticated identity within the Authenticated-Results header,
        there can not be any practical or timely remedy against compromised SMTP client access or
        BGP spoofing. With hundreds of millions of compromised systems organized into bot-nets, no
        assumption regarding unauthenticated identifiers should be considered safe. This concern is
        not about allowing MUAs a means to repeat a verification process, the inclusion of the IP
        address of the SMTP client is to provide the MUA or downstream process with the
        authenticated identity that is being trusted to protect the email-address. In the case of
        Sender-ID or SPF, the identity being trusted to protect the use of Mail From or the PRA is
        the SMTP client identified by its IP addresses.
</p>
<p>The places within the <a class='info' href='#I-D.kucherawy-sender-auth-header'>[I&#8209;D.kucherawy&#8209;sender&#8209;auth&#8209;header]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kucherawy, M., &ldquo;Message Header Field for Indicating Message Authentication Status,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> that purport either
        Sender-ID or SPF as authenticating the originating domain overlook the dangerous and
        misleading assumptions needed to arrive at that conclusion. Just as it would not be safe
        give someone a negative credit rating based upon transactions not substantiated through some
        form of authentication, a domain must not be held accountable for incorrect assumptions made
        by receiving MTAs. Doing so would be highly disruptive, coercive, and unfair.
</p>
<p>While there are cases where a domain is controlled by a bad actor, often use of the bad
        domain is brief. Difficulties imposed by Sender-ID or SPF in determining whether a domain
        originated a fraudulent or abusive message also imposes delays in the assignment of negative
        reputations. Any delay is likely to make any effort at protection less effective than when
        using the already authenticated IP address of the SMTP client.
</p>
<p>Negative reputations based upon the IP address of the SMTP client are fairly common, and
        many are automated and assigned nearly immediately. Since security is fragile, whenever a
        server suffers from a security breach, rather than blocking all mail from a domain to
        mitigate fraudulent messages, assigning a negative rating to an affected SMTP client IP
        addresses mitigates a problem without completely blocking all messages from the domain. The
        domain would then be free to issue warning messages regarding the nature of the security
        breach. Such notification would not be possible if only the reputation of the authorizing
        domain was expected to serve as a mitigation solution.

IPv6, SPF macros, and local-parts</h3>

<p>When IPv6 becomes more commonly used, white-listing IP addresses will be needed as a
        solution for dealing with the increased address range. There are currently no practical
        solutions able to scale to the challenging range of IP addresses that might be controlled by
        bad actors. This means problems related to IPv6 will result in the removal of white-listed
        IP addresses.
</p>
<p>Unlike most DNS resources that segregate IPv4 and IPv6 datasets, SPF consolidates both IPv4
        and IPv6 addresses into a common list comprised of a chain of DNS transactions. SPF also
        includes macros used by recipients that can expand the IP address of the SMTP client into
        labels used in subsequent DNS queries. Expressing an IPv6 address using the SPF macro in the
        reverse order nibble form can comprise a query containing more than 32 labels. If the
        local-part macros are used to locate MX records, the MX targets can comprise a set of 100
        separate hostnames. Local-part macros could also be used to chain SPF record sets.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Authentication-Header draft may actually encourage use of this dangerous
        local-part macro. Section 2.4.3 requires local-part authentication before it is to be
        included within the Authentication-Results header. In addition, there is nothing to indicate
        whether the local-part played a role in obtaining SPF results. The danger imposed by the use
        of the local-part macro is inherent in the query required to support both an IPv6 expansion,
        in conjunction with the expansion of local-part macros induced by possibly cached SPF
        records. The local-part, along with a range of IP addresses made readily possible by IPv6,
        can be manipulated to induce a flurry of large DNS transactions directed toward any
        otherwise uninvolved domain, all directed by cached DNS records.
</p>
<p>The SPF local-part macro would allow a cached DNS record to be repeatedly exploited by a
        spam campaign without the attacker consuming any of their additional resources beyond that
        used to send their spam campaign. It is never a good idea to allow free attacks. The
        previous draft regarding the SPF DoS concern was never fully understood, nor was the basis
        of the concern acknowledged by SPF proponents.
</p>
<p>Logically, local-part macros would not safely provide a positive result without the query
        also being combined with the IP address list of authorized SMTP clients in some form. This
        means an address list structure would need to be repeated for each of the domain's users.
        Rcpt To provides a simpler, lower overhead, and more expedient way to determine whether a
        NDN should be returned without the risk associated with SPF's active content being placed
        within DNS resource records. Several parsers ignore local-part macro expansion since they
        rarely play any role in providing positive results.
</p>
<p>The typical target of a DDoS attack is often not the email-providers that might enable the
        attack. Often attacks are directed toward those attempting to mitigate abuse by issuing the
        status of a range of IP addresses. Since these protective services may have been problematic
        for the providers, there exists a level of animosity toward what may appear to be
        conflicting goals.

Recommended Modifications</h3>

<p>Change Section 2.4.3 FROM:
</p>
<p>If the retrieved sender policies used to evaluate [SPF] and [SENDERID] do not contain
        explicit provisions for authenticating the local-part (see section 3.4.1 of [MAIL]) of an
        address, the "pvalue" reported along with results for these mechanisms SHOULD NOT include
        the local-part. 
</p>
<p>TO:
</p>
<p>To discourage exploitation risks, the entity that has been authenticated (the IP address of
        the SMTP client) SHOULD BE included. The "pvalue" reported along with results for these
        mechanisms SHOULD NOT include the local-part, but instead the local-part SHOULD BE replaced
        with the IP address used to evaluate the SPF record after being converted to a string using
        conventional dotted quad notation for IPv4, or the 16 bit hexadecimal notation defined by
          <a class='info' href='#RFC3513'>[RFC3513]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hinden, R. and S. Deering, &ldquo;Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Addressing Architecture,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>, section 2.2, and terminated by the "@" symbol.
</p>
<p>Change Section 4 FROM:
</p>
<p>End users making direct use of this header field may inadvertently trust information that
        has not been properly vetted. If, for example, a basic [SPF] result were to be relayed which
        claims an authenticated addr-spec, the local-part of that addr-spec has actually not been
        authenticated. Thus, an MTA adding this header field SHOULD NOT include any data which has
        not been authenticated by the method(s) being applied. Moreover, MUAs SHOULD NOT render to
        users such information if it is presented by a method known not to authenticate it.
</p>
<p>TO:
</p>
<p>End users making direct use of this header field may inadvertently trust information that
        has not been properly vetted. [SPF] results SHOULD BE handled as specified by section 3.4.3.
        In general, an MTA adding this header field SHOULD NOT include any data which has not been
        authenticated by the method(s) being applied. Moreover, MUAs SHOULD NOT render to users such
        information if it is presented by a method known not to authenticate it. An exception is to
        be made for an Authorizing domain only when it accompanies the authenticated IP address of
        the SMTP client.
