Abstract

   This draft defines an event package that allows a network entity to
   request to be notified of changes in the registration state of a
   particular user.  Subscription and notification of registration state
   is supported by defining an event package within the general  SIP
   event notification event framework.  This event package is based on
   the Presence event package as specified in [3] and therefore this
   draft only describes the deltas to the Presence event package.

1. Introduction

   In some environments user equipment or network entities require
   information about the registration state of a user.  This
   registration state information is identical with the existing
   presence information regarding coding and handling, but may
   additionally be associated with the users authentication to the
   network, i.e.  if a user is registered he is also regarded as
   authenticated against network and if the user is de-registered also
   the authentication is no longer valid.  This information is handled
   and stored by the registrar, which also handles the authentication
   procedures.  Due to this, the set of entities which are allowed to
   subscribe to this event package will be different from the one that
   is allowed to subscribe to the same users presence information.

   This specification creates a new registration event package within
   the general SIP event notification framework as specified in [2].
   This event package is based on the Presence event package as
   described in [3].

   An environment as described above may additionally require the
   network capability to request re-authentication from the user, which
   is, in this case, identical with a re-registration.  For this purpose
   the additional state "re-authenticate" is defined for the
   registration state event package, which is not part of the already
   existing presence data format.

   An entity that is interested in the registration state of a
   particular user subscribes to registration event package at the users
   registrar.  The data format used for notification of the subscriber
   is based on the Presence data format as it is specified in [4].

2. Registration State Event package

   The SIP event framework [2] defines a SIP extension for subscribing
   to, and receiving notifications of, events.  It leaves the definition
   of many additional aspects of these events to concrete extensions,
   also known as event packages.  This document qualifies as an event
   package.  This section fills in the information required by [2].
   However, since this event package is based on the Presence event
   package only the differences between both packages are described.

2.1 Event package name

   The name of this package is "registration-state".  As specified in
   [2], this header appears in SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY requests.

   Example:

   Event: registration-state

2.2 Event package parameters

   No differences to the Presence event package.

2.3 SUBSCRIBE bodies

   This package does not define a SUBSCRIBE body

2.4 Subscription duration

   No differences to the Presence event package.

2.5 NOTIFY bodies

   As described in [3], the NOTIFY request contains a presence document
   with the difference that the presence document used for this event
   package describes the registration state of the presentity.  The
   registration state is described using the same data format as in [3]
   with an additional extension as defined in section 3.

2.6 Notifier processing of SUBSCRIBE requests

   The notifier processing of SUBSCRIBE requests is the same as
   described in [3], whereas the notifier in this case corresponds to
   the registrar.

2.7 Notifier generation of NOTIFY requests

   The rules for generation of NOTIFY requests by the notifier are the

   same as the ones described in [3], whereas the notifier in this case
   corresponds to the registrar.

2.8 Subscriber processing of NOTIFY requests

   No differences to the Presence event package.

2.9 Handling of forked requests

   No differences to the Presence event package.

2.10 Rate of notifications

   No differences to the Presence event package.

3. Registration state data format

   The registration state data format is based on the presence data
   format as specified in [4].  The registration states that need to be
   conveyed are "registered", "deregistered" and "re-authenticate".  The
   registration states "registered" and "deregistered" can be mapped to
   the basic presence status values "open" and "closed".  In order to
   indicate the additional state "re-authenticate" an extension is
   defined in this document according to the rules specified in [4].  As
   described there, all elements and attributes are associated with a
   "namespace", which is in turn associated with a globally unique URI.
   The namespace URI for elements defined by this document is a URN
   [URN], using the namespace identifier 'ietf' defined by [URN-NS-IETF]
   and extended by [URN-SUB-NS]:

   urn:ietf:params:cpim-presence:registration-state

   The tuple id element is used in this event package to identify the
   adress to which the registration state applies.  The registration
   state data format therefore may look like:

       <presence xmlns="urn:ietf:params:cpim-presence:"
                          entity="sip:shingo@jp.fujitsu.com"/>
          <tuple id="shingo_1@jp.fujitsu.com">
            <status>
              <value>open</value>
            </status>
          <tuple id="shingo_2jp.fujitsu.com">
             <status>
               <value>open</value>
               <value
                  type="urn:ietf:params:cpim-presence:registration-state>re-authenticate</value>
             </status>
       </presence>

4. IANA considerations

   This memo calls for IANA to:

      - register a new XML namespace URN per [draft-mealling-iana-xmlns-
      registry-03].

   The registration templates for these are below.  It calls for the
   creation of a new registry for status type values, and corresponding
   URN assignments per [draft-mealling-iana-urn-02].  The new registry
   and initial registrations are described at section 7.3 below.

   URN sub-namespace registration for urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:cpim-
   pidf:registration-state

      URI

      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:cpim-pidf:registration-state

      Description:

      This is the XML namespace URI for XML elements defined by
      [RFCXXXX] to describe CPIM presence information in application/
      cpim-pidf+xml content type.
