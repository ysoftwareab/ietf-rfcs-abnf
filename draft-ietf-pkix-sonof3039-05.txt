Abstract

   This document forms a certificate profile, based on RFC 3280, for
   identity certificates issued to natural persons.

   The profile defines specific conventions for certificates that are
   qualified within a defined legal framework, named Qualified
   Certificates. The profile does however not define any legal
   requirements for such Qualified Certificates.

   The goal of this document is to define a certificate profile that
   supports issuance of Qualified Certificates independent of local
   legal requirements.  The profile is however not limited to Qualified
   Certificates and further profiling may facilitate specific local
   needs.

INTERNET DRAFT       Qualified Certificates Profile        February 2004


1 Introduction

   This specification is one part of a family of standards for the X.509
   Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for the Internet.  It is based on RFC
   3280, which defines underlying certificate formats and semantics
   needed for a full implementation of this standard.

   This profile includes specific mechanisms intended for use with
   Qualified Certificates.  The term Qualified Certificates and the
   assumptions that affects the scope of this document are discussed in
   Section 2.

   Section 3 defines requirements on certificate information content.
   This profile addresses two fields in the basic certificate as well as
   five certificate extensions.  The certificate fields are the subject
   and issuer fields.  The certificate extensions are subject directory
   attributes, certificate policies, key usage, a certificate extension
   for storage of biometric data and a certificate extension for storage
   of statements related to Qualified Certificates.  The certificate
   extensions are presented in the 1997 Abstract Syntax Notation One
   (ASN.1), but in conformance with RFC 3280 the 1988 ASN.1 module in
   Appendix A contains all normative definitions (the 1997 module in
   Appendix A is informative).

   In Section 4, some security considerations are discussed in order to
   clarify the security context in which the standard may be utilized.
   Section 5 contains the references.

   Appendix A contains all relevant ASN.1 [X.680] structures that are
   not already defined in RFC 3280.  Appendix B contains a note on
   attributes.  Appendix C contains an example certificate.  Appendix D
   contains authors' addresses and Appendix E contains the IETF
   Copyright Statement.

1.1  Changes since RFC 3039

   This specification obsoletes RFC 3039.  This specification differs
   from RFC 3039 in the following basic areas:

      * Some editorial clarifications has been made to introductory
      sections to clarify that this profile is generally applicable to a
      broad type of certificates even if its prime purpose is to
      facilitate issuance of Qualified Certificates.

      * To align with RFC 3280, support for domainComponent and title
      attribues in subject names are included, and postalAddress is no
      longer supported.




Santesson, Nystrom, & Polk                                      [Page 3]

INTERNET DRAFT       Qualified Certificates Profile        February 2004


      * To align with actual usage, support for the title attribute in
      the subject directory attributes extension is no longer supported.

      * To better facilitate broad applicability of this profile some
      constraints on key usage settings in the key usage extension have
      been removed.

      * A new qc-Statement reflecting this second version of the profile
      has been defined in Section 3.2.6.1. This profile obsoletes RFC
      3039 but the qc-statement reflecting compliance with RFC 3039 is
      also defined for backwards compatibility.


1.2  Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

2  Requirements and Assumptions

   The term "Qualified Certificate" is used by the European Directive on
   Electronic Signature [EU-ESDIR] to refer to a specific type of
   certificates, with appliance in European electronic signature
   legislation. This specification is intended to support this class of
   certificates, but its scope is not limited to this application.

   Within this standard the term "Qualified Certificate" is used
   generally, describing a certificate whose primary purpose is to
   identify a person with high level of assurance, where the certificate
   meets some qualification requirements defined by an applicable legal
   framework, such as the European Directive on Electronic Signature
   [EU-ESDIR]. The actual mechanisms that decide whether a certificate
   should or should not be considered to be a "Qualified Certificate" in
   regard to any legislation are outside the scope of this standard.

   Harmonization in the field of identity certificates issued to natural
   persons, in particular Qualified Certificates, is essential within
   several aspects that fall outside the scope of RFC 3280.  The most
   important aspects that affect the scope of this specification are:


   -  Definition of names and identity information in order to identify
      the associated subject in a uniform way.

   -  Definition of information which identifies the CA and the
      jurisdiction under which the CA operates when issuing a particular
      certificate.



Santesson, Nystrom, & Polk                                      [Page 4]

INTERNET DRAFT       Qualified Certificates Profile        February 2004


   -  Definition of key usage extension usage for Qualified
      Certificates.

   -  Definition of information structure for storage of biometric
      information.

   -  Definition of a standardized way to store predefined statements
      with relevance for Qualified Certificates.

   -  Requirements for critical extensions.



2.1  Properties

   This profile accommodates profiling needs for Qualified Certificates
   based on the assumptions that:


   -  Qualified Certificates are issued by a CA that makes a statement
      that the certificate serves the purpose of a Qualified
      Certificate, as discussed in Section 2.2.

   -  The Qualified Certificate indicates a certificate policy
      consistent with liabilities, practices and procedures undertaken
      by the CA, as discussed in Section 2.3.

   -  The Qualified Certificate is issued to a natural person (living
      human being).

   -  The Qualified Certificate contains a name which may be either
      based on the real name of the subject or a pseudonym.


2.2  Statement of Purpose

   This profile defines conventions to declare within a certificate that
   it serves the purpose of being a Qualified Certificate. This enables
   the CA to explicitly define this intent.

   The function of this declaration is thus to assist any concerned
   entity in evaluating the risk associated with creating or accepting
   signatures that are based on a Qualified Certificate.

   This profile defines two complementary ways to include this
   information:





Santesson, Nystrom, & Polk                                      [Page 5]

INTERNET DRAFT       Qualified Certificates Profile        February 2004


   -  As information defined by a certificate policy included in the
      certificate policies extension, and

   -  As a statement included in the Qualified Certificates Statements
      extension.


2.3  Policy Issues

   Certain policy aspects define the context in which this profile is to
   be understood and used.  It is however outside the scope of this
   profile to specify any policies or legal aspects that will govern
   services that issue or utilize certificates according to this
   profile.

   It is however an underlying assumption in this profile that a
   responsible issuing CA will undertake to follow a certificate policy
   that is consistent with its liabilities, practices and procedures.

2.4  Uniqueness of names

   Distinguished name is originally defined in X.501 [X.501] as a
   representation of a directory name, defined as a construct that
   identifies a particular object from among the set of all objects. The
   distinguished name MUST be unique for each subject entity certified
   by the one CA as defined by the issuer name field, during the whole
   life time of the CA.

INTERNET DRAFT       Qualified Certificates Profile        February 2004


3  Certificate and Certificate Extensions Profile

   This section defines certificate profiling conventions.  The profile
   is based on the Internet certificate profile RFC 3280 which in turn
   is based on the X.509 version 3 format.  For full implementation of
   this section implementers are REQUIRED to consult the underlying
   formats and semantics defined in RFC 3280.

   ASN.1 definitions relevant for this section that are not supplied by
   RFC 3280 are supplied in Appendix A.

3.1  Basic Certificate Fields

   This specification provides additional details regarding the contents
   of two fields in the basic certificate.  These fields are the issuer
   and subject fields.

3.1.1  Issuer

   The issuer field SHALL identify the organization responsible for
   issuing the certificate.  The name SHOULD be an officially registered
   name of the organization.

   The distinguished name of the issuer SHALL be specified using an
   appropriate subset of the following attributes:


         domainComponent;
         countryName;
         stateOrProvinceName;
         organizationName;
         localityName; and
         serialNumber.


   Additional attributes MAY be present but they SHOULD NOT be necessary
   to identify the issuing organization.

   A relying party MAY have to consult associated certificate policies
   and/or the issuer's CPS, in order to determine the semantics of name
   fields.

3.1.2  Subject

   The subject field of a certificate compliant with this profile SHALL
   contain a distinguished name of the subject (see 2.4 for definition
   of distinguished name).




Santesson, Nystrom, & Polk                                      [Page 7]

INTERNET DRAFT       Qualified Certificates Profile        February 2004


   The subject field SHALL contain an appropriate subset of the
   following attributes:


      domainComponent;
      countryName;
      commonName;
      surname;
      givenName;
      pseudonym;
      serialNumber;
      title;
      organizationName;
      organizationalUnitName;
      stateOrProvinceName; and
      localityName.


   Other attributes MAY also be present; however, the use of other
   attributes MUST NOT be necessary to distinguish one subject name from
   another subject name.  That is, the attributes listed above are
   sufficient to ensure unique subject names.

   Of these attributes, the subject field SHALL include at least one of
   the following:


      Choice   I:  commonName
      Choice  II:  givenName
      Choice III:  pseudonym


      The countryName attribute value specifies a general context in
      which other attributes are to be understood.  The country
      attribute does not necessarily indicate the subject's country of
      citizenship or country of residence, nor does it have to indicate
      the country of issuance.

   Note: Many X.500 implementations require the presence of countryName
   in the DIT.  In cases where the subject name, as specified in the
   subject field, specifies a public X.500 directory entry, the
   countryName attribute SHOULD always be present.

      The commonName attribute value SHALL, when present, contain a name
      of the subject.  This MAY be in the subject's preferred
      presentation format, or a format preferred by the CA, or some
      other format. Pseudonyms, nicknames and names with spelling other
      than defined by the registered name MAY be used.  To understand



Santesson, Nystrom, & Polk                                      [Page 8]

INTERNET DRAFT       Qualified Certificates Profile        February 2004


      the nature of the name presented in commonName, complying
      applications MAY have to examine present values of the givenName
      and surname attributes, or the pseudonym attribute.

      Note: Many client implementations presuppose the presence of the
      commonName attribute value in the subject field and use this value
      to display the subject's name regardless of present givenName,
      surname or pseudonym attribute values.

      The surname and givenName attribute types SHALL be used in the
      subject field if neither the commonName attribute nor the
      pseudonym attribute is present. In cases where the subject only
      has a givenName the surname attribute SHALL be omitted.

      The pseudonym attribute type SHALL, if present, contain a
      pseudonym of the subject.  Use of the pseudonym attribute MUST NOT
      be combined with use of any of the attributes surname and/or
      givenName.

      The serialNumber attribute type SHALL, when present, be used to
      differentiate between names where the subject field would
      otherwise be identical.  This attribute has no defined semantics
      beyond ensuring uniqueness of subject names.  It MAY contain a
      number or code assigned by the CA or an identifier assigned by a
      government or civil authority.  It is the CA's responsibility to
      ensure that the serialNumber is sufficient to resolve any subject
      name collisions.

      The title attribute type SHALL, when present, be used to store a
      designated position or function of the subject within the
      organization specified by present organizational attributes in the
      subject field.  The association between the title, the subject and
      the organization is beyond the scope of this document.

      The organizationName and the organizationalUnitName attribute
      types SHALL, when present, be used to store the name and relevant
      information of an organization with which the subject is
      associated. The type of association between the organization and
      the subject is beyond the scope of this document.

      The stateOrProvinceName and the localityName attribute types
      SHALL, when present, be used to store geographical information
      with which the subject is associated.  If an organizationName
      value also is present then the stateOrProvinceName and
      localityName attribute values SHALL be associated with the
      specified organization.  The type of association between the
      stateOrProvinceName and the localityName and either the subject or
      the organizationName is beyond the scope of this document.



Santesson, Nystrom, & Polk                                      [Page 9]

INTERNET DRAFT       Qualified Certificates Profile        February 2004


   Compliant implementations SHALL be able to interpret the attributes
   named in this section.

3.2  Certificate Extensions

   This specification provides profiles for two certificate fields:
   issuer and subject; it also provides profiles for four certificate
   extensions defined in RFC 3280: subject alternate name, subject
   directory attributes, certificate policies and key usage. This
   specification defines two additional extensions: biometric
   information and qualified certificate statements.

3.2.1  Subject Alternative Name

   If the subjectAltName extension is present and it contains a
   directoryName name, then the directoryName MUST follow the
   conventions specified in section 3.1.2 of this profile.

3.2.2  Subject Directory Attributes

   The subjectDirectoryAttributes extension MAY contain additional
   attributes, associated with the subject, as complement to present
   information in the subject field and the subject alternative name
   extension.

   Attributes suitable for storage in this extension are attributes,
   which are not part of the subject's distinguished name, but which MAY
   still be useful for other purposes (e.g., authorization).

   This extension MUST NOT be marked critical.

   Compliant implementations SHALL be able to interpret the following
   attributes:


      dateOfBirth;
      placeOfBirth;
      gender;
      countryOfCitizenship; and
      countryOfResidence.


   Other attributes MAY be included according to local definitions.

   The dateOfBirth attribute SHALL, when present, contain the value of
   the date of birth of the subject.  The manner in which the date of
   birth is associated with the subject is outside the scope of this
   document. The date of birth is defined in the GeneralizedTime format



Santesson, Nystrom, & Polk                                     [Page 10]

INTERNET DRAFT       Qualified Certificates Profile        February 2004


   and SHOULD specify GMT 12.00.00 (noon) down to the granularity of
   seconds in order to prevent accidental change of date due to time
   zone adjustments. For example, a birth date of September 27, 1959 is
   encoded as "19590927120000Z". Compliant certificate parsing
   applications SHOULD ignore any time data and just present the
   contained date without any time zone adjustments.

   The placeOfBirth attribute SHALL, when present, contain the value of
   the place of birth of the subject.  The manner in which the place of
   birth is associated with the subject is outside the scope of this
   document.

   The gender attribute SHALL, when present, contain the value of the
   gender of the subject.  For females the value "F" (or "f") and for
   males the value "M" (or "m") have to be used.  The manner in which
   the gender is associated with the subject is outside the scope of
   this document.

   The countryOfCitizenship attribute SHALL, when present, contain the
   identifier of at least one of the subject's claimed countries of
   citizenship at the time that the certificate was issued. If more than
   one country of citizenship is specified, then each country of
   citizenship SHOULD be specified through a separate, single-valued
   countryOfCitizenship attribute. Determination of citizenship is a
   matter of law and is outside the scope of this document.

   The countryOfResidence attribute SHALL, when present, contain the
   value of at least one country in which the subject is resident.  If
   more than one country of residence is specified, then each country of
   residence SHOULD be specified through a separate, single-valued
   countryOfResidence attribute. Determination of residence is a matter
   of law and is outside the scope of this document.

3.2.3 Certificate Policies

   The certificate policies extension SHALL contain the identifier of at
   least one certificate policy which reflects the practices and
   procedures undertaken by the CA.  The certificate policy extension
   MAY be marked critical.

   Information provided by the issuer stating the purpose of the
   certificate as discussed in Section 2.2 SHOULD be evident through
   indicated policies.

   The certificate policies extension MUST include all policy
   information needed for certification path validation. If policy
   information is included in the QCStatements extension (see 3.2.6),
   then this information SHOULD also be defined by indicated policies.



Santesson, Nystrom, & Polk                                     [Page 11]

INTERNET DRAFT       Qualified Certificates Profile        February 2004


   Certificate policies MAY be combined with any qualifier defined in
   RFC 3280.

3.2.4  Key Usage

   The key usage extension SHALL be present. Key usage settings SHALL be
   set in accordance with RFC 3280 definitions. Further requirements on
   key usage settings MAY be defined by local policy and/or local legal
   requirements.

   The key usage extension SHOULD be marked critical.

3.2.5  Biometric Information

   This section defines an extension for storage of biometric
   information.  Biometric information is stored in the form of a hash
   of a biometric template.

   The purpose of this extension is to provide means for authentication
   of biometric information.  The biometric information that corresponds
   to the stored hash is not stored in this extension, but the extension
   MAY include an URI referencing a file containing this information.
   If included, this URI does not imply that this is the only way to
   access this information.

   It is RECOMMENDED that biometric information in this extension is
   limited to information types suitable for human verification, i.e.,
   where the decision of whether the information is an accurate
   representation of the subject is naturally performed by a person.
   This implies a usage where the biometric information is represented
   by, for example, a graphical image displayed to the relying party,
   which MAY be used by the relying party to enhance identification of
   the subject.

   This extension MUST NOT be marked critical.

      biometricInfo  EXTENSION ::= {
          SYNTAX             BiometricSyntax
          IDENTIFIED BY      id-pe-biometricInfo }

      id-pe-biometricInfo OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::= {id-pe 2}

      BiometricSyntax ::= SEQUENCE OF BiometricData

      BiometricData ::= SEQUENCE {
          typeOfBiometricData  TypeOfBiometricData,
          hashAlgorithm        AlgorithmIdentifier,
          biometricDataHash    OCTET STRING,

          sourceDataUri        IA5String OPTIONAL }

      TypeOfBiometricData ::= CHOICE {
          predefinedBiometricType    PredefinedBiometricType,
          biometricDataID            OBJECT IDENTIFIER }

      PredefinedBiometricType ::= INTEGER { picture(0),
          handwritten-signature(1)} (picture|handwritten-signature,...)

   The predefined biometric type picture, when present, SHALL identify
   that the source picture is in the form of a displayable graphical
   image of the subject.  The hash of the graphical image SHALL be
   calculated over the whole referenced image file.

   The predefined biometric type handwritten-signature, when present,
   SHALL identify that the source data is in the form of a displayable
   graphical image of the subject's handwritten signature.  The hash of
   the graphical image SHALL only be calculated over the image data
   excluding any labels defining the image type.

3.2.6  Qualified Certificate Statements

   This section defines an extension for inclusion of statements
   defining explicit properties of the certificate.

   A statement suitable for inclusion in this extension MAY be a
   statement by the issuer that the certificate is issued as a Qualified
   Certificate in accordance with a particular legal system (as
   discussed in Section 2.2).

   Other statements suitable for inclusion in this extension MAY be
   statements related to the applicable legal jurisdiction within which
   the certificate is issued.  As an example this MAY include a maximum
   reliance limit for the certificate indicating restrictions on CA's
   liability.

   Each statement SHALL include an object identifier for the statement
   and MAY also include optional qualifying data contained in the
   statementInfo parameter.

   If the statementInfo parameter is included then the object identifier
   of the statement SHALL define the syntax and SHOULD define the
   semantics of this parameter.  If the object identifier does not

3.2.6.1 Predefined Statements

   The certificate statement (id-qcs-pkixQCSyntax-v1), identifies
   conformance with section 3 of the obsoleted RFC 3039 (Version 1).
   This statement is provided for identification of old certificates
   issued in conformance with RFC 3039. This statement MUST NOT be
   included in certificates issued in accordance with this profile.

   This profile includes a new qualified certificate statement
   (identified by the OID id-qcs-pkixQCSyntax-v2), identifying
   conformance with section 3 of this profile.  This Qualified
   Certificate profile is referred to as version 2 while RFC 3039 is
   referred to as version 1.

           WITH COMPONENTS {..., nameRegistrationAuthorities PRESENT})

      NameRegistrationAuthorities ::=  SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF
          GeneralName

   The SementicsInformation component identified by id-qcs-
   pkixQCSyntax-v1 MAY contain a semantics identifier and MAY identify
   one or more name registration authorities.

   The semanticsIdentifier component, if present, SHALL contain an OID,
   defining semantics for attributes and names in basic certificate
   fields and certificate extensions.  The OID may define semantics for
   all, or for a subgroup of all present attributes and/or names.

   The NameRegistrationAuthorities component, if present, SHALL contain
   a name of one or more name registration authorities, responsible for
   registration of attributes or names associated with the subject.  The
   association between an identified name registration authority and
   present attributes MAY be defined by a semantics identifier OID, by a
   certificate policy (or CPS) or some other implicit factors.

   If a value of type SemanticsInformation is present in a QCStatement
   where the statementID component is set to id-qcs-pkix-QCSyntax-v1 or
   id-qcs-pkix-QCSyntax-v2, then at least one of the semanticsIdentifier
   or nameRegistrationAuthorities fields must be present, as indicated.
   Note that the statementInfo component need not be present in a
   QCStatement value even if the statementID component is set to id-qcs-
   pkix-QCSyntax-v1 or id-qcs-pkix-QCSyntax-v2.

4  Security Considerations

   The legal value of a digital signature that is validated with a
   Qualified Certificate will be highly dependent upon the policy
   governing the use of the associated private key.  Both the private
   key holder as well as the relying party should make sure that the
   private key is used only with the consent of the legitimate key
   holder.

   Since the public keys are for public use with legal implications for
   involved parties, certain conditions should exist before CAs issue
   certificates as Qualified Certificates.  The associated private keys
   must be unique for the subject, and must be maintained under the
   subject's sole control.  That is, a CA should not issue a qualified
   certificate if the means to use the private key is not protected
   against unintended usage.  This implies that the CA has some
   knowledge about the subject's cryptographic module.

   The CA must further verify that the public key contained in the
   certificate is legitimately representing the subject.

   CAs should not issue CA certificates with policy mapping extensions
   indicating acceptance of another CA's policy unless these conditions
   are met.

   Combining the nonRepudiation bit in the keyUsage certificate
   extension with other keyUsage bits may have security implications
   depending on the context in which the certificate is to be used.
   Applications validating electronic signatures based on such
   certificates should determine whether the present key usage
   combination is appropriate for their use.

   The ability to compare two qualified certificates to determine if
   they represent the same physical entity is dependent on the semantics
   of the subjects' names.  The semantics of a particular attribute may
   be different for different issuers.  Comparing names without
   knowledge of the semantics of names in these particular certificates
   may provide misleading results.

   This specification is a profile of RFC 3280.  The security
   considerations section of that document applies to this specification
   as well.

A. ASN.1 definitions

   As in RFC 3280, ASN.1 modules are supplied in two different variants
   of the ASN.1 syntax.

   Appendix A.1 is in the 1988 syntax, and does not use macros. However,
   since the module imports type definitions from modules in RFC 3280
   which are not completely in the 1988 syntax, the same comments as in
   RFC 3280 regarding its use applies here as well; i.e., Appendix A.1
   may be parsed by an 1988 ASN.1-parser by removing the definitions for
   the UNIVERSAL types and all references to them in RFC 3280's 1988
   modules.

   Appendix A.2 is in the 1997 syntax.

   In case of discrepancies between these modules, the 1988 module is
   the normative one.

B. A Note on Attributes

   This document defines several new attributes, both for use in the
   subject field of issued certificates and in the
   subjectDirectoryAttributes extension.  A complete definition of these
   new attributes (including matching rules), along with object classes
   to support them in LDAP-accessible directories, can be found in [PKCS
   9].

C. Example Certificate

   This section contains the ASN.1 structure, an ASN.1 dump, and the
   DER-encoding of a certificate issued in conformance with this
   profile.  The example has been developed with the help of the OSS
   ASN.1 compiler.  The certificate has the following characteristics:

      1.  The certificate is signed with RSA and the SHA-1 hash
          algorithm
      2.  The issuer's distinguished name is O=GMD - Forschungszentrum
          Informationstechnik GmbH; C=DE
      3.  The subject's distinguished name is CN=Petra M.  Barzin, O=GMD
          - Forschungszentrum Informationstechnik GmbH, C=DE
      4.  The certificate was issued on May 1, 2000 and will expire on
          November 1, 2000
      5.  The certificate contains a 1024 bit RSA key
      6.  The certificate includes a critical key usage extension
