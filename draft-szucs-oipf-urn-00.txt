Internet-Draft                  OIPF URN                     April 2010


   This document describes a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for
   the Open IPTV Forum (OIPF) for naming persistent resources defined
   within OIPF specifications. Example resources include technical
   documents and specifications, eXtensible Markup Language (XML)
   Schemas, classification schemes, XML Document Type Definitions
   (DTDs), namespaces, style sheets, media assets, and other types of
   resources produced or managed by the OIPF.

1. Introduction

   The Open IPTV Forum (OIPF) is a pan-industry initiative with the
   purpose of producing end-to-end specifications for IPTV that will
   take the next generation of IPTV into the mass market. The Forum,
   which is fully open to participation from the communications,
   entertainment and other relevant industries, will focus on the
   development of specifications that will help streamline and
   accelerate deployments of IPTV technologies, and maximize the
   benefits of IPTV for consumers, network operators, content providers,
   service providers, consumer electronics manufacturers and home and
   network infrastructure providers.

   The main objective of the OIPF is to produce end-to-end
   specifications for IPTV including:

   o  Architecture and interfaces

   o  Network and terminal functionality

   o  Interactive and personalized services

   o  Technology choices for all major functionalities

Internet-Draft                  OIPF URN                     April 2010


   o  A common UNI (User-Network Interface) for the Open Internet and
      Managed Networks

   o  Certification of equipment including end user devices and service
      provider offerings

   The end-to-end specifications support:

   o  A variety of IPTV and Internet multimedia services

   o  Managed networks and the Open Internet

   o  Integration with communication services

   o  Convergence of IPTV and multimedia services across different
      access technologies

   o  Easy integration of 3rd party content offerings

   o  Authentication and content protection

   o  Various devices in the home network

   The OIPF is basing its end-to-end IPTV specification on relevant
   standards produced by other bodies, and collaborating with them to
   encourage convergence where appropriate, and address any shortcomings
   or gaps.

   In the creation of the end-to-end IPTV specification, some new
   resources need to be defined.

   The OIPF would like to assign unique, permanent, location-independent
   names based on URNs for some resources it produces or manages. These
   URNs will be constructed according to the URN syntax defined in
   [RFC2141].

   This namespace specification is for a formal namespace to be
   registered according to the procedures set forth in [RFC3406].

2. URN Specification for the OIPF Namespace Identifier (NID)

Namespace ID:

   "oipf"

Registration Information:

   Version: 1

   Date: 2010-03-22

Declared registrant of the namespace:

   Name:          Mr. Yun Chao Hu

   Title:         President

   Affiliation:   Open IPTV Forum

   Address:       Open IPTV Forum e.V. Secretariat,

   Email:         contact@oipf.tv

Declaration of structure:

   URNs assigned by the OIPF will have the following structure based on
   the organizational structure of the resources specified in the OIPF
   IPTV Solution specifications:

      urn:oipf:<NSS>

   where the syntax of "<NSS>" is specified in Section 2.2 of the URN
   Syntax requirements ([RFC2141]).

   The individual URNs will be assigned by the OIPF through the process
   of development of OIPF specifications.

Relevant ancillary documentation:

   None.

Identifier uniqueness considerations:

   The OIPF will establish unique identifiers as appropriate and will
   ensure that an assigned string is never reassigned.

Identifier persistence considerations:

   The OIPF is committed to maintaining the accessibility and
   persistence of all resources that are officially assigned URNs by the

   organization. The registration tables and information will be
   published and maintained by the OIPF on its web site.

Process of identifier assignment:

   The assignment of identifiers is fully controlled and managed by the
   OIPF.

Process of identifier resolution:

   Not applicable; the "oipf" namespace is not listed with a Resolution
   Discovery System.

Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

   The "<NSS>" is case-insensitive.

Conformance with URN Syntax:

   No special considerations.

Validation mechanism:

   None specified. URN assignment will be managed completely and
   published by the OIPF.

Scope:

   Global

3. Examples

   The following examples of schemas and classification schemes are
   taken from the current OIPF Release 1 IPTV Solution specification:

   urn:oipf:device:ig:1

   urn:oipf:config:oitf:oitfCapabilities:2009

   urn:oipf:iptv:IPTVProfile:2008

   urn:oipf:cs:AVMediaFormatCS:2008

   urn:oipf:cs:ApplicationTypeCS:2009

4. Community Considerations

   URNs defined by the OIPF will be used by implementers of IPTV
   systems, products, and applications based on the OIPF IPTV Solution
   specification. They are an essential component of the open IPTV
   ecosystem that is being facilitated by the OIPF.

5. Namespace Considerations

   A unique formal namespace is required by the OIPF in order to specify
   how the various existing standards can be linked in order to create a
   true end-to-end ecosystem for standards-based IPTV deployments, and
   to provide the necessary system-wide resources.

6. Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.

7. IANA Considerations

   This document defines a URN NID registration of "oipf". IANA is
   requested to include it in the URN Namespaces registry.
