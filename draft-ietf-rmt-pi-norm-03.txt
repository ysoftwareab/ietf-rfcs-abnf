Abstract

     This document describes the messages and procedures of the Nega-
     tive-acknowledgement (NACK) oriented reliable multicast (NORM) pro-
     tocol.  This protocol is designed to provide end-to-end reliable
     transport of bulk data objects or streams over generic IP multicast
     routing and forwarding services.  NORM uses a selective, negative
     acknowledgement mechanism for transport reliability and offers
     additional protocol mechanism to conduct reliable multicast ses-
     sions with little "a priori" coordination among senders and
     receivers.  It is capable of operating with both reciprocal multi-
     cast routing among senders and receivers and with asymmetric

     connectivity (possibly a unicast return path) from the senders to
     receivers.  The protocol offers a number of features to allow dif-
     ferent types of applications or possibly other higher level trans-
     port protocols to utilize its service in different ways.  The pro-
     tocol leverages the use of FEC-based repair and other IETF reliable
     multicast transport (RMT) building blocks in its design.

1.0 Protocol Design Goals

     NORM is designed to provide end-to-end reliable transport of data
     from sender(s) to a group of receivers over a multicast-capable
     network.  The primary design goal of NORM is to provide for effi-
     cient, scalable, and robust bulk data (e.g. computer files, trans-
     mission of persistent data) transfer adaptable (preferably in an
     automated fashion) across heterogeneous networks and topologies.
     The protocol is capable of operating in an end-to-end fashion with
     no assistance from intermediate systems beyond basic IP multicast
     group management and forwarding services.   However, an additional
     design goal will be compatibility with other reliable multicast
     "building blocks" [REF RMT Building Block Guidelines] to take
     advantage of additional network capabilities when available.  Thus,
     while the techniques utilized in NORM are principally applicable to
     "flat" network distribution, they might also be applied to a given
     level of a hierarchical (e.g. tree-based) multicast distribution
     system if so desired.  NORM can make use of reciprocal (among
     senders and receivers) multicast routing when available but will
     also be capable of efficient operation in asymmetric multicast
     topologies [REF single source multicast, etc].

     Group communication scalability requirements leads to adaptation of
     negative acknowledgement (NACK) based protocol schemes [REF.].
     NORM is a protocol centered around the use of selective NACKs to
     request repairs of missing data.  NORM also uses NACK suppression
     methods and dynamic event timers to reduce retransmission requests
     and avoid congestion within the network.  When used in pure multi-
     cast session operation, both NACKs and repair transmissions are
     multicast to the group to aid in feedback and control message sup-
     pression.  This feature and additional message aggregation  func-
     tionality reduce the likelihood of multicast control message implo-
     sion.  NORM also dynamically measures the greatest group roundtrip
     time (GRTT) between sources and the set of multicast receivers to
     further improve the efficiency of the protocol state timers and
     probabilistic backoff algorithms.  This allows NORM to scale well
     while maintaining reliable data delivery transport with low latency
     relative to the network topology over which it is operating.  NORM
     also provides for the use of packet-level forward error correction
     (FEC) techniques for efficient multicast repair and optional proac-
     tive transmission robustness.

     Another aspect of the NORM protocol design is providing support for
     distributed multicast session participation with minimal coordina-
     tion among sources and receivers.  The protocol allows sources and
     receivers to dynamically join and leave multicast sessions at will
     with minimal overhead for control information and timing synchro-
     nization among participants.  To accommodate this capability, NORM
     protocol message headers contain some common information allowing
     receivers to easily synchronize to sources throughout the lifetime
     of a defined session.  These common headers also include support
     for collection of transmission timing information (e.g., round trip
     delays) that allows NORM to adapt itself to a wide range of dynamic
     network conditions with little or no pre-configuration.  The proto-
     col is purposely designed to be tolerant of inaccurate timing esti-
     mations or lossy conditions which may occur many networks includin
     mobile and wireless.  The protocol is also designed to exhibit con-
     vergence even under cases of heavy packet loss and large queueing
     or transmission delays.

     While the various features of NORM are designed to provide some
     measure of general purpose utility, it is important to emphasize
     the understanding that "no one size fits all" in the reliable mul-
     ticast transport  arena.  There are numerous engineering tradeoffs
     involved in reliable multicast transport design and this requires
     an increased awareness of application and network architecture con-
     siderations.  Performance requirements affecting design can
     include:  group size, heterogeneity (e.g., capacity and/or delay),
     asymmetric delivery, data ordering, delivery delay, group dynamics,
     mobility, congestion control, and transport across low capacity
     connections.  NORM contains various protocol parameters to accommo-
     date many of these differing requirements, but there is an assumed
     model of bulk transfer transport service that drives the trade-offs
     resulting in the protocol described here.

1.1 NORM Transport Service Model

     An instance of the NORM protocol (NormSession) is defined within
     the context of one or more senders and receivers mutually communi-
     cating with prdefined IP addresses and host port(s).  While point-
     to-point (unicast) NormSessions may be established between a pair
     of protocol participants (NormNodes), it is anticipated the proto-
     col will be used for multicast data distribution and that partici-
     pating nodes will communicate on a common IP multicast group
     address and port number which has been chosen via other means (e.g.
     MBONE session directory tools, administrative coordination, SIP
     signalling, etc).  Note that the protocol provides for an optional
     mechanism for receiver nodes to use unicast addressing to provide
     feedback to senders in networks where this is required (e.g. Single
     Source Multicast Routing, asymmetric topologies, etc).

Internet Draft                NORM Protocol                November 2001


     The protocol design is principally driven with the assumption of a
     single sender transmitting bulk data content to a group of
     receivers.  However, the protocol does provide for multiple senders
     to coexist within the context of a NormSession.  In initial imple-
     mentations of this protocol, it is anticipated that multiple
     senders will transmit independently of one another and receivers
     will maintain state as necessary for each independent sender.  In
     future iterations of this document, it is possible that some
     aspects of protocol operation (e.g. round-trip time collection)
     will provide for alternate modes allowing more efficient perfor-
     mance for applications requiring multiple senders.

     NORM provides for three types of bulk data content objects (NormOb-
     jects) to be reliably transported.  These types include static com-
     puter memory data content (NORM_OBJECT_DATA), computer storage
     files (NORM_OBJECT_FILE), and non-finite streams of continuous data
     content (NORM_OBJECT_STREAM).  The distinction between
     NORM_OBJECT_DATA and NORM_OBJECT_FILE is simply to provide a "hint"
     to receivers in NormSessions serving multiple types of content as
     to what type of storage should be allocated for received content
     (i.e. memory or file storage).  Other than that distinction, the
     two are identical, providing for reliable transport of finite units
     of content.  The use of the NORM_OBJECT_STREAM type is at the
     application's discretion and conceivably be used to carry static
     data or file content also.  Reliable stream service also opens up
     other possibilities such as reliable messaging or other unbounded,
     perhaps dynamically produced content.  The NORM_OBJECT_STREAM pro-
     vides for reliable transport analogous to that of the Transmission
     Control Protocol (TCP) although NORM receivers will be able to
     begin receiving stream content at any point in time (The applica-
     bility of this feature will depend upon the application). The
     static data and file services are anticpated to be useful for mul-
     ticast-based cache applications with the ability to reliably pro-
     vide transmission/repair of a large set of static data.  Other
     types of static data/file "casting" services might make use of
     these transport object types, too.  The NORM protocol allows for a
     small amount of "out-of-band" data (NORM_INFO) to be attached to
     the data content objects transmitted by the sender.  This readily-
     available "out-of-band" data allows multicast receivers to quickly
     and efficiently determine the nature of the bulk content (data,
     file, or stream) being transmitted to allow application-level con-
     trol of the receiver node's participation in the current transport
     activity.  This allows the protocol to be flexible with minimal
     pre-coordination among senders and receivers.

     NORM does _not_ provide for global or application-level identifica-
     tion of data content within in its message headers (It should be
     noted that the NORM_INFO out-of-band data mechanism can be

     leveraged by the application for this purpose if desired, or iden-
     tification could alternatively be embedded within the data con-
     tent).  NORM identifies data content objects (NormObjects) with
     transport identifiers which are applicable while the sender is
     transmitting and/or repairing the given object.  These transport
     data content identifiers are assigned in a montonically increasing
     fashion by each NORM sender during the course of a NormSession.
     Each sender maintains its transport identifier assignments indepen-
     dently so NormObjects are uniquely identified during transport by
     the concatenation of the sender's session-unique identifier
     (NormNodeId) and the assigned NormObject transport identifier
     (NormTransportId).  The NormTransportIds are assigned from a large
     (32 bit?) numeric space in increasing order and may be reassigned
     for long-lived sessions.  The NORM protocol provides mechanisms so
     that the sender application may terminate transmission of data con-
     tent and inform the group of this in an efficient manner.  Other
     similar protocol control mechanisms (e.g. session termination,
     receiver synchronization, etc) are specified so that reliable mul-
     ticast application variants may construct different, complete bulk
     transfer communication models to meet their goals.

     In summary, the NORM protocol's goal is to provide reliable trans-
     port of  data content objects (including a potentially mixed set of
     types) to the receiver set from one or more senders.  The senders
     will queue and transmit content in the form of static data or files
     and/or non-finite, ongoing stream types.  The sender will provide
     for repair transmission of this content in response to NACK mes-
     sages received from the receiver group.  Mechanisms for "out-of-
     band" information and other session management mechanisms are also
     specified for use by applications to form a complete reliable mul-
     ticast transport solutions for a range different purposes.


2.0 Protocol Definition

2.1 Assumptions

     A NORM protocol instantiation (NormSession) is defined by the con-
     text of participants communicating connectionless (e.g. User Data-
     gram Protocol (UDP)) packets over an Internet Protocol (IP) network
     on a common, pre-determined network address and host port number.
     Generally, the participants exchange packets on an IP multicast
     group address, but unicast transport may also be established or
     applied as an adjunct to multicast delivery. Currently the protocol
     uses a single multicast address for transmissions associated with a
     given NORM session.  However, in the future, it is possible that
     multiple multicast addresses might be employed to segregate sepa-
     rate degrees of repair information to different groups of receivers

     experiencing different packet loss characteristics with respect to
     a given sender.  This capability is under ongoing investigation in
     the research community [REF].  For multicast operation, the NORM
     protocol assumes basic IP multicast forwarding service is available
     at least from the sender(s) to the receiver set.  However, the pro-
     tocol also supports asymmetry where receiver participants may
     transmit back to sender participants via unicast  routing instead
     of broadcasting to the session multicast address.

     Each participant (NormNode) within an NormSession is assumed to
     have an preselected unique 32-bit identifier (NormNodeId).
     NormNodes MUST have uniquely assigned identifiers within a single
     NormSession to distinquish  between possible multiple senders and
     to distinguish feedback information from different receivers.  The
     protocol does not preclude multiple sender nodes actively transmit-
     ting within the context of a single NORM session (i.e. many- to-
     many operation), but any type of interactive coordination among
     these senders is assumed to be controlled by a higher protocol
     layer (perhaps using some of the optional NORM mechanisms later
     specified to perform this coordination).  There are two reserved
     NormNodeId values.  A value of 0x00000000 is considered an invalid
     NormNodeId value and a value of 0xffffffff is a "wildcard"
     NormNodeId.  The "wildcard" NormNodeId value may be useful in cer-
     tain messages when a general response (from all session partici-
     pants) is required by some messages.

     Unique data content transmitted within a NormSession uses sender-
     assigned identifiers (NormObjectTransportIds) which are valid and
     applicable only during  the actual _transport_ of the particular
     portion of data content (i.e. for as long as the sender is trans-
     mitting and providing repair of the indicated data content).  Any
     globally unique identification of transported data content must be
     assigned and processed  by the higher level application using the
     NORM transport service.

2.2 General Protocol Operation

     A NORM sender primarily generates messages of type NORM_DATA  which
     carry the data content and related FEC parity-based repair informa-
     tion for the bulk data/file or stream objects being transferred.
     Parity content is by default sent only in response to receiver
     repair requests (NACKs) and thus normally imposes no additional
     protocol overhead.  However, the transport of an object can be
     optionally configured to proactively transmit some amount of parity
     packets along with the original data content to potentially enhance
     performance (e.g., improved delay) at the cost of additional over-
     head with initial data transmission.  This configuration may be
     sensible for certain network conditions and can allow for robust,

Internet Draft                NORM Protocol                November 2001


     asymmetric multicast (e.g., unidirectional routing, satellite,
     cable) [REF] with minimal receiver feedback, or, in some cases,
     none.  A sender message of type NORM_INFO is also defined and is
     used to carry any optional "out-of-band" context information for a
     given transport object.  Because of its simple, nature content of
     NORM_INFO messages can be NACKed and repaired with a slightly lower
     delay process than NORM's general FEC-encoded data content.
     NORM_INFO may serve special purposes for some buld transfer, reli-
     able multicast applications where receivers join the group mid-
     stream and need to ascertain contextual information on the current
     content being transmitted.  The NACK process for NORM_INFO will be
     described later.

     The sender also generates messages of type NORM_CMD to perform cer-
     tain protocol operations such as congestion control, end-of-trans-
     mission flushing, round trip time estimation, receiver synchroniza-
     tion, and optional positive acknowledgement requests or application
     defined commands.  The transmission of NORM_CMD messages from the
     sender is accomplished by one of three different processes.  These
     include single, best effort unreliable transmission of the command,
     repeated redundant transmission of the command, and positively
     acknowledged commands.  The transmission technique used for a given
     command depends upon the function of the command.  Several core
     commands are defined for basic protocol operation.  Additionally,
     implementations may wish to consider providing the option of appli-
     cation-defined commands which can take advantage of these transmis-
     sion methodologies available for command.  These transmission
     methodologies make use of information available to the protocol
     engine (e.g. round-trip timing, transmission rate, etc) to perform
     efficiently.

     An NORM receiver generates messages of type NORM_NACK or NORM_ACK
     in response to transmissions of data and commands from a sender.
     The NORM_NACK messages are generated to request repair of detected
     data transmission losses.  Receivers generally detect losses by
     tracking the sequence of transmission from a sender.  Sequencing
     information is embedded in the transmitted data packets and end-of-
     transmission commands from the sender.  NORM_ACK messages are gen-
     eratedin response to certain commands transmitted by the sender.
     In the general (and most scalable) protocol mode, receivers do not
     transmit any NORM_ACK messages.  However, in order to meet poten-
     tial user requirements for positive data acknowledgement, and to
     collect more detailed information for potential multicast conges-
     tion control algorithms, NORM_ACK messages are defined and poten-
     tially used.  NORM_ACK messages are also generated by a small sub-
     set of receivers when NORM dynamic end-to-end congestion control is
     in operation.

     NORM allows for reliable transfer of three different types of data
     content.  These include the type NORM_OBJECT_DATA which are static,
     persistent blocks of data content maintained in the sender's appli-
     cation memory storage and the type NORM_OBJECT_FILE which corre-
     sponds to data stored in the sender's non-volatile file system.
     Both of these types represent "NormObjects" of finite size which
     are encapsulated for transmission and are temporarily yet uniquely
     identified with the given sender's NormNodeId and a temporarily
     unique NormObjectTransportId.  The third type of

     All transmissions by individual senders and receivers are subject
     to rate control governed by a peak transmission rate set for each
     participant by the application.  This can be used to limit the
     quantity of multicast data transmitted by the group.  When NORM's
     congestion control algorithm is enabled the rate for senders is
     automatically adjusted.  And even when congestion control is
     enabled, it may be desirable in some cases to establish minimum and
     maximum bounds for the rate adjustment depending upon the applica-
     tion.

2.3 Message Type and Header Definitions

     As mentioned previously, there are two primary classes of NORM mes-
     sages: messages generated by the sender of reliable multicast traf-
     fic and messages generated by receivers.  These are described in
     corresponding sections below after the portion of NORM Message
     header common to all NORM messages is described.

2.3.1 NORM Common Message Header

     There are some common message fields contained in all NORM message
     types.  All NORM protocol messages begin with a common header with
     information fields as follows:


     NORM Common Packet Header

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |    version    |     type      |          sequence             |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                           source_id                           |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

     The "version" field is a 8-bit value indicating the protocol ver-
     sion number.  Currently, NORM implementations SHOULD ignore
     received messages with a different protocol version number. This

     number is intended to indicate and distinguish upgrades of the pro-
     tocol which may be non-interoperable.

     The message "type" field is a 8-bit value indicating the NORM pro-
     tocol message type.  These types are defined as follows:


                               Message     Value

                             NORM_INFO       1
                             NORM_DATA       2
                             NORM_CMD        3
                             NORM_NACK       4
                             NORM_ACK        5
                             NORM_REPORT     6


     The "sequence" field is a 16-bit value which is set by the message
     originator as a monotonically increasing number incremented with
     each NORM message transmitted.  This value can be monitored by
     receiving nodes to detect packet losses in the transmission.  Note
     that this value is NOT used to detect missing reliable data con-
     tent, but is intended for use in an algorithm estimating raw packet
     loss for congestion control purposes.  The size of this field is
     intended to be sufficient to allow detection of a reasonable range
     of packet loss within the expected delay-bandwidth product of
     expected network connections.

     The "source_id" field is a 32-bit value identifying the node which
     sent the message.  A participant's NORM node identifier
     (NormNodeId) can be set according to the application needs but
     unique identifiers must be assigned within a single NormSession.
     In some cases, use of the host IP address or a hash of it can suf-
     fice, but alternative methodologies for assignment and potential
     collision resolution of node identifiers within a multicast session
     need to be considered.  For example, the "source identifier" mecha-
     nism defined in the RTPv2 specification [REF RTP] may be applicable
     to use for NORM node identifiers.  At this point in time, the pro-
     tocol makes no assumptions about how these unique identifiers are
     actually assigned.

     2.3.2 Sender Messages:

     2.3.2.1 NORM_DATA

     This is expected to be the predominant message type transmitted by
     NORM senders.  These messages will contain data content for objects
     of type NORM_OBJECT_DATA, NORM_OBJECT_FILE, and NORM_OBJECT_STREAM.

     A goal of the protocol design is to provide for parallel transmis-
     sion of different streams and data/file sets.  NORM_DATA messages
     will generally consist of original data content of the application
     data being transmitted.  The content size of these messages will a
     maximum of NormSegmentSize which is constant for the duration of a
     given sender's term of participation in the session.  Senders
     advertise their NormSegmentSize in applicable messages which they
     transmit.  This allows receivers to allocate appropriate buffering
     resources and to determine other information in order to properly
     process received data messaging.  Note this message type will also
     be used to convey FEC parity repair content for NormObjects sent.

     these do _not_ represent these values directly.


     The "flags" field contains a number of different binary flags pro-
     viding information and hints regarding how the receiver should han-
     dle the identified object.  Defined flags in this field include:

     The NORM_FLAG_REPAIR flag is set when the associated transmission
     is a repair transmission.  This information can be used by
     receivers to facilitate a join policy where it is desired that
     newly joining receivers only begin participating in the NACK pro-
     cess upon receipt of new "fresh" data.  The NORM_FLAG_INFO flag is
     se only when there optional NORM_INFO content is available for the
     associated object.  Thus, receivers will NACK for retransmission of
     NORM_INFO only when it is available.  The NORM_FLAG_UNRELIABLE flag
     is set when the sender wishes to transmit and object with "best
     effort" delivery only and will not supply repair transmissions for
     the object.  The NORM_FLAG_FILE flag can be set as a "hint" from
     the sender that the associated object should be stored in non-
     volatile storage.  The NORM_FLAG_STREAM flag is set when the iden-
     tified object is of type NORM_OBJECT_STREAM.  Note that the
     "object_size" field is no longer applicable (Another use for this
     field for "stream" objects may be determined as this capability is
     designed).

     The "grtt" field contains a non-linear quantized representation of
     the sender's current estimate of group round-trip time (GRTT).
     This value is used to control timing of the NACK repair process and
     other aspects of protocol operation as described in this document.

     The "gsize" field contains a representation of the sender's current



Adamson, Borman, et al.     Expires May 2002                   [Page 11]

Internet Draft                NORM Protocol                November 2001


     estimate of group size.  This value is to control feedback suppres-
     sion mechanisms within the protocol.  The 8-bit "gsize" field con-
     sists of 4 bits of mantissa in the 4 most significant bits and 4
     bits of base 10 exponent (order of magnitude) information in the 4
     least significant bits.   For example, to represent an approximate
     group size of 100 (or 1e02), the value of the upper 4 bits is 0x01
     (to represent the mantissa of 1) and the lower 4 bits value would
     be 0x02 for an 8-bit representation of "0x12". As another example,
     a group size of 9000 (9e03) would be represented by the value 0x93.
     The group size does not need to be represented with a high degree
     of precision to appropriately scale backoff timers, etc.

     The "fec_id" field corresponds to the FEC Encoding Identifier
     described in the FEC Building Block document (currently "draft-
     ietf-rmt-bb-fec-04.txt").  Note the packet format illustrated above
     assumes "Small Block Systematic Codes" which corresponds to an FEC
     Encoding Identifier equal to 129.  The other "fec" fields may be
     interpreted differently for supporting other FEC Encoding indenti-
     fier types in the future.

     The "segment_size" field indicates the sender's current setting for
     maximum message payload content (in bytes).  The "fec_type" field
     describes the error correction coding technique and parameters the
     sender is using to calculate parity repair segments.  Knowledge of
     these fiels allows a NORM receiver to allocate appropriate buffer-
     ing and FEC decoding resources.

     The "object_size" fields indicate the total size of the object (in
     bytes).  This information is used by receivers to determine storage
     requirements and/or allocate storage for the received object.
     Receivers with insufficient storage capability may wish to forego
     reception (i.e. not NACK for) of the indicated object.  The
     "object_size" fields are not applicable for objects of type
     NORM_OBJECT_STREAM. (Note: The "object_size" fields _may_ be
     defined to serve an alternative use in this case).

     The "fec_encoding_name" and "fec_num_parity" fields correspond to
     the "FEC Encoding Name" and "Number of redundant symbols" fields of
     the FEC Object Transmission Information format given by the FEC
     Building Block document.  The "fec_encoding_name" shall be a value
     corresponding to the particular type of Small Block Systematic Code
     being used (e.g. Reed-Solomon GF(2^8), Reed-Solomon GF(2^16), etc).
     The standardized assignment of these values is TBD.  The
     "fec_num_parity" field corresponds to a parameter for generating
     specific FEC encoding/decoding algorithms for the named code.  For
     example, Reed-Solomon codes may be arbitrarily shortened to create
     different code variations for a given block length.  In this case,
     the "fec_num_parity" value indicates the maximum number of



Adamson, Borman, et al.     Expires May 2002                   [Page 12]

Internet Draft                NORM Protocol                November 2001


     available parity segments for the coding block from the sender.
     This field _may_ be interpreted differently for other systematic
     codes as they are defined.

     The "fec_block_len" corresponds to the number of user data symbols
     in the current FEC coding block for the Small Block Systematic Code
     being used.  Given the "fec_block_len" (Source block length) infor-
     mation of how many symbols of application data is contained in the
     block, the receiver can determine whether the attached segment is
     data or parity content and treat it appropriately.  (For systematic
     codes, symbols numbered 0 through (fec_block_len-1) contain appli-
     cation data while segments numbered (fec_block_len) through
     (fec_block_len+fec_num_parity-1) contain the parity symbols calcu-
     lated for the block).

     The "object_transport_id" field is a monotonically and incremen-
     tally increasing value assigned by a sender to the object being
     transmitted.  Transmissions and repair requests related to that
     object use the same "object_transport_id" value.  For sessions of
     very long or indefinite duration, the "object_transport_id" field
     may be repeated, but it is presumed that the 16-bit field size pro-
     vides an adequate enough sequence space to prevent temporary object
     confusion amongst receivers and sources (i.e. receivers SHOULD re-
     synchronize with a server when receiving object sequence identi-
     fiers sufficiently out-of-range with the current state kept for a
     given source).  During the course of its transmission within a NORM
     session, an object is uniquely identified by the concatenation of
     the sender "node_id" and the given "object_transport_id".  Note
     that NORM_INFO messages associated with the identified object carry
     the same "object_transport_id" value.

     The "fec_block_number" and "fec_symbol_id" fields directly corre-
     spond to the "encoding block number" and "encoding symbol id"
     fields of the FEC Payload ID format given by the FEC Building Block
     document.  The "fec_fec_block_number" identifies the coding block
     while the "fec_symbol_id" identifies which specific symbol (seg-
     ment) within the coding block the attached packet conveys.  Depend-
     ing upon the value of the "fec_symbol_id" and the associated
     "fec_block_len" and "fec_num_parity" parameters for the block, the
     symbol (segment) referenced may be a user data or an FEC parity
     segment.

     Note the concatenation of "object_tranport_id>fec_block_num-
     ber>fec_symbol_id" can be viewed as a transport data unit (TPDU)
     identifier for the attached segment.

     The "offset" and "payload_len" fields are used to identify the
     position and quantity of the content of the packet payload.  For

     senders employing systematic FEC encoding, these fields will corre-
     spond to the actual values for NORM_DATA messages which contain
     original data content.  For NORM_DATA messages containing calcu-
     lated parity content, these fields will actually contain the values
     computed by FEC encoding of the "offset" and "length" values of the
     data segments of the corresponding FEC coding block.  This allows
     the "offset" and "length" values of missing data content to be
     determined when decoding an FEC coding block.

     The "payload_data" field contains original data or computed parity
     content for the identified segment.  The maximum length of this
     field corresponds to the sender's NormSegmentSize.  The length of
     this field for messages containing parity content will always be of
     the length NormSegmentSize.  When encoding a block of data segments
     of varying sizes, the FEC encoder SHALL assume zero value padding
     for data segments less than the NormSegmentSize.  The receiver will
     use the "length" information to properly retrieve receive data con-
     tent and deliver it to the application.


     2.3.2.2 NORM_INFO

     The NORM_INFO message is used to convey _optional_ "out-of-band"
     context information for objects transmitted.  An example may be
     MIME type information for the associated file, data, or stream
     object.  Receivers might use this information to make a decision as
     whether to participate in reliable reception of the associated
     object.  Each NormObject may have an independent unit of NORM_INFO
     associated with it.  NORM_DATA messages contain a flag to indicate
     the availability of NORM_INFO for a given NormObject.  NORM
     receivers may NACK for retransmission of NORM_INFO when they have
     not received it for a given NormObject.  The size of the NORM_INFO
     content is limited to that of a single NormSegmentSize for the
     given sender.  This atomic nature allows the NORM_INFO to be
     rapidly and efficiently repaired within the NORM reliabel transmis-
     sion process.

     "object_transport_id", "object_size", "fec_encoding_name", and
     "fec_num_parity" fields carry the same information and serve the
     same purpose as with NORM_DATA messages.  These values allow the
     receiver to prepare buffering, etc for further transmissions from
     the sender if this is the first message received.  The "pay-
     load_data" field contains application-defined content which can be
     used by the receiver application for various purposes.

     2.3.2.3 NORM_CMD

     NORM_CMD messages are transmitted by senders to perform a number of
     different protocol functions.  This includes round-trip timing col-
     lection, potential congestion control functions, synchronization of
     receiver NACKing "windows", notification of sender status and other
     core protocol functions.  A core set of NORM_CMD messages will be
     enumerated.  A range of command types will remain undefined for
     potential application-specific usage.  Some NORM_CMD types (possi-
     bly including application-defined commands) may have some dynamic
     content attached.  This content will be limited to a single Norm-
     SegmentSize to retain the atomic nature of commands.  The NORM_CMD
     message begins with a common header, following the usual NORM mes-
     sage common header.  The header format is defined as:

     the receiver set for any outstanding repair requests for data up to
     and including the point indicated by the FLUSH message.  The number
     of repeats is equal to ROBUST_FACTOR.  The greater this number, the
     higher the probability that all applicable receivers will be
     excited for repair requests (NACKs) _and_ the corresponding NACKs
     are delivered to the sender.  If a NACK message interrupts the
     flush process, the sender will re-initiate the flush process when
     repair transmissions are completed.  Note that receivers also
     employ a timeout mechanism to self-initiate NACKing when a sender
     is determined to have gone "idle".  This inactivity timeout is
     related to 2*GRTT*ROBUST_FACTOR and will be discussed more later.
     With a sufficient ROBUST_FACTOR value, data content is delivered
     with a high assurance of reliability.  The penalty of a large
     ROBUST_FACTOR value is potentially excess sender NORM_CMD(FLUSH)
     transmissions and a longer timeout for receivers to self-initiate a
     terminal NACK process.  The format of the NORM_CMD(FLUSH) message
     (in addition to the NORM message common header) is:

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

     In addition to the common NORM_CMD "grtt", "gsize", and "flavor"
     fields, the NORM_CMD(FLUSH) message contains fields to identify the
     current logical transmit position of the sender.  These fields con-
     sist of "object_transport_id"., "fec_symbol_id" and "fec_block_num-
     ber".  These fields are interpreted in the same manner as the
     fields of the same names in the NORM_DATA message type.  Receivers
     are expected to check their completion state and initiate the NACK
     repair process if they have outstanding repair needs up through
     this transmission point.  If the receivers have no outstanding
     repair needs, no response is generated.


     NORM_CMD(SQUELCH)

     The NORM_CMD(SQUELCH) command is multicast to the receiver set in
     response to invalid NACKs received by the sender.  Receivers are
     expected to stop (i.e. "squelch") further invalid requests when

     receiving this message.  The NORM_CMD(SQUELCH) command is limited
     to be sent at once per 2*GRTT at the most.  The NORM_CMD(SQUELCH)
     advertises the "repair window" of the sender by identifying the
     earliest (lowest) transmission point for which it will provide
     repair, along with an encoded list of objects from that point for-
     ward which are still valid for repair.  This mechanism allows the
     sender application to abort intermediate objects still in repair
     transmission.  For example, an object pending transmission/repair
     may for some reason may have become obsolete.  The receiver set
     learns from the NORM_CMD(SQUELCH) the set of data for which it is
     valid to request repair.  In normal conditions, it is expected the
     NORM_CMD(SQUELCH) will be used infrequently, and is generally
     anticipated to provide a reference for receivers who have fallen
     "out-of-sync" with the sender.  The NORM_CMD(SQUELCH) contains the
     identity of the earliest transmission point and includes a set of
     NormTransportIds which are valid.  The starting point of the
     included set begins at the greatest (latest) of the sender's earli-
     est transmission point or the lowest invalid NormTransportId in the
     invalid NACK(s) which prompted the generation of the
     NORM_CMD(SQUELCH).  The length of the list in the NORM_CMD(SQUELCH)
     is limited by the sender's NormSegmentSize.  This allows the
     receivers to learn the status of the sender's applicable object
     repair window with minimal transmission of NORM_CMD(SQUELCH) com-
     mands.  The format of the NORM_CMD(SQUELCH) message (in addition to
     the NORM message common header) is:

     A single "flag" value is currently defined:

     NORM_FLUSH_FLAG_EOT = 0x01

     When the NORM_FLUSH_FLAG_EOT is set, it indicates the sender is
     preparing to terminate transmission and no longer provide response
     to repair requests.  This allows the receiver set to gracefully
     reach closure of operation with this sender and free any resources
     which are no longer needed.

     |                        invalid_object_list  ...               |

     In addition to the common NORM_CMD "grtt" and "flavor" fields, the
     NORM_CMD(SQUELCH) message contains fields to identify the earliest
     logical transmit position of the sender's current repair window and
     a "repair window description" beginning with the index of the logi-
     cally earliest invalid repair request from the offending NACK mes-
     sage which initiated the SQUELCH response.

     The "object_transport_id", "fec_block_number", and "fec_symbol_id"
     fields are concatenated to indicate the beginning of the sender's
     current repair window (i.e. the logically earliest point in its
     transmission history for which the sender can provide repair).
     This serves as an advertisement of a "synchronization point" for
     receivers to request repair.  Note, while the "fec_symbol_id" is
     provided here, when FEC is used, the sender's repair window will
     generally be incremented on an FEC coding block basis.

     The "invalid_object_list" is a list of 16-bit object_transport_ids
     which, although they are within the sender's current repair window,
     are no longer available for repair from the sender.  The total size
     of the "invalid_object_list" content is implied by the packets pay-
     load length and is limited to a maximum of the NormSegmentSize of
     the sender.  Thus, for very large repair windows, it is possible
     that a single SQUELCH message may not be capable of completely
     listing the entire set.  In these cases, the sender should ensure
     that the list begins with a "object_transport_id" which is greater
     than the lowest ordinal "object_transport_id" from the NACK message
     for which the SQUELCH is being generated.  This insures convergence
     of the SQUELCH process, even if multiple invalid NACK/ SQUELCH
     response iterations are required.  This explicit description of
     invalid content within the sender's current window, allows the
     sender application (most notably for discrete "object" based trans-
     port) to arbitrarily invalidate (i.e. dequeue) portions of enqueued
     content (e.g. certain objects) for which it no longer wishes to
     provide reliable transport.

     (TBD) Provide example SQUELCH messages.


     NORM_CMD(ACK_REQ)

     The NORM_CMD(ACK_REQ) message is used by the sender to request
     acknowledgement from a specified list of receivers.  This message
     serves in a lightweight positive acknowledgement mechanism which
     can be optionally employed by the reliable multicast application to
     deterministically determine that watermark points in the reliable
     transmission have been achieved by specific receivers.  The format
     of the NORM_CMD(ACK_REQ) message (in addition to the NORM message
     common header) is shown below.

     The NORM_CMD(ACK_REQ) Message consists of "grtt", "gsize", and
     "flavor" fields as with other NORM_CMD messages.  Then an "ack_fla-
     vor" field is specified followed by 64-bits of "ack_flavor" spe-
     cific content and a list of NormNodeIds which are expected to
     explicitly respond to the acknowledgement request.  The "ack_fla-
     vor" field is used to indicate the interpretation of the 64-bit
     ack_req_content" field space following the "ack_flavor" field.  The
     following "ack_flavor" values are defined:

     The NORM_ACK(WATERMARK) identifies a watermark point in the
     sender's reliable transmission and explicitly requests positive
     acknowledgement from  a portion of the receiver set.  So, the for-
     mat of the NORM_CMD(ACK_REQ(WATERMARK)) message (in addition to the
     NORM common message header) is:

     NORM_CMD(ACK_REQ(WATERMARK)) Message

     |                      acking_node_list ...                     |



     The "object_transport_id", "fec_fec_block_number", and "fec_sym-
     bol_id" are used to identify the watermark point for which the pos-
     itive acknowledgement request applies.  This watermark point is
     similar to that used in MDP_CMD(FLUSH) message.  It should be noted
     that all receivers are expected to treat the ACK_REQ command equiv-
     alently to a FLUSH command and appropriately initiate NACK repair
     cycles in response to any detected missing data up to the watermark
     point.

     The "acking_node_list" field contains the current list of receiver
     NormNodeIds which should reply with postive acknowledgement to this
     request.  The packet payload length implies the length of the "ack-
     ing_node_list" and its length is limited to the NormSegmentSize.
     The NormNodeIds are listed in network (Big Endian) order.  The
     indicated receivers SHALL send a NORM_ACK message in response to



Adamson, Borman, et al.     Expires May 2002                   [Page 21]

     this request IF they have no outstanding repair needs up to and
     including the watermark point.  Note this does _not_ necessarily
     mean the receivers actually received all of the data, but simply
     that, for whatever reason (including the fact they may have already
     received the data or if the receiving application simply chose
     _not_ to receive the indicated data), they have no outstanding
     repair needs prior to the watermark point.  Verification of actual
     received data content must be accomplished by another means outside
     of this transport layer protocol.  Receivers SHALL randomly spread
     their response to this request using a uniform distribution over 1
     GRTT of time.  Again, note the size of the included list is limited
     to the sender's NormSegmentSize setting.  Thus, multiple
     NORM_CMD(ACK_REQ) cycles may be required to achieve responses from
     all receivers specified.  Also, the number of attempts to excite a
     response from a given receive SHALL be limited to ROBUST_FACTOR.
     The NORM_CMD(ACK_REQ) is repeated at a rate of once per 2*GRTT.
     Note that the content of the attached NormNodeId list will be
     dynamically updated as this process progresses and ACKs are
     received from the specified receiver set.  The process SHALL termi-
     nate when all desired receivers have responded or the maximum num-
     ber of attempts has been achieved.  Note that repair requests can
     interrupt the positive acknowledgement process and the positive
     acknowledgment process will resume only when there are no pending
     repair transmissions up to the specified watermark point.

     NORM_CMD(ACK_REQ(RTT))

     The NORM_CMD(ACK_REQ(RTT)) is periodically transmitted by the
     sender to provide a reference point (a timestamp) so that receivers
     can calculate appropriate response content in NORM_NACK and
     NORM_ACK messages from which the sender can monitor and estimate
     the current GRTT.  Currently, this reference is sent separately
     from other sender message and not included in every message because
     of the excessive overhead it may impose on data transmission.  Gen-
     erally, the GRTT is not expected to be so dynamic as to require
     rapid update.  However, a technique is being investigated by the
     author to provide a low overhead reference which could be attached
     to every sender transmission and used for the receiver response
     generation [REF].  This command may also potentially be leveraged
     serve as part of NORM congestion control to periodically provide
     updated congestion control information and/or probing to the group.
     If this is the case, there will likely be sufficient content in
     this message that it merits a separate message rather than be peri-
     odically included in the overhead of other sender transmissions.

     This command may also be extended to assume some responsibility in
     initializing and updating a group size estimator used to appropri-
     ately scale NACK suppression back-off timing, etc.  For now, a

     minimal format is defined as a placeholder for this message.  The
     format of the NORM_CMD(GRTT_REQ) message (in addition to the NORM
     message common header and the NORM_CMD common header) is:

     The "send_time" field is a precision timestamp indicating the time
     that the NORM_CMD(GRTT_REQ) message was transmitted.  This consists
     of a 64-bit field containing 32-bits with the time in seconds
     ("sent_time_sec") and 32-bits with the time in microseconds
     ("send_time_usec") since some reference time the source maintains
     (usually 00:00:00, 1 January 1970).  The ordering of the fields in
     Big Endian network order.

     The "acking_node_list" again is a list of NormNodeIds for receivers
     which should explicitly respond to the request. The "wildcard"
     NormNodeId may be listed when a response is expected from all
     receivers.  When this "wildcard" response is elicited, the receiver
     set is expected to randomly spread their response over time, scaled
     as a function of the "grtt" and "gsize" values to avoid response
     implosion.  The receivers corresponding to other listed specific
     NormNodeIds are expected to respond immediately with an appropriate
     NORM_ACK message (unless a NORM_NACK message is already queued for
     response).  Both NORM_NACK and NORM_ACK messages are designed to
     contain information to allow the sender to determine round trip
     times for responding receivers.

     NORM_CMD(REPAIR_ADV)

     The NORM_CMD(REPAIR_ADV) message is used by the sender to "adver-
     tise" its aggregated repair state from accumulated NORM_NACK mes-
     sages during repair cycles.  This message is sent only when the
     sender has received some NORM_NACK messages via unicast transmis-
     sion instead of multicast.  By "advertising" its repair state to
     the receiver set, suppression of reliable multicast feedback can be
     achieved even when receivers are unicasting that feedback instead
     of multicasting it among the group.  [REF]

     The "grtt", "gsize" and "flavor" fields serve the same purpose as
     in other NORM_CMD messages.

     There is one flag defined:

     NORM_REPAIR_ADV_FLAG_LIMIT = 0x01

     This flag is set by the sender when it is unable to fits its full
     current repair state into a single NormSegmentSize.  If this flag
     is set, receivers should limit their NACKing to generating NACKs
     only up through the maximum transmission position included in the
     "repair_adv_content".

     The "repair_adv_content" is in exactly the same form as the
     "nack_content" of NORM_NACK messages and can be processed by
     receivers for suppression purposes in the same manner with the
     exception of the condition when the NORM_REPAIR_ADV_FLAG_LIMIT is
     set.


     NORM_CMD(CC)

     The NORM_CMD(CC) message is a sender message which may be applica-
     ble when congestion control mechanism are applied to NORM protocol
     operation.  It is expected that the NORM_CMD(CC) will contain
     fields to enable sender->receiver set round-trip time collection.
     Additional candidate fields for this message include congestion
     control parameters such as "tx_rate", "rtt", "loss", etc for
     assisting a congestion control mechanism appropiate for NORM.
     Also, a list of "congestion control representatives" (or candi-
     dates) may be provided, possibly each given with information so
     that the "congestion control candidates" may determine their own

     NORM_CMD(APPLICATION)

     This command allows the NORM application to robustly transmit
     application defined content.  The message preempts any ongoing data
     transmission and is repeated ROBUST_FACTOR times at a rate of once
     per 2*GRTT.  This rate of repeat allows the application to collect
     a response (if that is the application's purpose for the command)
     before it is repeated.  Regular data object transmission is resumed
     when the repeated transmission of this message has completed.  This
     command allows NORM applications to have a robust simple communica-
     tion with less state than the transfer of FEC encoded reliable con-
     tent requires.

     2.3.3 Receiver Messages:

     2.3.3.1 NORM_NACK

     The principal purpose of NORM_NACK messages will be for receivers
     to request repair of content via negative acknowledgement upon
     detection of incomplete data.  NORM_NACKs will be transmitted
     according to the rules of NACK generation and suppression of the
     NORM NACK process.  A goal for the content of these messages is to
     use a format which can be potentially used by compatible intermedi-
     ate systems [REF Generic Router Assist Building Block] to provide

     assistance in promoting protocol scalability and efficiency when
     available.  NORM_NACK messages generated will also contain addi-
     tional content to provide feedback to sender(s) for purposes of
     round-trip timing collection, congestion control, etc.

     NORM_NACK messages are transmitted by NORM receivers in response to
     the detection of missing data in the sequence of transmissions
     received from a particular source.  The specific times and condi-
     tions under which receivers will generate and transmit these
     NORM_NACK messages are governed by the processes described in
     detail later in this document.  The payload of NORM_NACK messages
     contains one or more "ObjectNACKs" for different objects and por-
     tions of those objects.  In addition to the common message header
     the NORM_NACK messages contain the following fields:

     The "server_id" field identifies the source to which the NORM_NACK
     message is destined.  Other sources should ignore this message.
     (Note that this another  reason why multiple potential sources
     within an NORM session MUST have unique  NormNodeIds).

     The "grtt_response" fields contain a timestamp indicating the time
     at which the NORM_NACK was transmitted.  The format of this times-
     tamp is the same as the  "send_time" field of the
     NORM_CMD(ACK_REQ(RTT)).  However, note that the  "grtt_response"
     timestamp is _relative_ to the "send_time" the source provided
     with the corresponding NORM_CMD(ACK_REQ(RTT)) command.  The
     receiver adjusts the  source's NORM_CMD(ACK_REQ(RTT)) "send_time"
     timestamp by the time differential from  when the receiver received
     the NORM_CMD(ACK_REQ(RTT)) to when the NORM_NACK was  transmitted
     to calculate the value in the "grtt_response" field.  This is the
     "receive_to_response_differential" value in he following formula:

     "grtt_response" = request "send_time" + receive_to_response_differential



Adamson, Borman, et al.     Expires May 2002                   [Page 26]

Internet Draft                NORM Protocol                November 2001


     The receiver may set the "grtt_response" to a ZERO value, to indi-
     cate that the it has not yet received a NORM_CMD(ACK_REQ(RTT)) com-
     mand from the source and the source should ignore the grtt_response
     in this message.

     The "loss_estimate" field is the receiver's current packet loss
     fraction estimate for the indicated source.  The loss fraction is a
     value from 0.0 to 1.0 corresponding to a range of zero to 100 per-
     cent packet loss. The 16-bit "loss_estimate" value is calculated by
     the following formula:

              "loss_estimate" = decimal_loss_fraction * 65535.0

     The "grtt_req_sequence" field contains the loss sequence number
     identifier of the received NORM_CMD(ACK_REQ(RTT)) to which the
     response information in this NORM_NACK applies.  This sequence num-
     ber is the one from the NORM common message header for the applica-
     ble NORM_CMD(ACK_REQ(RTT)) command.  This information can possibly
     assist the sender in congestion control operation.

     The "nack_content" of the NORM_NACK message specifies the repair
     needs of this client pertaining to the indicated "server_id".  The
     repair needs are specified as one or more lists of individual
     "items", "ranges", and/or FEC coding block "erasure_counts" of
     identified NORM_DATA and/or NORM_INFO messages required for the
     receiver to complete reliable reception of objects being transmit-
     ted by the sender.

     Each list of "items", "ranges", or "erasure_counts" is specified
     with the following packet format:

      0                   1                   2                   3

     The "form" field indicates currently whether the NACK content that
     follows is a list of NORM_NACK_ITEMS, NORM_NACK_RANGES, or
     NORM_NACK_ERASURES.  Possible values for the "form" field include:

Internet Draft                NORM Protocol                November 2001


                                Form          Value
                         NORM_NACK_ITEMS        1

                         NORM_NACK_ERASURES     3


     When the list consists of individual NORM_NACK_ITEMS, each concate-
     nation of "object_transport_id>fec_block_number>fec_symbol_id"
     identifies an individual repair need of the NACKing receiver.  When
     the list consists of NORM_NACK_RANGES, pairs of "object_trans-
     port_id>fec_block_number>fec_symbol_id" sets are given to indicate
     the inclusive range of sender information needed by the receiver.
     When the list consists of NORM_NACK_ERASURES, each "object_trans-
     port_id>fec_block_number>erasure_count" concatenation listed  indi-
     cates the receiver's FEC erasure count for the identified object
     and FEC encoding block.

     The "flags" field is currently used to indicate if the NACK content
     applies to NORM_DATA content, NORM_INFO content, or both.  Thus,
     defined flags in this field include:


    +------------------+-------+------------------------------------------+
    |      Flag        | Value |                 Purpose                  |
    +------------------+-------+------------------------------------------+
    |NORM_NACK_SEGMENT | 0x01  | Indicates the listed segment(s) are      |
    |                  |       | required as repair.                      |
    +------------------+-------+------------------------------------------+
    |NORM_NACK_BLOCK   | 0x02  | Indicates the entire listed block(s) are |
    |                  |       | required as repair.                      |
    +------------------+-------+------------------------------------------+
    |NORM_NACK_INFO    | 0x04  | Indicates the object's NORM_INFO is      |
    |                  |       | required as repair.                      |
    +------------------+-------+------------------------------------------+
    |NORM_NACK_OBJECT  | 0x08  | Indicates the entire listed object(s)    |
    |                  |       | are required as repair.                  |
    +------------------+-------+------------------------------------------+

     When the NORM_FLAG_SEGMENT flag is set, the "object_transport_id",
     "fec_block_number" and "fec_symbol_id" fields are concatenated to
     determine which sets or ranges of individual NORM_DATA segments are
     needed to repair data at this receiver.  When the NORM_FLAG_BLOCK
     flag is set, this indicates the receiver is completely missing the
     indicated coding block(s) and requires transmissions sufficient to
     repair the block(s) in entirety.  In this case the "fec_symbol_id"
     fields are ignored.  When the NORM_NACK_INFO flag is set, this
     indicates the receiver is missing the NORM_INFO segment for the
     indicated "object_transport_id".  Note the NORM_NACK_INFO may be

     set in combination with the NORM_NACK_BLOCK or NORM_NACK_SEGMENT
     flags, or may be set alone.  When the NORM_NACK_OBJECT flag is set,
     this indicates the receiver is missing the entire NormTransportOb-
     ject referenced by the "object_transport_id".  This implicitly
     includes any available NORM_INFO if applicable.  The
     "fec_block_number" and "fec_symbol_id" fields are ignored when this
     flag is set.

     The "length" field is given (in bytes) to indicate the length of
     the list of NORM_NACK_ITEMS or NORM_NACK_RANGES.  Multiple lists of
     NACK items and/or ranges may be concatenated together within a sin-
     gle NORM_NACK message.

     NACK Content Examples:

     In Example 1, a list of individual NORM_NACK_ITEMS is given.  In
     Example 2, a list of NORM_NACK_RANGES _and_ a list of a single
     NORM_NACK_ITEM are concatenated to illustrate the possible content
     of a NORM_NACK message.  Note that FEC coding block erasure counts
     are provided in each case.

     2.3.3.2 NORM_ACK

     The basic operation of NORM transport will _not_ rely on the use
     NORM_ACK (positive acknowledgement) messages.  However, some appli-
     cations may benefit from some limited form of positive acknowledge-
     ment for certain functions.  A simple, scalable positive acknowl-
     edgement scheme is defined which can be leveraged by protocol
     implementations when appropriate.

     The "server_id", "grtt_response_sec", "grtt_response_usec",
     "loss_estimate", and "grtt_req_sequence" fields serve the same pur-
     pose as the corresponding fields in NORM_NACK messages.


     The "ack_flavor" field indicates the nature of the following ACK
     content.  This directly corresponds to the "ack_flavor" field of
     the NORM_CMD(ACK_REQ) message.  For example, if the sender has
     requested explicit positive acknowledgement of reception of a
     watermark "object_transport_id" and "fec_block_number", the
     receiver will respond with "ack_flavor=NORM_ACK(WATERMARK) and
     appopriately valued "object_transport_id" and "fec_block_number"
     fields.  If the NORM_ACK is simply a response to an explicit
     NORM_CMD(GRTT_REQ), the "ack_flavor" is set to NORM_ACK(RTT) and
     there is _no_ ACK content.  (The length of the content may be
     inferred from the NORM_ACK packet payload size).

     The "object_transport_id", "fec_block_number", and "fec_symbol_id"

     field.

     The NORM_ACK(RTT) message has no attached content.  Only the
     NORM_ACK header applies.

     Since it may be useful for applications to leverage the NORM posi-
     tive acknowledgement mechanism for other purposes, additional
     NORM_ACK "ack_flavors" may be used by the application for other
     purposes.  The content of the NORM_ACK message (past the NORM_ACK
     header "reserved" field) for application-defined "ack_flavor" val-
     ues, is specific to the application but is limited is size to the
     NormSegmentSize of the sender referenced by the "server_id".

     2.3.4 General Messages:

     2.3.4.1 NORM_REPORT

     This is an optional message generated by NORM participants.  This
     message may include periodic performance reports from receivers.
     Additionally, this message type may be potentially used by applica-
     tions to perform other session management functions such as period-
     ically advertising the full identity of a participant or the gen-
     eral context (more general than NORM_INFO messages which are asso-
     ciated with specific data content objects) of the content being
     transmitted to the group by a sender.

3.0 Detailed Protocol Operation

     This section describes the detailed interactions of senders and
     receivers participating in a NORM session.  A simple synopsis of
     protocol operation is given in the following items.

     1) The sender periodically transmits NORM_CMD(ACK_REQ(RTT)) mes-
     sages and/or NORM_CMD(CC) messages as needed to initialize and col-
     lect roundtrip timing and congestion control feedback from the
     receiver set.

     2) The sender transmits an ordinal set of NormObjects in the form
     of NORM_DATA (and optional NORM_INFO) messages labelled with Nor-
     mObjectTransportIds and logically identified with FEC encoding
     block numbers and symbol identifiers.

     3) As receivers detect missing content from the receiver, they ini-
     tiate repair requests with NORM_NACK messages.  Note the receivers
     track the sender's most recent "object_transport_id>fec_block_num-
     ber>fec_symbol_id" transmit position and NACK _only_ for content
     ordinally prior to that transmit position.  The receivers use ran-
     dom backoff timeouts before generating NORM_NACK messages and wait
     an appropriate amount of time before repeating the NORM_NACK if
     their repair request is not satisified.

Internet Draft                NORM Protocol                November 2001


     4) The sender aggregates repair requests from the receiver set and
     "rewinds" to send appropriate repair messages.  The sender sends
     repairs for the earliest ordinal transmit position first and main-
     tains this ordinal repair transmission sequence.  Previously
     untransmitted FEC parity content for the applicable FEC coding
     block is used for repair transmissions to the greatest extent pos-
     sible.  If the sender exhausts its available FEC parity content on
     multiple repair cycles for the same coding block, it resorts to an
     explicit repair strategy (again using parity content) to complete
     repairs.  (The use of explicit repair is expected to be an excep-
     tion in general protocol operation, but the possibility does
     exist).  The sender immediately assumes transmission of new content
     once it has sent pending repair transmissions.

     5) The sender transmits NORM_CMD(FLUSH) messages when it reaches
     the end of newly available transmit content.  Receivers respond to
     the NORM_CMD(FLUSH) messages with NORM_NACK transmissions (follow-
     ing the same suppression backoff timeout strategy as for data).

     6) The sender transmission rate is subject to rate control limits
     determined by congestion control.  Each sender in a NormSession
     maintains its own independent congestion control state.

     While the overall concept of the protocol is relatively simple,
     there are details to each of these aspects which need to be
     addressed for successful, robust, and scalable operation.

3.1 Sender Initialization and Transmission

     (TBD) Describes how a sender becomes active within the group,
     transmits data content and how it may potentially go inactive or
     leave the group.

3.2 Receiver Initialization and Reception

     (TBD) Describes how a receiver joins the group, begins receiving
     data content and any requirements on dynamically leaving and poten-
     tially rejoining the group. Different receiver join "policies" may
     be appropriate for different applications and/or scenarios.

3.3 Receiver NACK Procedure

     When the receiver detects it is missing data from a sender's stream
     of reliable transmissions, it initiates its NACKing procedure.  The
     NACKing procedure SHALL be initiated _only_ at NormObject bound-
     aries, FEC coding block boundaries, or upon receipt of a
     NORM_CMD(FLUSH) or NORM_CMD(ACK_REQ(WATERMARK)) message.




Adamson, Borman, et al.     Expires May 2002                   [Page 33]

Internet Draft                NORM Protocol                November 2001


     The NACKing procedure begins with a random backoff timeout.  The
     duration of the backoff timeout is chosen using the "RandomBackoff"
     technique described in the NORM Building Block document (currently
     "draft-ietf-rmt-bb-norm-03.txt") using (N*GRTTsender) for the "max-
     Time" parameter and the sender advertised group size (GSIZEsender)
     as the "groupSize" parameter.

     During this backoff time, the receiver accumulates external pending
     repair state from NORM_NACK messages and NORM_CMD(REPAIR_ADV) mes-
     sages received.  At the end of the backoff time, the receiver SHALL
     generate a NORM_NACK message only if the following conditions are
     met:

     1)  The sender's current transmit position (in terms of
     "object_transport_id>fec_block_number>fec_symbol_id" exceeds the
     earliest repair position of the receiver.

     2)  The repair state accumulated from NORM_NACK and
     NORM_CMD(REPAIR_ADV) messages do not equal or supersede the
     receiver's repair needs.

     If these conditions are met, the receiver immediately generates a
     NORM_NACK message when the backoff timeout expires.

     The content of the NORM_NACK message contains NACK content begin-
     ning with lowest ordinal repair position for the receiver up to the
     most recently heard ordinal transmission position for the sender.
     If size of the NACK content exceeds the NormSegmentSize, the NACK
     content is limited to that point so that the receiver only gener-
     ates a single NORM_NACK message per NACK cycle for a given sender.

     For each FEC coding block requiring repair, the receiver MUST, on
     the _first_ repair cycle for the block, request the parity portion
     of the FEC coding block beginning with the lowest ordinal _parity_
     "fec_symbol_id" and request the number of symbols corresponding to
     its erasure count for the block.  On _subsequent_ repair cycles for
     the same coding block, the receiver MUST request only those parity
     repair symbols from the first set it has not yet received up to the
     remaining erasure count for that applicable coding block.  (Note
     that the sender may have provided other additional parity segments
     for other receivers which can also be used to satisfy the local
     receiver's erasure-filling needs).  The goal of this strategy is
     for the overall receiver set to request a lowest common denominator
     set of repair symbols for a given FEC coding block.  This allows
     the sender to construct the most efficient repair transmission seg-
     ment set and enables effective NACK suppression among the receivers
     even with uncorrelated packet loss.

3.4 Sender NACK Processing and Repair Transmission

     3.4.1 NORM_NACK Repair State Aggregation

     The principle goal of the sender is to make forward progress in the
     transmission of data its application has enqueued.  However, the
     sender must occasionally "rewind" to satisfy the repair needs of
     receivers who have NACKed.  When a sender is in its normal state of
     transmitting new data and receives a NACK, it begins a procedure to
     accumulate NACK repair state from NORM_NACK messages before begin-
     ning repair transmissions.  Note that this period of aggregating
     repair state does _not_ interfere with its ongoing transmission of
     new data.

     The period of time during which the sender aggregates NORM_NACK
     messages is equal to (N+1)*GRTT where "N" is the same backoff scal-
     ing window used by the receivers and "GRTT" is the sender's current
     estimate of the group's greatest round-trip time.  When this period
     ends, the sender "rewinds" by incorporating the accumulated repair
     state into its pending transmission state and begins transmitting
     repair messages and then continues with transmission of any
     enqueued data.  If additional NORM_NACK messages are received after
     repair transmissions begin, the sender will immediately incorporate
     these into its pending transmission state ONLY if the NACK content
     is ordinally greater than the sender's current transmission posi-
     tion.  Otherwise, a new NACK accumulation period is begun in con-
     cert with the pending repair and new data transmission.  The sender
     repeats the same process of incorporating accumulated repair state
     into its transmission plan and "rewinds" to transmit the lowest
     ordinal repair data.

     3.4.2 FEC Repair Transmission Strategy

     The NORM sender should leverage transmission of FEC parity content
     for repair to the greatest extent possible.  Recall that the
     receivers' use a strategy to request a lowest common denominator of
     explicit repair (including parity content) in the formation of
     their NORM_NACK messages.  Before falling back to explicitly satis-
     fying all of the different receivers' repair needs, the sender can
     make use of the general erasure filling capability of FEC-generated
     parity segments.  The sender can determine the maximum erasure
     filling needs for individual FEC coding blocks from the NORM_NACK
     messages received during the repair aggregation period.  Then, if
     the sender has a sufficient number (less than or equal to the maxi-
     mum erasure count) of previously unsent parity segments available
     for the applicable coding blocks, the sender can transmit these in
     lieu of the specific packets the receiver set has requested.  Only
     after exhausting its supply of "fresh" (unsent) parity segments for



Adamson, Borman, et al.     Expires May 2002                   [Page 35]

Internet Draft                NORM Protocol                November 2001


     a given coding block should the sender resort to explicit transmis-
     sion of the receiver set's repair needs.  In general, if a suffi-
     ciently powerful FEC code is used, the need for explicit repair
     will be an exception, and the fulfillment of reliable multicast can
     be accomplished quite efficiently.  However, the ability to resort
     to explicit repair allows the protocol to be reliable under even
     very extreme circumstances.

     NORM_DATA messages sent as repair transmissions are flagged with
     the NORM_FLAG_REPAIR flag.  This allows receivers to obey any poli-
     cies which limit new receivers from joining the reliable transmis-
     sion on repair transmissions.

     To facilitate operation with Generic Router Assist (GRA), the
     sender can additionally flag NORM_DATA transmissions sent as
     explicit repair with the NORM_FLAG_EXPLICIT flag.  The GRA router
     needs to only subcast a sufficient count of non-explicit parity
     repairs to satisfy the sub-tree's erasure filling needs for a given
     FEC coding block.  When the sender has resorted to explicit repair,
     the GRA router will subcast all of the explicit repair packets to
     those portions of the routing tree still requiring repair for a
     given coding block.  (Note the GRA router will be required to con-
     duct repair state accumulation for sub-routes in a manner similar
     to the sender's repair state accumulation in order to have suffi-
     cient information to perform the subcasting.  Additionally, the GRA
     router can perform additional NORM_NACK suppression/aggregation as
     it conducts this repair state accumulation for NORM repair cycles).

     3.4.3 NORM_CMD(SQUELCH) Generation

     If the sender receives a NORM_NACK message for repair of data it is
     no longer supporting, the sender generates a NORM_CMD(SQUELCH) mes-
     sage to advertise its repair window and squelch any receivers from
     additional NACKing of invalid data.  The transmission rate of
     NORM_CMD(SQUELCH) messages is limited to once per 2*GRTT.  The
     "invalid_object_list" (if applicable) of the NORM_CMD(SQUELCH) mes-
     sage SHALL begin with the lowest "object_transport_id" from the set
     of NORM_NACKs for invalid data received since the last
     NORM_CMD(SQUELCH) transmission.  Lower ordinal invalid
     "object_transport_ids" should be included only while the
     NORM_CMD(SQUELCH) payload is less than the sender's NormSegmentSize
     parameter.

     3.4.4 NORM_CMD(REPAIR_ADV) Generation

     When a NORM sender receives NORM_NACK messages from receivers via
     unicast transmission, it uses NORM_CMD(REPAIR_ADV) messages to
     advertise its accumulated repair state to the receiver set since



Adamson, Borman, et al.     Expires May 2002                   [Page 36]

Internet Draft                NORM Protocol                November 2001


     the receiver set is not communicating this with each other via mul-
     ticast communication.  The NORM_CMD(REPAIR_ADV) message is multi-
     cast to the receiver set.  The content of this message is in the
     same format as NORM_NACK messages and receivers are able to process
     these messages in a similar manner that NORM_NACKs from other
     receivers are processed to facilitate feedback suppression.  Note
     the sender does not merely retransmit the NACK content it receives,
     but instead transmits a representation of its aggregated repair
     state.  The transmission of NORM_CMD(REPAIR_ADV) messages are sub-
     ject to the sender transmit rate limit and NormSegmentSize limit.
     When the NORM_CMD(REPAIR_ADV) message is of maximum size, receivers
     should also consider the maximum ordinal transmission position
     value embedded in the the message as the senders "current" trans-
     mission position and not NACK for ordinally higher repairs.

3.5 Additional Protocol Mechanisms

     3.5.1 Round-trip time collection

     For NORM receivers to appropriately scale backoff timeouts and the
     senders to use proper corresponding timeouts, the participants must
     agree on a common time base.  Each NORM sender monitors the round-
     trip time of active receivers and determines the greatest round-
     trip time of the group (GRTT).  The sender advertises this GRTT
     estimate in every message it transmits so that receivers have this
     time available.  The sender periodically sends
     NORM_CMD(ACK_REQ(RTT)) messages which contain a locally generated
     timestamp.  Receivers are expected to record this timestamp along
     with the time the NORM_CMD(ACK_REQ(RTT)) is received.  Then, when
     the receivers generate feedback messages to the sender, an adjusted
     version of the sender timestamp is embedded in the feedback message
     (NORM_NACK or NORM_ACK).  The adjustment adds the amount of time
     the receiver held the timestamp before generating its response.
     From this adjusted timestamp, the sender is able to calculate the
     round-trip time to that receiver.

     The round-trip time for each receiver is fed into an algorithm
     which weights and smooths the values for a conservative estimate of
     the GRTT.  The algorithm and methodology is described in the NORM
     Building Block document (currently "draft-ietf-rmt-bb-norm-03.txt")
     in section 3.7.1 "One-to-Many Sender GRTT Measurement".  A conser-
     vative estimate helps feedback suppression at a small cost in over-
     all protocol repair delay.  The sender's current estimate of GRTT
     is advertised in the "grtt" field found in all NORM sender mes-
     sages.  The advertised GRTT is also limited to be at least as big
     as the nominal inter-packet transmission time given the sender's
     current transmission rate.  The reason for this additional limit is
     to keep the receiver somewhat "event driven" by making sure the



Adamson, Borman, et al.     Expires May 2002                   [Page 37]

Internet Draft                NORM Protocol                November 2001


     sender has had adequate time to generate any response to repair
     requests from receivers given transmit rate limitations due to con-
     gestion control or configuration.

     Typically, the "acking_node_list" of the NORM_CMD(ACK_REQ(RTT))
     message may be empty with only NORM_NACK feedback messages supply-
     ing adjusted timestamps to the sender for processing.  However, it
     may be useful for a session initialization period to explicitly
     collect feedback from all receivers.  In this case the "ack-
     ing_node_list" can contain the "wildcard" NormNodeId value and/or a
     specific list of receivers to provide GRTT feedback.

     Note the round-trip values collected with this mechanism _may_ be
     useful for congestion control operation.  However, it is possible
     that congestion control may require receivers to determine their
     round-trip time with respect to the sender and additional mecha-
     nisms may be provided with the NORM_CMD(CC) message.

     3.5.2 Group Size Estimation

     (TBD) Group size can be approximated from the density of feedback
     messages which follow the exponentially weighted random backoff.
     NORM_NACK messages might be used during normal protocol operation
     or a bootstrap procedure can be created to obtain an initial size
     estimation and track group size with receiver join/leave dynamics.
     This might also be combined with congestion control feedback col-
     lection.  The details of this are TBD.

     3.5.3 Congestion control operation

     (TBD)

     3.5.4 Positive Acknowledgment Procedure

     NORM provides an option for the source application to request posi-
     tive acknowledgment (ACK) of a reliable reception of watermark
     points of transmission or other events from a subset of receivers
     in the group.  A simple robust polling procedure is used.  This
     polling procedure is not intended to scale to very large receiver
     subsets.  The list of receivers providing acknowledgement is deter-
     mined by the source application with "a priori" knowledge of par-
     ticipating nodes or via some other application-level mechanism.
     The "ack_flavor" of NORM_ACK(WATERMARK) (value = 1) is predefined
     for the sender to request positive acknowledgement of reliable
     reception to a watermark transmission point.  The "ack_flavor" of
     NORM_ACK(RTT) (value = 2) is also defined for explicit round-trip
     timing collection as described above.  It is possible that addi-
     tional "ack_flavor" values may be application-dependent so that

Internet Draft                NORM Protocol                November 2001


     applications (or other protocols utilizing NORM mechanisms) may
     leverage NORM's built-in positive acknowledgement collection mecha-
     nism.

     The ACK process is initiated by the sender who generates
     NORM_CMD(ACK_REQ) messages in periodic "rounds".  For
     NORM_ACK(WATERMARK), these requests contain the "object_trans-
     port_id" and "fec_block_number>fec_symbol_id" denoting the water-
     mark transmission point.

     The ACK process is self-limiting and avoids ACK implosion in that:

       1)   Only a single NORM_CMD(ACK_REQ) message is generated once
            per (2*GRTT), and

       2)   The size of the "acking_node_list" of NormNodeIds from which
            ACK is requested is limited to a maximum of the sender Norm-
            SegmentSize setting per round of the positive acknowledge-
            ment process.

     The indicated receivers randomly spread their NORM_ACK responses
     uniformly in time over a window of (1*GRTT).  As the source
     receives responses from receivers, it eliminates them from the mes-
     sage payload list and adds in pending receiver NormNodeIds keeping
     within the NormSegmentSize limitation of the list size.  Each
     receiver is only queried for a maximum number of repeats
     (ROBUST_FACTOR, by default).  Any receivers not responding within
     this number of repeated requests are removed from the payload list
     to make potential room for other receivers pending acknowledgement.
     The transmission of the NORM_CMD(ACK_REQ) is repeated  until no
     further responses are required or until the repeat threshold is
     exceeded for all pending receivers.  Note the positive acknowledg-
     ment process may be interrupted in response to negative acknowl-
     edgement repair requests (NACKs) received from receivers during the
     acknowledgment period.  The ACK process is resumed once any pending
     repairs have been transmitted.  Note that receivers will not ACK
     until they have received complete transmission of all data up to
     and including the watermark transmission point indicated in the
     NORM_CMD(ACK_REQ) message from the sender.  Receivers will respond
     to the request with a NACK message if any repairs are required.

     3.5.5 Operation with Generic Router Assist (GRA)

     NORM packet formats will be extended to allow for operation with
     GRA reliable multicast functions.  Additional NACK suppression and

     nisms related to this).  Additional details will be provide in

4.0 Security Considerations

     (TBD)

5.0 Suggested Use

     The present NORM protocol is seen as useful tool for the  reliable
     data transfer over generic IP multicast  services.  It is not the
     intention of the authors to suggest it is suitable for  supporting
     all envisioned multicast reliability requirements.  NORM provides a
     simple and flexible framework for multicast applications with a
     degree of concern for network traffic implosion and protocol over-
     head efficiency.  NORM-like protocols have been successfully demon-
     strated within the MBone for bulk data dissemination applications,
     including weather satellite compressed imagery updates servicing a
     large group of receivers and a generic web content reliable "push"
     application.

     In addition, this framework approach has some design features mak-
     ing it attractive for bulk transfer in asymmetric and wireless
     internetwork  applications.  NORM is capable of successfully oper-
     ating independent of network structure and in environments with
     high packet loss, delay, and misordering.  Hybrid proactive/reac-
     tive FEC-based repairing improve protocol performance in some mul-
     ticast scenarios.  A sender-only repair approach often makes addi-
     tional engineering sense in asymmetric networks.  NORM's unicast
     feedback capability may be suitable for use in asymmetric networks
     or in networks where only unidirectional multicast routing/delivery
     service exists. Asymmetric architectures supporting multicast
     delivery are likely to make up an important portion of the future
     Internet structure (e.g., DBS/cable/PSTN hybrids) and efficient,
     reliable bulk data transfer will be an important capability for
     servicing large groups of subscribed receivers.
