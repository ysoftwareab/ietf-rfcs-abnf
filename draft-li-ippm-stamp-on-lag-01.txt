                     draft-li-ippm-stamp-on-lag-01

Abstract

   This document extends Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol
   (STAMP) to implement performance measurement on every member link of
   a Link Aggregation Group (LAG).  Knowing the measured metrics of each
   member link of a LAG enables operators to enforce a performance based
   traffic steering policy across the member links.

1.  Introduction

   Link Aggregation Group (LAG), as defined in [IEEE802.1AX], provides
   mechanisms to combine multiple physical links into a single logical
   link.  This logical link offers higher bandwidth and better
   resiliency, because if one of the physical member links fails, the
   aggregate logical link can continue to forward traffic over the
   remaining operational physical member links.

   Usually, when forwarding traffic over LAG, the hash-based mechanism
   is used to load balance the traffic across the LAG member links.
   Link delay of each member link varies because of different transport
   paths.  To provide low latency service for time sensitive traffic, we
   need to explicitly steer the traffic across the LAG member links
   based on the link delay, loss and so on.  That requires a solution to
   measure the performance metrics of each member link of a LAG.

Internet-Draft               STAMP PM on LAG                January 2022


   Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) [RFC8762] is an
   active measurement method according to the classification given in
   RFC7799 [RFC7799].  It provides a mechanism to measure both one-way
   and round-trip performance metrics, like delay, delay variation, and
   packet loss.  Running a single STAMP test session over the
   aggregation without the knowledge of each member link would make it
   impossible to measure the performance of a given physical member
   link.  The measured metrics can only reflect the performance of one
   member link or an average of some/all member links of the LAG.

   This document extends STAMP to implement performance measurement on
   every member link of a LAG.  The proposed method could also
   potentially apply to layer 3 ECMP (Equal Cost Multi-Path), e.g., with
   SR-Policy [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].

2.  Micro Session on LAG

   This document intends to address the scenario (e.g., Figure 1) where
   a LAG (e.g., the LAG includes three member links) directly connects
   two nodes (A and B) . The goal is to measure the performance of each
   link of the LAG.

                     +---+                       +---+
                     |   |-----------------------|   |
                     | A |-----------------------| B |
                     |   |-----------------------|   |
                     |   |-----------------------|   |
                     +---+                       +---+

                           Figure 1: PM for LAG

   To measure the performance metrics of every member link of a LAG,
   multiple sessions (one session for each member link) need to be
   established between the two end points that are connected by the LAG.
   These sessions are called micro sessions in the remainder of this
   document.

   All micro sessions of a LAG share the same Sender IP Address and
   Receiver IP Address.  As for the UDP Port, the micro sessions may
   share the same Sender Port and Receiver Port pair, or each micro
   session is configured with a different Sender Port and Receiver Port
   pair.  But from the operational point of view, the former is simpler
   and is recommended.

   At the Sender side, each micro STAMP session MUST be assgined with a
   unique SSID [RFC8972].  Both the micro STAMP Session Sender and
   Reflector MUST use SSID to correlate the Test packet to a micro

   session.  If there is no such a session, or the SSID is not correct,
   the Test packet MUST be discarded.

   Test packets MAY carry the member link information for validation
   check.  For example, when a micro STAMP Session-Sender receives a
   reflected Test packet, it may need to check whether the Test packet
   is from the expected member link.  The detailed description about the
   member link validation is in section 3.

   A micro STAMP Session-Sender MAY include the Follow-Up Telemetry TLV
   [RFC8972] to request information from the micro Session-Reflector.
   This timestamp might be important for the micro Session-Sender, as it
   improves the accuracy of network delay measurement by minimizing the
   impact of egress queuing delays on the measurement.

3.  Member Link Validation

   Test packets MAY carry the member link information for validation
   check.  The micro Session Sender can verify whether the test packet
   is reveived from the expected member link.  It can also verify
   whether the packet is sent from the expected member link at the
   Reflector side.  The micro Session Reflector can verify whether the
   test packet is received from the expected member link.

3.1.  LAG Member Link ID TLV

   STAMP TLV [RFC8972] mechanism extends STAMP Test packets with one or
   more optional TLVs.  This document defines the TLV Type (value TBA1)
   for the LAG Member Link ID TLV that carries the micro STAMP Session-
   Sender member link identifier and Session-Reflector member link
   identifier.  The format of the LAG Member Link ID TLV is shown as
   follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |STAMP TLV Flags|  Type = TBA1  |           Length              |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     Sender Member Link ID     |   Reflector Member Link ID    |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                     Figure 2: LAG Member Link ID TLV

   o  Type: A one-octet field.  Value TBA1 is allocated by IANA
      (Section 5).

   o  Length: A two-octet field equal to the length of the Value field
      in octets.  The Length field value MUST be 4 octets.

   o  Sender Member Link ID (2-octets in length): it is defined to carry
      the LAG member link identifier of the Sender side.  The value of
      the Sender Member Link ID MUST be unique at the Session-Sender.

   o  Reflector Member Link ID (2-octets in length): it is defined to
      carry the LAG member link identifier of the Reflector side.  The
      value of the Reflector Member ID MUST be unique at the Session-
      Reflector.

3.2.  Micro STAMP-Test Procedures

   The micro STAMP-Test reuses the procedures as defined in Section 4 of
   STAMP [RFC8762] with the following additions.

   The micro STAMP Session-Sender MUST send the micro STAMP-Test packets
   over the member link with which the session is associated.  The
   configuration and management of the mapping between a micro STAMP
   session and the Sender/Reflector member link identifiers are outside
   the scope of this document.

   When sending a Test packet, the micro STAMP Session-Sender MUST set
   the Sender Member Link ID field with the member link identifier
   associated with the micro STAMP session.  If the Session-Sender knows
   the Reflector member link identifier, the Reflector Member Link ID
   field MUST be set.  Otherwise, the Reflector Member Link ID field
   MUST be zero.  The Reflector member link identifier can be obtained
   from pre-configuration or learned through data plane (e.g., learned
   from a reflected Test packet).  How to obtain/learn the Reflector
   member link identifier is outside of this document's scope.

   When the micro STAMP Session-Reflector receives a Test packet, if the
   Reflector Member Link ID is not zero, the micro STAMP Session-
   Reflector MUST use the Reflector member link identifier to check
   whether it is associated with the micro STAMP session.  If the
   validation fails, the Test packet MUST be discarded.  If all
   validations passed, the Session-Reflector sends a reflected Test
   packet to the Session-Sender.  The micro STAMP Session-Reflector MUST
   put the Sender and Reflector member link identifiers that are
   associated with the micro STAMP session in the Sender Member Link ID
   and Reflector Member Link ID fields respectively.  The Sender member
   link identifier is copied from the received Test packet.

   When receiving a reflected Test packet, the micro Session-Sender MUST
   use the Sender Member Link ID to validate whether the reflected Test
   packet is correctly transmitted over the expected member link.  If
   the validation fails, the Test packet MUST be discarded.  The micro
   Session-Sender MUST use the Reflector Member Link ID to validate the

   Reflector's behavior.  If the validation fails, the Test packet MUST
   be discarded.

4.  IANA Considerations

   In the "STAMP TLV Types" registry created for [RFC8972], a new STAMP
   TLV Type for LAG Member Link ID TLV is requested from IANA as
   follows:

   +----------------+-------------------+-----------------+------------+
   | STAMP TLV Type | Description       | Semantics       | Reference  |
   | Value          |                   | Definition      |            |
   +----------------+-------------------+-----------------+------------+
   | TBA1           | LAG Member Link   | Section 3       | This       |
   |                | ID TLV            |                 | Document   |
   +----------------+-------------------+-----------------+------------+

                            New STAMP TLV Type

5.  Security Considerations

   The STAMP extension defined in this document is intended for
   deployment in LAG scenario where Session-Sender and Session-Reflector
   are directly connnected.  As such, it's assumed that a node involved
   in STAMP protocol operation has previously verified the integrity of
   the LAG connection and the identity of its one-hop-away peer node.

   This document does not introduce any additional security issues and
   the security mechanisms defined in [RFC8762] and [RFC8972] apply in
   this document.
