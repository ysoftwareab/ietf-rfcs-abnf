Abstract

   This draft presents a LDAP schema for the DMTF CIM System model [5].

1. Introduction

   This draft presents a LDAPv3 [1,2] schema for the DMTF CIM System
   model.  It builds on the core model presented in [3].  Associations
   are mapped using a combination of auxiliary classes and DIT structure
   rules.  Where auxiliary classes are used, name form and DIT content
   rules are specified.

2. Class Definitions

   For efficiency in the LDAP representation, associations are specified
   as a combination of auxiliary classes and DIT structure rules.
   Attribute definitions for each class are presented with the object

   class.  Other definitions are also provided when necessary.

   This approach minimizes the number of DN pointers stored in the
   schema, but some pointer dereferencing is necessary.  While not
   explicitly stated in the definitions below, we assume that all
   attributes with DN support the matching rule defined in [3].
   Attribute names for DN pointers also follow the convention that a
   single pointer's name ends in "Ref", while an array of pointers' name
   ends in "Refs".

   Note: all OIDs are placeholders, and OIDs in definitions have been
   replaced by names for clarity.

   Several classes have attributes removed because they do not make
   sense for the directory to store: localDateTime, numberOfUsers,
   numberOfProcesses, totalSwapSpaceSize, totalVirtualMemorySize,
   freeVirtualMemory, freePhysicalMemory, totalVisibleMemorySize,
   sizeStoredInPagingFiles, freeSpaceInPagingFiles.  Further, a
   directory shouldn't store logicalfile information, including
   datafiles, directories, and devices shouldn't be stored Therefore the
   DeviceAccessedByFile, DirectoryContainsFile, Mount, Export, and
   FileStorage associations aren't included because referenced pieces
   are missing.

   A directory should not store either Process, Thread, Job, or
   JobDestination objects. Therefore the associations OSProcess,
   ProcessThread, ProcessExecutable, HostedJobDestination, and
   JobDestinationJobs aren't included either.

2.1 dmtfComponentCSAuxClass

   A ComputerSystem can aggregate another ComputerSystem. This
   association can be used to model MPP Systems with workstation
   frontends, an I2O subsystem embedded in a UnitaryComputerSystem, or a
   System that splits functionality between two processors, potentially
   running different OperatingSystems. For example, if a CISC Processor
   and its associated OperatingSystem, are used for user interface and
   file support, and a RISC Processor and its OS are used for complex
   mathematical operations, this could be modeled as two ComputerSystems
   where one aggregates the other. Sometimes, this could be modeled as a
   Cluster. The difference is the focus of the relationship. ComponentCS
   represents that unique and distinct ComputerSystems are aggregated by
   a higher level CS object. However, each of the component CSs are
   still distinguishable entities and are only viewed as such.
   Alternately, with a Cluster, the ComputerSystems that participate in
   it are inconsequential, when viewed through the 'Cluster System'.

   When instantiating or subclassing the ComponentCS relationship, care

   should be taken that the component ComputerSystem meets the
   definitional requirements of a ComputerSystem - ie, a functional
   whole that provides compute capabilities and aggregates System
   Devices, an OperatingSystem, etc.

   Lastly, in this class both groupComponentRefs and partComponentRefs
   point to dmtfComputerSystem objects.

   A Partition is an instance of a UnitaryComputerSystem (with its own

   supported by underlying hardware and software. A Partition is not a
   virtualization of a ComputerSystem, but the segmentation of the
   System's compute capabilities. Partitions can run independent copies
   of possibly different OperatingSystems and have dedicated Devices.
   The 'real', underlying System (perhaps a Cluster or another
   UnitaryComputerSystem) aggregates its Partitions. These semantics are
   described by the SystemPartition association.'

2.26 dmtfSystemBIOSAuxClass

   This auxiliary class associates a UnitaryComputerSystem's BIOS with
   the System itself.  In it, groupComponentRefs point to
   dmtfUnitaryComputerSystem objects and partComponentRefs point to
   dmtfBIOSElementObjects.
