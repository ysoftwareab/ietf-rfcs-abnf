Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects used for managing multicast
   function, independent of the specific multicast protocol(s) in use.
   This document obsoletes RFC 2932.

Internet-Draft                IP MCAST MIB                 December 2005


1.  Introduction

   This MIB describes objects used for managing IP multicast function,
   including IP multicast routing.  These objects are independent of the
   specific multicast routing protocol in use.  Managed objects specific
   to particular multicast protocols are defined elsewhere.

2.  History

   This document obsoletes [RFC2932].  The MIB module defined by this
   document is a re-working of the MIB module from [RFC2932], with
   changes that include the following.

   o  This MIB module is independent of address type, whereas [RFC2932]
      only supported IPv4.

   o  This MIB module allows several multicast protocols to perform
      routing on a single interface, where [RFC2932] assumed each
      interface supported at most one multicast routing protocol.

   o  This MIB module includes objects that are not specific to
      multicast routing.  It allows management of multicast function on
      systems that do not perform routing, whereas RFC 2932 was
      restricted to multicast routing.

   o  This MIB module includes a table of Source-Specific Multicast
      (SSM) address ranges to which SSM semantics [RFC3569] should be
      applied.

   o  This MIB module includes a table of local applications that are
      receiving multicast data.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,

   [RFC2578], STD 58, [RFC2579] and STD 58, [RFC2580].

4.  Overview

   This MIB module contains two scalars and seven tables.  The tables
   are:

   1.  The IP Multicast Interface Table containing multicast information
       specific to interfaces.

   2.  The IP Multicast SSM Range Table, which contains one row per
       range of multicast group addresses to which Source-Specific
       Multicast semantics [RFC3569] should be applied.

   3.  The IP Multicast Route Table containing multicast routing
       information for IP datagrams sent by particular sources to the IP
       multicast groups known to a system.

   4.  The IP Multicast Routing Next Hop Table containing information on
       next-hops for the routing of IP multicast datagrams.  Each entry
       is one of a list of next-hops on outgoing interfaces for
       particular sources sending to a particular multicast group
       address.

   5.  The IP Multicast Scope Boundary Table containing the boundaries
       configured for multicast scopes [RFC2365].

   6.  The IP Multicast Scope Name Table containing human-readable names
       of multicast scope.

   7.  The IP Multicast Local Listener Table containing identifiers for
       local applications that are receiving multicast data.

   This MIB module uses textual conventions defined in the IF-MIB
   [RFC2863], the INET-ADDRESS-MIB [RFC4001] and the IANA-RTPROTO-MIB.

            ordering imposed by SNMP useful when applied to language

            language tag to exceed the allowed length of this syntax,
            and thus be impossible to represent with this syntax.
            Sampling of language tags in current use on the Internet
            suggests that this limit does not pose a serious problem in
            practice."

6.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on



McWalter, et al.          Expires June 19, 2006                [Page 36]

Internet-Draft                IP MCAST MIB                 December 2005


   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   The following tables and objects could be employed to modify
   multicast routing behavior in a way that prevents or disrupts
   services provided by the network, including (but not limited to)
   multicast data traffic delivery.

   The following tables and objects may also be used to modify multicast
   routing behavior in order to intercept or subvert any information
   that is carried by the network.  For example, attacks can be
   envisaged that would pass nominated multicast data streams through a
   nominated location, without the sources or listeners becoming aware
   of this subversion.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to

   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   The following tables and objects could be employed to determine the
   topology, disposition, and composition of the network.  This
   information may be commercially sensitive, and may also be used in
   preparation for attacks, including any of the attacks described
   above.

   The following tables and objects may also be used to determine
   whether multicast data is flowing in the network, or has flowed
   recently.  They may also be used to determine the network location of
   senders and recipients.  An attacker can apply 'traffic analysis' to
   this data.  In some cases, the information revealed by traffic
   analyses can be as damaging as full knowledge of the data being
   transported.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   there is still no control over whom on the secure network is allowed
   to access (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to access (read/change/create/delete) them.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IP-MCAST-MIB should be rooted under the mib-2 subtree.  IANA is
   requested to assign { mib-2 XXX } to the IP-MCAST-MIB module
   specified in this document.

8.  Acknowledgements

   This MIB module is based on the original work in [RFC2932] by K.
   McCloghrie, D. Farinacci and D. Thaler.

   Suggested IPv6 multicast MIBs by R. Sivaramu and R. Raghunarayan have
   been used for comparison while editing this MIB module.

   The authors are also grateful to Bharat Joshi for his input and for
   several corrections.
