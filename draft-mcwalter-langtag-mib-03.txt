Abstract

   This MIB module defines a textual convention to represent BCP 47
   language tags.  The intent is that this textual convention will be
   imported and used in MIB modules that would otherwise define their
   own representation.

Internet-Draft               LANGTAG TC MIB                   March 2007


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   It defines a textual convention to represent BCP 47 [RFC4646]
   language tags.

   The LangTag textual convention defined by this RFC replaces the
   similar LanguageTag textual convention defined by RFC 2932 [RFC2932].

   The old LanguageTag textual convention is used by some existing MIB
   modules.  New MIB modules should use the LangTag textual convention,
   which has been created (and is to be preferred) for the following
   reasons:

   o  Its syntax description is current, and is more comprehensive.

   o  It is short enough to use as an index object without subtyping,
      yet is of adequate length to represent any language tag in
      practice.

   o  It is provided in a dedicated MIB module to simplify module
      dependencies.

   It is not possible to apply changes in syntax and length to an
   existing textual convention.  This is why the creation of a new
   textual convention with a new name was necessary.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

   STATUS      current
   DESCRIPTION
            "A language tag, constructed in accordance with BCP 47.

            Only lowercase characters are allowed.  The purpose of this
            restriction is to provide unique language tags for use as
            indexes.  BCP 47 recommends case conventions for user
            interfaces, but objects using this textual convention MUST
            use only lowercase.

            Values MUST be well-formed language tags, in conformance
            with the definition of well-formed tags in BCP 47.  An
            implementation MAY further limit the values it accepts to
            those permitted by a 'validating' processor, as defined in
            BCP 47.

            In theory, BCP 47 language tags are of unlimited length.
            The language tag described in this TC is of limited length.
            The analysis of language tag lengths in BCP 47 confirms that

            this limit will not pose a problem in practice.  In
            particular, this length is greater than the minimum
            requirements set out in section 4.3.1.

            A zero-length language tag is not a valid language tag.
            This can be used to express 'language tag absent' where
            required, for example when used as an index field."

5.  Security Considerations

   This MIB module does not define any management objects.  Instead, it
   defines a textual convention that may be imported by other MIB
   modules and used for object definitions.

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB
   modules that define management objects.  This document therefore has
   no impact on the security of the Internet.

6.  IANA Considerations

   LANGTAG-TC-MIB should be rooted under the mib-2 subtree.  IANA is
   requested to assign { mib-2 XXX } to the LANGTAG-TC-MIB module
   specified in this document.

7.  Notes to the RFC editor - remove before publication

   This document should be published simultaneously with IPMCAST-MIB
   (draft-ietf-mboned-ip-mcast-mib).

   This is because LANGTAG-MIB replaces the LanguageTag textual
   convention that is already present in RFC 2932, which will be
   obsoleted by the publication of IPMCAST-MIB.

8.  Acknowledgements

   This MIB module is a reworking of existing material from RFC 2932.

   This module was generated by editing together contributions from
   Randy Presuhn, Dan Romascanu, Bill Fenner, Juergen Schoenwaelder,
   Bert Wijnen, Doug Ewell, and Ira McDonald.
