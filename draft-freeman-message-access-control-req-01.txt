                Requirements for Message Access Control
              draft-freeman-message-access-control-req-01

Abstract 

  There are many situations where organizations want to include
  information which is subject to regulatory or other complex access
  control policy in email. Regulated information requires some form of
  robust access control to protect the confidentiality of the
  information. The Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME [rfc2634]
  defines an access control mechanism for S/MIME (eSSSecurityLabel).
  This is a signed attribute of a SignedData object which indicates the
  access control policy for the message. The fact that this is a signed
  attribute protects the integrity of the data and the binding of the
  label to the message but does not protect the confidentiality of the
  information i.e. at the point where you lean the access control policy
  to the data you also have access to the data. While the signature
  provides integrity for the label over the clear text, it is
  susceptible to unauthorized removal i.e. if you only have SignedData
  message, any MTA in the mail path can remove a signature layer and
  therefore remove the access control data.  Encrypting the signed
  message protects the confidentiality of the data and protects the
  SignedData from unauthorized removal but this hides the ESS security
  label.

  From a regulatory enforcement perspective this is an extremely weak
  form of access control because cryptographic access to the data is
  given before the access check. The correct enforcement of the access
  check totally depends on the configuration of the recipients email
  client. Since the cryptographic access is granted before the access
  checks, there is no significant impediment for a recipient who is
  unauthorized under the policy to access the data. A stronger
  enforcement model is needed for regulatory control for email where
  cryptographic access is only granted after the access check.

  There are also many users on the Internet today who have some form of
  authentication credential but they are not X.509 certificates and who
  therefore cannot use S/MIME. There are now available, standard based
  services (e.g. [SAML-overview]) which abstract the specifics of a
  technology used to authenticate uses from the application itself

  (S/MIME in this case). Adoption of this abstraction model would enable
  a broader set of users who have other types to authentication
  credentials to be able to use S/MIME to secure email. It also allows
  for new authentication technology to be deployed without impacting the
  core S/MIME protocol. 

  This document specifies the requirements for:-

      Providing robust access control for S/MIME

      An abstraction layer for supporting other types of credentials for
      using S/MIME.

1.  Introduction

   The S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) standard
   today provides digital signatures for message integrity,
   authentication, and non-repudiation of origin and encryption for data
   confidentiality. These security services are currently solely based
   on X.509 certificates. This means anyone without an X.509 certificate
   is unable to leverage the S/MIME protocol for securing email. The
   vast majority of users on the Internet have other forms of
   credentials (passwords, one time passwords, GPG/PGP keys etc.). 

   An access control policy defines a set of criteria which is required
   in order to grant access to the information. These criteria are
   defined in terms of attributes about the subject requesting access.
   Examples of the types of attributes would include what roles the
   subject is assigned to (Role Based Access Control) or one or more
   attributes about the subject (attribute Based Access Control).
   Standards now exist to exchange subject attributes [SAML-overview].
   Adoption of these subject attribute protocols would allow a rich set
   of access control polices to be supported by S/MIME in line with
   other applications.

1.2  Keywords

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

3.  Background

   The S/MIME standard [rfc5751] provides a method to send and receive
   secure MIME messages. While CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax) allows
   for other types of security credentials to be used, S/MIME
   exclusively uses X.509 certificates [rfc5750] for the security
   credentials used for signing and encryption operations.  S/MIME uses
   an early binding mechanism for encryption keys where the sender needs
   to discover the public key for every recipient of encrypted messages
   before they can send the encrypted message. The sender needs to
   maintain a cache of all potential recipient certificates (e.g. in a
   personal address book) and/or find an acceptable certificate for the
   recipient from a repository. This key management model has limited
   the use of S/MIME for encryption for a variety of reasons. For
   example:

   o  The recipient may not have an X.509 encryption certificate
   o  The sender may not have received a signed email with the recipient
      certificate
   o  The recipient may not have an available repository
   o  The sender may be unaware of the location of the recipients
      repository
   o  The recipient's repository may not be accessible to the sender
      e.g. it's behind a firewall

  If one or more recipient certificates are missing then the sender is
  left with a stark choice: send the message unencrypted or remove the
  recipients without certificates from the message.

  The use of secure mailing lists can be thought of as a form of late-
  binding of recipient information as the originating sender does not
  need to know the set of recipients or the security information for the
  recipients.  However it is still early-binding for the mail list agent
  as it needs to perform all of the gathering and processing of
  certificate information for every recipient that it will be sending
  the message to.

  In many regulated environments end-to-end confidentiality between
  sender and recipients by itself is not enough. The regulatory policy
  requires some form of access control checks before access to the data
  should be granted. In many inter-organization collaboration scenarios
  it's impossible for the sender to satisfy the access checks on behalf

  of the recipients since they don't have and should not have access to
  all the attributes about the recipients because to do so may be a
  breach of the recipients privacy. It's a fundamental tenet of good
  security practice that users must be in control of the release of data
  about themselves.

3.1  ESS Security Labels

  Security labels are an optional security service for S/MIME defined in
  Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME [rfc2634].  The ESS security
  label allows classification of the sensitivity of the message contents
  using a hierarchical taxonomy in terms of the impact of unauthorized
  disclosure of the information [rfc3114].  The security label can also
  indicate access control such as full time employees only or US
  nationals only. ESS security labels are authenticated attributes of a
  signer-info structure in a SignedData object.  The label when applied
  to signed clear text data provides the access control decisions for
  the plain text. If applied to cipher text such as with the other layer
  of a triple wrapped S/MIME message the label is used for course
  grained optimization such as routing. 

3.1.1 Problems With ESS Security Labels

  ESS Security Labels have been found to have a number of limitations.

   1. They do not provide a mechanism for an email client to discover a
      new access control policy if the message contains a policy the
      client is unaware of. This provides a stark choice: ignore the
      access control policy and grant access to the message or block
      access to the message. 
   2. The current ESS standard only allows a single policy label. This
      is adequate for course grained policy binding to express a limited
      set of choices such as with sensitivity which typically a
      hierarchy of 3-5 choices. Many data sets are subject to multiple
      fine-grained access control polices. For instance, a message may
      contain information that is both proprietary and export
      controlled. Trying to represent combinations of polices via a
      single policy label would lead to an exponential growth in the
      number of policy labels. 
   3. They do not provide for any auditing of who has been granted
      accessed the message.
   4. The authoritative label for the access control is a signed
      attribute inside the enveloped data. The envelope is decrypted by
      the client who then reads and hopefully enforces the access
      control.  What that means is users who under the policy are not
      allowed access to the information have no cryptographic impediment
      to access the information. Compliance with the policy is dependent
      on the state of the configuration of every receiving agent. This
 


Freeman et al.         Expires November 28, 2011                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Message Access Control     May 27, 2011


      makes policy compliance practically impossible anything but a
      small closed environment. 
   5. Access to the message cannot be granted or removed after the
      message has been sent, but before it has been received.

  The policy is implemented and enforced solely by the receiving agent.
  This means that all access polices have to be distributed to all
  recipients receiving agents. This again makes policy compliance
  practically impossible anything but a small closed environment.

3.2 Access Control and the Web

  A prerequisite for many web transactions is the disclosure of
  attributes about the subject such as name, age, email address,
  physical location, address, credit card number, social security number
  etc. Some attributes lend themselves to easy verification but many do
  not. An assertion of an email address can be verified by sending an
  email to the address containing a secret ephemeral challenge.
  Subsequent demonstration of knowledge of the ephemeral challenge
  verifies the email address assertion. Other assertions such as "this
  is my credit card account number" are not easily verified. The fact it
  is a valid credit card number can be verified but not the binding to
  the subject attempting to use it.  Where a claim is not easily
  verified they are often combined with other assertions under the
  assumption that knowledge of this larger data set verifies all the
  assertions in the data set if you know the account number, billing
  address etc., of course you must be the account holder. This is a very
  weak form of verification as is often demonstrated via the growth of
  identity theft much of this bigger data set data set is often publicly
  via social networks or easily guessed e.g. the most popular
  professions for a parent is dead or retired. Many of these assertions
  which are harder to verify are based on government issued documents
  such as a birth certificates, driver's license, identity card or
  passport. This requires an exchange of the documents between the
  relying party and the subject. For a small number of high value
  transactions (e.g. opening a new account) with relying parties that
  have widespread physical presence (a bank) this is acceptable because
  the applicant can present themselves with the required documentation
  in person. However with web based relying parties they cannot perform
  an in person exchange of documents to verify information on government
  issued documents. The approach taken with such relying parties is to
  have trusted assertion providers where the assertion provider can
  perform an in person exchange of documents with the subject then vouch
  for the set of assertions they have verified.

  SAML [SAML-core] defines an XML framework for describing and
  exchanging attributes about subjects. The entity making the assertions
  about the subject is known as the assertion provider, the entity
 


Freeman et al.         Expires November 28, 2011                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Message Access Control     May 27, 2011


  consuming the assertions is known as the relying party. The well-known
  scenarios for using SAML are:


      o Single Sign On across systems on different platform technology

      o Federated Identity between business partners

      o Web Services and other standards e.g. SOAP based protocols

  The critical difference between SAML and pure authentication protocols
  such as mutually authenticated TLS is that SAML is able to exchange a
  rich set of assertions which are frequently necessary for authorizing
  transactions. X.509 certificate can exchange a limited set of identity
  assertions such as an x.500 distinguished name, email address,
  Kerberos principal name, etc. SAML is able to do this plus an
  extensible set of other assertions about the subject such as, date of
  birth or business sign-off limits levels etc., etc.

  SAML also abstracts the details of the authentication protocol from
  the relying party. The assertion provider can use a broad range of
  authentication mechanisms such as passwords, one time passwords,
  biometrics, X.509 etc., without impacting the relying party. The
  assertion provider can include the details of the authentication
  mechanism or its strength using an established strength scale such as
  NIST SP800-63-1[sp800-63-1]. The relying party can then inspect the
  claims about how or how strongly the subject authenticated to the
  identity provider to determine if it complies with its access policy.
  Low value transactions can use simple short lived assertions where
  possession of the assertion alone is considered acceptable for the
  transaction risk. These are known as Bearer assertions.  Higher value
  transaction can require proof of possession keys (either symmetric or
  asymmetric cryptographic keys) where the subject demonstrates
  knowledge of a cryptographic secret to the relying party via a HMAC or
  digital signature. These are defined by the SAML specification as
  Holder of Key assertions. The subject has to demonstrate possession of
  the key to the relying party.  Holder of key assertions can be either
  symmetric or asymmetric keys.

3.3 Information Asset Protection

  Information Asset Protection (IAP) is a concept developed by the
  Trasglobal Secure Collaboration Program (TSCP), a working group
  comprised of the major players in the western Aerospace and Defense
  industry.  The industry is highly regulated and operates in an
  environment with many policies governing the access to information
  assets. These policies may be motivated by the desire to protect
  intellectual property, the confidentiality of information, or are
 


Freeman et al.         Expires November 28, 2011                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Message Access Control     May 27, 2011


  imposed by government regulators such as the US International
  Trafficking Arms Regulations (ITAR). They apply to the information
  assets in whatever form the asset may take and are independent of the
  application used to create the information. These policies take many
  forms, e.g. verification the recipient has demonstrated a need to know
  the information because they are working on a specific project, that
  they have passed the appropriate background and nationality checks, or
  that they have signed the appropriate non-disclosure agreement. What
  is needed is a policy driven information centric protection where the
  applicable policies either is manually or automatically attached to
  the information and based on the policy the system understands what
  access control and data protection is necessary.

  Email is an application widely used in the Aerospace and Defense
  industry. S/MIME is widely used today and provides sender to recipient
  confidentiality. This protects the contents of the message from
  discloser to unauthorized third parties e.g. while it is in transit
  between MTA's or while at rest in a MTA message queue or recipients
  mailbox. However it does not impose any finer grained access control
  such as those required by many policies. S/MIME does define an
  extension mechanism for access control via an ESS security label
  [rfc2634] thou this mechanism has drawbacks (see above).

3.4 Authentication Assurance Frameworks

  A number of organizations have created taxonomies to define the
  possible levels of identity assurance for electronic authentication.
  These taxonomies have been drafted by industry organizations [lib-
  iaf][kan-iaf] and governments [sp800-63-1]. The objective of the
  framework is to define a simple abstraction for use between identity
  providers and relying parties which more easily maps to the business
  requirements. While all of these frameworks may not agree on every
  aspect, at a macro level they do exhibit many similarities. A common
  theme in many is the adoption of 4 levels of identity assurance.

   1. Negligible confidence in the asserted identity
   2. Some confidence in the asserted identity
   3. Significant confidence in the asserted identity
   4. High confidence in the asserted identity

  The framework defines broad characteristics in the area of identity
  proofing, credential type and management, identity provider
  authentication and relying party authentication.

4 Use Case Scenarios

  This section documents some use case scenarios the new protocol aims
  to support.

4.1 Business to Consumer Secure Email

  There are many examples of business to consumer secure email scenarios
  where the email would contain potentially sensitive data. This would
  include doctor, patient; bank, account holder, Medical insurance,
  insured person. Alice is a doctor and has received test results for
  her patient Bob.  The information is confidential so any channel of
  communication she selects must protect the Bob's privacy. Alice elects
  to use email to reach Bob quickly with news of the results. She must
  ensure that:

   1. Only Bob can read the email 
   2. The Bob authenticates with an acceptable level of identity
      assurance to ensure its actually Bob reading the message
   3. The Bob can verify the email is from  Alice
   4. The Bob can verify the email has not been tampered with


  Alice composes the email to Bob. She include some comments and
  suggestions for Bob and attaches the test results.

  Alice's email client allows her to classify the email. Alice
  classifies the email as a Doctor-Patient communication.

  Alice's  email client knows the protections to apply to Doctor-Patient
  communication; it know to encrypt and integrity-protects the me and
  what level of assurance required for the recipients identity.

  The protected email is able to flow securely and seamlessly through
  existing email infrastructure to Bob.  The data is protected while in
  transit or at rest.

  Bob receives the email as sees its a secure message from Alice. Bob
  opens the email. Bob is able to prove his identity to the level
  requested by Alice so is is able to read the email.

  If Bob reply's to the email from Alice, the new message inherits the
  policy from the original message so doctor-patient messages and
  replies to doctor-patient messages have the same policy. The doctor-
  patient policy does not apply to messages forwarded by Bob because is
  allowed to make his own choices for protecting of the continents when
  sharing with others. 

4.2 Business to Business Ad-Hoc Email

  Early in the relationship between two companies there may be an
  exchange of sensitive information before the relationship has matured
  to the point where the relationship may be formally reflected in some

  form of agreement. Business owners want the agility to interact with
  potential partners without having to engage there IT staff as a
  prerequisite of the transaction. 

  Charlie works for Company Foo. He has just met Dave from Company Bar
  to discuss the prospect of a potential new business opportunity.
  Following the meeting, Charlie want to send Dave some sensitive
  information relating to the new business opportunity. When Charlie 
  sends the email to Dave with the sensitive content, Charlie must
  ensure:-

   1. Only Dave  can read the email 
   2. The Dave authenticates with an acceptable level of identity
      assurance to ensure its actually Dave reading the message
   3. The Dave can verify the email is from Charlie
   4. The Dave can verify the email has not been tampered with


  Charlie composes the email to Dave. He include some sensible
  information relating to potential terms and conditions for the new
  contract that Foo and Bar would sign to form a partnership for the
  business opportunity. 

  Charlie's email client allows him to classify the email. Her
  classifies the email as an Ad-hoc pre-contractual communication.

  Charlie's client knows the protections to apply to Ad-hoc pre-
  contractual communication; it know to encrypt and integrity-protect
  the message and the level of assurance required for the recipients
  identity.

  The protected email is able to flow securely and seamlessly through
  existing email infrastructure to the colleague.  The data is protected
  while in transit or at rest.

  Dave receives the email as sees its a secure message from Charlie.
  Dave is able to prove his identity to the level requested by Charlie
  so is is able to read the email. Dave opens the email.

  If Dave reply's to the email from Charlie, the new message inherits
  the policy from the original messages so the entire message thread 
  has the same policy. The policy also applies to messages forwarded by
  Dave because it contains information from Charlie and Company Foo
  wants consistent policy enforcement on its information.   

4.3 Business to Business Regulated Email 

  As business relationship mature they often result in a formal

  contractual agreement to work together. The agreement would define a
  number of work areas and deliverables. These deliverables may be
  subject to multiple corporate and or regulatory policies for access
  control, authentication and integrity. The set of policies applicable
  to an email is potentialy subject to change as the different users
  contribute information to the email thread.

  Company Foo has been awarded a contract to build some equipment
  (Program X). The equipment is covered by export control. Company Bar
  is a subcontractor to company Foo working on Program X. Company Foo
  sets up some business rules for access to program X data to ensure
  compliance with export control requirements. Company Foo also set up
  separate rules to cover the protection of its intellectual property
  contributed to Program A. Company Bar also sets up its own polices to
  protect its own intellectual property it contributes to Program X. As
  part of the agreement between Foo and Bar, they have agreed to
  mutually respect each others policies.

  Frank is an employee of Company Foo. He has been assigned to Program X
  and wants to send some mail to colleagues working on Program X in both
  Companies Foo and Bar. Grace is an employee of Company Bar. She has
  been assigned to Program X.  When Frank sends the email with Program X
  regulated content he must ensure compliance with the export control
  polices. If Frank includes Company Foo intellectual property, he must
  also ensure compliance with his corporate IP protection policies. When
  Frank sends a Program X email he must ensure:

      1. Only recipients who meet the Program X policy or Company Foo's
      intellectual property protection policy can read the email 

      2. The recipients authenticates with an acceptable level of
      assurance as defined by the set of policies applied to the message

      3. Recipients present any other attributes about themselves
      necessary to verify compliance with the applicable policies.

      3. The recipients can verify who the email is from to an
      acceptable level of assurance as defined by the message policy 

      4. The recipients can verify the email has not been tampered with
      to an acceptable level of assurance as defined by the message
      policy

      5. They can also tell it is a Program X email and the contents can
      only be shared with other Program X workers.

  Frank composes the email and includes a set of recipients in both
  Companies Foo and Bar. He include some information relation to Program

  X. Frank also includes some information which is Company Foo's IP.

  Franks email client allows him to classify the message.  Frank
  classifies the email as Program X and Company Foo proprietary
  information.

  The email client knows the protections to apply to the email; to
  encrypt and integrity-protect the message, the level of assurance
  required for the recipients identity and what recipient attributes are
  necessary to access the message.

  The email is able to flow securely and seamlessly through existing
  email infrastructure to Grace.  The data is protected while in transit
  or at rest.

  Grace receives the email as sees its a secure message from Frank. 
  Grace is able to prove her identity to the level requested by Frank
  and provides the requested attributes about herself to satisfy both
  the Program X export control and the Company Foo IP protection
  policies. Grace opens the email.

  If Grace reply's to the email from Frank, the new message inherits the
  policy from the original messages. Grace includes some information
  which is Company Bar's IP so add her companies IP protection policy
  requirements to the message.

  Frank receives the reply from Grace. Frank is able to prove his
  identity to the level requested by Grace and provides the requested
  attributes about him,self to satisfy both the Program X export
  control, the Company Foo IP protection policies as well as the Company
  Bar IP protection policies. Frank opens the email.

  The policy also applies to messages forwarded by Frank because it
  contains information from Company Foo and Company Bar both companies
  wants consistent policy enforcement on its information.


4.4 Email Pipeline Inspection

  Unsolicited bulk email (aka spam) is a problem for organizations.
  Email can also contain malicious content such as viruses or attempts
  at phishing. To combat these threats, server side scanning of the
  email messages before they reach the recipient is an effective
  countermeasure. Authorized agents must be capable of getting access to
  the message.

  Company Foo receives email from the Internet. Company Foo has a policy
  to scan inbound email with a view to remove inappropriate or malicious

  content. They have a server which scans email from the Internet. The
  server has the ability to identify itself as a subject for Foo who is
  authorized to scan email on behalf of Foo recipients. It has or can
  request access to encrypted email. It has a local policy on what
  content to remove and on to reject email which is cannot scan.

4.5 Related scenarios There are other scenarios which are related to the
  email cases because they would be subject to the same policy
  requirements. Email allows users to create content and transport it to
  a set of recipients. You can perform similar actions with other
  formats such as documents and instant messages. Policy is agnostic to
  the underlying technology therefore if an organization has a policy
  relating to a type of information, then that policy would apply to the
  same content in an email, a document an instant message, etc, etc.

            Figure 1 General Scheme for Publishing Protected Content

  4.5.1 Document Protection

  This scenario is very similar to 4.2 and 4.3 above. The difference is
  that the information being generated is in the form of a document not
  an email. It could be as part of an ad-hoc sharing or a regulated
  sharing or information.

  Frank is an employee of Company Foo. He has been assigned to Program
  X. Grace is an employee of Company Bar. She has been assigned to
  Program X. Frank creates a document for the program. He also includes
  some Company Foo IP in the document. When Frank creates the document
  he must ensure compliance with export control regulations and his
  corporate IP protection policies. Fran must ensure:

      1. Only users who meet the Program X policy or Company Foo's
      intellectual property protection policy can open the document 

      2. Users authenticates with an acceptable level of assurance as
      defined by the set of policies applied to the document

      3. Users present any other attributes about themselves necessary
      to verify compliance with the applicable policies.

      3. Users can verify who the author was to an acceptable level of
      assurance as defined by the document policy 

      4. Users can verify the document has not been tampered with to an
      acceptable level of assurance as defined by the document policy

      5. They can also tell it is a Program X document and the contents
      can only be shared with other Program X workers.



  Frank creates a document for Program X. He include some information
  relation to Program X. Frank also includes some information which is
  Company Foo's IP.

  Franks word processor client allows him to classify the document. 
  Frank classifies the document as Program X and Company Foo proprietary
  information.

  The word processor client knows the protections to apply to the
  document; to encrypt and integrity-protect the document, the level of
  assurance required for the users identity and what user attributes are
  necessary to access the document.

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Message Access Control     May 27, 2011


  The document is able to be published on a cloud based Web portal. The
  document is protected while in transit to the portal or at rest on the
  portal. The document is also protected on any backup or replica of the
  portal data. Frank does not to worry about where on the portal he
  publishes the document. He can make the most appropriate choose based
  on the the project and the document content.  

  Grace sees the document on the portal and tries to open the document.
  Grace is able to prove her identity to the level requested by Frank
  and provides the requested attributes about herself to satisfy both
  the Program X export control and the Company Foo IP protection
  policies. Grace opens the document.

  If Grace edits the document and includes some information which is
  Company Bar's IP so adds her companies IP protection policy
  requirements to the document. Grace saves the updated document to the
  same location on the portal.

  Frank see that Grace has updated the document on the portal. Frank is
  able to prove his identity to the level requested by both the Company
  Foo and company Bar policies and provides the requested attributes
  about himself to satisfy both the Program X export control, the
  Company Foo IP protection policies as well as the Company Bar IP
  protection policies. Frank opens the document.

5 Message Protection Requirements

5.1 General Requirements

  Protected email MUST be where messages can be considered "secure"
  which means confidential, integrity protected AND authenticated. 

  Every authentication has a level of assurance associated with it
  depending on attributes such as the identity checks made about the
  subject and the authentication technology used. The authentication of
  senders and recipients MUST allow for the multiple levels of identity
  assurance.

  The specifics of how the recipient achieves the required level of
  identity assurance MUST be abstracted from the email system e.g. by
  the use of SAML [SAML-core] attributes.

  Cryptographic access the message MUST only be provided after the
  recipient has provided suitable valid attributes as defined by the
  sender.

  If the sender has not signed the message themselves i.e. the message
  is signed on behalf of the sender, Recipients MUST receive
 


Freeman et al.         Expires November 28, 2011               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Message Access Control     May 27, 2011


  authenticated attributes from the signer about the identity of the
  sender, the level of identity assurance of the sender with the signer
  and the cryptographic fingerprint of the senders' message so the
  recipient can confirm the signed messages is the same as the senders
  message.

  The decryption key exchange MUST support multiple levels of assurance.
  The level of assurance requited MUST be selected by the sender. 

  Recipients MUST securely receive the message decryption key(s). A
  range of assurance levels MUST be provides for the key exchange. For
  example, for low assurance situations this could be over a secure
  transport such as SSL. For high assurance situations recipient MAY be
  required to provide a suitable key exchange key such as an X.509
  certificate.

  Mail pipeline agents MUST be able to get access to encrypted content
  under the control of policy of the sender. It MUST be possible for
  domains to publish keys for such agents so senders can pre-authorize
  agents of recipient domains at send time for email scanning. It MUST
  be possible for domains to request access to protected messages which
  have not been preauthorized by the sender. 

  If a third party is used to arbitrate the message access control, the
  third party MUST NOT be required to maintain per message state.

5.2 Basic Policy Requirements

  Basic policy is intended to be equivalent to sending encrypted email
  with S/MIME today. It is a simple policy that authenticated recipients
  of the email get access to the message. Its intended target is simple
  scenarios involving consumers and small businesses. 

  When using Basic Policy, the sending agent MUST define the list of
  recipients AND the level of authentication assurance required. 

  The recipient MUST be required to provide at least two attributes,
  their email address and the level of authentication assurance of the
  identity.

  Basic policy MUST support multiple levels of identity assurance. The
  levels of identity assurance MUST map to an existing identity
  authentication assurance framework e.g. to NIST 800-63-1 or
  equivalent.

  A sender using Basic policy MUST be able to send protected messages
  without discovering any recipient's encryption key.

 


Freeman et al.         Expires November 28, 2011               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Message Access Control     May 27, 2011


  Using basic policy MUST NOT require bilateral agreements between
  sender and recipients a priori to sending the message. 

  The use of Basic Policy MUST be backwards compatible with existing
  S/MIME. A sender's agent MAY discover some recipient's certificates
  and create recipient info structures as per the existing standard and
  elect to use the new mechanism for recipients it cannot discover keys
  for rather than remove the recipients without certificates.

5.3 Advanced Policy Requirements

  Advanced policy is intended to be used where one or more arbitrary
  access control policies are required on the content of the message. It
  is intended to target more complex scenarios such as email with
  regulated content or content subject to organization policies.

  It MUST be possible to apply one or more Advanced Policies to a
  message. Where 2 or more policies are applied to a message, the
  logical relationship between the policies MUST also be expressed i.e.
  are the policies a logical AND or a logical OR.

  The specifics of the access control policy MUST be abstracted from the
  client i.e. the recipients client MUST NOT make the access control
  decision.

  Advanced policy can use either early or late key binding. The choice
  MUST be defined by the message access control policy.  If using early
  key binding, the binding data can only be disclosed to the recipient
  after they have successfully passed the access check.

  The recipient's client MUST NOT be expected to have received a priori
  of the message arrival any access control policies or configuration
  specific to an access control policy.

  Upon each access of the content of the email, the attributes MUST be
  verified anew prior to cryptographic access being granted to the
  content of the email.

5.  IANA Considerations

  This document describes the requirements for message access control.
  As such no action by IANA is necessary for this document

6.  Security Considerations

  Authentication by itself is not a good trust indicator for users.
  Authentication raises the level of assurance the identity is correct
  but does not address whether the identity is trustworthy or noteworthy
 


Freeman et al.         Expires November 28, 2011               [Page 18]

Internet-Draft  Requirements for Message Access Control     May 27, 2011


  to the recipient.  Authentication should be coupled with some form of
  reputation e.g. the domain is on a white list or is not or a black
  list. Malicious actors may attempt to "legitimize" a message if an
  indication of authentication is not coupled with some form of
  reputation.

  Malicious actors could attempt to use encrypted email as a way to
  bypass existing message pipeline controls or to mine information from
  a domain. Domain should have sufficient granularity of policy to
  handle situations where their email pipeline agents have not been
  authorized to inspect the contents.

  It must be possible for a third party to, upon correctly presenting a
  legitimate legal justification, to recover the content of a message.
  This includes the Senders and Recipients companies for business
  continuity purposes, as well as Law Enforcement. If the entity
  requesting the information and the entity controlling the access are
  in different jurisdictions, then the process would be subject to some
  form of rendition.
