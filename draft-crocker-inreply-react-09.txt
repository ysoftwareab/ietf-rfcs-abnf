1.  Introduction

   The popularity of social media has led to user comfort with easily
   signaling summary reactions to an author's posting, by using basic
   emoji graphics, such as with a 'thumbs up', 'heart', or 'smiley'
   indication.  Sometimes the permitted repertoire is constrained to a
   small set and sometimes a more extensive range of indicators is
   supported.

   This specification extends existing practice in social media and
   instant messaging into Internet Mail.

   While it is already possible to include symbols and graphics as part
   of an email reply's content, there has not been an established means
   of signalling the semantic substance that such data are to be taken
   as a summary 'reaction' to the original message.  That is, a
   mechanism to identify symbols as specifically providing a summary
   reaction to the cited message, rather than merely being part of the
   free text in the body of a response.  Such a structured use of the
   symbol(s) allows recipient MUAs to correlate this reaction to the
   original message and possibly to display the information
   distinctively.

   This facility defines a new MIME Content-Disposition, to be used in
   conjunction with the In-Reply-To header field, to specify that a part
   of a message containing one or more emojis be treated as a summary
   reaction to a previous message.

   Unless provided here, terminology, architecture and specification
   notation used in this document are incorporated from [Mail-Arch],

Internet-Draft                  reaction                   February 2021


   [Mail-Fmt], [MIME], and [ABNF].  The ABNF rule Emoji-Seq is inherited
   from [Emoji-Seq].

   Normative language, per [RFC8174]:

      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
      "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
      described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they
      appear in all capitals, as shown here.

2.  Reaction Content-Disposition

   A message sent as a reply MAY include a part containing:

   Content-Disposition: Reaction

   If such a field is specified the Content-Type of the part MUST be:

   Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

   The content of this part is restricted to single line of emoji.  The
   [ABNF] is:

part-content =  emoji *(lwsp emoji) CRLF

emoji = emoji_sequence
emoji_sequence = { defined in [Emoji-Seq] }

base-emojis = thumbs-up / thumbs-down / grinning-face / frowning-face / crying-face

thumbs-up = {U+1F44D}
thumbs-down = {U+1F44E}
grinning-face = {U+1F600}
frowning-face = {U+2639}
crying-face = {U+1F622}

   The rule emoji_sequence is inherited from [Emoji-Seq].  It defines a
   set of octet sequences, each of which forms a single pictograph.

   The rule base-emojis MAY be used as a simple, common list, or
   'vocabulary' of emojis.  It was developed from some existing
   practice, in social networking, and is intended for similar use.
   However support for it as a base vocabulary is not required.  Having
   providers and consumers employ a common set will facilitate user
   interoperability, but different sets of users might want to have
   different, common (shared) sets.

   The emoji(s) express a recipient's summary reaction to the specific
   message referenced by the accompanying In-Reply-To header field, for
   the message in which they both are present.  [Mail-Fmt].  For
   processing details, see Section 3.

   Reference to unallocated code points SHOULD NOT be treated as an
   error; the corresponding octets SHOULD be processed using the system
   default method for denoting an unallocated or undisplayable code
   point.

3.  Reaction Message Processing

   The presentation aspects of reaction processing are necessarily MUA-
   specific and beyond the scope of this specification.  In terms of the
   message itself, a recipient MUA that supports this mechanism operates
   as follows:

   1.  If a received message R contains an In-Reply-To: header-field,
       check to see if it references a previous message the MUA has sent
       or received.

   2.  If R's In-Reply-To: does reference one, then check R's message
       content for a part with a "reaction" Content-Disposition header
       field, at either the outermost level or as part of a multipart at
       the outermost level.

   3.  If such a part is found, and the content of the part conforms to
       the restrictions outlined above, remove the part from the message
       and process the part as a reaction.

   4.  Processing terminates if no parts remain in the message.  If
       parts remain process the remaining message content as a reply.

   Again, the handling of a message that has been successfully processed
   is MUA-specific and beyond the scope of this specification.

4.  Usability Considerations

   This specification defines a mechanism for the structuring and
   carriage of information.  It does not define any user-level details
   of use.  However the design of the user-level mechanisms associated
   with this facility is paramount.  This section discusses some issues
   to consider.

   Creation:    Because an email environment is different from a typical
      social media platform, there are significant -- and potentially
      challenging -- choices in the design of the user interface, to
      support indication of a reaction.  Is the reaction to be sent only

Internet-Draft                  reaction                   February 2021


      to the original author, or should it be sent to all recipients?
      Should the reaction always be sent in a discrete message
      containing only the reaction, or should the user also be able to
      include other message content?  (Note that carriage of the
      reaction in a normal email message enables inclusion of this other
      content.)

   Display:    Reaction indications might be more useful when displayed
      in close visual proximity to the original message, rather than
      merely as part of an email response thread.  The handling of
      multiple reactions, from the same person, is also an opportunity
      for possibly-interesting user experience design choice.

   Culture:    The use of an image, intended to serve as a semantic
      signal, is determined and affected by cultural factors, which
      differ in complexity and nuance.  It is important to remain aware
      that an author's intent when sending a particular emoji might not
      match how the recipient interprets it.  Even simple, commonly used
      emojis may be subject to these cultural differences.

4.1.  Example Message

   A simple message exchange might be:

   To: recipient@example.com
   From: author@example.com
   Date: Today, 29 February 2021 00:00:00 -800
   Message-id: 12345@example.com
   Subject: Meeting

   Can we chat at 1pm pacific, today?

   with a thumbs-up, affirmative response of:

   To: author@example.com
   From: recipient@example.org
   Date: Today, 29 February 2021 00:00:10 -800
   Message-id: 56789@example.org
   In-Reply-To:12345@example.com
   Subject: Meeting
   Mime-Version: 1.0 (1.0)
   Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
   Content-Disposition: Reaction

   {U+1F44E}

   It could, of course, be more elaborate, such as the first of a MIME
   multipart sequence.

4.2.  Example Display

   Repeating the caution that actual use of this capability requires
   careful usability design and testing, this section offers simple
   examples -- which have not been tested -- of how the reaction
   response might be displayed in a summary list of messages :

   Summary:    Summary listings of messages in a folder include columns
      such as Subject, From, and Date.  Another might be added, to show
      common reactions and a count of how many of them have been
      received.

   Message:    A complete message is often displayed with a tailored
      section for header-fields, enhancing the format and showing only
      selected header fields.  It might add a field for reactions, again
      showing the symbol and a count.

5.  Security Considerations

   This specification employs message content that is a strict subset of
   existing content, and thus introduces no new content-specific
   security considerations.  The fact that this content is structured
   might seem to make it a new threat surface, but there is no analysis
   demonstrating that it does.

   This specification defines a distinct Content-Disposition value, for
   specialized message content.  Processing that handles the content
   differently from other content in the message body might introduce
   vulnerabilities.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to register the Reaction MIME Content-
   Disposition parameter, per [RFC2183]

    Content-Disposition parameter name:    Reaction

   Allowable values for this parameter:    (none)

    Description:   Permit a recipient to respond by signaling basic
      reactions to an author's posting, such as with a 'thumbs up' or
      'smiley' graphic

7.  Experimental Goals

   The basic, email-specific mechanics for this capability are well-
   established and well-understood.  Points of concern, therefore, are

   with market interest and with usability.  So the questions to answer,
   while the header field has experimental status are:

   o  Is there demonstrated interest by MUA developers?

   o  If MUA developers add this capability, is it used by authors?

   o  Does the presence of the Reaction capability create any
      operational problems for recipients?

   o  Does the presence of the Reaction capability demonstrate
      additional security issues?
