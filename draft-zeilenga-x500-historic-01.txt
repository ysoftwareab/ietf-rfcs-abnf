Abstract


Zeilenga            Old X.500 RFCs to Historic Status           [Page 1]
INTERNET-DRAFT     draft-zeilenga-x500-historic-01.txt   23 October 2004

  This document recommends the retirement of various early X.500 and
  LDAP RFCs documents which are no longer relevant to the Internet
  community, except for historical purposes.

1. Introduction

  This document recommends the following old X.500 and LDAP related RFCs
  be moved to Historic status:

    - "Directory Assistance Service" [RFC1202],
    - "DIXIE Protocol Specification" [RFC1249],
    - "Replication Requirements to provide an Internet Directory using
       X.500" [RFC1275],
    - "Replication and Distributed Operations extensions to provide an
       Internet using X.500" [RFC1276],
    - "X.500 and Domains" [RFC1279]
    - "Portable DUAs" [RFC1373]
    - "DUA Metrics" [RFC1431]
    - "A Survey of Advanced Usages of X.500" [RFC1491] (also FYI 21)
    - "DSA Metrics" [RFC1564]
    - "Schema Publishing in X.500 Directory" [RFC1804]
    - "The LDAP Application Program Interface" [RFC1823]
    - "A Revised Catalog of Available X.500 Implementations" [RFC2116]
       (also FYI 11)

  These documents are no longer relevant to the Internet community,
  except for historical purposes.

  Section 2 discusses the rationale for moving each of these documents
  to Historic status.  In many cases, these documents are superceded by
  more recently published RFCs as noted.

2. Rationale

2.1. RFC 1202

  RFC 1202 describes the Directory Assistance Service, a protocol
  designed to provide access to the X.500 directory service through a
  Directory User Agent serving as a gateway.  This protocol is not
  believed to be in use on the Internet.  The protocol is deprecated in
  favor of LDAP.  RFC 1202 is only of historic interest.

  RFC 1202 was published in 1991 as Informational.

2.2. RFC 1249


Zeilenga            Old X.500 RFCs to Historic Status           [Page 2]
INTERNET-DRAFT     draft-zeilenga-x500-historic-01.txt   23 October 2004

  RFC 1249 describes the DIXIE protocol, a protocol designed to provide
  access to the X.500 Directory Service.  The protocol is not believed
  to be in use on the Internet.   DIXIE was deprecated in favor of LDAP.
  RFC 1249 is now only of historical interest.

  RFC 1249 was published in 1991 as Informational.

2.3. RFC 1275

  RFC 1275 discussed deficiencies of the X.500(1998) standard in the
  areas of distributed operations and replication.  These deficiences
  were addressed in subsequent editions of X.500, specifically by
  [X.525] and [X.518].  Readers should read later documents, such as RFC
  3384, to better understand the community requirements in these areas.

  RFC 1275 was published in 1991 as Informational.

2.4. RFC 1276

  RFC 1276 describes "INTERIM" replication and distributed operations
  extensions to X.500(88).  Subsequent editions of X.500 provides
  standard replication [X.525] and distributed operation [X.518]
  mechanisms which are technically superior.  X.500(88) is now obsolete.

  RFC 1276 was published in 1991 as Proposed Standard.

2.5. RFC 1279

  RFC 1279 discusses the relationship between X.500 distinguished names
  and Internet domain names.  This information is superseded by
  [RFC2164] and [RFC2247], both Proposed Standards.

  RFC 1279 was published in 1991 as Experimental.

2.6. RFC 1373

  RFC 1373 comes in two parts.

  The first part provides brief notes on the use of some circa-1992
  Directory User Agents (DUAs):  "WHOIS interface to X.500", ISODE "de",
  DIXIE/UD, and "doog".  These DUAs are defunct, as is the version of
  X.500 in use in 1992.

  The second part provides instructions to ISODE-maintainers wishing to

INTERNET-DRAFT     draft-zeilenga-x500-historic-01.txt   23 October 2004

  provide DUAs to users.  The software referred to as "ISODE" here is
  defunct, as is the version of X.500 that software implemented.

  RFC 1373 was published in 1992 as Informational.

2.7. RFC 1431

  RFC 1431 purpose was to "define some metrics by which DUA products can
  be measured."  RFC 1431 defined "a set of criteria by which a DUA
  implementation [...] may be judged" in the form of a questionaire.
  While this document may have been useful to those judging DUA
  implementations available in the early 1990s, the questionaire's
  usefulness for judging modern DUA implementations is limited.  (Some
  questions, of course, transend time.)

  RFC 1432 was published in 1992 as Informational.

2.8. RFC 1564

  RFC 1564 purpose was to "define some metrics by which DSA products can
  be measured."  RFC 1564 defined "a set of criteria by which a DSA
  implementation [...] may be judged" in the form of a questionaire.
  While this document may have been useful to those judging DUA
  implementations available in the early 1990s, the questionaire's
  usefulness for judging modern DSA implementations limited.  (Some
  questions, of course, transend time.)

  RFC 1564 was published in 1994 as Informational.

2.9. RFC 1804

  RFC 1804 described an experimental mechanism for publishing and
  distributing schema for information in the Directory.  Modern versions
  of X.500 and LDAP provide standardized mechanisms for publishing and
  distributing schema information.

  RFC 1804 was published in 1995 as Experimental.

2.10. RFC 1823

  RFC 1823 defined a C language application programming interface (API)
  to for use in implementing LDAPv2 clients [RFC1777][RFC3494].  While
  LDAP client libaries of yesterday and today provide similar APIs, the
  provided APIs do significantly differ.  Hence, developers needing

INTERNET-DRAFT     draft-zeilenga-x500-historic-01.txt   23 October 2004

  information about the API provided by their library of choice, must
  reply on the library's documentation, not this definition.  This is
  especially true for modern clients using modern libraries.

  RFC 1823 was published in 1995 as Informational.

2.11. RFC 2116

  RFC 2116 provided a catalog of available X.500 implementations.  This
  purpose of publishing this catalog was "to provide an easily
  accessible source of information on X.500 implementations for those
  who wish to consider X.500 technology for deploying a Directory
  service."  However, as this the catalog was compiled prior to the
  introduction of LDAPv3 and currently in-force editions of X.500, it no
  longer a suitable source of information about currently available
  X.500 implementations.  Those wishing to consider X.500 technology for
  deploying a Directory service should consider modern implementations.

  RFC 2116 was published in 1997 as Informational, and as FYI 11.

3. Security Considerations

  The security of the Internet will not be impacted by the retirement of
  these specifications.

4. IANA Considerations

  The port number (96) allocated to the DIXIE protocol should be
  returned to the pool of available port numbers.

5. Acknowledgment

  The author would like to thank the developers of these specifications
  for their contribution to the Internet community.
