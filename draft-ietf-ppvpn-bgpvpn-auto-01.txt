Abstract 
    
   In any Network-Based VPN (NBVPN) scheme, the Provider Edge (PE) 
   routers attached to a common VPN must exchange certain information 
   as a prerequisite to establish VPN-specific connectivity. In 
   [RFC2547-bis], VPN-specific routes are exchanged, along with the 
   information needed to enable a PE to determine which routes belong 
   to which VPNs. In [VPN-VR], VR addresses must be exchanged, along 
   with the information needed to enable the PEs to determine which VRs 
   are in the same VPN ("membership"), and which of those VRs are to 
   have VPN connectivity ("topology"). Once the VRs are reachable 
   through the tunnels, routes ("reachability") are then exchanged by 
   running existing routing protocol per VPN basis. The purpose of this 
   draft is to define a common BGP based auto-discovery mechanism used 
   for both the virtual router [VPN-VR] and [RFC2547-bis] 
   architectures. Each scheme uses the mechanism to automatically 
   discover the information needed by that particular scheme. 
   Interworking scenarios between [RFC2547-bis] and the virtual router 
   models are also discussed.

1. Introduction 
 
   In any Network-Based VPN (NBVPN) scheme, the Provider Edge (PE) 
   routers attached to a common VPN must exchange certain information 
   as a prerequisite to establish VPN-specific connectivity. In 
   [RFC2547-bis], VPN-specific routes are exchanged, along with the 
   information needed to enable a PE to determine which routes belong 
   to which VPNs. In [VPN-VR], virtual router (VR) addresses must be 
   exchanged, along with the information needed to enable the PEs to 
   determine which VRs are in the same VPN ("membership"), and which of 
   those VRs are to have VPN connectivity ("topology"). Once the VRs 
   are reachable through the tunnels, routes ("reachability") are then 
   exchanged by running existing routing protocols per VPN basis.  
    
   The purpose of this draft is to define a common BGP based auto-
   discovery mechanism used for both the virtual router [VPN-VR] and 
   [RFC2547-bis] architectures. Each scheme uses the mechanism to 
   automatically discover the information needed by that particular 
   scheme. The BGP multiprotocol extension attributes are used to carry 
   either the virtual router or the RFC2547 auto-discovery information. 
   Interworking scenarios between [RFC2547-bis] and the virtual router 
   models are also discussed.   
    
    
    
2. Network Based VPNs Reference Model 
    
   Both the virtual router and [RFC2547-bis] architectures are using a 
   network reference model as illustrated in figure 1.

                Figure 1: Network based VPN Reference Model 
     
 
   It is assumed that the PE routers can use BGP to distribute 
   information to each other. This may be via direct IBGP peering, via  
   direct EBGP peering, via multihop BGP peering, through 
   intermediaries such as Route Reflectors, through a chain of 
   intermediate BGP connections, etc. It is assumed also that the PE 
   knows what architecture it is supporting (either the virtual router, 
   or [RFC2547-bis] architectures, or both). 
   
 
3. Carrying VPN information in BGP Multi-Protocol Extension Attributes 
 
   The BGP-4 multiprotocol extensions are used to carry various 
   information about VPNs for both architectures. This is done as 
   follows.  The NLRI is a VPN-IP address or a labeled VPN-IP address. 
   VPN-specific information associated with the NLRI is encoded either 
   as attributes of the NLRI, or as part of the NLRI itself, or both.   
    
   The address prefix in the NLRI field is ALWAYS within the VPN 
   address space, and therefore MUST be unique within the VPN. The 
   address specified in the BGP next hop attribute, on the other hand, 
   is in the service provider addressing space. 
    
   In the case of the virtual router, the NLRI address prefix is an 
   address of one of the virtual routers configured on the PE. Thus 
   this mechanism allows the virtual routers to discover each other, to 
   set up adjacencies and tunnels to each other, etc. In the case of 
   [RFC2547-bis], the NLRI prefix represents a route to an arbitrary 
   system or set of systems within the VPN. 
    
    
4. Interpretation of VPN Information in the [RFC2547-bis] model 
    
   The [RFC2547-bis] model interprets the NLRI reachability 
   information. The BGP attributes (in particular, the Route Target 
   Extended Community) are used by the PE routers to assign the routes 
   to particular VPN database/processing contexts, and hence implicitly 
   determine the topology. The BGP Next Hop attribute specifies the 
   remote end point of the tunnel to be used when sending packets whose 
   destination addresses match the corresponding NLRI. For details, see 
   [RFC2547-bis]. 
    
5. Interpretation of VPN Information in the [VPN-VR] model 
    
5.1 Membership Discovery 
    
   The VPN-ID format as defined in [RFC-2685] is used to identify a 
   VPN. All virtual routers that are members of a specific VPN share 
   the same VPN-ID. A VPN-ID is carried in the NLRI to make addresses 
   of VRs globally unique. Making these addresses globally unique is 
   necessary if one uses BGP for VRs' autodiscovery.

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-ppvpn-bgpvpn-auto-01.txt    November 2001 
 
 
    
    
5.1.1 Encoding of the VPN-ID in the NLRI 
    
   For the virtual router model, the VPN-ID is carried within the route 
   distinguisher (RD) field. In order to hold the 7-bytes VPN-ID, the 
   first byte of RD type field is used to indicate the existence of the 
   VPN-ID format. A value of 0x80 in the first byte of RD's type field 
   indicates that the RD field is carrying the VPN-ID format. In this 
   case, the type field range 0x8000-0x80ff will be reserved for the 
   virtual router case. 
    
    
5.1.2 VPN-ID Extended Community 
    
   A new extended community is used to carry the VPN-ID format. This 
   attribute is transitive across the Autonomous system boundary. The 
   type field of the VPN-ID extended community is of regular type to be 
   assigned by IANA [BGP-COMM]. The remaining 7 bytes hold the VPN-ID 
   value field as per [RFC-2685]. The BGP UPDATE message will carry 
   information for a single VPN. It is the VPN-ID Extended Community, 
   or more precisely route filtering based on the Extended Community 
   that allows one VR to find out about other VRs in the same VPN.  
 
 
 
 
5.2 VPN Topology Information 
    
   A new extended community is used to indicate different VPN topology 
   values. This attribute is transitive across the Autonomous system 
   boundary. The value of the type field for extended type is assigned 
   by IANA. The first two bytes of the value field (of the remaining 6 
   bytes) are reserved. The actual topology values are carried within 
   the remaining four bytes. The following topology values are defined: 
    
         Value    Topology Type 
    
           1          "Hub" 
           2          "Spoke" 
           3          "Mesh" 
    
   Arbitrary values can also be used to allow specific topologies to be 
   constructed. VPN connectivity between two VRs within the same VPN is 
   achieved if and only if at least one of them is a hub (the other is 
   a hub or a spoke), or if both VRs are part of a full mesh VPN 
   topology.  
 
 
5.3  Tunnel Discovery 
    

 
Ould-Brahim, et al.             November 2001                  [Page 5] 
Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-ppvpn-bgpvpn-auto-01.txt    November 2001 
 
   Network-based VPNs must be implemented through some form of 
   tunneling mechanism, where the packet formats and/or the addressing 
   used within the VPN can be unrelated to that used to route the 
   tunneled packets across the backbone. There are numerous tunneling 
   mechanisms that can be used by a network based VPN (e.g., IP/IP 
   [RFC-2003], GRE tunnels [RFC-1701], IPSec [RFC-2401], and MPLS 
   tunnels [MPLS-ARCH]). Each of these tunnels allows for opaque 
   transport of frames as packet payload across the backbone, with 
   forwarding disjoint from the address fields of the encapsulated 
   packets. A provider edge router may terminate multiple type of 
   tunnels and forward packets between these tunnels and other network 
   interfaces in different ways. 
    
   BGP can be used to carry tunnel endpoint addresses between edge 
   routers. For scalability purposes, this draft recommends the use of 
   tunneling mechanisms with demultiplexing capabilities such as IPSec, 
   MPLS, and GRE (with respect to using GRE -the key field, it is no 
   different than just MPLS over GRE, however there is no specification 
   on how to exchange the key field, while there is a specification and 
   implementations on how to exchange the label). Note that IP in IP 
   doesn't have demultiplexing capabilities. 
    
    
   The BGP next hop will carry the service provider tunnel endpoint 
   address. As an example, if IPSec is used as tunneling mechanism, the 
   IPSec tunnel remote address will be discovered through BGP, and the 
   actual tunnel establishment is achieved through IPSec signaling 
   protocol.  
    
   When MPLS tunneling is used, the label carried in the NLRI field is 
   associated with an address of a VR, where the address is carried in 
   the NLRI and is encoded as a VPN-IP address. 
 
 
6. Virtual Router and [RFC2547-bis] Interworking Scenarios 
 
   Two interwoking scenarios are considered when the network is using 
   both virtual routers and [RFC2547-bis]. The first scenario is a CE-
   PE relationship between a PE (implementing [RFC2547-bis]), and a VR 
   appearing as a CE to the PE. The connection between the VR, and the 
   PE can be either direct connectivity, or through a tunnel (e.g., 
   IPSec).  
    
   The second scenario is when a PE is implementing both architectures. 
   In this particular case, a single BGP session configured on the 
   service provider network can be used to advertise either [RFC2547-
   bis] VPN information or the virtual router related VPN information. 
   From the VR and the [RFC2547-bis] point of view there is complete 
   separation from data path and addressing schemes. However the PE's 
   interfaces are shared between both architectures. 
    
   A PE implementing only [RFC2547-bis] will not import routes from a 
   BGP UPDATE message containing the VPN-ID extended community. On the 
 
Ould-Brahim, et al.             November 2001                  [Page 6] 
Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-ppvpn-bgpvpn-auto-01.txt    November 2001 
 
   other hand, a PE implementing the virtual router architecture will 
   not import routes from a BGP UPDATE message containing the route 
   target extended community attribute. 
    
   The granularity at which the information is either [RFC2547-bis] 
   related or VR-related is per BGP UPDATE message. Different SAFI 
   numbers are used to indicate that the message carried in BGP 
   multiprotocol extension attributes is to be handled by the VR or 
   [RFC2547-bis] architectures. SAFI number of 128 is used for [RFC2547-
   bis] related format. A value of 129 for the SAFI number is for the 
   virtual router (where the NLRI are carrying a labeled prefixes), and 
   a SAFI value of 140 is for non labeled addresses. 
 
 
7. Use of BGP Capability Advertisement 
    
   A BGP speaker that uses VPN information as described in this 
   document with multiprotocol extensions should use the Capability 
   Advertisement procedures to determine whether the speaker could use 
   Multiprotocol Extensions with a particular peer. The Capability Code 
   field is set to 1 (which indicates Multiprotocol Extensions 
   capabilities).  
    
    
8. Security Considerations 
    
   This draft does not introduce any new security considerations to 
   either [VPN-VR] or [RFC2547-bis].
