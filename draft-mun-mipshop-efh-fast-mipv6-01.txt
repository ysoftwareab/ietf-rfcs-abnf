Abstract

   In MIPv6 [1], whenever a mobile node changes its attached point, handover
   process should be followed to inform its home agent and correspondent
   of a MN's current location. The handover process is decomposed into
   layer 2 and layer 3 handovers again, and these two handovers are
   accomplished sequentially, which causes long latency problem. This
   problem is a critical issue in MIPv6. To make up for this, we propose

   an enhanced Fast Handover scheme to reduce the overall latency on
   handover, revising the Fast Handover [2]. Especially, several 
   messages in layer 3 are sent in one frame during layer 2 handover.

1. Introduction

   As the advancement of wireless communication, requirements on the
   wireless Internet and mobility support are increasing. To support
   mobility, Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) [1] has been proposed by the Internet
   Engineering Task Force (IETF). In MIPv6, when a mobile node (MN)
   moves to other subnetwork, it needs certain process, a handover,
   which causes long latency problem. There have been many researches to
   reduce the handover latency in MIPv6, such as a Fast Handover [2] and
   a hierarchical MIPv6 [3]. Still, aforementioned mechanisms are not
   appropriate to satisfy real-time traffic. We propose a enhanced fast
   handover scheme (EFH) to reduce the handover latency, modified from
   the Fast Handover scheme based on IEEE 802.11 [4].

   In the Fast Handover, handover latency is smaller than the one of
   MIPv6, and packets from a CN to the MN are not lost during the
   handover because a tunnel is formed between a previous access router
   (PAR) and a new access router (NAR) before the layer 2 handover, and
   the NAR will buffer packets destined to the MN through the tunnel.
   The Fast Handover scheme, however, needs more signal packets and
   buffering. In the EFH, handover latency and signal packets are
   reduced than the Fast Handover due to multiple signal packets in one
   frame.

3. Background Information

3.1. IEEE 802.11

   IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN is the layer 2 protocol and supports
   mobility in a link layer level. IEEE 802.11 handover takes place when
   a MN changes its association from one access point (AP) to another
   and its process consists of a search phase and an execution phase.
   This handover process simply consists of the following steps [5]: 
 
   a. The MN realizes that a handoff is necessary due to degrading radio
      transmission environment for the current AP.    

   b. Search Phase
      The MN performs a scan to see what APs are available. The result
      of the scan is a list of APs together with physical layer
      information, such as signal strength. The MN chooses one of the
      APs and performs a join to synchronize its physical and MAC layer
      timing parameters with the selected AP.
 
   c. Execution Phase
      1. Authentiation phase
      The MN requests authentication with the new AP.  For an "Open
      System", such authentication is a single round-trip message
      exchange with null authentication.
      2. Association phase
      The MN requests association or reassociation with the new AP.
      A reassociation request contains the MAC layer address of the old
      AP, while a plain association request does not.

   At the association(reassociation) phase, the MN's link layer is
   really connected to the NAP. In some 802.11 implementations, the scan
   performs far in advance of the handover and perhaps in advance of any
   realtime traffic. [5]


3.2. Fast Handover

   In MIPv6, when a MN moves from one subnet to another subnet, a
   certain process is needed such as a handover. The handover consists
   of layer 2 and layer 3 handovers which are physical and logical
   handovers, respectively. In the Fast Handover, two handovers are
   interleaved to reduce a handover latency.

   The Fast Handover is a scheme which improves MIPv6 handover. In the
   Fast Handover, there are two modes, such as predictive and reactive
   mode. In this draft, we only explain and use the predictive mode. In
   the Fast Handover, several portions of the layer 3 handover are

   performed prior to the layer 2 handover. In other words, the MN
   performs the layer 3 handover while it connected to a PAR, and in
   this case, the PAR must have information about destined AR. The PAR
   establishes a tunnel between itself and a NAR and verifies MN's NCoA
   through exchanging a handover initiate (HI) message and a handover
   acknowledge (HAck) message. Packets that arrive at previous care-of
   address (PCoA) are sent to the NAR through an established tunnel
   during the handover. The tunnel is kept until MN's NCoA is registered
   to a HA.

       Fig. 1. MIPv6 fast handover Scheme (FMIPv6) - Predictive mode


   Fig. 1 shows the Fast Handover scheme. The MN initiates the Fast
   Handover scheme when a layer 2 trigger take places. The MN sends an
   RtSolPr message to the PAR and receives a PrRtAdv messages for
   information of the NAR. The MN creates the NCoA and sends a FBU
   message with the NCoA. The PAR receives the FBU message, then sends a
   HI message and receives a HAck message to verify the NCoA in the NAR
   and to establish a tunnel between the PAR and the NAR. The PAR sends
   FBack messages to the MN and the NAR, respectively after verification
   of the NCoA. The MN performs the layer 2 handover when it receives
   the FBack message. The MN sends a FNA message to NAR to inform its
   movement after the layer 2 handover. Then the MN exchanges a BU and a
   BA with the HA to register the NCoA. A Return Routability procedure
   is performed between the MN and the CN to establish security
   association, and then the MN sends Binding Update message to the CN.

   After registration, the handover is finished.


3.3. A scheme using Fast Handover based on IEEE 802.11

   The Fast Handover based on IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN has been studied.
   [5] shows a order that layer 2 and layer 3 handover processes are
   performed when the layer 2 protocol is the IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN
   and the layer 3 protocol is the MIPv6 Fast Handover. [7] has been
   proposed by Y. Mun and J. Kim to improve the Fast Handover. They
   thought a scheme that mingles the layer 3 handover with the layer 3
   handover, and propose that a MN encapsulates a BU message to HA in a
   layer 2 frame during layer 2 handover to reduce the handover latency.
   In this scheme, APs and a MN must have ability which can encapsulate
   and decapsulate an information element (IE) [6].


4. Proposed Protocol (Enhanced Fast Handover, EFH) Details
   
   When a MN moves into another network, a handover process should be
   followed not to lose connectivity. The handover process consists of a
   layer 2 and a layer 3 handovers. The layer 2 handover processes a
   scan phase, authentication phase and association phase. The layer 3
   handover is decomposed into creating, verifying and registering a
   new address. The layer 2 and layer 3 handovers are performed
   sequentially in MIPv6 while several messages related to layer 3
   handover are exchanged prior the layer 2 handover and the rest of the
   layer 3 handover in the Fast Handover. To perform the Fast Handover,
   several signal messages are needed. These additional messages make
   network traffic and use node's resources. In the EFH, the MN sends
   one frame containing several signal messages related to layer 3
   handover during the layer 2 handover. Therefore, the EFH can register
   a new address to HA and CN more quickly than the Fast Handover.
   Figure 1 shows messages of the EFH.

   We assume that the MN must be able to encapsulate a BU destined to
   HA,a HoTI and a CoTI messages to an 802.11 reassociation request
   frame. A NAP is assumed to decapsulate the 802.11 reassociation
   request frame and to forward the BU message to HA, the HoTI and the
   CoTI messages to CN. The EFH only can be performed when the fast
   handover is the predictive mode. Otherwise, the MN performs a MIPv6
   handover (or the reactive mode of the Fast Handover). IPsec mechanism
   is employed between the MN and the HA, using current security
   association (SA) when the MN sends the BU message to HA and the HoTI
   message to CN.

              Figure 1: The enhanced fast handover scheme (EFH)


   The EFH detail is as follows:
   Once authentication phase in the layer 2 handover is completed
   successfully, reas-sociation phase starts. A MN sends an 802.11
   reassociation request frame, which contains three messages that are
   performed after the layer 2 handover; a BU, a home test init (HoTI)
   and a care-of test init (CoTI) messages. Source address of layer 3
   handover messages is a NCoA. Once a NAP receives the reassociation
   request frame, it decapsulates that frame and forwards three
   messages. Finally the BU message gets to the HA via the NAR and HoTI
   and CoTI messages get to CN via the NAR. The rest of handover process
   is very similar to the Fast Handover.

5. Message Formats

   To be defined.


6. Security Considerations

   In this draft, the security between a MN and a AR does not specify
   any particular mechanism to convey information between the MN and AR
   the set of information identified in the following internet draft,
   can be conveyed between the MN and the AR in a different suitable
   manner outside the scope of this document (e.g. ICMP, the protocol
   defined by the PANA WG, etc.).


7. Conclusions

   In the MIPv6, handover latency is a critical issue. To solve this
   problem, R. Koodli has proposed the Fast Handover which reduces
   handover latency in the MIPv6. Still, this scheme is not appropriate
   to satisfy real-time traffic, since . We propose an enhanced fast handover
   scheme (EFH) to reduce the overall latency on the handover, revising
   the Fast Handover. Especially, several messages related to the layer
   3 handover are sent in one frame during layer 2 handover.

   Currently, the Fast Handover scheme is being standardized in IETF,
   and then will soon be a RFC document. The EFH scheme improves the
   Fast Handover, using layer 2 handover frame. Therefore, if EFH scheme
   is used with the Fast Handover sheme, a handover performance will be
   improved.
