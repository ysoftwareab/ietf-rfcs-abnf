              Use Case for Distributed Data Center in SUPA
                   draft-cheng-supa-ddc-use-cases-06

Abstract

   Large scale DCs can provide various services and usually have a lot
   of internal and external links, and these links are usually VPNs.
   The Service provisioning and network connectivity configurations are
   complex and sometimes dynamic, for which manual configuration is not
   suitable.  This draft analyzes the use case in Distributed Data
   Centers (DDC), in which some VPN scenarios are covered, and the
   applicability of Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) data
   models which can be used for better and automated resource usage and
   easy service/network configuration.

1.  Introduction

   The SUPA (Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions) work aims at
   providing data models, including topology data models, network
   service specific data models, policy data models, to easily,
   accurately, and efficiently select and use the available
   communication network capabilities.  An example of the data model can
   be found in [I-D.zaalouk-supa-configuration-model].  Service Manager
   (SM) is used by an a communications service provider and/or operator
   to deploy and manage services on top of network facilities.  An
   example of SM is a set of applications used by an Operational Support
   System (OSS) entity to perform network configuration.  Several SUPA
   use cases have been introduced in the problem statement document.
   This document reviews various scenarios for Distributed Data Center
   (DDC) use case.

   Take a large-scale Distributed Data Center (DDC) operator as an
   example, it provides server hosting, leased line, value-added

   services to enterprises and ISPs, and has more than 10 data centers
   using over one Tbps of bandwidth in a capital city.  In this IDC
   network, traffic at each site is routed via configuring policy routes
   and adjusting routes prioritization to choose an outgoing link.  This
   type of static provisioning comes with high costs and poor
   operability.  Furthermore, the link bandwidth resources in the data
   centers are not efficiently utilized.

   In quite some of the scenarios, the links between DCs are VPNs,
   including L2VPN, L3VPN, etc.  SUPA will be mainly used for those VPN
   configurations.  Although there may be some cases where physical
   links are used, but those are out of the scope of this draft.

   DC and network may belong to different operators.  If a DC operator
   needs to configure network connectivity for DCs, it may need to
   cooperate with network operators providing such connectivity.
   Network operators can define and provide data models to enable this.

   This document illustrates several distributed datacenter (DDC)
   applications and explains how an operator could use SUPA to provide
   these applications.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   The terminology used in the SUPA problem statement draft

   VAS       Value Added Service

   VPC       Virtual Private Cloud (PC)

4.  Challenges Faced by Data Center ISPs

   There are many challenges in traditional data centers:

   1) infrastructure and network link is usually leased, depending on
   manual planning and design, which leads to low resource usage and
   high cost.  In consequence, the operator that rent these resources
   has to offer SUPA data models for facilitating control of them (for
   instance, by the DC operator).

   2) Service expansion is limited in a single physical DC.  Each DC
   resource is isolated, so service and resource can only be deployed in
   one single DC.

   3) VAS (Value Added Service) is provisioned via static configuration,
   which brings complex training, long service TTM time and poor
   flexibility.  This could not meet the requirements of complex use
   cases, e.g., lot of VAS devices, significant differences between
   various services.

5.  SUPA Benefits

   In quite some cases, DC oprators need to optimize and automate
   service deployment for them serlfves or for customers.  While in some
   cases, DC tenants also need to perform some optimization, e.g. a vDC
   tennant may want traffic steering to make full use of links.  To
   solve the above challenges for data center oerators and tenants, SUPA
   could be applied in the following ways:

   o  SUPA supports an open network architecture: standardizaed data
      models enable an open architecture and make it possible for
      unified service / network planning, which can interconnect with
      third party cloud platform, supporting fast service innovation.

   o  SUPA supports overall DC resource integration: SUPA data models
      can be used for network resource virtualization; inter-DC
      resource, virtual DC (vDC) resource, etc, can be integrated and
      controlled by a centralized functional entity.

   o  SUPA supports automatic E2E service delivery: Network (including
      virtual network), computing, inter-DC management of storage

      resource, automatic service delivery, automatic VPN connection
      configurations between DCs, which improves operation efficiency.

   o  SUPA contributes to improve DDC network usage by means of
      Intelligent scheduling of DDC traffic, improving link usage.

   o  SUPA supports VAS service on-demand provisioning automatically:
      Create or delete VAS nodes on-demand, based on various service
      requirements; network forwarding policy based on the VAS routing,
      to achieve automatic draining and automatic configuration of VAS
      device policy.

   Please refer to [I-D.zhou-supa-framework] and other SUPA related
   documents for more details of SUPA features.

   The following sections will illustrate three typical cases in
   distributed data center which could benefit from SUPA architecture.

6.  Scenarios

   In the following uses, Service Manager (SM) is used for service and
   policy definition; and Network Manager (Controller) is used for
   network topology maintenance and mapping data models to detail
   network configruations, as defined in [I-D.zhou-supa-framework].

                      Scenario:Inter DC Connectivity

   There can be a lot of links between data centers.  Configuration of
   these links is complex.  As shown in Figure 1, service data models
   and policy data models can be defined to automate the configuration
   procedures.  The service data model for connectivity will specify
   attributes of (virtual) links, e.g. the end points of links,
   bandwidth, QoS and availability parameters, etc.  The policy model
   can specify some high level requirements to the links, like routing
   strategy (via and not via) and price/cost strategy.  The policy data
   model can also define the policy rules that drive the security
   requirements.

   Inter DC connections can be classified into two types: connections
   within a single administrative domain and connections across multiple
   administrative domains.  Links d1, d2 and d3 are within an
   administrative domain; and links a1, a2 and 3 are across domains.
   The difference between them is that connections across multiple
   administrative domain require extra negotiation and authentication/
   authorization, which can be achieved via communications between SMs.
   Data models for this purpose should also be defined.

   The links interconnecting two DCs together should guarantee a minimum
   bandwidth, certain QoS parameters, and provide availability
   guarantees.  As a service policy example in Figure 1, for traffic
   from DC2 to DC-B, if the load on a link exceeds a threshold (e.g.,
   90%), some (new) traffic can be redirect to another link.

                         Scenario:vDC Connectivity

   A DC tenant may have resources, e.g. network, computing, storage,
   etc, in multiple physical DCs.  DC operators will provide internal
   network connectivity for these distributed resources, and make it
   look like one seamless entity, which can be called as virtual DC
   (vDC).

   The internal links for vDC can be implemented via tunneling overlay
   technologies, e.g.  VPN or VxLAN, etc.  The tunnels need to be
   dynamically established, managed and released.

   As show in Figure 2, service data model and policy data model can be
   defined to automate the links configuration for vDCs.  A policy model
   should specify the attributes of the tunnels, e.g., bandwidth, QoS
   and availability parameters, the interaction with policy systems that
   dynamically scale the DC resources assigned to a tenant, and the
   policy rules that drive the prioritization of resource assignments.
   The networking resources assigned to a tenant should scale
   proportionally to the compute resources assigned to a tenant.  The
   traffic should be prioritized to resources owned by tenants that
   offer interactive services according to the time zone the DC is
   located in.

6.3.  Scenario:Dynamic Link Configuration for DC

   Static and over provisioning for DC links is not always a good
   solution.  Sometimes dynamic configuration is necessary.

                Scenario:Dynamic Link Configuration for DC

   One case is virtual machine migration and large amount of data
   transfer between DCs.  But this kind of activity does not happen
   frequently.  A dedicated link with constant bandwidth for this
   purpose is too expensive.  The network operator should allow the DC
   operator to create a link on demand when necessary.  This link may

   have large bandwidth but last for a limited time period.  An
   alternative is to create short-term dedicated links for backups and
   migrations.

   As shown in figure 3, data models can help to automate these kind of
   configurations.  In the data models, the attributes of links
   (bandwidth, QoS and availability parameters) should be specified.
   The policy concerning strict and soft bounds on the lifetime of such
   links, and the policy concerning the scheduling of dedicated links
   (e.g., based on the current load) and the services using the
   dedicated links can also be specified.

   When the traffic volume between DCs exceeds a certain threshold, the
   policy-driven service manager requests that traffic schedules may be
   adjusted within bounds in order to balance load on the links (e.g.,
   delay backups and migrations until the network has the necessary
   capacity).

                     Scenario: VPC to DC Connectivity

   As virtualization technology becomes more and more popular, some
   organizations and companies now begin to use cloud platform to
   support their computer desktop, rather than using physical personal
   computers and workstations.  The kind of cloud platform can be a
   commercial solution, e.g.  Amazon's cloud platform.  VPCs at cloud
   service providers' DC may keep on running for a long time even if no
   user is actually accessing it; but the cloud platform may bring VPCs
   into power saving mode when there is little or no load in it.

   The organizations and companies, e.g. a university, sometimes provide
   some internal services like database which is only available to the




Cheng, et al.            Expires October 4, 2015               [Page 11]

   VPC but not available to users in the public network.  These kind of
   services can be located in an cloud operator's DC.

   The VPC and the internal services sometimes are located in different
   DCs, or even provided by different vendors.  VPNs are configured for
   the VPCs to provide connection to the internal services, and to
   create and manage VPNs to internal services.  The access of virtual
   PCs to data resources is often controlled by underlying projects.

   As shown in figure 4, service data models and policy data models can
   be defined to automate the configurations of links between VPC and DC
   where service is located.  The data models should specify the policy
   controlling authentication and authorization concerning access to
   data residing in internal services.  During the duration of project
   X, ensure that the virtual PCs used by the project members have
   secure access to the data resource Y.

7.  Security Considerations

   Security is a key aspect of any protocol that allows state
   installation and extracting of detailed configuration states.  More
   investigation remains to fully define the security requirements, such
   as authorization and authentication levels.

8.  IANA Considerations

   Not applicable.
