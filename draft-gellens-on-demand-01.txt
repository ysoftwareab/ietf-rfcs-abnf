Introduction

    With the spread of low-cost computer systems and Internet
    connectivity, the demand for local mail servers had been rising.
    Many people now want to operate a mail server on a system which has
    only an intermittent connection to a service provider.  If the
    system has a static IP address, the [ESMTP] [ETRN] command can be
    used.  However, systems with dynamic IP addresses (which are very
    common with low-cost connections) have no good solution.

Internet Draft              On-Demand Mail Relay              March 1998


    This memo proposes a new service, On-Demand Mail Relay, which is a
    profile of [ESMTP], providing for a secure, extensible, easy to
    implement approach to the problem.


1.  Conventions Used in this Document

    Because the client and server roles reverse during the session, to
    avoid confusion, the terms "customer" and "provider" will be used
    in place of "client" and "server", although of course this protocol
    may be useful in cases other than commercial service providers and
    customers.

    In examples, "P:" is used to indicate lines sent by the provider,
    and "C:" indicates those sent by the customer.  Line breaks within
    a command are for editorial purposes only.

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY"
    in this document are to be interpreted as defined in [KEYWORDS].


2.  Description

    On-Demand Mail Relay is a restricted profile of SMTP which runs on
    port xxxx.  The initial client and server roles are short-lived, as
    the point is to allow the intermittently-connected host to request
    mail held for it by a service provider.

    The customer initiates a connection to the provider, authenticates,
    and requests its mail.  The roles of client and server then
    reverse, and normal [ESMTP] proceeds.

    The provider has an On-Demand Mail Relay process listening for
    connections on port xxxx.  This process does not need to be a full
    SMTP server.  It does need to be an SMTP client with access to the
    outgoing mail queues, and as a server implement the EHLO, AUTH,
    ATRN, and QUIT commands.

    An MTA normally has a mail client component which processes the
    outgoing mail queues, attempting to send mail for particular
    domains, based on time or event (such as new mail being placed in
    the queue, or receipt of an ETRN command by the SMTP server
    component).  The On-Demand Mail Relay service processes the
    outgoing queue not on a timer or new mail creation, but on request.


3.  States

    The On-Demand Mail Relay service has three states: an initial
    state, an authenticated state, and a reversed state.  The state
    progression is illustrated in the following diagram:

  ---------------------


3.1.  Initial State

    In the initial state, the provider is the server and the customer
    is the client.  Three commands are valid:  EHLO, AUTH, and QUIT.


3.1.1.  EHLO

    The EHLO command is the same as in [ESMTP].  The response must
    include AUTH and ATRN.


3.1.2.  AUTH

    The AUTH command is specified in [AUTH].  The AUTH command uses a
    [SASL] mechanism to authenticate the session.  The session is not
    considered authenticated until a success response to AUTH has been
    sent.

    For interoperability, implementations MUST support the CRAM-MD5
    mechanism [CRAM].  Other SASL mechanisms may be supported.  A site
    MAY disable CRAM-MD5 support if it uses more secure methods.  The
    EXTERNAL mechanism [SASL] might be useful in some cases, for
    example, if the provider has already authenticated the client, such
    as during a PPP connection.

3.1.3.  QUIT

    The QUIT command is the same as in [SMTP].


3.2.  Authenticated State

    The authenticated state is entered after a successful AUTH command.
    Two commands are valid in the authenticated state:  ATRN and QUIT.


3.2.1.  ATRN (Authenticated TURN)

    Unlike the TURN command in [SMTP], the ATRN command optionally
    takes one or more domains as a parameter.  The ATRN command MUST be
    rejected if the session has not been authenticated.  Response code
    503 should be used for this.  The timeout for this command MUST be
    at least 15 minutes to allow the provider time to process its mail
    queue.  An ATRN command sent with no domains is equivalent to an
    ATRN command specifying all domains to which the customer has
    access.  If the authentication used by the customer does not
    provide access to any of the domains specified in ATRN, the
    provider MUST NOT send mail for those domains to the customer; the
    provider MUST reject the ATRN command with a 450 code.  If the
    customer does have access to all of the specified domains, but none
    of them have any queued mail, the provider also rejects the ATRN
    with 450.  If [SMTP-CODES] is used according to [CODES-EXTENSION],
    the provider MUST NOT distinguish between these cases.  If the
    customer has access to all of the specified domains and mail exists
    in at least one of them, the provider issues a 250 success code.

    ABNF for ATRN:

    atrn          ::= "ATRN" [domain *("," domain)]

    domain        ::= sub-domain 1*("." sub-domain)

    sub-domain    ::= (ALPHA / DIGIT) *(ldh-str)

    ldh-str       ::= *(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-") (ALPHA / DIGIT)


3.3.  Reversed State

    After the provider has sent a success reply to the ATRN command,
    the roles reverse, and the customer becomes the server, and the
    provider becomes the client.  At this point normal [ESMTP] commands
    are used.  Typically the provider sends MAIL FROM immediately
    following the success response to ATRN.

3.4.  Other Commands

    The provider SHOULD reject all commands other than EHLO, AUTH,
    ATRN, and QUIT with response code 502.

      C:  250 OK
      P:  RCPT TO: <l.eva.msg@vanity.com>
      C:  250 OK, recipient accepted
