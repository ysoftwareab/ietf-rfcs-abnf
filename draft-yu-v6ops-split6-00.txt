       Separation Protocol of Locator and Identifier Towards IPv6
                        draft-yu-v6ops-split6-00

Abstract

   In the current TCP/IP architecture, the IPv6 address has a dual
   meaning in semantics.  It not only represents the topological
   location of the network node, but also the identity of the node,
   which is usually referred to as the semantic overload problem of the
   IP address.  The semantically overloaded IP address represents the
   topological position of the network, and the topological position of
   the network generally does not move, so the device entering the new
   network environment needs to replace the new identity IP to adapt to
   the change of the topological position.  The semantic overload of IP
   addresses is not conducive to supporting mobility and user identity
   authentication, resulting in tight storage space for routing
   equipment, lack of unified communication identification for network
   equipment, and difficulties in network traceability and management.
   In order to solve the problem of IP address semantic overload, this
   project focuses on the separation technology SPLIT6 of IP address
   identity and location.

1.  Introduction

   In the current Internet architecture, the IPv6 address carries too
   much semantics.  The network layer protocol uses the IPv6 address as
   the location identifier of the user terminal, and the transport layer
   protocol uses the IPv6 address as the identity identifier of the user
   terminal.  This dual identity of the IPv6 address cannot satisfy the
   Internet's increasing mobility and security requirements.

   In order to solve these problems caused by the semantic overload of
   IPv6 addresses, separating the location information and identity
   information of IPv6 addresses has become an important research
   direction.
