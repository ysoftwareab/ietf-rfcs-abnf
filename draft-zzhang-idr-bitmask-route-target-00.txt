                          Bitmask Route Target
                draft-zzhang-idr-bitmask-route-target-00

Abstract

   This document specifies a new type of Route Target called Bitmask
   Route Target as a BGP Community Container.  The key element of a
   Bitmask Route Target is a Bitmask.  Two Bitmask Route Targets are
   considered equivalent for the purpose of controlling route
   propagation (via Route Target Constraints) and importation if the
   result of logical "AND" operation of the Bitmask of the two is non-
   zero.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP

1.  Introduction

   The importation and propagation of BGP routes can be controled using
   Route Targets [RFC4364] and Route Target Constrains [RFC4684].  Both
   relies on comparing two Route Targets based on full match of the
   8-octet encoding.

   There are situations where it is desired to consider two Route
   Targets to be equivalent (hence the route could be imported or
   propagated) as long as certain bits have matching set values.  This
   document defines a new type of Route Target for that purpose.

   An example use case of this Bitmask Route Target is documented in [I-
   D.zzhang-teas-network-slicing-with-flex-te].

   The use of Bitmask Route Target with Route Target Constrains is
   specified separately in [I-D.zzhang-idr-bgp-route-target-constrains-
   extension].

2.  Specification

   The Bitmask Route Target is a Transitive BGP Community Container of
   type TBD [I-D.ietf-idr-wide-bgp-communities].

   The container includes a 1-octet Global Administrator (GA) Type,
   1-octet GA Length, a variable length GA, a 4-octet Local
   Administrator (LA), a 1-octet Bitmask Length in number of octets, and
   the Bitmask.

       |  Global Administrator (variable length)                       ~

       |  Local Administrator                                          |

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The following GA Types and corresponding lengths are defined in this
   document:

   o  TBD1: AS Number, 4-octet

   o  TBD2: IPv4 Address, 4-octet

   o  TBD3: IPv6 Address, 16-octet

   A Bitmask Route Targets A is considered to match Bitmask Route Target
   B for the purpose of controlling propagation and importation of a
   route with an attached Bitmask Route Target B if the following
   conditions are met:

   o  The GA Type, GA Length, GA, and LA fields in A and B match.

   o  The result of the logical "AND" operation of the Bitmask field in
      A and B is not 0.  If A and B have different Bitmask Lengths, the
      smaller one is used to truncate the longer Bitmask.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document does not change security aspects as discussed in
   [RFC4364] and [I-D.ietf-idr-wide-bgp-communities].

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to assign a BGP Community Container Type
   for the Bitmask Route Target from the "BGP Community Container Types"
   registry.

   This document requests IANA to setup a "Bitmask Route Target Global
   Administrator Type Registry" and assign three type values as listed
   in Section 2.  Allocation from the first half of the number is based
   on standardization and allocation from the second half is First Come
   First Serve.
