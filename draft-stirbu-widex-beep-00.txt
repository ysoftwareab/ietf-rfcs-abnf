Abstract

   This document describes a lightweight implementation of a remote user
   interface protocol, compatible with the Widget Description Exchange
   Service (Widex) framework.  The protocol is using the Block
   Extensible Exchange Protocol (BEEP) as the application transport
   substrate for the Widget Description Exchange Service.

Internet-Draft                 Widex-BEEP                      June 2006


1.  Introduction and Motivation

   The proposal in this document describes the Widex application
   transport binding that uses BEEP [2].  Requirements for Widex
   Framework and the specification in this document are outlined in
   Internet-Draft Widex Requirements [4].

   The choice of BEEP as the transport protocol substrate is primarily
   driven by the need to reuse an existing, well-understood protocol
   with all the necessary features to support the requirements,
   particularly for peer-to-peer networks where is no need to bypass
   firewalls.  The secondary reason is that BEEP offers two-way
   multiplexed communication that leads to reduced negotiation and
   network resource usage, criteria that is important for constrained
   devices for which it will be too costly to implement an alternative
   solution based around HTTP [9], ECMAScript [10] and XMLHttpRequest
   Object [11].  This would give the implementers a wealth of toolkits
   and debugging gear for use in constructing both Widex Servers and
   Widex Renderers.


2.  BEEP Profile Identification

   The BEEP profile for Widex is identified as

      http://iana.org/beep/widex

   in the BEEP "profile" element during channel creation.

   In BEEP, when the first channel is successfully created, the
   "serverName" attribute in the "start" element identifies the "virtual
   host" associated with the peer acting in the server role, e.g.

   <start number='1' serverName='applicationserver.example.com'>
       <profile uri='http//iana.org/beep/widex' />
   </start>

2.1.  Profile Initialisation

   The initialisation is used for identifying that each channel bound to
   the BEEP profile for Widex provides access to a single application on
   the Widex Server.

   The DTD syntax for the ready message and its response are:

   <!ELEMENT  ready           EMPTY>
   <!ATTRLIST ready
              application     CDATA           #REQUIRED>

   <!ELEMENT  proceed         EMPTY>

   The ready message contains a mandatory "application" attribute, which
   identifies the application who's user interface is exported by the
   Widex Server.

   If the peer acting in the server role recognises the requested
   resource, it replies with a proceed response.

   C: MSG 0 1 . 52 158
   C: Content-Type: application/beep+xml
   C:
   C: <start number='1' serverName='applicationserver.example.com'>
   C:     <profile uri='http//iana.org/beep/widex'>
   C:         <![CDATA[<ready application='ApplicationName' />]]>
   C: </start>
   C: END

   S:
   S: <profile uri='http//iana.org/beep/widex'>
   S:     <![CDATA[<proceed />]]>
   S: </profile>

   Otherwise, it the ready message is improperly formed, or if the
   requested application isn't recognised, the peer acting in the server
   role replies with an error message.

3.  Widex Message Packages

   The BEEP profile for Widex transmits Widex messages encoded as UTF-8
   using the media type of "application/xml" according to RFC 3023 [6].


4.  Widex Message Patterns

   The BEEP profile for Widex has a one-to-one message pattern.

   Each Widex Message is send using a "MSG" message, containing a valid
   Widex XML instance, and MUST be acknowledged when received completely
   by an empty "RPY" message.


5.  URL Schemes

   This memo defines two URL schemes, "widex.beep" and "widex.beeps"
   which identify the use of Widex over BEEP over TCP.

5.1.  The widex.beep URL Scheme

   The "widex.beep" URL scheme uses the "generic URI" syntax defined in
   Section 3 of RFC 2396 [7], specifically:

   o  the value "widex.beep" is used for the scheme component
   o  the server-based naming authority defined in Section 3.2.2 of [7]
      is used for the authority component
   o  the path component maps to the "application" component of the boot
      message sent during the profile initialisation (if absent, it
      defaults to "/").

Internet-Draft                 Widex-BEEP                      June 2006


   The values of values of both the scheme and authority components are
   case-insensitive.

   For example, the URL

      widex.beep://applicationserver.example.com/ApplicationName

   might result in the example shown in Section 2.1.

5.2.  The widex.beeps URL Scheme

   The "widex.beeps" URL scheme is identical to the "widex.beep" URL
   scheme specified in Section 5.1, with the exception that prior to
   starting the BEEP profile for Widex, the BEEP session must be tunned
   for privacy.

   There are two ways to perform privacy tuning on a BEEP session:

   o  a transport security profile is successfully started;
   o  a user authentication profile that supports transport security is
      successfully started.

   Regardless of the method used, upon completion of the negotiation
   process, a tuning reset occurs in which both BEEP peers issue a new
   greeting.


6.  BEEP Mapping

   The mapping of Widex in this document is specific to RFC 3080 [2].
   This mapping MUST use TCP as specified by RFC 3081 [3].


7.  Registrations

7.1.  BEEP Profile Registration

   Profile Identification: http://iana.org/beep/widex

   Messages exchanged during Channel Creation: ready

   Messages starting one-to-one exchanges: ready, Widex XML instance

   Messages in positive replies: proceed

   Messages in negative replies: error

   Messages in one-to-many replies: none

8.  IANA Considerations

   Registrations with IANA are described in Section 7.


9.  Security Considerations

   Implementers should be fully aware of the security considerations
   given by Widex Framework [5], BEEP [2], and TLS [8].

   Clients SHOULD be prepared to use at least the following BEEP tuning
   profiles:

   o  http://iana.org/beep/SASL/DIGEST-MD5, for user authentication
      without the need for session encryption
   o  http://iana.org/beep/TLS using TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
      cipher, for encryption
   o  http://iana.org/beep/TLS using TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
      cipher with client client-side certificates, for encryption and
      user authentication

   Anonymous client access SHOULD be considered in one of the two
   methods:

   1.  when no authentication tuning profile has been used
   2.  when using the http://iana-org/beep/SASL/ANONYMOUS profile

   Care should be taken that user authentication mechanisms do not
   reveal user credentials to untrusted servers.  Clients MUST NOT use
   the http://iana-org/beep/SASL/PLAIN tuning profile without first
   encrypting the TCP session, such as by using http://iana.org/beep/TLS
   tuning profile.

   Section 9 of BEEP [2] contains more details on BEEP-specific security
   issues.
