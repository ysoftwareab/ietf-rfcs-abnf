1.  Introduction

   EDHOC [I-D.selander-lake-edhoc] is a new protocol for autentication
   and key derivation that has been proposed as an alternative in IoT to
   provide a secure exchange in an end-to-end fashion.  This key
   material can be futher used to run other protocols such as OSCORE, as
   well as providing key material to any other protocol that needs pre-
   shared key material to secure the communications.  Provides
   authentication and key material generation, which are basic pillars
   to the design of an EAP method.  And indeed the most important thing
   is that it is lightweight and designed for IoT.  In addition, the
   EDHOC implementation that exists on the device can be reused to
   establish OSCORE Security Associations (SAs) for the authentication
   process.  EAP is a protocol that allows to implement different
   authentication mechanims, provides a framework for key management and
   has integration with AAA infrastructures.  For these reasons, this
   new EAP method will allow the different applications and use cases to
   take advantage of EAP.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Protocol Overview

2.1.  The EAP-EDHOC Conversation

   The EAP-EDHOC conversation typically starts with the negotiation of
   EAP by the EAP authenticator and the EAP peer.  The EAP authenticator
   typically sends an EAP-Request/Identity packet to the EAP peer, to

   which the EAP peer answers with an EAP-Response/Identity.  This last
   messages contains the peer's user-Id.

   From this point on, the authenticator MAY act as a forwarder of the
   EAP messages between the EAP peer and the server, if the pass-through
   mode is used, receiving the EAP packets from the peer, encapsulating
   them for transmission to the EAP server that will act as
   Authentication Server (AS).

   Once the EAP server receives the peer's Identity, it MUST respond
   with an an EAP-Request packet with EAP-Type=EAP-EDHOC and the
   prefered EDHOC authentication credential mode in decresing order, or
   no data if only one method is allowed or used.  The EAP-EDHOC
   conversation will then begin, with the peer sending an EAP-Response
   packet with EAP-Type=EAP-EDHOC.  The data field of that packet will
   encapsulate the "EDHOC Message 1".

   The EAP server will then respond with an EAP-Request packet with EAP-
   Type=EAP-EDHOC.  The data field of this packet will encapsulate
   "EDHOC Message 2" message.  To this message, the EAP peer will send
   the and EAP-Response message containing the "EDHOC Message 3"
   message.

   In the case where the EDHOC mutual authentication is successful, the
   conversation will appear as follows:

   It is RECOMMENDED to use NAIs in the Identity Response as identities.
   While

3.  Identity Verification

   The identity provided in the EAP-Response/Identity is not
   authenticated by EAP-EDHOC, hence SHALL NOT be used for authorization
   or accounting purposes.  The authenticator and the EAP server MAY
   examine the identity presented in EAP-Response/Identity for routing
   and EAP method selection.

4.  Key Hierarchy

   EDHOC uses HKDF RFC 5869 [RFC5869] to derive keys.  HKDF-Extract is
   used for deriving fixed-length uniformly pseudorandom keys (PRK) from
   ECDH shared secrets.  HKDF-Expand is used for deriving additional
   output keying material (OKM) from the PRKs.

   The derivation proceeds as follows:

   PRK = HKDF-Extract( salt, IKM )

   Where:

   HKDF-Extract = RFC5869 HKDF function

   salt = PSK when using symmetric keys, and the empty byte string when
   using asymmetric keys

   IKM (input keying material) = the ECDH shared secret

   Figure 2 illustrates the EDHOC Key Hierarchy.

   In EAP-EDHOC, the MSK, EMSK, and Initialization Vector (IV) are
   derived from the PRK via a hash function.  This ensures that the
   EDHOC PRK cannot be derived from the MSK, EMSK, or IV unless the hash
   function is defeated.  Since the MSK and EMSK are derived from the
   EDHOC PRK, if the EDHOC PRK is compromised then the MSK and EMSK are
   also compromised.

   EAP-EDHOC derives exported keying material and parameters as follows:

   Type-Code = 0XFF

   Key_Material = HKDF-Expand(EDHOC PRK, "EAP-EDHOC encryption", 128)

   MSK = Key_Material(0,63)

   EMSK = Key_Material(64,127)

   IV = HKDF-Expand(EDHOC PRK, "EAP-EDHOC IV", 64)

   Session-Id = Type-Code || Method-Id

   Method-Id = HKDF-Expand(EDHOC PRK, "EAP_EDHOC_Method-Id", 64)

   Where:

   Key_Material(S,F) = Octets S through F inclusive of the key material.
