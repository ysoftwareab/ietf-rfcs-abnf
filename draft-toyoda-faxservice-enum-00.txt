Abstract
     
     This document describes the functional specification 
     and the definition of the ENUM NAPTR record, for IFax 
     service. IFax is "Facsimile using Internet Mail".  For 
     this use, the DNS returns the email address of the 
     referenced IFax system. This mechanism allows email-based 
     fax communication to use telephone numbers, rather than 
     requiring that the sender already know the recipient 
     email address.


1.   Functional Specification

    An IFax client makes an [ENUMbis] DNS query, using the target  
    system's telephone number.  The returned NAPTR record 
    specifies an email address that is to be used for reaching
    the target system.  The email address is then used in 
    accordance with "Simple Mode of Facsimile using Internet 
    Mail" [RFC2305] or "Extended Facsimile using Internet 
    Mail" [RFC2532]. "Full Mode Fax Profile for Internet Mail" 
    is applied when it is approved as an Internet standards-track 
    specification.

2.   Definition of NAPTR record
2.1 Service Name   
    Service Name = "ifax"
    The scope of this service is facsimile using Internet mail.
    It includes "Simple Mode of Facsimile using Internet Mail"
    and "Extended Facsimile using Internet Mail". "Full Mode 
    Fax Profile for Internet Mail" is applied when it is 
    approved as an Internet standards-track specification.

2.2 Type
    Type = "ifax"

2.3 Subtype
    Subtype = "mailto"

2.4 URI Scheme
    Scheme = "mailto"

    The URI Scheme is "mailto" because facsimile using 
    Internet Mail is a profile for standard Internet mail and
    uses standard Internet mail addressing. 

2.5 Example
    $ORIGIN 4.3.2.1.6.7.9.8.6.4.e164.arpa
      IN NAPTR 10 10 "u" "E2U+ifax:mailto" "!^.*$!mailto:toyo@ifax.com!"

2.6 Intended usage
    COMMON


3 Security Consideration
    The Security Considerations section of [RFC2305] and 
    [RFC2532] applies to this document. In addition, note 
    that DNS records are public.  Therefore the mapping between 
    a telephone number and a specific email address is public.
