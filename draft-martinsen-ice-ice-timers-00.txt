                 ICE Timers, values and recommendations
                   draft-martinsen-ice-ice-timers-00

Abstract

   The ICE set of RFCs contains pacing and timer values.  The network
   gear initially used to test and figure out those values can now
   safely be considered obsolete.  This document describes the current
   timer values and pacing recommendations for the ICE RFCs.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes updated ICE related timing values and pacing
   recommendations.  As the world moves on and new knowledge is acquired
   it might be necessary or useful to update some of the timing
   sensitive recommendations in the ICE set of RFCs.  Rather then
   updating the entire set of ICE RFCs this document will be updated.
   (How is this done?  Obsolete an RFC and create a new one?  How many
   bis versions can there be?)

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document uses terminology defined in [RFC5245].

3.  Timers

   How to deal with RTO vs just sending a new STUN request with a new
   TransID?  (Implementation differences)

3.1.  RTO

   Since recent advancements in networking and the speed off light
   problem is no longer an issue this timer value can now be set to 0.

3.2.  Ta

   Some nice text describing the usage and current recommended values
   here..
