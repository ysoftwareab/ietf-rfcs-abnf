2.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   It is becoming increasingly important to support Dynamic
   Authorization extensions on the network access server (NAS) devices
   to handle the Disconnect and Change-of-Authorization (CoA) messages
   as described in [RFC3576] .  As a result, the effective management of
   RADIUS Dynamic Authorization entities is of considerable importance.
   It complements the managed objects used for managing RADIUS
   authentication and accounting clients as described in [RFC2618] and
   [RFC2620], respectively.

3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC2580
   [RFC2580].

4.  Terminology

   Dynamic Authorization Server (DAS)

   The component that resides on the NAS which processes the Disconnect
   and CoA requests sent by the Dynamic Authorization Client as
   described in [RFC3576].

   Dynamic Authorization Client (DAC)

   The component which sends the Disconnect and CoA requests to the
   Dynamic Authorization Server as described in [RFC3576].  This is
   typically a RADIUS Server, but is not limited to it and may, for
   example, be a Rating Engine used for Prepaid Billing.

   Dynamic Authorization Server Port

   The UDP port on which the Dynamic Authorization server listens for
   the Disconnect and CoA requests sent by the Dynamic Authorization
   Client.

5.  Overview

   The RADIUS dynamic authorization extensions defined in [RFC3576],
   distinguish between the client function and the server function.  In
   RADIUS dynamic authorization, clients send Disconnect-Requests and
   CoA-Requests, and servers reply with Disconnect-Acks, CoA-Acks, and
   CoA-NAKs.  Typically NAS devices implement the DAS function, and thus
   would be expected to implement the RADIUS dynamic authorization
   server MIB, while DACs implement the client function, and thus would
   be expected to implement the RADIUS dynamic authorization client MIB.

   However, it is possible for a RADIUS dynamic authorization entity to
   perform both client and server functions.  For example, a RADIUS
   proxy may act as a DAS to one or more DACs, while simultaneously
   acting as a DAC to one or more DASs.  In such situations, it is
   expected that RADIUS entities combining client and server
   functionality will support both the client and server MIBs.

   This memo describes the MIB for dynamic authorization servers and
   relates to the following documents as follows:

   [RFC2618] describes the MIB for a RADIUS authentication client.

   [RFC2619] describes the MIB for a RADIUS authentication server.

   [RFC2620] describes the MIB for a RADIUS accounting client.

   [RFC2621] describes the MIB for a RADIUS accounting server.

   [DYNCLNT] describes the MIB for a RADIUS dynamic authorization
   client.

   A NAS typically implements the MIBs for a RADIUS authentication
   client, a RADIUS accounting client, and a RADIUS dynamic
   authorization server.  However, there is not strict relationship
   between these three MIBs, i.e. one MIB can be implemented without
   implementing the other MIBs.  Similarly, for the other 3 MIBs
   mentioned above, a typical case would be where the MIBs for a RADIUS
   authentication server, a RADIUS accounting server, and a RADIUS
   dynamic authorization client are implemented by the same device.
   However, also for these 3 MIBs, they can be implemented independent
   from each other.  A RADIUS proxy might implement any of these 6 MIBs,
   but can also implement any subset of these MIBs.

7.  Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   radiusDynAuthClientAddress and radiusDynAuthClientAddressType

   These can be used to determine the address of the DAC with which the
   DAS is communicating.  This information could be useful in mounting
   an attack on the DAC.

   radiusDynAuthServerIdentifier

   This can be used to determine the Identifier of the DAS.  This
   information could be useful in impersonating the DAS.

   The other readable objects are not really considered as being
   sensitive or vulnerable.  These objects are:

   radiusDynAuthServerDisconInvalidClientAddresses,
   radiusDynAuthServerCoAInvalidClientAddresses,
   radiusDynAuthServDisconRequests,
   radiusDynAuthServDupDisconRequests,
   radiusDynAuthServDisconAcks,
   radiusDynAuthServDisconNaks,
   radiusDynAuthServDisconUserSessRemoved,
   radiusDynAuthServMalformedDisconRequests,
   radiusDynAuthServDisconBadAuthenticators,
   radiusDynAuthServDisconPacketsDropped,
   radiusDynAuthServCoARequests,
   radiusDynAuthServDupCoARequests,
   radiusDynAuthServCoAAcks,
   radiusDynAuthServCoANaks,
   radiusDynAuthServCoAUserSessChanged,
   radiusDynAuthServMalformedCoARequests,
   radiusDynAuthServCoABadAuthenticators,
   radiusDynAuthServCoAPacketsDropped, and

   radiusDynAuthServUnknownTypes.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
