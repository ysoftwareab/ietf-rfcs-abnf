 Improving the Reaction of Customer Edge Routers to Renumbering Events
                  draft-gont-v6ops-cpe-slaac-renum-00

Abstract

   In scenarios where network configuration information related to IPv6
   prefixes becomes invalid without any explicit signaling of that
   condition (such as when a CPE crashes and reboots without knowledge
   of the previously-employed prefixes), hosts on the local network will
   continue using stale prefixes for an unacceptably long period of
   time, thus resulting in connectivity problems.  This document
   specifies improvements to Customer Edge Routers that help mitigate
   the aforementioned problem for typical residential and small office
   scenarios.

1.  Introduction

   In scenarios where network configuration information related to IPv6
   prefixes becomes invalid without any explicit signaling of that
   condition, nodes on the local network will continue using stale
   prefixes for an unacceptably long period of time, thus resulting in
   connectivity problems.  This problem is documented in detail in
   [I-D.gont-v6ops-slaac-renum].

   This document specifies improvements to Customer Edge Routers that
   help mitigate the aforementioned problem for residential or small
   office scenarios.

2.  Improved CPE behavior

   This section specifies and clarifies requirements for CPE routers
   (particularly when they advertise with SLAAC [RFC4862] prefixes
   learned via DHCPv6-PD [RFC8415]) that can help mitigate the problem
   discussed in Section 1.  This would obviously make robustness
   dependent on the CPE (on which the user or ISP may have no control),
   as opposed to the host itself.

   The updated behaviour is as follows:

   o  CPE routers MUST signal stale configuration information as
      specified in Section 2.2



Gont, et al.               Expires May 4, 2020                  [Page 2]

Internet-Draft       Reaction to Renumbering Events        November 2019


   o  CPE routers MUST implement the DHCPv6-PD/SLAAC interface specified
      in Section 2.1.

   o  CPE routers SHOULD NOT automatically send DHCPv6-PD RELEASE
      messages upon reboot events.

2.1.  Interaction Between DHCPv6-PD and SLAAC

   The "Preferred Lifetime" and "Valid Lifetime" of PIOs [RFC4861]
   corresponding to prefixes learned via DHCPv6-PD MUST NOT span past
   the lease time of the DHCPv6-PD prefixes.  This means that the
   advertised "Preferred Lifetime" and "Valid Lifetime" MUST be
   dynamically adjusted such that the advertised lifetimes never span
   past the lease time of the prefixes delegated via DHCPv6-PD.

   This is in line with these existing requirements from other
   specifications, which we reference here for clarity:

   o  [RFC8415] specifies, in Section 6.3, that "if the delegated prefix
      or a prefix derived from it is advertised for stateless address
      autoconfiguration [RFC4862], the advertised preferred and valid
      lifetimes MUST NOT exceed the corresponding remaining lifetimes of
      the delegated prefix."

   RATIONALE:

      *  The lifetime values employed for the "Preferred Lifetime"
         (AdvPreferredLifetime) and "Valid Lifetime" (AdvValidLifetime)
         should never be larger than the remaining lease time for the
         corresponding prefix (as learned via DHCPv6-PD).

      *  The lifetime values advertised for prefixes corresponding to a
         prefix leased via DHCPv6-PD should be dynamically updated
         (rather than static values), since otherwise the advertised
         lifetimes would eventually span past the DHCPv6-PD lease time.

2.2.  Signaling Stale Configuration Information

   In order to phase-out stale configuration information:

   o  A CPE router sending RAs that advertise dynamically-learned
      prefixes (e.g. via DHCPv6-PD) on an interface MUST record, on
      stable storage, the list of prefixes being advertised on each
      network segment.

   o  Upon changes to the advertised prefixes, and after bootstrapping,
      the CPE router advertising prefix information via SLAAC should
      proceed as follows:

Internet-Draft       Reaction to Renumbering Events        November 2019


      *  Any prefixes that were previously advertised via SLAAC, but
         that are not currently intended for address configuration, MUST
         be advertised with a PIO option with the "A" bit set to 1 and
         the "Valid Lifetime" and a "Preferred Lifetime" set to 0.

      *  Any prefixes that were previously advertised via SLAAC as "on-
         link", but that are not currently not considered "on-link",
         MUST be advertised with a PIO option with the "L" bit set to 1
         and the "Valid Lifetime" and a "Preferred Lifetime" set to 0.

      *  If both of the previous conditions are met (a prefix was
         previously advertised with both the "A" and "L" bits set, but
         is currently *not* intended for address configuration and is
         *not* considered on-link), the prefix MUST be advertised with a
         PIO option with both the "A" and "L" bits set to 1 and the
         "Valid Lifetime" and a "Preferred Lifetime" set to 0.  That is.
         the advertisements of the previous two steps can be coalesced
         into a single one with both the "A" and "L" bits set.

      *  The aforementioned advertisement SHOULD be performed for at
         least the "Valid Lifetime" previously employed for such prefix.

   The aforementioned improved behaviour assumes compliance with the
   following existing requirements from other specifications, which we
   reference here for clarity:

   o  [RFC7084] specifies (requirement LE-13, in Section 4.3) that when
      the delegated prefix changes (i.e., the current prefix is replaced
      with a new prefix without any overlapping time period), "the IPv6
      CE router MUST immediately advertise the old prefix with a
      Preferred Lifetime of zero and a Valid Lifetime of either a) zero
      or b) the lower of the current Valid Lifetime and two hours (which
      must be decremented in real time) in a Router Advertisement
      message as described in Section 5.5.3, (e) of [RFC4862]"

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document discusses a problem that may arise in scenarios where
   dynamic IPv6 prefixes are employed, and proposes improvements to
   Customer Edge Routers [RFC7084] to mitigate the problem for
   residential or small office scenarios.  It does not introduce new
   security issues.
