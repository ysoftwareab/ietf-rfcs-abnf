Abstract

   This memo describes how provider based unidirectional Virtual Circuit
   VPNs can be implemented using a directory (such as DNS) and LDP for
   PE discovery and label distribution.

1. Introduction

   This memo describes a simple mechanism to implement provider based
   unidirectional Virtual Circuit (VC) VPNs using a directory and LDP
   [1] for PE discovery and label distribution.

   A VPN consists of CE routers that have full mesh VC connectivity
   between each other.  The VCs are unidirectional and organized so that
   each CE has a single inbound VC for receiving packets from all other
   CEs and one outbound VC per each other CE for sending packets to the
   other CEs.  The network thus merges the VCs bound for the same CE,
   which greatly reduces signaling traffic and the amount of label

   state.

   LDP is used not only for exchanging label information between PE
   devices, but also between PEs and CEs.  That makes configuration of
   both PEs and CEs very simple.  For a CE the only thing that needs to
   be configured is a protocol address for each VPN that the CE
   participates in.  For the PEs the only configuration task is
   assignment of PE ports to VPNs.  If Frame Relay LMI or ATM ILMI would
   be used on the PE-CE links, there would be no way for the a PE to
   indicate to a CE which VPN an advertised label belongs to.

   The directory can be anything where the IP addresses of the PEs of a
   VPN can be stored and queried from.  In this memo we have chosen to
   use DNS directory as proposed in [2].

   An advantage of a directory/LDP based solution for provider based
   VPNs is that it doesn't require BGP implementation or configuration
   complexity in the PE routers and can be easily deployed also in
   inter-AS cases where the VPN sites are attached to PEs in more than
   one AS.  The choice of DNS for the directory is justified because it
   is already in wide use and can be deployed without any new
   standardization effort.

   Similar DNS/LDP based solution can also be applied to provider based
   Ethernet VPNs as described in [3].  It is also possible to use a
   DNS/LDP based solution for implementing bidirectional VC VPNs.
   Details of the latter may be described in a later memo.

2. Addition of Sites

2.1 Configuration Actions

   DNS/LDP based Ethernet VPNs are very easy to provision.  Only the
   following two configuration actions are needed when a new site (CE
   device) is added to a VPN:

     (1) If the PE device (PE for short) does not previously connect any
         sites of this VPN, the IP address of the PE is configured to
         DNS under domain name

         vpn-number.as-number.domain

         where "vpn-number" and "as-number" are components of the VPN ID
         (Route Distinguisher [4]) of the VPN and "domain" is the domain
         of the administrative "owner", (e.g., an ISP) of the VPN.

     (2) The port of the PE to which the site is connected to is
         configured to belong to the VPN.  This is done by specifying

INTERNET DRAFT                                             October, 2001


         the domain, type, and VPN ID of the VPN.

   This document covers the case where the type of the VPN is
   "Unidirectional VC".  Other possibilities include "Ethernet" and
   "Bidirectional VC".  The former has already been described in [3].
   If there is sufficient interest, the latter can be later described in
   in another memo.

   Note that also in the case of a multi-provider VPN, the
   administrative "owner" of the VPN is the single body that operates
   the master DNS server for the VPN zone.  The "owner" of a VPN MAY
   choose to make all updates to the zone data of the VPN itself or MAY
   allow other providers to dynamically update the zone data.  In the
   latter case, the use of secure dynamic updates [5] is recommended.

2.2 Protocol Actions

   After the above configuration actions, the following protocol actions
   take place at the PE of the new site:

     (1) The PE sends a Label Request Message to the CE of the new site
         requesting for a label to be used for sending packets from
         other sites of the VPN to the new site.

     (2) The PE sends a Label Mapping Message to each of the other CEs
         connected to it that belong to the same VPN as the new site.
         The Label Mapping Message advertises a label to be used by
         another CE when it sends packets to the new site.

     (3) The PE maps the labels that it advertised to the other CEs in
         steps (2) to the label that it got from the CE of the new site
         in step (1).

     (4) If the new site is the first site of the VPN at the PE, the PE
         queries DNS for IP addresses of the other (remote) PEs of the
         VPN and establishes an LDP session with each of the remote PEs
         unless one already exists.

     (5) The PE sends a Label Mapping Message to each of the remote PEs
         that advertises a label to be used when a remote PE sends
         packets to the new site.

     (6) The PE maps the labels that it advertised to the other PEs in
         step (5) to the label that it got from the CE of the new site
         in step (1).

   The following protocol actions take place at a PE when it receives a
   Label Mapping message from another PE:

INTERNET DRAFT                                             October, 2001


     (1) The PE checks from the DNS that the other PE belongs to the
         VPN of the Label Mapping Message and that it itself has at
         least one site in that VPN. If not, the PE responds to the
         Label Mapping Message with a Label Release Message and no other
         protocol actions take place at the PE.

     (2) The PE checks if it already has a label for the VPN site of
         the Label Mapping Message. If so, the PE responds to the Label
         Mapping Message with a Label Release Message and no other
         protocol actions take place at the PE.

     (3) The PE sends a Label Mapping Message to each CE connected
         to it that belongs to the VPN of the advertised label. The
         messages advertise labels to be used by the CEs when they send
         packets to the site at the other PE.

     (4) The PE maps the labels that it advertised to its CEs in step
         (3) to the label that it got from the other PE.

     (5) If the label that the PE got from the other PE is the first
         label from the other PE for this VPN, the PE sends a Label
         Mapping Message to the other PE for *each* CE that is connected
         to it for this VPN (unless it has already done so).

   The Label Request and Mapping Messages send from PEs to CEs use the
   following VPN FEC TLV:

      0                   1                   2                   3

   The Site Index uniquely identifies the site of the VPN at the PE that
   sends the Label Mapping Message.

3. Removal of Sites

3.1 Configuration Actions

   The following configuration actions are needed when an existing site (CE
   device) is removed from a VPN:

     (1) If the site to be removed is the last site of the VPN at the
         PE, the IP address of the PE is removed from DNS.

     (2) The site is removed from the VPN by unconfiguring the VPN from
         the port of the PE to which the site is connected to.

3.2 Protocol Actions

   After the above configuration actions, the following protocol actions
   take place at the PE of the removed site:

     (1) If the removed site was the last site of the VPN at the PE, the PE
         checks, before proceeding to the other steps, that its IP address
         does not anymore exist in the DNS in the zone of the VPN.

     (2) The PE releases the label it had requested from the removed CE for
         this VPN by sending the CE a Label Release Message.

     (3) The PE releases any labels it had advertised to the removed CE for
         other sites of this VPN by sending the CE for each such site a
         Label Withdraw Message.

INTERNET DRAFT                                             October, 2001


     (4) The PE removes the labels it had advertised for the removed VPN
         site to the other CEs at the PE itself and to remote PEs by
         sending them a Label Withdraw Message.

   In addition to processing the Label Withdraw Message, the following
   protocol actions take place at a PE when it receives a Label Withdraw
   Message from another PE:

     (1) The PE removes the labels it had advertised for the removed VPN
         site to the CEs at the PE by sending them a Label Withdraw
         message.

     (2) If there is no other labels left at the PE to sites of the VPN at
         the other PE, the PE removes the labels that is had advertised to
         the other PE for this VPN by sending it for each such label a
         Label Withdraw Message.

     (3) If there is no remaining need to keep the LDP session up between
         the PE and the other PE, the PE MAY terminate the LDP session
         with the other PE.

4. Failure Recovery

   If a PE looses its LDP session with another PE having site(s) in a
   common VPN, the PE releases all labels it had advertised to the other PE
   for this VPN. The PE then tries to re-establish the LDP session until
   (a) the session gets established or (b) this PE or the other PE no
   longer have site(s) in this VPN.  Once the LDP session gets established,
   the PE advertises to the other PE a label for each site of the VPN at
   this PE as described in section 2.2.

   When a PE recovers from a crash, it adds each of the configured VPN
   site(s) to their respective VPN(s) as described in section 2.2.

5. Exponential Back-off Behavior

   If any protocol action does not succeed immediately, the normal behavior
   is that the PE keeps on trying with exponential back-off until the action
   succeeds or becomes invalid due to a change in VPN configuration.  If
   the protocol action fails for an implementation specific prolonged
   period of time, the PE SHOULD notify the VPN operator about the problem
   via a management action.

6. Data Plane

   When a CE needs to send a packet to another CE in the same VPN, the CE
   prefixes the packet by a protocol identifier and a label stack entry [6]
   holding a label that the PE has advertised to it for this VPN.  The CE



Heinanen           Unidirectional Virtual Circuit VPNs          [Page 6]

INTERNET DRAFT                                             October, 2001


   can use a technique such as [7] to discover the protocol address of a CE
   reachable via each label.

   It is also possible to use some other frame format than the label stack
   entry, for example, Frame Relay or ATM AAL5, on the CE-PE link.  In all
   cases, the labels used in the frames are those advertised via LDP when a
   site was added to the VPN.  In case of Frame Relay, this means that the
   advertised label values must fit into the DLCI field of the Frame Relay
   frame.  In case of ATM, the first 4 bits of the advertised label value
   are used as the VPI value and the remaining 16 bits as the VCI value.

   When the PE receives a frame from the CE, it either forwards it directly
   to another CE at the same PE or uses any available tunnel, such as a HIP,
   GRE, IPSec, VLAN, or MPLS, to forward the frame to another PE.  Before
   doing so, it replaces the label in the received frame by another label
   that it had learned from the other CE or another PE for this site.  The
   frame format between PEs is always the label stack entry.

   The protocol identifier identifies the protocol of the packet that
   follows it.  What kind of protocol identifier is used, depends on the
   frame format.  The default protocol identifier for label stack entry and
   Frame Relay is NLPID [8], whereas the default for ATM AAL5 is LLC/SNAP
   [9].

   How a PE decides, which tunneling protocol to use to send labeled
   packets to another PE, is outside the scope of this memo.  Usually the
   PE would try tunneling protocols in its own preferred order until the
   tunnel gets established.  In most cases the availability of a tunneling
   protocol can be determined by out-of-band means (e.g., DNS in case of
   HIP and IPSec, existence of an outer tunnel in case of MPLS, or
   existence of a shared authentication key in case of GRE).

7. DNS Zone Update Latency

   Since the addition of the first site and removal of the last site of a
   VPN in a particular PE cannot proceed before the change has propagated
   to all DNS servers serving the zone of the VPN, it is important to try
   to minimize the latency of VPN zone updates.  This can be achieved by
   turning on DNS NOTIFY [10] in the master server of each VPN zone and by
   configuring zone refresh times relatively small.

8. DNS Message Size

   Correct operation of directory/LDP based VPNs requires that IP addresses
   of all PE routers of a VPN fit into a single DNS response.  In order to
   be able to support large VPNs with a large number of PEs, the message
   size requirements of [11] also apply to DNS servers and resolvers used
   for implementing the mechanism of this memo.  Fulfilling those



Heinanen           Unidirectional Virtual Circuit VPNs          [Page 7]

INTERNET DRAFT                                             October, 2001


   requirements allows provisioning of directory/LDP based VPNs that
   consist of a few hundred of PEs.

9. Security Considerations

   Security of directory/LDP based VPNs depends on security of the
   directory (DNS), LDP, and the tunneling protocol(s).  Security of LDP is
   covered in the security section of [1].  Also the various tunneling
   protocol specifications have their own security sections.

   Regarding DNS security, the important issues related to this memo are
   security of zone transfers and integrity and authentication of DNS
   queries and responses.  These two problems are addressed by DNS
   extensions [12] and [13].

   No DNS extensions exist for providing confidentiality for queries or
   responses. It is thus possible that if a party knows the VPN ID of a VPN
   and the zone that hosts it, the party can find out the IP addresses of
   PE routers that connect sites of that domain.  Depending on the
   situation, that may or may not be an acceptable security risk.

   In a single-provider VPN, the DNS servers that host the VPN information
   can be easily fire-walled from all public access. Another way to prevent
   outside parties from accessing VPN information is to use DNS access
   lists that VPN zone related queries only from trusted PE routers.

   See [2] for additional DNS/VPN related security discussion.
