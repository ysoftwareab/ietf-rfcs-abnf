      Efficient Layer 2 Multicast with Point-to-Point Pseudowires
                  draft-cheng-pals-p2p-pw-multicast-00

Abstract

   Multicast services such as Evolved Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast
   Service (eMBMS) become more and more popular in mobile networks.  In
   mobile transport network, it is important for the operators to
   provide efficient transport of multicast services with existing
   network devices.  This document describes a mechanism of using point-
   to-point Pseudowires (PW) [RFC 3985] to achieve efficient layer 2
   multicast transportation in mobile transport networks.

             Figure 1. L2 Multicast Topology

   Figure 1 shows a typical topology of mobile transport network, which
   is composed of the layer 3 network at the core and the layer 2
   network at the aggregation and edge.  R-1 and R-2 connect to the
   upstream layer 3 network, in which the multicast source locates.
   This document focuses on the efficient multicast service
   transportation in the layer 2 segment of the network using point-to-
   point (P2P) Pseudowires (PW) [RFC3985].

2.  Efficient Multicast with P2P PWs

   This section describes the mechanism of efficient layer 2 multicast
   transportation with point-to-point PWs.

   In the layer 2 multicast segment, nodes which connect to the L3
   network are called Root nodes, and nodes which connect to the
   multicast clients are called Leaf nodes.  For each multicast service,
   between the Root nodes and the Leaf nodes, 1-hop P2P PWs are
   provisioned between the adjacent nodes.  The multicast tree from the
   Root nodes to the Leaf nodes is the concatenation of P2P PWs
   provisioned by NMS or central controller.

Internet-Draft     Efficient L2 Multicast with P2P PWs          Nov 2017


   Multicast traffic is carried by the P2P PWs.  On each PW hop, the PW
   label is popped, and the forwarding is performed according to the
   layer 2 multicast forwarding table of the node.  The layer 2
   multicast forwarding entries can be either statically provisioned by
   NMS or central controller, or dynamically generated via IGMP
   snooping[RFC4541].  For multicast traffic received on a specific P2P
   PW, the outbound PWs and ACs are determined by the corresponding L2
   multicast forwarding table.  For packets to be forwarded to next P2P
   PW, the PW label is pushed according to the forwarding table.  With
   this mechanism, on each P2P PW in the network, at most one copy of
   the multicast traffic is delivered.

   On the Leaf nodes, IGMP snooping [RFC4541] is used to optimize the
   layer 2 multicast forwarding to the clients, so that only the clients
   which express interests to the multicast service would receive the
   corresponding multicast traffic.

3.  Protection Mechanism

   For layer 2 multicast service, 1+1 protection is provided.  The
   working and protection multicast trees are provisioned seperately by
   NMS or central controller, and multicast service is carried on both
   the working mutlicast tree and the protection multicast tree
   simultaneously.  In network topology of Figure 1, the Root node of
   the working PW is R-1, while the Root node of the protection PW is
   R-2.  Each Leaf node has a working PW from its working upstream, and
   a protection PW from the protection upstream.  According to the
   result of OAM detection mechanism, the Leaf nodes choose to receive
   multicast traffic from either the working or protection PW.

4.  OAM

   PW OAM mechanisms as defined in [RFC5085] [RFC6428] are deployed on
   each P2P PW, including both the working PWs and protection PWs.  When
   failure occurs on a working PW, the node which detects the failure
   SHOULD send AIS message as defined in [RFC6427] to notify its
   downstream nodes of the failure.  This AIS message is propagated
   along the multicast tree to the downstream Leaf nodes.  Then the Leaf
   nodes which are impacted by the failure can switchover to receive
   the multicast service traffic from the protection PWs.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document describes a layer 2 multicst mechansim with point-to-
   point PWs and NMS or controller provisioned multicast tree.  The
   security condierations as specified in [RFC3985] apply to this
   document.
