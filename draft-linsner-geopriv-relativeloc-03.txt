     Abstract 

        This document defines additional civic address parameters for use in 
        Location Objects [1], [2], and [4].  The format is based on the civic 
        address definition of PIDF-LO.  These additional parameters allow 
        expression of a relative location within a building or campus.

     1. Introduction 

        Campus wireless LAN technologies are adding capabilities to locate 
        serving hosts via radio frequency measurement technologies.  This new 
        capability is able to provide additional and more accurate location 
        information when used inside a building, or on a campus in 
        conjunction with civic addressing.   The data produced from these 
        technologies is most useful if expressed as relative position as 
        opposed to expressing as a globally anchored geo location (latitude,

        longitude).  Relative position dictates the expression of a civic 
        anchor point within the confines of the building or campus (a 
        starting point for measurement) hence providing both the relative 
        position and relative location offset from the relative position is 
        provided. 

        The data included within the relative position parameters is 
        supplementary to, not exclusive of, the existing civic location data 
        expressed in PIDF-LO [1], [2] and DHCP Civic Location option [4].  An 
        example of this may be a popular wireless hotspot located at 234 N. 
        Main St.  It is reasonable to expect that 234 N. Main St. covers a 
        geographic area that encompasses several hundred square meters.  The 
        wireless network architecture for this hotspot could include several 
        wireless infrastructure access points.  The supplementary data 
        provided via relative location would enable a more granular location 
        expression.  In addition to providing 234 N. Main St., a relative 
        position like "6 meters south and 9 meters east of the main entrance" 
        could be added. 

        It is expected this supplementary civic location data will be used 
        within the confines of the associated civic location and SHOULD not 
        purposely be used to represent locations that are off-campus, or 
        outside the boundary of the expressed civic address.  It is 
        recognized that RF signals do not stop at the civic address 
        boundaries and in some cases the resultant location may fall outside 
        the confines of the civic address.  To address such cases, the 
        reference point MUST be contained within the civic address and the 
        resultant location SHOULD fall inside the boundaries of the civic 
        address.  In other words, using the cited example, providing a street 
        address of 234 N. Main St. and then provide this relative location 
        data that result in the location residing at another street address 
        SHOULD not be allowed. 

        Although [1] and [4] currently supports additional elements, like 
        CAtypes 28 (room), 32 (additional code), or 33 (seat), results from 
        the radio frequency measurement technologies are alternatives to 
        these existing elements and in some cases the resultant location can 
        be more accurate.

     3. Additions to PIDF-LO 

        PIDF-LO, as updated by [2], includes a full set of parameters used to 
        describe civic locations.  The new parameters defined here are 
        additional to the updated set and provide a means to describe a 
        host's civic location with added granularity. 

     4. Additions to DHCP Civic Location Option 

        The new parameters defined here are additional and will update DHCP 
        Civic Location Option [4] 

     5. Relative Location 

        Relative location is defined by 2 new parameters, reference point and 
        relative position.  Reference point, similar to geodetic datum, 
        defines the anchor point (0,0 point) used for measurement of the 
        relative position parameter.  Measurement from the anchor point is 
        provided in 3 dimensions, X, Y and Z.  The east-west dimension is 
        labeled X and north-south dimension is labeled Y.  A positive Y value 
        is considered north of the reference point, a negative Y value south 
        of the reference point, a positive X value for east of the reference 
        point and a negative X value for west of the reference point. The 
        measurement value is in meters. 

        The fourth, height or altitude parameter (Z) found in normal geodetic 
        systems can be optionally expressed via these new parameters but 
        might be more useful converted to floor values and expressed in via 
        CAtype 27, the FLR or Floor parameter, previously defined for [1] and 
        [4].  If the altitude (Z) parameter is expressed, it is assumed to 
        utilize locally significant ground level (the ground directly below 
        the relative location) as the reference point from which to measure. 

        For this usage, defining the reference point of local significance is 
        completely subjective, but utilizing intuitively obviously locations, 
        like 'Elevator', 'Exit Door', 'Stairwell' is suggested.  As this 
        mechanism is not intended for millimeter accuracy, human judgment 
        will play in defining the measurement start point.  Measurements 
        SHOULD start at the center of the declared reference point.

     6. Security Considerations 

        The XML parameters defined in the document are additions to the 
        current PIDF-LO specification.  Therefore the parameters defined here 
        are subject to the same security considerations of [1].

     7. IANA Considerations 

     7.1. XML Schema Registration 

        IANA will update the registered XML schema with additions as shown in 
        section 5 of this document. 

        URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:pidf:geopriv10:civicAddr 

     7.2. CAType Registry Update 

        IANA will update the civic address type registry established by 
        RFC4776.  The additions to the registry are shown in Table 1 of the 
        document.
