Abstract

   This document proposes the "standard" address assignment scheme for
   IPv6 access network which uses RA or DHCPv6 to assign an global IPv6
   address to the WAN interface of the CPE and DHCPv6 PD on the upstream
   link of CPE to delegate one or more /64 prefixes to the CPE.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes about the "standard" address assignment
   scheme for IPv6 access network for especially residential or SOHO
   service.


2.  General Considerations

   In IPv4 environment, there is a de-fact standard method to subscribe
   ISP service.  Usually, PPP (Point to Point Protocol) is used as an
   abstraction of the user subscription in IPv4 only environment.  A PPP
   connection connects an access concentrator and a customer premises
   equipment (CPE).  One single global IPv4 address is assigned to the
   WAN interface of the CPE.  If CPE is a router, typically, CPE does
   "network address translation (NAT)" and gives [RFC1918] based private
   addresses to the hosts behind the CPE such as an personal computer
   (PC) and so on.  Even if the CPE is a bridging device, a PC beyond
   CPE terminates PPP (PPPoE maybe) by itself and receives a global IPv4
   address to be used.  In each cases, from an access concentrator point
   of view, there is no difference.  The model is quite simple.  It
   gives to the "customer" one global IPv4 address.  That's all.

   On the other hand, if we think about IPv6 ISP, this model does not
   work well, because there is no NAT in IPv6.  Simply, we cannot use
   "One global IPv6 address" model to assign global IPv6 addresses to
   all machines behind the CPE router.  We have to rely on some
   different model.


3.  1+/64s scheme

                                                     +-----+   +-- PC
                +---------------------+              |     |   |
   Internet <---+ access concentrator +--- uplink ---+ CPE +---+
                +---------------------+    (WAN)     |     |   |
                                                     +-----+   LAN

                          Figure 1: Network Model

   "1+/64s" is quite simple scheme.

   (A) Use RA or DHCPv6 to assign an global IPv6 address to the WAN
       interface of the CPE.  Do not leave the link between the access
       concentrator and the CPE (the upstream link) link-local address
       only.

   (B) Use DHCPv6 PD the upstream link to delegate one or more /64
       prefixes to the CPE so that it can use those prefixes to
       configure LANs behind it.


4.  Discussion

   The reason why the condition (A) is needed is that there are "strong
   model" implementations of the Internet Protocol.  When we wrote
   [RFC4241] ("A Model of IPv6/IPv4 Dual Stack Internet Access Service"
   an Informational RFC describing NTT Communications' native IPv4/v6
   dual stack ADSL service specification), we believed that there is no
   need to use any global IPv6 address for the uplink.  But, at the year
   2007, when Microsoft Vista was released to the market, we found that
   that operating system employs the strong host model shown in
   [RFC1122].

   In this case, if the WAN interface of the CPE has only link-local
   address, any application on the CPE cannot use the global ip address
   even if this CPE has delegated prefix for LAN interface but chose the
   link-local address as its source address towards any destination on
   the Internet.  So, we need to assign a global IPv6 address to the WAN
   interface on the CPE.


5.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations.


6.  Security Considerations

   TBD
