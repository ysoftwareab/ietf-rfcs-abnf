1.  Introduction

   The ITU-T recommendation H.263[H263] specifies the encoding used by
   ITU-T compliant video-conference codecs.  The first version (version
   1) was approved in 1996 by the ITU and a payload format for
   encapsulating this H.263 bitstream in the Real-Time Transport
   Protocol (RTP) is in RFC-2190[RFC2190] In 1998 the ITU approved a new
   version of H.263 [H263] that is also known as H.263 plus.  This
   version added optional features and a new payload format is now in
   RFC-2429.[RFC2429] RFC-2429 is capable of carrying encoded video bit
   steams that are using only the basic H.263 version 1 options.

   RFC-2429 [RFC2429] states that it does not replace RFC 2190, which
   continues to be used by existing implementations, and may be required
   for backward compatibility in new implementations.  Implementations
   using the new features of the 1998 version of H.263 shall use the
   format described in this document.

   RFC-2429 is now being revised and will now include a language that
   will make it clear that all new implementations MUST use the new RFC
   for encoding any version of H.263.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119[RFC2119] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant RTP implementations.

3.  Recommendation

   RFC-2429 and the its updates can be used to carry new H.263 payload
   even if they are using only the features defined in the the 1996
   version.  All the H.263 features that are part of the 1996 version
   are also part of the 1998 version.

   It is recommended that RFC-2190 will be moved to historic status and
   that as stated in RFC-2429 new implementations will use RFC-2429 and
   the H263-1998 and H263-2000 MIME subtypes.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The section updates the previous registered version of the H263
   payload type in RFC 3555[RFC3555].  The document request to move the
   H263 payload type to historic state.
