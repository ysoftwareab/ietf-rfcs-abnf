      Advertising Node Admin Tags in BGP Link-State Advertisements
           draft-ietf-idr-bgp-ls-node-admin-tag-extension-00

Abstract

   This document describes the protocol extensions to collect node
   administrative tags adevertised in IGP Link State advertisements and
   disseminate the same in BGP Link-State advertisement protocol, to
   facilitate inter-AS TE applications that may need the same node
   administrative tags to associate a subset of network devices spanning
   across more than one AS with a specific functionality.

1.  Introduction

   Advertising Node Administrative Tags in Link State protocols like IS-
   IS [RFC7917] and OSPF [RFC7777] allows adding an optional operational
   capability, that allows tagging and grouping of the nodes in a IGP
   domain.  This, among other applications, allows simple management and
   easy control over route and path selection, based on local configured
   policies.  However node administrative tags advertised in IGP
   advertisements let network operators associate nodes within a single
   AS (if not a single area).  This limits the use of such node
   administrative tags and applications that need to associate a subset

Internet-Draft          Node Admin Tags in BGP-LS          December 2016


   of network devices spanning across multiple AS with a specific
   functionality cannot use them.

   To address the need for applications that require visibility into
   LSDB across IGP areas, or even across ASes, the BGP-LS address-
   family/sub-address-family have been defined that allows BGP to carry
   LSDB information.  The BGP Network Layer Reachability Information
   (NLRI) encoding format for BGP-LS and a new BGP Path Attribute called
   BGP-LS attribute are defined in [RFC7752].  The identifying key of
   each LSDB object, namely a node, a link or a prefix, is encoded in
   the NLRI and the properties of the object are encoded in the BGP-LS
   attribute.  Figure 1 describes a typical deployment scenario.  In
   each IGP area, one or more nodes are configured with BGP-LS.  These
   BGP speakers form an IBGP mesh by connecting to one or more route-
   reflectors.  This way, all BGP speakers - specifically the route-
   reflectors - obtain LSDB information from all IGP areas (and from
   other ASes from EBGP peers).  An external component connects to the
   route-reflector to obtain this information (perhaps moderated by a
   policy regarding what information is sent to the external component,
   and what information isn't).

   the corresponding BGP-LS Node NLRI is proposed.  For more details on
   the Node Attribute TLVs please refer to section 3.3.1 in [RFC7752]

2.  Per-Node Administrative Tag

   An administrative Tag is a 32-bit integer value that can be used to
   identify a group of nodes in the entire routing domain.  The new sub-
   TLV specifies one or more administrative tag values.  A BGP Link-
   State speaker that also participates in the IGP link state
   advertisements exchange may learn one or more node administrative
   tags advertised by another router in the same IGP domain.  Such BGP-
   LS speaker shall encode the same set of node administrative tags in
   the corresponding Node Attribute TLV representing the network device
   that originated the node administrative tags.

   The node administrative tags advertised in IGP link state
   advertisements will have either per-area(or levels in IS-IS)scope or
   'global' scope.  Operator may choose to a set of node administrative
   tags across areas (or levels in IS-IS) and another advertise set of
   node administrative tags within the specific area (or level).  But
   evidently two areas within the same AS or two different may use the
   same node administrative tag for different purposes.  In such case
   applications will need to distinguish between the per-area(or level)
   scoped administrative tags originated from a specific node against
   those originated from the same node with 'global' scope.

   A BGP-LS router in a given AS while copying the node administrative
   tags learnt from IGP link-state advertisements, MUST also copy the
   scope associated with the node administrative tags.  Refer to
   Section 3.1 for how to encode the associated scope of a node
   administrative tags as well.

   To be able to distinguish between the significance of a per-area(or
   level) administrative tag learnt in one area, from that advertised in
   another area, or another AS, any applications receiving such a BGP-LS
   advertisements MUST consider the scope associated with each node
   administrative tag with 'per-area (or per-level) along with the
   area(or level in IS-IS) associated with corresponding IGP link state
   advertisement and the AS number associated with the originating node.
   The area(or level) associated with corresponding IGP link state
   advertisement and the AS number associated with the originating node
   can be derived from appropriate node attributes (already defined in
   BGP-LS [RFC7752]) attached with the corresponding Node NLRI.

3.  BGP-LS Extensions for Per-Node Administrative Tags

   The BGP-LS NLRI can be a node NLRI, a link NLRI or a prefix NLRI.
   The corresponding BGP-LS attribute is a node attribute, a link
   attribute or a prefix attribute.  BGP-LS [RFC7752] defines the TLVs
   that map link-state information to BGP-LS NLRI and BGP-LS attribute.
   This document adds an new Node Attribute TLV called 'Node Admin Tag
   TLV' to encode node administrative tags information.

   [RFC7917] defines the 'Node Admin Tag' sub-TLV in the Router
   Capability TLV (type 242) in IS-IS Link State PDUs to encode node
   administrative tags.  Similarly [RFC7917] defines the 'Node
   Administrative Tag' TLV in OSPF Router Information LSAs to encode
   node administrative tags in OSPF Link State update packets.  The node
   administrative tags TLVs learnt from the IGP link state
   advertisements of a specific node will all be inserted in a new Node
   Admin Tag TLV and added to the corresponding Node are mapped to the
   corresponding BGP-LS Node NLRI.  Node administrative tags from IGP
   advertisements are mapped to the corresponding Node Admin Tag TLV in
   the following way.

   +----------+---------------+----------+---------------+-------------+
   | TLV Code | Description   | Length   |     IS-IS TLV |        OSPF |
   |  Point   |               |          |      /sub-TLV |     LSA/TLV |

   This new type of 'Node Admin Tag' TLVs can ONLY be added to the Node
   Attribute associated with the Node NLRI that originates the
   corresponding node administrative tags in IGP domain.

   All the node administrative tags with 'per-area' (or per-level)
   scope, originated by a single node in IGP domain SHALL be re-
   originated in a single 'Node Admin Tag' TLV and inserted in the Node
   NLRI generated for the same node.  Similarly, all the node
   administrative tags with 'global' scope originated by the same node
   in IGP domain SHALL be re-originated in another 'Node Admin Tag' TLV
   and inserted in the same Node NLRI generated for the originating
   node.  Multiple instances of a TLV may be generated by the BGP-lS
   router for a given node in the IGP domain.  This MAY happen if the
   original node's link state advertisement carries more than 16383 node
   administrative groups and a single TLV does not provide sufficient
   space.  As such multiple occurence of the 'Node Admin Tag' TLVs under
   a single BGP LS NLRI is cumulative.

   While copying node administrative tags from IGP link-state
   advertisements to corresponding BGP-LS advertisements, the said BGP-
   LS speaker MAY run all the node administrative flags through a
   locally configured policy that selects which ones should be exported
   and which ones not.  And then the node administrative tag is copied
   to the BGP-LS advertisement if it is permitted to do so by the said
   policy.

4.  Elements of Procedure

   Meaning of the Node administrative tags is generally opaque to BGP
   Link-State protocol.  Router advertising the node administrative tag
   (or tags) may be configured to do so without knowing (or even
   explicitly supporting) functionality implied by the tag.

   Interpretation of tag values is specific to the administrative domain
   of a particular network operator.  The meaning of a node
   administrative tag is defined by the network local policy and is
   controlled via the configuration.  However multiple administrative
   domain owners may agree on a common meaning implied by a
   administrative tag for mutual benefit.

   The semantics of the tag order has no meaning.  There is no implied
   meaning to the ordering of the tags that indicates a certain
   operation or set of operations that need to be performed based on the
   ordering.

   Each tag SHOULD be treated as an independent identifier that MAY be
   used in policy to perform a policy action.  Node administrative tags
   carried by the Node Admin Tag TLV SHOULD be used to indicate a

Internet-Draft          Node Admin Tags in BGP-LS          December 2016


   independent characteristics of the node in IGP domain that originated
   it.  The TLV SHOULD be considered as an unordered list.  Whilst
   policies may be implemented based on the presence of multiple tags
   (e.g., if tag A AND tag B are present), they MUST NOT be reliant upon
   the order of the tags (i.e., all policies should be considered
   commutative operations, such that tag A preceding or following tag B
   does not change their outcome).

   For more details on guidance on usage of node administrative tags
   please refer to section 4 [3] in [RFC7917].

5.  Applications

   [RFC7917] and [RFC7777] present some applications of node
   administrative tags.

   The Policy-based Explicit routing use case can be extended to inter-
   area or inter-AS scenarios where an end to end path needs to avoid or
   include nodes that have particular properties.  Following are some
   examples.

   1.  Geopolitical routing : preventing traffic from country A to
       country B to cross country C.  In this case, we may use node
       administrative tags to encode geographical information (country).
       Path computation will be required to take into account node
       administrative tag to permit avoidance of nodes belonging to
       country C.

   2.  Legacy node avoidance : in some specific cases, it is interesting
       for service-provider to force some traffic to avoid legacy nodes
       in the network.  For example, legacy nodes may not be carrier
       class (no high availability), and service provider wants to
       ensure that critical traffic only uses nodes that are providing
       high availability.

   In case of inter-AS Traffic-Engineering applications, different ASes
   SHOULD share their administrative tag policies.  They MAY also need
   to agree upon some common tagging policy for specific applications.

   For more details on some possible applications with node
   administrative tags please refer to section 3 [4] in [RFC7777].
