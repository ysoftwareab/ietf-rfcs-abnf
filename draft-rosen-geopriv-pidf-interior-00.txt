Abstract

   RFC5139 defines explicit tags for interior building location such as
   "BLD" (building), "UNIT", "ROOM".  There is wide variation in how
   interior spaces are named, and the rigid element names provided do

   the element tags defined.  This memo provides an alternative
   mechanism that provides an extensible flexible way to name spaces in
   any kind of addressible location.

Internet-Draft        Interior Location in PIDF-LO             July 2009


1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   [RFC4119] provides a way to specify an addressable civic location,
   naming the country, region, city, street name, etc.  Within that
   document is an element FLR (floor) which specifies location within
   the addressable location.  [RFC5139] extends the ability to locate
   interior spaces by defining BLD (Building), UNIT, ROOM, and SEAT.
   The problem with these elements is that there is very wide variation
   in how interior spaces are named, and these fixed elements don't
   allow one to specify interior location that matches signage, drawings
   or other conventions that are needed to properly locate targets
   within an addressable location.  An example of where the BLD/FLR/
   UNIT/ROOM doesn't work is an airport.  Interior location may be given
   as Terminal 2, Concourse A, Gate 27.

   Additionally, since interior location may vary within a structure
   (Terminal 2, Food Court, Store 13), and every building could have
   different conventions, it is essential that a way to parse a sign,
   drawing, or other representation of interior space to the elements
   needed to specify that space in a PIDF, or the reverse: creating a
   human readible string from a PIDF matching signage or drawings, it
   must be possible to specify how the conversion from human readible to
   PIDF and vice versa can be accomplished.


3.  INT element

   This memo introduces a new CAtype for PIDF-LO called "INT" (for
   interior) which has two new attributes:
     N  The locally significant name of a "level" of interior space.
        Examples include "Floor", "Concourse" and "Suite".
     R  An enumeration of how the name and value are represented in a
        human readible form.

   A PIDF-LO may have multiple INT elements.  If there are more than
   one, the order in which they appear in the PIDF can be signficant.

   The R attribute has the following values:

     B  The name is expressed before the value as in "Concourse A".
     A  The name is expressed after the value as in "Presidential
        Suite".

   If the R subelement is not present, the default value "B" is assumed.

   Editor's note: Should FLR, BLD, ROOM, ... be deprecated?  I think we
   should.


4.  Civic Address Schema

   TBD


5.  Examples

      <civicAddress xml:lang="en-AU"
        xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10:civicAddr">
        <country>AU</country>
        <A1>NSW</A1>
        <A3>Wollongong</A3>
        <A4>North Wollongong</A4>
        <RD>Flinders</RD><STS>Street</STS>
        <NAM> Video Rental Store </NAM>
        <PC>2500</PC>
        <INT N='Room' R='A'>Westerns and Classics</INT>
      </civicAddress>

      <civicAddress xml:lang="en-US"
        xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10:civicAddr">
        <country>US</country>
        <A1>PA</A1>
        <A3>Findlay</A3>
        <RD>Airport</RD><STS>RD</STS>
           <INT N='Terminal'>1</INT>
        <INT N='Concourse'>A</INT>
        <INT N='Gate'>37</INT>
      </civicAddress>


6.  Security Considerations

   The XML representation described in this document is designed for
   inclusion in a PIDF-LO document.  As such, it is subject to the same
   security considerations as are described in [RFC4119].
   Considerations relating to the inclusion of this representation in
   other XML documents are outside the scope of this document.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  XML Schema Registration

   This section replaces the existing XML namespace per the procedures
   of [RFC3688]

    URI:  urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:pidf:geopriv10:civicAddr

    Registrant Contact:  IETF, GEOPRIV working group (geopriv@ietf.org),
       Brian Rosen (brian.rosen@neustar.biz).

       The XML for this schema can be found as the entirety of Section 4
       of this document.

7.2.  CAtype Registry Update

   This document updates the civic address type registry established by
   [RFC4776].  One additional value is added:

       40      INT    Interior Location
