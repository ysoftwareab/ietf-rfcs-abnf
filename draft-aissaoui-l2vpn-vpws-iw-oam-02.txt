   2 Terminology 
      
     An end-to-end virtual circuit in a L2 VPN consists of a 3 segment 
     set: <AC, PW, AC> [L2VPN-FRMK]. Note that the AC does not need to 
     connect a CE directly to a PE. An intermediate L2 network may 
     exist. 
      
     A L2 VPN circuit is homogeneous if AC and PW types are the same. 
     E.g., ATM circuit: <ATM AC, ATM PW, ATM AC>. 
      
     A L2 VPN circuit is heterogeneous if any two segments of the 
     circuit are of different types. E.g., IP interworking circuit: 
     <ATM AC, IP PW, ATM AC>, or <ATM AC, IP PW, FR AC>. 
      
     The PW of a L2 VPN circuit can ride over three types of Packet 
     Switched Network (PSN). A PSN which makes use of LSPs as the 
     tunneling technology to forward the PW packets will be referred to 
     as a MPLS PSN. A PSN which makes use of MPLS-in-IP tunneling 
     [MPLS-in-IP], with a MPLS shim header used as PW demultiplexer, 
     will be referred to as MPLS-IP PSN. A PSN which makes use of 
     L2TPv3 [L2TPv3] as the tunneling technology will be referred to as 
     L2TP-IP PSN. 
       
   3 Introduction 
      
     This draft proposes OAM procedures for the Virtual Private 
     Wire Service (VPWS). VPWS are defined in the L2 VPN framework 
     [L2VPN-FRMK]. 
      
     The following VPWS types are covered in this document: 
      
     1. VPWS with heterogeneous ACs of ATM and FR types, and in which 
        the PW type is ATM or FR. In this case, FR-ATM service 
        interworking [FRF8.2] is performed in PE1 (or PE2) and a FR (or 
        ATM) PW is extended to the remote PE. This VPWS type will be 
        referred to as ææFR-ATM Interworking VPWSÆÆ. 
   
     2. VPWS with heterogeneous ACs of ATM, FR, and Ethernet types, and 
        in which the PW type is Ethernet. This VPWS type will be 
        referred to as ææEthernet Interworking VPWSÆÆ. 
   
     3. VPWS with heterogeneous ACs of ATM, FR, and Ethernet types, and 
        in which the PW type is IP [ARP-Mediation]. This VPWS type will 
        be referred to as ææIP Interworking VPWSÆÆ. 
      
     OAM procedures for homogeneous VPWS circuits of ATM, FR, or 
     Ethernet types are described in [OAM-MSG]. 
      
     The following topics are not covered and may be addressed in a 
     future revision of this document:

                     Figure 1: VPWS Defect Locations 
      
     The following is a brief description of the defect locations: 
      
     (a)  Defect in the first L2 network (N1). This covers any defect 
          in the N1 which impacts all or a subset of ACs terminating in 
          PE1. The defect is conveyed to PE1 and to the remote L2 
          network (N2) using a L2 specific OAM defect indication.  
     (b)  Defect on a PE1 AC interface. 
     (c)  Defect on a PE PSN interface. 
     (d)  Defect in the PSN network. This covers any defect in the PSN 
          which impacts all or a subset of the PSN tunnels and PWs 
          terminating in a PE. The defect is conveyed to the PE using a 
          PSN and/or a PW specific OAM defect indication. 
     (e)  Defect in the second L2 network (N2). This covers any defect 
          in N2 which impacts all or a subset of ACs terminating in 
          PE2. The defect is conveyed to PE2 and to the remote L2 
          network (N1) using a L2 specific OAM defect indication. 
     (f)  Defect on a PE2 AC interface. 

   4.2 VPWS OAM Interworking Models 
      
     There are two different OAM interworking models which are dictated 
     by the type of VPWS.  
      
     In a homogeneous VPWS circuit, the AC link layer is emulated by 
     the PW by extending it across the PSN. This has the implication 
    
  Aissaoui, et al.          Expires April 2005                  [Page 4]  
   
  Internet Draft draft-aissaoui-l2vpn-vpws-iw-oam-02.txt   October 2004 
   
     that the native service OAM has to operate transparently across 
     the PSN. In this case, the default OAM procedures are to use the 
     native service OAM for both the AC and PW defect indications. This 
     model is referred to as the homogeneous VPWS circuit OAM model. An 
     example of this is ATM VPWS OAM procedures. Detailed OAM 
     procedures for the homogeneous VPWS circuit types are described in 
     [OAM-MSG].   
      
     In a heterogeneous VPWS circuit, the AC link layer is terminated 
     at a PE. Therefore, the native service OAM always terminates at 
     the AC endpoint in the PE. In this case, the default OAM 
     procedures are to terminate the native service OAM and to convey 
     the corresponding defect state using a PW specific defect 
     mechanism. This model is referred to as the heterogeneous VPWS 
     circuit OAM model and is the model suitable for the VPWS types 
     covered in this document. For a MPLS PSN and a IP PSN using MPLS-
     in-IP (MPLS-IP PSN), PW status signaling messages are used for AC 
     and PW status and defect indication [PWE3-CONTROL]. For a IP PSN 
     using L2TPv3, i.e., a L2TP-IP PSN, StopCCN and CDN messages are 
     used for conveying defects in the PSN and PW respectively, while 
     the Set-Link-Info (SLI) messages are used to convey status and 
     defects in the AC and local L2 network as detailed in [OAM-MSG].  
      
     Note that the heterogeneous circuit OAM model assumes that the 
     end-to-end circuit consists of three independent segments, <AC1, 
     PW, AC2>, with defect states relayed across the boundary of these 
     segments. This has important implications for the handling of ATM 
     OAM at a PE. When a PE detects a defect in the attached ATM AC or 
     receives AIS cells as a result of a defect in the local  ATM 
     network,it will always reply with RDI cells to close the local 
     defect loop.. At the same time, the PE should always relay over 
     the PW the defect state of a received F4/F5 RDI from the local CE, 
     thus treating it as a separate defect event. These conditions 
     maintain the independence of the three defect loops while relaying 
     the defect states end-to-end. The procedures in sections 5, 6, and 
     7 satisfy these two conditions. 
      
     Finally, it may be desirable to operate ATM OAM inband in the case 
     of the FR-ATM interworking VPWS. This document proposes to use the 
     homogeneous OAM circuit model together with a ATM cell mode PW to 
     achieve this. This is explained in Section 5.  
      
     Table 1 summarizes the OAM model used with each type of VPWS 
     covered in this document.

   4.3 PW State 

   4.3.1 PW DOWN 
      
     A PE changes the state of a PW to DOWN if any of the following 
     conditions are met: 
      
     (i)    It detects a physical layer alarm on the PSN interface 
             over which the PW is riding and cannot re-establish the PW 
             over another PSN interface. 
      
     (ii)   It detects a defect in the PSN tunnel over which the PW is 
             riding.  
   
             Defects include loss of connectivity, label swapping 
             errors and label merging errors. In the case of a MPLS PSN 
             and a MPLS-IP PSN, these defects can be detected by 
             running a MPLS specific connectivity verification 
             mechanism such as LSP-Ping [LSP-Ping], BFD on a LSP [LSP-
             BFD] or Y.1711 CV [Y.1711]. This can also be the result of 
             receiving a Y.1711 FDI/BDI in a MPLS tunnel. Finally, this 
             can be the result of a PE receiving a RSVP-TE PathErr 
             message. 
   
     (iii)  It receives a message from the remote PE indicating a PW 
             defect. In the case of a MPLS PSN and a MPLS-IP PSN, this 
             is a PW status message [PWE3-CONTROL] indicating a "PW 
             Receive Fault", a "PW Transmit Fault", or a "PW not 
             forwarding".  
      
             In the case of an L2TP-IP, this is a L2TP StopCCN or CDN 
             message. A StopCCN message indicates that the control 
             connection has been shut down by the remote PE [L2TPv3]. 
             This is typically used for defects in the PSN which impact 
             both the control connection and the individual data plane 
             sessions. On reception of this message, a PE closes the 
             control connection and will clear all the sessions managed 
             by this control connection. Since each session carries a 
             single PW, the state of the corresponding PWs is changed 
             to DOWN.  
             A CDN message indicates that the remote peer requests the 
             disconnection of a specific session [L2TPv3]. In this case 
             only the state of the corresponding PW is changed to DOWN.

  Internet Draft draft-aissaoui-l2vpn-vpws-iw-oam-02.txt   October 2004 
   
             This is typically used for local defects in a PE which 
             impact only a specific session and the corresponding PW. 
   
   
     (iv)   It detects a loss of PW connectivity, including label 
             errors, via an inband PW OAM connectivity verification, 
             such as VCCV. [VCCV]describes how LSP-Ping and BFD can be 
             used over individual PWs for connectivity verification and 
             continuity checking respectively. It also specifies a 
             return path for notifying the remote PE of the PW defect. 
      
     (v)    Note that if the PW control session between the PEs fails, 
             the PW is torn down and needs to be re-established. 
             However, the consequent actions towards the ACs are the 
             same as if the PW state were DOWN.   
   
     Note that a PW is a bidirectional entity. A defect in one of the 
     directions is treated as a defect in the entire PW. 

   4.3.2 PW UP 
     For PWE3 over a MPLS PSN and a MPLS-IP PSN, a PE exits the PW DOWN 
     state when the following conditions are true:  
          
     (i)    All defects it had previously detected, as described in 
             Section 4.3.1, have disappeared, and  
     (ii)   It has received a PW Status message from its peer 
             indicating "PW Forwarding". 
          
     For a PWE3 over a L2TP-IP, a PE exits the PW DOWN state when the 
     following conditions are true: 
      
     (i)    All defects it had previously detected, as described in 
             Section 4.3.1, have disappeared, and  
     (ii)   A L2TPv3 session is successfully established to carry the 
             PW packets. 

   4.4 ATM AC State 
      
     A PE changes the state of an ATM AC to DOWN if any of the 
     following conditions are met: 
      
     (i)    It detects a physical layer alarm on the ATM interface. 
     (ii)   It receives an F4/F5 AIS/RDI OAM cell indicating that the 
             ATM VP/VC is down in the adjacent L2 ATM network (e.g., N1 
             for PE1). 
     (iii)  It detects loss of connectivity on the ATM VPC/VCC while 
             running ATM continuity checking (ATM CC) with the local 
             ATM network and CE. 
      
     A PE exits the ATM AC Down state when all defects it had 
     previously detected have disappeared. The exact conditions under 
     which a PE exits a AIS or a RDI state, or declares that

     connectivity is restored via ATM CC are explained in I.610 
     [I.610]. 
      
     Note that for a FR-ATM interworking VPWS, FRF.8.2 specifies 
     interworking for ATM VCCs only [FRF.8.2]. Therefore only F5 OAM 
     messages are relevant. 

   4.5 FR AC State 
      
     A PE changes the state of an FR AC to DOWN if any of the following 
     conditions are met: 
      
     (i)    A PVC is not ædeletedÆ from the Frame Relay network and 
             the Frame Relay network explicitly indicates in a full 
             status report (and optionally by the asynchronous status 
             message) that this Frame Relay PVC is æinactiveÆ. In this 
             case, this status maps across the PE to the corresponding 
             PW only. 
     (ii)   The LIV indicates that the link from the PE to the Frame 
             Relay network is down. In this case, the link down 
             indication maps across the PE to all corresponding PWs. 
     (iii)  A physical layer alarm is detected on the FR interface. In 
             this case, this status maps across the PE to all 
             corresponding PWs. 
     A PE exits the FR AC Down state when all defects it had previously 
     detected have disappeared. 

   4.6 Ethernet AC State 
      
     A PE changes the state of an Ethernet AC to DOWN if any of the 
     following conditions are met: 
      
     (i)    A physical layer alarm is detected on the Ethernet 
             interface. 
      
     A PE exits the Ethernet AC Down state when all defects it had 
     previously detected have disappeared. 
      
   5 OAM Procedures for FR-ATM Interworking VPWS 
      
     The FR-ATM interworking VPWS consists of interworking FR and ATM 
     ACs over the PSN, and therefore a heterogeneous OAM model applies. 
     Frame relay networks make use of PVC management over a FR UNI. 
     This is based on Q.933 Annex A [Q.933AnnexA]. ATM provides a 
     complete set of OAM capabilities which include defect indication 
     (AIS/RDI), continuity checking (CC), loopback verification (LB), 
     and performance monitoring [I.610].  
      
     For clarity of the text, it is assumed that the ACs attached to 
     PE1 in Figure 1 are of FR type. Similarly, it is assumed that the 
     ACs attached to PE2 are of ATM type. The PW type is ATM if the

     FRF.8.1 [FRF.8.1] interworking function resides in PE1. The PW 
     type is FR if it resides in PE2. 

   5.1 FR Network and Attachment Circuit Defects 

   5.1.1 FR PW and ATM PW with AAL5-mode encapsulation 
      
     For a MPLS PSN and a MPLS-IP PSN, the following procedures MUST be 
     followed when PE1 detects a defect in locations (a) or (b) as a 
     result of any of the conditions described in Section 4.5:  
      
          a. PE1 MUST change the state of the corresponding FR ACs to 
             DOWN. 
          b. PE1 MUST send a PW Status message indicating both "AC 
             Receive Fault" and "AC Transmit Fault".  
          c. On reception of the PW status message, PE2 MUST generate a 
             F5 AIS on the related ATM ACs towards CE2. 
          d. The termination point of the ATM VCC or VPC in the far-
             end, i.e., CE2, generates a F5 RDI in response to the 
             received F5 AIS.  
          e. PE2 MUST treat this as a separate defect from the original 
             remote AC defect and MUST generate a PW status message 
             indicating ææAC Transmit FaultÆÆ towards PE1. 
          f. PE1 MUST terminate the received PW status message and does 
             not perform any additional action since it is sourcing a 
             Q.933 Status Message to CE1 indicating that the 
             corresponding FR VCs are down. 
      
     For an L2TP-IP, the following procedures MUST be performed when 
     PE1 detects a defect in locations (a) or (b) as a result of any of 
     the conditions described in Section 4.5: 
      
          a. PE1 MUST change the state of the corresponding FR ACs to 
             DOWN. 
          b. PE1 MUST send an L2TP Set-Link Info (LSI) message with a 
             Circuit Status AVP indicating "inactive". 
          c. On reception of the L2TP LSI message, PE2 MUST generate a 
             F5 AIS on the related ATM ACs towards CE2. 
          d. The termination point of the ATM VCC or VPC in the far-end 
             CE, i.e., CE2, generates a F5 RDI in response to the 
             received F5 AIS.  
          e. PE2 MUST treat this as a separate defect from the original 
             remote AC defect and MUST generate an L2TP Set-Link Info 
             (LSI) message with a Circuit Status AVP indicating 
             "inactive" towards PE1.  
          f. PE1 MUST terminate the received PW status message and does 
             not perform any additional action since it is sourcing a 
             Q.933 Status Message to CE1 indicating that the 
             corresponding FR VCs are down.

   5.1.2 ATM PW with cell-mode encapsulation 
      
     If the PW type is ATM cell (N:1 or 1:1), the following procedures 
     MUST be performed: 
      
          a. PE1 MUST change the state of the corresponding FR ACs to 
             DOWN. 
          b. PE1 MUST generate an F5 AIS message and send it over the 
             PW to PE2.  
          c. PE2 MUST forward the received F5 AIS message over the ATM 
             AC.  
          d. The termination point of the ATM VCC in the far-end CE, 
             i.e., CE2, generates a F5 RDI in response to the F5 AIS. 
             PE2 MUST forward the RDI over the PW.  
          e. PE1 MUST terminate and MUST not reply to the received F5 
             RDI message since it is sourcing a Q.933 Status Message to 
             CE1 indicating that the corresponding FR VCs are down. 

   5.2 ATM Network and Attachment Circuit Defects 

   5.2.1 FR PW and ATM PW with AAL5-mode encapsulation 
      
     For a MPLS PSN and a MPLS-IP PSN, the following procedures MUST be 
     followed when PE2 detects a defect in locations (e) or (f) as a 
     result of any of the conditions described in Section 4.4:  
      
          a. PE2 MUST change the state of the corresponding ATM ACs to 
             DOWN. 
          b. PE2 MUST send a PW Status message indicating "AC Receive 
             Fault" for a received F5 AIS.  
          c. PE2 MUST send a PW status message indicating "AC Transmit 
             Fault" for a received F5 RDI.  
          d. PE2 MUST generate a F5 RDI on the related ACs towards CE2 
             in response to a received F5 AIS only. 
          e. On reception of the PW status message, PE1 MUST generate a 
             full status report with the Active bit = 0 (and optionally 
             in the asynchronous status message), as per Q.933 annex A, 
             into N1 for the corresponding FR ACs. 
      
     For an L2TP-IP, the following procedures MUST be performed when 
     PE2 detects a defect in locations (a) or (b) as a result of any of 
     the conditions described in Section 4.4: 
      
          a. PE2 MUST change the state of the corresponding ATM ACs to 
             DOWN. 
          b. PE1 MUST send an L2TP Set-Link Info (LSI) message with a 
             Circuit Status AVP indicating "inactive". 
          c. PE2 MUST generate a F5 RDI on the related ACs towards CE2 
             in response to a received F5 AIS only. 
          d. On reception of the L2TP LSI message, PE1 MUST generate a 
             full status report with the Active bit = 0 (and optionally

             in the asynchronous status message), as per Q.933 annex A, 
             into N1 for the corresponding FR ACs. 

   5.2.2 ATM PW with cell-mode encapsulation 
      
     If the PW type is ATM cell (N:1 or 1:1), the following procedures 
     MUST be performed: 
      
          a. PE2 MUST transparently carry the F5 AIS or RDI cells 
             received on the corresponding ATM AC (defect e) or the F5 
             AIS generated locally (defect f) over the corresponding 
             ATM PW. 
          b. On reception of the F5 AIS or RDI message, PE1 MUST 
             generate a full status report with the Active bit = 0 (and 
             optionally in the asynchronous status message), as per 
             Q.933 annex A, into N1 for the corresponding FR ACs.  
          c. PE1 MUST terminate a received F5 RDI message. PE1 MUST 
             generate a F5 RDI in response to a F5 AIS only and MUST 
             forward it over the PW. 
          d. On its reception, PE2 MUST forward the F5 RDI message on 
             the corresponding AC. CE2 does not reply to a received F5 
             RDI message. 

   5.3 PW Defects 

   5.3.1 FR PW and ATM PW with AAL5-mode encapsulation 
      
     For PWE3 over MPLS AND MPLS-IP, the following operations MUST be 
     performed when PE1 detects a defect in locations (c) or (d) as a 
     result of any of the conditions described in Section 4.3.1: 
      
          a. PE1 MUST change the state of the affected PWs to DOWN for 
             the direction of the defect.  
          b. PE1 MUST generate a full status report with the Active bit 
             = 0 (and optionally in the asynchronous status message), 
             as per Q.933 annex A, into N1 for the corresponding FR 
             ACs. 
          c. If both directions of the PW are down, PE1 MUST generate a 
             PW status message indicating ææPW not forwardingÆÆ. If only 
             the Transmit direction is down, PE1 MUST generate a PW 
             status message indicating ææLocal PSN-facing PW (egress) 
             Transmit FaultÆÆ. 
          d. If only the Receive direction of the PW is down, PE1 MUST 
             generate a PW status message indicating ææLocal PSN-facing 
             PW (ingress) Receive FaultÆÆ.  
          e. On reception of the a ææPW not forwardingÆÆ or a ææLocal PSN-
             facing PW (egress) Transmit FaultÆÆ  status message, PE2 
             MUST generate a F5 AIS on the affected ACs to convey this 
             status to the ATM network (N2) and CE2. On reception of a 
             ææLocal PSN-facing PW (ingress) Receive FaultÆÆ status

             message, PE2 MUST generate a F4/F5 RDI on the related ATM 
             ACs towards CE2. 
          f. CE2 replies with a F5 RDI in response to the received F5 
             AIS only. PE2 MUST terminate the F5 RDI and treat it as a 
             separate defect from the original PW defect. It MUST 
             generate a PW status message indicating ææAC Transmit 
             FaultÆÆ towards PE1.PE1 MUST terminate the received PW 
             status message and does not perform any additional action 
             since it is sourcing a Q.933 Status Message to CE1 
             indicating that the corresponding FR VCs are down.. 
      
     For PWE3 over L2TP-IP, the following operations MUST be performed 
     when PE1 detects a defect in locations (c) or (d) as a result of 
     any of the conditions described in Section 4.3.1: 
      
          a. PE1 MUST change the state of the affected PWs to DOWN for 
             both directions. 
          b. PE1 MUST generate a full status report with the Active bit 
             = 0 (and optionally in the asynchronous status message), 
             as per Q.933 annex A, into N1 for the corresponding FR 
             ACs.  
          c. PE1 MUST send an L2TPv3 CDN message or a StopCCN message 
             to inform PE2 that it had disconnected the corresponding 
             L2TPv3 sessions. 
          d. On reception of the CDN or StopCCN message, PE2 MUST 
             generate a F5 AIS on the affected ACs to convey this 
             status to the ATM network (N2) and CE2. 
          e. CE2 replies with a F5 RDI. PE2 MUST terminate the F5 RDI 
             since it has disconnected the corresponding L2TPv3 
             sessions. 
      
     When the PW state changes back to UP, a PE MUST cease the 
     generation of the F5 messages on the ATM AC towards the CE.  
     It MUST also generate a full status report (and optionally in the 
     asynchronous status message), indicating a ææactiveÆÆ status for the 
     corresponding FR AC. 
     In addition, it MUST generate a PW Status message indicating 
     ææPseudo Wire forwarding (clear all failures)ÆÆ for PWE3 over a MPLS 
     PSN and a MPLS-IP PSN. For PWE3 or an L2TP-IP, the PW UP state is 
     the result of the successful re-establishment of a L2TPv3 session 
     to carry the PW packets.. 
     This will result in clearing the alarm states in the remote PE, in 
     CE1, and in CE2. 
      
     The above procedures also apply if PE2 detects a defect in 
     locations (c) or (d) as a result of any of the conditions 
     described in Section 4.3.1. PE2 performs the same actions on the 
     PW side as PE1 in the text above but will use the ATM AC 
     procedures on the AC side instead.

     The following operations MUST be performed when PE1 detects a 
     defect in locations (c) or (d) as a result of any of the 
     conditions described in Section 4.3.1: 
      
     a. PE 1 MUST change the state of the affected PWs to DOWN.  
     b. If both directions of the PW are down or if only the Receive 
        direction of the PW is down, PE1 MUST generate a full status 
        report with the Active bit = 0 (and optionally in the 
        asynchronous status message), as per Q.933 annex A, into N1 for 
        the corresponding FR ACs. 
     c. PE1 MUST generate a F5 RDI and forward it over the PW. 
     d. PE2 will receive the F5 RDI message only if the forward 
        direction of the PW, i.e., PE1-to-PE2, is not affected by the 
        defect. In this case, PE2 MUST forward the RDI message to CE2 
        through the ATM network (N2). CE2 terminates the F5 RDI 
        message. 
      
     If only the PW Transmit direction is DOWN at PE1, this is 
     generally detected by PE2 through a PSN or a PW continuity 
     checking or connectivity verification mechanism as explained in 
     Section 4.3.1. PE1 is notified through the return path of that 
     specific mechanism. In this case, PE2 will follow the procedures 
     described below for a defect in the PW Receive direction detected 
     a PE2. If however, PE1 detects the defect in the transmit 
     direction through a time-out of a connectivity verification 
     mechanism such as LSP-Ping or VCCV-Ping, it MUST generate a PW 
     status message indicating ææLocal PSN-facing PW (egress) Transmit 
     FaultÆÆ and forward it to PE2. On reception of this message, PE2 
     will follow the same procedures described below for a defect in 
     the PW Receive direction detected at PE2. 
      
     When the PW state changes back to UP, PE1 MUST cease the 
     generation of the F5 RDI messages on the AC towards CE1. It MUST 
     also generate a full status report (and optionally in the 
     asynchronous status message), indicating a ææactiveÆÆ status for the 
     corresponding FR AC. This will result in clearing the alarm states 
     in PE1, in CE1, and in CE2. 
      
     The following procedures MUST be performed when PE2 detects a 
     defect in locations (c) or (d) as a result of any of the 
     conditions described in Section 4.3.1: 
      
     a. PE2 MUST change the state of the affected PWs to DOWN.  
     b. If both directions of the PW are down or if only the Receive 
        direction of the PW is down, PE2 MUST generate a F5 AIS on the 
        affected ACs to convey this status to the ATM network (N2) and 
        CE2. CE2 will reply with a F5 RDI messages towards PE2. 
     c. On reception of the F5 AIS message, PE1 MUST carry it over the 
        PW towards PE1. 
     d. PE1 will receive the F5 RDI message only if the forward 
        direction of the PW, i.e., PE2-to-PE1, is not affected by the 
        defect. In this case, PE1 MUST generate a full status report 
        with the Active bit = 0 (and optionally in the asynchronous

        status message), as per Q.933 annex A, into N1 for the 
        corresponding FR ACs. 
      
     If only the PW Transmit direction is DOWN at PE2, this is 
     generally detected by PE1 through a PSN or a PW continuity 
     checking or connectivity verification mechanism as explained in 
     Section 4.3.1. PE2 is notified through the return path of that 
     specific mechanism. In this case, PE1 will follow the procedures 
     described above for a defect in the PW Receive direction detected 
     at PE1. If however, PE2 detects the defect in the transmit 
     direction through a time-out of a connectivity verification 
     mechanism such as LSP-Ping or VCCV-Ping, it MUST generate a PW 
     status message indicating ææLocal PSN-facing PW (egress) Transmit 
     FaultÆÆ and forward it to PE1. On reception of this message, PE1 
     will follow the same procedures described above for a defect in 
     the PW Receive direction detected at PE1. 
      
     When the PW state changes back to UP, PE2 MUST cease the 
     generation of the F5 AIS messages over the AC towards CE2. This 
     will result in clearing the alarm state at CE2 and PE1. PE1 MUST 
     then generate a full status report (and optionally in the 
     asynchronous status message), indicating a ææactiveÆÆ status for the 
     corresponding FR AC. This will result in clearing the alarm state 
     in CE1. 
      
   6 OAM Procedures for IP Interworking VPWS 
       
     The IP interworking VPWS consists of interworking FR, ATM, and 
     Ethernet ACs over the PSN when the PW is of IP type only [ARP-
     MEDIATION].  
     For clarity of the text, it is assumed that the ACs attached to 
     PE1 in Figure 1 are of Ethernet type. Similarly, it is assumed 
     that the ACs attached to PE2 are of either Ethernet type, ATM 
     type, or FR type. 

   6.1 FR Network and Attachment Circuit Defects 
     The procedures are the same as those described in Section 5.1.1 
     when the remote AC is ATM. When the remote AC is Ethernet, the 
     same procedures apply with the exception that this document does 
     not specify procedures the remote PE performs on the Ethernet AC 
     once it is notified of the defect. If an egress PE determines that 
     all ACs on a specific Ethernet physical interface are affected, it 
     MAY propagate these alarms by bringing the entire physical 
     interface down. 

   6.2 ATM Network and Attachment Circuit Defects 
     The procedures are the same as those described in Section 5.2.1 
     when the remote AC is FR. When the remote AC is Ethernet, the same 
     procedures apply with the exception that this document does not 
     specify procedures the remote PE performs on the Ethernet AC once 
     it is notified of the defect. If an egress PE determines that all 
     ACs on a specific Ethernet physical interface are affected, it MAY

  Internet Draft draft-aissaoui-l2vpn-vpws-iw-oam-02.txt   October 2004 
   
     propagate these alarms by bringing the entire physical interface 
     down. 

   6.3 Ethernet Network and Attachment Circuit Defects 
     The following procedures MUST be followed when PE1 detects a 
     defect in locations (a)or (b), as a result of any of the 
     conditions described in Section 4.6: 
      
     a. PE1 MUST change the state of the corresponding Ethernet ACs to 
        DOWN. 
     b. PE1 MUST notify PE2 of the defect using the same PW procedures 
        described in Section 5.1.1 for a MPLS PSN, a MPLS-IP PSN, and 
        L2TP-IP PSN. 
     c. PE2 MUST follow the procedures in Section 5.1.1 for a remote 
        ATM AC or the procedures in Section 5.2.1 for a remote FR AC. 
        In the case of a remote Ethernet AC, this draft does not 
        procedures the remote PE performs on the Ethernet AC once it is 
        notified of the defect. If an egress PE determines that all ACs 
        on a specific Ethernet physical interface are affected, it MAY 
        propagate these alarms by bringing the entire physical 
        interface down. 

   6.4 PW Defects 
     When a PE detects a defect in location (c) or (d) as a result of   
     any of the conditions described in Section 4.3.1, it MUST follow 
     the following procedures:  
          a. PE1 MUST change the state of the affected PWs to DOWN for 
             the direction of the defect.  
          b. If both directions of the PW are down, PE1 MUST generate a 
             PW status message indicating ææPW not forwardingÆÆ. If only 
             the Transmit direction is down, PE1 MUST generate a PW 
             status message indicating ææLocal PSN-facing PW (egress) 
             Transmit FaultÆÆ. 
          c. If only the Receive direction of the PW is down, PE1 MUST 
             generate a PW status message indicating ææLocal PSN-facing 
             PW (ingress) Receive FaultÆÆ.  
          d. When the remote AC is ATM, PE2 and PE1 MUST follow these 
             procedures: 
              i. On reception of the a ææPW not forwardingÆÆ or a ææLocal 
                  PSN-facing PW (egress) Transmit FaultÆÆ status 
                  message, PE2 MUST generate a F5 AIS on the affected 
                  ACs to convey this status to the ATM network (N2) and 
                  CE2. On reception of a ææLocal PSN-facing PW (ingress) 
                  Receive FaultÆÆ status message, PE2 MUST generate a 
                  F4/F5 RDI on the related ATM ACs towards CE2. 
             ii. CE2 replies with a F5 RDI in response to the received 
                  F5 AIS only. PE2 MUST terminate the F5 RDI and treat 
                  it as a separate defect from the original PW defect. 
                  It MUST generate a PW status message indicating ææAC 
                  Transmit FaultÆÆ towards PE1.PE1 MUST terminate the 
                  received PW status message and does not perform any 
                  additional.

  Internet Draft draft-aissaoui-l2vpn-vpws-iw-oam-02.txt   October 2004 
   
          e. When the remote AC is FR, PE2 MUST follow these 
             procedures: 
            iii. On reception of the a ææPW not forwardingÆÆ or a ææLocal 
                  PSN-facing PW (egress) Transmit FaultÆÆ status 
                  message, PE2 MUST generate a full status report with 
                  the Active bit = 0 (and optionally in the 
                  asynchronous status message), as per Q.933 annex A, 
                  into N2 for the corresponding FR ACs. 
      
          f. When the remote AC is Ethernet, PE2 MUST follow these 
             procedures: 
             iv. On reception of the a ææPW not forwardingÆÆ or a ææLocal 
                  PSN-facing PW (egress) Transmit FaultÆÆ status 
                  message, PE2 marks the state of the PW to DOWN for 
                  the direction of the defect. No further procedures 
                  are defined in this document. 
      
     For PWE3 over L2TP-IP, the following operations MUST be performed 
     when PE1 detects a defect in locations (c) or (d) as a result of 
     any of the conditions described in Section 4.3.1: 
      
          a. PE1 MUST change the state of the affected PWs to DOWN for 
             both directions. 
          b. PE1 MUST send an L2TPv3 CDN message or a StopCCN message 
             to inform PE2 that it had disconnected the corresponding 
             L2TPv3 sessions. 
          c. When the remote AC is ATM, PE2 and PE1 MUST follow these 
             procedures: 
              i. On reception of the CDN or StopCCN message, PE2 MUST 
                 generate a F5 AIS on the affected ACs to convey this 
                 status to the ATM network (N2) and CE2. 
             ii. CE2 replies with a F5 RDI. PE2 MUST terminate the F5 
                 RDI since it has disconnected the corresponding L2TPv3 
                 sessions. 
          d. When the remote AC is FR, PE2 MUST follow these 
             procedures: 
              i. On reception of the CDN or StopCCN message, PE2 MUST 
                 generate a full status report with the Active bit = 0 
                 (and optionally in the asynchronous status message), 
                 as per Q.933 annex A, into N2 for the corresponding FR 
                 ACs. 
          e. When the remote AC is Ethernet, PE2 MUST follow these 
             procedures: 
              i. On reception of the CDN or StopCCN message, PE2 marks 
                 the state of the PW to DOWN. No further procedures are 
                 defined in this document. 
      
      
     When the PW state changes back to UP, a PE MUST cease the 
     generation of the F5 messages on the ATM AC towards the CE. It 
     MUST also generate a full status report (and optionally in the 
     asynchronous status message), indicating a ææactiveÆÆ status for the 
     corresponding FR AC. No procedures are defined for an Ethernet AC.

  Internet Draft draft-aissaoui-l2vpn-vpws-iw-oam-02.txt   October 2004 
   
     In addition, it MUST generate a PW Status message indicating 
     ææPseudo Wire forwarding (clear all failures)ÆÆ for PWE3 over a MPLS 
     PSN and a MPLS-IP PSN. For PWE3 or an L2TP-IP, the PW UP state is 
     the result of the successful re-establishment of a L2TPv3 session 
     to carry the PW packets. 
     This will result in clearing the alarm states in the remote PE, in 
     CE1, and in CE2. 
      
   7 OAM Procedures for Ethernet Interworking VPWS 
       
     The Ethernet interworking VPWS consists of interworking FR, ATM, 
     and Ethernet ACs over the PSN when the PW is of Ethernet type 
     only. 
      
     The OAM procedures for this VPWS type are the same as those for 
     the IP Interworking VPWS. See Section 6 for details.  
      
   8 Security Considerations 
      
     This draft does not introduce any new security considerations to 
     VPWS. Though, it is worth mentioning that in the heterogeneous 
     VPWS OAM model, a flooding of alarms on the ACs may result in a 
     large number of PW status signaling messages generated. This may 
     have an impact on the performance of the MPLS control plane. This 
     issue should be investigated and solutions should be provided if 
     required. A method for aggregating PW status messages is one 
     possible solution.
