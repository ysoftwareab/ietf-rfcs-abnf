Abstract

   This document attempts to discuss and clarify the text in [OSPFv2] and
   [OSPFv3], about dealing with unknown link types in router LSA's.

1.  Problem Definition

   The text in [OSPFv2] and [OSPFv3] does not state how to treat unknown 
   link types when present in Router LSA's.

   Link-state Routing assumes that an OSPF router maintains an identical
   database describing the Autonomous System's topology. Incase the a 
   Router LSA with an unknown link type is received implementations treat
   the LSA differently. While some implementations can ignore the link 
   yet process the rest of the LSA others can simply ignore the LSA. This 
   leads to different databases in the routers and hence different routing
   tables.  



2.  Changes for OSPFv2


   Section 12.4.1 [OSPFv2] describes the various values used to Link-types 
   in Router LSA's. The values 1, 2, 3 and 4 are defined. 

   If a Router LSA with an unknown link-type is being processed, the link 
   is ignored and the rest of the router LSA is processed normally.
   
   Section 16.1 (2)(a) [OSPFv2]  should now read

                If this is a link to a stub network, examine the next
                link in V's LSA.  Links to stub networks will be
                considered in the second stage of the shortest path
                calculation. If the link type is unknown examine the
                next link in V's LSA. Unknown Link Types are ignored.



3.  Changes for OSPFv3

    
    Section A.4.3 [OSPFv3] described the various values of Link-types in 
    Router LSA's/ The values 1, 2 and 4 are defined to be used in routing 
    table calculations, while 3 is reserved.

Internet-Draft     Treating unknown Router-LSA link types   November 2004



    If a Router-LSA with an unknown or reserved link-type is being processed, 
    the link is ignored and the rest of the router LSA is processed normally.

    Section 3.8.1 [OSPFv3] remains unchanged as it Refers to Section 16.1,
    [OSPFv2].



4.  Security Considerations


   This document doesn't raise any new security concerns other than
   those covered in [OSPFv2] and [OSPFv3].
