             Additional CoAP Binding and Observe Attributes
                      draft-groves-core-obsattr-00

Abstract

   [I-D.ietf-core-dynlink] defines five CoAP Observaton attributes
   (minimum period, maximum period, band step, less than and greater
   than) to control when notifications are sent.  These attributes are
   insufficient for some use cases.  This document specifies additional
   attributes allowing for notification bands, initialization values,
   band step, sample number window and sample time window to allow for a
   wider range of use cases.

1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-core-dynlink] defines five CoAP Binding and Observaton
   attributes (minimum period, maximum period, change step, less than
   and greater than) to control when notifications are sent.  The
   currently defined attributes have characteristics that means some use
   cases cannot be supported.  These are described below:

   o  A transition across a less than (lt), or greater than (gt) limit
      or a change step (st) only generates one notification.  This means
      that it is not possible to describe a case where multiple
      notifications are sent so long as the limit is exceeded.

   o  The change step (st) value is not deterministic when setting the
      attribute.  A client cannot set the initial value that the change
      step applies to.  The change step is based on the initial value
      sent by the server.  This means that a client cannot indicate that
      it wants the change step (st=10) to apply to a certain increment
      (e.g. 10, 20, 30) instead it relies on the initial value from the
      client.  Thus a change step of 10 could result in reporting (11,
      21, 31) or equally (15, 27, 53).

   o  SenML allows for multiple values (records) to be reported for a
      resource.  The current attributes do not allow a method for a
      client to request a particular number of records or sample time
      window.

   In order to allow a more complete set of use cases to be supported
   this specification introduces several new attributes.

   The notification band attributes "Notification Band Minimum" (bmn)
   and "Notification Band Maximum" (bmx) attributes allow a bounded or
   unbounded (based on a minimum or maximum) value range that may
   trigger multiple state synchronizations.  This enables use cases
   where different ranges results in differing behaviour.  For example:
   monitoring the temperature of machinery.  Whilst the temperature is
   in the normal operating range only periodic observations are needed.
   However as the temperature moves to more abnormal ranges more
   frequent synchronization/reporting may be needed.

   An "Initialization Value" (iv) attribute allows a seed value for the
   calculation of the change step to be specified.  This allows use
   cases where synchronization occurs around a known value.  For
   example: synchronization will occur based on the operating
   temperature set point of a machine.  Without the initialization
   synchronization will occur around the first measured value.

   A "Band Step" (bst) attribute defines a series of bands that will
   trigger state synchronization.  This allows use cases where state
   synchronization is required against known levels.  Rather than
   synchronizing based on a difference to a previous synchronization
   value, synchronization occurs against a fixed known level.  For
   example: it allows state sychronisation for a sensor when it's value
   is between (5,10],(10,15],(15,20] etc.

   The "Sample Number Window" (snw) attribute allows a number of state
   synchronizations to be queued before the actual queue synchronization
   occurs.  Once the number of queued state synchronizations has reached
   a certain level then a single queue synchronization occurs with the
   multiple resource values related to individual state synchronizations
   included.  This allows use cases where multiple resource values are
   required but frequent synchronization is not required as there is a
   need to minimise resource usage.  For example: a meter may need to be
   recorded once an hour but the values only need to be synchronized
   once a day.

   The "Sample Time Window" (stw) attribute as per the sample number
   window allows state synchronizations to be queued before the actual
   queue synchronization occurs.  The queue synchronization occurs when
   the indicated period expires independent of the number of samples.

3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this specification are to be interpreted as described
   in [RFC2119].

   This specification requires readers to be familiar with all the terms
   and concepts that are discussed in [RFC5988] and [RFC6690].  This
   specification makes use of the following additional terminology:

   Notification Band:  A resource value range that results in state
      sychronization.  The value range may be bounded by a minimum and
      maximum value or may be unbounded having either a minimum or
      maximum value.

4.  Binding and Resource Observation Attributes

   The attributes defined in this section are additional attributes that
   may be used as binding attributes (3.3/[I-D.ietf-core-dynlink]) and
   resource observation attributes (4.2/[I-D.ietf-core-dynlink]).

   This specification introduces several new attributes:

              Table 1: Resource Observation Attribute Summary

   The attributes may only be included at most once in a query.

4.1.  Initialization Value (iv)

   The attribute indicates the initialization value to be used to
   determine when a change step is notified.  As such it MUST only be
   present in a query when the change step (st) or band step (bst)
   attribute is present (see [I-D.ietf-core-dynlink]).  If st or bst is
   not present then the receiver MUST return a CoAP error code 4.00 "Bad
   Request" (or equivalent).

   Without iv, on reception of a query the synchronization initiator
   uses the current value for the observed resource as the initial value
   to which the change step is applied.  The use of iv overrides this
   behaviour and the iv value is used for the initial value (STinit or
   BSTinit).  A state synchronization occurs once the resource value
   differs from the initial value by the change step value (i.e.
   CurrVal >= STinit + ST or CurrVal <= STint - ST).  The initial value
   is then set to the state synchronization value.

   A state synchronization due to Pmax (or Pmin) does not cause an
   update of the initial value.  However once the initial value is
   updated by a state synchronization due to the other attributes in the
   query then the normal behaviour defined by
   3.3.7/[I-D.ietf-core-dynlink] occurs.

Internet-Draft             CoAP Observe Attr.              February 2017


4.2.  Notification Band Minimum (bmn)

   This attribute defines the lower bound for the notification band.
   State synchronization occurs when the resource value is equal to or
   above the notification band minimum.  This attribute is optional.  If
   not present there is no minimum value for the band.  If present bmn
   must be less than bmx if it is also present otherwise the receiver
   MUST return a CoAP error code 4.00 "Bad Request" (or equivalent).

4.3.  Notification Band Maximum (bmx)

   This attribute defines the upper bound for the notification band.
   State synchronization occurs when the resource value is equal to or
   less than the notification band maximum.  This attribute is optional.
   If not present there is no maximum value for the band.  If present
   bmx must be more than bmn if it is also present, otherwise the
   receiver MUST return a CoAP error code 4.00 "Bad Request" (or
   equivalent).

4.4.  Band Step (bst)

   Like change step (st) this attribute indicates how much the value of
   a resource SHOULD change before triggering a state synchronization.
   The difference however is that the values used for the band step
   calculation are based on a constant step rather than being based on
   the synchronized value.

   The current resource value or the initialization value (if provided)
   is used a seed to determine the band thresholds.

   For example: Given a bst=10 and an initialization value=25.  This
   defines a series of band step thresholds: i.e. ...,
   (5,15],(15,25],(25,35], ...

   When the resource value enters a new band step by exceeding the
   minimum threshold value and being less than or equal to the maximum
   threshold value for a band step then synchronisation occurs.

   A new synchronization occurs whenever the value enters a new band
   step.  If the value jumps across band steps e.g. from 13 to 27 only
   one synchronisation occurs.

   The band step MUST be greater than zero otherwise the server MUST
   return a CoAP error code 4.00 "Bad Request" (or equivalent).

   Change step (st) and band step (bst) MUST NOT occur together in the
   same query.

4.5.  Sample Number Window

   If queuing of a number of state synchronizations are required then
   the sample number window attribute is set to the desired size of the
   window.  The attribute may be set with valid combinations of other
   binding/resource observation attributes.  When a state
   synchronization is triggered due to the other attributes the resource
   value is added to the list of samples instead of resulting in an
   update of the source and destination resource (state
   synchronization).  Only when the number of samples in the window
   reaches the sample number window is a state sycnhronisation peformed
   for the resource.  The samples are then flushed from the window and
   the process is repeated.

   The use of the sample number window attribute may require the use of
   a suitable content-format (such as SenML [I-D.ietf-core-senml]) that
   allows multiple values/data points to be specified during the state
   synchronization.

   Consideration should also be given to the resource capacity (i.e.
   memory) of the CoAP server for storing data associated with the
   sample window.  The sample number window should not exceed its
   capabilities.  Even if the sample number window has not been reached,
   if resource (memory) consumption is an issue then state
   synchronization for the stored resource values SHOULD occur enabling
   resources to be freed.

   The pmin and pmax attributes have an indirect effect on the overall
   state sychronization.  Whilst pmin and pmax do not directly specify
   the period for the overall state sychronization the setting of pmin
   and pmax may trigger samples entering the sample window as thus
   affect the frequency of state synchronization.

4.6.  Sample Time Window

   If state synchronizations are to be queued during a certain period of
   time (in seconds) then the sample time window attribute is used.  The
   attribute may be set with valid combinations of other binding/
   resource observation attributes.  On reception of a query with the
   stw attribute a timer (T1=0) is started.  Whilst T1<stw when a state
   synchronization is triggered due to the other attributes, the
   resource value is added to the sample window instead of resulting in
   a state synchronization.  When the time expires e.g.  T1=stw the
   state sychronization for the resource occurs.  The window is then
   flushed, T1 is re-started and the process is repeated.

   The use of the sample time window attribute may require the use of a
   suitable content-format (such as SenML [I-D.ietf-core-senml]) that

Internet-Draft             CoAP Observe Attr.              February 2017


   allows multiple values/data points to be specified during the
   synchronization.

   Consideration should also be given to the resource capacity (i.e.
   memory) of the CoAP server for storing data associated with the time
   window.  Consideration should be given to that the expected frequency
   of adding resource values and length of the time doesn't exceed the
   memory capacity of the server.  Even if the sample time window has
   not been reached, if resource (memory) consumption is an issue then
   state synchronization for the stored resource values SHOULD occur
   enabling resources to be freed.

4.7.  Interactions

   To enable an notification band at least bmn or bmx MUST be set.  If
   both bmn and bmx are set then a finite band is specified.  State
   synchronization occurs whenever the resource value is between bmn and
   bmx or is equal to bmn or bmx.  If only one attribute bmx or bmn is
   set then the band has an open bound.  That is all values above bmn or
   all values below bmx will be synchronized.

   When using multiple resource bindings (e.g. multiple Observations of
   resource) with different bands, consideration should be given to the
   resolution of the resource value when setting sequential bands.  For
   example: Given BandA (Abmn=10, Bbmx=20) and BandB (Bbmn=21, Bbmx=30).
   If the resource value returns an integer then notifications for
   values between and inclusive of 10 and 30 will be triggered.  Whereas
   if the resolution is to one decimal point (0.1) then notifications
   for values 20.1 to 20.9 will not be triggered.

   Note: The use of bmn and bmx allow for a synchronization whenever a
   change in the resource value occurs.  Theoretically this could occur
   in-line with the server internal sample period for the determining
   the resource value.  Implementors SHOULD consider the resolution
   needed before updating the resource, e.g. updating the resource when
   a temperature sensor value changes by 0.001 degree versus 1 degree.

   If pmin and pmax are present in a query then they take precedence
   over the other parameters.  Thus even if bmn and bmx are met if pmin
   has not been exceeded then no state synchronization occurs.  Likewise
   if bmn and bmx have not been met and pmax time has expired then state
   synchronization occurs.  The current value of the resource is used
   for the synchronization.  If pmin time is exceeded and bmn and bmx
   are met then the current value of the resource is synchronized.  If
   st is also included, a state synchronization resulting from pmin or
   pmax updates STinit with the synchronized value.  If bst is included,
   a state synchronization resulting from pmin or pmax updates bstinit
   with the closest bst delta value as per Section 4.4.

   It is an error to include a greater than (gt) or less than (lt)
   attribute in a query containing bmn or bmx.

   If change step (st) is included in a query with bmn or bmx then state
   synchronization will occur whilst the resource value is in the
   notification band AND the resource value differs from STinit by the
   change step.

   If band step (bst) is included in a query with bmn or bmx then state
   synchronization will occur whilst the resource value is in the
   notification band defined by bmn or bmx AND has entered a new
   bandstep band.

   If bst is included in a query with a gt or lt attribute then state
   synchronizations occur only when the conditions described by bst AND
   gt or bst AND lt are met.

   If bst is included in a query with a iv attribute then iv is used to
   calculate the band thresholds.  Subsequent state synchronizations are
   as per Section 4.4.

   If iv is included with the bmn and bmx or gt and lt attributes it has
   no affect on the synchronisation.  If bst is also used then it used
   to calculate band step thresholds.  If st is instead used then it is
   used to calculate the initial value.

   The snw and stw attributes SHALL not be used in the same query
   together.  Synchronizations based on pmin and pmax are added to the
   snw/stw sample window.  In effect this overrides the pmin and pmax
   mechanism because resource state synchronizations will not occur
   between the source and destination resources based on these
   parameters.  For snw the minimum period will be snw * pmin.  The
   maximum period will be snw * pmax.  For stw the state synchronization
   will occur after time stw and is not dependent on pmin and pmax
   (unless a state synchronization occurs due to memory constraints).
   The stw must be more than pmax if it is present, otherwise the pmax
   attribute becomes invalid.

   o  STinit being set to 20 due to iv.

   o  A state synchronization through an Observe:

      *  Every 60 seconds if the value is not between 20 and 40 and if
         the value has not changed by 5 from 20

      *  When the temperature is equal to or between 20 and 40 and the
         value has changed by 5 from STinit at least every 10 seconds.

Internet-Draft             CoAP Observe Attr.              February 2017


4.8.4.  Example 4 - Step and Initialization Value

   Req: POST /bnd/ (Content-Format: application/link-format)
   <coap://sensor.example.com/s/temperature>; rel="boundto";anchor="/a/
   temperature";bind="obs";pmin="10";pmax="60";st="5",iv="20"

   Res: 2.04 Changed

   The above will result in:

   o  STinit being set to 20 due to iv.

   o  A state synchronization through an Observe:

      *  Every 60 seconds if the temperature does not differ from STinit
         by 5.

      *  When the temperature differs from STinit by 5 at least every 10
         seconds.

4.8.5.  Example 5 - Band Minimum and Maximum, Band Step and Initial
        Value

   Req: POST /bnd/ (Content-Format: application/link-format)
   <coap://sensor.example.com/s/temperature>; rel="boundto";anchor="/a/t
   emperature";bind="obs";pmin="10";pmax="60";bmn="20",bmx="40",bst="5",
   iv="15"

   Res: 2.04 Changed

   The above will result in:

   o  A series of bands being created of a width of 5 with the seed
      value 15.  Given bmn="20" and bmx="40" this effectively means that
      bands with the following
      thresholds(15,20],(20,25],(25,30],(30,35],(35,40] are created.

   o  A state synchronization through an Observe:

      *  Every 60 seconds if the value is not between 20 and 40
         (inclusive) and if the value has not entered into a new band.

      *  When the temperature is equal to or between 20 and 40 and the
         value changes between the bands at least every 10 seconds.

4.8.6.  Example 6 - Band Minimum and Sample Number Window

   Req: POST /bnd/ (Content-Format: application/link-format)
   <coap://sensor.example.com/s/temperature>; rel="boundto";anchor="/a/
   temperature";bind="obs";pmin="10";pmax="60";bmn="50";snw="5"

   Res: 2.04 Changed

   The above will result in:

   o  A state sychronization added to the queue at pmax or whenever the
      value changes and is equal to or above 50.

   o  A state sychronization through an Observe occuring once 5
      synchronizations have been added to the queue resulting in
      multiple values being synchronized between the source and
      destination resources.

5.  Security Considerations

   As per 5/[I-D.ietf-core-dynlink].

6.  IANA Considerations

   None.
