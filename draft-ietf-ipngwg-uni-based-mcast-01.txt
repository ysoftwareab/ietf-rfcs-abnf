Abstract 
    
   This specification defines an extension to the multicast addressing 
   architecture of the IP Version 6 protocol.  The extension presented 
   in this document allows for unicast-prefix-based allocation of 
   multicast addresses. 
    
    
1. Introduction 
    
   This document specifies an extension to the multicast portion of the 
   IPv6 addressing architecture [RFC 2373].  The current architecture 
   does not contain any built-in support for dynamic address 
   allocation.  This proposal introduces encoded information in the 
   multicast address to allow for dynamic, network prefix-based 
   allocation of IPv6 multicast addresses, as well as allocation of 
   source-specific multicast addresses. 
    
 
2. Multicast Address Format 
    
   Section 2.7.2 of RFC 2373 defines the following operational format 
   of IPv6 multicast addresses:

Internet Draft   Unicast Prefix-based IPv6 Multicast      August 2000 
    
    
     |    8   |  4 |  4 |               80               |     32     | 
     +--------+----+----+--------------------------------+------------+ 
     |11111111|flgs|scop|     reserved must be zero      | group ID   | 
     +--------+----+----+--------------------------------+------------+ 
    
    
   This document introduces a new format that incorporates unicast 
   prefix information in the multicast address.  The following 
   illustrates the new format: 
    
    
     |   8    |  4 |  4 |   8    |    8   |       64       |    32    | 
     +--------+----+----+--------+--------+----------------+----------+ 
     |11111111|flgs|scop|reserved|  plen  | network prefix | group ID | 
     +--------+----+----+--------+--------+----------------+----------+ 
    
    
    
                                   +-+-+-+-+ 
   flgs is a set of 4 flags:       |0|0|P|T| 
                                   +-+-+-+-+ 
    
           o P = 0 indicates a multicast address that is not assigned 
              based on the network prefix. 
           o P = 1 indicates a multicast address that is assigned 
              based on the network prefix. 
           o The setting of the T bit is defined in Section 2.7 of RFC 
              2373 
    
   The reserved field MUST be zero. 
    
   plen indicates the actual length of the network prefix portion of 
   the address when P = 1.  This field is required in order to 
   determine the number of bits to include as part of the unicast 
   prefix. 
    
   network prefix identifies the network prefix of the unicast subnet 
   owning the multicast address.  If P = 1, this field contains the 
   unicast network prefix defined in [RFC 2374] and assigned to the 
   domain owning, or allocating, the multicast address. 
    
   With the network prefix-based architecture and the current unicast 
   address architecture [RFC 2374], the network prefix portion of the 
   multicast address will be at most 64 bits. 
    
   The scope of the unicast-prefix based multicast address must not 
   exceed the scope of the unicast prefix embedded in the multicast 
   address. 
    
    
3. Source-Specific Multicast Addresses

Internet Draft   Unicast Prefix-based IPv6 Multicast      August 2000 
    
    
   The network prefix-based IPv6 multicast address format supports 
   Source-specific multicast addresses, as defined by [IANA].  This is 
   accomplished by: 
    
           o Setting P = 1 
           o Setting plen = 0 
           o Setting network prefix = 0 
    
    
4. Security Considerations 
    
   Using unicast network-prefix based multicast addresses can sometimes 
   aid in identifying the allocation domain of a given multicast 
   address, although no guarantee is provided. 
    
   Using source-specific multicast addresses can sometimes aid in the 
   prevention of denial-of-service attacks by arbitrary sources, 
   although no guarantee is provided. 
    
    
5. IANA Considerations 
    
   Well-known, fixed-scope and variable-scope multicast addresses with 
   the prefix FF2x (unicast-prefix based, permanent) may be created and 
   used as follows. 
    
   Group IDs are defined and registered by the IANA.  Such well-known 
   group IDs may be used to create unicast-prefix based multicast 
   addresses by any domain or network by embedding their local unicast 
   prefix.  Hence, given an IANA-assigned group ID, and a unicast 
   network prefix, an application could derive and join that network's 
   group used for the well-known purpose associated with the group ID.
