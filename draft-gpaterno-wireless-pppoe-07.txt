Internet-Draft  Using PPPoE to authenticate Wireless LANs   January 2003


1. Introduction

   Current wireless LANs technologies provide a feeble security
   architecture that can be broken by motivated malicious users.
   Moreover, these technologies are not able to uniquely identify the
   user that is accessing the network: as a result corporations, ISPs,
   and mobile operators are unable to apply appropriate rights and/or
   services to end-users.

   This document proposes the adoption of the Point-To-Point Protocol
   over Ethernet (PPPoE) as an authentication methodology in wireless
   LANs and as an additional security component. Furthermore, it
   explores how consumers, corporations, ISPs, and mobile operators
   would benefit from the adoption of PPPoE as an alternative solution
   to IEEE 802.1X.


2. Current Wireless LANs scenario

   Increased personal mobility and need for network coverage in open
   spaces or in places where cabling is difficult (such as airports,
   hospitals, warehouses or old buildings) has accelerated the
   development of several wireless solutions.  Different technologies
   exist for transmitting data "over-the-air", for example GSM Packet
   Radio Service (GPRS), Bluetooth, and IEEE 801.11, also known as
   Wireless Ethernet or Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi).

2.1. Wireless standard IEEE 802.11 and security concerns

   Currently the most successful technology in wireless LANs is IEEE
   802.11 [10], due to its easy configuration, flexibility, and
   cost/performance ratio.  In particular, the extension named IEEE
   802.11b [15] (also known as 802.11 High Rate or Wi-Fi), was one of
   the 1999 ratifications of the original 802.11 standard and it allowed
   for wireless functionality comparable to Ethernet.

   IEEE 802.11 focuses mainly on Wireless LAN Medium Access Control
   (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) specifications, but it defines also an
   optional security feature in the form of encryption, named the Wired
   Equivalent Privacy (WEP).  WEP was initially developed to give end
   users a protection comparable with that of wired network. Recent
   studies, such as [9] and [11], demonstrated however that a malicious
   user might gain access to the network by breaking the WEP keys and
   without ever needing to supply additional credentials after that. WEP
   is based on the RC4 [17] encryption algorithm, a function that
   generates a pseudo-random infinitive streaming cypher by suppling two
   arguments: the actual WEP key (referred to as K), that may be 40 or
   104 bits long, and the Initial Vector (referred to as IV), that is 24



G. Paterno'                   Experimental                      [Page 3]

Internet-Draft  Using PPPoE to authenticate Wireless LANs   January 2003


   bits long. Each IEEE 802.11 frame payload contains both the IV in
   clear and cyphertext data: cyphertext data are obtained by applying
   XOR between the RC4 (IV, K) resulting stream and the clear text.
   Moreover, when a frame is transmitted a new IV is generated: as the
   IV has 16777216 possible values (2^24), the number of IV would be
   repeated (i.e. it would collide) every 5 hours by constantly
   transmitting at 11 Mb/s. With about 1500 IV collisions, and with a
   probabilistic attack to the RC4 algorithm, it is possible to decrypt
   the transmission and derive the original WEP key. Document [12]
   describes in detail the weaknesses of the RC4 algorithm, while
   document [11] explains how such weaknesses can be used to break WEP.

   The Wired Equivalent Privacy gives therefore a false security feeling
   to end-users as sensitive data, not encrypted in the presentation
   layer (e.g. through SSL), can be easily eavesdropped by motivated
   malicious users.

   Using layer 3 network addresses over the wireless LANs raises also
   some concerns. For example the use of DHCP might be a disadvantage
   for those service providers unable to uniquely identify a specific
   user, typically for authorisation and accounting purposes.  We must
   also consider that, once a malicious user gains access to the WEP
   keys, DHCP immediately gives an IP address and network information to
   the intruder (e.g. DNS, WINS, routing, etc.).

   Many manufacturers of Access Points (AP) introduced an additinal
   security feature known as MAC filtering.  APs were enabled to
   identify MAC addresses of the network cards allowed to access the AP
   itself. The use of MAC addresses presents some issues. First one of
   manageability: if a user changes his/her wireless adapter, for
   example to replace a broken one, he/she must contact the ISP and
   communicate his/her new MAC address.  Secondly, network cards MAC
   addresses can be easily changed by malicious users to find out the
   ones with access permissions and so gain access to the Wireless LAN.

2.2. Existing authentication methodologies

   The IEEE 802.1X standard [2], based on Extensive Authentication
   Protocol Over Lan (EAPOL), aimed at addressing the security issues of
   Wireless LANs. This protocol provides user authentication for both
   wireless and wireline LANs: it allows unique user identification and
   therefore makes it possible to provide personalised services such as
   grouping of users in specific Virtual LANs.

   While the enhancements proposed by both IEEE 802.1X and the work-in-
   progress IEEE 802.11i could improve security of 802.11 networks,
   these solutions came on the market too late, causing impatient
   vendors to implement proprietary ad-hoc solutions. These vendors may



G. Paterno'                   Experimental                      [Page 4]

Internet-Draft  Using PPPoE to authenticate Wireless LANs   January 2003


   not be willing to replace their proprietary fixes with 802.11i when
   it will become available.

   Many of the high-end AP manufacturers anyway embraced the IEEE 802.1X
   standard, sometimes with proprietary extensions: although 802.1X
   provides flexibility and extended LAN support, compliant APs are
   still quite expensive for small businesses and consumers. In fact, to
   this day, many of the Wireless Access Points and hub/switches do not
   support EAPOL.  Furthermore, many APs which are 802.1X compliant do
   not implement the dynamic WEP-key exchange feature [2] (EAPOL-Key),
   thus raising a potential security issues.

   A great number of consumers, of small ISPs and of small businesses
   cannot afford such an expensive solution, but nevertheless they need
   security and need to be able to uniquely identify users who can
   access their resources.  In fact, some malicious users are today
   gaining access to users' home equipment through Wireless LANs, and
   attacking remote sites while fully preserving their anonymity.

   It also has to be considered that many ISPs and mobile operators are
   not interested in implementing encryption for wireless connections,
   e.g. connections for public Internet access, but nevertheless they
   need unique user identification for billing purposes. The ideal
   solution for ISPs and mobile operators would then be one that easily
   and with little effort integrates with their existing dial-up
   infrastructure (e.g. modem, GPRS, etc.), while enabling end users to
   access customised services such as fixed IP address, Quality of
   Service, etc.

3. Proposed solution

3.1. A layered approach

   The adoption of a layered approach is a valid methodology to analyse
   computer-related issues: it is easier to solve a problem when it is
   analysed into smallest "blocks" or "layers", for example in the OSI
   specifications.

   The advantage of using this methodology in Wireless LANs, therefore
   analysing physical/data link, authentication, and encryption
   separately, is that the resulting framework  would allow changes in
   one layer to occur without affecting the others. As a result, as soon
   as Wireless LANs, e.g. IEEE 802.11, will evolve and new standards
   become available, authentication and encryption will remain
   unchanged, or vice versa.

   The schema below summaries the proposed authentication layer and the
   resulting framework:


   +-------+ +-------+ +----------------+
   | HTTPS | | IMAPS | | Other secure   |        Application Layer
   |       | |       | | protocol (TLS) |
   +-------+ +-------+ +----------------+

   +-------+ +------------+ +-----------+
   | IPSec | |   Other    | | MPPE/ECP  |
   |       | | encryption | |  (3DESE)  |        Encryption Layer
   +-------+ +------------+ |    PPP    |        (optional)
                            | extension |
   +------------------------+           |
   |        Point-To-Point Protocol     |        Authentication Layer
   +------------------------------------+

   +--------+ +----------+ +------------+
   | 802.11 | | HyperLAN | | Other WLAN |        Physical/Data Link Layer
   +--------+ +----------+ +------------+


3.2. The authentication layer: PPPoE

   With the introduction of cable and ADSL technologies, ISPs have
   adopted a methodology for resolving the authentication layer problem
   for the broadband world.

   ADSL and cable technologies are able to emulate an ethernet network
   in their standard configuration. Although DHCP is easy to deploy for



G. Paterno'                   Experimental                      [Page 6]

Internet-Draft  Using PPPoE to authenticate Wireless LANs   January 2003


   a Service Provider, and to configure from an user perspective, it
   does not provide a way to authenticate the user, and therefore cannot
   be used for accounting or authorization.

   This need was solved with the introduction of the Point-To-Point over
   Ethernet protocol (PPPoE), described in [1].  Through the adoption of
   this protocol, access control, billing, and several type of services
   can be performed on a per-user, rather than a per-site or cell basis.

   In a similar way to the previous broadband technologies, 802.11 is
   able to emulate an ethernet network.  The idea then is to apply PPPoE
   technology to Wireless LANs. The advantage is clear: consumers,
   corporations, Internet Service Providers, and mobile operators can
   perform authentication, authorisation, and accounting easily on the
   wireless users without adding new components and, more importantly,
   with little effort.

   There are several advantages of embracing the PPPoE technology, one
   of them is providing fixed IP addresses and specific Quality Of
   Service (QoS) to a roaming wireless user: wherever the user is
   located, he/she can have his/her IP address and his/her personalised
   services.

   In addition, it has to be considered that the use of PPP will
   introduce another obstacle to malicious users, who would have to
   break both the WEP and the PPP layer to gain access to the IP-based
   network.  Passwords must not be exchanged through the Password
   Authentication Protocol (PAP) between the user and the PPPoE
   concentrator, because PAP transmits passwords in cleartext: a
   stronger protocol such as MS-CHAPv2 [4], EAP-TLS [5] or better should
   be used instead.

   From a traditional ISP and corporations perspective, there is no
   additional benefit in using PPPoE technology, if compared to IEEE
   802.1X: the major concerns of using PPPoE are the PPP frame overhead
   and the MTU limitation.  However, one aspect must be considered when
   deploying IEEE 802.1X: current implementations are based on EAP-TLS
   [5].  Although EAP-TLS is the perfect choice for corporations that
   already deployed X.509 certificates, it is not for ISPs, mobile
   operators and corporations that do not own, or plan to have, an X.509
   infrastructure. Creating and maintaining a PKI infrastructure is
   expensive, especially if a public Certification Authority is used,
   and requires expert human resources dedicated to the PKI.  Moreover,
   non 802.1X compliant Access Points should be replaced.

   Another advantage of embracing PPPoE for Network Access Provider
   (NAP) or Network Service Provider (NSP) is that they can provide
   secure access to a corporate gateway, by using Layer 3 routing, Layer



G. Paterno'                   Experimental                      [Page 7]

   2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP), and/or IPSec tunnels in a similar way of
   existing dial-up scenarios (modem, ISDN, ADSL, etc..).  This makes
   the business model of selling wholesale services and Virtual Private
   Dial-up Networks (VPDNs) scalable.

   For consumers, small businesses, and local ISPs the PPPoE MTU
   limitation is not an issue, if compared to the cost of deploying both
   hardware and EAPOL compliant software to the client.  The advantage
   of using PPPoE is that the user is uniquely identified, by preserving
   the existing access points and with a simple additional component
   (the PPPoE server).  As a result, corporate and ISPs are able to
   protect their resources by adding a PPPoE server: this approach is
   easier to deploy if compared to EAPOL with EAP-TLS, that requires a
   more complex infrastructure and management.  It has to be considered
   that most of today's operating systems include a PPPoE client,
   resulting in a low cost deployment for this technology because no
   additional software is required.

   Finally, Access Point manufacturers can easily embed a PPPoE server
   in their products and provide an easy configuration, e.g. through a
   web interface. To provide the new service to APs already deployed,
   the PPPoE server might be distributed as a firmware update.

   It has been mentioned in the former paragraphs that the use of PPPoE
   has an Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) issue: as specified in [1],
   the Maximum Receive Unit (MRU) option must not be negotiated to a
   size larger than 1492; Ethernet has a maximum payload size of 1500
   octets. The PPPoE header is 6 octets and the PPP protocol ID is 2
   octets, so that the PPP MTU must not be greater than 1492.  However,
   based on the author's experience, some misbehaved VPN software
   packages add their own overhead to the MTU reported by the PPPoE
   interface, making the network packets too large to pass through a PPP
   over Ethernet connection: reducing the MTU by 32 bytes, i.e. reducing
   it to 1460, should generally suffice.

3.3. The encryption layer

   A Wireless LAN, being "over-the-air", might be considered a public
   switched network, in a similar way of the telephone network. For
   example, in the traditional Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS), a
   malicious user intercept PPP packets by tapping the phone wire. The
   Wireless LAN can be managed therefore as a dial-up connection, so
   that encryption and/or access policies should be applied, e.g.
   protecting the access through a firewall or a proxy, allowing only
   specific applications.  As a result, it is recommended that users
   that need privacy should add an encryption layer on top of their
   connection, be a wireless LAN or a standard PPP over modem.

Internet-Draft  Using PPPoE to authenticate Wireless LANs   January 2003


   The ideal choice for encrypting wireless traffic is taking advantage
   of a PPP extension, named Encryption Control Protocol (ECP) [18],
   which configures and enables data encryption on both ends of the
   point-to-point link.  ECP uses the same packet exchange mechanism as
   the Link Control Protocol (LCP) and, more in general, provides a
   framework for negotiating and applying parameters associated with
   encryption, e.g. choosing the algorithm.  At present, two algorithms
   has been defined, i.e. DESE-bis [19] and 3DESE [20], but the author
   is not aware of any implementation of ECP nor any associated option,
   making it difficult to immediately deploy the solution.

   However, a PPP Compression Control Protocol (CCP) [22] option, named
   Microsoft Point-To-Point Encryption Protocol [6], implements
   encryption, other than compression: Microsoft, in fact, created MPPE
   to apply security to its Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)
   [8].  MPPE is an optional PPP extension that is negotiated within
   option 18 [16] in the Compression Control Protocol, and uses the
   Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) RC4 [17] algorithm to provide data
   confidentiality.  It was originally designed for encryption across a
   point-to-point link where packets arrive in the same order in which
   they were sent with little packet loss.  MPPE can use 40-bit, 56-bit,
   or 128-bit encryption keys: the 40-bit key provides backward
   compatibility with old clients.

   The MPPE protocol itself is already available and it has been
   deployed in several devices and dial-in products: MPPE therefore
   could be a simple, but efficient solution for companies, ISPs and
   mobile operators who wish to implement secure wireless access.

   As ECP is not yet available, some specific customers (e.g. finance
   and government) might require higher-grade encryption than the one
   provided by MPPE.  An easy solution is the adoption of an application
   layer encryption technique, e.g.  through SSL, to be added on top of
   the MPPE PPP-layer encryption.  Other suggested solutions are the
   adoption of IPSec [7], the de-facto standard Point-to-Point Tunneling
   Protocol (PPTP) [8], or other encryption technologies.

4. An architecture example

   In the previous chapter, the Wireless LAN has been compared to a
   dial-up infrastructure from a security perspective. Using this
   similarity, a typical corporate scenario can be analysed as an
   example.

      |                   +------------------+  +---------------+
   +----------+
   | Intranet |
   +----------+


   It has been mentioned that remote access systems, such as modems, are
   subject to "wardialing", i.e. the attempt of a malicious user of
   guessing the modem telephone number and accessing the corporate
   network: this is the reason why most of IT security policies do not
   allow to connect a modem and an analogue phone line to internally
   connected computers.

   Although, in a corporate security policy, dial-up users are usually



G. Paterno'                   Experimental                     [Page 10]

Internet-Draft  Using PPPoE to authenticate Wireless LANs   January 2003


   considered more "trusted" than global Internet users, they are
   however subject to an IP-based inspection (e.g. using firewalls or
   access lists) to limit access to corporate resources.

   In the example above, dial-up users are placed between two firewalls,
   in a zone named DMZ2. The front-end (FE) border firewall separates
   global Internet access from externally visible services (DMZ1), which
   contains for example DNS and Mail, and remote access users (DMZ2).
   DMZ2 is considered more secure than DMZ1: this zone is suitable for
   dial-up (be a RAS server or outsourcing through a Virtual Private
   Dial-up Network) and Wireless LAN user: both accesses requires the
   user to supply credentials to gain access to IP-based network.  In
   particular, wireless users are subject to PPPoE access verification
   and encryption (MPPE) through the PPPoE Access Concentrator (i.e. the
   PPPoE server)

   Once a dial-up/wireless user has obtained access, a back-end (BE)
   firewall connects the DMZ2 to another security zone (DMZ3) and the
   corporate Intranet. DMZ3 hosts a RADIUS server to authenticate users,
   an internal proxy and a VPN concentrator, which implements encrypted
   tunnels for users connecting from the Internet

   In a highly-secure environment, the security policies might only
   allow a encrypted data flow, e.g. through SSL, from wireless users in
   DMZ2 to the Intranet (HTTPS, IMAPS, etc...).  For specific
   unencrypted applications, e.g. TN3270E mainframe access, the policies
   might require a VPN secure tunnel to be established prior to access
   the service.

5. Conclusions

   At the time of writing, it is extremely easy from a malicious users
   perspective to gain access to wireless networks, even if encrypted.
   Many Wireless LANs are unencrypted and their access points are
   configured to release dynamic IP address through the Dynamic Host
   Configuration Protocol. In such a configuration, it is even easier
   for an intruder to gain access to the network. Moreover, this raises
   some legal concerns: in some countries it is not illegal to gain
   access to a network that is not protected in any way or limited
   through a warning statement, for example through the usual
   "restricted area" banner, because the user is not accessing the
   Wireless LAN by "forcing" the system.

   Public services, such as mobile operators, ISPs, and free wireless
   networks, will not take advantage of any evolution of the WEP
   protocol. Today the encryption keys are unique for the whole Wireless
   LAN segment, which means that keys should be made publically
   available, in turn making the WEP protection mechanism ineffective.

   For consumers and corporations, using WEP or future protocols to
   encrypt "over-the-air" transmission is still an advantage: although
   easy to decrypt, the intruder should be very motivated to enter the
   network because an observation of thousands of interesting packets is
   needed to gain access to the encryption keys.

   Through this paper the author analyses the advantages of using Point-
   To-Point over Ethernet protocol as a solution for a Wireless LAN
   authentication layer: it has been demonstrated that, through the
   reuse of existing elements of the network and without changing the
   existing infrastructure, consumers, corporations and Internet Service
   Providers can take advantage of PPPoE, resulting in a more secure
   environment with no or little additional cost.
