Internet-Draft             Atom Export Format                   May 2009


1.  Introduction

   [[anchor2: This section is yet to be written.]]


2.  Conformance Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Atom Export Documents

   An Atom Export Document is an Atom Feed Document [RFC4287].

   atom:entry elements are given purpose within the document by an atom:
   category element whose the scheme attribute is equal to "XXX-to-be-
   decided" and whose term attribute matches one of the below:

   1.  "post" signifies the entry represents a blog post.  Furthermore,
       an atom:category with scheme
       "http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" and term
       "http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post" SHOULD be
       treated as equivalent.

   2.  "comment" signifies the entry represents a reply to a post which
       MUST be in the same Atom Export Document and which MUST be
       specified by an thr:in-reply-to element [RFC4685] within the
       entry.  Furthermore, an atom:category with scheme
       "http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind" and term
       "http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment" SHOULD be
       treated as equivalent.

   Such an atom:category element MUST be the first element child of the
   atom:entry.  If it is not, implementations MUST NOT incur any meaning
   from it.

   Any atom:entry which does not have such an atom:category element is
   assigned absolutely no meaning by this specification.


4.  Further Recommendations

   This section is informative.

   If an implementation wishes to store data beyond what is easily
   representable within Atom for importing/exporting state, it is

   recommended that a namespace is created to contain this extra
   metadata, and it is not coerced in an over-engineered manner into
   Atom.


5.  Security Considerations

   As Atom Export Documents are just Atom Feed Documents, please see the
   "Security Considerations" section of [RFC4287].

   Furthermore, as they can contain extensions from [RFC4685], please
   see that document too.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA considerations.
