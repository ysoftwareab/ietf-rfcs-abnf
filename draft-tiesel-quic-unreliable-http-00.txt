1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", and
   "MAY" are used in this document.  It's not shouting; when these words
   are capitalized, they have a special meaning as defined in [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   HTTP has become part of application protocols used for time sensitive
   applications such as video streaming and back-office ad auctions.
   These applications might have time constraints that can make
   retransmissions of lost frames useless.  Some of these applications
   can operate on partially delivered messages, but waiting for
   retransmissions blocks the delivery of data after a gap in the stream
   by design.

   This draft enables applications to request partial delivery of HTTP
   objects by allowing to disable retransmissions for HTTP response
   bodies.

3.  General Concept

   This draft specifies a new HTTP header for requesting unreliable
   delivery of the HTTP request body.  For answering requests including
   this header, the server uses unreliable QUIC streams as specified in
   [I-D.tiesel-quic-unreliable-streams] to transfer HTTP request bodies
   in a (partially) unreliable way.  To use the regular HTTP client
   logic, headers are always transferred reliably.

4.  Requesting Unreliable transmission

   By adding the following header, an HTTP client can request unreliable
   transmission of the response body

   Transport-Response-Reliability: unreliable

   In case unreliable transmission should only be used to prevent
   retransmissions after a certain deadline, the client hat add the
   following header

   Transport-Response-Reliability: unreliable-after DATE

   Where DATE is either a relative offset in milliseconds or a date as
   specified in [RFC7231] with optionally extending time-of-day to

   time-of-day = hour ":" minute ":" second
               | hour ":" minute ":" second "." msec

   In case of having requested unreliable delivery with the "unreliable-
   after" verb, retransmissions on that stream should be stopped after
   the time specified.

   For unreliable deliver with using the "unreliable" verb, the server
   may use domain knowledge about the data transmitted to decide whether
   to retransmit parts of the data.

5.  Stream Mapping

   The stream mapping scheme changes between versions -04 and -05 of
   [I-D.ietf-quic-http].  While version -04 separates HTTP header and
   body into different QUIC streams, version -05 transports multiple
   HTTP/2 frames of different types within one stream.  We present
   different stream mapping for these versions.

   Note that draft-ietf-quic-http-04 allows a simpler implementation as
   it does not require partial retransmission within an unreliable
   stream.

5.1.  Stream Mapping for draft-ietf-quic-http-04

   The control stream MUST alway use a reliable stream to ease state
   keeping.

   When indicated by the "Transport-Response-Reliability" HTTP header,
   the server SHOULD open the data stream as unreliable stream.

5.2.  Stream Mapping for draft-ietf-quic-http-05

   As a prerequisite to requesting unreliable delivery of HTTP objects,
   the client MUST open a stream used for the request as an unreliable
   stream.  The "Transport-Response-Reliability" HTTP header sent over
   reliable streams SHOULD be ignored.

   Despite opening the stream as an unreliable stream, all HTTP/QUIC
   frame headers, as well as the payload of "HEADERS" frames, MUST be
   transmitted reliably to re-use normal HTTP/2 application logic.
