Internet-Draft    DNSCurve: Link-Level Security for DNS    February 2010


1.  Introduction

   DNSCurve adds link-level security to the Domain Name System (DNS).
   It includes a key distribution mechanism compatible with today's name
   server software and registry services, and two packet formats: a
   simple streamlined format requiring minimal space and processing
   overhead and a mostly backwards-compatible format intended for use
   with strict firewalls and DNS proxies.

   DNSCurve packets include a cryptographic MAC (aka authenticator) to
   provide integrity and availability.  Clients can be confident that
   verified responses came from the appropriate server and were not
   forged by a blind or even sniffing attacker, while servers can be
   confident that responses will not be replayed against other
   unintended clients.  Additionally, DNSCurve packets are encrypted to
   provide some confidentiality.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Overview

   DNSCurve uses Curve25519XSalsa20Poly1305, a particular combination of
   the Curve25519, Salsa20, and Poly1305 primitives as described in
   [naclcrypto].  In particular, it is a cryptosystem featuring 256-bit
   public and secret keys, 192-bit nonces, and 128-bit authenticators.

   Each DNSCurve client and server has a secret key and a corresponding
   public key.  DNSCurve servers distribute their public keys by
   encoding them in name server names embedded in standard DNS NS
   records (as described in Section 4), while DNSCurve clients
   distribute their public keys by including them in their query
   packets.  (Additional mechanisms for key distribution like DNSSEC's
   trust anchors and DLV are possible, but not defined by this
   document.)

   When a DNSCurve client is about to send a DNS query to a name server,
   if the client knows a DNSCurve public key for that name server, it
   MAY instead use that public key along with its own DNSCurve secret
   key and a nonce to protect its query in a "cryptographic box" as
   described in [naclcrypto].  The client then encodes this
   cryptographic box along with the nonce and its own public key as an
   expanded DNSCurve query packet, which it sends to the DNSCurve server
   instead of the original DNS query.

Internet-Draft    DNSCurve: Link-Level Security for DNS    February 2010


   Upon receiving a DNS query packet, a DNSCurve name server should
   first treat the packet as a DNSCurve query packet by extracting the
   client's DNSCurve public key, nonce, and boxed query and trying to
   open the box using the extracted public key and its own secret key.
   However, if this fails (i.e., the packet is not formatted as an
   expanded DNSCurve query packet or the box's authenticator is
   invalid), then the server responds to the packet as a normal DNS
   packet.

   Assuming the unboxing succeeds, then the server discovers the
   client's original query packet.  To send a response, the server
   chooses a nonce extension to append to the client-chosen nonce, and
   protects its response packet in a cryptographic box using the extend
   nonce and same keys used to unbox the client's DNS query.  The server
   then encodes this cryptographic box as an expanded DNSCurve response
   packet, which it sends to the DNSCurve client instead of the original
   DNS response.

   Meanwhile, the DNSCurve client waits for an expanded DNSCurve
   response packet.  If it receives a non-DNSCurve response packet, an
   expanded DNSCurve response packet with an invalid nonce (i.e., not an
   extension of its original nonce) or an invalid cryptographic box
   (i.e., cannot be opened using the same keys and the extended nonce),
   then it discards the packet and continues waiting.  Once it receives
   a valid expanded DNSCurve response packet, it opens the cryptographic
   box to discover the server's original DNS response.


3.  Base-32 Encoding

   Sometimes DNSCurve communicates arbitrary byte strings inside domain
   names.  While the DNS protocol is 8-bit safe for names and labels
   (except for case-insensitive handling of ASCII alphabetic
   characters), many tools have trouble with arbitrary characters in
   domain names, in particular domain registrar software.  To cope with
   this limitation, DNSCurve encodes byte strings using a set of safe
   alphanumeric characters.

   In DNSCurve's base-32 encoding, a byte string is interpreted as a
   number in little-endian form.  Each 5-bit sequence of this number,
   from least significant to most significant, is encoded as one of the
   standard "digits" "0123456789bcdfghjklmnpqrstuvwxyz".  A final
   sequence of fewer than 5 bits is zero-extended before encoding.
   Decoders MUST accept "BCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ" as synonyms for
   "bcdfghjklmnpqrstuvwxyz".

   For example, the two-byte string with bytes {0x64,0x88} (i.e.,
   {100,136} decimal) is interpreted as the integer 0x8864 (i.e.,



Dempsky                  Expires August 30, 2010                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft    DNSCurve: Link-Level Security for DNS    February 2010


   34916).  The bits 1000100001100100 of this integer are divided into
   5-bit parts 00100, 00011, 00010, 00001, which in turn are encoded as
   "4", "3", "2", "1".  The original string is therefore encoded as the
   string "4321".

   N.B., this is not the same encoding as defined in [RFC4648].  In
   particular, the byte string is chunked into 5-bit sequences
   differently, and a different alphabet is used.  The first allows
   DNSCurve public keys to be encoded slightly more compactly (see
   Section 4), and the second helps to further prevent false positives
   when searching for base-32 encoded strings in domain names.

3.1.  Examples

     +-------------------------------------------+------------------+
     | Byte string                               | Base-32 encoding |
     +-------------------------------------------+------------------+
     | {}                                        | ""               |
     | {0x88}                                    | "84"             |
     | {0x9f,0x0b}                               | "zw20"           |
     | {0x17,0xa3,0xd4}                          | "rs89f"          |
     | {0x2a,0xa9,0x13,0x7e}                     | "b9b71z1"        |
     | {0x7e,0x69,0xa3,0xef,0xac}                | "ycu6urmp"       |

     | {0x72,0x3c,0xef,0x3a,0x43,0x2c,0x8f}      | "l3hygxd8dt31"   |
     | {0x17,0xf7,0x35,0x09,0x41,0xe4,0xdc,0x01} | "rsxcm44847r30"  |
     +-------------------------------------------+------------------+


4.  Encoding Public Keys in Name Server Names

   DNSCurve public keys are encoded in name server names as a 54-byte
   label consisting of the magic string "uz5" followed by the first 51
   bytes of the base-32 encoding of the public key.  (Curve25519 public
   keys are actually 255-bit integers in little-endian, so the 52nd byte
   of the base-32 encoding will always be "0".)

   When a DNSCurve client is searching a name server name for a DNSCurve
   public key, it MUST check every label for an encoded public key.  If
   multiple public keys are found, the left-most label MUST be chosen.
   String comparison with "uz5" MUST be performed case-insensitively.


5.  Nonce Generation

   For every request, DNSCurve clients generate a 96-bit nonce, and for
   every response, DNSCurve servers generate a 96-bit nonce extension.
   Nonces MUST be unique for distinct packets for the same client-server



Dempsky                  Expires August 30, 2010                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft    DNSCurve: Link-Level Security for DNS    February 2010


   key pair.  A simple way to achieve this is to choose a unique nonce
   for each packet and for each retransmission.  Additionally, servers
   MUST use a non-zero nonce extension (because nonces are zero extended
   in query packets).  However, subject to these constraints, clients
   and servers may generate nonces however they choose.

   Two recommended ways to generate a 96-bit nonce or nonce extension
   are

   1.  a 64-bit counter (starting at 1) followed by a 32-bit random
       number and

   2.  a 64-bit timestamp (e.g., nanoseconds since 1970) followed by a
       32-bit random number.

   In either case the 64-bit value MUST NOT decrease even if the
   software restarts or the system clock jumps backwards.

   If multiple clients or multiple servers share a DNSCurve secret key,
   then they MUST make sure no two separate clients or servers generate
   the same nonce.  A simple way to achieve this is to use nonce
   separation; e.g., if two servers share a DNSCurve key pair, one
   server could use only even nonces and the other could use only odd
   nonces.


6.  DNSCurve Expanded Formats

   DNSCurve defines two expanded formats: "streamlined" and "TXT".  Each
   includes a format for expanded queries and a format for expanded
   responses.  DNSCurve clients may send DNSCurve expanded queries using
   whichever format it chooses, but they are encouraged to use the
   streamlined format when possible.  A DNSCurve server MUST support
   DNSCurve expanded queries in either format and MUST send expanded
   responses using the corresponding format.

6.1.  Streamlined Format

   An expanded query packet in streamlined format has the following
   bytes:

   o  8 bytes: the magic string "Q6fnvWj8".

   o  32 bytes: the client's DNSCurve public key.

   o  12 bytes: a client-selected nonce for this packet.

Internet-Draft    DNSCurve: Link-Level Security for DNS    February 2010


   o  A cryptographic box containing the original DNS query packet.

   An expanded response packet in streamlined format has the following
   bytes:

   o  8 bytes: the magic string "R6fnvWJ8".

   o  12 bytes: the client's nonce.

   o  12 bytes: a server-selected nonce extension.

   o  A cryptographic box containing the original DNS response packet.

   Note that this streamlined response format does not repeat the
   client's query name, and in particular does not repeat the client's
   public key.  However, it does repeat the client's nonce.

6.2.  TXT Format

   The "TXT" format receives its name from the fact that expanded query
   and response packets in this format appear to casual inspection to be
   standard DNS packets with two possible exceptions: 1) the query name
   may exceed 255 bytes and 2) the total packet may exceed 512 bytes.

   When encoding an expanded query packet in TXT format, a DNSCurve
   client MUST create a DNS standard query packet with the AA, TC, RD,
   RA, Z, and RCODE bits cleared, a single entry in the question
   section, and no records in the answer, authority, or additional
   records sections.  The one question MUST ask for Internet-class TXT
   records for the query name constructed from the concatenation of the
   following labels:

   o  One or more labels, each label except the last being exactly 50
      bytes, with the last label being at most 50 bytes.  The
      concatenation of these labels is the base-32 encoding of a 96-bit
      client-selected nonce for this packet followed by a cryptographic
      box containing the original DNS query packet.

   o  One 54-byte label: the client's DNSCurve public key, encoded as
      described in Section 4, except with the magic string "x1a" instead
      of "uz5".

   o  Zero or more additional labels specifying the name of the zone
      served by this server; i.e., the owner name of the relevant NS
      record.

   A DNSCurve server SHOULD be lenient in decoding expanded query
   packets in TXT format.  In particular, it MUST allow the RD bit to



Dempsky                  Expires August 30, 2010                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    DNSCurve: Link-Level Security for DNS    February 2010


   either be set or clear, MUST allow records in the answer, authority
   records, and additional records sections, and MUST allow any labels
   to follow the DNSCurve public key in the query name.  However, it
   MUST discard packets with the QR bit set.

   When encoding an expanded response packet in TXT format, a DNSCurve
   server MUST create a DNS standard response packet copying the ID, RD
   bit, and questions section from the expanded query packet, setting
   the AA bit, leaving the TC and RA bits cleared and Z and RCODE values
   set to 0, containing one record in the answer section, and no records
   in the authority records or additional records section.  The record
   in the answer section MUST be an Internet-class TXT record for the
   query name from the questions section with a TTL of 0.  The RDATA of
   this record is the 96-bit server-selected nonce extension followed by
   a cryptographic box containing the original DNS response packet,
   encoded as a sequence of one or more strings of at most 255 bytes in
   standard DNS TXT RDATA format.

   Similarly, a DNSCurve client SHOULD be lenient in decoding expanded
   response packets in TXT format.  In particular, it MUST allow the
   server to alter the case of the query name when repeating it in the
   questions section.


7.  UDP and TCP

   If a normal DNS response packet is larger than 512 bytes then the
   server replaces it by an explicitly truncated packet.  The client
   then tries again through TCP.  Servers are not required to support
   TCP if no responses are above 512 bytes; clients are permitted to try
   TCP only if the server has explicitly indicated truncation.

   DNSCurve does not require TCP support from servers that were not
   already supporting TCP.  If the original DNS response packet is at
   most 512 bytes then the server is permitted to send the expanded
   response packet as a UDP packet.  DNSCurve clients are required to
   set aside a 4096-byte buffer for receiving a UDP response packet.

   If the original DNS response packet is larger than 512 bytes then it
   is replaced by an explicitly truncated packet and the truncated
   packet is protected by DNSCurve.  In this case the client tries again
   by TCP, sending its DNSCurve query packet through TCP and receiving
   the DNSCurve response through TCP.

   TCP is considerably more expensive for clients and servers than UDP
   is, and TCP has no protection against denial of service, so server
   administrators are advised to stay below 512 bytes if possible.
   DNSCurve adds some denial-of-service protection for UDP but cannot do



Dempsky                  Expires August 30, 2010                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft    DNSCurve: Link-Level Security for DNS    February 2010


   anything to help TCP.

   If a protected DNS query includes an EDNS0 OPT record, then the
   payload size field refers to how large the original DNS response
   packet can be before encoding as a DNSCurve response packet.  Clients
   MUST reduce the payload size they advertise to account for overhead
   from encoding the response as an expanded response packet.  If a
   server builds a response within the payload size limit, but then
   cannot fit the encoded response in 4096 bytes, it MAY silently
   discard the response.

   Even when DNSCurve transactions take place over UDP, they may still
   be vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks due to spoofed IP
   fragments if response packets are large enough to require IP
   fragmentation.  Therefore, servers SHOULD try to keep response
   packets within the path's MTU limits.


8.  Security Considerations

   The security of the Curve25519XSalsa20Poly1305 cryptosystem and its
   underlying cryptographic primitives is discussed in [naclcrypto].  In
   summary, it is designed to meet the standard notions of privacy and
   third-party unforgeability for a public-key authenticated-encryption
   scheme using nonces.

   DNSCurve only provides link-level security between a client-server
   pair.  It does not attempt to ensure end-to-end security for queries
   and responses relayed by untrusted DNS proxies and caches.

   DNSCurve clients are free to choose whether or not to use DNSCurve on
   a per query basis; e.g., a client may decide to fallback to standard
   DNS after a few failed DNSCurve queries.  Of course, DNSCurve cannot
   make any security guarantees for transactions that do not use
   DNSCurve, so clients are encouraged to use DNSCurve if possible.

   DNSCurve adds some confidentiality by encrypting DNS packet contents
   but does not attempt to hide the length of the original DNS packet
   nor the source or destination of the packet.  Additionally, the TXT
   format requires clients to reveal the zone they are querying.


9.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
