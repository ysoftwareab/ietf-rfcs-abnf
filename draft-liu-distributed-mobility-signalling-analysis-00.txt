Internet-Draft           DMM Signalling Analysis              March 2011


1.  Introduction

   When the core network gateways are deployed near to the access
   network for distributed purpose, the number of gateways will be
   increased in the same coverage area.  Hence the user movement may
   lead to signalling cost caused by gateways relocation.  This document
   analyzes the mobility management protocols of 3GPP 3G/LTE networks to
   present the detail effects of signalling cost in the case of
   distributed gateways.  This signalling analysis includes two parts of
   mobility handling, one is the mobility management based on network,
   and the other is mobility management based on client.


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Network based mobility management

3.1.  Signalling overhead

   SGSN and GGSN are user plane gateways in 3GPP 3G network.  SGSN also
   contains the functions of control plane, so it is not applicable to
   be distributed.  Only the case of distributed GGSN is considered
   here.  If the anchor GGSN is not changed, there is no difference
   compared to current centralized deployment even the GGSN is
   distributed.  The signalling procedure is involved by user equipment
   because radio condition changes.  If there is no change to radio
   access network deployment even the GGSN is distributed, both the
   radio signalling messages and core network signalling messages will
   not be increased.

   S-GW and P-GW are user plane gateways in 3GPP LTE network.  P-GW is
   the anchor gateway and S-GW is the access gateway.  The anchor
   gateway can not be changed when the user is moving, but the access
   gateway will be relocated from one to another.  So the core network
   signalling cost is mainly increased by S-GW relocation.  There is no
   radio signalling cost as 3G system described above.  Table 1
   indicates the detail signalling cost of different mobility management
   procedures.

3.2.  Conclusion

   Impact to the radio interface:There is no extra signalling cost on
   radio interface when the gateways are distributed and the number of
   the gateways is increased.

   Impact to the core network:The gateway relocation will increase
   signalling cost, but the influence could be minimal.  The possibility
   of gateways relocation will be increased when the gateways are
   distributed and the number of the gateways is increased.  Hence the
   cost of extra signalling is little, and the influence on the core
   network equipment can be ignored.


4.  Client based mobility management

4.1.  Signalling overhead analysis

   This section takes DSMIPv6 as an example to analyze the signalling
   effects to client based mobility management due to distributed
   deployment of gateways.  When the intra non-3GPP handover with
   DSMIPv6 procedures are initiated as defined in 3GPP specification, on
   the assumption of no change to the radio infrastructures (e.g. based
   stations) deployment, distributing non-3GPP access gateways should
   not increase the total frequentness of handover when the client

   moves, but should increase the rate of the handover of crossing the
   non-3GPP access gateway (normally the authenticator of the client
   access authentication).  The relocation of non-3GPP access gateway of
   the client would cause the local IP address re-allocation, and
   trigger the client re-authentication as well as DSMIPv6 binding
   update procedures.  These procedures would increase the signalling
   messages to both radio access network and core network.

4.2.  Conclusion

   Air interface overhead: In the case of inter gateway handover, the
   signalling messages for radio access network are increased with the
   gateways distributed, and the exact number of signalling messages is
   related to the wireless technologies of the radio access network.

   Core network overhead: In the case of inter gateway handover, the re-
   authentication and other update procedures should introduce more
   signalling messages than those of intra gateways handover; With
   number increase, the distributing gateways will make the inter
   gateway handover procedure happen more frequently.  Hence it causes
   large cost of sigalling to the core network.


5.  Conclusion

   When the gateways are distributed, the frequentness of gateway

   relocation will increase.  It relates to the specific model of
   distributed gateways.  For the mobility management based on network,
   there is no extra signalling cost to radio acces network and a few
   effects on core network in the procedure of gateway relocation.  In a
   word, the extra signalling cost can be ignored when the gateways are
   distributed.

   For the mobility management based on client, there is some cost on
   both radio and core network signalling when the procedure of gateway
   relocation is initiated due to the handling of some procedures,such
   as re-authentication and IP address allocation. however the
   signalling cost may be reduced by some new optimization mechanisms.
