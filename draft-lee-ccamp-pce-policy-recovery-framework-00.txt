2.  Motivation

   Recovery mechanism in telecommunication networks has been simplistic
   as the scope of recovery has been segmented into a specific layer or
   a particular switching capability.  Typically different organizations
   are responsible for the protection/restoration of the specific layer
   and/or the switching capability.  As vertical and horizontal
   integration is promised in the emerging GMPLS network, it is evident
   that the complexity of recovery mechanism has increased.  The
   complexity of the recovery mechanism in the GMPLS integrated network
   has many dimensions that include technical complexity as well as
   organizational complexity.  This complexity arises partly due to
   diversity of views and practices inherent to the individual
   organizations/networks that comprise of GMPLS network integration
   [OKI], [MLN-RQMT].

   Therefore, it is important that operators of the GMPLS networks
   should be given the capability to choose recovery policies that best
   fit to the practices and philosophies of the operators.  To
   accommodate this flexibility and need, it is necessary to define
   recovery policy model.  While implementation and enforcement of
   policy is largely a local matter, it is important to provide
   operators with the capability to choose preferred recovery policy for
   their recovery operation.

   This document provides a set of recovery policies.  This document
   also provides a high level framework for recovery policy architecture
   and the protocol requirements.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Recovery Policy Definition

   This section provides policy definition for recovery.  In order to
   discuss recovery policy constraints, it is essential to understand
   the scope of specific protection and restoration mechanism currently
   defined by the GMPLS CCAMP Working Group.  Based on the discussions
   in RFC 4426, 4427, 3471 and [RECOVERY], there are two types of
   protection/restoration have been defined: (i) Span (Link) Protection
   and (ii) End-to-End (Path) Protection and Restoration.  Under Span
   (Link) Protection, the following protection types have been defined:

   - Unprotected (0:1)

   - (Full) Re-routing

   - Re-routing without Extra Traffic

   - Unidirectional 1+1 dedicated protection

   - Bi-directional 1+1 dedicated protection

   - Dedicated 1:1 protection with extra traffic

   - Shared M:N protection

   Under End-to-End (Path) protection and restoration, the following
   mechanisms have been defined:

   - Unidirectional 1+1 Protection

   - Bi-directional 1+1 Protection

   - Dedicated 1:1 Protection

   - Unprotected

   - Extra Traffic

   Given the aforementioned Protection/Restoration schemes, there are
   numbers of criteria in which operator's recovery policy can be
   defined.  The recovery policy constraints specified below can be
   applied per protection type or globally applied to all protection
   types.  The list specified below is not meant to be extensive or
   complete.  Some of these policies are mono-layer oriented while
   others are multi-layer oriented.  As more recovery related policies
   are identified, the list will be expanded.

   - Computation of the Protection Path/Link: (i) the protection path



Lee & Zhu               Expires December 1, 2006                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft       Policy-based Recovery in GMPLS             May 2006


   can be computed before the failure (pre-computed) or (ii) the
   protection path is computed after the failure (post-computed).

   - Selection of the Protection Path/Link: (i) the selection of the
   protection path is pre-selected before the failure (pre-selected) or
   (ii) the selection of the protection path is selected after the
   failure (post-selected).

   - Signaling of the Protection Path/Link: (i) the protection path
   setup is signaled before the failure (pre-signaled) or (ii) the
   protection path setup is signaled after the failure (post-signaled).

   - Allocation of Bandwidth on the Protection Path/Link: (i) pre-
   allocated (the protection bandwidth is pre-allocated and therefore
   reserved prior to the failure of the protected path; or (ii) post-
   allocated (the protection bandwidth is allocated after the failure of
   the protected path).

   - Composition of the Protection Path/Link: (i) only single-layer
   path/link is allowed; or (ii) multi-layer path/link is allowed.

   - Protection Reversion: (i) allowed (the switching of the user
   traffic from the protecting to the protected path after recovery is
   allowed); or (ii) disallowed (the switching of the user traffic from
   the protection to the protected path after recovery is not allowed).

   We can easily see that there is a place for policy-based recovery
   mechanism that would allow operators to choose appropriate policies
   depending on the operator's need and integration directives.  It is
   to be noted that these policy-based capability provides flexibility
   to the operators and facilitates operator's horizontal and vertical
   integration effort.  Given the complexities and varieties of the
   service protection and the network conditions, the operators should
   be given an ability to flexibly adapt and enforce their preferences.

4.  Recovery Policy Architecture

   This section provides recovery policy architecture and its key
   components.  As seen in the previous section, some of the recovery
   policies defined in the previous section are closely related to the
   path computation element (PCE).  Recovery policy architecture,
   therefore, can be built on top of the existing PCE architecture as
   defined in [PCE ARCH].  On the other hand, it should be also possible
   to build recovery policy architecture that has a direct interface
   with the Signaling Engine.  This approach is based on a distributed
   philosophy.

   Presented in this section, therefore, are the two base architecture:
   (i) Recovery Policy Architecture in the context of the PCE (ii)
   Recovery Policy Architecture with a direct interface with he
   Signaling Engine.

4.1.  Recovery Policy Architecture in the context of the PCE

   Figure 1 depicts that recovery policy decision is conveyed to the PCE
   by which enforcement of the recovery policy is to be performed.  As
   recovery and path computation are closed related, the recovery policy
   can be viewed as an additional component to the PCE with this
   architecture.

   The invocation of the recovery policy is typically independent of the
   service request or signaling flow.  When operator's recovery policy
   is communicated to the Recovery Policy Decision Point (R-PDP), the
   R-PDP, then, communicates the recovery policy to the PCE.  There are
   many ways for the R-PDP to communicate the recovery policy to the
   PCE.  The choice of the protocol between the R-PDP and the PCE is not
   the focus of this draft.  Whether the R-PDP is local to the PCE or
   external is also beyond the scope of this draft.

   With respect to the R-PDP, the PCE depicted in Figure 1 serves as the
   Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) as defined in [RFC 2748] and
   [Bryskin].  The responsibility of the PCE is to disseminate the
   recovery policy information to the nodes that need to implement
   recovery policy during the path establishment stage.  There may be
   several options for the PCE to disseminate the recovery policy
   information to the nodes during the path etablishment stage.  One
   obvious way is through the Signaling Protocol.  This requires the PCE
   to request to the Signaling Engine to include the recovery policy
   Object/TLV during path establishment.  This particular method will be
   discussed in more detail in section 4.2.  With the PCE architecture
   where the PCE is an external entity from the LSR, the PCE could
   establish a direct interface to each node under its domain control
   and disseminate the recovery policy information via the PCE-PCC
   protocol.

   The PCE is also responsible for enforcing the recovery policy in its
   path computation process.  It is to be noted that some of the
   recovery policy may be enforced at the PCE level while others may be
   enforced at the Signaling Engine.  For instance, if recovery policy
   for bandwidth allocation were 'allocation before failure' on the
   protection path, then this policy should be applied in the process of
   reservation.  The enforcement of this policy would be expected at the
   Signaling Engine.  On the other hand, recovery policy related to
   computation (for instance, whether the protection path is computed
   before the failure or not) would be enforced by the PCE as such
   function is an integral part of the PCE.

   Important aspect is that both the PCE and the Signaling Engine share
   the same policy and coordinate each other in the enforcement of the
   recovery policy.  While the recovery policy information is to be
   disseminated from the PCE to the Signaling Engine with this
   architecture, the Signaling Engine should communicate the level of

Internet-Draft       Policy-based Recovery in GMPLS             May 2006


   protection associated with a service request to the PCE.  When the
   Signaling Engine requests path computation to the PCE, the recovery
   level (protection/restoration) should be communicated to the PCE so
   that the PCE would be able to enforce the recovery policy associated
   with the recovery level.

   For example, let's suppose that the Signaling Engine requests path
   computation for 1:1 protection for a given source-destination pair.
   The PCE inspects if there are any policy constraints for 1:1
   protection.  Let say the recovery policies for the protection path
   are: pre-computed, pre-signaled, pre-selected, pre-allocated, inter-
   layer path allowed, protection reversion allowed.  Then the path
   computation would proceed subject to these policy constraints where
   possible.

   In order for the policy realized across the network domain, the
   recovery policy information should be communicated between the PCE
   and the Signaling Engine via the PCE-PCC protocol [PCEP], and/or
   between the PCEs.  Proper Object/TLV should be defined in both PCE-
   PCC Protocol and/or the PCE-PCE Protocol to achieve policy
   realization and dissemination across the network domain.

4.2.  Recovery Policy Architecture with a Direct Interface with the
      Signaling Engine

   Figure 2 shows recovery policy architecture that has a direct
   communication interface with the Signaling Engine.

   Figure 2: Recovery Policy Architecture with a direct communication
   interface with the Signaling Engine.

   This architectural option does not depend on the PCE architecture as
   heavily as the previous option.  While the PCE component is still
   needed in order to enforce recovery policy, the role of the PCE is
   secondary as compared to the previous architecture option.  The
   Recovery-Policy Decision Point (R-PDP) conveys the recovery policy
   information directly to the Signaling Engine.  The Signaling Engine
   is the main policy enforcement point (PEP) with this model.  The
   Signaling Engine is responsible for the dissemination of the recovery
   policy information to the PCE as well as to adjacent nodes.

   Upon a service request, the Signaling Engine would request path
   computation to the PCE via the PCE-PCC protocol.  In doing so, the
   recovery policy information should be conveyed from the Signaling
   Engine to the PCE as part of the request message so that the PCE
   would apply relevant recovery policy in path computation.

   As the recovery policy information resides at the Signaling Engine,
   the dissemination of the recovery policy is to be performed by the
   Signaling Engine to adjacent nodes associated with the path during
   the path establishment stage.  The Signaling Engine at the headend
   node, upon a service request, would request path computation to the
   PCE.  The PCE would then apply the pertinent recovery policy
   associated with the path request and proceed with the path
   computation.  The PCE then would send the reply message back to the
   Signaling Engine with the result.  As the Signaling Engine proceed
   with the signaling to the nodes along the path, the recovery policy
   information is to be sent to downstream nodes.

   The recovery policy information is then stored in the Signaling
   Engine in each and every downstream node on the both the protection
   and protected paths.  The recovery policy information can be defined
   as an object/TLV of the RSVP-TE signaling.  Compared to the previous
   architecture, the role of the Signaling Engine is more significant.
   The dissemination of the recovery policy information is based on
   distributed and as-needed basis through the Signaling Protocol.  When
   a path is set up, the recovery policy information should be
   communicated to all the nodes associated with the path such that
   recovery policy would be enforced if necessary at each node along the
   path.  To illustrate, let's consider the following topology.

   Figure 3: An Example topology.

   Let say that the path (A-B-C-D-E) is the protected path whereas the
   path (B-F-G-D) is the protection path for the segment (B-C-D) of the
   path (A-B-C-D-E).  Assume that the operator wants to enforce the
   following recovery policy: pre-computed protection path, pre-selected
   protection path, pre-signaled protection path, pre-allocated
   bandwidth, multi-layer protection allowed, reversion not allowed.  As
   the Path message is signaled to downstream nodes along the path (A-B-
   C-D-E), the recovery policy information is included as an object/TLV
   in the PATH message so that each node is updated with the recovery
   policy sent by the headend node A. As the RESV message is sent back
   from node E, node B would initiate the path set up for the protection
   path enforcing the recovery policy it previously received.  All the
   relevant recovery policy would be applied where possible by node B.
   According to the recovery policy, node B would request computation
   and selection of the protection path to the PCE.

   Notice that since the policy allows multi-layer links for its
   protection path, node B should communicate this policy to the PCE so
   that the PCE would apply this particular policy in its path
   compuation process.  Upon the receipt of the reply message sent from
   the PCE, node B would then proceed the signaling of the path to the
   adjacent node F while allocating bandwidth for the path according to
   the policy.

   Assume that a link failure takes place on link (C-D).  Based on the
   protection scheme, traffic on the protected path would be rerouted to
   the protection path (A-B-F-G-D-E).  After the failure is fixed, based
   on the recovery policy, traffic will not be reverted back to the
   protected path.

   This example illustrates why the recovery policy object/TLV should be
   disseminated to the nodes that are part of the recovery.  It also
   shows how the recovery policy information is used in the nodes along

5.  Communication Protocol Requirements

   This section discusses communication protocol requirements to support
   the recovery policy architecture presented in the previous section.

   There are four key communication interfaces whereby communication
   protocol support is required to support recovery policy architecture
   defined in the previous section.

   - Communication between the Recovery Policy Decision Point (R-PDP)
   and the Signaling Engine

   - Communication between the Recovery Policy Decision Point (R-PDP)
   and the PCE

   - Communication between the PCE and the Signaling Engine

   - Communication between the Signaling Engines (i.e., between nodes)

   Communications between the R-PDP and the Signaling Engine and between
   the R-PDP and the PCE can be the Common Open Policy Service (COPS)
   protocol [RFC 2748], although not limited to that.

   Communication between the PCE and the Signaling Engine can be done
   via the Path Computation Element communication Protocol (PCEP) which
   is described in [PCEP].  The notification message is intended to
   notify useful information between the PCE and the Path Computation
   Client (PCC) according to [PCEP].  Recovery related policy
   information should to be defined as an Object/TLV compliant to the
   PCEP message format.

   RSVP-TE Object/TLV should be defined to be able to disseminate
   recovery policy information to other nodes along the path during the
   path establishment stage.  When recovery policy information is
   reached to other nodes, this would invoke an update to the existing
   policy if any.  The recovery policy information would be also used to
   enforce any local decision associated with protection/restoration.

6.  Recovery Policy Object/TLV Definition

   This section provides the definition for the Recovery Policy (RP)
   Object/TLV.  The format of the RP Object is as follows:


           0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |P|C|S|G|B|L|R|               Reserved              | Link Flags|
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |P|C|S|G|B|L|R|               Reserved              | Path Flags|
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   - Protected (P): 1 bit

   When set to 1, it indicates that the Path/Link is a protected path/
   link.  When set to 0 (default), this bit indicates that the Path/Link
   is a protection path/link.

   - Computation (C): 1 bit

   When set to 1, this bit indicates that the protection path/link is
   computed after failure.  When set to 0 (default), this bit indicates
   that the protection path/link is computed before failure.

   - Selection (S): 1 bit

   When set to 1, this bit indicates that the protection path/link is
   selected after failure.  When set to 0 (default), this bit indicates
   that protection path/link is selected before failure.

   - Signaling (G): 1 bit

   When set to 1, this bit indicates that the protection path/link setup
   is signaled after failure.  When set to 0 (default), this bit
   indicates that protection path/link setup is signaled before failure.

   - Bandwidth (B): 1 bit

   When set to 1, this bit indicates that the protection bandwidth is
   allocated after failure of the protected path/link.  When set to 0,
   this bit indicates that the protection bandwidth allocation is pre-
   allocated prior to failure of the protected path/link.

   - Layer (L): 1 bit

   When set to 1, this bit indicates that multi-layer path/link is
   allowed for the path/link.  When set to 0 (default), this indicates
   that multi-layer path/link is not allowed for the path/link.

   - Reversion (R): 1 bit

   When set to 1, this bit indicates that the switching of the user
   traffic from the protection to the protected path/link after recovery
   is allowed.  When set to 0 (default), this indicates that protection
   reversion is not allowed.

   - Reserved: 19 bits

   - Link Flags: 6 bits

   This indicates the desired link protection type (per [RFC 3471]).
   Currently, the following link protection types have been defined in
   [RFC 3471]: Enhanced, Dedicated 1+1, Dedicated 1:1, Shared,
   Unprotected, Extra Traffic.

   - Path Flag: 6 bits

   This indicates the desired path recovery type.  Currently, the
   following path recovery types have been defined in [RECOVERY]:
   Unprotected, Re-routing, Re-routing without extra traffic, 1:N
   Protection with Extra Traffic, 1+1 Unidirectional Protection, 1+1 Bi-
   directional Protection.

   The format defined above would allow recovery policy constraints for
   both the protection path/link and the protected path/link by the P
   bit.  It allows recovery policy constraints to be defined per
   recovery type and is expandable to accommodate variety of recovery
   types and their recovery policies.

7.  Areas for Standardization

   The following areas require standardization in order to support
   policy recovery mechanism discussed in this draft.

   - Definition of the recovery policy and the MIB

   - The Recovery Policy Object/TLV structure

   - PCEP Protocol modifications to adopt the Recovery Policy Object/TLV

   - RSVP-TE Extension modifications to adopt the Recovery Policy
   Object/TLV
