4.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        RFC 1155 [RFC1155], RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215 [RFC1215].
        The second version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 2578
        [RFC2578], RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second version of the SNMP
        message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901]
        and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the message
        protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906],
        RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second set of protocol
        operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
        [RFC1905].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
        in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

Internet Draft               RMON Framework             November 1, 2002


5.  Definition of RMON

Remote network monitoring devices, often called monitors or probes, are
instruments that exist for the purpose of managing a network.  Often
these remote probes are stand-alone devices and devote significant
internal resources for the sole purpose of managing a network.  An
organization may employ many of these devices, one per network segment,
to manage its internet.  In addition, these devices may be used for a
network management service provider to access a client network, often
geographically remote.

When the RMON standard was young, this device-oriented definition of
RMON was taken quite literally, as RMON devices were probes purpose-
built and dedicated to running the RMON MIBs. Soon, cards were
introduced that added RMON capability into a network hub, switch or
router. RMON also began to appear as a software capability that was
added to the software of certain network equipment, as well as software
applications that could run on servers or clients. Despite the variety
of these approaches, the RMON capability in each serves as a dedicated
network management resource available for activities ranging from long-
term data collection and analysis or for ad-hoc firefighting.

In the beginning, most, but not all, of RMON's capabilities were based
on the promiscuous capture of packets on a network segment or segments.
Over time, that mixture included more and more capabilities that didn't
depend on promiscuous packet capture. Today, some of the newest
standards added to the RMON framework allow multiple techniques of data
gathering, where promiscuous packet capture is just one of several
implementation options.


6.  Goals of RMON

    o Offline Operation
        There are sometimes conditions when a management
        station will not be in constant contact with its
        remote monitoring devices.  This is sometimes by
        design in an attempt to lower communications costs
        (especially when communicating over a WAN or
        dialup link), or by accident as network failures
        affect the communications between the management
        station and the probe.

        For this reason, this MIB allows a probe to be
        configured to perform diagnostics and to collect

Internet Draft               RMON Framework             November 1, 2002


        statistics continuously, even when communication with
        the management station may not be possible or
        efficient.  The probe may then attempt to notify
        the management station when an exceptional condition
        occurs.  Thus, even in circumstances where
        communication between management station and probe is
        not continuous, fault, performance, and configuration
        information may be continuously accumulated and
        communicated to the management station conveniently
        and efficiently.

    o Proactive Monitoring
        Given the resources available on the monitor, it
        is potentially helpful for it continuously to run
        diagnostics and to log network performance.  The
        monitor is always available at the onset of any
        failure.  It can notify the management station of the
        failure and can store historical statistical
        information about the failure.  This historical
        information can be played back by the management
        station in an attempt to perform further diagnosis
        into the cause of the problem.

    o Problem Detection and Reporting
        The monitor can be configured to recognize
        conditions, most notably error conditions, and
        continuously to check for them.  When one of these
        conditions occurs, the event may be logged, and
        management stations may be notified in a number of
        ways.

    o Value Added Data
        Because a remote monitoring device represents a
        network resource dedicated exclusively to network
        management functions, and because it is located
        directly on the monitored portion of the network, the
        remote network monitoring device has the opportunity
        to add significant value to the data it collects.
        For instance, by highlighting those hosts on the
        network that generate the most traffic or errors, the
        probe can give the management station precisely the
        information it needs to solve a class of problems.

    o Multiple Managers
        An organization may have multiple management stations

Internet Draft               RMON Framework             November 1, 2002


        for different units of the organization, for different
        functions (e.g. engineering and operations), and in an
        attempt to provide disaster recovery.  Because
        environments with multiple management stations are
        common, the remote network monitoring device has to
        deal with more than own management station,
        potentially using its resources concurrently.

7.  RMON Standards

The RMON Framework includes a number of standards. Each standard that
makes up the RMON framework defines some new useful behavior (i.e. an
application) and managed objects that configure, control and montitor
that behavior. This section lists those standards and described the role
of each.

Figure 1 shows how many of the components of the RMON framework relate
to one another.

7.1.  RMON-1

The RMON-1 standard is focused at layer 2 and provides link-layer
statistics aggregated in a variety of ways. In addition, it provides

Internet Draft               RMON Framework             November 1, 2002


generation of alarms when thresholds are crossed as well as the ability
to filter and capture packet contents. The components of RMON-1 are:

  The Ethernet Statistics Group

      The ethernet statistics group contains statistics measured by the
      probe for each monitored Ethernet interface on this device.

  The History Control Group

      The history control group controls the periodic statistical
      sampling of data from various types of networks.

  The Ethernet History Group

      The ethernet history group records periodic statistical samples
      from an ethernet network and stores them for later retrieval.

  The Alarm Group

      The alarm group periodically takes statistical samples from
      variables in the probe and compares them to previously configured
      thresholds.  If the monitored variable crosses a threshold, an
      event is generated.  A hysteresis mechanism is implemented to
      limit the generation of alarms.

  The Host Group

      The host group contains statistics associated with each host
      discovered on the network.  This group discovers hosts on the
      network by keeping a list of source and destination MAC Addresses
      seen in good packets promiscuously received from the network.

  The HostTopN Group

      The hostTopN group is used to prepare reports that describe the
      hosts that top a list ordered by one of their statistics.  The
      available statistics are samples of one of their base statistics
      over an interval specified by the management station.  Thus, these
      statistics are rate based.  The management station also selects
      how many such hosts are reported.

  The Matrix Group

      The matrix group stores statistics for conversations between sets

Internet Draft               RMON Framework             November 1, 2002


      of two addresses.  As the device detects a new conversation, it
      creates a new entry in its tables.

  The Filter Group

      The filter group allows packets to be matched by a filter
      equation.  These matched packets form a data stream that may be
      captured or may generate events.

  The Packet Capture Group

      The Packet Capture group allows packets to be captured after they
      flow through a channel.

  The Event Group

      The event group controls the generation and notification of events
      from this device.


7.2.  Token Ring Extensions to RMON MIB

Some of the functions defined in the RMON-1 MIB were defined specific to
Ethernet media. In order to operate the functions on Token Ring Media,
new objects needed to be defined in the Token Ring Extensions to RMON
MIB. In addition, this MIB defines additional objects that provide
monitoring functions unique to Token Ring.

The components of the Token Ring Extensions to RMON MIB are:

  The Token Ring Statistics Groups

      The Token Ring statistics groups contain current utilization and
      error statistics.  The statistics are broken down into two groups,
      the Token Ring Mac-Layer Statistics Group and the Token Ring
      Promiscuous Statistics Group.  The Token Ring Mac-Layer Statistics
      Group collects information from Mac Layer, including error reports
      for the ring and ring utilization of the Mac Layer.  The Token
      Ring Promiscuous Statistics Group collects utilization statistics
      from data packets collected promiscuously.

  The Token Ring History Groups

      The Token Ring History Groups contain historical utilization and
      error statistics.  The statistics are broken down into two groups,

Internet Draft               RMON Framework             November 1, 2002


      the Token Ring Mac-Layer History Group and the Token Ring
      Promiscuous History Group.  The Token Ring Mac-Layer History Group
      collects information from Mac Layer, including error reports for
      the ring and ring utilization of the Mac Layer.  The Token Ring
      Promiscuous History Group collects utilization statistics from
      data packets collected promiscuously.

  The Token Ring Ring Station Group

      The Token Ring Ring Station Group contains statistics and status
      information associated with each Token Ring station on the local
      ring.  In addition, this group provides status information for
      each ring being monitored.

  The Token Ring Ring Station Order Group

      The Token Ring Ring Station Order Group provides the order of the
      stations on monitored rings.

  The Token Ring Ring Station Config Group

      The Token Ring Ring Station Config Group manages token ring
      stations through active means.  Any station on a monitored ring
      may be removed or have configuration information downloaded from
      it.

  The Token Ring Source Routing Group

      The Token Ring Source Routing Group contains utilization
      statistics derived from source routing information optionally
      present in token ring packets.


7.3.  The RMON-2 MIB

The RMON-2 MIB extends the architecture defined in RMON-1 primarily by
extending RMON analysis up to the application layer.

The components of the RMON-2 MIB are:

  The Protocol Directory Group

      Every RMON 2 implementation will have the capability to parse
      certain types of packets and identify their protocol type at
      multiple levels, The protocol directory presents an inventory of

Internet Draft               RMON Framework             November 1, 2002


      those protocol types the probe is capable of monitoring, and
      allows the addition, deletion, and configuration of protocol types
      in this list.

  Protocol Distribution Group

      This function controls collection of packet and octet counts for
      any or all of the protocols detected on a given interface.  An NMS
      can use this table to quickly determine bandwidth allocation
      utilized by different protocols.

  Address Mapping Group

      This function lists MAC address to network address bindings
      discovered by the probe and what interface they were last seen on.

  Network Layer Host Group

      This function counts the amount of traffic sent from and to each
      network address discovered by the probe.

  Network Layer Matrix Group

      This function counts the amount of traffic sent between each pair
      of network addresses discovered by the probe.

  Application Layer Host Group

      This function counts the amount of traffic, by protocol, sent from
      and to each network address discovered by the probe.

  Application Layer Matrix

      This function counts the amount of traffic, by protocol, sent
      between each pair of network addresses discovered by the probe.

  User History

      This function allows an NMS to request that certain variables on
      the probe be periodically polled and for a time-series to be
      stored of the polled values.

  Probe Configuration

      This group contains configuration objects that configure many

      aspects of the probe including the software downloaded to the
      probe, the out of band serial connection and the network
      connection.


7.4.  RMON MIB Protocol Identifiers

The RMON-2 MIB identifies protocols at any layer of the 7 layer
hierarchy with an identifier called a Protocol Identifier, or ProtocolID
for short.. ProtocolIDs also identify the particular configuration of
layering in use including any arbitrary encapsulations. The RMON MIB
Protocol Identifiers document is a companion document to the RMON-2 MIB
that defines a number of well-known protocols.

As the RMON Framwork has grown, other standards have been added to the
framework that utilize ProtocolIDs.


7.5.  Remote Network Monitoring MIB Extensions for Switched Networks

Switches have become pervasive in today's networks as a form of
broadcast media. SMON provides RMON-like functions for the monitoring of
switched networks.

Switches today differ from standard shared media protocols because:

   1)   Data is not, in general, broadcast.  This MAY be caused by the
        switch architecture  or by the connection-oriented nature of the
        data. This means, therefore, that monitoring non-broadcast
        traffic needs to be considered.

   2)   Monitoring the multiple entry and exit points from a switching
        device requires a vast amount of resources - memory and CPU, and
        aggregation of the data in logical packets of information,
        determined by the application needs.

   3)   Switching incorporates logical segmentation such as Virtual LANs
        (VLANs).

   4)   Switching incorporates packet prioritization.

   5)   Data across the switch fabric can be in the form of cells. Like
        RMON, SMON is only concerned with the monitoring of packets.

Differences such as these make monitoring difficult. The SMON MIB

Internet Draft               RMON Framework             November 1, 2002


provides the following functions that help to manage switched networks:

  smonVlanStats

      This function provides traffic statistics per Virtual LAN for
      802.1q VLANs.

  smonPrioStats

      This function provides traffic statistics per priority level for
      802.1q VLANS.

  dataSourceCaps

      This function identifies all supported data sources on an SMON
      device. An NMS MAY use this table to discover the RMON and Copy
      Port attributes of each data source.

  portCopyConfig

      Many network switches provide the capability to make a copy of
      traffic seen on one port and send it out another port for
      management purposes.  This occurs in addition to any copying
      performed during the normal forwarding behavior of the switch.

      The portCopyConfig function provides control of the port copy
      functionality in a device.


7.6.  RMON MIB Extensions for Interface Parameters Monitoring

Many network switches contain hundreds of ports, many with only one
attached device. A common operation when managing such a switch is to
sort the interfaces by one of the parameters (e.g. to the find the most
highly utilized interface). If the switch contains many interfaces it
can be expensive and time consuming to download information for all
interfaces to sort it on the NMS. Instead, the ifTopN MIB allows the
sorting to occur on the switch and for only the top interfaces to be
downloaded.


7.7.  RMON Extensions for Differentiated Services (DSMON MIB)

This MIB defines extensions of RMON for monitoring the traffic usage of
Differentiated Services [RFC2474] codepoint values. The 6-bit DiffServ

codepoint portion (DSCP) of the Type of Service (TOS) octet in the IP
header provides for 64 different packet treatments for the
implementation of differentiated network devices. DSMON-capable RMON
probes collect and aggregate statistics based on the inspection of the
DSCP value in monitored packets.

The DSMON MIB defines a DSCP counter aggregation mechanism to reduce the
total number of counters by configuring the agent to internally
aggregate counters based on the DSCP value. This mechanism is designed
to overcome the agent data collection limitation, performs data
reduction at the agent and applications level, and optimizes the
application for cases when some codepoint values are not used, or lead
to similar packet treatment in the monitored network domain.

The components of the DSMON MIB are:

  The Aggregate Control Group

      The aggregate Control Group enables the configuration of the
      counter aggregation groups.

  The DSMON Statistics Group

      The DSMON Statistics Group contains per counter aggregation group
      distribution statistics for a particular RMON data source.

  The DSMON Protocol Distribution Group

      The DSMON Protocol Distribution Group reports per counter
      aggregation distribution statistics for each application protocol
      detected on a particular RMON data source.

  The DSMON Host Group

      The DSMON Host Group contains host address distribution statistics
      for each counter aggregation group, detected on a particular RMON
      data source.

  The DSMON Capabilities Group

      The DSMON Capabilities Group reports the DSMON MIB functional
      capabilities of the agent implementation.

  The DSMON Matrix Group

7.8.  RMON for High Capacity Networks

This MIB defines extensions to RMON for use on high capacity networks.
Except for the mediaIndependentTable, each of the tables in this MIB
adds high capacity capability to an associated table in the RMON-1 MIB
or RMON-2 MIB.

The mediaIndependentTable provides media independent utilization and
error statistics for full-duplex and half-duplex media. Prior to the
existence of the HCRMON MIB, a new table needed to be created for RMON
monitoring of each data-link layer media. These tables included many
statistical attributes of the media including packet and octet counters
that are independent of the media type. This wasn't optimal because
there was no way to monitor media types for which a media-specific table
had not been defined. Further, there were no common objects to monitor
media-independent attributes between media types.

In the future, for media other than ethernet and token ring, the
mediaIndependentTable will be the source for media-independent
statistics. Additional media-specific tables may be created to provide
attributes unique to particular media such as error counters.

The HC-RMON MIB contains a number of groups that each extend a group in
the original RMON-1 and RMON-2 MIBs. In addition, the
mediaIndependentGroup contains objects that allow media independent
monitoring.


7.9.  Application Performance Measurement MIB

The APM MIB provides analysis of application performance as experienced
by end-users.

Application performance measurement measures the quality of service
delivered to end-users by applications. With this perspective, a true
end-to-end view of the IT infrastructure results, combining the
performance of the application, desktop, network, and server, as well as
any positive or negative interactions between these components.

Internet Draft               RMON Framework             November 1, 2002


Despite all the technically sophisticated ways in which networking and
system resources can be measured, human end-users perceive only two
things about an application: availability and responsiveness.

   Availability - The percentage of the time that the application is
   ready to give a user service.

   Responsiveness - The speed at which the application delivers the
   requested service.

The APM MIB includes the following functions:

  The APM Application Directory Group

      The APM Application Directory group contains configuration objects
      for every application or application verb monitored on this
      system.

  The APM User Defined Applications Group

      The APM User Defined Applications Group contains objects that
      allow for the tracking of applications or application verbs that
      aren't registered in the protocolDirectoryTable.

  The APM Report Group

      The APM Report Group is used to prepare regular reports that
      aggregate application performance by flow, by client, by server,
      or by application.

  The APM Transaction Group

      The APM Transaction Group is used to show transactions that are
      currently in progress and ones that have ended recently, along
      with their responsiveness metric.

      Because many transactions last a very short time, they will exist
      in this table for a very short time. Thus, polling this table is
      not an effective mechanism for retrieving all transactions.

      This table is designed to allow a management station to check on
      the status of long-lived transactions. Because the apmReport and
      apmException mechanisms act only on transactions that have
      finished, a network manager may not have visibility for some time
      into the performance of long-lived transactions such as streaming

      applications, large data transfers, or (very) poorly performing
      transactions. In fact, by their very definition, the apmReport and
      apmException mechanisms only provide visibility into a problem
      after nothing can be done about it. The apmTransactionTable
      provides visibility into transactions that are currently executing
      and will allow a management station to find status of long-lived
      transactions.

  The APM Exception Group

      The APM Exception Group is used to generate immediate
      notifications of transactions that cross certain thresholds. The
      apmExceptionTable is used to configure which thresholds are to be
      checked for which types of transactions. The
      apmTransactionResponsivenessAlarm notification is sent when a
      transaction occurs with a responsiveness that crosses a threshold.
      The apmTransactionUnsuccessfulAlarm notification is sent when a
      transaction fails for which exception checking was configured.

  The APM Notification Group

      The APM Notification Group contains 2 notifications that are sent
      when thresholds in the APM Exception Table are exceeded.


7.10.  RMON MIB Protocol Identifier Reference Extensions

The protocol identifier defined in RMON2 [RFC2021] can identify any
protocol at any layer and its encapsulation. The protocol identifier
macro document [RFC2896] defines a convenient human readable and machine
parseable format for documenting well-known protocols.

For the most part the protocol identifiers used by RMON2 implementations
have described protocols at any layer including the application layer
but haven't gone any deeper into the application. In order to
differentiate an application's behavior while performing different tasks
(logging in vs. downloading, for example) it is important to have a
separate protocol identifier for each application "verb". The macro
defined in [RFC2896] is inconvenient for defining application verbs
because it assumes that most protocols are identified by an integer type
field and many or most applications use other means for identifying
verbs, including character strings.

These extensions define another macro for defining application verbs
that are children of an application. The parent application can be

defined with the original protocol identifier macro and the application
verbs are defined with the new macro.


7.11.  Transport Performance Metrics MIB

The TPM MIB monitors selectable performance metrics and statistics
derived from the monitoring of network packets and sub-application level
transactions.  The metrics are defined through reference to existing
IETF, ITU and other standards organizations' documents.  The monitoring
covers both passive and active traffic generation sources.

The TPM MIB includes the following functions:

  The tpmCapabilities Group

      The tpmCapabilitiesGroup contains objects and tables which show
      the measurement protocol and metric capabilities of the agent.

  The tpmAggregateReports Group

      The tpmAggregateReportsGroup is used to provide the collection of
      aggregated statistical measurements for the configured report
      intervals.

  The tpmCurrentReports Group

      The tpmCurrentReportsGroup is used to provide the collection of
      uncompleted measurements for the current configured report for
      those transactions caught in progress. A history of these
      transactions is also maintained once the current transaction has
      completed.

  The tpmExceptionReports Group

      The tpmExceptionReportsGroup is used to link immediate
      notifications of transactions that exceed certain thresholds
      defined in the apmExceptionGroup [APM]. This group reports the
      aggregated sub-application measurements for those applications
      exceeding thresholds.

7.12.  Synthetic Sources for Performance Monitoring MIB

The Synthetic Sources for Performance Monitoring MIB [SSPM] covers the
artificial generation of a) application-level, b) transport-level, and
c) link-level traffic for the purpose of monitoring system performance.
There are situations where it is useful to be able to control the
generation of synthetic traffic when evaluating system performance.
There are other situations where system performance evaluation can rely
upon naturally generated application-level traffic, in which case one
needs only monitor existing traffic and not instrument synthetic
traffic. The SSPM MIB provides the ability to configure and control the
generation of this synthetic traffic.


7.13.  RMON MIB Extensions for High Capacity Alarms

There is a need for a standardized way of providing the same type of
alarm thresholding capabilities for Counter64 objects, as already exists
for Counter32 objects. The RMON-1 alarmTable objects and RMON-1
notification types are specific to 32-bit objects, and cannot be used to
properly monitor Counter64-based objects.  Extensions to these existing
constructs are needed which explicitly support Counter64-based objects.
These extensions are completely independent of the existing RMON-1 alarm
mechanisms.

This MIB contains 3 functions:

  The hcAlarmControlObjects group

      Controls the configuration of alarms for high capacity MIB object
      instances.

  The hcAlarmCapabilities group

      Describes the high capacity alarm capabilities provided by the
      agent.

  The hcAlarmNotifications group

      Provide new rising and falling threshold notifications for high
      capacity objects.

8.  RMON Framework Components

The collection of standards in the RMON Framework are associated by 1. A
common purpose and similar collection methodologies; and, 2. Use of
common infrastrure components

These common infrastructure components are:
    - MediaIndependent Table
    - Protocol Directory
    - appDirectory
    - DataSource
    - Capabilities


8.1.  MediaIndependent Table

While many ata-link media types exist and they each have unique
features, there are many statistics that are common across most media.
For example, counts of packets and octets are interesting for most
media. The media independent table contains the most common such
statistics and forms a super class from which specific interface types
are inherited. This means that the common statistics can be monitored
even for media types that are unknown.

For example, if the mediaindependentTable had existed prior to the
definition of the etherStatsTable, the etherStatsTable could have
ommitted the etherStatsDropEvents, etherStatsOctets, etherStatsPkts.

The Media Independent Table is defined in the High Capacity RMON MIB
[RFC3287].


8.2.  Protocol Directory

   The second of the RMON infrastructure components is the Protocol
   Directory Group defined in the RMON2 MIB [RFC2021].  The main
   objective of RMON2 was to extend the remote network monitoring agents
   capabilities beyond link layer to higher level protocol monitoring.
   This required a means to globally identify individual protocol
   encapsulations.  This capability is provided by the Protocol
   Directory Group and specifically the protocolDirID found in the
   protocolDirTable in the RMON2 MIB.

   The Protocol Directory allows the agent to provide an inventory of
   the protocols that the agent can decode, count, categorize and time.

Internet Draft               RMON Framework             November 1, 2002


   The directory and its objects are designed to allow for the addition,
   deletion and configuration of the protocol encapsulations in the
   directory list.  The Protocol Directory Group consists of the
   protocolDirLastChange object and the protocolDirTable.  The key
   element in the protocolDirTable is the protocolDirID.  The
   protocolDirID is a hierarchically formatted OCTET STRING to globally
   identify individual protocol encapsulations.  A protocol descriptor
   macro has been defined in RFC 2895 [RFC2895] to describe the various
   protocol layers supported in the protocolDirID protocol hierarchy.
   The protocolDirID is defined as a tree built up from successive
   protocol encapsulations.  Each layer is identified by 4 octet sub-
   identifiers constructed from the protocol identifier fields at the
   various layers of the encapsulation.  The number of layers (actually
   the number of octets in the total encapsulation string) in the
   specific encapsulation is identified by a 1 octet count field
   prepending the string of protocol sub-identifiers.

   Associated with each protocol layer in the protocolDirID is a 1 octet
   parameter field.  The collection of these protocol parameters is
   referred to as the protocolDirParameters.  These 1 octet parameters
   identify the agents capability to count fragmented packets correctly
   and to track sessions for port mapped protocols, e.g., TFTP.  A 1
   octet count of the number of octets in the protocolDirParameters is
   prepended to the protocolDirParameters.

   The protocolDirTable index is comprised of the protocolDirID, the
   protocolDirParameters and their associated length fields.  The index
   format is shown in Figure 2.

         SNMP over UDP over IP over Ethernet.



   The set of defined protocol layers currently described is found in
   RFC2896 [RFC2896].  RFC2895 [RFC2895] defines a process for
   suggesting new protocols to add to the currently defined set.  If
   accepted, then RFC2896 would be updated to reflect these additions.
   In fact, RFC2896 is the second version of the defined protocol
   macros, obsoleting RFC2074 [RFC2074].  RFC2895 also defines how to
   handle protocols that do not map into this well defined tree
   hierarchy built up from encapsulation protocol identifiers.  An
   example of such a protocol encapsulation is RTP which is mapped to
   specific UDP ports through a separate signalling mechanism.  These
   are handled by the ianaAssigned protocols, as described in RFC2895.

   The protocolDirTable is defined (and used) in the RMON2 MIB
   [RFC2021], and is being used in other RMONMIB WG MIBs as well as
   other IETF defined MIBs.  Examples include the APM MIB, the TPM MIB
   and the SSPM MIB [KAL2002].

   As mentioned in previous sections, the protocolDirID is recently
   being extended in two ways.  First, work is underway on a new set of
   protocol descriptor macros which extend the protocol encapsulation
   model to application layer verbs [BIE2002].  This extension was
   motivated by the work on the APM MIB [WAL2002] and the TPM MIB
   [DIE2002].  Second, the APM MIB [WAL2002] defines the
   apmAppDirectoryTable which provides a directory of applications that
   the agent can process.  This is discussed further in the following
   section.  Combined, these extensions allow:

      + The APM MIB to define and monitor end-user's view of application
      performance.

      + The TPM MIB to clearly specify the sub-transactions that
      comprise the application it monitors through the
      tpmTransMetricDirTable.

      + The SSPM MIB [KAL2002] to generate synthetic application
      transactions by importing the appLocalIndex from the APM MIB.




8.3.  Application Directory and appLocalIndex

APM, TPM and related applications collect certain types of statistics
for each application or application verb they are decoding. Some
applications and application verbs are defined in the protocol directory
and thus get their own protocolID and a corresponding
protocolDirLocalIndex. Other application verbs are defined more
dynamically by entries in the apmHttpFilterTable or
apmUserDefinedAppTable. These dynamically defined applications don't
have protocolDirID's assigned to them

The APM MIB defines an important index called the appLocalIndex. For all
application monitoring in the APM and TPM MIBs, applications are
identified by integer values of the appLocalIndex. However, there is no
single registry of applications (as there is for protocols) because
there are a few different mechanisms through which an application may be
registered. For each value of appLocalIndex, a corresponding entry will
exist in one of several tables:

   1. The protocolDirTable - Some values of appLocalIndex
      correspond to protocolDirLocalIndex values assigned in the
      protocolDirTable. Each of these correspond to a protocol defined
      by a protocolID.
   2. The apmHttpFilterTable - Some values of appLocalIndex correspond
      to apmHttpFilterAppLocalindex values assigned in the
      apmHttpFilterTable. Each of these correspond to an application
      verb defined as a set of HTTP transactions that match a set of
      filters.
   3. The apmUserDefinedAppTable - Some values of appLocalIndex
      correspond to index values of the apmUserDefinedAppTable. Each
      of them correspond to an application or application verb defined
      in a user-defined way.

Each value of appLocalIndex will only be registered in one of these
tables. In effect, the appLocalIndex number space is the union of these
number spaces, where these tables must work together to avoid assigning
overlapping (duplicate) appLocalIndexes.

Each unique appLocalIndex value is also registered in the

apmAppDirectoryTable where a number of attributes of the application may
be configured.


8.4.  Data Source

Most RMON functions use a DataSource as a pointer to the entity from
which data is to be collected. The DataSource is an object identifier
which identifies one of three types of data sources:

  ifIndex.<I>

      Traditional RMON dataSources. Called 'port-based' for ifType.<I>
      not equal to 'propVirtual(53)'. <I> is the ifIndex value (see
      [22]).

  smonVlanDataSource.<V>

      A dataSource of this form refers to a 'Packet-based VLAN' and is
      called a 'VLAN-based' dataSource. <V> is the VLAN ID as defined by
      the IEEE 802.1Q standard [19]. The value is between 1 and 4094
      inclusive, and it represents an 802.1Q VLAN-ID with global scope
      within a given bridged domain, as defined by [19].

  entPhysicalEntry.<N>

      A dataSource of this form refers to a physical entity within the
      agent and is called an 'entity-based' dataSource. <N> is the value
      of the entPhysicalIndex in the entPhysicalTable (see [18]).



8.5.  Capabilities

Probe Capabilities objects have been introduced in the RMON MIBs with
the goal of helping applications determine the capabilities of the
different probes in the domain. These objects use a BITS syntax (with
the exception of some of the objects in the TPM and SSPM MIBs), and list
in an explicit manner the MIB groups supported by the probe, as well as
functional capabilities of the specific RMON agents. By reading the
values of these objects it is possible for applications to apply the
relevant RMON functions without going through a trial-and-error process
that can result in loss of time and bandwidth in the operational flow.
These objects have the MAX-ACCESS of read-only, which defines their use
as an indication of what is supported by a probe, and not a means to

configure the probe for operational modes. An RMON agent SHOULD initiate
the capabilities objects at agent initialization and SHOULD NOT modify
the objects during operation.

The probeCapabilities object in the RMON2 MIB describes the capabilities
of probes that support RMON, Token-Ring RMON and RMON2.

The smonCapabilities object in the SMON MIB describes the generic
capabilities of probes that support the SMON MIB.

The dataSourceCapsTable in the SMON MIB defines the capabilities of the
SMON data sources on probes that support the RMON MIB.

The interfaceTopNCaps object in the Interface TopN MIB defines the
sorting capabilities supported by an agent that supports the Interface
TopN MIB.

The dsmonCapabilities object in the DSMON MIB provides an indication of
the DSMON groups supported by an agent that supports the DSMON MIB.

The tpmCapabilitiesGroup contains objects and tables, which show the
measurement protocol and metric capabilities of an agent that supports
the TPM MIB.

The sspmCapabilitiesTable indicates whether SSPM configuration of the
corresponding AppLocalIndex is supported by a device supporting the SSPM
MIB.

The hcAlarmCapabilities object provides an indication of the high
capacity alarm capabilities supported by an agent that supports the HC-
Alarm MIB.

Internet Draft               RMON Framework             November 1, 2002


               Figure 4: A performance monitoring system



   It is the responsibility of the network management application to
   coordinate the individual aspects of the performance management
   system.

   Within the APM, TPM, and SSPM set of RMONMIB MIBs:

      + APMMIB [2] is responsible for the aspects of the "Monitoring
      Metrics Control" directly related to the end-user's perceived
      application-level performance.  The APMMIB also handles aspects of
      "Data Reduction Control" and "Reports".  Finally, when TPMMIB
      relies upon the control tables in the APMMIB for its own control,
      then APMMIB is providing some aspects of "Synchronization Control"
      of the reports from these two MIBs.

      + TPMMIB [3] is responsible for the aspects of the "Monitoring
      Metrics Control".  TPMMIB also handles aspects of "Data Reduction
      Control" and "Reports" related to sub-application-level
      transactions.  Synchronization control with APMMIB is provided by
      opting to rely on the APMMIB control tables within the TPMMIB.

      + SSPMMIB [1] is responsible for the "Traffic Generation Control"
      in the event that synthetic traffic is to be monitored.  The
      other, most common, option is to monitor natural, user-generated
      traffic.

   The "Monitor Metrics Control" is essentially hard-coded in the
   APMMIB.  Within the TPMMIB, a metrics table is used to identify the
   metrics monitored within a specific implementation of te TPMMIB.  The
   "Data Reduction Control" is essentially hard-coded within the MIB
   structure of the APMMIB and the TPMMIB.  These MIBs strictly specify
   the statistics to be reported within a set of reports tables.

   Both the TPMMIB and the SSPMMIB rely upon the APMMIB's appLocalIndex
   to specify the application being monitored or generated.  The APMMIB
   provides the end-user view of the application performance, e.g., the
   Whois transaction time.  The TPMMIB, through its
   tpmTransMetricDirTable, identifies a set of sub-application level
   transactions and their metrics which are associated with the
   application.  E.g, an implementation of the TPMMIB could report the
   DNS lookup time, the TCP connect time (to the Whois Server), the
   Whois Req/Resp download time.  The SSPMMIB could be configured to

Internet Draft               RMON Framework             November 1, 2002


   generate synthetically, these Whois transactions.

   The testing model then is to first configure the traffic generation
   instrumentation through the SSPMMIB control function.  This defines
   aspects of the synthetic traffic such as application type, targets,
   etc.  Once the traffic generation is configured, the network
   management application can setup the monitoring instrumentation
   through the APMMIB and TPMMIB.  These control the reporting periods,
   the type of data aggregation, etc.  Once the tests are complete, the
   network management application retrieves the reports from the
   monitoring metrics control MIBs, e.g., APMMIB and TPMMIB.
