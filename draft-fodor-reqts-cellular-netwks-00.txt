ABSTRACT

   We consider access technology agnostic applications that use IP level
   QoS primitives to specify their QoS requirements. In future wireless
   systems (beyond what is often referred to as 3G), where mobile nodes
   may access an IP backbone over diverse access networks, the IP level
   QoS primitives are not only used to specify the requested IP level
   service, but also (through an access specific translation function)
   to help the mobile node's wireless link manager to configure the
   wireless bearer service. In such a scenario, the IP level QoS
   primitives must meet special requirements in order to support the
   spectrum efficient management of the wireless resources.

   In this draft we discuss the main characteristics of wireless access
   networks and derive the requirements on IP level QoS primitives from
   a wireless, and especially from a cellular perspective.

1   Background and Motivation

INTERNET DRAFT      Requirements on QoS mechanisms   Expires Aug 2002
                   over IP based cellular networks


   One of the key objectives in the evolution and standardization of
   future wireless access technologies beyond 3G (such as the IMT-2000)
   systems, is to offer QoS support for a variety of services, including
   IP services, while considering the critical aspect of optimizing
   spectrum efficiency. Applications that make use of such services
   include voice over IP, streaming services over IP and other QoS
   enabled IP applications that access services of a QoS enabled IP
   network over wireless accesses. Such future wireless systems are
   expected to offer services over multiple access technologies in such
   a manner that applications need not be aware of the specific link
   layer(s) that is (are) available at any given time. For instance, a
   device may have a combination of different interfaces such as wired
   and wireless LAN, and a cellular wireless access. From a user
   perspective, it is a key requirement that the one application can
   operate effectively over any of these accesses. For cellular wireless
   accesses, operating effectively includes consideration of spectrum
   efficiency (which affects cost/performance).

   Clearly, such applications need to be able to specify their end-to-
   end QoS requirements in an access agnostic manner. That is, we assume
   that each access system can have its own translation function, that
   takes the IP level QoS parameters as input and generates the access
   specific parameters from those (see also [1] for further details on
   the role of such translation functionality and [2] for a suitable set
   of such IP level parameters). Thus, applications only need to
   communicate their QoS requirements through IP layer primitives (an
   API) rather than through an access specific primitives.

   Using IP level primitives towards diverse accesses necessitates the
   need to investigate the requirements on IP level QoS primitives from
   a wireless and specifically from a cellular perspective. Cellular
   systems are generally characterized by the fact that their wireless
   resources are scarce and costly.

   In an end-to-end path containing one or more wireless accesses, it is
   expected that the wireless links (providing transport over the air
   interface) will be the most critical ones (_bottlenecks_) for QoS
   delivery. Thus, the end-to-end service will be mainly influenced by
   the suitability of the provided wireless link characteristics.

   One of the challenges in the design of QoS services and the
   associated enabling protocols in the multi-access environment is that
   they must be able to be supported effectively by a variety of link
   layers and QoS mechanisms, including those used by wireless access
   networks.

   It is believed that platforms supporting multiple layer 2 (L2)
   interface types will provide generic (non-interface specific) QoS
   primitives to applications. Since IP based QoS primitives are
   expected to be widely available to application developers on some of
   these platforms (e.g. laptops), it is useful to ensure that spectrum
   efficient radio services can be provided for applications requesting

   QoS through such QoS primitives. Spectrum efficiency is a key factor
   in enabling cellular operators to deploy affordable services.

   In this draft we focus on applications/hosts requesting QoS through
   such primitives, and list the requirements on the IP level QoS
   signaling protocol from the perspective of such applications/hosts.

   The draft is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the cellular
   architecture and the main functionalities of the wireless network
   elements. Note that this model is generic in the sense that it can be
   applicable to a variety of wireless technologies. Section 3 builds on
   the discussion of Section 2 and lists these requirements.

2   Wireless Network Architecture and Characteristics

   We consider an architecture where mobile nodes (MN) access an IP
   network via a cellular access network. We naturally assume that the
   IP layer is present in the mobile node such that the user may
   establish an IP connection to other IP endpoints through the wireless
   access and the IP network. In such a network, a typical scenario
   includes the following elements:

   o  The mobile node (MN) is considered to include the physical device
      connecting to the Wireless Access Network (WAN) and the IP level
      resource manager and signaling entity that allows applications to
      request QoS enabled IP bearer services. The IP level resource
      manager in the MN can provide the wireless link (air interface)
      manager with QoS related information through a technology specific
      translator entity. The wireless link provides the transport
      service over the air interface between the MN and the base station
      (which is part of the radio network of Figure 1).

   o  The Wireless Access Network (WAN) that consists of base stations
      (BS), base station controllers BSC, (also referred to as radio
      network controllers, RNC) and possibly other nodes responsible for
      mobility management, location management, etc. The WAN connects to
      the external IP Network (e.g. The Internet) through (a) gateway
      node(s) (WAN GW). It is important to note that the WAN appears to
      the MN as a L2 network; and is designed and optimized for the
      transmission of radio packets.

   The radio packet delivery service (associated with a specific set of
   traffic and QoS characteristics) that is provided by the WAN is often
   referred to as the radio access bearer service (RABS). For instance,
   a streaming RABS may mean a radio packet delivery service provided by
   the WAN that provides bounded delay and limited packet loss ratio.

   Typically, the terminal equipment has the responsibility for
   identifying the radio access bearers that it needs, and how it will
   use them. Thus, it is responsible for initiating the radio bearers
   between the MN and the WAN GW. Since the applications may use access
   technology agnostic QoS primitives (ie the applications do not have a
   direct interface towards the wireless resource manager), the MN must
   make use of the service information signaled at the IP level in
   determining the appropriate radio bearers to establish.

   The WAN provides RAB services in order to support the layer 2
   connection between the MN and the WAN GW. The characteristics of
   these RAB services are dependent on the wireless mechanisms
   (see [1] for a detailed discussion on such mechanisms), and can be
   markedly different from bearer services in traditional wired networks.

   It is clear that different RAB services (in terms of the provided
   delay, bit error rate, etc.) can be provided, resulting in quite
   different characteristics of QoS, service costs and service
   behaviors. A consequence of this flexibility is that sufficient

                   over IP based cellular networks


   detail about the applications' traffic and service requirements must
   be known in order to determine the appropriate parameter settings to
   enable service optimization.

3   QoS Requirements Imposed by the Wireless Link

   The wireless link provides the RAB service for IP packets over the
   air interface. The main characteristics of the wireless link may be
   summarized as follows:

   C1: Its resources (frequency, time slots, power, CDMA code, _wireless
      bandwidth_ etc.) are generally scarce (and therefore expensive).
      Moreover, some of its resources may change in time due to mobility
      or interference from other wireless users.

   C2: It imposes delay on the bits that are transmitted over it. This
      delay is typically orders of magnitude longer than that caused by
      fixed (e.g. optical) transmission links. Part of this delay is
      lower bounded by physical characteristics of radio wave
      propagation and is not possible to control by resource management
      techniques.

   C3: It causes bit-errors typically with orders of magnitude higher
      probability than that caused by fixed (e.g. optical) transmission
      links. It is possible to reduce the bit error probability
      associated with the wireless link to a _reasonably low_ level at
      the expense of consuming more wireless resources (e.g. power).

   Because of these main characteristics, the resources of the wireless
   link in most wireless technologies (and in most cellular systems) are
   carefully managed (as opposed to over-provisioning). More precisely,
   the objective of the wireless link resource management is twofold:

   O1. To provide the required QoS for the entity (e.g. an IP
      application running on a mobile node) that requests the wireless
      transport service over the air interface. In the case of an IP
      application, this transport service means the transport of the
      bits of the IP packets. The quality of this wireless transport
      service is typically characterized by quantifying C2 and C3 above.

   O2. To make as efficient use of the wireless resources as possible
      (because of C1 above).

   In order to meet these two objectives, wireless resource management
   protocols typically manage resources dynamically at a low level in
   the sense that they control the use of the wireless resources at a
   time scale on the order of the radio frames, which can be much
   shorter than the packet length. For instance, if the quality of a
   wireless link degrades because of increasing interference, the
   resource management technique may increase the transmission power
   over the wireless link.


Fodor, Persson, Westberg, Wiorek                              [Page 5]

INTERNET DRAFT      Requirements on QoS mechanisms   Expires Aug 2002
                   over IP based cellular networks


   From these two objectives (O1-O2) it follows that the radio resource
   management requires information about the required QoS and the
   characteristics of the traffic that is transported over the wireless
   link. These two pieces of information are required to exercise
   admission control and to allocate the necessary resources.

   In a scenario, where the wireless link provides the transport service
   for applications running over IP it is a challenging task to provide
   these two pieces of information, because the application may not be
   aware that it runs over a wireless link. Therefore, in such a
   scenario, the QoS and resource reservation mechanisms at the IP layer
   (e.g. resource reservation and/or signaling protocols, and the IP
   level bearer service, such as the set of integrated services) need to
   provide support for the resource management of the wireless link
   (i.e. the R2/R1 layers below IP in Figure 1).

   From this perspective, the basic requirements on an IP level
   signaling protocol and an IP level bearer service include support for
   the following:

   R1: Fine grained QoS and traffic characterization per user IP-flow

      There must be sufficient information available at the IP layer[1],
      (including parameters that characterize the required QoS and the
      actual traffic), which (through the access specific translation
      function) allows the wireless resource management to derive the
      required QoS parameters and obtain as precise information about
      the offered traffic as possible. These bearer parameters need to
      support diverse wireless access technologies. To this end [2]
      proposes an extension of the controlled load integrated service
      that meets this requirement.

   R2: QoS differentiation within a user IP-flow and/or within a user
      IP-packet

      Since the wireless resource management often operates on the bit-
      level, the wireless resource management can improve the provided
      QoS and the resource efficiency if it has knowledge about the
      structure of the IP packet payload. For instance, for some voice
      applications (codecs) some bits in the IP payload may be more
      important for the human ear than other bits, in which case bit-
      specific bit error rate is provided for these different voice
      sample bits within the packet. This technique is often referred to
      as unequal error protection (UEP) [3].

      Another technique that may be used over the wireless link uses
      different drop levels for packets within the same user flow. This
      technique is similar to the unequal error protection but operates
      at the packet level. It can for instance allow a voice application
      (codec) in the mobile node to drop packets before sending over the
      wireless link and thereby to save wireless resources.

                   over IP based cellular networks


   R3: Bi-directional asymmetric communication

      It is expected that the up-link (i.e. from mobile node toward the
      network) and the down-link (i.e. from the network towards the
      mobile node) can be asymmetric in terms of the required resources
      (e.g. allocated bandwidth). In such a case the wireless link must
      be configured accordingly in the respective directions, such that
      the necessary QoS and resource efficiency objectives (O1 and O2
      above) are met in both directions. Therefore, there has to be
      support for asymmetric bearers that allow bi-directional
      communication between two mobile nodes (or between a mobile node
      and a server) over an IP network.

   R4: Local (as opposed to end-to-end) resource reservation

      The cellular network may provide access to a variety of IP
      networks, including the ones that provide best-effort
      differentiated or integrated services. Therefore, in some cases it
      is important that the resource reservation should apply within the
      access network only rather than end-to-end. Therefore, the QoS
      solution should provide support for non end-to-end resource
      reservations.

   R5: Multi-cast

      Multi-casting is an efficient way to save wireless link resources.
      A prime example on this is a scenario where multiple mobile nodes
      access a streaming server. In such a situation the wireless
      gateway node may broadcast the streaming data to the participating
      mobile nodes rather than using dedicated communication channels.
      Multi-casting (as opposed _multi-unicasting_) allows some of the
      wireless link resources to be re-used between the mobile nodes.

      Therefore, there needs to be a way to create and modify multi-cast
      trees of mobile nodes and wireless nodes.

   R6: Local Control

      In a typical wireless scenario where the mobile node (client)
      requires a service from a server (such as in a streaming or WWW
      services), it is the mobile node that is aware of the wireless
      link conditions including the available wireless bandwidth. Also,
      in such scenarios the wireless node is typically the charged party
      for both the up-link and down-link service. Therefore, it is
      important that the wireless node has some mechanism that allows it
      to control the bandwidth of the traffic that is transmitted over
      the wireless link for both directions. This control of the QoS
      service from the local access allows the wireless node to make
      efficient use of the wireless resources, and at the same time to
      control network charges.

                   over IP based cellular networks


   R7: Rate Adaptivity

      Because the resources of the wireless link may fluctuate in time
      (see C1), the utilization of the wireless resources may be
      increased by allowing the mobile (receiver) node to dynamically
      control the sending rate of IP packets. In particular, the
      application running on the mobile node needs to be able to
      increase/decrease the sending rate of the streaming server
      depending on the available wireless bandwidth. This requirement is
      especially important in a situation where the mobile node executes
      a hand-over from a high bit-rate access network to a low bit-rate
      access network, where the available bit-rates may be different by
      several orders of magnitude.

      Therefore, in this sense, there has to be support for adaptivity
      that allows the wireless resource management to make best use of
      the (currently) available wireless resources.

4   Conclusions

   This draft considered applications that use IP level QoS primitives
   to communicate their QoS requests towards diverse access network
   types. These types of scenarios are expected to be important in
   future wireless systems, where users on the move access services of
   an IP backbone network over multiple accesses, including wireless and
   wired ones. A key requirement on such systems is that applications
   should be able to request QoS in an access agnostic manner. This is
   important because the one user application must be able to work over
   different interface types (eg high speed lan, dial-up modem, wireless
   access). Therefore, we have throughout assumed that applications use
   IP level QoS primitives to express their QoS requirements and
   different link layers use a link layer specific translation function
   to derive the access specific QoS parameters.

   We have also argued that in the case of wireless and especially
   cellular accesses, the end-to-end QoS is mainly influenced by the
   appropriate configuration of the wireless link. The wireless link
   configuration determines the resource efficiency and thereby it has a
   direct impact on the cost of the services that are offered by
   cellular operators.

   The set of requirements for an access agnostic IP level QoS
   primitives which shall control the QoS signaling at both the IP and
   access layer which is suitable for a cellular network is thus driven
   by the QoS requirements of the wireless link. These requirements
   include the support for:

   R1: fine granularity QoS parameters per user IP flow
   R2: QoS differentiation within a user flow and within a user packet
   R3: bi-directional asymmetric communication
   R4: local (as opposed to end-to-end) reservations
   R5: multi-casting
