INTERNET-DRAFT                MPLS TC MIB                  November 2002


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a MIB which contains Textual Conventions for
   use in definitions of management information for Multi-Protocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) networks.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [21].

   For an introduction to the concepts of MPLS, see [RFC3031].


2.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC
        1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described
        in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and
        STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of
        the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the
        message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906
        [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of
        protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
        RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
        in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible.  Some machine readable information in SMIv2
   will be converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the
   translation process.  However, this loss of machine readable
   information is not considered to change the semantics of the MIB.

                   uses the VCI or VPI/VCI field to hold the
                   LDP Label.

                   VCI values MUST NOT be in the 0-31 range.
                   The values 0 to 31 are reserved for other uses
                   by the ITU and ATM Forum.  The value
                   of 32 can only be used for the Control VC,
                   although values greater than 32 could be
                   configured for the Control VC.

                   If a value from 0 to 31 is used for a VCI
                   the management entity controlling the LDP
                   subsystem should reject this with an
                   inconsistentValue error.  Also, if

                   which is known by the agent.

                   snmp(2) - The Simple Network Management Protocol was
                   used to configure this object initially.

                   ldp(3 - The Label Distribution Protocol was used to

                   rsvp(4) - The Resource Reservation Protocol was used
                   to configure this object initially.

                   crldp(5) - The Constraint-Based Label Distribution
                   Protocol was used to configure this object
                   initially.

                   policyAgent(6) - A policy agent (perhaps in
                   combination with one of the above protocols) was
                   used to configure this object initially.

                   unknown(7) - the agent cannot discern which
                   component created the object.

                   An object created by the ldp(3), rsvp(4), crldp(5)

INTERNET-DRAFT                MPLS TC MIB                  November 2002


             DESCRIPTION
                  "A unique identifier within an MPLS network that is
                   assigned to each LSP. This is assigned at the head
                   end of the LSP and can be used by all LSRs
                   to identify this LSP.  This value is piggybacked by
                   the signaling protocol when this LSP is signaled
                   within the network. This identifier can then be
                   used at each LSR to identify which labels are being
                   swapped to other labels for this LSP. This object
                   can also be used to disambiguate LSPs that
                   share the same RSVP sessions between the same
                   source and destination.

                   For LSPs established using CR-LDP, the LSPID is
                   composed of the ingress LSR Router ID (or any of
                   its own IPv4 addresses) and a locally unique
                   CR-LSP ID to that LSR. The first two bytes carry
                   the CR-LSPID, and the remaining 4 bytes carry
                   the Router ID. The LSPID is useful in network
                   management, in CR-LSP repair, and in using
                   an already established CR-LSP as a hop in an ER-TLV.

                   For LSPs signaled using RSVP-TE, the LSP ID is
                   defined as a 16-bit (2 byte) identifier used
                   in the SENDER_TEMPLATE and the FILTER_SPEC
                   that can be changed to allow a sender to
                   share resources with itself. The length of this
                   object should only be 2 or 6 bytes. If the length
                   of this octet string is 2 bytes, then it must
                   identify an RSVP-TE LSPID, or it is 6 bytes,

                     MUST be zero.

                     The following is quoted directly from [RFC3032].
                     There are several reserved label values:

                        i. A value of 0 represents the
                           'IPv4 Explicit NULL Label'. This label
                           value is only legal at the bottom of the
                           label stack.  It indicates that the label
                           stack must be popped, and the forwarding
                           of the packet must then be based on the
                           IPv4 header.

                       ii. A value of 1 represents the
                           'Router Alert Label'.  This label value is
                           legal anywhere in the label stack except at
                           the bottom.  When a received packet
                           contains this label value at the top of
                           the label stack, it is delivered to a
                           local software module for processing.
                           The actual forwarding of the packet
                           is determined by the label beneath it
                           in the stack.  However, if the packet is
                           forwarded further, the Router Alert Label
                           should be pushed back onto the label stack
                           before forwarding.  The use of this label
                           is analogous to the use of the
                           'Router Alert Option' in IP packets [5]
                           [Reference to RFC2113]. Since this label
                           cannot occur at the bottom of the stack,
                           it is not associated with a
                           particular network layer protocol.

                      iii. A value of 2 represents the
                           'IPv6 Explicit NULL Label'. This label
                           value is only legal at the bottom of the
                           label stack.  It indicates that the label
                           stack must be popped, and the forwarding
                           of the packet must then be based on the
                           IPv6 header.

                       iv. A value of 3 represents the
                           'Implicit NULL Label'.
                           This is a label that an LSR may assign and
                           distribute, but which never actually
                           appears in the encapsulation.  When an
                           LSR would otherwise replace the label
                           at the top of the stack with a new label,
                           but the new label is 'Implicit NULL',
                           the LSR will pop the stack instead of

                           doing the replacement.  Although
                           this value may never appear in the
                           encapsulation, it needs to be specified in
                           the Label Distribution Protocol, so a value
                           is reserved.

                        v. Values 4-15 are reserved.

                   * The frame relay label can be either 10-bits or
                     23-bits depending on the DLCI field size and the
                     upper 22-bits or upper 9-bits must be zero,
                     respectively.

                   * For an ATM label the lower 16-bits represents the
                     VCI, the next 12-bits represents the VPI and the
                     remaining bits MUST be zero.

                   * The Generalized-MPLS (GMPLS) label contains a
                     value greater than 2^24-1 and used in GMPLS
                     as defined in [CCAMP-ARCH]."

5.  Security Considerations


   This module does not define any management objects. Instead, it
   defines a set of textual conventions which may be used by other MPLS
   MIB modules to define management objects.

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB
   modules that define management objects. Therefore, this document has
   no impact on the security of the Internet.
