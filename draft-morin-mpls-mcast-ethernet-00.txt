Internet-Draft       Multicast MPLS Ethernet MAC DA        November 2008


1.  Introduction

   [RFC5332] already defines how a multicast Ethernet MAC Destination
   Address (DA) is formed when used for a multicast MPLS packets, but
   doesn't say when a multicast Ethernet MAC is to be used as
   destination address.  Moreover, this specification defines only
   implicitly what is a "multicast MPLS packet".

   It seems useful, to ensure proper interoperability when multicast
   MPLS is used on Ethernet interfaces, to provide additional
   clarifications to [RFC5332], on the following points:

   o  when a multicast router should use a multicast Ethernet MAC DA for
      a packet that it sends, and respectively when it should use a
      unicast Ethernet MAC DA

   o  when a router should accept unicast Ethernet MAC DA and multicast
      Ethernet MAC DA

   o  when a packet is considered a "multicast MPLS packet"

   o  the conditions in which the label used to build a multicast
      Ethernet MAC Destination Address is not the second label of the
      frame

   The intent is to propose this document as an update of RFC5332.


2.  Multicast MPLS packet

   [RFC5332] defines a multicast label as being a label "[mapped to an
   NHLFE which] specifies a set of next hops, with the semantics that
   the packet is to be replicated and a copy of the packet sent to each
   of the specified next hops".  We can define an Multicast MPLS packet
   as an MPLS packet for which the topmost label is a multicast label
   (or if the second label is a multicast label if the topmost label is
   a Context Label[RFC5331]).

   Note well that an MPLS packet that result from the encapsulation of a
   multicast MPLS packet is not necessarily a "multicast MPLS packet".
   For instance, when an MPLS multicast packet of a P2MP LSP signalled
   with [RFC4875] or [I-D.ietf-mpls-ldp-p2mp] is encapsulated into a P2P
   backup LSP, the resulting packet is *not* a multicast MPLS packet,
   since the topmost label in the resulting packet is not a multicast
   label.

3.  Choice of Ethernet MAC destination address

   This section is applicable when the data link layer is Ethernet.

   A router MUST use a multicast Ethernet MAC destination address
   (formed in conformance to [RFC5332] ) to send an Ethernet frame
   containing a multicast MPLS packet for which the topmost label is a
   Context Label [RFC5331] and the second label is Upstream assigned.

   A router MUST use a unicast Ethernet MAC DA as the Ethernet MAC
   destination address of a multicast MPLS packet for which the topmost
   label is downstream assigned, to ensure that a multicast MPLS packet
   will be processed only by the LSR that has assigned the label.

   A router MUST be able to process a multicast MPLS packet for which an
   Upstream Assigned Label is used along with a context label, whether
   it carries a unicast or multicast Ethernet MAC destination address.

   Though unicast MPLS is out of the scope of this document, it is noted
   that the use of unicast Ethernet MAC destination addresses is
   expected for unicast MPLS packets (i.e. non-multicast) MPLS packet.
   As explained inSection 2, this would be the case when an multicast
   MPLS packet is encapsulated into a P2P LSP.


4.  MPLS Label used to build a multicast Ethernet MAC destination
    address

   [RFC5332] says that "When an LSR transmits a multicast MPLS packet in
   a multicast Ethernet frame, it MUST set the MAC Destination Address
   to the value 01-00-5e-8v-wx-yz, where [...] vwxyz MAY be set to 0
   [or..]  MAY be set to the value of one of the MPLS labels on the
   packet's label stack."

   There does not seem to be any use case where 'vwxyz' would be set to
   the value of an MPLS label of the stack which is not the topmost
   label or the second label.  Thus, routers MUST use the second label
   of the MPLS stack to built the Ethernet MAC destination address when
   a Context Label is used as the topmost label and the second label is
   an Upstream Assigned label[RFC5331].


5.  IANA Considerations

   his document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.
