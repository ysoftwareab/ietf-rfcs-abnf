1.  Introduction

   Currently, Optical Transport Networks (OTNs) is widely used in the
   transport network.  Some operators already use control-plane
   capabilities based on GMPLS to control optical transport network to
   improve the network management efficiency.

   The GMPLS signalling extensions defined in [RFC4328] provide the
   mechanisms for basic GMPLS control of OTN based on the 2001 revision
   of the G.709 specification.  The 2012 revision of the G.709
   specification, [G709-2012], introduce some new features, and the
   GMPLS control of OTN based on the 2012 revision of the G.709
   specification is covered in [RFC7062], [RFC7096], [RFC7138] and
   [RFC7139].  The 2016 revision of the G.709 specification includes
   some new features, such as OTUCn, ODUCn and OPUCn.  The OTUCn
   contains an optical data unit (ODUCn) and the ODUCn contains an
   optical payload unit (OPUCn).  OTUCn, ODUCn and OPUCn are presented
   in an interface independent manner, by means of n OTUC, ODUC and OPUC
   instances that are marked #1 to #n through inverse multiplexing.

   This document reviews relevant aspects of OTN technology evolution
   that affect the GMPLS control-plane protocols, examines why and how
   to update the mechanisms described in former G.709 related documents
   and describes the framework and solution for GMPLS control of ODUCn
   network.

   For the purposes of the control plane, the OTN can be considered to
   be comprised of ODU and wavelength (Optical Channel (OCh)/ Optical
   Tributary Signal (OTSi)) layers.  This document focuses on the
   control of the ODU layer, with control of the wavelength layer
   considered out of the scope.

   This section provides an informative overview of the aspects of the
   OTN impacting control-plane protocols.  This overview is based on the
   ITU-T Recommendations that contain the normative definition of the
   OTN.  Technical details regarding OTN architecture and interfaces are
   provided in the relevant ITU-T Recommendations.

3.1.  OTN ODUCn layer network

   Figure 1 shows a simplified signal hierarchy of OTN ODUCn, which
   illustrates the layers that are related to control plane.

   ODUCn can no be used to support non-OTN client signal.  OTN client
   signals (e.g.  ODU0, ODU1, ODU2, ODU2e, ODU3, ODU4, ODUflex) are

   mapped into an ODUCn container, ODUCn container is then multiplexed
   into OTUCn.  The approximate bit rates of these signals are defined
   in [G709-2016] and are reproduced in Figure 2.

3.2.  Time Slot Granularity

   The initial versions of G.709 referenced by [RFC4328] only provided a
   single TS granularity, nominally 2.5 Gbps.  [G709-2012] added an
   additional TS granularity, nominally 1.25 Gbps.  [G709-2012] added
   another 5 Gbps TS granularity specially for ODUCn.  The number of
   tributary slots (TS) defined in [G709-2016] for each ODU are
   reproduced in Figure 3.

3.3.  Structure of MSI Information

   When multiplexing an OTN client signal into ODUCn, [G.709-2016]
   specifies the information that has to be transported in-band in order
   to allow for correct demultiplexing.  This information, known as MSI,
   is transported in the OPUCn overhead and is local to each link.

   The MSI information is organized as a set of entries, with n entries
   for each OPUC TS.  The MSI indicates the ODTU content of each
   tributary slot of an OPU.  Two bytes are used for each tributary
   slot.  The information carried by each entry is:

   - TS availability bit 1 indicates if the tributary slot is available
   or unavailable.

   - The TS occupation bit 9 indicates if the tributary slot is
   allocated or unallocated.

   - Payload Type: the type of the transported payload.

   - TPN: the port number of the OTN client signal transported by the
   ODUCn.  The TPN is the same for all the TSs assigned to the transport
   of the same OTN client signal.

Internet-Draft            GMPLS ODUCn Framework             October 2016


3.4.  OTUCn sub rates (OTUCn-M)

   An OTUCn with a bit rate that is not an integer multiple of 100 Gbit/
   s is described as an OTUCn M, it carries n instances of OTUC
   overhead, ODUC overhead and OPUC overhead together with M 5Gbit/s
   OPUCn TS.  An ODUCn M and OPUCn M are not defined.  When an OTUCn M
   is used to carry an ODUCn (20n-M) TS are marked as unavailable, in
   the OPUCn multiplex structure identifier (MSI), since they cannot be
   used to carry a client.

4.  Connection Management of ODUCn

   ODUCn based connection management is concerned with controlling the
   connectivity of ODUCn paths.  As described in [G.872], The ODUk
   subnetwork does not support an ODUCn, which means intermediate ODUCn
   points do not support the switching of ODUCn time slot, intermediate
   ODUCn point only functions as a forwarding point.  Once an ODUCn path
   is used to transport client signal, the TS occupied will not changed
   across the ODUCn network.

5.  GMPLS Implications

   The purpose of this section is to provide a set of requirements to be
   evaluated for extensions of the current GMPLS protocol suite to
   encompass OTN enhancements and connection management.

5.1.  Implications for GMPLS Signalling

   As described in Section 3, [G709-2016] introduced some new features,
   such as OTUCn, ODUCn and OPUCn.  The mechanisms defined in [RFC4328]
   and [RFC7139] do not support such new OTN features, and protocol
   extensions will be necessary to allow them to be controlled by a
   GMPLS control plane.  The following signaLling aspects should be
   considered:

   - Support for specifying new signal types and related traffic
   information.  The traffic parameters should be extended in a
   signalling message to support the new ODUCn

   - Support for LSP setup using different TS granularity

   - Support for LSP setup of new ODUCn containers with related mapping
   and multiplexing capabilities

   - Support for TPN allocation and negotiation

   - Support for LSP setup of OTUCn sub rates (OTUCn-M) path

   Note: ODU Virtual Concatenation (VCAT) and Link Capacity Adjustment
   Scheme (LCAS) is not supported in ODUCn network.

5.2.  Implications for GMPLS Routing

   The path computation process needs to select a suitable route for an
   ODUCn connection request.  In order to perform the path computation,
   it needs to evaluate the available bandwidth on one or more candidate
   links.  The routing protocol should be extended to convey sufficient
   information to represent ODU Traffic Engineering (TE) topology.
   Following requirements should be considered:

   - Support for Tributary Slot Granularity advertisement

   - Support for carrying the link multiplexing capability

   The routing protocol should be able to indicate which link supports
   the ODUCn forwarding.

   - Support for advertisement of OTUCn sub rates support information
