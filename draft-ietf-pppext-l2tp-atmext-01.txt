Abstract

   [L2TP] specifies a protocol which permits the tunnelling of the link
   layer of PPP over packet based networks, to support remote access
   (mainly) by ISDN and PSTN networks. This document augments the
   procedures described in [L2TP] to further support ATM SVC or PVC
   based access networks. The extensions defined within this document
   allow for asymmetric bi-directional call establishment and service
   selection in the ATM access network.

1. Introduction

   [L2TP] is a tunnelling protocol that allows tunnelling of PPP
   sessions between a so called L2TP Access Concentrator (LAC) and an
   L2TP Network Server (LNS). The main focus of [L2TP] is on supporting
   HDLC based ISDN/PSTN access networks.

   This document augments the procedures described in [L2TP] to further
   support ATM SVC or PVC based access networks. Support for ATM access
   networks requires extensions to the present L2TP procedures along the
   following lines :

   (a) the traffic management aspects of ATM connections (e.g.
   assymetric bandwidth allocation and service category selection
   capabilities),

   (b) the addressing format to be used in switched ATM networks [AESA]
   and

   (c) the limititations imposed on LCP negotiation by transporting PPP
   over AAL5 over the access network segment of the PPP connection
   [PPPoA].

   Within this draft, the necessary extensions to [L2TP] are defined to

   cope with issues (a) and (b), issue (c) which is not specific to ATM
   may be solved as described in [L2TP_link].

2. Assumptions

   In this section we describe some assumptions that have lead to the
   extensions described in this draft.

2.1 Topology

   The procedures as defined in [L2TP] apply mainly to access network



T'Joens, et al.          Expires December 1999                  [Page 3]

Internet Draft    draft-ietf-pppext-l2tp-atmext-01.txt         June 1999


   technology such as PSTN and ISDN, which may be respectively asynch.
   HDLC and synch HDLC based. The aim of this document is to extend L2TP
   support to allow for user / LAC communication based on ATM access
   network technology.

2.2 Connection Establishment

   Due to the wide variety of existing signalling protocols and ATM
   service categories, and their support or non-support within ATM based
   access networks, this document takes as approach to provide for a
   flexible identification of ATM connection characteristics while
   establishing outgoing and incoming L2TP calls. The procedures as
   defined within this document allow the allocation of asymmetric
   bandwidth and service category selection in terms of real or non-real
   time requirements on the ATM portion of the access network.

   As such, the detailed signalling protocol specific information
   elements that are necessary for switched VC service, are not
   negotiated during call establishment over the L2TP tunnel.

   In order to identify the endpoint of the ATM connection within the
   ATM access network, SVCs can be established on the basis of the ATM
   end system addressing format [AESA]. For PVC based services, the PVC
   can either be referred to by using the ATM end system addressing
   procedure (Dialed Number), or by making use of a textual name
   (Service Name). The latter is inspired by the procedures defined
   within [Auto_PVC].

2.3 LCP negotiation

   The procedures described within this draft may be combined with the
   procedures described in [L2TP_link] to limit LCP negotiation between
   LNS and user, so as to enforce PPP over AAL5 specific LCP negotiation
   [PPPoA].

3. ATM access enhanced procedures

   In order to illustrate the procedures specified within this draft,
   this section will provide a description of what might happen when a
   Virtual dial-up client initiates access through a (switched) ATM
   access network. Note that the emphasis is on the changes proposed
   within this draft relative to [L2TP].

3.1 ATM connectivity

   Prior to initiating the PPP protocol layer, a Virtual Connection (VC)
   MUST be established between the user and the Network Access Server
   (LAC). This virtual connection MAY either be a preconfigured



T'Joens, et al.          Expires December 1999                  [Page 4]

Internet Draft    draft-ietf-pppext-l2tp-atmext-01.txt         June 1999


   Permanent VC(PVC), where the access network provider, NAS and user
   agree beforehand on the characteristics of the PVC, or MAY be an on-
   demand switched VC(SVC), where the negotiation between user, network
   and NAS takes place by means of an ATM signalling protocol. Note that
   for establishing PVCs, alternative use may be made of the procedures
   as described in [Auto_PVC].

   In both cases, the user is referred to as the Virtual dial-in user.

   Prior to accepting the switched connection from the Virtual dial-in
   user, the LAC MAY check with the LNS whether the call should be
   accepted. In the latter situation, the LAC MAY determine based upon
   parameters available within the call establishment message that this
   concerns a virtual dial in user, or MAY undertake a partial
   authentication of the end system/user, in order to bind the end
   system/user with a specific LNS.

3.2 Tunnel establishment

   If no tunnel connection currently exists to the desired LNS, one is
   initiated. During the tunnel establishment, LNS and LAC indicate
   bearer and framing capabilities to each other, according to normal
   procedures.

   The bearer capability is extended to allow the identification of ATM
   devices in the LAC. This allows the LNS to use the extensions as
   defined within this draft to support ATM based outgoing calls.

   If no compatibility between LNS and LAC exists according to the
   extensions defined within this draft, no tunnel establishment can
   take place. This would be because the LAC does not support any bearer
   capability which is expected by the LNS, or vice versa. It is however
   encouraged that LAC or LNS implementations would allow for seamless
   interworking with peer devices which do not implement the extensions
   defined within this draft. This could be implemented by allowing a
   gracefull fallback to Digital bearer capability.


3.3 call establishment

   During incoming and outgoing broadband call establishment, the
   following extensions are defined to existing procedures.

   During OCRQ, the LNS MUST indicate to the LAC minimum and maximum
   speeds for receive and transmit traffic (from the LAC perspective).
   This is to allow for the bi-directional asymmetric nature of ATM
   traffic contracts. Note that in order to support UBR connections
   between LAC and user, the Minimum BPS MUST be set to zero.



T'Joens, et al.          Expires December 1999                  [Page 5]

Internet Draft    draft-ietf-pppext-l2tp-atmext-01.txt         June 1999


   Further during OCRQ, the LNS MAY indicate to the LAC the required
   service category, i.e., real time (rt) or non-real time (nrt)
   transport services. The combination of minimum and maximum receive
   and transmit speed, and the indication of the required service
   category allows the LAC to establish an ATM connection according to
   its own capabilities, and the ATM access network capabilities,
   however within the service requirement for the PPP layer.

   Real time connectivity can be provided by either CBR or rt-VBR ATM
   service categories, non-real time connectivity can be provided by
   UBR, nrt-VBR, ABR or GFR ATM service categories.

   Further the LNS MUST indicate to the LAC in OCRQ message the dialed
   number according to the format described in this document (NSAP
   format). When the dialed number carries an all zero payload, the LAC
   SHOULD look at the Service Name AVP to bind the tunnel call to an
   PVC.

3.4 Framing

   Within this document the PPP PDU refers to the concatenation of PPP
   protocol ID, PPP Information and PPP padding fields.

   In the direction of user to LNS, the PPP PDU will be carried on top
   of an AAL5 connection between user and LAC. The LAC MUST strip off
   the AAL5 specific fields based on the encapsulation mechanism in use
   on the ATM connection, i.e. VC multiplexed or LLC encapsulated
   [PPPoA], and MUST encapsulate the PPP PDU with address and control
   field, as per HDLC procedures, on the L2TP tunnel.

   In the direction of LNS to user, the PPP PDU will be carried on top
   of an AAL5 connection between LAC and user. The LAC MUST strip the
   PPP PDU from the address and control field on the L2TP tunnel, and
   insert the AAL5 specific fields based on the encapsulation mechanism
   in use on the ATM connection, i.e. VC multiplexed or LLC
   encapsulated.


4. Service model issues

4.1 Authentication

   In case of ATM switched VC establishment, calling party number
   information may be used for first level authentication much in the
   same way as for PSTN or ISDN access. In case of permanent VC
   establishment, authentication may not be an issue from the LAC side,
   because of the permanent character of the VC. Bilateral agreement
   between LAC and LNS providers may eliminate the authentication phase

Internet Draft    draft-ietf-pppext-l2tp-atmext-01.txt         June 1999


   in the latter case.

4.2 Authorization

   Because of the flexibility of establishing ATM connections with
   varying parameters, some authorization may be required prior to
   accepting the establishment of a switched ATM connection from the
   user with certain ATM traffic parameters. This authorization may be
   performed against the ATM specific authentication information (e.g.
   calling line id), or may be performed after partial authentication of
   the user at the PPP level. Non authorized access requests result in
   connection release.

5. New and extended AVPs

5.1 New AVP Summary

   The following table lists the extra AVPs that are defined within this
   document. The "attr" column indicates the integer value assigned to
   this attribute.  Note that the attribute value is relative compared
   to the vendor ID. The "M" column indicates the setting of the
   "Mandatory" bit of the AVP header for each attribute. The "LEN"
   column indicates the size of the AVP including the AVP header. A "+"
   in this column indicates that the length varies depending upon the
   length of the actual contents of the value field.

   The usage list for each entry indicates the message types that
   utilize each AVP. An abbreviation shown in mixed or upper case
   letters indicates that the corresponding AVP MUST be present in this
   message type. All lower case indicates that the AVP MAY optionally
   appear in this message type. Some AVPs MAY be present only when a
   corresponding optional AVP or specific setting within the AVP is
   present, these AVPs are shown in lower case as well.

        The bearer Capabilities AVP within a SCCRQ or SCCRP indicates
        the bearer capabilities that the sender of this message can
        provide for outgoing calls. If bit B is set, broadband access is
        supported (ATM), if bit A is set, analogue access is supported.
        If bit D is set, Digital access is supported.

        This AVP provides the peer with an indication of the bearer
        device types supported by the hardware interfaces of the sender
        for outgoing calls. An LNS SHOULD NOT initiate an outgoing call
        specifying a value in the Bearer Type AVP for a device type not
        advertised in the Bearer Capabilities AVP it received from the
        LAC during control connection establishment. Attempts to do so
        will result in the call being rejected.

        In these cases where the LAC only supports the B bit, and the
        LNS would not recognize the B bit, no outgoing calls are
        possible. Note that when the LAC only has ATM based devices, it
        may still opt for fall back to digital bearer types.

   (Tx) Minimum BPS

        The (Tx) Minimum BPS AVP encodes the lowest acceptable line
        speed for this call in the transmit direction. The (Tx) Minimum
        BPS AVP MAY be used in OCRQ. If the Rx Minimum BPS is not
        available in the message, then symmetric transmission is
        implied, with both minimum receive and transmit bit-rates equal
        to Minimum BPS.

        (Tx) Minimum BPS is set in bits/second, and may be mapped to the
        PCR in cells/second for ATM based traffic. Note that the PCR is
        a mandatory parameter for all service capabilities in ATM
        signalling. The exact mapping to signalling IEs is outside the
        scope of this draft.

   (Tx) Maximum BPS

        (Tx) Maximum BPS AVP encodes the highest acceptable line speed
        for this call in the transmit direction. The (Tx) Maximum BPS
        AVP MAY be used in OCRQ. If the Rx Maximum BPS AVP is not
        available in the message, then symmetric transmission is
        implied, with both maximum receive and transmit bitrates equal
        to Maximum BPS.

        (Tx) Maximum BPS is set in bits/second, and may be mapped to the
        PCR in cells/second for ATM based traffic. Note that the PCR is
        a mandatory parameter for all service capabilities in ATM
        signalling. The exact mapping to signalling IEs is outside the
        scope of this draft.

        The bearer type AVP encodes the bearer type for the requested
        call. The bearer type AVP MUST be present in the OCRQ, and MAY
        be present in the ICRQ. If bit B is set, broadband access is
        requested (ATM), if bit A is set, analogue access is requested.
        If bit D is set, Digital access is requested.

        Note that in the OCRQ all 3 bits (B,A,D) may be set indicating
        that the call may be of either type. The B bit SHOULD only be
        set if the Broadband capability was indicated during tunnel
        establishment.

        The Dialed Number AVP indicates the number that should be used
        to address the virtual dial in user. The Dialed number AVP MUST
        be present in OCRQ, and MAY be present in ICRQ. The Dialed
        number AVP SHOULD be interpreted as binary encoded when the B

        bit is set in the Bearer Type AVP. The NSAP binary encoded
        address provides a broader range of address encapsulation
        methods than an ASCII field. In the NSAP field, which MUST have
        the length of 20 octets, the addressing protocol used (E.164,
        ICD, DCC) is specified as defined in [AESA].

        If the Dialed Number AVP carries an all zero NSAP address, the
        Service Name AVP MAY provide further information to bind the
        L2TP call to a specific VC connection. See also [Auto_PVC].

   Sub-Address

        see Dialed Number. If the Dialed Number carries an all zero NSAP
        address, the Sub-Address should be neglected on receipt.

6. IANA Considerations

   This document requires 5 new type values for the following AVPs : -
   Rx Minimum BPS - Rx Maximum BPS - ATM Cause Code - Service Category -
   Service Name

   This document further defines a new bit (B) in the bearer
   capabilities and bearer type AVPs.

   This document defines a flag field in the Service Category AVP, only
   one bit in this flag has been assigned witin this document (S).

7. Security Considerations

   No extra security risk outside these specified by [L2TP] are
   foreseen.
