Abstract

   The purpose of MOBIKE is the creation and maintenance a set of
   available addresses and provide them to the communication partner.  A
   MOBIKE peer should have some information about the status of each
   address and interface in order to execute the respective actions.
   Examples may comprise switching from address or interface to another.
   This information, which will be referred as trigger, is distributed
   over a number of protocols daemons at an end host.  To make this

   information available to the MOBIKE daemon it is necessary to store
   it centrally at the host (called trigger database) and to enable the
   protocols to insert the triggers and to allow MOBIKE to obtain timely
   information.

1.  Introduction

   When a MOBIKE implementation is started first it has to build a set
   of all available addresses (or a subset of them for policy reasons;
   see [3]) before communicating with another peer.  From these
   addresses, it has to select one of the addresses as preferred address
   that will be used as the source address in the communication with the
   MOBIKE peer.

   This address set together with the preferred address may change
   during operation because of several reasons, e.g. an interface could
   be disconnected or the communication path becomes unavailable due to
   router failure.  Many of the events, which cause the change of the
   address set, are out of the scope of the MOBIKE protocol itself but
   need an interaction with other protocols daemons locally at the end
   host.

   For MOBIKE to work, it is really important to know about the status
   of the available addresses in order to make reasonable decisions.  A
   number of other protocols running on the end host might have various
   information necessary to derive a decision whether to switch from one
   preferred address to another or whether it is necessary to modify the
   peer address set.

   In this document, we therefore suggest to define an API that allows
   protocol daemons to insert information (triggers) into a "database"
   that can later be made available to the MOBIKE daemon.  The API is
   based on the BSD routing socket API in a similar fashion as PF_KEY
   [1] extends the same API for generic key management usage.  This
   document therefore heavily focuses on the functionality offered by
   the PF_KEY specification.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [2].

   Additionally, the following terms are introduced:

   o  Trigger: Information which is relevant for MOBIKE about an
      address.

   o  Trigger Database (TDB): Collection of triggers which can be
      accessed via the API defined in this document.

3.  Trigger Classification

   Many different events may cause a change in the address set used by
   MOBIKE (see [3]).  These events can be notified by many different
   protocols running in kernel or user space.  Since the reaction (if
   any) on a given event depends on the type of the event, a
   classification of these events is necessary.

   As an example, we define the following triggers in this document:

   Trigger type                   Value     Description
   ---------------------------+-------+-------------------------------
   TDB_TTYPE_IF_ADDED         |   1   | New interface added
   TDB_TTYPE_IF_REMOVED       |   2   | Interface removed
   TDB_TTYPE_IF_ADDRADDED     |   3   | New address added to interface
   TDB_TTYPE_IF_ADDRREMOVED   |   4   | Address removed from interface
   TDB_TTYPE_IF_ADDRCHANGED   |   5   | Interface has changed one of its
                              |       | addresses (e.g. new DHCP lease)
   TDB_TTYPE_TUNNEL_ADDED     |   6   | IPSec tunnel was established
   TDB_TTYPE_TUNNEL_CHANGED   |   7   | IPSec tunnel conf. changed
   TDB_TTYPE_TUNNEL_REMOVED   |   8   | IPSec tunnel was removed
   TDB_TTYPE_CONN_ESTABLISHED |   9   | e.g. dial-in network
                              |       | has connected
   TDB_TTYPE_CONN_LOST        |   10  | connection to network lost
   TDB_TTYPE_DEST_UNREACHABLE |   11  | e.g. ICMP packet received
   TDB_TTYPE_MAX              |   12  | Maximum value for trigger types

   A future version of this document will add more triggers and a more
   detailed description of them.  The types TDB_TTYPE_TUNNEL_ADDED,
   TDB_TTYPE_TUNNEL_CHANGED and TDB_TTYPE_TUNNEL_REMOVED are inspired by
   [4].

   The above listed trigger types will be signaled using the
   "tdb_trigger" message structure described in Section 6

4.  API for the Trigger Database

   To access the trigger database, an API is defined.  For that purpose
   the new network protocol family ID PF_TRIGGER has to be defined.  The
   operation of the API is analogue to the PF_KEY interface (see [1]).

   To access the API, a socket of the family PF_TRIGGER has to be
   created.  To communicate with the Trigger Database, messages are sent
   and received through the socket with the send and recv commands.  Any
   other commands like bind, connect, etc. are not supported and MUST
   NOT have any effects on a socket of the PF_TRIGGER family.

   The following exhibits an example socket creation:

   int s = socket(PF_TRIGGER, SOCK_RAW, PF_TRIGGER);

   The format of the messages is the following: Each message starts with
   a fixed header.  Appended to this header, there are some payloads
   depending on the type of the message.  The available message types
   are described in Section 5.

   Each time when a message is sent to the Trigger Database, it will
   respond with a message of the same type.  This response contains the
   same payloads as transmitted to the Trigger Database, only some
   additional information MAY be included (e.g., the Trigger Database
   assigns an id to each trigger).

   The normal operation works in the following way: A MOBIKE
   implementation, which wants to be informed about every new trigger,
   registers itself to the Trigger Database by sending a TDB_REGISTER
   message.  If a protocol daemon wants to add a new trigger, it sends a
   TDB_ADD message to the Trigger Database including information that is
   important for this new trigger.

   The Trigger Database acknowledges this message with a TDB_ADD
   response to the network protocol and with a TDB_NOTIFY message to the
   registered MOBIKE implementation.  This notify message contains some
   information about the new trigger including its id.  All information
   available about the new trigger can be requested with a TDB_GET
   message.

   In a future version of this document, we will try to add some
   information about scenarios to better illustrate the interaction.

5.  Supported Message Types

   Several different message types can be sent to the Trigger Database
   using a PF_TRIGGER socket.  The message type is indicated by the
   tdb_header_msgtype field that is part of the generic message header
   (see Section 6) and can be one of the following values:

   Message type        Value     Description
   ------------------+---------+------------------------------
   TDB_ADD           |   1     | Add a trigger to the
                     |         | Trigger Database
   TDB_GET           |   2     | Get information about an
                     |         | existing trigger.
   TDB_DELETE        |   3     | Delete a trigger from the
                     |         | Trigger Database
   TDB_REGISTER      |   4     | Register an application
                     |         | to receive a messages for
                     |         | each new trigger added.
   TDB_NOTIFY        |   5     | A new trigger has been
                     |         | added, deleted or updated.
   TDB_MODIFY        |   6     | Modify a trigger in the
                     |         | Trigger Database
   TDB_DUMP          |   7     | Dump all Trigger Database
                     |         | entries
   TDB_FLUSH         |   8     | Delete all Trigger Database
                     |         | entries
   TDB_MAX           |   9     | Generic maximum for message
                     |         | types

   Each message type requires different payloads to be appended.  Each
   payload starts with a generic payload header followed by payload
   specific data.  The generic header has the following structure:

   struct tdb_payload {
           uint16_t        tdb_payload_len;
           uint16_t        tdb_payload_type;
   } __attribute__( ( packed ) );
   /* sizeof( struct tdb_payload ) == 4 */

   The tdb_payload_len field contains the length of the payload divided
   by 8.  The type of the payload is determined by the tdb_payload_type
   field, which contains one of the following values:

   Payload type                 Value     Description
   ---------------------------+---------+-------------------------------
   TDB_PT_INTERFACE           |   1     | Information about an interface
   TDB_PT_ADDRESS             |   2     | The IP address of an IF
   TDB_PT_TRIGGER             |   3     | Trigger id, type, etc.

Internet-Draft    API to a Trigger Database for MOBIKE         July 2005


   Details about the supported message types and their formats can be
   found below:


   TDB_ADD:

      If an application or network protocol wants to add a new trigger,
      it sends a TDB_ADD message to the Trigger Database.  The new
      trigger is stored in the Trigger Database and a corresponding
      TDB_NOTIFY message that indicates that a new trigger has been
      added is sent to all registered applications.

      The format of the message is:

      <HEADER, TRIGGER, INTERFACE, [ADDRESS]>

      The TRIGGER payload indicates the type of the trigger and also
      includes some trigger specific data.  The INTERFACE payload is
      needed to select the appropriate hardware interface, the new
      trigger is related to.  For many triggers, an additional address
      payload is required.  It contains, for example, the new address
      for a TDB_TTYPE_IF_ADDRCHANGED trigger.

      The response from the Trigger Database contains the same
      information as the request:

      <HEADER, TRIGGER, INTERFACE, [ADDRESS]>

   TDB_DELETE:

      A trigger, which is stored inside the Trigger Database, can be
      deleted using the TDB_DELETE payload.  In the request the only
      information, which has to be specified is the id of the trigger,
      which is stored in 'TRIGGER(*)'.

      The format of the message is:

      <HEADER, TRIGGER(*)>

      The Trigger Database responds with a message with the following
      format:

      <HEADER, TRIGGER>

      In the response, the TRIGGER payload has all fields filled with
      the correct values.

Internet-Draft    API to a Trigger Database for MOBIKE         July 2005


   TDB_GET:

      The TDB_GET message is used to request all available information
      of a specified trigger.  In the request the only information,
      which has to be specified is the id of the trigger, which is
      stored in 'TRIGGER(*)'.

      The format of the message is:

      <HEADER, TRIGGER(*)>

      The Trigger Database responds with a message of the following
      format:

      <HEADER, TRIGGER, INTERFACE, [ADDRESS]>

      In the response a fully initialized TRIGGER payload is present.
      Additionally, INTERFACE payload is present as well as and an
      optional an ADDRESS payload, if an address is available for the
      specified trigger.

   TDB_REGISTER:

      An application, which is interested in each new trigger, can
      register itself to the Trigger Database.  After the application
      has registered, it receives a message each time a new trigger has
      been added to the database.  The format of the message is:

      <HEADER>

      No additional payload has to be added.  The Trigger Database
      responds with a message of the same type and with the same
      content, i.e. its format is:

      <HEADER>

   TDB_NOTIFY

      An application that has registered itself to get informed about
      the new triggers or updates to these triggers, receives a
      TDB_NOTIFY message.  The format of the message is the same as for
      a TDB_ADD message.  The only difference is that some field are
      filled by the Trigger Database before sending the TDB_NOTIFY
      message.

      The format of the message is:

Internet-Draft    API to a Trigger Database for MOBIKE         July 2005


      <HEADER, TRIGGER, [INTERFACE], [ADDRESS]>

      Since this message is sent by the Trigger Database itself, a
      registered application MUST NOT respond to it.

   TDB_MODIFY:

      If an application or a network protocol wants to modify a new
      trigger (because its status has changed), it sends a TDB_MODIFY
      message to the Trigger Database.  The new trigger is stored and a
      corresponding TDB_NOTIFY message that indicates that an existing
      trigger has been modified is sent to all registered applications.

      The format of the message is:

      <HEADER, TRIGGER, [INTERFACE], [ADDRESS]>

      The TRIGGER payload indicates the type of the trigger and also
      includes some trigger specific data.

      The response from the Trigger Database contains the same
      information as the request:

      <HEADER, TRIGGER, [INTERFACE], [ADDRESS]>

   TDB_DUMP:

      An application, that wants to learn all currently available
      triggers should send a TDB_DUMP message.  Since a TDB_GET message
      requires a specific trigger id for retrieval, applications which
      to not know all trigger ids depend on this message class for
      learning all unknown triggers.  The format of the message is:

      <HEADER>

      The Trigger Database will respond with all currently available
      triggers entries by serially sending the following message:

      <HEADER, TRIGGER, INTERFACE, [ADDRESS]>

   TDB_FLUSH:

      For deleting all entries in a Trigger Database, the TDB_FLUSH
      message is used.  Since the TDB_GET message requires a specific
      trigger id for deletion, reliable cleaning of a Trigger Database
      can be done with this message.  The format of the message is:

6.  Payload Format

   HEADER:

      Each message starts with the fixed header.  It contains general
      information about the message and determines, which payloads have
      to be included in it.  It has the following format:

   struct tdb_header {
           uint8_t         tdb_header_version;
           uint8_t         tdb_header_msgtype;
           uint8_t         tdb_header_errno;
           uint8_t         tdb_header_reserved1;
           uint16_t        tdb_header_msglen;
           uint16_t        tdb_header_reserved2;
           uint32_t        tdb_header_seq;
           uint32_t        tdb_header_pid;
   } __attribute__( ( packed ) );
   /* sizeof( struct tdb_header ) == 16 */


      The fields of this structure contain the following values:


      tdb_header_version: The version of the used PF_TRIGGER interface.
         This document specifies this API in version 1.


      tdb_header_msgtype: This field contains the type of the message.
         All possible values are listed in the table in Section 5.


      tdb_header_errno: If an error occurred while processing a request,
         the response will only include the message header without any
         payloads.  The type of the error is indicated by the value in
         this field.  The values are taken from the error number
         specification of the operating system (e.g. the errno.h file).


      tdb_header_msglen: The length of the message divided by 8 is
         stored into this field.


      tdb_header_seq: This field contains the number of the last message
         sent incremented by 1.

Internet-Draft    API to a Trigger Database for MOBIKE         July 2005


      tdb_header_pid: The process id of the program sending the message.
         If the message is generated inside the kernel, this value is
         set to zero.


   INTERFACE:

      The INTERFACE payload is used to provide all needed information
      about an active network interface.

      The format of the INTERFACE payload is the following:

   struct tdb_interface {
           uint16_t        tdb_interface_len;
           uint16_t        tdb_interface_pltype;
                   uint32_t        tdb_interface_selector;
           uint32_t        tdb_interface_type;
           uint32_t        tdb_interface_quality;
   } __attribute__( ( packed ) );
   /* sizeof( struct tdb_interface ) == 16 */


      This fields contain the following values:


      tdb_interface_len: This field contains the length of the payload
         divided by 8.


      tdb_interface_pltype: This field contains the value
         TDB_PT_INTERFACE.


      tdb_interface_selector: The tdb_interface_selector field stores
         interface enumeration information for unique identification (IF
         #0, #1, #2, ...).  When a new interface comes up, this value
         should be set by the kernel.


      tdb_interface_type: Information about classification of an
         interface, for instance Indication, of fixed or wireless
         network link and theoretical maximum bandwidth.


      tdb_interface_quality: This field provides quality information
         about a certain interface for making interface selections
         possible (e.g. load balancing; handover).  This value should be
         a very general indicator calculated and set by the kernel

         space.  It could be based on latency (ping), signal quality for
         wireless links, packet-loss rate and average data-throughput/
         bandwidth.  (Author's note: If a single value is not
         reasonable, separate indicators for all these evaluation
         criteria's should be defined.)


      Further information about an interface might be necessary.  This
      is left for future investigation.


   ADDRESS:

      The ADDRESS payload is used to provide the IP address of an
      interface to the Trigger Database or registered application.  This
      information is important for most triggers.  But it might be
      possible that there trigger types that do not need an ADDRESS
      payload.

      The format of the ADDRESS payload is:

   struct tdb_address {
           uint16_t tdb_address_len;
           uint16_t tdb_address_pltype;
           uint8_t tdb_address_proto;
           uint8_t tdb_address_prefixlen;
           uint16_t tdb_address_reserved;
   } __attribute__( ( packed ) );
   /* sizeof( struct tdb_address ) == 8 */

   /* followed by some form of struct sockaddr */


      Information about IP address and probably ports is provided by a
      sockaddr structure which is attached to the tdb_address structure.
      A sockaddr structure is capable of storing both a IPv4 and IPv6
      address.  The fields of the tdb_address structure contains the
      following values:


      tdb_address_len: This field contains the length of the payload
         including the sockaddr structure divided by 8.


      tdb_address_pltype: The tdb_address_pltype field contains the
         value TDB_PT_ADDRESS.

      tdb_address_proto: The tdb_address_proto field is normally set to
         zero.  However, if is are set in the attached sockaddr needed,
         then the field SHOULD be set to the protocol number of the
         upper layer protocol. (e.g.  TCP or UDP).  This functionality
         may become relevant for signaling IPSec related information
         (e.g. tunnel changes)


      tdb_address_prefixlen: This field contains the prefix length of
         the address.


      tdb_address_reserved: The tdb_address_reserved field is reserved
         for future use and MUST be set to zero.



      TBD: Clarification about the prefix len needs to be provided in a
      future document version.


   TRIGGER:

      The TRIGGER payload is used to provide all needed information
      about a trigger itself, e.g. the trigger type, an id, etc.  The
      notation TRIGGER(*) indicates that only the id field is used to
      identify the trigger and all other fields SHOULD be set to zero.

      The format of the TRIGGER payload is the following:

   struct tdb_trigger {
           uint16_t        tdb_trigger_len;
           uint16_t        tdb_trigger_pltype;
           uint16_t        tdb_trigger_type;
           uint16_t        tdb_trigger_reserved1;
           uint32_t        tdb_trigger_id;
           uint32_t        tdb_trigger_reserved2;
   } __attribute__( ( packed ) );
   /* sizeof( struct tdb_trigger ) == 16 */


      This fields contain the following values:


      tdb_address_len: This field contains the length of the payload
         divided by 8.

      tdb_address_pltype: This field contains the value TDB_PT_TRIGGER.


      tdb_address_type: The type of the trigger is stored into this
         field.  All possible values are listed in the table in section
         Section 3.


      tdb_address_id: The id of a trigger is assigned by the Trigger
         Database itself.  In the message sent by userspace programs,
         which do not know this value (e.g. for TDB_ADD messages), this
         value MUST be set to zero.



      Further information about a trigger might be necessary.  This is
      left for future investigation.

7.  Applicability

   Even though this document is intended to give a solution for MOBIKE,
   the API is generic enough to make information available for other
   protocols as well.

   The Next Step In Signaling (NSIS) protocol suite, for example,
   requires access to up-to-date information about IP addresses,
   interfaces and interactions with mobility protocols.  In order to
   react on mobility events some sort of interaction between the kernel,
   various signaling protocols (including Mobile IP, IKE/IPsec, etc.)
   and the NSIS daemon is required (see [5]).  Hence, an NSIS daemon
   supporting mobility could benefit from a generic interface to meet
   it's requirements for fast and accurate detection of mobility events,
   address and interface changes.  GIMPS, for example, demands immediate
   reaction in case of a mobility event (e.g., handover).  Monitoring
   procedures of mobility management protocols like Mobile IP are
   required to react to these mobility events in an appropriate way.

   The trigger database and it's API could provide necessary information
   for detecting such a movement (new interface/IP address available,
   expiring Mobile IP timers).

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines an IANA registry for the protocol family
   PF_TRIGGER.

   An IANA registry might be needed for the different trigger types (for
   which examples are provided in Section 3).

9.  Security Considerations

   This document describes an API which allows information about IP
   addresses to be obtained at a local host.  A malicious application or
   protocol daemon could disseminate wrong information.  This would make
   other protocols, such as MOBIKE, believe that the status of a
   particular address has changed.  This will likely lead to unexpected
   protocol behavior, such as switching between addresses back-and-
   forth.  Hence, a certain trust has to be placed into the applications
   and protocol daemons that are allowed to access the database to
   insert, modify or delete triggers.  Access control mechanisms might
   enforce certain rights to use the API or parts of it.
