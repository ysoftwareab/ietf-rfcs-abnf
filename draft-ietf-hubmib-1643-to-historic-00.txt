Abstract

   RFC 1643, "Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like
   Interface Types", currently STD 50, is inadequate for managing the
   Ethernet interface types that have been developed since 1994.  The
   most up-to-date version of that specification, RFC xxxx, is currently
   a Proposed Standard.  In order to encourage implementors to use that
   version of the specification instead of RFC 1643, this document
   requests that RFC 1643 be moved to Historic status.

Internet Draft         RFC 1643 to Historic Status              May 2002


1.  Details

   STD 50, RFC 1643 [RFC1643], "Definitions of Managed Objects for the
   Ethernet-like Interface Types", covers only 10 Mb/s Ethernet
   interfaces.  Since its publication in 1994, 100 Mb/s, 1000 Mb/s, and
   10 Gb/s Ethernet interface types have been developed, and updates to
   the specification have been developed to encompass these new
   technologies [RFC2358] [RFC2665] [RFCxxxx].  These updates define new
   MIB objects to supplement those originally defined in RFC 1643 and in
   addition deprecate some of the objects defined in RFC 1643 that are
   no longer useful.

   RFC 1643 is an obsolete specification, overtaken by events.  Having
   it remain an Internet Standard while the replacement RFCs make their
   way through the standards track serves no useful purpose and may even
   have the undesirable effect of encouraging vendors to implement it
   instead of its more up-to-date replacements.  It is therefore
   recommended that it be reclassified as Historic.

2.  Effect on Other Standards Track Documents

   Reclassification of RFC 1643 will have no impact on the status of any
   standards track RFC because no standards track RFC cites it as a
   normative reference.  An RFC content search made with the tools
   available at http://www.rfc-editor.org reveals the following
   standards track documents that cite RFC 1643:

      RFC 2020 IEEE 802.12 Interface MIB J. Flick

      RFC 2358 Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like
      Interface Types J. Flick, J. Johnson

      RFC 2665 Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like
      Interface Types J. Flick, J. Johnson

      RFC 2720 Traffic Flow Measurement: Meter MIB N. Brownlee

      RFC xxxx Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like
      Interface Types J. Flick

   RFC 2020 [RFC2020] contains DOT12-IF-MIB, which is the MIB module for
   managing IEEE 802.12 100VG-AnyLAN interfaces.  It refers to RFC 1643
   in the context of an admonition not to implement the EthernetLike-MIB
   for any interface where the DOT12-IF-MIB is implemented.

   RFC 2358 [RFC2358], RFC 2665 [RFC2665], and RFC xxxx [RFCxxxx] all
   contain updated versions of the EthernetLike-MIB.  They refer to RFC
   1643 in the context of explaining the history of the EthernetLike-

   MIB, and the citation in [RFCxxxx] is explicitly listed as a non-
   normative reference.

   RFC 2720 [RFC2720] contains the FLOW-METER-MIB.  It refers to RFC
   1643 only in an ASN.1 comment in the MIB module.  Omission of that
   comment would not preclude correct implementation of the MIB module.

   Clearly, none of these citations is normative.

3.  Security Considerations

   Reclassification of RFC 1643 will not, in and of itself, have any
   effect on the security of the Internet.
