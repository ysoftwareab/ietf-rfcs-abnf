Abstract

   This document describes a new Port Control Protocol (PCP) option
   called TUNNEL_ID.  It serves for identifying a Third Party in
   addition to the means that PCP's THIRD_PARTY option already provides
   for that purpose.

1.  Introduction

   The IETF has specified the Port Control Protocol (PCP) ([RFC6887]) to
   control how packets are translated and forwarded by a PCP-controlled
   device such as a network address translator (NAT) or firewall.

   This draft focuses on the application of PCP's THIRD_PARTY option
   that is used when the PCP client sends requests that concern other
   internal hosts than the host of the PCP client.  This is, for
   example, the case if port mapping requests for a carrier grade NAT
   (CGN) are not sent from PCP clients at the subscribers, but from a
   portal of the carrier at which subscribers can request port mappings.

   The issue addressed by the TUNNEL_ID option is that there are CGN
   deployments that do not distinguish internal hosts by their IP
   address only, but use further identifiers for unique subscriber
   identification.  This is, for example, the case if a CGN supports
   overlapping private IP address spaces according to [RFC1918] for
   internal hosts of different subscribers.  Then different internal
   hosts are identified and mapped at the CGN by their IP address and an
   additional ID, for example, the ID of a tunnel between the CGN and
   the subscriber.  In such cases, the IP address contained in the
   THIRD_PARTY option is not sufficient.  An additional identifier needs
   to be carried by the PCP protocol in order to uniquely identify the
   Internal Host.  The TUNNEL_ID option serves this purpose.

Internet-Draft                   PCP-ID                    February 2014


   The TUNNEL_ID option is defined for use in combination with the
   THIRD_PARTY option for the PCP opcodes MAP and PEER.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   The terminology defined in the specification of PCP [RFC6887]
   applies.

3.  Target Scenario

   This section illustrates the use of the TUNNEL_ID option in a
   scenario for a port mapping requests via a carrier portal.

   The scenario shown in Figure 1 has a carrier operating a CGN and a
   portal for subscribers to request port mappings at the CGN.  The
   portal communicates with the CGN using PCP.  For this purpose the
   portal is co-located with a PCP client and the CGN is co-located with
   a PCP server.  The way subscribers interact with the portal for
   requesting port mapping for their internal hosts is not specified in
   this scenario.

                       +----------------+
                       | Carrier        |    ==== IP packet tunnel(s)
                       | +------------+ |         between subscriber
   +--------------+    | | Subscriber | |         and CGN
   | Subscriber   +......+ Portal     | |    #### PCP communication
   |              |    | |            | |    .... Subscriber - portal
   |              |    | | PCP Client | |         interaction
   |              |    | +-----#------+ |         (unspecified)
   |              |    |       #        |
   |              |    | +-----#------+ |
   | +----------+ |    | | PCP Server | |
   | | Internal | |    | |            | |
   | | Host     +-+======+ CGN        +--------- Public Internet
   | +----------+ |    | +------------+ |
   +--------------+    +----------------+

            Figure 1: Carrier portal for port mapping requests

   The internal hosts use private IP addresses as specified in
   [RFC1918].  Since there is no NAT between the internal host and the
   CGN, there is an overlap of addresses used by internal hosts at
   different subscribers.  That is why the CGN needs more than just the

   internal host's IP address to distinguish internal hosts at different
   subscribers.  A commonly deployed method for solving this issue is
   using an additional identifiers for this purpose.  A very good
   candidate for this additional identifier at the CGN is the ID of the
   tunnel that connects the CGN to the subscriber's network.

   Requests for port mappings from the portal to the CGN need to
   uniquely identify the internal host for which a port mapping is to be
   established or modified.  Already existing for this purpose is the
   THIRD_PARTY option that can be used to specify the internal host's IP
   address.  The TUNNEL_ID option is introduced for carrying the
   additional (tunnel) information needed to identify the internal host
   in this scenario.

   The additional identifier for internal hosts needs to be included in
   MAP requests from the PCP client in order to uniquely identify the
   internal host that should have its address mapped.  This is the
   purpose that the new TUNNEL_ID serves in this scenario.  It carries
   the additional identifier, that is the tunnel ID, that serves for
   identifying an internal host in combination with the internal host's
   (private) IP address.  The IP address of the internal host is
   included in the PCP client's mapping requests by using the
   THIRD_PARTY option.

   The information carried by the TUNNEL_ID is not just needed to
   identify an internal host in a PCP request.  The CGN needs this
   information in its internal mapping tables for translating packet
   addresses and for forwarding packets to subscriber-specific tunnels.

   The TUNNEL_ID option is formatted as shown in Figure 2.

   o  Number: TBD

   o  Purpose: Identifies a request of an external IP address and port.

   o  Valid for opcodes: MAP, PEER, and all other for which the
      THIRD_PARTY option is valid for.

   o  Length: 16 octets

   o  May appear in: Request.  Must appear in response if it appeared in
      the associated request.

   o  Maximum occurrences: 1

   The fields are as follows:

   o  TUNNEL_ID: A vendor specific tunnel identifier that can be used to
      identify a subscriber's CGN session and the port ranges to apply
      this request to.

   The tunnel identifier field can contain any vendor specific value to
   identify a tunnel.  The option number is in the mandatory-to-process
   range (0-127), meaning that a request with a TUNNEL_ID option is
   executed by the PCP server if and only if the TUNNEL_ID option is
   supported by the PCP server.

5.  Behavior

   The following sections describe the operations of a PCP client and a
   PCP server when generating the request and processing the request and
   response.

5.1.  Generating a Request

   In addition to generating a PCP request that is described in
   [RFC6887] the following has to be applied.  The TUNNEL_ID option can
   be used together either with a PCP MAP or PEER opcode.  It MUST be
   used in combination with the THIRD_PARTY option which provides an IP
   address and port entered by the subscriber.  The TUNNEL_ID option
   holds the respective tunnel identifier to allow the CGN to uniquely
   identify the internal host (specified in the THIRD_PARTY option) for
   which the port mapping is to be established or modified.  If the
   tunnel identifier is shorter than 128 bits then the TUNNEL_ID option
   field is to be filled up with leading zeros up to 128 bits.

Internet-Draft                   PCP-ID                    February 2014


5.2.  Processing a Request

   The TUNNEL_ID option is in the mandatory-to-process range and if the
   PCP server does not support this option it MUST return an
   UNSUPP_OPTION response.  If the provided TUNNEL_ID is unknown/
   unavailable the PCP server MUST return a TUNNEL_ID_UNKNOWN response.

5.3.  Processing a Response

   If the PCP client receives a TUNNEL_ID_UNKNOWN response back for its
   previous request it SHOULD report an error message.  To where to
   report an error message is implementation dependent.

6.  Alternative

   An alternative to identify a tunnel affiliation in the given scenario
   could be using the DESCRIPTION ([I-D.ietf-pcp-description-option])
   option to carry a tunnel ID option.  The DESCRIPTION option is to
   allow a text description to be attached to a port mapping.  But using
   the DESCRIPTION option for a tunnel ID might not be appropriate
   because it specifies using UTF-8 and another requirement is that the
   description text must not be null terminated, which cannot always be
   met.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The following PCP Option Code is to be allocated in the mandatory-to-
   process range:

   TUNNEL_ID

   [NOTE for IANA: Please allocate a PCP Option Code at http://
   www.iana.org/assignments/pcp-parameters/pcp-parameters.xml#option-
   rules]

   The following PCP Result Code is to be allocated:

   TUNNEL_ID_UNKNOWN

   [NOTE for IANA: Please allocate a PCP Result Code at http://
   www.iana.org/assignments/pcp-parameters/pcp-parameters.xml#result-
   codes]

8.  Security Considerations

   As this option is related to the use of the THIRD_PARTY option the
   corresponding security considerations apply.  Especially, the network
   on which the PCP messages are sent must be fully trusted.
