 Locating Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Servers in a Dual-Stack IP
                                Network
                  draft-ietf-sipcore-dns-dual-stack-02

Abstract

   RFC 3263 defines how a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   implementation, given a SIP Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), should
   locate the next hop SIP server using Domain Name System (DNS)
   procedures.  As SIP networks increasingly transition from IPv4-only
   to dual-stack, a quality user experience must be ensured for dual-
   stack SIP implementations.  This document supplements the DNS
   procedures described in RFC 3263 for dual-stack SIP implementations
   and ensures that they properly align to the optimizations detailed by
   Happy Eyeballs.

1.  Introduction

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP, [RFC3261]) and the additional
   documents that extended the protocol assumed support for both IPv4
   and IPv6.  However, this support does not fully extend to the highly
   hybridized environments that are symptomatic of the transitional
   migratory phase from IPv4 to IPv6 networks.  During this phase, many
   server and client implementations run on dual-stack hosts.  In such
   environments, a dual-stack host will likely suffer greater connection
   delay, and by extension an inferior user experience, than an
   IPv4-only host.  The need to remedy this diminished performance of
   dual-stack hosts led to the development of the Happy Eyeballs
   [RFC6555] algorithm, which has since been implemented in many
   applications.

   This document aims to provide a complete design solution by
   clarifying the DNS lookup procedures of RFC 3263[RFC3263] to ensure
   enhanced performance, and consequently user experience, in highly
   hybridized dual-stack SIP networks.  The procedures described herein
   are such that a dual-stack client SHOULD look up both A and AAAA
   records in DNS and then select the best way to set up a network flow.

   The details of how the latter is done is considered out of scope for
   this document.  See the Happy Eyeballs algorithm and implementation
   and design considerations in RFC 6555 [RFC6555] for more information
   about issues with setting up dual-stack network flows.

   This document updates [RFC6157] as described in Section Section 5.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   RFC 3261 [RFC3261] defines additional terms used in this document
   that are specific to the SIP domain such as "proxy"; "registrar";
   "redirect server"; "user agent server" or "UAS"; "user agent client"
   or "UAC"; "back-to-back user agent" or "B2BUA"; "dialog";
   "transaction"; "server transaction".

   This document uses the term "SIP Server" that is defined to include
   the following SIP entities: user agent server, registrar, redirect
   server, a SIP proxy in the role of user agent server, and a B2BUA in
   the role of a user agent server.

   This document also uses the following terminology to make clear
   distinction between SIP entities supporting only IPv4, only IPv6 or
   supporting both IPv4 and IPv6.

   IPv4-only UA/UAC/UAS:  An IPv4-only UA/UAC/UAS supports SIP signaling
      and media only on the IPv4 network.  It does not understand IPv6
      addresses.

   IPv6-only UA/UAC/UAS:  An IPv6-only UA/UAC/UAS supports SIP signaling
      and media only on the IPv6 network.  It does not understand IPv4
      addresses.

   IPv4/IPv6 UA/UAC/UAS:  A UA/UAC/UAS that supports SIP signaling and
      media on both IPv4 and IPv6 networks; such a UA/UAC/UAS is known
      (and will be referred to in this document) as a "dual-stack"
      [RFC4213] UA/UAC/UAS.

4.  DNS Procedures in a Dual-Stack Network

   This specification introduces two normative DNS lookup procedures.
   These are designed to improve the performance of dual-stack clients
   in IPv4/IPv6 networks.

4.1.  Dual-Stack SIP UA DNS Record Lookup Procedure

   Once the transport protocol has been determined, the procedure for
   discovering an ip address if the TARGET is not a numeric IP address
   but the port is explicitly stated in the URI, is detailed in
   Section 4.2 of RFC 3263[RFC3263].  The piece relevant to to this
   discussion is:

      "If the TARGET was not a numeric IP address, but a port is present
      in the URI, the client performs an A or AAAA record lookup of the
      domain name.  The result will be a list of IP addresses, each of
      which can be contacted at the specific port from the URI and
      transport protocol determined previously."

   Section 4.2 of RFC 3263 [RFC3263] also goes on to describe the
   complete procedure for discovering an ip address if the TARGET is not
   a numeric IP address, and no port is present in the URI.  The piece
   relevant to to this discussion is:

      "If no SRV records were found, the client performs an A or AAAA
      record lookup of the domain name.  The result will be a list of IP
      addresses, each of which can be contacted using the transport
      protocol determined previously, at the default port for that
      transport.  Processing then proceeds as described above for an
      explicit port once the A or AAAA records have been looked up."

   Happy Eyeballs [RFC6555] has proven that looking up the "A or AAAA
   record" is not an effective practice for dual-stack clients and that
   it can add significant connection delay and greatly degrade user
   experience.  Therefore, this document makes the following normative
   addendum to the DNS lookup procedures of Section 4.2 of RFC 3263
   [RFC3263] for IPv4/IPv6 hybrid SIP networks and recommends it as a
   best practice for such dual-stack networks:

      The dual-stack client SHOULD perform an A and AAAA record lookup
      of the domain name and add the respective IPv4/IPv6 addresses to
      the list of IP addresses to be contacted.

4.2.  Indicating Address Family Preference in DNS SRV Records

   The Happy Eyeballs algorithm [RFC6555] is particularly effective when
   dual-stack client applications have significant performance
   differences in their IPv4 or IPv6 network paths.  In this common
   scenario it is often necessary for a dual-stack client to indicate a
   preference for either IPv4 or IPv6.  A service may use DNS SRV
   records to indicate such a preference for an address family.  This
   way, a server with a high-latency and/or low-capacity IPv4 tunnel may
   indicate a preference for being contacted using IPv6.  A server that

   wishes to do this can use the lowest SRV priority to publish
   hostnames that only resolve in IPv6 and the next priority with host
   names that resolve in both address families.

   When indicating address family preference through SRV, IPv4-only and/
   or IPv6-only clients should be prepared to handle SRV record sets
   that don't resolve into an ip address in the address family used by
   that client.  In such a case, the client should simply proceed to the
   next priority and try the hostnames in the alternate address family.

5.  Update to RFC 6157

   [RFC6157] defers to the Source and Destination Address Selection
   algorithms defined in [RFC6724] (the successor of [RFC3484]) when
   allowing a client to choose a specific server (c.f.  Section 5 in
   [RFC6157]).

   This document modifies the behavior of Section 5 in [RFC6157] to
   allow for an additional (and preferred) way to contact servers, as
   outlined in Section Section 4.2.  Implementations MUST use the DNS
   SRV records as described in Section Section 4.2 of this document
   first before resorting to the Source and Destination Address
   Selection algorithms defined in [RFC6724].

6.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces two new normative procedures to the existing
   DNS procedures used to locate SIP servers.  While both of these
   procedures are optimizations designed to improve the performance of
   dual-stack clients, neither introduces any new security
   considerations.

   The specific security vulnerabilities, attacks and threat models of
   the various protocols discussed in this document (SIP, DNS, SRV
   records, Happy Eyeballs requirements and algorithm, etc.) are well
   documented in their respective specifications.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any actions by IANA.
