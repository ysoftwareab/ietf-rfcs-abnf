                      draft-liu-lsr-p2poverlan-01

Abstract

   The point-to-point circuit type is one of the mainly used circuit
   types in link state routing protocol.  It is important to identify
   the correct circuit type when forming adjacencies, flooding link
   state database packets, and monitor the link state.  This document
   defines point-to-point interface type and relevant stack tables to
   provide benefit for operation, maintenance and statistics.

1.  Introduction

   Point-to-point is the predominant circuit type used by link state
   routing protocols such as IS-IS [RFC1195] and OSPF [RFC2328]
   [RFC5340].  Compare with broadcast interface, point-to-point
   interface is used differently when establish neighbor adjacencies,
   flood link state information, representing the topology, etc.

   To simplify configuration and operation, it is helpful To represent
   the fact that an interface is to be considered a point-to-point
   interface explicitly in the interface stack.  This enables, for
   example, routing protocols to automatically use the correct operating
   mode without further configuration.

   So it is necessary to abstract P2P as special sub-type type and
   define relevant interface stack table.  And if no entry saying
   p2pOverLan layer over ethernet, the management will suffer since lose
   the ability to get to the Ethernet-specific management properties
   (Ethernet MIB or YANG model) via many tools.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Relationship to the IF-MIB and Interfaces YANG Module

   As defined in [RFC8343], if the device implements the IF-MIB
   [RFC2863], each entry in the "/interfaces/interface" list in the
   operational state is typically mapped to one ifEntry.

Internet-Draft       IfStackTable for P2P interface            June 2021


   So P2P as sub-interface type should also fully map to one ifEntry,
   meanwhile define the "higher-layer-if" and "lower-layer-if" in the
   YANG corresponding to "ifStackTable" in IF-MIB to setup a complete
   interface stack table, then the P2P interface type can borrow all
   existing items in interfaces YANG and IF-MIB to take the full
   advantages from operation, statistic, etc.

   The "higher-layer-if" should be a network layer interface type, and
   the lower-layer-if should be a data link layer interface type.

Internet-Draft       IfStackTable for P2P interface            June 2021


4.  Interface Stack Table for P2P Interface Type

   P2P interface type is a kind of point-to-point circuit type.  P2P
   interface higher layer should be network layer "ipForward" (defined
   in IANA) to run routing protocol, P2P interface lower layer is link
   data layer "ethernetCsmacd" (defined in IANA).

   P2P interface type ifStackTable should be defined as the following
   example:

                    <interface>
                      <name>isis_int</name>
                      <type>ianaift:ipForward</type>
                    </interface>

                    <interface>
                      <name>eth1</name>
                      <type>ianaift:ethernetCsmacd</type>
                    </interface>

                    <interface>
                      <name>p2p</name>
                      <type>ianaift:p2pOverLan</type>
                      <higher-layer-if>isis_int</higher-layer-if>
                      <lower-layer-if>eth1</lower-layer-if>
                      <enabled>false</enabled>
                      <admin-status>down</admin-status>
                      <oper-status>down</oper-status>
                      <statistics>
                        <discontinuity-time>
                          2021-04-01T03:00:00+00:00
                        </discontinuity-time>
                        <!-- counters now shown here -->
                      </statistics>
                    </interface>

5.  Security Considerations

   The interface stack table specified in this document is read-only.
   Read operation to this table without complete protection shouldn't
   have a negative effect on network operations.

   The interface stack table defines to be accessed via network
   management protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241], RESTCONF [RFC8040].
   The NETCONF is over on layer secure transport, and the mandatory
   secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest

   RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is TLS [RFC8446].

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA need to update the "Interface Types(ifType)" registry (available
   at https://www.iana.org/assignments/smi-numbers/smi-
   numbers.xhtml#smi-numbers-5) with the following status types:

  +=========+==================+=======================================+
  | Decimal |    Name          |             Description               |
  +=========+==================+=======================================+
  |  303    |  p2pOverLan      |    Point to Point over LAN interface  |
  +---------+------------------+---------------------------------------+

                                 Figure 3

   IANA need to update the "IANAifType-MIB" registry (available at
   https://www.iana.org/assignments/ianaiftype-mib/ianaiftype-mib.xhtml)
   with the following status types:

  +=========+==================+=======================================+
  |  Value  |    Name          |               Description             |
  +=========+==================+=======================================+
  |  303    |  p2pOverLan      |  Point to Point over LAN interface    |
  +---------+------------------+---------------------------------------+

                                 Figure 4

   IANA need to update the "iana-if-type YANG Module" registry
   (available at https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-if-type/iana-if-
   type.xhtml) with the following status types:

                         identity p2pOverLan {
                           base iana-interface-type;
                           description
                             "Point to Point over LAN interface.";
                         }
