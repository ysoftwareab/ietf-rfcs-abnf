                      draft-chen-bier-pce-bier-00

Abstract

   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER)-TE shares architecture and
   packet formats with BIER as described in
   ([I-D.ietf-bier-architecture]).  BIER-TE forwards and replicates
   packets based on a BitString in the packet header, but every
   BitPosition of the BitString of a BIER-TE packet indicates one or
   more adjacencies.BIER-TE Path can be derived from a Path Computation
   Element (PCE).

   This document specifies extensions to the Path Computation Element
   Protocol (PCEP) to handle requests and responses for the computation
   of paths for BIER-TE.

1.  Introduction

   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER)-TE shares architecture and
   packet formats with BIER as described in
   ([I-D.ietf-bier-architecture]).  BIER-TE forwards and replicates
   packets based on a BitString in the packet header, but every

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119.

3.  Overview of PCEP Operation in BIER Networks

   BIER-TE forwards and replicates packets based on a BitString in the
   packet header.  In a PCEP session, An ERO object specified in
   [RFC5440] can be extended to carry a BIER-TE path consists of one or
   more BIER-ERO subobject(s).  BIER-TE computed by a PCE can be
   represented in the following forms:

   o  An ordered set of adjacencies BitString(s) in which each bit
      represents that the adjacencies to which the BFR should replicate
      packets to in the domain.

   In this document, we define a set of PCEP protocol extensions,
   including a new PCEP capability,a new Path Setup Type (PST) ,a new
   BIER END-POINT Object, new ERO subobjects, new RRO subobjects, new
   PCEP error codes and procedures.

4.  BIER PCEP Message Extensions

   The following section describes the protocol extensions required to
   support BIER-TE path.

4.1.  BIER Capability Advertisement

4.1.1.  The OPEN Object

   This document defines a new optional TLV for use in the OPEN Object.

4.1.1.1.  The BIER PCE Capability TLV

   The BIER-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV is an optional TLV associated with the
   OPEN Object to exchange BIER capability of PCEP speakers.  The format
   of the BIER-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV is shown in the following figure:

       |         Reserved              |         Flags                 |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+



                                 Figure 1

   The code point for the TLV type is to be defined by IANA.

   Length: 4 bytes

   The "Reserved" (2 octet) and "Flags" (2 octet) fields are currently
   unused, and MUST be set to zero on transmission and ignored on
   reception.

4.1.1.1.1.  Exchanging BIER Capability

   This document defines a new optional BIER-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV for use
   in the OPEN object to negotiate the BIER capability.  The inclusion
   of this TLV in the OPEN message destined to a PCC indicates the PCE's
   capability to perform BIER-TE path computations, and the inclusion of
   this TLV in the OPEN message destined to a PCE indicates the PCC's
   capability to support BIER-TE Path.

   A PCE that is able to support the BIER extensions defined in this
   document SHOULD include the BIER-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV on the OPEN
   message.  If the PCE does not include the BIER-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV in
   the OPEN message and PCC does include the TLV, it is RECOMMENDED that
   the PCC indicates a mismatch of capabilities.

4.2.  Path Computation Request/Reply Message Extensions

4.2.1.  The RP/SPR Object

   In order to setup an BIER-TE, a new PATH-SETUP-TYPE
   TLV([I-D.ietf-pce-lsp-setup-type]) MUST be contained in RP or SRP
   object.  This document defines a new Path Setup Type (PST) for BIER
   as follows:

   o  PST = 2: Path is setup using BIER Traffic Engineering technique.

   If a PCEP speaker does not recognize the PATH-SETUP-TYPE TLV, it MUST
   ignore the TLV in accordance with [RFC5440].  If a PCEP speaker

Internet-Draft              PCEP Ext for BIER              December 2015


   recognizes the TLV but does not support the TLV, it MUST send PCErr
   with Error-Type = 2 (Capability not supported).

4.2.2.  The New BIER END-POINT Object

   The END-POINTS object is used in a PCReq message to specify the BIER
   information of the path for which a path computation is requested.
   To represent the end points for a BIER path efficiently, we define a
   new END-POINT Object for the BIER path:

   The format of the new END-POINTS Object is as follows:


                         0                   1
                         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5

                        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Subdomain-id: Unique value identifying the BIER sub-domain. 1 octet

   BS Length: A 1 octet field encoding the supported BitString length.

   Source BFR-id:A 2 octet field encoding the source BFR-id.

   Destniation BFR-id:A 2 octet field encoding the destniation BFR-id.

4.2.3.  ERO Object

   BIER-TE consists of one or more adjacencies BitStrings where every
   BitPosition of the BitString indicates one or more adjacencies, as
   described in([I-D.eckert-bier-te-arch]).

   The ERO object specified in [RFC5440] is used to encode the path of a
   TE LSP through the network.The ERO is carried within a PCRep message
   to provide the computed TE LSP if the path computation was
   successful.In order to carry BIER-TE explicit paths, this document

   defines a new ERO subobjects referred to as "BIER-ERO subobjects"
   whose formats are specified in the following section.  An BIER-ERO
   subobjects carrying a adjacencies BitStrings consists of one or more
   BIER-ERO subobject(s).

                                 Figure 3

   Type: TBD

   Length: 4 bytes

   BS Length: A 1 octet field encoding the supported BitString length.

   The "Reserved" (1 octets) fields are currently unused, and MUST be
   set to zero on transmission and ignored on reception.

   Adjacency BitString: A 4 octet field encoding the Adjacency BitString
   where every BitPosition of the BitString indicates one or more
   adjacencies.

4.2.3.1.1.  BIER-ERO Processing

   If a PCC finds a non-recognize the BIER-ERO subobject, the PCC MUST
   respond with a PCErr message with Error-Type=3 ("Unknown Object") and
   Error-Value=2 ("Unrecognized object Type") or Error-Type=4 ("Not
   supported object") and Error-Value=2 ("Not supported object Type") as
   described in [RFC5440] .

   If a PCC receives an BIER-ERO subobject in which either
   BitStringLength or Adjacency BitString is absent, it MUST consider
   the entire BIER-ERO subobject invalid and send a PCErr message with
   Error-Type = 10 ("Reception of an invalid object") and Error-Value =
   TBD ("BitStringLength is absent ") and Error-Value = TBD ("Adjacency
   BitString is absent ")

Internet-Draft              PCEP Ext for BIER              December 2015


   If a PCC detects that all subobjects of BIER-ERO are not identical,
   it MUST send a PCErr message with Error-Type = 10 ("Reception of an
   invalid object") and Error-Value = TBD ("Non-identical BIER-ERO
   subobjects").

   If a PCC receives an BIER-ERO subobject in which BitStringLength
   values are not chosen from: 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, and 4096,
   as it described in ([I-D.ietf-bier-architecture]).  The PCC MUST send
   a PCErr message with Error-Type = 10 ("Reception of an invalid
   object") and Error-Value = TBD ("Invalid BitStringLength").

4.2.4.  RRO Object

   A PCC can record BIER-ERO explicit paths and report the paths to a
   PCE via RRO.  An RRO object contains one or more subobjects called
   "BIER-RRO subobjects" whose formats are the same as that of BIER-ERO
   subobject.

4.2.4.1.  RRO Processing

   Processing rules of BIER-RRO subobject are identical to those of
   BIER-ERO subobject defined in section 4.2.3.1 in this document.

5.  Security Considerations

   TBD.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  PCEP Objects

   As discussed in Section 4.2.2, a new END-POINTS Object-Type is
   defined.  IANA has made the following Object-Type allocations from
   the "PCEP Objects" sub-registry:

                Object                          Object-Class Value
          ---------------------               --------------------------
            BIER END-POINT Object                      TBD


   As discussed in Section 4.2.3 and 4.2.4, a new sub-object type for
   the PCEP explicit route object (ERO), and a new sub-object type for
   the PCEP record route object (RRO) are defined.

   IANA has made the following sub-objects allocation from the RSVP
   Parameters registry:
