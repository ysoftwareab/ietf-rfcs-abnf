Internet-Draft        Reassignment of System Ports           August 2017


1.  Introduction

   RFC 6335 [RFC6335] requires System Ports, also known as the Well
   Known Ports, in the range from 0 to 1023, to be assigned by the "IETF
   Review" or "IESG Approval" procedures [RFC5226].  Further, for
   assignments done through RFCs published via the "IETF Document
   Stream" [RFC4844], the Assignee will be the IESG with the IETF Chair
   as the Contact.  Therefore, all System Ports must be assigned to the
   IESG.

   However, ports that were assigned before the publication of RFC 6335,
   are often assigned to individuals, even if they are part of the
   System Port range.  Besides the fact that System Ports that are
   widely used by IETF protocols under IETF change control, this is
   especially problematic if the assignment is or should be changed.
   The Assignee, can change the assignment without confirmation of the
   IETF.  However, if the IETF process requires a change, including
   deassignment, this cannot be done without the agreement of the
   original Assignee.  Furthermore, no procedure is defined to change
   the assignment in cases where the original Assignee is not reachable
   or for any other reason not available anymore,

   This document instructs IANA to re-assign all currently assigned
   System Ports in the range from 0 to 1023 to the IESG, thus aligning
   existing entries in the "Service Name and Transport Protocol Port
   Number Registry" with the current procedures defined in RFC 6335.

2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA [will re-assign/has reassigned] all System Ports in the port
   range from 0 to 1023 that are currently assigned in the "Service Name
   and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry" to the IESG
   <iesg@ietf.org> as Asignee and the IETF Chair <chair@ietf.org> as
   Contact.

   IANA should inform the current Assignees by email with the registered
   email address about this change.  However, IANA does not need to take
   any actions to inform the current Assignee if the provided email
   address in not valid anymore, or the Assignee is not reachable
   anymore with the provided email address.

   As part of this change IANA [will also upadte/has further updated]
   the Reference column with the following reference for the listed
   ports that have a corresponding published RFC that uses this port
   number, as well as the Assignment Notes column for historic RFCs:
