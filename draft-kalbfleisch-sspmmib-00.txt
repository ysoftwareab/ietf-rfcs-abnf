Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring Synthetic Sources
   for Performance Monitoring algorithms (SSPM).

   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both compliant
   to the SMIv2, and semantically identical to the peer SMIv1
   definitions.

   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines a method of sorting the interfaces of a
   monitored device according to values of parameters specific to this
   interface.

   This memo also includes a MIB module.  This MIB module extends the
   list of managed objects specified in [17] and [18].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [20].

2.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [1].

   o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
       purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
       Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
       RFC 1155 [2], RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The second version,
       called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5], RFC 1903 [6] and RFC
       1904 [7].

   o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
       first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
       described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message
       protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
       called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
       The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and
       described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11] and RFC 2274 [12].

   o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
       first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
       described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations
       and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

   o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and
       the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275
       [15].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are

INTERNET DRAFT                  SSPM MIB                       July 2000


   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED","MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [16].

3. Overview

   This document defines a MIB for the purpose of remotely controlling
   synthetic sources (or 'active' probes) and sinks for the purpose of
   enhancing remote performance monitoring capabilities within IP
   networks and services.  Much work within the IETF exists related to
   performance monitoring.  One interesting aspect of this body of work
   is that it does not explicitly define an 'active' probe capability.
   An active probe capability is complimentary to existing capabilities,
   and this MIB is developed to fill this void.  The utility of this
   function within the Internet and the relationship of this MIB to
   other working group activities is discussed in a framework document
   [<draft-cole-sspm-00.txt>].

   The rperfman BOF in Adelaide in March of 2000 was held to discuss the
   possibility of developing a standard set of synthetic probes for
   performance management functions.  It was agreed at that time to move
   forward with the development of this MIB and that this work would be
   sponsored within the RMONMIB WG.  For more information on the outcome
   of this BOF, refer to the meeting minutes [rperfmanBOF minutes by
   Bierman].

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

      + 'Performance monitoring' is the act of monitoring traffic for
      the purpose of evaluating a statistic of a metric related to the
      performance of the system.  A performance monitoring system is
      comprised of a) traffic generators, b) measurement, c) data
      reduction, and d) reporting.  The traffic generators may be
      natural sources, synthetic sources or intrusive sources
      [appmcapsMIB].

INTERNET DRAFT                  SSPM MIB                       July 2000


      + A 'synthetic source' is a device or an embedded software program
      which generates a data packet (or packets) and injects it (them)
      onto the path to a corresponding probe or existing server solely
      in support of a performance monitoring function.  A synthetic
      source may talk intrusively to existing application servers.

   The design goals for this MIB are:

      + Compliment the overall performance management architecture being
      defined within the RMONMIB WG - this MIB is defined within the
      context of the appmcapsMIB.

      + Extensibility - the MIB should be easily extended to include a
      greater set of protocols and applications for performance
      monitoring purposes.

      + Flexible - it should support both round trip and one way
      measurements.

      + Security - the control of the source and sink of traffic is
      handled by a management application and communication is
      recommended via SNMPv3.

   This document is organized as follows.  The next section discusses
   the relationship of this MIB to other MIBs from the RMONMIB and
   DISMAN working groups.  Then the structure of the MIB is discussed.
   Finally, the MIB definitions are given.

4. Relationship to other MIBs The objects defined in this MIB extend
   those defined in the Performance Measurement Capabilities MIB. That
   MIB defines capabilities for measurements. Two other MIBs,
   Application Performance Measurement MIB and Application Performance
   Measurement Framework Transport Performance
    Metrics MIB, define reporting capabilities for that framework. The
   intent of this MIB is to define a method for injecting packets into
   the network utilizing probe capabilities defined in the base MIBs and
   measured with the reporting MIBs.

5. MIB Structure This section presents the structure of the MIB. The
   objects are arranged into the following groups:

   o   general information

   o   source configuration

   o   link layer extentions

   o   application layer extentions

INTERNET DRAFT                  SSPM MIB                       July 2000


   o   sink configuration

   o   history information

5.1.  general information This section provides general information
   about the capabilities of the probe. Currently this information is
   related to the resolution of the probe clock and its source.

   5.2.  source configuration This MIB takes an IP centric view of the
   configuration of the measurement.  The source table provides
   configuration information for the IP layer portions of the
   measurements.

   5.3.  link layer extentions The link layer extentions table allows
   configuration of link layer attributes within the test.

   5.4.  application layer extentions The application layer extentions
   provides the ability to provide the configuration of application
   layer attributes.

   5.5.  sink configuration Currently the MIB is defined such that
   source configures one way source and round trip measurements. In the
   case of one way tests the sink configures the ability to receive a
   particular measurement. It may be desireable to modify the structure
   of the MIB such that there is a sink entry even on the originating
   probe for round trip measurements. See the issues section for more
   information.

   5.6.  history information This section of the MIB defines some
   configuration attributes to control the size of the history table and
   what happens when the table is full. The table is intended to provide
   information about the raw data of the tests from when then
   measurements were made. It is not intended as the general purpose
   reporting function. That function is to be provided by the before
   mentioned MIBs.

9.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB
   that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
   Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
   network environments.  The support for SET operations in a
   non-secure environment without proper protection can have a
   negative effect on network operations.

   The nature of the MIB is that it defines objects to allow packets
   to be injected into the network for the purpose of measuring some
   performance characteristics. There are some attributes which allow
   specifically configuring various fields in Link and IP layer packets.

   There are some attributes which configure username and password
   information for some application level protocols. Access to these
   attributes may provide unauthorized use of resources.

INTERNET DRAFT                  SSPM MIB                       July 2000


   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects
   and possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when
   sending them over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of
   SNMP provide features for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the
   network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed
   to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in
   this MIB.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the
   use of the User-based Security Model RFC 2274 [12] and the
   View-based Access Control Model RFC 2275 [15] is RECOMMENDED.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those
   principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or
   SET (change/create/delete) them.

11. Issues

   This section will ultimately be removed from the document. It
   captures a list of open issues that need to be resolved as this document
   is discussed.

   Add RFC 2851 to references for INET-ADDRESS-MIB

   Add RFC 2863 to references for IF-MIB

   Should sspmClockSource define various levels of ntp resolution?

   Should the packet fill for URL fail if the probe does not support that
   ability?

   sspmApplLayerExtentionParameter - We also discussed deleteing this
attribute
   and instead describing how one might define such an
   attribute in a private extention in the appendix of this

   ID.

   Determine proper indexing for sspmSinkTable

   Should start/end times be specified? Or should these be left to the
   NMS and or implementation of the schedule/script MIBs to set the
   control bit on/off.

   start time - time to start some test. Controlled by the control object
      to enable

   end time - when test ends. Purhaps duration is a better term

   repeat time - for configuing test which run once per hour, day, week,
etc.
      Purhaps this can/should be done with the DISMAN shedule MIB.

   Should Appl Layer Parameter be defined. Could need to set more attributes
   for this. One option is a follow on MIB say for HTTP to set header
values,
   etc.

   How should the sink be addressed. Currently it is intended that rows
   in the sink table are instantiated on the receiving side of a one way
   delay measurement. It may make better sense to have a source and sink
   even for round trip measurements. Then the only difference is whether
   the sink is on the same machine as the source.

   This was is a reference to a performance monitoring protocol.
   (  http://telesto.advanced.org/~kalidindi/STR/owdp.html  ).
   Need to consider if the constructs described can be implemented
   with this MIB.


   Need to flush out conformance and compliance.
