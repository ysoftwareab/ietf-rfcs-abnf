        other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-
        Drafts. 

        Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months 
        and may be updated, replaced, or made obsolete by other documents at 
        any time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference

     Abstract 

        This memo describes the requirements of Internet-Drafts proposing 
        changes to the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 (DHCPv4).  
        These requirements specifically cover documentation expected whenever 
        message formats or client state transitions are modified.

     Internet Draft        DHCPv4 Change Requirements        December 2003 
      

     1. Introduction 

        During the lifetime to date of the Dynamic Host Configuration 
        Protocol (DHCPv4) it has been the subject of 30 Requests for Comments 
        (RFCs) regarding the base protocol, 5 of which added new DHCP message 
        types or extended the protocol in some way, and 18 RFCs concerning 
        other DHCP options.  Seven RFCs covered procedures and definition of 
        base options.  Additionally, there are constantly a number of 
        Internet-Drafts under consideration for DHCP. 

        There has been no standard documentation required to date for new 
        Internet-Drafts concerning DHCP, even when proposed changes altered 
        message formats, the client state machine, or processing required of 
        servers, relay agents, or clients. 

        This memo proposes a common-sense minimum standard for documentation 
        required in any new Internet-Draft that will ensure consistency among 
        the various IETF documents and improve the clarity of proposed 
        changes. 

        The key words "MUST," "MUST NOT," "REQUIRED," "SHALL," "SHALL NOT," 
        "SHOULD," "SHOULD NOT," "RECOMMENDED,"  "MAY," and "OPTIONAL" in this 
        document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. 


     2. Minimum Documentation Requirements 

        It SHALL be the policy of the Dynamic Host Configuration (DHC) 
        Working Group that new Internet-Drafts concerning DHCPv4 conform to 
        each of the following requirements: 


     2.1. Description of Message Format Changes 

        An Internet-Draft that proposes any changes to the DHCPv4 message 
        format MUST fully describe the proposed change, and MUST modify or 
        add entries to the message format figures and message requirements 
        tables as appropriate.  These include: 

       o  RFC 2131, Figure 1, "Format of a DHCP message" 

       o  RFC 2131, Figure 2, "Format of the 'flags' field" 

       o  RFC 2131, Table 1, "Description of fields in a DHCP message" 

       o  RFC 2131, Table 2, "DHCP Messages" 

       o  RFC 2131, Table 3, "Fields and options used by DHCP servers"

     Internet Draft        DHCPv4 Change Requirements        December 2003 
      
       o  RFC 2131, Table 4, "Client messages from different states" 

       o  RFC 2131, Table 5, "Fields and options used by DHCP clients" 

        Figures and tables appearing in other, relevant RFCs MUST also be 
        updated as appropriate. 


     2.2. Description of Client State Machine Changes 

        An Internet-Draft that proposes changes to the DHCP client state 
        machine MUST supply an updated version of the client state transition 
        diagram (RFC 2131, Figure 5) showing event triggers, states, and 
        client actions.  State transition diagrams appearing in other, 
        relevant RFCs MUST also be updated as appropriate. 


     2.3. Description of Behavior Changes 

        An Internet-Draft that proposes changes to the behavior of DHCP 
        servers, clients, or relay agents MUST supply an updated description 
        of the modified behavior.  For example, see RFC 2131, Sections 4.3 
        and 4.4, for the description of DHCP server and client behavior, 
        respectively.  Relay Agent behavior is described [as "gateway"] in 
        RFC 951. 


     3. Intellectual Property 

        The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any 
        intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to 
        pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in 
        this document or the extent to which any license under such rights 
        might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it 
        has made any effort to identify any such rights.  Information on the 
        IETF's procedures with respect to rights in standards-track and 
        standards-related documentation can be found in BCP-11. 

        Copies of claims of rights made available for publication and any 
        assurances of licenses to be made available, or the result of an 
        attempt made to obtain a general license or permission for the use of 
        such proprietary rights by implementers or users of this 
        specification can be obtained from the IETF Secretariat. 

        The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any 
        copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary 
        rights that may cover technology that may be required to practice 
        this standard.  Please address the information to the IETF Executive 
        Director.
