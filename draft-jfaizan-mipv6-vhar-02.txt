Abstract

   Current specifications of Mobile IPv6 does not provide Home Agent 
   Reliability in the home link. The aim of this draft is to introduce 
   Virtual Home Agent Reliability Protocol as the solution. In this 
   protocol multiple Home Agents coexist on the same home link and share 
   the same Global IP address. Only one of them is active at a time and 
   serves the Mobile Node. The Home Agent failure and failover 
   mechanisms are completely transparent to the Mobile Node which is 
   required for minimal service interruption time. This protocol does 
   not introduce any new Mobile IPv6 message over the air interface and 
   thus helps reducing the overall overhead.

1. Introduction

   Mobile IPv6 [1] is designed to allow a Mobile Node(MN) to change its 
   point of IP subnet attachment in the Internet at the network or IP 
   layer. MN is always identified by it Home Address regardless of its 
   current location. Its mobility is not limited by conventional IP 
   network boundaries. In Mobile IPv6 system the Home Agent(HA) remains 
   at conventional IPv6 subnet called the home link and when the MN is 
   at the home link packets sent to it are routed through conventional 
   IPv6 [3] routing mechanisms. When the MN is not at home link it 
   registers its remote point of attachment address called Care-of 
   Address with the HA. This allows HA to forward packets, addressed to 
   the MN at its home link, to its current location. 
   
   In Mobile IPv6 system, as currently specified, a single HA services 
   multiple MNs. Mobile IPv6 also allows deployment of multiple HAs on 
   the same link so that if the serving HA fails then any other HA 
   on the link can provide service to the MN. 
   
   In Mobile IPv6, MN registers and establishes a connection with only 
   one HA. The MN is reliant on this HA for its connectivity. Thus the 
   HA represents the possibility of a single point of failure for Mobile 
   IPv6. A HA may be responsible for multiple MNs on the home link. The 
   failure of a single HA may then result in the loss of connectivity 
   for numerous MNs located throughout the Internet. Thus the HA and MN 
   taken together have a shared fate. A MN cannot afford the loss of its 
   HA. To overcome this problem Mobile IPv6 allows deployment of 
   multiple HAs on the home link so that upon the failure of serving HA, 
   another HA can take over the functions of failed HA and thus provide 
   continuous service to the MN(s) registered with failed HA. This 
   transfer of service from the failed HA to a new working HA is 
   problematic and the current specification of Mobile IPv6 does not 
   provide solution to these problems. In [7] these problems were 
   discussed and guidelines for the possible solutions were proposed.
   
   The goal of this draft is to propose "Virtual Home Agent Reliability"
   protocol which provides HA Reliability in the Mobile IPv6 networks.

   Mobile IPv6
           Mobile IP for IPv6 [1]

   Mobile Node (MN)
           A node that can change its point of attachment from one link 
           to another, while still being reachable via its home address. 

   IP
           Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6).[3]

   Home Address
           A unicast routable address assigned to a MN, used as the 
           permanent address of the MN. This address is within the MN's 
           home link. Standard IP routing mechanisms will deliver 
           packets destined for a MN's home address to its home 
           link. MNs can have multiple home addresses, for instance when 
           there are multiple home prefixes on the home link.

   Home Link
           The link on which a MN's home subnet prefix is defined.
 
   Home Agent (HA)
           A router on a MN's home link with which the MN has registered 
           its current Care-of address. While the MN is away from home, 
           the HA intercepts packets on the home link destined to the 
           MN's home address, encapsulates them, and tunnels them to the 
           MN's registered Care-of address.

   Care-of Address
           A unicast routable address associated with a MN while
           visiting a foreign link; the subnet prefix of this IP address 
           is a foreign subnet prefix. Among the multiple 
           Care-of addresses that a MN may have at any given time (e.g.,
           with different subnet prefixes), the one registered with the 
           MN's HA for a given home address is called its "primary"
           Care-of address.

   IPsec Security Association
           An IPsec security association is a cooperative relationship 
           formed by the sharing of cryptographic keying material and 
           associated context. Security associations are simplex. That 
           is, two security associations are needed to protect 
           bidirectional traffic between two nodes, one for each 
           direction. 

   Home Registration
           A registration between the MN and its HA, authorized by the 
           use of IPsec.

3. Related Work

   HAHA [4] protocol provides HA Reliability for Mobile IPv6. In this 
   protocol multiple HAs are provided over different links and MN has to 
   register its binding in them. MN selects one of the HAs as its 
   primary HA. Primary HA or any other HA can tunnel packets from 
   Correspondant Node to MN. On failure of the primary HA the MN can 
   switch its service to any other HA on any link. In this protocol the 
   MN has burden to detect the failure of its primary HA and then 
   recover from this failure. Since HAs are located at different 
   physical links to provide service in case of home link failure the MN 
   has burden of doing multiple Home Registrations. Also the failure of 
   the primary HA is not transparent to the MN and it is delayed by a 
   considerable amount of time which results in service interruption and 
   message overhead. MN also has to re-establish IPsec Security 
   Associations (SAs) with all the HAs. 


4. Virtual Home Agent Reliability Protocol Overview

   Virtual HA Reliability Protocol (VHAR) provides HA reliability in the 
   Mobile IPv6 by introducing some modifications in the operation of 
   HAs. Except some modifications, the Mobile IPv6 operation remains 
   unchanged. VHAR uses multiple HAs on the same home link. All the HAs 
   have different link-local IP addresses but exactly same Global IP 
   address, referred as Global Home Agent address (modification in 
   Mobile IPv6). Unlike Mobile IPv6, MN is only aware of the Global Home 
   Agent address and uses this address as the destination IP address for 
   the packets destined to its home network. Also the HA send packets to 
   the MN using the Global Home Agent address as the source IP address. 
   In short all the communication between the MN and HA is based on the 
   Global Home Agent address. This provide seamless HA failure and 
   failover and helps keeping the message overhead and service 
   interruption time minimized. On the home link all the HAs communicate 
   with each other using link-local IP addresses according to normal 
   Mobile IPv6 operation.
      
4.1 VHAR Deployment Scenario
   
   We will consider a basic deployment scenario where six HAs (HA_1..6) 
   coexist on the same home link to provide continuous service to the 
   MN. Currently HA_1 is Active HA and responsible for all the Mobile 
   IPv6 HA functions.

4.2 VHAR State Diagram

   Unlike Mobile IPv6, each HA on the link could be in one of the 
   following states.
   
Active HA
   
	Active HA is the one which is responsible for all the Mobile 
	IPv6 HA tasks. It owns the Global Home Agent address. There 
	could be only one Active HA on the link at a particular instance 
	of time. When any HA becomes Active HA it multicasts Neighbor 
	Advertisement message on the link with the Target address equal 
	to Global Home Agent address and Target link layer address equal 
	to its own link-local IP address. This way the Active HA inform 
	all the nodes on the link that the Global Home Agent address is 
	owned by it. As the result packets received by any node with the 
	destination IP address equal to that of Global Home Agent 
	address will be forwarded to the Active HA. The Active HA will 
	send Router Advertisements on the link by setting 'A' bit along 
	with the 'H' bit.
	
Backup HA
   
	There are atleast two HAs always exist on the link serving as 
	the backup for the mobility bindings. They are known as Backup 
	HAs. They don't perform any HA operation and serves as the IPv6 
	router. Upon the Active HA failure one of the available Backup 
	HAs will become Active HA. Each Backup HA will send Router 
	Advertisements on the link by setting 'B' bit along with the 'H'  
	bit.

Inactive HA
   
        Inactive HA is the one which is working as IPv6 router and not 
        performing any HA task. Initially all HAs are Inactive HAs. 
        Later on except the Active HA and Backup HAs all other HAs on 
        the link are Inactive HAs. An Inactive HA can be changed to 
        Backup HA by the Active HA. They send Router Advertisements on 
        the link by setting the 'H' bit.

4.3 Mobile Node Registration

   When MN wants to register its Care-of Address, it sends Binding 
   Update (BU) using the Global Home Agent address as the destination 
   address. Any node intercepting this BU will check its neighbor cache 
   [5] and forward it to the Active HA_1 (in our scenario) which MAY 
   perform Duplicate Address Detection [5] (DaD) to know if the sending 
   MN is already registered with any other HA on the home link. If it is 
   registered then the Active HA_1 will send "MN Release Request" 
   message to the HA which is holding the binding. In response, "MN 
   Release Reply" message will be send to the Active HA_1 which will 
   complete the registration according to normal Mobile IPv6 operation.
   Active HA_1 will then select two HAs, HA_4 and HA_5 on the link and 
   send "MN Context Update Request"(MCUR) messages to them. In response 
   these HAs will become Backup HAs and send "MN Context Update Reply" 
   (MCURe) messages to the Active HA_1. If the Backup HAs already exist 
   then the Active HA_1 will send MCUR messages to them directly. Upon 
   receiving the replies Active HA_1 will send Binding Acknowledgement 
   (BA) message to the MN.as shown in figure 3 and figure 4..

             Figure 4: VHAR Mobile Node Registration Signal Flow
             
   The above mentioned signal flow indicates that there is only single 
   Home Registration done by the MN on the home link and still MN's 
   binding information is stored on three HAs.

4.4 VHAR Failure Detection and Recovery 

   According to Mobile IPv6 specifications each HA maintains Home Agent 
   List(HAL) to keep track of all the HAs on the link. VHAR modifies 
   this HAL by adding a new field called "Status". This Status field 
   represents the state of the HA which could be Active, Backup or 
   Inactive. Unsolicited multicast Router Advertisement messages are 
   sent periodically on the link according to Mobile IPv6. They help 
   HAs to maintain their HALs. VHAR modifies the Router Advertisement 
   message by including two flag bits called the 'A' bit (Active HA) and 
   the 'B' bit (Backup HA). Also currently specified 'H' bit indicates 
   Inactive HA. Thus each HA on the link knows about the Active HA, 
   Backup HAs and Inactive HAs on the home link.

   When any HA on the link fails all other HAs will not receive Router 
   Advertisement messages from it and upon timeout they will send

   unicast Router Solicitation messages [5] to it in order to confirm 
   its failure and if they don't receive Router Advertisement message 
   from it still, they will delete its entry from their HALs.  

4.4.1 Active Home Agent Failure

   If the failed HA is Active HA then one of the two Backup HAs will 
   become Active HA and it will start sending Router Advertisements with 
   the 'A' bit set along with the 'H' bit. It will make, among the 
   Inactive HAs, a Backup HA by sending MCUR message and receiving MCURe 
   message in response. 
   
   Figure 5 shows the failure of Active HA_1 which results in changing 
   the status of Backup HA_4 into Active HA_4. The Active HA_4 will then 
   send MCUR message to the Inactive HA_2 in order to make it as Backup 
   HA_2 as shown in figure 6

4.4.2 Backup Home Agent Failure

   VHAR require atleast two Backup HAs always maintained on the home 
   link. It is unlikely that the both Backup HAs fail at the same time. 
   There could be more than two Backup HAs but it depends on the 
   application requirement.
   
   If the failed HA is Backup HA then the Active HA will make an
   Inactive HA as another Backup HA by sending MCUR message to it and 
   receiving MCURe message in response. This newly added Backup HA will 
   then start sending Router Advertisements by setting the 'B' bit along 
   with the 'H' bit.
   
   Figure 8 shows the failure of Backup HA_5 as the result of which 
   Active HA_4 sends MCUR message to Inactive HA_6 in order to make it 
   as Backup HA_6 as shown in figure 9

   The Signal flows shown above indicate that the failure detection and 
   recovery mechanism are completely transparent to the MN which is 
   required to keep the service interruption time minimal. Moreover 
   there is no operational burden on the MN. All the messages are 
   exchanged on the home link only. This also helps reducing the message 
   overhead on the air interface.
   

5. Security Issues in VHAR

5.1 IPsec SAs Synchronization among Home Agents

   As discussed in the HA reliability problem statement draft [7], 
   re-establishment of IPsec SAs between the MN and the new HA after the 
   failure of MN's serving HA is problematic. To encounter this problem,
   VHAR does not involve MN in this re-establishment of IPsec SAs at 
   all. This is possible by synchronizing the existing IPsec SAs with 
   the Backup HAs on the link. 
   
   VHAR requires that initially IPsec SAs are always established 
   dynamically or manually configured in the Active HA which will 
   synchronize with the Backup HAs. Active HA will send SP Synch message 
   to the Backup HAs when a new IPsec SA gets established dynamically or 
   manually configured or any parameter, except Sequence Number Counter 
   and Anti-reply Window, gets updated or a new Backup HA is assigned by 
   it as shown in figure 11. The SP Synch message is acknowledged with 
   SP Reply message. When the Sequence Number and Anti-Reply Window 
   parameters are changed in the SA Database (SAD) then the Active HA 
   will send SeqNo Synch message two times to the Backup HAs. This    
   message is not acknowledged. This is done to minimize the traffic 
   flow.
   .   
5.2 Correct Ordering of Binding Updates

   During the Home Registration process, the Active HA send MCUR 
   messages to the Backup HAs which contain complete mobility binding 
   information including the sequence number. This helps keeping the 
   sequence number information of binding updates protected in case of 
   Active HA failure and solves the correct ordering problem.

6. New ICMP Messages
   
6.1 Modified Router Advertisement Message

   The Router Advertisement messages as defined in Mobile IPv6 are sent 
   among HAs to maintain their HALs. The Source and Destination address 
   fields of the IPv6 header MUST be set to sender's link-local unicast 
   address and multicast address respectively.

   VHAR modifies the format of the Router Advertisement message by the 
   addition of two flag bits to indicate the status of sending HA. Also 
   the Reserved field is changed. Router Advertisement message is as 
   follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   This format represents the following changes over the Router 
   Advertisement message defined in Mobile IPv6 [1]

   Active HA bit (A)

           The Active HA bit (A) is set to indicate that the sender of 
           this message is functioning as Active HA on the link.

   Backup HA bit (B)

           The Backup HA bit (B) is set to indicate that the sender of 
           this message is functioning as Backup HA on the link.
           
   Reserved (Reser)

           Reduced from a 5-bit field to a 3-bit field to account for 
           the addition of the above bits.

6.2 MN Release Request Message

   The MN Release Request message is sent by the Active HA to another HA 
   at which MN is currently registered. The purpose of this message is 
   to request de-registration of the MN's binding at its current HA. The 
   Source and Destination address fields of the IPv6 header MUST be set 
   to sender's and receiver's unicast link-local addresses.

   Reserved

           This field is unused. It MUST be initialized to zero by the 
           sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

6.8 SeqNo Synch Message

   The SeqNo Synch message is sent to synchronize the IPsec SA's 
   Sequence Number and Anti-reply Window information among the 
   Active HA and Backup HAs. The Source and Destination address fields 
   of the IPv6 header MUST be set to sender's and receiver's unicast 
   link-local addresses.
