Introduction   The emergence of radio technology enabled a large variety of new   types of devices to be interconnected, at a very low marginal cost   compared to wire, at any range from Near Field to interplanetary   distances, and in circumstances where wiring would be less than   practical, for instance rotating devices.   In particular, IEEE802.14.5 [IEEE802154] that is chartered to specify   PHY and MAC layers for radio Lowpower Lossy Networks (LLNs), defined   the TimeSlotted Channel Hopping [I-D.ietf-6tisch-tsch] (TSCH) mode of   operation as part of the IEEE802.15.4e MAC specification in order to   address Time Sensitive applications.   The  6TISCH architecture  [I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture] specifies   the operation IPv6 over the IEEE802.15.4e TimeSlotted Channel Hopping   [I-D.ietf-6tisch-tsch] (TSCH) wireless networks attached and   synchronized by backbone routers.  In that model, route Computation   may be achieved in a centralized fashion by a Path Computation   Element (PCE), in a distributed fashion using the Routing Protocol   for Low Power and Lossy Networks  [RFC6550] (RPL), or in a mixed   mode.  The Backbone Routers may typically serve as roots for the RPL   domain.   6TiSCH was created to simplify the adoption of IETF technology by   other Standard Defining Organizations (SDOs), in particular in the   Industrial Automation space, which already relies on variations of   IEEE802.15.4e TSCH for Wireless Sensor Networking.  ISA100.11a   [ISA100.11a] is an example of such industrial WSN standard, using   IEEE802.15.4e over the classical IEEE802.14.5 PHY. In that case,   after security is applied, roughly 80 octets are available per frame   for IP and Payload.  In order to 1) avoid fragmentation and 2)   conserve energy, the SDO will scrutinize any bit in the frame and   reject any waste.Thubert                 Expires October 17, 2014                [Page 2]Internet-Draft  The IPv6 Flow Label within a RPL domain       April 2014   The challenge to obtain the adoption of IPv6 in the original standard   was really to save any possible bit in the frames, including the UDP   checksum which was an interesting discussion on its own.  This work   was actually one of the roots for the 6LoWPAN Header Compression   [RFC6282] work, which goes down to the individual bits to save space   in the frames for actual data, and allowed ISA100.11a to adopt IPv6.1.1.  On LLN flows   In industrial applications such as control systems [RFC5673], a   packet loss is usually acceptable but jitter and latency must be   strictly controlled as they can play a critical role in the   interpretation of the measured information.  Sensory systems are   often distributed, and the control information can in fact be   originated from multiple sources and aggregated.  As a result, it can   be a requirement for related measurements from multiple sources to be   treated as a single flow following a same path over the Internet in   order to experience similar jitter and latency.  The traditional   tuple of source, destination and ports might then not be the proper   indication to isolate a meaningful flow.   In a typical LLN application, the bulk of the traffic consists of   small chunks of data (in the order few bytes to a few tens of bytes)   at a time.  In the industrial case, a typical frequency is 4Hz but it   can be a lot slower than that for, say, environmental monitoring.   The granularity of traffic from a single source is too small to make   a lot of sense in load balancing application.   In such cases, related packets from multiple sources should not be   load-balanced along their path in the Internet; load-balancing can be   discouraged by tagging those packets with a same Flow Label in the   IPv6  [RFC2460] header.  This can be achieved if the Flow Label in   packets outgoing a RPL domain are set by the root of the RPL   structure as opposed to the actual source.  It derives that the Flow   Label could be reused inside the RPL domain.   In a LLN, each transmitted bit represents energy and every saving   counts dearly.  Considering that the value for which the Flow Label   is used in the IPv6 Flow Label Specification  [RFC6437] is to serve   load balancing in the core, it is unlikely that LLN devices will   consume energy to generate and then transmit a Flow Label to serve   interests in some other place.  On the other hand, it makes sense to   recommend the computation of a stateless Flow Label at the root of   the LLN towards the Internet.Thubert                 Expires October 17, 2014                [Page 3]Internet-Draft  The IPv6 Flow Label within a RPL domain       April 2014   Reciprocally, [RFC6437] requires that once set, a non-zero flow label   value is left unchanged.  The value for that setting is consumed once   the packet has traversed the core and reaches the LLN.  Then again,   there is little value but a high cost for the LLN in spending 20 bits   to transport a Flow Label from the Internet over the constrained   network to the destination node.  It results that the MUST in   [RFC6437] should be alleviated for packets coming from the outside on   the LLN, and that it should be acceptable that the compression over   the LLN erases the original flow label.  It should also be acceptable   that the Flow Label field is reused in the LLN as proposed in this   draft.1.2.  On Wasted Resources   The Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL)   [RFC6550] specification defines a generic Distance Vector protocol   that is adapted to a variety of LLNs.  RPL forms Destination Oriented   Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAGs) which root often acts as the Border   Router to connect the RPL domain to the Internet.  The root is   responsible to select the RPL Instance that is used to forward a   packet coming from the Internet into the RPL domain.   A classical RPL implementation will use the RPL Option for Carrying   RPL Information in Data-Plane Datagrams  [RFC6553] to tag a packet   with the Instance ID and other information that RPL requires for its   operation within the RPL domain.  In particular, the Rank, which is   the scalar metric computed by an specialized Objective Function such   as [RFC6552], is modified at each hop and allows to validate that the   packet progresses in the execpted direction each upwards or downwards   in along the DODAG.   With [RFC6553] the RPL option is encoded as 6 Octets; it must be   placed in a Hop-by-Hop header that represents 2 additional octets for   a total of 8. In order to limit its range to the inside the RPL   domain, the Hop-by-Hop header must be added to (or removed from)   packets that cross the border of the RPL domain.  For reasons such as   the capability to send ICMP errors back to the source, this operation   involves an extra IP-in-IP encapsulation inside the RPL domain for   all the packets which path is not contained within the RPL domain.   The 8-octets overhead is detrimental to the LLN operation, in   particular with regards to bandwidth and battery constraints.  The   extra encapsulation may cause a containing frame to grow above   maximum frame size, leading to Layer 2 or 6LoWPAN [RFC4944]   fragmentation, which in turn cause even more energy spending and   issues discussed in the LLN Fragment Forwarding and Recovery [I-D   .thubert-6lo-forwarding-fragments].Thubert                 Expires October 17, 2014                [Page 4]Internet-Draft  The IPv6 Flow Label within a RPL domain       April 2014               ------+---------                            ^                     |          Internet                   |                     |                                     | Native IPv6                  +-----+                                  |                  |     | Border Router (RPL Root)    ^    |    ^                  |     |                             |    |    |                  +-----+                             |    |    | IPv6 +                     |                                |    |    | HbH               o    o   o    o                        |    |    | headers           o o   o  o   o  o  o o   o                 |    |    |          o  o o  o o    o   o   o  o  o              |    |    |          o   o    o  o     o  o    o  o  o           |    |    |         o  o   o  o   o         o   o o              v    v    v         o        o  o         o        o o         o          o             o     o                              LLN   Considering that, in the classical IEEE802.14.5 PHY that is used by   ISA100.11a, roughly 80 octets are available per frame after security   is applied, and  , any additional transmitted octet weights in the   energy consumption and drains the batteriesBut [RFC6282] does not   provide an efficient compression for the RPL option so the cost in   current implementations can not be alleviated in any fashion.  So   even for packets that are confined within the RPL domain and do not   need the 6in6 encapsulation, the use of the flow label instead of the   RPL option would be a valuable saving.1.3.  On Compatibility With Existing Standards   All the packets from all the nodes in a same DODAG that are leaving a   RPL domain towards the Internet will transit via a same RPL root.   The RPL root segregates the Internet and the RPL domain, which   enables the capability to reuse the Flow Label within the RPL domain.   On the other hand, the operation of writing/rewriting the IPv6 Flow   Label at the root of a RPL domain may seem in contradiction with the   IPv6 Flow Label Specification  [RFC6437], in that it is neither the   source nor the first hop router that sets the final Flow Label for   use outside the RPL domain.   Additionally, using the Flow Label to transport the information that   is classically present in the RPL option implies that the Flow Label   is modified at each hop inside the RPL domain, which again   contradicts [RFC6437], which explicitly requires that the flow label   cannot be modified once set.Thubert                 Expires October 17, 2014                [Page 5]Internet-Draft  The IPv6 Flow Label within a RPL domain       April 2014   But if we consider the whole RPL domain as a large virtual host from   the standpoint of the rest of the Internet, the interests that lead   to [RFC6437], and in particular load balancing in the core of the   Internet, are probably better served if the root guarantees that the   Flow Label is set in a compliant fashion than if we rely on each   individual sensor that may not use it at all, or use it slightly   differently such as done in ISA100.11a.   Additionally, LLN flows can be compound flows aggregating information   from multiple sources.  The root is an ideal place to rewrite the   Flow Label to a same value for a same flow across multiple sources,   ensuring compliance with the rules defined by [RFC6437] for use   outside of the RPL domain and in particular in the core of the   Internet.   It can be noted that [RFC6282] provides an efficient header   compression for packets that do have the Flow Label set in the IPv6   header.  It results overhead for transporting the RPL information can   be down from 64 to 20 bits, alleviating at the same time the need for   IP-in-IP encapsulation.  This optimization cannot be ignored, and is   required for the adoption of the 6TiSCH architecture by external   standard bodies.   This document specifies how the Flow Label can be reused within the   RPL domain as a replacement to the RPL option.  The use of the Flow   Label within a RPL domain is an instance of the stateful scenarios as   discussed in [RFC6437]where the states include the rank of a node and   the RPLInstanceID that identifies the routing topology.2.  Terminology   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].   The Terminology used in this document is consistent with and   incorporates that described in `Terminology in Low power And Lossy   Networks' [RFC7102] and [RFC6550].3.  Flow Label Format Within the RPL Domain   [RFC6550] section 11.2 specifies the fields that are to be placed   into the packets for the purpose of Instance Identification, as well   as Loop Avoidance and Detection.  Those fields include an 'O', and   'R' and an 'F' bits, the 8-bit RPLInstanceID, and the 16-bit   SenderRank.  SenderRank is the result of the DAGRank operation on the   rank of the sender, where the DAGRank operation is defined in section   3.5.1 as:      DAGRank(rank) = floor(rank/MinHopRankIncrease)Thubert                 Expires October 17, 2014                [Page 6]Internet-Draft  The IPv6 Flow Label within a RPL domain       April 2014   If MinHopRankIncrease is set to a multiple of 256, it appears that   the most significant 8 bits of the SenderRank will be all zeroes and   could be ommitted.  In that case, the Flow Label MAY be used as a   replacement to the [RFC6553] RPL option.  To achive this, the   SenderRank is expressed with 8 least significant bits, and the   information carried within the Flow Label in a packet is constructed   follows:              0                   1                   2           0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                  | |O|R|F|  SenderRank   | RPLInstanceID |                  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+      The first (leftmost) bit of the Flow Label is reserved and should be   set to zero.4.  Root Operation   [RFC6437] section 3 intentionally does not consider flow label values   in which any of the bits have semantic significance.  However, the   present specification assigns semantics to various bits in the flow   label, destroying  within the edge network that is the RPL domaina   property of belonging to a      statistically uniform distribution   that is desirable in the rest of the Internet.  This property MUST be   restored by the root for outgoing packets.   It can be noted that the rationale for the statistically uniform   distribution does not necessarily bring a lot of value within the RPL   domain.  In a specific use case where it would, that value must be   compared with that of the battery savings in order to decide which   technique the deployment will use to transport the RPL information.4.1.  Incoming Packets   When routing a packet towards the RPL domain, the root applies a   policy to determine whether the Flow Label is to be used to carry the   RPL information.  If so, the root MUST reset the Flow Label and then   it MUST set all the fields in the Flow Label as prescribed by   [RFC6553] using the format specified in Figure 2. In particular, the   root selects the Instance that will be used to forward the packet   within the RPL domain.4.2.  Outgoing Packets   When routing a packet outside the RPL domain, the root applies a   policy to determine whether the Flow Label was used to carry the RPL   information.  If so, the root MUST reset the Flow Label.  The root   SHOULD recompute a Flow Label following the rules prescribed by   [RFC6553].  In particular, the root MAY ignore the source address but   it SHOULD use the RPLInstanceID for the computation.Thubert                 Expires October 17, 2014                [Page 7]Internet-Draft  The IPv6 Flow Label within a RPL domain       April 20145.  RPL node Operation   Depending on the policy in place, the source of a packet will decide   whether to use this specification to transport the RPL information in   the IPv6 packets.  If it does, the source in the LLN SHOULD set the   Flow Label to zero and MUST NOT expect that the flow label will be   conserved end-to-end".6.  Security Considerations   The process of using the Flow Label as opposed to the RPL option does   not appear to create any opening for new threat compared to   [RFC6553].7.  IANA Considerations   No IANA action is required for this specification.8.
