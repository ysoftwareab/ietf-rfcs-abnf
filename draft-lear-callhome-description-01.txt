Abstract

   Many devices make use of so-called "Call Home" functionality in order
   to be managed or updated, or to otherwise establish outbound
   communication in the face of NATs, firewalls, and mobility.  This
   memo defines call home functionality, discusses the requirement for
   firewall traversal, some mechanisms used, and security considerations
   of those mechanisms.  Several existing examples will be shown.  This
   memo also contains a proposal for making SNMP and ISMs a call-home
   protocol.

1.  Introduction

   In the early days of the networking it was recognized that some
   devices would be intermittantly reachable.  Mechanisms such as UUCP
   were based on this notion, and support for systems requesting that
   the server act as the client showed up in the Internet no later than
   1982 in SMTP [3] and were formalized in Blocks Extensible eXchange
   Protocol (BEEP) [4] in 2001.

   However, in the early days of the Internet it also largely didn't
   matter from a network security or transparency standpoint which
   device initiated communication, because there was little if any
   network security and everyone used public address space.  With the
   introduction of private address space [5] and firewalls the world
   changed.  Today a firewall with NAT functionality is a consumer
   device, not to mention an interdepartmental device.

   In addition, the complexity of IT relationships and the number of
   vendors that support enterprises has changed the underlying
   assumption that the enterprise actually manages its own network and
   support devices, such as power distribution units.  Often for small
   businesses, today, the situation is reversed and it is the small
   business that has limited access to even the network layer of their
   data center service provider.

   All of this leads us to the conclusion that a flexible means for
   management applications to traverse firewalls is a useful approach in
   the face of devices that intercept unacknowledged SYNS or keep
   translation tables based on connection state.


2.  What is Call Home?

   "Call Home" refers simply to the notion of reversing the party that
   traditionally initiates a communication.  An early example of Call
   Home is the SMTP "TURN" command where the SMTP server becomes the
   client and the client becomes the server.  Various system management
   protocols such as Track [1][2] have offered similar functionality for
   quite some time.


3.  What is Call Home good for?

   Call Home is useful for devices that do not retain a stable
   accessible point within a network.  For instance, a lap top or a
   wireless phone may move from one location to another, and yet it
   still is be desirable for that device to be managed when it is
   online.  Imagine what would be necessary in order to manage such a

   device by having the manager contact it:
   1.  Either the DNS would have to be updated with the mobile devices
       new address or the device would have to make use of MOBILE-IP
       [ref];
   2.  The device would have to remain in either the global address
       space or within the same address space as the manager;
   3.  Because firewalls often only allow communications one way without
       prior arrangement (if they have the capability at all), they
       would have to be informed of the device's new location and that
       the device is authorized to receive requests.


4.  How is Call Home achieved?

   Call Home already exists in those session-based unicast protocols
   where the allowed operations and responses do not differ based on who
   initiated the connection.  An example in the routing world would be
   BGP.  Once the connection is established each side authenticates to
   the other and the same protocol operations may be executed by either
   end.  In the application world, so-called "peer to peer" protocols
   that are used for (often illicit) file transfer also fit this
   description.

   Often, however, protocols are designed with client and server roles.
   Examples include SMTP, and NNTP.  In these cases, some additional
   support within the application is necessary.  In SMTP's case the TURN
   and ETRN capabilities provide a means for ends to switch roles of
   client and server.  In NNTP a separate mechanism to retrieve articles
   - NEWNEWS - allows transfer agents to retrieve articles in a similar
   (albeit not identitical) way the IHAVE operation and a queue of
   messages.

   The applicability of Call Home in circumstances other than those
   above is extremely limited.  For instance, protocols that are based
   on atomic transactions, such as DNS queries, have no need to reverse
   client and server roles.  Indeed one would wonder of the intent of a
   name server that attempted to require a client to make a query of it.
   Similarly, the notion of Call Home in a multicast environment is
   likely limited as well as it is not clear who would reverse roles.

   Because TCP state is easily detected in the header via the ACK bit,
   call home is also most easily implemented in TCP.  Because connection
   state is not as easily discerned for protocols based on UDP,
   firewalls may be more retiscent to pass UDP traffic and simple NAT
   mapping timeouts may require contrived or dummy transactions to
   retain the mapping, but the same principle would apply.  Hence the
   usefulness of Call Home in a UDP environment may diminish.

5.  How does Call Home change the nature of the communication?

   There are several differences between the traditional connection
   approach and Call Home.  In the traditional case of a manager and an
   agent, the manager would make a request of the agent at any point
   when the manager wishes.  In the case of Call Home, the manager must
   wait at least until the agent has established a transport connection.
   This also means that control of connection frequency passes from the
   manager to the agent.  If frequency is important either the behavior
   must be codified somehow or the manager must pass these parameters to
   the agent and the agent must use them.

   A change of who is listening for new connections in the cases of TCP
   or SCTP further means that a potential DDOS target passes from the
   agent to the manager.

   In the traditional case, a manager may use any local TCP or UDP port
   to initiate a connection but must connect to the agent on a well
   known (or at least prearranged) port.  In the call home case, again
   the roles are reversed, and it is the manager that must service
   requests on a well known port.

   In the traditional case, each agent has a stable well known address,
   just as it has a well known port.  In the case of Call Home, the
   manager must maintain a stable well known address.


6.  Security Considerations

   The nature of security of the communication is likely to change.
   While there are many aspects of this problem, the common traditional
   case requires that the agent somehow authenticate its host address
   (either via X.509 certificate or SSH host key) and the manager
   authenticates via public key or username and password.  Once again,
   with Call Home these roles are reversed: the manager authenticates
   its host address and the agent authenticates via public key or
   username and password.

   Some applications might require some additional configuration,
   therefore, in order to accomodate Call Home.  For instance, SNMP
   requires that the command generator be associated with a
   SecurityName.  If the agent initiates the connection, either it must
   derive the security name from something like the host key or subject
   in the certificate of a manager, or it must be preconfigured with a
   username to associate the connection.

   As we discuss elsewhere in this document Call Home reverses use of
   well known ports and services.  It is important for Call Home

   protocols to make use of well known ports in order to respect the
   legitimate wishes of firewall administrators.  Such use makes (more)
   reasonable the assumption that a port is blocked for a reason.


7.  Example 1: NETCONF using SSH

   NETCONF [6] is a fairly simple client/server protocol.  NETCONF is
   mapped to several protocols, including SSH.[7] In order for Netconf
   agents to call home some protocol operation must be passed to the
   manager for this purpose, and this operation can occur in the
   protocol mapping layer.  Thus, the simplest approach would be to have
   a new SSH subsystem called "netconf-turn&qout;.  When the SSH client
   invokes this subsystem, the SSH server either will initiatiate the
   the subsystem and proceed with NETCONF capabilities exchange from the
   point of view of a manager or refuse to initiate the subsystem.

   The nature of the NETCONF communication changes in that the manager
   must wait for the agent to connect, as mentioned above.  There are no
   events explicitly defined in NETCONF at this time and so there are no
   explicit functions that require deferral from a protocol standpoint.
   However, the manager cannot configure the agent until it connects and
   so completion of a configuration request may be deferred when a
   manager is not in communication with an agent.  The manager must
   retain configuration requests and higher level application must be
   able to deal with such deferrals.

   From an authentication standpoint, the SSH server must determine
   whether based on the credentials given the client has appropriate
   access to be managed.  Each NETCONF management operation on the SSH
   server must be governed by those credentials.

   On the client, it would be a misconfiguration for it to invoke the
   netconf-turn subsystem on the manager and then not allow ANY
   operations, but each operation must be authorized based on the server
   identity passed up by the SSH subsystem.


8.  Example 2: SNMP over SSH

   Let us again first discuss the nature of the communication.  In the
   case of SNMP there are ostensibly two basic protocol operations -
   request and response.  While in theory either entity may make such
   requests in practice only one end issues GET, SET, or GET-BULK
   operations while the other end issues notifications.

   SNMP does not specify when GET, SET, and GET-BULK are to be executed,
   as these choices are left to the application or the user.  Therefore,

Internet-Draft           Call Home Functionality            October 2005


   the analysis given for netconf regarding deferral is just as
   applicable to SNMP.  However, in the case of notifications, SNMP does
   specify when these occur based on the MIB definitions.  Had the
   designers of SNMP version 3 not allowed for the SNMP-TARGET-MIB, a
   change to the protocol base would have been required.  But because
   such a MIB exists, all that remains is how it should be configured.
   There are two cases:
      It is desired that no events be deferred and the agent connect to
      the manager, just as wouldbe the case in RFC 3430.  In this case,
      the SNMP-TARGET-MIB is configured externally to use (presumably)
      the SSHSM security model to contact the manager when a
      notification is to be sent.  The SSHSM will define initial
      connection semantics.
      It is desired that notifications be deferred until the manager
      contacts the agent.  Here once the SSHSM subsystem is invoked by
      the manager, a policy is triggered to configure the SNMP-TARGET-
      MIB to receive events appropriate to the manager.

   The following is speculative as work on [8] is not complete.  That
   document specifies a means to extend the SNMP protocol to use SSH.
   SSH establishes a session and will to SNMP via SSHSM a securityName
   that may be used for purposes of authorization.  Once established the
   connection may be used for any purpose, no matter the original
   purpose in a vein similar to that specified by RFC 3430 [9] provided
   each end is properly authorized.  Once again, it would be a
   configuration error for a device to connect for the purposes of being
   monitored or configured by a manager to not accept any operations.
   It would similarly be a configuration error for a device to connect
   for purposes of sending notifications but then not have any possibly
   allowed.


9.  IANA Considerations

   While much of this is protocol specific it is within the realm of
   possibilities that with client/server protocols either a new port or
   an SSH service name or a BEEP URN will be needed to indicate the
   intent of the initiator of communication to "turn" it.


10.  Summary

   Call Home is a useful - and in some circumstances necessary -
   firewall and NAT traversal approach applications can use to augment
   their existing approach in order to establish communications with
   devices that sit behind NATs or firewalls, or otherwise have
   intermittant connectivity.
