Abstract

   This document defines the properties and format for the core SIP user
   agent profile data set.  The properties defined in this document are
   expected to be common to most SIP user agents regardless of whether
   the user agent support audio, video, text or any combination of
   media.  These core SIP properties are considered to to be a data set.

   Several datasets may be combined into documents or profiles that are
   provided to SIP user agents so that they can operate with the desired
   behavior.

Internet-Draft               SIP UA Data Set                October 2005


1.  Motivation

   The SIP Profile Data Sets defined in this document support the
   principle to enable SIP User Agents to obtain and use profile data
   sets from multiple sources in order to support a wide range of
   applications without undue complexity.

   The SIP Protocol Data Set is intended the be the lowest common
   denominator among all user agent types regardless of capability.
   This data set contains properties that all user agents require.  That
   does not mean that all of these properties are mandatory.

   [I-D.ietf-sipping-config-framework] defines a configuration framework
   for finding, retrieving and change notification of profile data for
   SIP [RFC3261] user agents.  It is intended that the SIP dataset
   defined in this document may be contained in the user, device and
   local-network profiles described in the configuration framework.
   [I-D.petrie-sipping-profile-datasets] defines a general XML schema to
   contain user agent profile data.  This document defines core SIP
   specific data by extending the profile data sets schema.


2.  Introduction

   This document defines the properties and format for the core SIP user
   agent profile data set.  The following properties are defined in this
   document:
      transport_protocols
      outbound_proxies
      sip_methods
      sip_option_tags
   and, are expected to be common to most SIP user agents regardless of
   whether the user agent support audio, video, text or any combination
   of media.  These core SIP properties are considered to to be a data
   set.

2.1.  Requirements Terminology

   Keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT" and
   "MAY" that appear in this document are to be interpreted as described
   in RFC 2119[RFC2119].

2.2.  Profile Data Terminology

   property - a named configurable characteristic of a user agent.  A
      given property has a well-defined range of possible values.  A
      given property may be defined to have range of values, allow for
      simultaneous use of many values (as in a list of allowed
      possibilities), or be a set of related values that collectively
      form a single profile information item.
   setting - the binding of a specific value or set of values to a given
      property.
   profile - a collection of settings to be applied for a specific user,
      device, or local network.
   device - SIP user agent, either software or hardware appliance.  This
      is a logical concept, as there may be no physical dedicated device
      or it may be part of an assembly of devices.  In this document,
      the terms "user agent" and "device" are interchangeable.
   user profile - the profile that applies to a specific user.  This is
      best illustrated by the "hotelling" use case - a user has an
      association for some period of time with a particular device.  The
      user profile is that set of profile data the user wants to
      associate with that device (e.g. ringtones used when someone calls
      them, the user's shortcuts).
   device profile - data profile that applies to a specific device.  In
      the "hotelling" use case, this is the data that is bound to the
      device itself independent of the user.  It relates to specific
      capabilities of the device and/or preferences of the owner of the
      device.
   local network profile - data that applies to the user agent in the
      context of the local network.  This is best illustrated by roaming
      applications; a new device appears in the local network (or a
      device appears in a new network, depending on the point of view).
      The local network profile includes settings and perhaps policies
      that allow the user agent to function in the local network (e.g.
      how to traverse NAT or firewall, bandwidth constraints).
   data set - a collection of properties.
   working profile - the set of property values actually set in a SIP
      User Agent as a result of merging the profiles from all sources;
      the actual effective profile for the user agent .
   merging - the operation of resolving overlapping settings from
      multiple profiles.  Overlap occurs when the same property occurs
      in multiple profiles (e.g. user, device, local network).

2.3.  Overview

   The Core SIP UA profile data set is defined in Section 3 and complies
   with the guidelines provided in Section 5 of [I-D.petrie-sipping-
   profile-datasets]

   Section 4 provides illustrative example profiles and use cases for
   merging.  Security considerations are addresed in Section 5.

   The following is an example instance of the SIP protocol data set.
   Note the use of the policy attribute.


   <property_set>
     <transport_protocols>
       <transport_protocol policy="allow">
         <name>UDP</name>
         <port>5060</port>
       </transport_protocol>
       <transport_protocol policy="allow">
         <name>TCP</name>
         <port>5060</port>
       </transport_protocol>
       <transport_protocol policy="allow">
         <name>TLS</name>

3.  Core SIP Data Set

   The XML schema defined in this document extends the root element
   "property_set" schema defined in I-D.petrie-sipping-profile-datasets.

3.1.  Transport Protocol Data Set

3.1.1.  transport_protocols Data Set Properties Definitions

   transport_protocols - This property contains properties related to
      SIP transport protocols, and is an XML element that extends on the
      XML "setting_container" element contained in the root
      "property_set" element.  It serves as a container for a list of
      SIP transport protcols to allow or disallow.  There may be zero or

Internet-Draft               SIP UA Data Set                October 2005


      one elements.

3.1.2.  transport_protocols  Element Definition

   transport_protocol - The "transport_protocol" is an XML element that
      extends the "setting" element contained in the
      "transport_protocols" element.  The "transport_protocol" element
      contains properties related to a SIP transport protocol.  It names
      the transport protocol, defines whether the protocol is enabled or
      not and defines the port to which that protocol is bound.  If the
      protocol is named it defaults to enabled if not explicitly set.
      If the port property is not set, it defaults to the default
      specified by the specification which binds the protocol to SIP.
      The user agent should enable all the set transport protocols that
      are supported by the user agent.  The user agent ignores protocol
      bindings that it does not support.  The user agent may default
      transport protocols that it supports to enabled, if a protocol
      property for that transport protocol is not present in the data
      set.  The order of the list of transport_protocol setting values
      indicated by the "q" attribute indicates the order of preference.
      There may be zero or more "transport_protocol" elements in the
      "transport_protocols" element.
   name - This XML element identifies the specific transport protocol,
      and extends the "setting" element contained in
      transport_protocols.  There must be exactly one "name" element in
      a "transport_protocol".
   port - This element identifies the port for binding the transport
      protocol, and extends the "setting" element contained in
      transport_protocols.  There must be exactly one "port" element in
      a "transport_protocol".

3.1.3.  Merging Different Sources of a transport_protocol Data Set

   The "transport_protocol" property uses the "policy" attribute to
   identify whether the transport protocol is allowed or disallowed.
   The "q" attribute is used for ordering of the list.  In addition, a
   visibility attribute may be present.

   If there are matches on multiple "name" element values, the "policy"
   attribute will determine which is allowed or not.  As defined in
   Merging Datasets [I-D.petrie-sipping-profile-datasets] properties
   with conflicting "policy" attribute value of "allow" and "disallow"
   are assumed to be "disallowed".  If there are multiple
   "transport_protocol" elements from different profiles with the same
   "name" element value and "policy" attribute values of "allows", then
   the resulting merged "transport_protocols" element will contain one
   "transport_protocol" element having a "name" element of that value.
   The "port" element value will be determined in the following order of

   the source profile, when there are multiple "transport_protocol"
   elements from different profiles with the same "name" element value
   and "policy" attribute value of "allow":
      Local
      Device
      User
      Application

3.2.  outbound_proxy

3.2.1.  outbound_proxy Data Set Properties Definitions

   outbound_proxies - The "outbound_proxies" property is an XML element
      that extends on the XML "setting" element contained in the root
      "property_set" element.  It serves as a container for a list of
      outbound proxies.  There may be zero or one element.  The default
      outbound proxy, through which all SIP requests, not explicitly
      routed, should be sent.  The format of this parameter is of name-
      addr as specified in [RFC3261].  This property is optional.  If
      absent or not set, SIP requests are sent to directly to the URI of
      the request.  If set the effect of this property is to add a loose
      route as defined in [RFC3261] for the next hop destination.

3.2.2.  outbound_proxies Element Definition

   outbound_proxies - The "outbound_proxy" is an XML element that
      extends the XML "setting" element contained in "outbound_proxies".
      There may be zero, one or many "outbound_proxy" elements.  It
      provides default value for an outbound proxy, through which all
      SIP requests, not explicitly routed, should be sent.  The format
      of this parameter is of name-addr as specified in [RFC3261].  This
      property is optional.  If absent or not set, SIP requests are sent
      to directly to the URI of the request.  If set the effect of this
      property is to add a loose route as defined in [RFC3261] for the
      next hop destination.  Multiple "outbound_proxy" elements may be
      contained in the "outbound_proxies" element to form a route set."

3.2.3.  outbound_proxies Merging Different Sources of a Data Set

   The aggregation approach is used to resolve conflicts.  By
   aggregating the multiple outbound proxies, the local network profile
   provided outbound proxy allows the signaling to get out of the local
   network and the device profile provided outbound proxy is able to
   monitor all SIP signaling from the user agent.  The order of the
   resulting merged, route set is determined by the "q" attibute.

3.3.  sip_methods

3.3.1.  sip_methods Data Set Properties Definitions

   sip_methods - This property contains properties related to SIP
      Methods, and is an XML element that extends on the XML "setting"
      element contained in the root "property_set" element.  It serves
      as a container for a list of SIP request methods to allow or
      disallow.  Typically, only provide by the device dataset.  The
      "sip_methods" element is intended to provide a means of enabling
      or diabling features in the SIP user agent based upon the SIP
      request method.

3.3.2.  sip_methods Element Definition

   sip_method - An element to specify a SIP method, and extends the
      "setting" element contained in the "sip_methods" element.  There
      may be zero or more elements.  For user agents that support the
      method indicated, this element serves as a switch to enable or
      disable the named SIP method as indicated by the "policy"
      attribute.

3.3.3.  sip_methods Merging Different Sources of a Data Set

   The "sip_methods" Data Set uses the aggregation merging policy
   defined in [I-D.petrie-sipping-profile-datasets].  When multiple
   "sip_method" elements with the same value are provided, the "policy"
   attribute is used to determine precidence.

3.4.  sip_option_tags

3.4.1.  sip_option_tags Data Set Properties Definitions

   sip_option_tags - This property specifies a container for a list of
      SIP option tags that are allowed or disallowed, and is an XML
      element that extends on the XML "setting" element contained in the
      root "property_set" element.  For user agents that suppport
      features indicated by option tags, this element serves as a list
      of features to turn on or off as indicated by the "policy"
      attribute in the "sip_option_tag" element.

3.4.2.  sip_option_tags Element Definition

   sip_option_tag - An element to specify a SIP option tag, and extends
      the "setting" element and is contained in "sip_option_tags"
      element.  There may be zero or more elements "sip_option_tag".
      For user agents that suppport features indicated by option tags,
      this element serves as a switch to enable or disable the named SIP

      option as indicated by the policy attribute in the
      "sip_option_tag" element.

3.4.3.  sip_option_tags Merging Different Sources of a Data Set

   The sip_option_tags Data Set uses the default aggregation merging
   policy defined in [I-D.petrie-sipping-profile-datasets].  When
   multiple "sip_method" elements with the same value are provided, the
   "policy" attribute is used to determine precidence.


4.  Example Profiles and Use

4.1.  Merge Two Data Sets

   Consider the use case described in [I-D.petrie-sipping-profile-
   datasets] where the user wishes to indicate that only secure SIP
   transport should be used.  The device profile may contain SIP
   Protocol Data Set (see Section 3.1) settings that look like the
   following:


   <property_set>
     <transport_protocols>
       <transport_protocol policy="allow">
         <name>UDP</name>
         <port>5060</port>
       </transport_protocol>
       <transport_protocol policy="allow">
         <name>TCP</name>
         <port>5060</port>
       </transport_protocol>
       <transport_protocol policy="allow">
         <name>TLS</name>
         <port>5061</port>
       </transport_protocol>
     </transport_protocols>
     <outbound_proxies>
       <outbound_proxy>
         sip:outproxy.example.com
       </outbound_proxy>
     </outbound_proxies>
     <sip_methods>
       <sip_method policy="disallow">INFO</sip_method>
     </sip_methods>
     <sip_option_tags>
       <sip_option_tag policy="disallow">join</sip_option_tag>
     </sip_option_tags>

   </property_set>


   The user profile which indicates that only TLS should be used would
   look like (Note: this example also indicates that port 5061 should be
   used.  This may be more constrained than the user really wants.):


   <property_set>
     <transport_protocols>
       <transport_protocol policy="allow">
         <name>TLS</name>
         <port>5061</port>
       </transport_protocol>
       <transport_protocol policy="disallow">
         <name>UDP</name>
       </transport_protocol>
       <transport_protocol policy="disallow">
         <name>TCP</name>
       </transport_protocol>
     </transport_protocols>

4.2.  Policy Filtering

   (allowed and disallowed protocols)

4.3.  Override

   (device prefers default ports 5060, local net requires port 11000)


5.  Security Considerations

   Security is mostly a profile delivery problem.  The delivery
   framework MUST provide a secure means of delivering the profile data
   as it may contain sensitive data that would be undesirable if it were
   stolen or sniffed.  Storage of the profile on the profile delivery
   server and user agent is an implementation problem.  The profile
   delivery server and the user agent MUST provide protection that
   prevents unauthorized access of the profile data.  The profile
   delivery server and the user agent MUST enforce the access control
   policies defined in the profile data sets if present.

6.  IANA Considerations

   [TBD] XML Schema name space registration


7.  Change History

7.1.  Changes from draft-petrie-sipping-sip-dataset-00

   Removed references to policy attribribute value: "mandatory".

   A few minor edits to refresh the draft"

7.2.  Changes from draft-petrie-sipping-profile-datasets-01

   The core SIP profile data set was split out from the examples in
   draft-petrie-sipping-profile-datasets-01 to create a stand alone data
   set definition.
