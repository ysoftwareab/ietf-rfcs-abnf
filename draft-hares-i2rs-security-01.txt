1.  Introduction

   The Interface to the Routing System (I2RS) provides read and write
   access to the information and state within the routing process and
   configuration process (as illustrated in the diagram in the
   architecture document within routing elements.  The I2RS client

   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture] interacts with one or more I2RS agents
   to collect information from network routing systems.  This security
   architecture expands on the security issues involved in the I2RS
   protocol's message exchange between the I2RS client and the I2RS
   agent which are described in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture].

2.  Definitions

   This document utilizes the definitions found in the following drafts:
   [RFC4949], and [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture].

   Specifically, this document utilizes the following definitions:

   Access control

      [RFC4949] describes access control as: a) protection of system
      resources against unauthorized access, b) process controlled by a
      security policy that permits access only by authorized entities
      (users, programs, process, or others) according to that policy, c)
      preventing unauthorized use of resource, d) using human controls
      to identify or admit properly authorized people to a SCIF, and e)
      limitations on between subjects and objections in a system.  I2RS
      focuses on role-based access control (RBAC).

   Authentication

      [RFC4949] describes authentication as the process of verifying
      (i.e., establishing the truth of) an attribute value claimed by or
      for a system entity or system resource.  Authentication has two
      steps: identify and verify.

   Data Confidentiality

      [RFC4949] describes data confidentiality has having two
      properties: a) data is not disclosed to system entities unless
      they have been authorized to know, and b) data is not disclosed to
      unauthorized individuals, entities or processes.  The key point is
      that confidentiality implies that the originator has the ability
      to authorize where the information goes.  Confidentiality is
      important for both read and write scope of the data.

   Data confidentiality service

      [RFC4949] also describes data confidentiality service as a
      security service that protects data against unauthorized
      disclosure.  Please note that an operator can designate all people
      are authorized to view a piece of data which would mean a data
      confidentiality service would be essentially a null function.

   Data Privacy

      [RFC4949] describes data privacy as a synonym for data
      confidentiality.  This I2RS document will utilize data privacy as
      a synonym for data confidentiality.

   Mutual Authentication

      [RFC4949] implies that mutual authentication exists between two
      interacting system entities.  Mutual authentication in I2RS
      implies that both sides move from a state of mutual suspicion to
      mutually authenticated communication after having been identified
      and validated.

   Mutual Suspicion

      [RFC4949] defines mutual suspicion as a state that exists between
      two interacting system entities in which neither entity can trust
      the other to function correctly with regard to some security
      requirement.

   Role

      [RFC4949] describes role as a job function or employment position
      to which people or other system entities may be assigned in a
      system.  In the I2RS interface, the I2RS agent roles relate to the
      roles that the I2RS client is utilizing.  In the I2RS interface,
      the I2RS client negotiation is over the client's ability to access
      resources made available through the agent's particular role.
      Please refer to Figure 2 below.  Existing work includes IETF work
      in ABFAB and HTTP related SAML work.

   Role-based Access control

      [RFC4949] describes role-based access control as an identity-based
      access control wherein the system entities that are identified and
      controlled are functional positions in an organization or process.
      Within [RFC4949] five relationships are discussed: 1)
      administrators to assign identities to roles, 2) administrators to
      assign permissions to roles, 3) administrators to assign roles to
      roles, 4) users to select identities in sessions, and 5) users to
      select roles in sessions.  This document discusses I2RS use of
      Roles as Identities+Scope+Access where scope is the portion of the
      routing tree, and access is permissions to read or write (or
      both).  Figure 1 below provides [RFC4949] the security view roles
      and assignments (page 254).  Figure 2 provides the same conceptual
      view of role-based access control applied to I2RS's Combination of

      roles and identities that allow read, write, or read-write access
      to I2RS agent functions.

   Role hierarchy or Permissions inheritance

      [RFC4949] describes the hierarchy of roles and identities in role-
      based access control shown in Figure 1 and described above.  I2RS
      will used role-based access control as defined above, and shown in
      Figure 2.

   Role certificate

      [RFC4949] describes a role certificate as an organizational
      certificate that is issued to a system entity that is a member of
      the set of users that have identities that are assigned to the
      same role.

   Security audit trail

      [RFC4949] (page 254) describes a security audit trail as a
      chronological record of system activities that is sufficient to
      enable the reconstruction and examination of the sequence
      environments and activities surrounding or leading to an
      operation, procedure, or event in a security-relevant transaction
      from inception to final results.  To apply this to the I2RS
      system, this implies that the processes on the I2RS client-I2RS
      Agent protocol and related actions on the I2RS-Agent can record a
      set of activity that will allow the reconstruction and examination
      of the sequence of environments and activities around actions
      caused by the I2RS protocol data streams.

   I2RS integrity

      The data transfer as it is transmitted between client and agent
      cannot be modified by unauthorized parties without detection.

   The following diagram is a variation of the [RFC4949] diagram on
   role-based security, and provides the context for the assumptions of
   security on the role-based work.

3.  Security Issues

   The security for the I2RS protocol utilizes the role based access
   security for the I2RS clients access to the I2RS agent's data (read/
   write).  The I2RS [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture] treats the agent's
   notification stream or publication stream as a pre-authorized read.
   This security consideration document examines the major points:

   I2RS roles and identities

      This section looks at how I2RS roles and identities created by
      [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture], how I2RS model derived from the
      security model of role-based access control matches the
      [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture], and how Identities and roles get
      distributed?

   Data Security

      The data security section looks at incidents when the I2RS data
      stream will need confidentiality and message integrity, transport
      security, how role-based access control of I2RS data impacts the
      I2RS Information Model and Data Model design, and light weight
      clients who work without confidentiality.

   Transport Requirements for Multiple data stream connections in I2RS

      [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture] allows multiple data streams across
      one or more transports.  This section examines the security issues
      surrounding those streams.

   Subsequent sections will look how auditing, tracing and deployment
   scenarios impact the I2RS protocol.

3.1.  Security roles and Identities for the I2RS client and I2RS Agent

   All I2RS clients and I2RS agents MUST have at least one unique
   identifier that uniquely identifies each party.  The I2RS protocol
   MUST utilize these identifiers for mutual identification of the
   client and agent.  An I2RS agent, upon receiving an I2RS message from
   a client, must confirm that the client has a valid identity.  The
   client, upon receiving an I2RS message from an agent, must confirm
   the I2RS identity.

   The distribution of security identity is taken up in the section
   below.  To provide context for that discussion let us look at how
   I2RS roles are linked to that identity/identifier.

        Role = identity + routing tree + Read/Write/R-W


   Role security for an agent combines agent identity plus the potential
   read scope plus the potential write scope.  The potential read scope
   is the routing attributes/variables within a data model (for example
   BGP peer information) or a set of data models (RIB Data Mode and the
   BGP peer information) that an agent may potential read.  A
   notification or an event stream is considered a set of read scope
   data sent via different methodology.  A write scope is something the
   client may write.

   Role security exists even if multiple transport connections are being
   used between the I2RS client and I2RS agent (per
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture]).  These transport message streams may
   start/stop without affecting the existence of the client/agent data
   exchange.  TCP supports a single stream of data.  SCTP [RFC4960]
   provides security for multiple streams plus end-to-end transport of
   data.

   (Editor: Additional WG discussion will need to focus on how different
   deployments impact the transport layers, and the messages sizes (E.g.
   UDP's limited size).  Use case descriptions will guide this
   discussion.)

3.1.1.  I2RS Role-Based Access Control

   Figure 2 show a model of the I2RS role-based access control
   environment.  This model is a variation of the [RFC4949] diagram on
   role-based security shown in Figure 1.  Portions of this model are
   outside the scope of the I2RS protocol, but are part of the
   deployment environment of the I2RS protocol.  For example, the I2RS
   identity repository is a logical construct of an entity that keeps
   all the identities.  This logical entity may be implemented in
   deployments of I2RS in many ways.  One simple way is the
   administrator securely transferring a file with identities and Roles
   to the client and agent.  An automated way may be seen within the
   security identity distribution protcools in the IETF (AAA, ABFAB,
   etc).  The important point is the Roles (Identity + Rib-portion +
   Scope (Read, Write, R/W) is passed within the I2RS environment in an
   manner consistent to the logical constrains in this model.

3.1.2.  Identities

   This document suggests that identity distribution and the loading of
   these identities into I2RS agent and I2RS Client occur outside the
   I2RS protocol.  The I2RS protocol SHOULD assume some mechanism (IETF
   or private) will distribute identities and that the I2RS client/agent
   will load the identities prior to the I2RS protocol establishing a
   connection between I2RS client and I2RS agent.

   Each Identity will be linked (via internal policy) to one or more
   roles.  The context of the I2RS client-agent communication is based
   on an role which may/may not require message confidentiality, message
   integrity protection, or replay attack protection.

   I2RS clients may be used by multiple applications to configure
   routing via I2RS agents, receive status reports, turn on the I2RS
   audit stream, or turn on I2RS traceability.  An I2RS client software
   could arrange to store multiple secure identities and use the
   identity to insure that the "Status-only" application process only
   uses the client identity for status notification no matter what role
   that identity takes on.  Multiple identities provide some secondary
   level support for the application-client, but may grow the number of
   identities.  The multiple identities per client could also be used
   for multiple levels of security for the data passed between an I2RS
   client and agent as either: a) confidential, b) authorized with
   message integrity protection, c) authorized without message integrity
   protection, and or d) no protection.  See the section below for
   additional discussions on these options.

   Editor's note: The WG needs to discuss the scaling properties of the
   out of band establishment of identities (that is outside the I2RS
   protocol).

3.2.  I2RS Data Security

   I2RS data security involves determining of the I2RS client to I2RS
   agent data transfer needs to be confidential, or have message
   integrity, or support an end-to-end integrity (in the case of stacked
   clients).  This section discuss the consideration of I2RS data
   security.

   It is assumed that all I2RS data security mechanisms used for
   protecting the I2RS packets needs to be associated with proper key
   management solutions.  A key management solution needs to guarantee
   that only the entities having sufficient privileges can get the keys
   to encrypt/decrypt the sensitive data.  In addition, the key
   management mechanisms need to be able to update the keys before they

   have lost sufficient security strengths, without breaking the
   connection between the agents and clients.

3.2.1.  Data Confidentiality Requirements

   In a critical infrastructure, certain data within routing elements is
   sensitive and R/W operations on such data must be controlled in order
   to protect its confidentiality.  For example, most carriers do not
   want a router's configuration and data flow statistics known by
   hackers or their competitors.  While carriers may share peering
   information, most carriers do not share configuration and traffic
   statistics.  To achieve this, access control to sensitive data needs
   to be provided, and the confidentiality protection on such data
   during transportation needs to be enforced.

   It is normal to protect the confidentiality of the sensitive data
   during transportation by encrypting them.  Encryption obscures the
   data transported on the wire and protects them against eavesdropping
   attacks.  Because the encryption itself cannot guarantee the
   integrity or fresh of data being transported, in practice,
   confidentiality protection is normally provided with integrity
   protection.

3.2.2.  Message Integrity Requirements

   An integrity protection mechanism for I2RS should be able to ensure
   1) the data being protected are not modified without detection during
   its transportation and 2) the data is actually from where it is
   expected t come from 3) the data is not repeated from some earlier
   interaction of the protocol.  That is, when both confidentiality and
   integrity of data is properly protected, it is possible to ensure
   that encrypted data are not modified or replayed without detection.

   As a part of integrity protection, the replay protection approaches
   provided for I2RS must consider both online and offline attackers,
   and have sufficient capability to deal with intra connection and
   inter-connection attacks.  For instance, when using symmetric keys,
   sequence numbers which increase monotonically could be useful to help
   in distinguishing the replayed messages, under the assistance of
   signatures or MACs (dependent on what types of keys are applied).  In
   addition, in the cases where only offline attacker is considered,
   random nonce could be effective.

3.2.3.  End-to-End Data Integrity: Data or Transport

   The I2RS protocol is concerned with I2RS client-agent exchange.  End-
   to-end confidentiality requires at least transport layer security.
   In a simple case of a I2RS Client to a single I2RS agent transfer,



Hares, et al.           Expires December 19, 2014              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft                I2RS Security                    June 2014


   the I2RS client puts the data in to the secure transport message and
   the I2RS agent takes it out of the transport message.

   In the case of a stacked client where the I2RS-client1 talks to a
   I2RS-agent1-I2RS-client2, the data that transfers between the I2RS-
   agent-1 and I2RS-client-2 is outside the scope of the I2RS protocol.
   However, it is critical if this mechanism is used for fan-out of
   read/write commands to agents that the end-to-end data has data
   integrity.

   Editor question: Should I2RS have the optional capability to support
   end-to-end data integrity?

3.3.  Role-Based Access Control of I2RS data

   I2RS protocol uses the I2RS Role (Identity + Access (Read, Write, or
   Read/Write) to control access to the I2RS data.  The impact of I2RS
   role-based security on I2RS data models is that certain portions of
   an I2RS data models may require:

   o  confidentiality - which requires a) mutual authentication, b)
      encryption, and c) message integrity protection with its
      associated replay protection,

   o  Message integrity protection - which requires mutual
      authentication, message integrity with replay protection,

   o  mutual authentication only, or

   o  no authentication.

   Therefore, creators of I2RS Information Models (IM) and I2RS Data
   Models (DM) may want to consider the following factors:

   o  Does the client using this data model care if the agent is valid?

   o  Does the agent responding to this data model care if the client is
      valid?

   o  Does the client-agent exchange require mutual authentication for
      all of the data model or some?

   o  Does the client/agent care what operations are done? (secure
      communications)

   o  Does the client and agent care about protection - either 1)
      confidentiality or 2) replay with integrity?

Internet-Draft                I2RS Security                    June 2014


   o  Are there other security issues unique to this Informational Model
      (IM) or Data Model (DM)

3.4.  Impact of Data Confidentiality inclusion/exclusion in the I2RS
      Protocol

   Confidentiality of role implies the following:

   o  a requirement for confidentiality of I2RS routing tree scope
      (portion) in I2RS client-agent communication;

   o  I2RS client and I2RS agent mutually validate identities; and

   o  encryption is supported in the I2RS protocol.

   Mutual validation of client and agent's identities means that both:

   o  The I2RS client knows the I2RS agent has a valid identity, and
      that the I2RS agent has agreed that the I2RS client has a valid
      identity; and

   o  The I2RS agent knows that the I2RS client has a valid Identity,
      and the the I2RS client has agreed that the I2RS agent has a valid
      identity.

   I2RS WG has indicated some I2RS client-agent message exchanges will
   not need encrypt data to obscure the data.  If this is so, then the
   I2RS designers must understand if their data will be encrypted or
   sent without encryption.  Information Model (IM) and Data Model (DM)
   creators must discuss determine the following:

   o  I2RS Client to Agent: Is encryption a recommendation or
      requirement?

   o  If it is a recommendation, must the I2RS agent/client support
      encryption but only use it for certain roles (portions of the tree
      with read/write scope)?  If there are multiple channels for
      transporting data, one role could be operating without encryption
      on one part of the tree, and another role could be operating with
      encryption on another part of the tree.

   o  Does the Informational Model (IM) and Data Model (DM) make
      assumptions that would allow security attacks using the
      unencrypted data?

3.5.  Transport requirements

   The architecture provides the ability to have multiple transport
   sessions providing protocol and data communication between the I2RS
   Agent and the I2RS client.  The document does not try to specify the
   protocols for securing I2RS packets, but provides considersations in
   choosing a transport protocol.  These transports can be TCP or secure
   (SCTP) or a TLS based.  If we use TLS based transports, we can use
   TLS over UDP (DTLS) or SSL with with TLS plus extensions.

   The following are questions to address regarding the transport:

   o  Do we have mandatory-to-implement transport protocols?

   o  Will the association of I2RS Roles with transport protocols need
      to be configured in the I2RS client and I2RS agent?

   o  Do we allow the I2RS agent/client to automatically establish
      transport sessions to publish statistics for notifications/
      subscriptions?

   o  Is a publishing broker feasible or does that cause security
      issues?

4.  Audit-able Data streams

   This section discusses data streams which have a security audit trail
   (see definitions) for the I2RS Client to I2RS Agent interactions.
   The I2RS Discussion group suggested that audit data streams are:

   o  a tracing of changes sent to a separate streams, and

   o  a portion of the data selected by policy

   o  turned on/off via I2RS protocol

   I2RS is not inventing a new audit protocol as many protocols (syslog)
   are available to be used.  Verifying audit stream data is outside the
   I2RS protocol, but those designing the IM and DMs with audit stream
   capability need to provide the appropriate hooks such as: on/off
   action, data selection, and protocol (for example syslog) that the
   I2RS Agent (or I2RS routing system) sends the audit data upon.

   Agent audit trail could be the logging of what variables written by
   which client (identified by client ID) on behalf of a reported
   application (identified by the ID of the application).  The audit
   stream turned on by the I2RS Agent may need to pass both the client
   ID and the application ID to the audit stream.

Internet-Draft                I2RS Security                    June 2014


   Out of scope for this work is the ability to audit the application to
   I2RS-Client interfaces, or the I2RS Agent to I2RS routing system.

   Editor: Questions still to be answered:

   o  Is support for audit stream a requirement for all I2RS agents or
      an option dependent on the role which is dependent on the IM/DM
      (info and data models)?

   o  How does the filtering of event data impact the audit process?
      For example if BGP event changes are only taken from 50 out of 300
      BGP peers, does this stop any ability to audit the session?  Or if
      the read filters only watch for key prefixes to be received on a
      specific set of interfaces, does this stop the ability to audit?

   o  How do you handle filtering of reads/notifications by I2RS policy
      and auditing?  If the I2RS client asks to read a IM/DM tree
      portion via a Role but the that read data requested of I2RS Agent
      is filtered before sending to client, how is this handled in the
      auditing protocols?

5.  Impact of Traceability

   The draft [I-D.clarke-i2rs-traceability] provides an IM for the
   following use cases:

   o  Automated event correlations, trend analysis, and anomaly
      detection

   o  trace log storage

   o  improved accounting of routing system transactions

   o  Standardized structure data format for writing common tools

   o  real-time monitoring and troubleshooting

   o  enhanced network audit, management and forensic analysis
      capabilities

   The operational guidance in the traceability IM includes creation of
   an I2RS log that is stored in a temporary storage, rotated, and
   retrieved via syslog, I2RS "snap-shot" available as one bulk snapshot
   or subscription, and in a I2RS publish-subscribe stream.

   The security issues of the traceability log data sent to syslog are
   equivalent to the auditable data stream security issues covered in
   the previous section.  The one-bulk snapshot data model and publish/

   subscription model contain the same issues considered in the basic
   read functions described above.  The traceability log issues beyond
   this are implementation or transport protocol issues regarding scale.

6.  Deployment issues

   This section provides consideration for the deployment issues around
   stacked I2RS clients.  This section only has questions for now, and
   will be added to in future drafts.

6.1.  Stacked I2RS Agent-Clients in Broker topologies

   The [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture] describes a broker function that can
   be used in the topology server use case.  The general concept for
   such a deployment would allows the following hierarchical scenario:

                        Broker
   I 2RSclient1----I2RSagent1=I2RSclient2---I2RSagent2
                                     |-----I2RSagent3
                                     |-----I2RSagent4
                                     |-----I2RSagent5

                   Figure 3

   Editor: The implications of this deployment scenario will be added to
   this draft.  For now we have the following questions:

   o  Does Stacked I2rs agent/client require end-to-end security?

   o  Does this scenario bring unique security issues?

   o  Is this scenario outside the I2RS venue?  If

   o  If it is scope, do we need to alter the diagrams within the
      architecture document?  If so, how would we re-write the diagrams.
