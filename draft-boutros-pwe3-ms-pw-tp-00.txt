1. Introduction 

     The PWE3 Architecture [1] defines signaling and encapsulation 
   techniques for establishing Single Segment PW (SS-PW) between a pair 
   of terminating PEs. Procedures for stitching two or more static or 
   dynamic SS-PWs to form Multi-Segment PW (MS-PW) are described in [2]. 
   These procedures make use of PW status messages carried in LDP TLV 
   over dynamic PW established via LDP. [3] defines a new PW status OAM 
   message used to carry PW status in-band over static PW. This message 
   makes it possible to exchange PW status end-to-end over a MS-PW 
   consisting of one or more static PW. 

   [5] specifies operator new Operation, Administration, and Maintenance 
   (OAM) functions Lock Instruct (LI) and Loopback (LB) for associated 
   bi-directional circuits such as MPLS-TP LSP, SS-PW, and M-PW in an 
   MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) environment. These functions enable 
   network operators to lock a circuit and operate it in loopback mode 
   for testing/management purpose. LSP and PW. 

   This informational document describes the application of the existing 
   PW stitching procedures taking into consideration LI, LB, as well as 
   PW status OAM messages.

     In this section, we explain the use of LI/LB mechanisms referring 
   to the MS-PW model shown in Figure 1. The SS-PW segments PW1 and PW2 
   can be either static or dynamic. We assume that PWs are carried over 
   MPLS-TP LSPs (transport LSPs) so that LI/LB mechanisms can be applied

   at the transport LSP level, as well we consider the application of 
   LI/LB at PW level. 

   PW status is sent via LDP message and PW OAM message respectively 
   over dynamic and static PW segments. Note that even though only two 
   PW segments are considered in the examples below, the described 
   procedures are applicable to MS-PWs with more than two segments.

3.1. Lock Operation 

3.1.1. Locking MPLS-TP LSP 

   An MPLS-TP LSP can be taken out of service for maintenance operation 
   using the LI mechanism described in [5]. LI messages are exchanged 
   between MPLS-TP Maintenance End Points (MEPs). In the case of MS-PW, 
   each MPLS-TP LSP associated with a given PW segment can be 
   individually locked for management purpose. This means that, in a MS-
   PW scenario, a T-PE is always a MEP and an S-PE can either be a MIP 
   or a MEP for an MPLS-TP LSP carrying PW segments. Furthermore, a T-PE 
   (MEP) assumes that an MPLS-TP LSP is successfully locked only when 
   the corresponding LI reply is received from the other intended 
   receiver MEP (other T-PE or S-PE). 

3.1.1.1. LI originated at T-PE 

   Assume that T-PE1 originates LI request for the MPLS-TP LSP carrying 
   PW1. The intended recipient of the message can be either S-PE or T-
   PE2. When T-PE1 receives positive LI reply from the intended 
   recipient (T-PE2 or S-PE), it assumes that the MPLS-TP LSP is 
   successfully locked, and takes PW1 and all other PWs associated with 
   the MPLS-TP LSP out of service. This means that PW1 and all other 
   impacted PWs will no longer carry user data. 

   If S-PE receives an LI request, and if the intended MPLS-TP LSP can 
   be locked, it first sends the following PW status code 0x00000018 
   (Local PSN-facing PW Receive/Transmit Faults) to T-PE2. Note that the 
   same PW status code will be sent for all PWs associated with the MPLS

Internet-Draft      draft-boutros-pwe3-ms-pw-tp-00.txt        July 2010 
    

   LSP being locked out. PW status code is sent over PW OAM message or 
   LDP message depending on whether the segment PW2 is static or 
   dynamic. After sending the PW status code to T-PE2, S-PE lock the 
   MPLS-TP LSP and sends a positive LI reply to T-PE1. If the MPLS-TP 
   LSP cannot be locked, S-PE sends a negative LI reply with the 
   appropriate error code to T-PE1.  

   When T-PE2 receives the PW status codes, it processes them as 
   described in [3] or [4] depending on whether PW2 is dynamic or 
   static. 

   If PW2 is a dynamic segment and does not support PW status, S-PE 
   needs to withdraw its labels from T-PE2 before locking the MPLS LSP. 

   For better scalability, S-PE may use the notion of group ID described 
   in [6] to send PW status or withdraw labels all impacted dynamic PWs 
   between itself and T-PE2. Use of group ID with PW status OAM over 
   static PW is TBD (Sami: Check).  

3.1.1.2. LI originated at S-PE 

   Let's assume that an operator wants to originate an LI request at S-
   PE for the MPLS-TP LSP carrying PW1. The intended recipient of the LI 
   request is T-PE1. First, S-PE sends PW status code 0x00000018 (Local 
   PSN-facing PW Receive/Transmit Fault) for PW2 as well as all other 
   PWs pinned down to MPLS-TP LSP in question to T-PE2. PW status code 
   is sent over PW OAM message or LDP message depending on whether the 
   segment PW2 is static or dynamic. When T-PE2 receives the PW status 
   codes, it processes them as described in [3] or [4] respectively 
   depending on whether PW2 is dynamic or static. It then sends LI 
   request message to T-PE1. If T-PE1 can successfully lock the MPLS 
   LSP, it sends a positive LI response. Upon receiving the response, S-
   PE1 assumes that the MPLS-TP LSP is locked, and PW1 is no longer used 
   for carrying regular user data. 

   If T-PE1 is unable to lock the MPLS-TP LSP, it sends a negative LI 
   response with the appropriate error code. In this case, S-PE sends PW 
   status 0x00000000 to T-PE2 so that services on PW2 can resume. 

   If PW2 is a dynamic segment and PW status, S-PE needs to withdraw its 
   labels from T-PE2 before sending LI request to T-PE1. 

   For better scalability, S-PE may use the notion of group ID described 
   in [6] to send PW status or withdraw labels all impacted dynamic PWs. 
   Use of group ID with PW status OAM over static PW is TBD.

3.1.2. Locking PW 

   A given PW can also be taken out of service for maintenance operation 
   without impacting services over other PWs using the LI mechanism 
   described in [5]. 

3.1.2.1. LI originated at T-PE 

   In our example, let's assume that, T-PE1 sends an LI request message 
   to lock PW1. If S-PE is the intended recipient (based on the TTL 
   value of the PW label) and if it is able to lock PW1, it sends a PW 
   status message with the status code 0x00000018 (Local PSN-facing PW 
   Receive/Transmit Fault) over PW2 to T-PE2, and locks PW1. S-PE then 
   sends a positive LI reply to T-PE1. Upon receiving the positive LI 
   reply, T-PE locks PW1. If S-PE is unable to lock PW1, it sends a 
   negative LI reply to T-PE1. PW status code is sent over PW OAM 
   message or LDP message depending on whether the segment PW2 is static 
   or dynamic. When T-PE2 receives the PW status codes, it processes 
   them as described in [3] or [4] depending on whether PW2 is dynamic 
   or static. 

   If T-PE2 is the intended recipient of the LI message (in this case S-
   PE is a MIP), and if T-PE2 is able to lock PW2, it locks PW2 and 
   sends a positive LI response to T-PE1. If T-PE2 is unable to lock 
   PW2, it sends a negative LI response to T-PE1. Note that TTL value of 
   the PW label in the LI response should be chosen (e.g., 255) such 
   that the LI response will not be intercepted and processed by any 
   node other than T-PE1.   

3.2. Loopback Operation 

   As described in [5], an MPLS-TP LSP or a PW can be setup to in 
   loopback mode for management purpose, e.g., to test or verify 
   connectivity of the LSP/PW up to a specific node on the path of the 
   MPLS-TP tunnel/PW, to test the LSP/PW performance with respect to 
   delay/jitter, etc. But, prior to operating in loopback mode, an MPLS-
   TP LSP or PW must be successfully locked. 

3.2.1. Loopback at MPLS-TP LSP Level 

   Assume that an operator wants to operate an MPLS-TP LSP between T-PE1 
   and S-PE carrying PW1 in loopback mode such that S-PE loops all the 
   incoming packets over the MPLS-TP LSP back to the sender (in this 
   case T-PE1). 

   T-PE1 sends an LB request message which is received by S-PE. S-PE can 
   setup the MPLS-TP LSP only if all the PWs carried over that LSP can 
 
 
Boutros                Expires January 5, 2011                 [Page 6] 
                                                     
Internet-Draft      draft-boutros-pwe3-ms-pw-tp-00.txt        July 2010 
    

   be setup in loopback mode. If S-PE can setup the MPLS-TP tunnel in 
   loopback mode, it sends a positive LB response. Otherwise, it sends a 
   negative LB response to T-PE1.  

   If the MPLS-TP LSP is successfully setup in loopback mode, all 
   incoming packets over PW1 will be looped back to T-PE1. This is also 
   true for any other PW(s) between T-PE1 and S-PE pinned down to the 
   MPLS-TP LSP in question. 

   Similarly, MPLS-TP LSP between S-PE and T-PE1 can be operated in 
   loopback mode such that T-PE1 loops all incoming packets over the LSP 
   back to S-PE. In this case, S-PE and T-PE1 respectively are sender 
   and receiver of the LB request message.  

   The loopback operation can as well be between T-PE1 and T-PE2, in 
   this case PW2 and all PWs pinned down over the MPLS-TP LSP (that 
   received the LB request) will be programmed to loopback traffic back 
   to T-PE1. 

3.2.2. Loopback at PW Level 

   A SS-PW or MS-PW can be operated in loopback mode. 

   In our example, let's assume that PW1 is to be operated in a loopback 
   mode such that S-PE loops all incoming packets over PW1 back to T-
   PE1. To setup this mode of operation, T-PE1 sends an LB request 
   message to S-PE. TTL value of the PW label is chosen so as to expire 
   on the intended recipient (in our example TTL value should be 1 so 
   that LB request can be processed at S-PE). If S-PE can successfully 
   setup PW1 in loopback mode, it sends a positive LB response to T-PE1.   

   If loopback operation over the entire MS-PW (i.e., over PW1 and PW2) 
   such that T-PE2 loops all the incoming packets over PW2 back to T-
   PE1, T-PE1 and T-PE2 will be the sender and receiver of LB message.  

3.3. Switching Point PE TLV 

   Switching Point PE TLV (S-PE TLV) is used to record information about 
   S-PE(s) that a PW traverses. An S-PE TLV contains many sub-TLVs as 
   described in [3]. One such sub-TLV carries the FEC of the last 
   traversed PW segment defined for FEC129.  

   In the case of MS-PW containing static PW segment(s), if the last 
   traversed PW segment is statically provisioned, a new sub-TLV 
   containing the FEC defined for static PW in [7] can be used to 
   represent the last traversed PW segment. The new sub-TLV type will be 
   defined in [4].

   published by third parties, including those that are translated into 
   other languages, should not be considered to be definitive versions 
   of IETF Documents. The definitive version of these Legal Provisions 
   is that published by, or under the auspices of, the IETF. Versions of 
   these Legal Provisions that are published by third parties, including 
   those that are translated into other languages, should not be 
   considered to be definitive versions of these Legal Provisions. 

   For the avoidance of doubt, each Contributor to the UETF Standards 
   Process licenses each Contribution that he or she makes as part of 
   the IETF Standards Process to the IETF Trust pursuant to the 
   provisions of RFC 5378. No language to the contrary, or terms, 
   conditions or rights that differ from or are inconsistent with the 
   rights and licenses granted under RFC 5378, shall have any effect and 
   shall be null and void, whether published or posted by such 
   Contributor, or included with or in such Contribution.
