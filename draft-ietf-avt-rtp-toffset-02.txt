Abstract

   This document describes a method to inform RTP clients when RTP
   packets are transmitted at a time other than their 'nominal'
   transmission time.  It also provides a mechanism to provide improved
   inter-arrival jitter reports from the clients, that take into account
   the reported transmission times.

Internet-Draft          RTP Transmission Offsets            October 2006


1.  Introduction

   In the RTP specification [RFC3550] it is implied that packets are
   transmitted essentially in accordance with their RTP timestamps.
   This must be true, of course, on average over longer time intervals,
   as the client is playing the packets out according to those
   timestamps.  However, for individual packets, this may under some
   circumstances not be true:

   o  When the data rate of the stream is bursty, such as with video
      where I-frames may be significantly larger than P or B frames,
      traffic smoothing may need to be applied to maintain an
      appropriate data rate.

   o  In video which has forward decode dependencies, frames may need to
      be transmitted in decoding order (the sequence number order) but
      with, of course, presentation timestamps.  Under these
      circumstances the transmission time of a frame sent early in
      sequence does not correspond to its RTP timestamp.

   o  When re-transmissions are sent, the re-transmitted packet clearly
      has a different actual transmission time from the original, even
      though they share the same timestamp.

   Under some circumstances it can help the receiver, or intermediate
   network elements, to know the actual transmission time of the packet.
   This RTP header extension element allows the communication of this
   information.

   It can also be of use to report the inter-arrival jitter caused by
   the network, excluding that introduced by the source.  A new RTCP
   packet is defined to enable this reporting.

3.  Transmission offset

   Classically a pair of RTP packets with timestamps R2 and R1 are
   transmitted with a time interval between them of (R2 - R1).  This
   specification permits sending an offset value O in each packet, O1
   and O2.  One characteristic of these offsets is that the original
   transmission interval can be deduced to be (R2 + O2) - (R1 + O1).

   More precisely, the offset is defined as follows (with the function
   RtoN converting from RTP to NTP times, and NtoR doing the reverse):

   o  Take an RTP stream that has a recent RTCP sender report relating
      RTP timestamp R0 to NTP timestamp N0;

   o  consider a packet sent after that with RTP timestamp R1.
      Nominally this is sent at N1 = (N0 + RtoN(R1 - R0));

   o  If it was actually sent at a different time, Na, then the offset
      value is NtoR(Na - N1).

   The transmission time is signalled to the receiver in-band using The
   IETF Generic RTP header extension [hdrext].  The payload of this
   extension (the transmitted value) is a 24-bit signed integer.  When
   added to the RTP timestamp of the packet, it represents the
   "effective" RTP transmission time of the packet, on the RTP
   timescale.

   The form of the transmission offset extension block is as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  ID   | len=2 |              transmission offset              |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The length field takes the value 2 to indicate that 3 bytes follow.

   The sign of the offset value depends greatly on the choice of the
   initial mapping of RTP to NTP times.  In general, without scanning a
   stream entirely it is not possible to ensure that this mapping would
   keep all the offsets positive; therefore this specification allows
   negative values.

   In a stream where this extension is not in effect (i.e. not declared
   or negotiated), the actual transmission offset is therefore unknown.
   However, when the extension is in effect for the stream, it may be
   omitted in those packets for which the offset is 0 (zero); that is,



Singer & Desineni        Expires April 14, 2007                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft          RTP Transmission Offsets            October 2006


   packets sent at their nominal time do not need this extension
   tagging.  Therefore the implied transmission time of an un-tagged RTP
   packet depends on whether the extension is in effect for the stream
   (and therefore the transmission offset is 0) or not (whereupon the
   transmission offset is unknown).

   The jitter calculations performed by an RTP client MUST NOT use these
   transmission offsets.  In general, the sender (or intermediate
   network elements doing RTP analysis) cannot always know whether the
   offsets have been taken into account or not, and for consistency
   therefore, the jitter calculation should continue to operate on the
   'raw' reception times.  However, see the section on extended jitter
   reports, below.

   There are no extension attributes defined for this extension.

   It is structurally possible to have more than one extension of the
   same type in a packet.  However, this extension is only defined for
   the source to report, and intermediate network nodes that are not the
   source of the RTP session MUST NOT add this extension (whether or not
   it was previously present) and MUST NOT alter the existing
   transmission offset value in a packet, if the extension is already
   present.

   (Of course, it is clear that network elements that terminate an RTP
   flow, and are the source for a new RTP flow, can add a transmission
   offset extension header to the RTP packets of the new flow, if
   desired.)

4.  Extended Jitter Reports

   The inter arrival jitter computed as defined in Sec 6.4.1 of RFC3550
   provides inter-arrival jitter reports which include any source-
   introduced jitter (transmission time offsets).  If it is desired to
   indicate the actual network jitter, excluding the source-introduced
   jitter, the new RTCP packet type defined here may be used.  This new
   RTCP packet may be placed after the reception report inside a
   compound RTCP packet.

   It has the following form:

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   hdr |V=2|P|    RC   |   PT=IJ=195   |             length            |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                      interarrival jitter                      |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       .                                                               .
       .                                                               .
       .                                                               .
       |                      interarrival jitter                      |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   This RTCP packet must be placed after a receiver report (inside a
   compound RTCP packet), and MUST have the same value as the receiver
   report for RC.  The content is exactly that number of interarrival
   jitter calculations, calculated using the same formula as for sender
   and receiver reports, but taking into account the transmission
   offsets for the streams (if any).  (If no transmission offset
   information is given for a stream, then the value of interarrival
   jitter in this packet and in the receiver report will be identical).

6.  Security Considerations

   The given transmission offsets are only informative and it is hard to
   see security considerations from associating them with media streams.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The RTCP packet type used for the adjusted interarrival jitter needs
   to be registered, in accordance with section 15 of [RFC3550].  The
   abbreviation is "IJ", the full name is "Extended inter-arrival jitter
   report", the suggested value is 195, and the specification is this
   document.

8.  RFC Editor Considerations

   The reference to an Internet Draft needs to be updated to the RFC
   when it is published (which should be before this draft).

   The RFC number of this document needs to replace XXXX in the text
   above, before publication.
