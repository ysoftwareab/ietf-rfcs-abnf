                 ALTO Extension: Path Vector Cost Mode
                   draft-yang-alto-path-vector-03.txt

Abstract

   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Service has defined
   network and cost maps to provide basic network information, where the
   cost maps allow only scalar (numerical or ordinal) cost mode values.
   This document introduces a new cost mode called path-vector to allow
   ALTO clients to support use cases such as capacity regions for
   applications.  This document starts with a non-normative example
   called multi-flow scheduling (or capacity region) to illustrate that
   ALTO cost maps without path vectors cannot provide sufficient
   information.  This document then defines path-vector as a new cost
   mode.

1.  Introduction

   The ALTO base protocol [RFC7285] is designed for a setting of
   exposing network topology using the extreme "my-Internet-view"
   representation, which abstracts a whole network as a single node that
   has a set of access ports, with each port connects to a set of
   endhosts.  This "single-node" abstraction is simple and can support a
   wide range of applications already.

   A problem of this abstraction, however, is that it does not provide
   sufficient information for use cases that require exposure of
   topology information beyond the single-node abstraction, for example,

Internet-Draft         ALTO Extension: Path Vector             July 2016


   when there is a need to detect sharing of resources in the underlying
   topology (see an example in Section 3).

   This document goes beyond the single-node topology by introducing
   path vector as a new ALTO cost mode, where each path vector specifies
   abstracted network elements on the routing paths of a set of flows.
   Since the network elements on a path vector are abstract network
   elements defined by ALTO servers, the new path-vector cost mode
   provides a mechanism to allow a network to control the level of
   topology exposure, and at the same time better support application
   traffic optimization.  The design of path vector is based on the ALTO
   WG discussions at IETF 89, with summary slides at
   http://tools.ietf.org/agenda/89/slides/slides-89-alto-2.pdf.

   The organization of this document is organized as follows.  Section 2
   gives a non-normative example called multi-flow scheduling to
   illustrate the need to introduce path vectors.  Sections 3-6 specify
   the path vector cost mode for query, response, announcements, and
   incremental udpates, respectively.  Sections 7 and 8 discuss security
   and IANA considerations.

2.  Example: Capacity Region for Multi-Flow Scheduling

   Consider the case that routing is given.  Then what application-layer
   traffic optimization will focus on is traffic scheduling among
   application-layer paths.  Specifically, assume that an application
   has control over a set of flows F = {f1, f2, ..., f_|F|}. If routing
   is given, what the application can control is x1, x2, ..., x_|F|,
   where xi is the amount of traffic for flow i.  Let x = [x1, ...,
   x_|F|] be the vector of the flow traffic amounts.  Due to shared
   links, feasible values of x where link capacities are not exceeded
   can be a complex polytope.

   Specifically, consider a network as shown in Figure 1.  The network
   has 7 switches (sw1 to sw7) forming a dumb-bell topology.  Switches
   sw1/sw3 provide access on one side, s2/s4 provide access on the other
   side, and sw5-sw7 form the backbone.  Endhosts eh1 to eh4 are
   connected to access switches sw1 to sw4 respectively.  Assume that
   the bandwidth of each link is 100 Mbps.

             Figure 2: Base Single-Node Topology Abstraction.

   Consider an application overlay (e.g., a large data analysis system)
   which needs to schedule the traffic among a set of endhost source-
   destination pairs, say eh1 -> eh2, and eh3 -> eh4.  The application
   can request a cost map providing end-to-end available bandwidth,
   using 'available bw' as cost-metric and 'numerical' as cost-mode.

   Assume that the application receives from the cost map that both eh1
   -> eh2 and eh3 -> eh4 have bandwidth 100 Mbps.  It cannot determine
   that if it schedules the two flows together, whether it will obtain a
   total of 100 Mbps or 200 Mbps.  This depends on whether the routing
   paths of the two flows share a bottleneck in the underlying topology:

   o  Case 1: If eh1 -> eh2 and eh3 -> eh4 use different paths, for
      example, when the first uses sw1 -> sw5 -> sw7 -> sw2, and the

Internet-Draft         ALTO Extension: Path Vector             July 2016


      second uses sw3 -> sw5 -> sw6 -> sw7 -> sw4.  Then the application
      will obtain 200 Mbps.

   o  Case 2: If eh1 -> eh2 and eh3 -> eh4 share a bottleneck, for
      example, when both use the direct link sw5 -> sw7, then the
      application will obtain only 100 Mbps.

   To allow applications to distinguish the two aforementioned cases,
   the network needs to provide more details.  The path vector extension
   defined in this document resolves this issue.

   See [I-D.bernstein-alto-topo] for a survey of use-cases where
   extended network topology information is needed.

3.  Path-Vector Query

   Since the key motivation of providing path vectors is for concurrent-
   flow settings, due to sharing of network resources, the specification
   is for a multi-flow setting.  Also, instead of defining such queries
   separately for grouping of endhosts (PIDs) and individual endpoints,
   we define for generic sources, destinations.

     {
       "cost-type" : {"cost-mode":   "path-vector",
                      "cost-metric": "bw"}
       },
       "flows" : [
         {"src": "ipv4:192.0.1.1", "dst": "ipv4:192.0.1.2"},

         {"src": "ipv4:192.0.1.1", "dst": "ipv4:192.0.1.4"}
       ]
     }



4.  Path-Vector Response

   An extension supporting the path-vector cost-mode MUST support the
   following extension of Section 11.2.3.6 of [RFC7285]:

     object {
       cost-map.DstCosts.JSONValue -> JSONString<0,*>;
       meta.cost-mode = "path-vector";
     } InfoResourcePVCostMap : InfoResourceCostMap;



   Specifically, the preceding specifies that InfoResourcePVCostMap
   extends InfoResourceCostMap.  The body specifies that the first
   extension is achieved by changing the type of JSONValue defined in
   DstCosts of cost-map to be an array of JSONString; the second
   extension is that the cost-mode of meta MUST be "path-vector".

   An example cost map using path-vector is the following:

             "tag": "c0ce023b8678a7b9ec00324673b98e54656d1f6d"
           }
           "cost-type" : {"cost-mode":   "path-vector",
                          "cost-metric": "bw"
           }
         }
       },

       "cost-map" : {
         "ipv4:192.0.1.1": {
                   "ipv4:192.0.1.2":    ["ne57"],
                   "ipv4:192.0.1.4":    ["ne57", "ne74"]
         },
         "ipv4:192.0.1.3": {
                   "ipv4:192.0.1.4":    ["ne56", "ne67"]
         }
       }

       "nep-map" : {
         "ne57" : {"bw" : 100},
         "ne74" : {"bw" : 100},
         "ne56" : {"bw" : 100},
         "ne67" : {"bw" : 100}
       }
     }


   To interpret the path vectors in a cost map, an ALTO client will need
   access to the properties of the abstract network elements named in
   the path vectors.  One approach is to use a network element property
   service (e.g., the unified properties draft
   [I-D.roome-alto-unified-props]).  In this design, they are included
   as a second map in the same message, for consistency and saving of
   round-trips.

5.  Path-Vector in IRD

   Announcing the support of path vector in IRD is relatively
   straightforard: the mode is included as the IRD.

Internet-Draft         ALTO Extension: Path Vector             July 2016


6.  Path-Vector in Incremental Updates

   A concern is whether the design allows efficient incremental updates,
   on either the path vectors of the element properties.  For this
   design, the keys along the data path allow such easy encoding.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document has not conducted its security analysis.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires the definition of a new cost-mode named path-
   vector.
