      Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
      months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other
      documents at any time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-

Abstract

   This document discusses methods available for LDAP clients to
   discover the existance and location of LDAP servers. It is based on
   previous and ongoing IETF work.

1. Introduction

   The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [1] can be used to
   build "islands" of servers that are not a priori tied into a single
   Directory Information Tree (DIT.) Here, it is necessary to determine
   how a client can discover LDAP servers. This documents discusses the
   methods

2. Client Discovery of LDAP Servers

   To discover LDAP servers, clients should follow the sequence of steps
   specified in [1] (which uses DNS [2] and the Service Location

   Protocol [3]) with the target service being LDAP.  If a DNS record is
   found for a name that begins with ldap (i.e. ldap.tcp.foo.com or
   ldap.foo.com) a further DNS lookup for a TXT record under that name
   would return the root of that server's subtree.   If a client
   supports DHCP, it may use the DHCP extension specified in [4] to
   locate LDAP servers.

   Alternatively, LDAP clients may have a list of preconfigured LDAP
   servers included with them that a user can select from.  Here, some
   of the servers in the preconfigured list might provide the
   functionality described in this document, to allow for simpler
   clients.

3. Security Considerations

   Since this draft only summarizes available methods, it adds no
   additional security considerations to those inherent in the
   referenced documents.  Implementors are strongly recommended to read
   and follow the security considerations provided in the referenced
   documents.
