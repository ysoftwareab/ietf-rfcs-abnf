2.  Introduction

   This document presents the home control and automation application
   specific requirements for Routing in Low power and Lossy Networks
   (RL2N).  In a modern home, a high number of wireless devices are used
   for a wide set of purposes.  Examples include lighting control
   modules, heating control panels, light sensors, temperature sensors,
   gas/water leak detector, motion detectors, video surveillance,
   healthcare systems and advanced remote controls.  Basic home control
   modules such as wall switches and plug-in modules may be turned into
   an advanced home automation solution via the use of an IP-enabled
   application responding to events generated by wall switches, motion
   sensors, light sensors, rain sensors, and so on.

   Because such devices only cover a limited radio range, multi-hop
   routing is often required.  These devices are usually highly
   constrained in term of resources such as battery and memory and
   operate in unstable environments.  Persons moving around in a house,
   opening or closing a door or starting a microwave oven affect

   reception of weak radio signals.  Reflection and absorption may cause
   a reliable connection to turn unreliable for a period of time and
   then being reusable again, thus the term "lossy".

   Unlike other categories of RL2N, the connected home area is very much
   consumer-oriented.  The implications on network nodes in this aspect,
   is that devices are very cost sensitive, which leads to resource-
   constrained environments having slow CPUs and small memory
   footprints.  At the same time, nodes have to physically small which
   puts a limit to the physical size of the battery; and thus, the
   battery capacity.  As a result, it is common for low-power sensor-
   style nodes to shut down radio and CPU resources for most of the
   time.  Often, the radio uses almost just as much power for listening
   as for transmitting.

   Section 3 describes a few typical use cases for home automation
   applications.  Section 4 discusses the routing requirements for
   networks comprising such constrained devices in a home network
   environment.  These requirements may be overlapping requirements
   derived from other application-specific requirements documents or as
   listed in [I-D.culler-rl2n-routing-reqs].


3.  Home automation applications

   Home automation applications represent a special segment of networked
   wireless devices with its unique set of requirements.  To facilitate
   the requirements discussion in Section 4, this section lists a few
   typical use cases of home automation applications.  New applications
   are being developed at a high pace and this section does not mean to
   be exhaustive.  Most home automation applications tend to be running
   some kind of command/response protocol.  The command may come from
   several places.  For instance a lamp may be turned on, not only be a
   wall switch but also from a movement sensor.

3.1.  Turning off the house

   Using the direct analogy to an electronic car key, a house owner may
   activate the "leaving home" function from an electronic house key,
   mobile phone, etc.  For the sake of visual impression, all lights
   should turn off at the same time.  At least, it should appear to
   happen at the same time.  A well-known problem in wireless home
   automation is the "popcorn effect": Lamps are turned on one at a
   time, at a rate so slow that it is clearly visible.  Obviously, this
   mostly apply to very low bandwidth RF systems.  Some existing home
   automation solutions use a clever mix of a "subnet groupcast" message
   with no acknowledgement and no forwarding before sending acknowledged
   singlecast messages to each lighting device.  Broadcast packets

Internet-Draft   draft-brandt-rl2n-home-routing-reqs-02    November 2007


   cannot be used for this since some lights should stay on.  The light
   controller forms the groups and decides which light modules should
   receive "turn-off" or "turn-on" requests.  Thus, traditional IP
   multicast cannot be used for such applications, since multicast
   relies on the recivers to subscribe to multicasted streams.

3.2.  Moving a remote control around

   A remote control is a typical example of a mobile device in a home
   automation network.  An advanced remote control may be used for
   dimming the light in the dining room while eating and later on,
   turning up the music while doing the dishes in the kitchen.  Reaction
   must appear to be instant (within a few hundred milliseconds) even
   when the remote control has moved to a new location.  The remote
   control may be communicating to either a central home automation
   controller or directly to the lamps and the media center.  The
   routing protocol MUST support multiple paths.  The routing protocol
   MUST be able to locate a working path within 250ms, given that a
   working path exists and it has been used before.

3.3.  Adding a new lamp module to the system

   Small-size, low-cost modules may have no user interface except for a
   single button.  Thus, an automated inclusion process is needed for
   light controllers to find new modules.  The routing protocol MUST
   support re-discovery of neighbors when a new device is added to the
   network.  The routing protocol MAY scan for neighbors on a frequent
   basis.  This scanning process MUST NOT use significant network
   bandwidth resources.

3.4.  Controlling battery operated window shades

   In consumer premises, window shades are often battery-powered as
   there is no access to mains power over the windows.  For battery
   conservation purposes, the receiver is sleeping most of the time.  A
   home automation controller sending commands to window shades via RL2N
   resources will have no problems delivering the packet to the router,
   but the router will have to wait for some time before the command can
   be delivered to the window shades; e.g. up to 250ms.

3.5.  Networked smoke alarm

   Many smoke alarms are battery powered and at the same time mounted in
   a high place.  Battery-powered safety devices should only be used for
   routing if no other alternatives exist.  A smoke alarm with a drained
   battery does not provide a lot of safety.  Also, it may be
   inconvenient to exchange battery in a smoke alarm.  Finally, routing
   via battery-powered nodes may be very slow if they are sleeping most

   of the time .

3.6.  Remote video surveillance

   Remote video surveillance is a fairly classic application for Home
   networking providing the ability for the end user to get a video
   stream from a Web Cam reached via the Internet, which can either be
   triggered by the end-user that has received an alarm from a movement
   sensor, smoke detector or that simply wants to check the home status
   via video.  Note that in the former case, more than likely, there
   will be a form of inter-device communication: indeed, upon detecting
   some movement in the home, the movement sensor may send a request to
   the light controller to turn-on the lights, to the Web Cam to start a
   video stream that would then be directed to the end user (cell phone,
   PDA) via the Internet.  By contrast with other application where for
   example a large number of L2N devices such as industrial sensors
   where the data would mainly be originated by sensor to a sink and
   vice versa, in such scenario there is a direct inter-device
   communication between L2N devices.

3.7.  Healthcare

3.8.  Alarm systems

   This section will be documented in further revision of this document.


4.  Unique requirements of home automation applications

   Home automation applications have a number of specific requirements
   related to the set of home networking applications and the perceived
   operation of the system.

4.1.  Support of groupcast

   Some home automation systems require low-level addressing of a group
   of nodes in the same subnet without any prior creation of multicast
   groups, simply carrying a list of recipients in the subnet.

   The routing protocol MUST support multicast routing with various
   scopes: local subnet, all devices.  In other words, the routing
   protocol MUST provide the ability to route a packet toward a single
   device (unicast), a set of devices (also referred to as "groupcast"
   in this document) or all devices (multicast) in the house.

   The support of unicast, groupcast and multicast also has an

Internet-Draft   draft-brandt-rl2n-home-routing-reqs-02    November 2007


   implication on the addressing scheme and are outside the scope of
   this document that focusses on the routing requirements aspects.

   Note: with IP Multicast, signalling mechanisms are used by a
   receivers to join a group and the sender does not necessarily know
   the receivers of the group.  What is required is the ability to
   address a group of receivers known by the sender even if the
   receivers do not need to know that they have been grouped by the
   sender (requesting each individual node to join a multicast group
   would be very impractical).

4.2.  Node constrained Routing

   Simple battery-powered nodes such as movement sensors on garage doors
   and rain meters may not be able to assist in routing.  Depending on
   the node type, the node never listens at all, listens rarely or makes
   contact on demand to a pre-configured target node.  Attempting to
   communicate to such nodes may require long time before getting a
   response.

   Other battery-powered node may have the capability to participate to
   the routing protocol but it may be preferable to choose a
   (potentially longer) route via non battery powered devices or via
   battery powered that have more energy.

   The routing protocol MUST support constrained based routing taking
   into account node properties (CPU, memory, level of energy, sleep
   intervals, safety/convenience of changing battery).

4.3.  Support of Mobility

   In a home environment, although the majority of devices are fixed
   devices, there is still a variety of mobile devices: for example a
   multi-purpose remote control is likely to move.  Another example of
   mobile devices is wearable healthcare devices.

   The routing protocol MUST provide mobility with convergence time
   within a few hundred milli-seconds.

4.4.  Scalability

   Looking at the number of wall switches, power outlets, sensor of
   various nature, video equipment and so on in a modern house, it seems
   quite realistic that hundreds of low power devices may form a home
   automation network in a fully populated "smart" home.  Moving towards
   professional building automation, the number of such devices may be
   in the order of several thousands.




Brandt & Vasseur          Expires May 15, 2008                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft   draft-brandt-rl2n-home-routing-reqs-02    November 2007


   Thus the routing protocol MUST be highly scalable supporting a large
   number of devices (at least a few hundreds of devices).

4.5.  Convergence Time

   Home automation is clearly an L2N subject to various instability due
   to signal strength variation.  Furthermore, as the number of (battery
   powered) devices increases, the probability of node failures also
   increases.  In all cases, response time of the order of a few
   hundreds of milliseconds are required, implying that the routing
   protocol MUST converge (provide alternate routes upon link or node
   failure) within a few hundreds of milliseconds.

4.6.  Manageability

   The ability of the home network to support auto-configuration is of
   the utmost importance.  Indeed, most end users will not have the
   expertise and the skills to perform advanced configuration and
   troubleshooting.  Thus the routing protocol designed for home L2N
   MUST provide a set of features including 0 configuration of the
   routing protocol for a new node to be added to the network.

   Furthermore, a misbehaving node MUST NOT have a global impact on the
   routing protocol.  The routing protocol SHOULD support the ability to
   isolate a misbehaving node thus preserving the correct operation of
   overall network.


5.  Traffic pattern

   Depending on the philosophy of the home network, wall switches may be
   configured to directly control individual lamps or alternatively, all
   wall switches send control commands to a central lighting control
   computer which again sends out control commands to relevant light
   devices.  In a distributed system, the traffic tends to be any-to-
   many.  In a centralized system, it is a mix of any-to-one and one-to-
   many.

   A centralized system may benefit from a tree topology routing
   strategy; having the central light controller close to the root.

   A tree topology may prove inefficient for nodes in a distributed
   system.  A direct path from sender to receiver may be significantly
   shorter than a path following the tree.  A shorter path means lower
   latency and less air-time use in a wireless media.  Thus, routers
   MUST provide efficient any-to-many routing and MUST also support any-
   to-any routing without having to transit via a central point (e.g.
   tree root) which would unavoidably lead to sub-optimal path in term
