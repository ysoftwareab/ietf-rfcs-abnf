Internet-Draft  Mobility Management in a SIP Environment       July 2001


   communication services and SIP is gaining widespread acceptance as
   the signaling protocol for multimedia applications on the Internet.
   Thus, it is essential to develop a mobility management scheme that
   utilizes salient features and capabilities of SIP as well as other
   protocols (e.g., mobile IP) to support mobile services efficiently.
   Without providing any specific solution, this document presents
   preliminary requirements and identifies the issues that need to be
   resolved in order to develop a mobility management scheme for
   supporting multimedia applications in a SIP signaling and control
   environment.

1. Purpose and Scope

   The increasing demand for mobile telephony, and the explosive growth
   of the Internet are driving forces behind the current boom in the
   communication industry. On the one hand, mobile wireless telephony is
   rapidly becoming ubiquitous. The difference between the prices of
   mobile and fixed telephone services is diminishing and users demand
   for continuous connectivity is on the rise. Thus, mobility is rapidly
   becoming a rule rather than an exception, and mobile wireless
   applications and appliances are becoming predominant. Several
   technical forums (e.g., 3GPP, 3GPP2, and MWIF) that are working on
   the specifications of a mobile wireless Internet have chosen SIP as
   the basic session management protocol.  On the other hand,
   service/network providers/operators are rapidly expanding their IP
   infrastructure to support the explosive growth of the data traffic of
   the Internet users. The growth of data service market is much faster
   than that of telephony, and providers will invest much more in
   expanding the IP infrastructure than in expanding PSTN. Due to this
   lop-sided growth of the IP infrastructure, it is reasonable to expect
   that mobile and fixed Internet telephony will initially complement
   the 1G/2G mobile and PSTN services in the near future and will
   inevitably displace them in a much longer term. Since SIP [1] is
   gaining acceptance as the signaling protocol of multimedia and
   Internet telephony, it is essential to develop a mechanism for
   supporting multimedia mobile applications in a SIP signaling and
   control environment.

   The key objectives of this document are to

   ** describe the frame work requirements for mobility management in
      general, as well as the mobility management functions and
      requirements in particular,

   ** identify open issues involved in supporting application of roaming
      users in a SIP signaling and control environment, and

   ** include the relevant issues in the agenda of the SIP WG and/or

      other appropriate WGs in the IETF.

   This document is organized as follows: Section 2 provides the overview
   of the end-to-end wireless/wireline IP infrastructure of a mobile Internet.
   In Section 3, we define the terminal, service and personal aspects of
   mobility.  Section 4 includes the general system requirements and
   considerations for mobility management. Section 5 focuses on necessary
   functions for supporting mobility as well as their requirements.
   Section 6 identifies some of the open issues involved in supporting
   roaming users in a SIP environment, and Section 7 summarizes the document.

2. Architecture of a Mobile Internet

   We envision that all services, real-time and non-real-time will
   eventually migrate onto a mobile Internet. The users have IP
   stationary or mobile appliances and use end-to-end IP transport and
   signaling/control from user terminal to user terminal including possible
   use of IP transport and control on the air interface.

   Figure 1 depicts the end-to-end packet platform of a mobile Internet
   which comprises all IP wireless access networks and a packet switched
   IP backbone network. The IP backbone network is an end-to-end wireline
   IP infrastructure that will comprise regional providers' wireline IP
   networks that are connected through the wireline Internet. Besides mobile
   stations/terminals, a wireless access network also comprises a radio
   access network (RAN), and an edge router and controller (ERC) [2]. In order
   to support the needs of its users, a wireless access network interacts
   with the network control entities that are shown as Domain Control
   Agent (DCA) in Figure 1. What follows is a brief description of these
   elements and their functions.

2.1. Mobile Station (MS)

   It is the user mobile terminal that allows users to communicate,
   and also provides means of interactions and control between users
   and the network.

2.2. Radio Access Network (RAN)

   The radio access network (RAN) represents the wireless and
   back-haul infrastructure that provides MSs with wireless access to
   the wireline infrastructure. A RAN usually comprises a set of base
   stations and base station controllers. In IMT-2000 [3, 4], RANs
   use  programmable software radios to provide flexibility  across
   frequency bands at the MS and across the RAN. It is desirable to
   remain  independent from  the underlying RAN technology  and  to
   minimize the restriction (or requirements) that it places on (or
   expects from) a RAN.

2.3. Edge Router & Controller (ERC)

   An ERC is a routing and control system that connects a wireless
   access network to a regional wireline IP network. Although Figure 1
   depicts one RAN per ERC, in practice, each ERC may support several
   RANs. An ERC  comprises two functional entities, an edge router
   (ER) and an edge control agent (ECA). The ER is an IP router,
   while the ECA is an intelligent agent that interacts with the
   domain control agent (DCA) to control the RANs as well as support
   necessary network-wide control tasks. In the IP parlance, each ERC
   is the default gateway of all IP MSs that are supported by RANs
   that are connected to it.

2.4. Domain Control Agent (DCA)

   The domain control agent (DCA) provides session management as well
   as means for interaction between users and network control system
   and interaction among network control entities. Furthermore, the
   DCA also supports: (1) Mobility management, (2) Authentication,
   Authorization, and Accounting (AAA), and (3) QoS management, in
   summary MAAAQ, functions for mobile users. These functional
   entities usually reside on the wireline backbone, and are part of
   the overall control system of the end-to-end platform. As Figure 1
   indicates the home and visited DCA entities may either interact
   directly or via a third party Inter-Domain Control Agent (IDCA) on
   the global Internet. In the latter case, the IDCA entity serves as
   a trusted broker between the home and visiting network DCAs.

       Figure 1. Architecture of a mobile Internet


   As shown in Figure 1, DCA entity of the mobile wireless/wireless IP
   network is built around SIP [1]. It comprises comprises SIP servers
   and agents, MAAAQ entities, and SIP registrars.  All MSs and fixed
   hosts have SIP user agents that provide means of interactions with
   the SIP servers (i.e., proxy servers, redirect servers, and registrar)
   within the network.  In Figure 1, the SIP server entity of each DCA
   represents the set of SIP proxies and SIP redirect servers within a
   regional IP network. Similarly, the registrar represents the server
   (or set of servers) that accepts (accept) SIP REGISTER requests and

Internet-Draft  Mobility Management in a SIP Environment       July 2001


   provides (provide) necessary functions, similar to those of the
   home/visiting location registries (HLR/VLR) in today's wireless
   telephony to roaming users. As Figure 1 shows the MAAAQ entity
   uses SIP features and capabilities to support roaming users.  The
   illustration of the MAAAQ entities and SIP server as a single module in
   Figure 1 should not be interpreted as a requirement for having a
   centralized SIP server or MAAAQ entity per regional network. Figure 1
   only shows the required functions, though each of the SIP and MAAAQ
   entities comprise a set of distributed agents. Similarly, the SIP
   registrars (i.e., HR, VR, and IDR) may be implemented as either
   central or distributed databases.

   The remainder of this document focuses primarily on the requirements,
   functions, and issues that arise in supporting roaming users in such
   an IP wireless-wireline infrastructure.

3. Different Facets of Mobility: Definitions

   In principle a mobility management protocol provides means of terminal,
   session and service, and personal mobility, where:

   1. Terminal Mobility: refers to an end user's ability to use her/his
      own terminal in any location and the ability of the network to
      maintain the user's ongoing communication as she/he roams across
      radio cells within the same subnet, subnets within the same
      administrative and or different administrative domains.

   2. Service Mobility: refers to the end user's ability to maintain
      ongoing sessions and obtain services in a transparent manner.
      For instance, the user of a mobile terminal should be able to
      move a specific session to a laptop/DSL terminal without losing
      the session. The service mobility includes the ability of the
      home service provider to either maintain control the services it
      provides to the user in the visited network or transfer their
      control to the visited network.

   3. Personal Mobility: refers to the ability of end users to originate
      and receive calls and access subscribed network services on any
      terminal in any location in a transparent manner, and the ability
      of the network to identify end users as they move across
      administrative domains.

4. Framework Requirements for Mobility Management

   In general, the mobility management scheme of wireless IP networks
   satisfies the following requirements [2, 5].

      I. It supports means of personal, service, and terminal mobility,



ITSUMO Group                                                    [Page 6]

Internet-Draft  Mobility Management in a SIP Environment       July 2001


         i.e., it allows users continue their ongoing communication and
         to access the network services anywhere using their own mobile
         terminal/station (referred to as the mobile station or simply
         MS, hereafter).

     II. It supports global roaming, i.e., it should allow users
         to roam across different technology platforms, and across
         subnets within the same administrative domain as well as across
         subnets that belong to different administrative domains.

    III. It is wireless "technology-independent", i.e., it should
         remain independent of the underlying wireless technology.
         This requirement allows the ISPs and network operators to
         upgrade their sub-systems independently and build multi-vendor
         solutions. Furthermore, this requirement ensures that the
         mobility management scheme can be transported over all members
         of the IMT-2000 family which comprises several wireless
         technologies such as W-CDMA, TDMA, etc. [3, 4].

     IV. It supports both real-time and non-real-time multimedia
         services such as mobile telephony, mobile web access, and mobile
         data services in a way that their prices and performance are
         comparable to those of their counterparts in today's mobile
         voice and data services. In order to do so, the mobility
         management scheme should interact effectively with the QoS management
         and authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) schemes
         of the end-to-end network to verify the users' identities and rights,
         as well as to ensure that the QoS requirements of applications
         are satisfied and maintained as users roam around.

      V. It transparently supports current TCP-based Internet application.
         It should support TCP as is without requiring any changes to TCP
         protocol or TCP-based applications, i.e., it should spoof/maintain
         constant end-points for TCP connections.

     VI. It allows a mobile station/user to decide whether it conveys its
         location to correspondent hosts or not. This requirement allows
         users to enhance their confidentiality and privacy, when necessary.

    VII. It supports multicast and anycast trees efficiently as mobile
         stations/users move around.

   VIII. Last but not least, it interworks smoothly with PSTN and today's
         1G/2G wireless telephony to facilitate interworking of new operators'
         all IP platforms with PSTN and the existing 1G/2G wireless telephony [5].


5. Mobility Management Functions and Requirements

Internet-Draft  Mobility Management in a SIP Environment       July 2001


   Simply speaking, a roaming MS should be able to receive (and send)
   calls/data from (and to) anyone in any place, and maintain its
   ongoing communications with others with minimal (if any at all) QoS
   degradation regardless of its point of attachment to the network.
   In order to achieve this goal, the mobility management scheme shall
   support hand-off, registration, configuration, dynamic address
   binding, and location management whenever necessary. The remainder
   of this section describes these functions as well as their performance
   requirements in more detail.

5.1 Hand-off

   Hand-off (or handover) is a process that allows a established
   call/session to continue when a MS moves from one cell to another
   (intercell) or between radio channels in the same cell (intracell)
   without interruptions in the call/session. The hand-off process can
   be either hard or soft. In the hard hand-off the mobile receives and
   accepts only one radio signal from a radio channel or base station
   within a single cell.  As the mobile moves into a new cell, its signal
   is abruptly handed over from its current cell (or base station) to the
   new one rapidly in a few seconds.

   With soft hand-off the MS continues to receive and accept radio
   signals from the base stations within its previous as well as its new
   cell for a limited period of time. Signal reception from the old base
   station ceases when the signal strength drops/reduces below a certain
   threshold. As its name indicates, soft hand-off smoothly transfers the
   MS's session from its old base station to the new one.  All third
   generation CDMA wireless technologies use soft hand-off. The soft
   hand-off process can take a relatively long period (i.e., several seconds),
   particularly, when it includes the entire process of pilot strength
   measurement, issuing of pilot strength measurement message (PSMM) on
   the uplink, and addition of new pilot to active set. In principle,
   soft hand-off is NOT always a transient process, and may take a long
   time depending on MS's request and requirements.

   In order to take advantage of the soft hand-off feature of the third
   generation CDMA wireless technologies in mobile IP packet networks,
   during the soft hand-off period, the packets which are destined for
   a MS shall be routed to both its previous and current locations.
   This routing of packets to the current and previous locations of a
   MS constitutes a logical/virtual soft hand-off at the IP layer.

   The hard hand-off process should take only a few second, while the soft
   hand-off process can take much longer (i.e., about several seconds).
   Nevertheless, in order to ensure the wireless "technology independence"
   requirement of mobility management schemes, we require a maximum acceptable
   hand-off time (MAHT) a few seconds (i.e., MAHT = 2-3 seconds). This

Internet-Draft  Mobility Management in a SIP Environment       July 2001


   requirement is acceptable for both hard and soft hand-off mechanisms,
   though it can be relieved significantly in the case of soft hand-off.


   We identify three levels of logical/virtual hand-off: cell, subnet, and
   domain.


   a. Cell hand-off (or micro-mobility): It allows a MS to move from a cell
      to another in a subnet within an administrative domain.

   b. Subnet hand-off (or macro-mobility): It allows a MS to move from a cell
      within a subnet to an adjacent cell within another subnet that belongs
      to the same administrative domain.

   c. Domain hand-off (or global mobility): It allows a MS to move from one
      subnet within an administrative domain to another in a different
      administrative domain.


In general, the cell hand-off is more frequent than subnet hand-off and subnet
   hand-off is more frequent than the domain hand-off. The hand-off process is
   built upon the registration, configuration, dynamic address binding, and
   location management functions. Hand-off process is transparent to users
   and satisfies the following requirements.


     i. All three hand-off processes ensure the integrity, privacy and
        confidentiality of users' information as well as prevent fraud and
        theft of service. They

         -  ensure the security of signaling (e.g., registration) messages to
            prevent eavesdropping and theft of users' data and service
            profiles as well as maintain confidentiality of users' locations,
            and

         -  perform the necessary AAA process to verify users' identities and
            their rights to requested resources, and ensure correct and
            non-repudiatable accounting.

    ii. All three hand-off processes strive ensure service mobility as the MS
        roams around. In order to do so, they strive to

         a.  maintain the QoS of ongoing sessions, when mandatory, through
             minimizing the loss of transient data during the hand-off,
             as well as satisfying the delay requirements of real-time
             applications as a MS roams around, and




ITSUMO Group                                                    [Page 9]

Internet-Draft  Mobility Management in a SIP Environment       July 2001


         b.  ensure that MS has access to all of its subscribed network services
             and features (e.g., pre-paid services) regardless of its point of
             attachement.

   iii. The domain hand-off latency should not exceed MAHT to ensure continuity
        of real-time sessions.

    iv. The subnet hand-off latency shall not exceed MAHT, though it should be
        much less than domain hand-off latency because it does not usually
        involve AAA process.

   A few points are worth noting. First, the domain hand-off process is
   functionally equivalent to the sum of subnet hand-off and AAA processes.

   Second, the domain hand-off latency is the sum of the registration,
   configuration, and address binding latencies, while location management
   process can be performed after (or concurrent with) the hand-off. Let
   us use a qualitative and intuitive discussion to estimate rough upper
   bounds of the registration and configuration latencies. Let us assume that
   processing delay is negligible, and the upper bound on the soft hand-off
   latency, MAHT is about 2-3 seconds.  The address binding latency is at
   most an end-to-end (source - destination - source) round trip queueing and
   propagation delay. The round trip propagation delay for continental U.S.
   is about 50 ms (i.e., New Seattle - Miami - Seattle). Assuming an address
   binding delay of 1 second, we are left with less than 1-2 seconds
   for both registration and configuration delays. The goal is to get the
   configuration latency down to millisecond (e.g., a few hundred milliseconds,
   and bounded mostly by the speed of the access link) [12].  Thus, with soft
   hand-off registration latency shall not exceed 1-2 seconds. The preceding
   back of the envelop calculation indicates that that registration and
   configuration should take roughly 1-2 seconds though thorough measurements
   are needed to establish precise upper bounds on the registration and
   configuration latencies.

   Third, in order to satisfy the "wireless-independence" and global roaming
   requirements, the hand-off processes minimize their reliance on the
   link layer.  To achieve this goal, the subnet and domain hand-off processes
   remain completely independent from the link layer, while the cell hand-off
   (i.e., micro-mobility) strives to minimize its dependence on the link layer
   specifications.

5.2 Registration

   Registration is a process by which a network becomes aware of the existence
   and the location of an MS and its associated user. When an MS becomes active
   (i.e., is turned on) in a network or roams into a new subnet or domain, it
   shall register with the network. This process comprises sending a
   registration request from the MS to the network, and performing an AAA



ITSUMO Group                                                   [Page 10]

Internet-Draft  Mobility Management in a SIP Environment       July 2001


   (i.e., authentication, authorization, and accounting) process by the network,
   and sending appropriate responses to the MS as well as location management
   entities to ensure that the network is aware of MS's current location.
   There are two types of registration, complete and expedited (or partial).

   a. Complete Registration: This process occurs when a user turn on its MS
      or roams into a new administrative domain (i.e., during domain hand-off).
      In this case, the network shall perform AAA, and send appropriate
      responses to the MS and location management entities.

   b. Expedited/Partial Registration: This process is invoked when a user
      moves from one subnet to another within the same administrative domain
      (i.e., subnet hand-off). It does not include AAA process of complete
      registration, and its main objective is to keep the location information
      up to date.

   The complete registration process should not take more than 1-2 seconds
   to be performed. The expedited registration process usually takes much less
   than the complete registration process.

5.3 Configuration

   Configuration is a process by which a MS updates its IP address as it roams
   between subnets either within the same administrative domain or in different
   administrative domains. As an MS moves between subnets (either within the
   same domain or in different ones), it needs to acquire a new IP address,
   possibly new default gateway, subnet mask, etc. as well, and to reconfigure
   itself accordingly.

   The key requirements of the reconfiguration process are that it

   ** should not take more than a few hundred milliseconds to complete, and

   ** should update the DNS to reflect the current address to name and name
      to address mappings [18, 19], if necessary.

   The latter is necessary when the MS is a server for a protocol, and also
   ensures that the new TCP connections are established using MS's current
   address.  If the underlying wireless platform supports soft hand-off,
   the reconfiguration process can take more time. However, a few hundred
   milliseconds upper bound should be acceptable for both soft hand-off
   and hard hand-off.

5.4 Dynamic Address Binding

   Dynamic address binding is a process for allowing an MS to maintain a
   constant identifier (e.g., a constant URL) regardless of its point of
   attachment to the network (e.g., its IP address).  Dynamic address



ITSUMO Group                                                   [Page 11]

Internet-Draft  Mobility Management in a SIP Environment       July 2001


   binding

   ** allows a user to maintain a universal identifier (e.g., a SIP URL)
      regardless of its point of attachment to the network (e.g., its IP
      address), and

   ** facilitates support of TCP-based applications by informing each endpoint
      about the current address of the other one.

   Needless to say that required signaling for dynamic address binding should
   be secure to ensure privacy and location confidentiality and protect users
   against fraud.

5.5 Location Management

   Location management is a process by which the network updates the location
   database and supports location/redirect services to authorized users and
   authorities. The location service is essential only for new inbound sessions.
   Key requirements of location management are accuracy, being up to date,
   and confidentiality of the location information. The location information

   ** should be up to date and accurate, e.g., the domain name service shall
      ensure correct name to address and/or address to name mapping as soon
      as possible, and

   ** should only be disclosed to authorized users and relevant authorities
      within the scope of the law.

5.6 Required Functions for Cell, Subnet, and Domain Hand-off

   of hand-off, cell, subnet and domain.

Internet-Draft  Mobility Management in a SIP Environment       July 2001


6. Issues in Supporting Mobility in a SIP Environment

   Having described mobility management and its requirements, let us identify
   a preliminary list of open issues that arise in supporting these
   requirements in a SIP control environment for further study.

6.1 Supporting macro and global mobility for multimedia applications
    of roaming users

   In principle, mobile IP [7, 8] provides means of macro and global mobility
   for non-real-time services. It provides means of terminal mobility as well
   as dynamic address assignment using network access identifier (NAI).
   However, mobile IP by itself does not provide means of personal mobility
   and location service. Furthermore, the impact of the triangular routing (in
   classic mobile IP) and route optimization scheme on the QoS requirements
   of real-time services requires further study. Different approaches such as
   either coexistence of SIP and mobile IP [7, 13], or the development of
   a new SIP based mobility management protocol [10, and references therein]
   have been proposed.  However, the interaction and harmonization of mobile
   IP with the SIP signaling scheme of real-time services requires further
   study to determine the best approach for combining the salient features of
   mobile IP terminal mobility with those of the SIP personal mobility.
   Such an approach should

   ** spoof constant endpoints for TCP connections and support TCP as is
      without any modification to TCP protocol or TCP-based applications,
      and

   ** require RTP [14] applications to accept packets with the same
      synchronization source (SSRC) but different source IP address.

6.2 Complete registration in less than a few seconds

   Registration in a mobile environment has two objectives, informing
   the network about the MS (or user) and its location, and verifying
   the MS identity and services that the MS is entitled to. Using SIP
   REGISTER method, one can adequately achieve the former in the MS's
   home network. However, the latter is an essential required function
   that allows MSs to roam among different administrative domains. One
   can conceive several alternatives for performing complete registration.

   One alternative is that the MS utilizes a separate protocol such as
   DRCP [12] or mobile IP [7] to register with the network, and then
   uses the SIP REGISTER method to register with a SIP registrar that
   provides location service as well. In this case, the registration
   process places no additional requirements on SIP.

   Another alternative is the SIP registration process [11] that uses SIP



ITSUMO Group                                                   [Page 13]

Internet-Draft  Mobility Management in a SIP Environment       July 2001


   REGISTER method and possible interactions of SIP registrars of different
   domains with one another through the AAA entities of the home and
   visited networks to verify a user's identity and rights and grant or
   or deny the registration.  In this case, SIP proxies should be
   able to interact with the unified AAA infrastucture (including its
   policy repository and profile databases) of a mobile wireless Internet
   that is shared among all of its protocols.  Thus, there should be some
   agreements on the interface between SIP proxies and the AAA infrastructure
   of a mobile wireless Internet. Moreover, though NOT necessarily a SIP
   issue, it essential to have a fast and scalable AAA mechanism for
   wide area networks that can authenticate and authorize a MS and its
   user in less than a few seconds.  See Basilier, et al. [17] for
   further details on AAA requirements and constraints.

6.3 Reconfiguration in fractions of a second

   This requirement is an important one. It does not seem to impose any
   requirements on SIP, however, it places significant requirements on
   DHCP. As the MS roams into a new subnet or a new administrative domain,
   it may need to acquire a new address before being able to register.
   In order to do so, the MS interacts with DHCP [6] to obtain a new IP
   address, and reconfigure itself. Currently, due to its collision
   detection procedure, it takes DHCP several seconds to reconfigure a
   host. This latency is usually too much for mobile users. Different
   schemes such as fast DHCP that does not perform conflict resolution,
   and or novel schemes such as dynamic registration and configuration
   (DRCP) [12] have been proposed to reduce the reconfiguration delay of
   a MS. Moreover, DHCP may need to interact with DNS and update it
   dynamically so that the name to address mappings remain current.
   Further study is needed to arrive at appropriate solutions for these
   issues. The rationale for the dynamic updating of DNS is to ensure
   that new non-SIP (e.g., TCP) in-bound sessions are established with
   correct and current address of the MS.


6.4 Providing location service

   As the MS roams around it should update its location so that authorized
   users can direct their new calls/sessions the MS's current location.
   Among the approaches for providing location service are

    a. the dynamic update of the DNS, and

    b. the development of a brand new protocol that allows applications
       to use SIP registrar for name to address and address to name
       mappings.

   Neither of these approaches seems to have any impact on SIP specifications,



ITSUMO Group                                                   [Page 14]

Internet-Draft  Mobility Management in a SIP Environment       July 2001


   though the latter should be built upon the SIP specifications and use
   SIP methods.

6.5 Supporting the soft hand-off procedure

   The third generation CDMA wireless technologies all support soft hand-off
   procedure which allows a roaming MS to receive and accept signals from
   both its new base station as well the old one simultaneously during the
   soft hand-off period (about several seconds). In order to utilize this
   feature the macro and global mobility scheme shall emulate a virtual soft
   hand-off at the IP layer via forwarding the session's packets to the old
   as well as the new location of the MS during the soft hand-off. Since the
   correct realization of the soft hand-off procedure in IP-centric environments
   is complex, some have suggested not to use it in IP wireless networks [15].
   However, we believe supporting soft-hand-off is essential because it
   improves the capacity and performance of CDMA wireless networks. We have
   developed a virtual soft hand-off scheme [16] that uses SIP to extend the
   ongoing session to the new location of the MS, and drop the old location
   after a limited period of time. The performance - complexity trade-off of
   the proposed virtual soft hand-off schemes requires further study.

6.6 Providing secure signaling for mobile users

   Due to the ease of "wire-tapping" in a wireless environment, the signaling
   and user data should be encrypted to ensure privacy and confidentiality of
   users and protect them against fraud and theft of service. SIP messages can
   already be encrypted. Nevertheless, the SIP WG has chartered a task force to
   identify and address issues (e.g., key management) that arise in enhancing
   SIP security mechanisms. This task force should address security issues
   in the context of wireline as well as wireless networks.

7. Summary and Conclusions

   This document focused on supporting mobility in a SIP signaling and
   control environment. It identified the functions, requirements, and
   open issues so that they are included in the agenda of the SIP WG as
   well as other appropriate WGs of IETF in a timely manner.
