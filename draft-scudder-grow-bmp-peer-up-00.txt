                     BMP Peer Up Message Namespace
                 draft-scudder-grow-bmp-peer-up-00.txt

Abstract

   RFC 7854, BMP, uses different message types for different purposes.
   Most of these are Type, Length, Value (TLV) structured.  One message
   type, the Peer Up message, lacks a set of TLVs defined for its use,
   instead sharing a namespace with the Initiation message.  Subsequent
   experience has shown that this namespace sharing was a mistake, as it
   hampers the extension of the protocol.

   This document updates RFC 7854 by creating an independent namespace
   for the Peer Up message.  The changes in this document are formal
   only, compliant implementations of RFC 7854 also comply with this
   specification.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7854] defines a number of different BMP message types.  With the
   exception of the Route Monitoring message type, these messages are
   TLV-structured.  Most message types have distinct namespaces and IANA
   registries.  However, the namespace of the Peer Up message overlaps
   that of the Initiation message.  As the BMP protocol has been
   extended, this oversight has become problematic.  In this document,
   we create a distinct namespace for the Peer Up message to eliminate
   this overlap, and create the corresponding missing registry.

   The changes in this document are formal only, compliant
   implementations of [RFC7854] also comply with this specification.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  String Definition

   A string TLV is a free-form sequence of UTF-8 characters whose length
   is given by the TLV's Length field.  There is no requirement to
   terminate the string with a null (or any other particular) character
   -- the Length field gives its termination.

3.  Changes to RFC 7854

   We update [RFC7854] as follows:

   o  The "Information TLV" of section 4.4, that was shared between the
      Initiation and Peer Up message types, is renamed as the
      "Initiation Information TLV", and is only relevant to the
      Initiation message type.

   o  A "Peer Up Information TLV" is defined, and is relevant to the
      Peer Up message type.

   o  A "Peer Up TLVs" registry is created, seeded with the Peer Up
      Information TLV.

   Other than as summarized above, and detailed below, there are no
   other changes.

3.1.  Revision to Information TLV, Renamed as Initiation Information TLV

   The Information TLV defined in section 4.4 of [RFC7854] is renamed
   "Initiation Information TLV".  It is used only by the Initiation
   message, not by the Peer Up message.

   The definition of Type = 0 is revised to be:

   o  Type = 0: String.  The Information field contains a string
      (Section 2).  The value is administratively assigned.  If multiple
      strings are included, their ordering MUST be preserved when they
      are reported.

3.2.  Revision to Peer Up Notification

   The final paragraph of section 4.10 of [RFC7854] references the
   Information TLV (which is revised above (Section 3.1)).  That
   paragraph is replaced by the following:

   o  Information: Information about the peer, using the Peer Up
      Information TLV format defined below (Section 3.3).  The String
      type may be repeated.  Inclusion of the Information field is

      OPTIONAL.  Its presence or absence can be inferred by inspection
      of the Message Length in the common header.

3.3.  Definition of Peer Up Information TLV

   The Peer Up Information TLV is used by the Peer Up message.

     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

   o  Information Type (2 bytes): Type of information provided.  Defined
      types are:

      *  Type = 0: String.  The Information field contains a string
         (Section 2).  The value is administratively assigned.  If
         multiple strings are included, their ordering MUST be preserved
         when they are reported.

   o  Information Length (2 bytes): The length of the following
      Information field, in bytes.

   o  Information (variable): Information about the monitored router,
      according to the type.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to create a registry within the BMP group, named
   "BMP Peer Up Message TLVs", reference this document.

   Registration procedures for this registry are:

                +-------------+--------------------------+
                |    Range    | Registration Procedures  |
                +-------------+--------------------------+
                |   0-32767   |     Standards Action     |
                | 32768-65530 | First Come, First Served |
                | 65531-65534 |       Experimental       |
                |    65535    |         Reserved         |
                +-------------+--------------------------+

   Initial values for this registry are:

5.  Security Considerations

   This rearrangement of deck chairs does not change the underlying
   security issues inherent in the existing [RFC7854].
