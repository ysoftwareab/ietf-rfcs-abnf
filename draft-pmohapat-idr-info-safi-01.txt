Abstract

   This document specifies a new BGP SAFI, Encapsulation SAFI. A BGP
   update message of this SAFI contains an NLRI which uniquely
   identifies the BGP speaker that originated the update. The purpose of
   such an update is to carry attributes that define how encapsulated
   packets need to be delivered to the sender. For instance, if one BGP
   speaker needs to use an IP-based encapsulation in order to deliver
   traffic to a second, the second BGP speaker can use this SAFI to
   specify information about the encapsulation header that it expects. A
   BGP tunnel encapsulation attribute is specified for this purpose.

1. Specification of requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2. Introduction

   This document specifies a new BGP SAFI, Encapsulation SAFI. A BGP
   update message of this SAFI contains an NLRI which uniquely
   identifies the BGP speaker that originated the update. The purpose of
   such an update is to carry attributes that define how encapsulated
   packets need to be delivered to the sender. For instance, if one BGP
   speaker needs to use an IP-based encapsulation in order to deliver
   traffic to a second, the second BGP speaker can use this SAFI to
   specify information about the encapsulation header that it expects. A
   BGP tunnel encapsulation attribute is specified for this purpose.
   Other attributes, including communities and/or extended communities,

Internet Draft    draft-pmohapat-idr-info-safi-01.txt      February 2007


   can also be included.  The tunnel attribute is especially useful for
   multipoint-to-point tunnels to signal information from the receiving
   speaker to transmitting speakers.

   One application of the SAFI and the tunnel encapsulation attribute is
   [SOFTWIRE] that specifies a requirement to connect IPv4 networks
   across IPv6 core and IPv6 networks across IPv4 core.

   The motivation behind introducing the new SAFI to send information
   about the speaker is to advertise such information once, or as and
   when it changes as opposed to attaching this information with each
   and every prefix. That would require advertising redundant
   information, and also, when the information changes, the speaker
   would require to send all the prefixes again resulting in a network-
   wide control plane churn.

   The advantage of using the same SAFI to distribute encapsulation
   information of different tunneling technologies is that the route
   reflectors need not be upgraded each time there is a new
   encapsulation protocol deployed in the network and also the edge
   routers can send or receive encapsulation parameters for multiple
   types over one BGP session. The tunnel encapsulation attribute is
   optional transitive, thus a BGP speaker can transparently pass on the
   information even if it does not support it.


3. Encapsulation NLRI Format

   The BGP speaker identification is advertised in BGP UPDATE messages
   using MP_REACH_NLRI and MP_UNREACH_NLRI attributes [RFC4760]. The
   Encapsulation SAFI (value to be assigned by IANA) is set as the SAFI
   value in these UPDATE messages. The AFI is set to be one of the
   address family identifier values as defined in [IANA-AF] (refer to
   the Address Family Numbers section).

   The NLRI in the MP_REACH_NLRI or MP_UNREACH_NLRI is a variable length
   field encoded in a format as defined in section 5 of [RFC4760] (a 2-
   tuple of the form <length, value>). The value field is structured as
   follows:












Mohapatra & Rosen                                               [Page 3]

Internet Draft    draft-pmohapat-idr-info-safi-01.txt      February 2007


            +-----------------------------------------------+
            |       Endpoint address (Variable)             |
            +-----------------------------------------------+

     - Endpoint Address: This field identifies the BGP speaker
       originating the update. It is typically one of the interface
       addresses configured at the router. The length of the endpoint
       address is dependent on the AFI being advertised. For example, if
       the AFI is set to IPv4 (1), the the endpoint address is a 4-octet
       IPv4 address whereas if the AFI is set to IPv6 (2), the endpoint
       address is a 16-octet IPv6 address.

   An update message that carries the MP_REACH_NLRI or MP_UNREACH_NLRI
   with Encapsulation SAFI MUST also carry the BGP mandatory attributes:
   ORIGIN, AS_PATH, and LOCAL_PREF (for IBGP neighbors) as defined in
   [RFC4271]. In addition, such an update message can also contain any
   of the BGP optional attributes, like Community or Extended Community
   attribute to influence an action on the receiving speaker.

   When a BGP speaker advertises the Encapsulation NLRI via BGP, it uses
   its own address as the BGP nexthop in the MP_REACH_NLRI or
   MP_UNREACH_NLRI attribute. The nexthop address is set based on the
   AFI in the attribute.  For example, if the AFI is set to IPv4 (1),
   the nexthop is encoded as a 4-byte IPv4 address. If the AFI is set to
   IPv6 (2), the nexthop is encoded as a 16-byte IPv6 address of the
   router. On the receiving router, the BGP nexthop of such an update
   message is validated by performing a recursive route lookup operation
   in the routing table.

   Bestpath selection of Encapsulation NLRIs is governed by the decision
   process outlined in section 9.1 of [RFC4271]. The encapsulation data
   carried through other attributes in the message are to be used by the
   receiving router only if the NLRI has a bestpath.


4. Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute

   Tunnel Encapsulation attribute is an optional transitive attribute
   that is composed of a set of TLVs. The type code of the attribute is
   to be assigned by IANA. Each TLV contains information corresponding
   to a particular tunnel technology. The TLV is structured as follows:

   Tunnel Type (2 octets): It identifies the type of the tunneling
   technology being signaled. This document defines the following types:

     - L2TPv3: Tunnel Type = 1

     - GRE: Tunnel Type = 2

   Unknown types are to be ignored and skipped upon receipt.

   Length (2 octets): the total number of octets of the Value field.

   Value (variable): The value is comprised of multiple sub-TLV's. Each
   sub-TLV consists of three fields: a one-octet type, one-octet length,
   and zero or more octets of value. The sub-TLV is structured as
   follows:

                   +-----------------------------------+

   Sub-TLV Type (1 octet): Each sub-TLV type defines a certain property
   about the tunnel TLV that contains this sub-TLV. The following are
   the types defined in this document:

     - Encapsulation: sub-TLV type = 1

     - Protocol type: sub-TLV type = 2

   Unknown sub-TLV types are to be ignored and skipped upon receipt.

   Sub-TLV Length (1 octet): the total number of octets of the sub-TLV
   value field.

   Sub-TLV Value (variable): Encodings of the value field depend on the
   sub-TLV type as enumerated above. The following sub-sections define
   the encoding in detail.


4.1. Encapsulation sub-TLV

   The syntax and semantics of the encapsulation sub-TLV is determined
   by the tunnel type of the TLV that contains this sub-TLV.

   When the tunnel type of the TLV is L2TPv3, the following is the
   structure of the value field of the encapsulation sub-TLV:


       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                      Session ID (4 octets)                    |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                                                               |
      |                        Cookie (Variable)                      |
      |                                                               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


     * Session ID: a 4-octet value locally assigned by the advertising
       router that serves as a lookup key in the incoming packet's
       context.

     * Cookie: an optional, variable length (0 to 64 bits) value used by
       L2TPv3 to check the association of a received data message with
       the session identified by the Session ID. The Cookie value is
       tightly coupled with the Session ID.

       The length of the cookie is not encoded explicitly, but can be
       calculated as: (sub-TLV length - 4)

   When the tunnel type of the TLV is GRE, the following is the
   structure of the value field of the encapsulation sub-TLV:

       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                      GRE Key (4 octets)                       |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


     * GRE Key: A 4 Octet field that is generated by the advertising
       router.  The actual method by which the key is obtained is beyond
       the scope of the document. The key is inserted into the GRE
       encapsulation header of the payload packets sent by ingress
       routers to the advertising router. It is intended to be used for
       identifying extra context information about the received payload.

       Note that the key is optional. Unless a key value is being
       advertised, the GRE encapsulation sub-TLV MUST NOT be present.


4.2. Protocol Type sub-TLV

   The protocol type sub-TLV encodes the type of the payload packets
   that will be encapsulated with the tunnel parameters being signaled
   in the TLV. The value field of the sub-TLV contains a 2-octet
   protocol type that is one of the types defined in [IANA-AF] as ETHER
   TYPEs.

   As an example, if we want to use three L2TPv3 sessions, one carrying
   IPv4 packets, one carrying IPv6 packets, and one carrying MPLS
   packets, the egress router will include three TLVs of L2TPv3
   encapsulation type, each specifying a different session id and a
   different payload type. The protocol type sub-TLV for these will be
   IPv4 (protocol type = 0x0800), IPv6 (protocol type = 0x86dd), and
   MPLS (protocol type = 0x8847) respectively. This informs the ingress
   routers of the appropriate encapsulation information to use with each
   of the given protocol types. Insertion of the specified session id at
   the ingress routers allows the egress to process the incoming packets
   correctly, according to their protocol type.


4.3. Tunnel Type Selection

   A BGP speaker may include multiple tunnel TLVs in the tunnel
   attribute.  The receiving speaker MAY have local policies defined to
   choose different tunnel types for different sets/types of payload
   prefixes received from the same BGP speaker. For instance, if a BGP
   speaker includes both L2TPv3 and GRE tunnel types in the tunnel
   attribute and it also advertises IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes, the ingress
   router may have local policy defined to choose L2TPv3 for IPv4



Mohapatra & Rosen                                               [Page 7]

Internet Draft    draft-pmohapat-idr-info-safi-01.txt      February 2007


   prefixes (provided the protocol type received in the tunnel attribute
   matches) and GRE for IPv6 prefixes.

   Additionally, the Encapsulation SAFI UPDATE message can contain a
   community or extended-community as a way to color the corresponding
   tunnel TLV(s).  The same community or extended community can then be
   attached to the UPDATE messages that contain payload prefixes. This
   way, the BGP speaker can express the fact that it expects the packets
   corresponding to these payload prefixes to be received with a
   particular tunnel encapsulation header.

   In a multi-vendor deployment that has routers supporting different
   tunneling technologies, attaching community and/or extended-community
   to the Encapsulation SAFI UPDATE message can serve as a
   classification mechanism (for example, set A of routers for GRE and
   set B of routers for L2TPv3).  The ingress router can then choose the
   encapsulation data appropriately while sending packets to an egress
   router.

   These communities/extended communities, if used, will be user defined
   and configured locally on the routers.


5. Capability advertisement

   A BGP speaker that wishes to exchange tunnel endpoint information
   must use the Multiprotocol Extensions Capability Code as defined in
   [RFC4760], to advertise the corresponding (AFI, SAFI) pair.


6. Security Considerations

   If a third party is able to modify any of the information that is
   used to form encapsulation headers, or to choose a tunnel type, or to
   choose a particular tunnel for a particular payload type, user data
   packets may end up getting misrouted, misdelivered, and/or dropped.


7. IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new NLRI format, called Encapsulation NLRI,
   to be carried in BGP using multiprotocol extensions. It is to be
   assigned its own SAFI.

   This document defines a new BGP optional transitive attribute, called
   Tunnel attribute.

   This document introduces Tunnel TLVs and sub-TLVs. The type space for

Internet Draft    draft-pmohapat-idr-info-safi-01.txt      February 2007


   both of these should be set up by IANA as a registry of 2-octet
   tunnel types and 1-octet sub-TLV types. These should be assigned on a
   first-come- first-serve basis.
