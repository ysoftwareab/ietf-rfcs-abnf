<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>This memo proposes requirements for protocols between web identity providers and users and for requirements for protocols between identity providers and relying parties.  These requirements minimize the likelihood that  criminals will be able to gain the credentials necessary to impersonate a user or be able to fraudulently convince users to disclose personal information.  To meet these requirements browsers must change.  Websites must never receive information such as passwords  that can be used to impersonate the user to third parties.  Browsers  should perform mutual authentication and flag situations when the target website is not authorized to accept the identity being offered as this is a strong indication of fraud.    These requirements may serve as a basis for requirements for preventing fraud in  environments other than the web.

<a name="rfc.section.1"></a><h3>1.&nbsp;
Introduction</h3>

<p>Typically, web sites ask users to send a user name and
      password in order to log in and authenticate their identity to
      the website.  The user name and plaintext password are often sent
      over a TLS <a class='info' href='#RFC4346'>[RFC4346]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Dierks, T. and E. Rescorla, &ldquo;The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.1,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> encrypted connection.  As a
      result of this, the server learns the password and can pretend
      to be the user to any other system where the user has used the
      same user name and password. The security of passwords over TLS depends on
      making sure that the password is sent to the right, trusted
      server.  HTTPs <a class='info' href='#RFC2818'>[RFC2818]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rescorla, E., &ldquo;HTTP Over TLS,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a> implementations typically confirm that the name
      entered by the user in the URL corresponds to the certificate.  
</p>
<p>One serious security threat on the web today is phishing.
      Phishing is a form of fraud where an attacker convinces a user
      to provide confidential information to the attacker believing
      they are providing the information to a party they trust with
      that information.  For example, an email claiming to be from a
      user's bank may direct the user to go to a website and verify
      account information.  The attacker captures the user name and
      password and potentially other sensitive information.  Domain
      names that look like target websites, links in email, and many
      other factors contribute to phishers' ability to convince users
      to trust them.
</p>
<p>Typically the user names and password are not directly valuable to the phisher.  However  they can be used to access resources of value.  For example a bank password may permit money transfer or access to information useful in identity theft.  
</p>
<p>It is useful to distinguish two targets of phishing.
      Sometimes phishing is targeting web authentication credentials
      such as user name and password.  Sometimes phishing is targeting
      other confidential information, such as bank account numbers.  
      This memo presents requirements
      that can be part of a solution to significantly reduce the effectiveness of the first
      category of phishing: provided that a user uses an authentication mechanism that meets these requirements,  even if
      the user authenticates to the wrong server, that server cannot
      impersonate the user to a third party.  However, to combat
      phishing targeted at other confidential information, the best we
      know how to  do is help the user detect fraud before they release
      confidential information.
</p>
<p>The approach taken by this memo is to handle
      these two types of phishing differently.  The user is given new authentication mechanisms.  If the user uses these mechanisms,they have strong assurances that their password
   has not been disclosed and that the ensuing data returned from the
   server was generated by a party that either knows their password or
   who is authenticated by an identity provider who knows their
   password.  The server can then use confidential information
      known to the user and server to enhance the user's trust in
      its identity beyond what is available given the social
      engineering attacks against TLS server authentication.  If a
      user authenticates to  the wrong server but discovers
      this before they give that server any other confidential
      information, then there exposure is very limited.  The success of this solution depends heavily on whether the user uses the new authentication mechanisms; designing ways for users to tell if they are using the authentication mechanisms and encouraging users to use these mechanisms will be critical to achieving any security benefit from these requirements.  
</p>
<p>The requirements presented in this memo are intended to be useful to  browser designers, designers of other HTTP applications and designers of future HTTP authentication mechanisms.

<a name="rfc.section.1.1"></a><h3>1.1.&nbsp;
Purpose of this Memo</h3>

<p>In publishing this memo, the IETF recommends the development of web authentication mechanisms that meet the requirements outlined in <a class='info' href='#REQUIREMENTS'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Requirements for Preventing       Phishing</span><span>)</span></a>.  It is hoped that developing these mechanisms will prove a useful step in fighting phishing.  However this memo does not restrict work either in the IETF or any other organization.  In particular, new authentication efforts are not bound to meet the requirements posed in this memo unless the charter for those efforts chooses to make these binding requirements.  Less formally, the IETF presents this memo as an option to pursue while acknowledging that there may be other promising paths both now and in the future.

<a name="rfc.section.1.2"></a><h3>1.2.&nbsp;
Passwords and Interface</h3>

<p>There are two related concepts: the user interface of passwords and plaintext password protocols.  A plaintext password protocol is a protocol where the server receives credentials sufficient to impersonate a user  to third parties.   A password interface provides a user experience where a user types a password into any computer, including one they have never used before and that is sufficient to  authenticate.  The requirements in this memo require support for password user interfaces as one option for authentication.  The requirements of this memo are incompatible with plaintext password protocols.

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
Threat Model</h3>

<p>This section describes the assumed capabilities of phishers,
      describes assumptions about web security and describes what
      vulnerabilities exist.   Human factors issues contribute significantly to these vulnerabilities.  For example, security  information dialogues in web browsers  can provide information on the subject of a certificate.  However, users rarely examine this information, so an attacker could be successful even if examining the security dialogue would show an attack.  This threat model is intended to include these sorts of attacks and so it is broader than the technical threats against protocols.
</p>
<p> We assume  that the implementations of authentication systems can be trusted sufficiently to meet their design objectives.  This does not mean that the entire local system and browser need to be trusted.  However  if there is a component that has access to users' passwords, that component needs to be secure enough to be trusted not to divulge passwords to attackers.  Similarly  in a system that used smart cards, the smart cards would need to be trusted not to give attackers access to private keys or other authentication material.  Designing implementations to limit the size and complexity of the most trusted components and to layer trust will be important to the security of implementations.  Designing protocols to enable good implementation will be critical to the utility of the protocols.  As a consequence of this assumption, these
      requirements are insufficient to provide protection against
      phishing if malicious browser extensions, Trojan software or
      other malicious software is installed into a sufficiently trusted part of the
      local computer or authentication tokens.  
</p>
<p>We
      assume that users have limited motivation to combat phishing.
      Users cannot be expected to read the source of web pages,
      understand how DNS works well enough to look out for spoofed
      domains, or understand URI encoding.  Users do not typically
      understand certificates and cannot make informed decisions about
      whether the subject name in a certificate corresponds to the
      entity they are attempting to communicate with.  As a consequence of this assumption, users will likely be fooled by strings either in website names or certificates that look visually similar but that are composed of different code points.    
</p>

<a name="rfc.section.3.1"></a><h3>3.1.&nbsp;
Capabilities of Attackers</h3>

<p>We assume attackers can convince the user to go to a website of their
	choosing.  Since the attacker controls the web site and since
	the user chose to go to the website  the TLS certificate will
	verify and the website will appear to be secure.  The
	certificate will typically not be issued to the entity the
	user thinks they are communicating with, but as discussed
	above, the user will not notice this.   
   Mechanisms attackers use to accomplish this include links with a
   misleading name or URI, which they may distribute in emails;
   attacks against DNS; and man-in-the-middle attacks against a TLS
   handshake.  The former two attacks allow the attacker to pass
   authentication because the victim user can be tricked into
   accepting the attacker's certificate.  The latter attack will
   typically create a warning on the victim user's side, but many
   users do not  make informed decisions on how to respond to such a
   warning, making them inclined to accept the bogus certificate.

</p>
<p>The attacker can convincingly replicate any part of the UI
	of the website being spoofed.  The attacker can also spoof
	trust markers such as the security lock, URL bar and other
	parts of the browser UI sufficiently that a significant class of users will not treat the spoofed security indicators as a problem.  There is one limitation to the
	attacker's ability to replicate UI.  The attacker cannot
	replicate a UI that depends on information the attacker does
	not know.  For example, an attacker could generally replicate
	the UI of a banking site's login page.  However the attacker
	probably could not replicate the account summary page until
	the attacker  learned the user name and password because the attacker would not know what accounts to list or approximate balances that will look convincing to a user.  Of course attackers may know some personal information about a user.  Websites that want to rely on attackers not knowing certain information need to maintain the privacy of that information.
</p>
<p>It's not clear how valuable this limitation on the attacker's ability will prove in practice.  Research into the effectiveness of security indicators <a class='info' href='#SECIND'>[SECIND]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schechter , S., Dhamija , R., Ozment, A., and I. Fischer, &ldquo;The Emperor's New Security Indicators: An evaluation of        website authentication and the effect of role playing on usability        studies,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> suggests that users do not pay attention to security indicators.  One difference between the security indicators tested in today's research and using private information to detect fraud is that the private information may be directly related to the task the user is trying to perform.  However the attacker can attempt to come up with a convincing explanation such as a partial outage or system upgrade  for why the private information is not available.  
</p>
<p>The attacker can convince the user to do anything with the
	phishing site that they would do with the real target site.
	As a consequence, when passwords are used, if we want to avoid
	the user giving the attacker their password, the web site must
	prove that it has an established authentic relationship with
	the user without requiring a plaintext password protocol.
	One approach could be to transition to a solution
	where the user could  not give the real target site their
	password if they are using a new mechanism.  Instead they will need to cryptographically prove
	that they know their password without revealing it.

Attacks of Interest</h3>

<p>The ultimate goal of these requirements is to provide protection against disclosure of confidential information to unintended parties.  These requirements focus on two such disclosures and handle them separately.  The first category is disclosure of credentials that could allow an unintended party to impersonate the user, possibly gaining access to additional confidential information.  The second attack is disclosure of confidential information not directly related to authentication.  The second class of attack cannot be directly defeated, but we can give information to users that they could use to help  know when they are communicating with an unintended party.
</p>
<p> Note that some authentication systems such as
	Kerberos <a class='info' href='#RFC4120'>[RFC4120]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Neuman, C., Yu, T., Hartman, S., and K. Raeburn, &ldquo;The Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5),&rdquo; July&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> provide a facility to
	delegate the ability to act as the user to the target of the
	authentication.  Such a facility when used with an
	inappropriately trusted target would be an instance of the first class of 
	attack.  Solutions to these requirements with similar facilities MUST discuss  the security considerations surrounding use of these facilities.  
</p>
<p>Of less serious concerns at the present time are attacks on
	data integrity where a phisher provides false or misleading
	information to a user.

Requirements for Preventing
      Phishing</h3>

<p>This section describes requirements for web authentication
      solutions.  These solutions are intended to prevent phishing
      targeted at obtaining web authentication credentials.  These
      requirements will make it more difficult for phishers to target
      other confidential information.
</p>
<p>The requirements discussed here are similar to the principles
      outlined in "Limits to Anti-Phishing" <a class='info' href='#ANTIPHISHING'>[ANTIPHISHING]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nelson, J. and D. Jeske, &ldquo;Limits to Anti Phishing,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>.  Most of this work was discovered
      independently but work from that paper has been integrated where
      appropriate.  It is desirable that these requirements are similar to the principles outlined by someone facing phishing as an operational reality.

Support for Passwords and OTher Methods</h3>

<p>The web authentication solution MUST support passwords and
	MUST be secure even when passwords are commonly used.   In
	many environments, users need the ability to walk up to a
	computer they have never used before and log in to a website.
	 Carrying a smart card or USB token significantly increases
	the deployment cost of the website and decreases user
	convenience. The smart card is costly  to deploy because it requires a process for replacing smart cards, requires support staff to be trained in answering questions regarding smart cards and requires a smart card to be issued when an identity is issued.  Smart cards are less convenient because users cannot gain access to protected resources without having their card physically with them.  Many public access computers do not have smart cards available and do not provide access to USB ports; when they do they tend not to support smart cards.  It is important not to underestimate the training costs (either in money or user frustration) of teaching people used to remembering a user name and password about a new security technology.     Sites that aggregate identity--for example allowing a user to log into an identity provider and then gain access to other resources may be a significant part of a solution.  However we cannot assume that a given user will have only one such website: there are valid and common reasons a user (or the relying party) would not trust all identity information to one such site.  
</p>
<p>A solution to these requirements MUST also support smart cards and other authentication solutions.  Some environments have security requirements that are strong enough that passwords simply are not a viable option.  Many efforts are under way to reduce the deployment costs of token-based authentication mechanisms and to address some of the concerns that make passwords a requirement today.

<a name="rfc.section.4.2"></a><h3>4.2.&nbsp;
Trusted UI</h3>

<p>Users need the ability to trust components of the UI in
	order to know  that the UI is being presented  by a trusted
	component of the device.  The primary concern is to  make
	sure that the user knows  any  password is being given to
	trusted software rather than being filled into an HTML form
	element that will be sent to the server.
</p>
<p>There are three basic approaches to establishing a trusted
	UI.  The first is to use a dynamic UI based on a secret shared 
	by the user and the local UI; the paper <a class='info' href='#ANTIPHISHING'>[ANTIPHISHING]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nelson, J. and D. Jeske, &ldquo;Limits to Anti Phishing,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>
	recommends this approach.   A second approach is to provide a
	UI action  that highlights  trusted or non-trusted components
	in some way.  This could work similarly to the Expose  feature
	in Apple's OS X where a keystroke visually distinguishes
	structural elements of the UI.  Of course such a mechanism
	would only be useful if users actually used it.  Finally, the
	multi-level security community has extensive research in
	designing UIs  to display classified, compartmentalized
	information.  It is critical that these UIs be able to label
	information and that these labels not be spoofable.  
</p>
<p>See <a class='info' href='#SERVER'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Is it the right Server?</span><span>)</span></a> for another case where
	confidential information in a UI can be used to build trust.

<a name="rfc.section.4.3"></a><h3>4.3.&nbsp;
No Password Equivelents</h3>

<p>A critical requirement is that when a user authenticates to
	a website, the website MUST NOT receive a strong password
	equivalent  <a class='info' href='#IABAUTH'>[IABAUTH]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rescorla, E., &ldquo;A Survey of Authentication Mechanisms,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>.  A strong password equivalent is anything that  would
	allow a phisher to   authenticate as a user with a different
	identity provider.  Weak password equivalents  (quantities that act as a password for a given service  but cannot be reused with other services ) MAY only be
	sent when a new identity is being enrolled or a password is
	changed.  A weak password equivalent allows a party to
	authenticate to a given identity provider as the user.  
	
</p>
<p>There are two implications of this requirement.  First,
	a strong cryptographic authentication protocol needs to be used
	instead of sending the password  encrypted over TLS.   The
	zero-knowledge class of password protocols  such as those
	discussed in section 8 of the IAB authentication mechanisms
	document <a class='info' href='#IABAUTH'>[IABAUTH]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rescorla, E., &ldquo;A Survey of Authentication Mechanisms,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> seem potentially useful in
	this case.  Note that mechanisms in this space tend to have
	significant deployment problems because of intellectual
	property issues.  
</p>
<p>The second implication of this requirement is that if an
	authentication token is presented to a website,  the website
	MUST NOT be able to modify the token to authenticate as the
	user to  a third party.  The
	party generating the token must bind it to
	either the website that will receive the token or to a key
	known only to the user.    Binding could include cryptographic binding or mechanisms such as issuing a one-time password for use with a specific website.  If tokens are bound to keys, the
	user MUST prove knowledge of this key as part of the
	authentication process.  The key MUST NOT be disclosed to the
	server unless the token  is bound to the server and the key is
	only used with that token.

Mutual Authentication</h3>

<p><a class='info' href='#ANTIPHISHING'>[ANTIPHISHING]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nelson, J. and D. Jeske, &ldquo;Limits to Anti Phishing,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> describes a
	requirement for mutual authentication.  A common phishing
	practice is to accept a user name and password as part of an
	attempt to make the phishing site authentic.  The real target
	is some other confidential information.  The user name and
	password are captured, but are not verified.  After the
	user name and password are entered, the phishing site collects
	other confidential information.   
</p>
<p>Authentication of the server and client at the TLS level is sufficient to meet the requirement of mutual authentication.  
If authentication is based on a shared secret such as a
	password, then the authentication protocol MUST prove that
	the secret or a suitable verifier is known by both parties.
	Interestingly the existence of a shared secret will provide
	better protection that the right server is being contacted
	than if public key credentials are used.  By their nature,
	public key credentials allow parties to be contacted without a
	prior security association.  In protecting  against phishing
	targeted at obtaining other confidential information,
	this may prove a liability.    However public key credentials
	provide strong protection against phishing targeted at
	obtaining authentication credentials because they  are not
	vulnerable to dictionary attacks.  Such dictionary attacks are
	a significant weakness of shared secrets such as passwords
	intended to be remembered by humans.  
For public key protocols, this requirement would mean that the
	server  typically needs  to sign an assertion of what identity
	it  authenticated.

Authentication Tied to
	Resulting Page</h3>

<p>Users expect that whatever party they authenticate to will
	be the party  that generates the content they see.  One
	possible phishing attack is to insert the phisher between the
	user and the real site as a man-in-the-middle.  On
	today's websites, the phisher typically gains the user's
	user name and password.   Even if the other requirements of
	this specification are met,  the phisher could gain access to
	the user's session on the target site.     This attack is of
	particular concern to the banking industry.  A
	man-in-the-middle may  gain access to the session which may
	give the phisher confidential information or  the
	ability to execute transactions on the user's behalf.  
</p>
<p>The authentication system MUST guarantee to the user and
	the target server that the response  is generated by the
	target server and the contents of the response will only be seen by parties authorized by
	either the target server or the user.  This can be done in
	several ways:
</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Assuming that only certificates from trusted CAs are
	    accepted and the user has not bypassed server certificate
	    validation, it is sufficient to confirm that the identity
	    of the server at the TLS level is the same at the HTTP
	    authentication level.  In the case of TLS client
	    authentication this is trivially true.
</li>
<li>Another alternative is to bind
	the authentication exchange to the channel created by the TLS
	session.   The general concept behind channel binding is
	discussed in section 2.2.2 of <a class='info' href='#BTNS'>[BTNS]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Touch, J., &ldquo;Problem and Applicability Statement for Better Than Nothing Security,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>.

</li>
<li>Redirect based schemes in which the identity provider

	    requirement provided again that certificate validation is
	    done at the TLS layer.

Restricted Identity Providers</h3>

<p>Some identity providers will allow anyone to accept
	their identity.  However particularly for financial
	institutions and large service providers it will be common
	that only authorized business partners will be able to accept
	the identity.  The confirmation that the the relying party is
	such a business partner  will often be a significant part of
	the value provided by the identity provider, so it is
	important that the protocol enable this.    For such
	identities, the user MUST be assured that  the target server
	is authorized by the identity provider to accept identities
	from that identity provider.  Several mechanisms could be used
	to accomplish this:
</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>The target server can provide a certificate issued by
	    the identity provider as part of the authentication.
</li>
<li>The identity provider can explicitly approve the
	    target server.  For example in a redirect-based scheme  the
	    identity provider knows the identity of the relying party
	    before providing claims of identity to that party.    A
	    similar situation happens with Kerberos.

Protecting Enrollment</h3>

<p>One area of particular vulnerability to phishing is
	enrollment of a new identity in an identity provider.  Protecting against phishing targeted at obtaining

	information such as credit card numbers are provided as part
	of account setup, then this may be a target for phishing.
</p>
<p>However there is one critical aspect in which enrollment
	impacts the security of authentication.  During enrollment, a
	password is typically established for an account at an
	identity provider.  The process of establishing a password
	MUST NOT  provide a strong password equivalent (a quantity  such as the password itself that could be used to log into another service where the same password is used as the user) to the identity
	provider.  That is, the identity provider MUST NOT gain enough
	information to impersonate the user to a third party while
	establishing a password.

Is it the right Server?</h3>

<p>In <a class='info' href='#REQUIREMENTS'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Requirements for Preventing       Phishing</span><span>)</span></a>, requirements were presented
      for web authentication solutions to minimize the risk of
      phishing targeted at web access information.  This section
      discusses in a non-normative manner  various mechanisms for
      determining that the right server has been contacted.
      Authenticating to the right party is an important part of
      reducing the risk of phishing targeted at other confidential
      information.
</p>
<p>Validation of the certificates used in TLS and verification
      that the name in the URI maps to these certificates can be
      useful.  As discussed in <a class='info' href='#THREAT'>Section&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Threat Model</span><span>)</span></a>, attackers can
      spoof the name in the URI.  However the TLS checks do defeat
      some attacks.  Also, as discussed in <a class='info' href='#BINDING'>Section&nbsp;4.5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Authentication Tied to 	Resulting Page</span><span>)</span></a>,
      TLS validation may be important to higher-level checks.
</p>
<p>A variety of initiatives propose to assign trust to servers.
      This includes proposals to allow users to indicate certain
      servers are trusted based on information they enter.  Also,
      proposals to allow third parties including parties established
      for this purpose and existing certificate authorities to
      indicate trust have been made.    These proposals will almost
      certainly make phishing more difficult.
</p>
<p>In the case where  there is an existing relationship, these
      requirements provide a way that information about the
      relationship can be used to provide  assurance that the right
      party has been contacted.  
</p>
<p>In <a class='info' href='#TRUSTEDUI'>Section&nbsp;4.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Trusted UI</span><span>)</span></a>, we discuss how a secret
      between the user and their local computer can be used to
       let the user know when a password will be handled securely.  A
      similar mechanism can be used to help the user once they are 
	authenticated to the website.  The website can present
      information based on a secret shared between the user and website to
	convince the user that they have authenticated to the correct
	site.  This  depends critically on the
	requirements of <a class='info' href='#BINDING'>Section&nbsp;4.5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Authentication Tied to 	Resulting Page</span><span>)</span></a> to guarantee that the
	phisher cannot obtain the secret.  It is tempting to use this form of trusted UI before
	authentication.  For example, a website could request a
	user name and then  display  information  based on a secret for
	that user before accepting a password.  The problem with this
	approach is that phishers can obtain this information, because
	it can be obtained without knowing the password.  However if
	the secret  is displayed after authentication then phishers
	could not obtain the secret.  This is one of the many
	reasons why it is important to prevent phishing targeted at
	authentication credentials.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>This memo discusses the security of  web authentication and
      how to minimize the risk of phishing  in web authentication
      systems.  This section discusses the security of the overall
      system  and discusses how components of the system that are not
      directly within the scope of this document affect the  security
      of web transactions.  This section also discusses residual risks
      that remain even when the requirements proposed here are
      implemented.  
</p>
<p>The approach taken here is to separate the problem of
      phishing into phishing targeted at web authentication
      credentials and phishing targeted at other information.  Users
      are given some trusted mechanism to determine whether they are
      typing their password into a secure browser component that will
      authenticate them to the web server or whether they are typing
      their password into a legacy mechanism that will send their
      password to the server.  If the user types a password into the
      trusted browser component, they have strong assurances that
      their password has not been disclosed and that the page returned
      from the web server was generated by a party that either knows
      their password or who is authenticated by an identity provider
      who knows their password.  The web server can then use
      confidential information known to the user and web server to
      enhance the user's trust in its identity beyond what is
      available given the social engineering attacks against TLS
      server authentication.  If a user enters their password into the
      wrong server  but discovers this before they give that server
      any other confidential information, then there exposure is very
      limited.
</p>
<p>This model assumes that the browser and operating system are
      a trusted component.  As discussed in <a class='info' href='#THREAT'>Section&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Threat Model</span><span>)</span></a>,
      there are numerous attacks against host security.  Appropriate
      steps should be taken to minimize these risks.  If the host
      security is compromised, the password can be captured as it is
      typed by the user.
</p>
<p>This model assumes that users will  only enter their
      passwords into trusted browser components.  There are  several
      potential problems with this assumption.  First, users need to
      understand the UI distinction and know what it looks like when
      they are typing into a trusted component and what a legacy HTML
      form looks like.  Users must care enough about the security of
      their passwords to only type them into trusted components.  The
      browser must be designed in such a way that the server cannot
      create a UI component that appears to be a trusted component but
      is actually a legacy HTML form; <a class='info' href='#TRUSTEDUI'>Section&nbsp;4.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Trusted UI</span><span>)</span></a>
      discusses this requirement.  

</p>
<p>In addition,  a significant risk that users will type their
      password into legacy HTML forms comes from the incremental
      deployment of any web authentication technology.  Websites will
      need a way to work with older web browsers that do not yet
      support mechanisms that meet these requirements.    Not all
      websites will immediately adopt these mechanisms.   Users will
      sometimes browse from computers that have mechanisms meeting
      these requirements and sometimes from older browsers.    They
      only gain protection from phishing  when they type passwords
      into trusted components.  If the same  password is sometimes used with
      websites  that meet these requirements and sometimes with legacy
      websites, and if the password is captured by a phisher targeting
      a legacy website, then that captured password can be used even
      on websites meeting these requirements.  Similarly, if a user is
      tricked into using HTML forms when they should not, passwords
      can be exposed.  Users can significantly reduce this risk by
      using different passwords for websites that use trusted browser
      authentication than for those that still use HTML forms.  
</p>
<p>The risk of dictionary attack is always a significant concern
      for password systems.  Users can (but typically do not) minimize
      this risk by choosing long, hard to guess phrases for
      passwords.  The risk of offline dictionary attack can be removed once a password is already
      established by using a zero-knowledge password protocol.
      The risk of online dictionary attack is always present.  The  risk of offline dictionary attack is always present when
      setting up a new password  or changing a password.  Minimizing
      the number of services that use the same password can minimize
      this risk.  When zero-knowledge password protocols are used,  being
      extra careful to make sure the right server is used when
      establishing a password can significantly reduce  this risk.

<a name="rfc.section.A"></a><h3>Appendix A.&nbsp;
Trusted UI Mechanisms</h3>

<p>There are three basic approaches to establishing a trusted
	UI.  The first is to use a dynamic UI based on a secret known
	by the user;  <a class='info' href='#ANTIPHISHING'>[ANTIPHISHING]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nelson, J. and D. Jeske, &ldquo;Limits to Anti Phishing,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>
	recommends this approach.   A second approach is to provide a
	UI action  that highlights  trusted or non-trusted components
	in some way.  This could work similarly to the Expose  feature
	in Apple's OS X where a keystroke visually distinguishes
	structural elements of the UI.  Of course such a mechanism
	would only be useful if users actually used it.  Finally, the
	multi-level security community has extensive research in
	designing UIs  to display classified, compartmentalized
	information.  It is critical that these UIs be able to label
	information and that these labels not be spoofable.  
</p>
<p>See <a class='info' href='#SERVER'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Is it the right Server?</span><span>)</span></a> for another case where
	confidential information in a UI can be used to build trust.

Changes since 05</h3>

<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Clarified introduction to distinguish what happens at the TLS layer and what at the HTTP layer.  Discuss motivation of phishing more.
</p>
<p>In the introduction, restate claims to be more accurate.  These requirements are useful if users actually use the authentication mechanisms; convincing them to do so and making it obvious whether they are is a significant risk.  Also, we may give them the theoretical information necessary to detect fraud, but whether they act on that is open.
</p>
<p>Add a purpose of this memo section.  Whatever text ends up there after community discussion needs to be called out in the last call.
</p>
<p>Add a section calling out the difference between plaintext password protocols and  password interface.  This needs to be worked into the rest of the document.
</p>
<p>Update the threat model.  Significant hopefully clarifying changes.

<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Updated threat model to give examples of attacks that are in scope and to more clearly discuss host security based on comments from Chris Drake.
</p>
<p>Clarify attacks of interest to be consistent with the introduction.  
</p>
<p>Fix ups regarding one-time passwords.  I'm not sure that OTPs can meet all the requirements but clean things up where they clearly can meet a requirement.
</p>
<p>Clarify that in the mutual authentication case I'm concerned about authentication of client to the server.
