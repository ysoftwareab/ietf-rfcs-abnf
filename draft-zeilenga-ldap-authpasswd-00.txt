2.   Abstract

  This document describes schema for storing authentication passwords in
  a LDAP [RFC2251] directory.  The document provides schema definitions
  for authPassword and related schema definitions.  The authPassword is
  meant to used instead of clear text password storage mechanisms such
  as userPassword [RFC2256].  The attribute may be used to store SASL
  [RFC2222] authentication passwords in entries of a directory.

  The key words ``MUST'', ``MUST NOT'', ``REQUIRED'', ``SHALL'', ``SHALL

  NOT'', ``SHOULD'', ``SHOULD NOT'', ``RECOMMENDED'',  and ``MAY'' in
  this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
  [RFC2119].


3.   Background and Intended Use

  userPassword attribute is intended for plain text storage of user
  passwords [RFC 2256].  It is inappropriate for userPassword to have
  values which are encrypted passwords.

  authPassword is intended to be used to store hashed password values
  for authentication purposes.  The attribute may be used by servers to
  implement LDAP simple bind and SASL [RFC 2222] user/password
  mechanisms such as DIGEST-MD5 [DIGEST-MD5].

  Though values of authPassword are secured by use of a
  cryptographically safe one-way hash, they SHOULD be protected as if
  the password was stored in plain text.  In particular, if the values
  used by some SASL mechanisms are compromised for a given user, then
  the attacker may falsely authenticate as this user and gain immediate
  access to all information to which that user is authorized.


4.   Schema Definitions

  The following schema definitions are written using the BNF form
  described in RFC 2252 [RFC2252].


4.1. authPasswordSyntax

    ( authPasswordSyntaxOID
      DESC 'authentication password syntax' )

  Values of this syntax are encoded according to the following BNF:

    authPasswordValue = scheme "$" [ info ] "$" hashedValue
    scheme = <an IA5 string of letters, numbers, and "-", "_", and "/">
    info = <a base64 encoded value>
    hashedValue = <a base64 encoded value>

  where scheme describes the hash mechanism, info is a scheme specific,
  and hashedValue is the hashed value.  The info field is often a salt.


4.2. authPasswordMatch

INTERNET-DRAFT              LDAP AuthPasswd             17 December 1999


    ( authPasswordSyntaxOID
      NAME 'authPasswordMatch'
      DESC 'authentication password matching rule'
      SYNTAX authPasswordSyntaxOID )

  This matching rule allows a client to assert that a password matches
  the password stored in the directory.  The server shall compare the
  stored hashedValue with a value derived from the asserted value and
  the stored info field according to the scheme of the attribute value.


4.3. supportedAuthSchemes

    ( supportedAuthPasswordSchemesOID
      NAME 'supportedAuthPasswordSchemes'
      DESC 'supported password hash schemes'
      SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.26
      USAGE dSAOperation )

  The values of this attribute are case insensitive names of supported
  cryptographic secure hash schemes which the server supports.  This
  attribute may only be present in the root DSE.  If the server does not
  support any mechanisms this attribute will not be present.


4.4. authPassword

    ( authPasswordOID NAME 'authPassword'
      EQUALITY authPasswordMatch
      SYNTAX authPasswordSyntaxOID )

  The values this attribute are encrypted user password(s).  The
  attribute may be used for authentication purposes.

  Transfer of authentication password values is strongly discouraged
  where the underlying transport service cannot guarantee
  confidentiality and may result in disclosure of the values to
  unauthorized parties.


4.5. authPasswordObject
    ( authPasswordObjectOID NAME 'authPasswordObject'
      DESC 'hashed password mixin class'
      MUST 'authPassword'      AUXILIARY )

  Entries of this object class contain authentication passwords.

5.   Schemes

  This section describes the "MD5", "SHA1", and "SASL/DIGEST-MD5".
  Other schemes may be defined by other documents.  Schemes starting
  with string "SASL/" indicate association with a SASL mechanism.
  Schemes which are not described by standard track documents SHOULD be
  named with a leading "X-" or, if associated with a SASL mechanism,
  "SASL/X-" to indicate they are a private or implementation specific
  extension.  Scheme names are case insensitive.

5.1. MD5 scheme

  The MD5 [RFC1321] scheme name is "MD5".

  The hashedValue is the base64 encoding of an MD5 Digest of the
  concatenation the user password and optional salt.  The salt is
  provided in the info field.  Implementations of this scheme must
  support salts up to 128-bit in length.  Use with a 64-bit or larger
  salt is RECOMMENDED.

  Example:
    Given a user "joe" who's password is "mary" and a salt of
    "salt", the info field would be the base64 encoding of "salt"
    and the hashValue field would be the base64 encoding of the
    MD5 digest of "marysalt".

  Values of this scheme SHOULD only be used to implement simple
  user/password authentication.

  It is RECOMMENDED that values of this scheme be protected as if they
  were plaintext passwords.


5.2. SHA1 scheme

  The SHA1 [SHA1] scheme name is "SHA1".

  The hashedValue is the base64 encoding of an SHA1 Digest of the
  concatenation the user password and the optional salt.  The salt is
  provided in the info field.  Implementations of this scheme must
  support salts up to 128-bit in length.  Use with a 64-bit or larger
  salt is RECOMMENDED.

  Example:
    Given a user "joe" who's password is "mary" and a salt of
    "salt", the info field would be the base64 encoding of "salt"
    and the hashValue field would be the base64 encoding of the
    SHA1 digest of "marysalt".

INTERNET-DRAFT              LDAP AuthPasswd             17 December 1999


  Values of this scheme SHOULD only be used to implement simple
  user/password authentication.

  It is RECOMMENDED that values of this scheme be protected as if they
  were plaintext passwords.


5.3. DIGEST-MD5 scheme

  The DIGEST-MD5 [DIGEST-MD5] scheme name is "SASL/DIGEST-MD5".

  The hashedValue is the base64 encoding of
    H( { username-value, ":", realm-value, ":", passwd } )

  and info is the base64 encoding of
    { username-value, ":", realm-value }

  as defined by the DIGEST-MD5 specfication.

  Example:
    Given a user "joe" within the realm "localhost" who's password
    is "mary", the info field would be the base64 encoding of
    "joe:localhost" and the hashValue field would be the base64
    encoding of the MD5 digest of "joe:localhost:mary".

  Values of this scheme SHOULD only be used to implement the
  SASL/DIGEST-MD5 as described by the AuthMeth [AuthMeth] specification.

  Values of this scheme MUST be protected as if it the values were
  plaintext passwords per reasons detailed in DIGEST-MD5, Section 3.9,
  "Storing Passwords."


6.   Recommended schemes

  For implementations of this specification:

    Servers that support the simple bind method MUST support the
    MD5 scheme and SHOULD support the SHA1 scheme.

    Clients SHOULD not initiate operations which provide or assert
    values of authPassword unless confidentiality protection is
    in place.

    Servers SHOULD not provide values of authPassword unless
    confidentiality protection is in place.

7.      Security Considerations

  This document describes how information which may be used for
  authentication purposes may be stored.  The values stored SHOULD be
  protected as if they were plaintext passwords.
