   Abstract 
       
      This document updates RFC 4355 by registering a new enumservice 
      subtype "smpp" under the existing type "sms" using the URI scheme 
      "smpp" as per the IANA registration process defined in RFC 3761 and 
      draft-ietf-enum-enumservices-guide-07 and registers a new URI scheme 
      "smpp" according to the URI registration procedure in RFC 4395. 
       
      This enumservice subtype indicates that the remote resource 
      identified by the URI can receive short messages using the Short 
      Message Peer-to-Peer Protocol (SMPP).

                       "sms:smpp" and URI Scheme "smpp"  
    
   3. Introduction 
       
      ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping) [2] is a system that transforms 
      E.164 [10] telephone numbers into domain names and then uses 
      the Domain Name System (DNS) [11] and Naming Authority Pointer 
      (NAPTR) [3] resource records (RRs) to query for the services 
      or resources that are available for a specific domain name.  
       
      This document updates RFC 4355 [4] by registering a new enumservice 
      subtype "smpp" under the existing type "sms" using the URI scheme 
      "smpp" as per the IANA registration process defined in RFC 3761 [2] 
      and draft-ietf-enum-enumservices-guide-07 [12] and registers a new 
      URI scheme "smpp" according to the URI registration procedure in RFC 
      4395 [5]. 
       
      This enumservice subtype indicates that the remote resource 
      identified by the URI can receive short messages using the Short 
      Message Peer-to-Peer Protocol (SMPP) [13]. 
          
      The purpose of the registered enumservice subtype and URI 
      scheme is to enable service providers to exchange the short 
      message traffic over IP using the widely supported SMPP.  
        
      SMPP sessions can be established over TCP/IP or X.25 [14] 
      connections.  This document discusses only the TCP/IP case.  
      Several radio access technologies are used by the mobile networks 
      worldwide, the way the Global system for Mobile Communications 
      (GSM) systems handle the short message delivery [15,16] is used in 
      this document to simplify the discussions.   
       
      For a mobile-originated short message, the Mobile-services 
      Switching Center (MSC) or Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) that 
      serves the sender submits the short message to the Service Center 
      (SC) in the sender's home network via the Interworking MSC for 
      Short Message Service (SMS-IWMSC).  A successful short message 
      delivery to a mobile user involves the SC and Gateway MSC for Short 
      Message Service (SMS-GMSC) in the sender's home network that 
      queries the Home Location Register (HLR) in the receiver's home 
      network via Signaling System Number 7 (SS7) to retrieve information 
      about the MSC and/or SGSN that currently serve(s) the receiver 
      followed by the short message delivery to the MSC or SGSN via SS7.  
      This document uses the Short Message Service Center (SMSC) to avoid 
      mentioning the SMS-GMSC, SMS-IWMSC and SC to simplify the 
      discussions.

                       "sms:smpp" and URI Scheme "smpp"  
    
   4. Formal Syntax 
       
      RFC 4355 [4] allows subtypes be defined under the type "sms".  This 
      document proposes a new subtype "smpp" so the enumservice is 
      "sms:smpp". 
       
      The syntax specification using the augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) 
      as described in RFC 5234 [6] for the "smpp" URI can be found in 
      Section 8.2. 
       
    
   5. Use Cases 
       
      There are at least five use cases where some network entities in 
      the mobile networks that deal with short message submission or 
      delivery may want to retrieve the "smpp" URI via ENUM queries so as 
      to deliver the short messages via SMPP/IP instead of SS7. 
         
      a. An SMS hub provider that receives a short message from the 
        originating network can send an ENUM query to retrieve the 
        "smpp" URI for the destination mobile telephone number.   If the 
        destination mobile telephone number is served by a mobile 
        operator (identified by the information in the host part of the 
        URI) that uses this SMS hub provider's service, the SMS hub 
        provider can use the information in the "smpp" URI to terminate 
        the short message via SMPP/IP.   If the destination mobile 
        telephone number is served by a mobile operator that does not 
        use this SMS hub provider's service, the SMS hub provider simply 
        forwards the short message to the SMS hub provider that can 
        reach the destination mobile operator. 
       
      b. The SMSC in the sender's home network that receives a short 
        message from the sender can send an ENUM query to see if the 
        home operator that serves the destination mobile telephone 
        number has an SMS Gateway (GW) (e.g., SMS Router [17] or IP-SM-
        GW in [18,19,20]) that can receive all the mobile-terminated 
        short messages via SMPP/IP.  If the "smpp" URI is found and SMPP 
        sessions with the remote resource are allowed, the short message 
        is delivered to the SMS Gateway via SMPP/IP.  Otherwise, the 
        SMSC handles the short message as is done today except that it 
        may send the ENUM query as is described in case #c after it 
        receives the positive response from the HLR. 
       
      c. The SMSC in the sender's home network that has queried the HLR 
        associated with the destination mobile telephone number and 
        received the E.164 number associated with the MSC and/or SGSN 
        that currently serve(s) the destination mobile telephone number 
        can send an ENUM query to see if the MSC or SGSN can receive the

                      IANA Registrations for Enumservice         May 2008   
                       "sms:smpp" and URI Scheme "smpp"  
    
        short messages via SMPP/IP.  If the "smpp" URI is found and SMPP 
        sessions with the remote resource are allowed, the short message 
        is delivered via SMPP/IP.  Otherwise, the short message is 
        delivered via SS7. 
       
      d. The SMS GW mentioned in case #b above that receives an incoming 
        short message via SS7 or IP and wants to send the short message 
        to the MSC or SGSN that currently serves the destination mobile 
        telephone number can send an ENUM query to see if that MSC or 
        SGSN can receive the short messages via SMPP/IP.  If the "smpp" 
        URI is found and SMPP sessions with the remote resource are 
        allowed, the short message is delivered via SMPP/IP.  Otherwise, 
        the short message is delivered via SS7.  Certainly, the SMS GW 
        can deliver the message via IP if the terminating device 
        supports the capabilities specified in [18,19,20].  
       
      e. The MSC or SGSN serving the sender can use the E.164 number 
        associated with the sender's home SMSC to send an ENUM query to 
        see if that SMSC can receive short messages via SMPP/IP.  If the 
        "smpp" URI is found and SMPP sessions with the remote resource 
        are allowed, the short message is delivered via SMPP/IP.  
        Otherwise, the short message is delivered via SS7. 
    
      ENUM queries may not be needed for countries that do not support 
      mobile number portability (MNP) because the prefix of the 
      destination mobile telephone number or the E.164 numbers associated 
      with the MSC, SGSN and SMSC and locally provisioned data together 
      may be sufficient to identify the remote entity/resource and 
      whether the remote entity/resource supports SMPP/IP.  When the 
      destination mobile telephone number is subject to MNP and ENUM 
      provides MNP-corrected responses, the querier can use an ENUM query 
      to see if the response contains the "smpp" URI. 
       
      For the five cases above, case #a is the most likely case to happen 
      because the SMS hub providers currently use SMPP to communicate 
      with the originating SMSC, with each other, and/or with the 
      destination SMS GW.  But they currently use local or remote 
      databases and/or other operator-specific information to identify 
      the destination operator and the destination SMS GW. 
       
      More and more operators may deploy SMS GWs to receive all incoming 
      mobile-terminated short messages for reasons stated in [17] or for 
      delivering the messages over IP [18,19,20].  When that happens, 
      more SMSCs may send ENUM queries to see if they can retrieve the 
      "smpp" URI in the ENUM responses so as to deliver the short 
      messages via SMPP/IP without querying the HLR and delivering the

                       "sms:smpp" and URI Scheme "smpp"  
    
      short messages via SS7.  [18,19,20] discuss and specify how short 
      messages can be delivered to the terminating devices over IP when 
      the terminating devices support SMS over IP or Immediate Messaging 
      (IM) after the SMS GW (e.g., IP-SM-GW) receives the short messages 
      from the SMSCs over SS7.  Since the SMSCs are more likely to 
      support SMPP rather than Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [7], the 
      SMS GW can advertise its ability to receive short messages over 
      SMPP/IP via ENUM.  Using SIP to receive the short messages from the 
      SMSCs at the SMS GW that can deliver the messages to the 
      terminating devices via SIP is outside the scope of this document. 
       
      Cases #c, #d and #e may happen when many MSCs and SGSNs support 
      SMPP/IP. 
       
      An SMPP message is acknowledged immediately when received; 
      therefore, the SMPP mechanism that requests for notification on 
      actual message delivery should be used so as not to impact the 
      message delivery status reporting mechanism that is available when 
      the short message is delivered via SS7. 
         
    
   6. Example 
       
      $ORIGIN 4.3.2.1.4.3.4.1.7.5.1.example.net. 
          NAPTR 10 100 "u" "E2U+sms:smpp" 
               "!^.*!smpp:smsgw.mnoX.example.com!" . 
       
      In this example, an "smpp" URI is returned in the ENUM response.  
      The querying node, if supporting SMPP and having established 
      business relationship and prior exchange of security information 
      (e.g., system ID and password for SMPP session setup) with the 
      remote domain for sending the short messages via SMPP, can first 
      query to see if any Service (SRV) RR [21] can be retrieved via DNS 
      for  
       
          _smpp._tcp.smsgw.mnoX.example.com.  
       
      The querying node selects an SRV RR based on [21] if more than one 
      SRV RRs are retrieved and uses the host name in the "Target" field 
      of the SRV RR to retrieve the IP address via DNS.  If no SRV RR can 
      be found, it retrieves the IP address of "smsgw.mnoX.example.com" 
      via DNS.  It then establishes the SMPP session over TCP/IP, if not 
      yet established, and sends the short message via SMPP to that IP 
      address.  If an SRV RR is retrieved and selected, the port number in 
      the SRV RR is used for the TCP connection.  Otherwise, the default 
      port number of 2775 is used.

   7. Security Considerations 
    
      Please see the discussions on security considerations for the 
      registrations of Enumservice "sms:smpp" and URI scheme "smpp" in 
      Sections 8.1 and 8.2 respectively.   
       
       
   8. IANA Considerations 
       
      This document registers the "smpp" Enumservice using the subtype  
      "smpp" under the existing type "sms" in the Enumservice registry 
      described in the IANA considerations in RFC 3761 [2] and draft-ietf-
      enum-enumservices-guide-07 [12].   This document also registers with 
      the IANA the "smpp" URI scheme per RFC 4395 [5].  Details of the two 
      registrations can be found in Sections 8.1 and 8.2 below. 
          
       
   8.1. IANA Registration for Enumservice "sms:smpp" 
       
      Enumservice Name: smpp 
       
      Enumservice Class: Common Application 
       
      Enumservice Type: sms 
       
      Enumservice subtype: smpp 
       
      URI scheme: smpp 
       
      Functional Specification: This Enumservice indicates that the 
        resource identified by the associated URI is capable of receiving 
        short messages using the SMPP protocol [13].   
         
      Security Considerations: Use of the "sms:smpp" Enumservice shall 
        either be within a service provider's internal network, or on a 
        private basis between one or more parties.  It is assumed that 
        this Enumservice is used in an environment where entities are 
        trusted and general public or attackers are not supposed to have 
        access to the DNS RRs containing the "smpp" URI. 
       
        The initial purpose of this Enumservice and the "smpp" URI is to 
        indicate that the remote resource can receive short messages using 
        SMPP.  It is recommended that only the <hostport> appears in the 
        URI.  If the <userinfo> is present, it is recommended that it 
        contains the international telephone number with the leading "+" 
        so as not to convey user-specific information in the "smpp" URI. 
       
      Intended Usage: COMMON 
       
      Registration Document: This document contains all the information 
        needed for the registration of this enumservice subtype.

   8.2. IANA Registration for URI Scheme "smpp" 
       
      URI scheme name: smpp 
       
      Status: Permanent   
       
        SMPP is used by network entities operated by the 
        carriers/operators, inter-carrier vendors and service providers.  
        Use of this URI should be either be within a service provider's or 
        carrier's/operator's internal network, or on a private basis 
        between one or more parties using a variety of security mechanisms 
        to prevent general public access.   The DNS RRs that contain this 
        URI and are to be returned in ENUM responses should not be part of 
        the e164.arpa zone or any other portion of the Internet DNS tree.  
         
      URI scheme syntax: 
         
        smpp-uri       = "smpp:" [userinfo "@"] hostport  
                           *(";" uri-param) [headers] 
        userinfo       = user / telephone-subscriber 
        uri-param      = user-param / other-param 
        user-param     = "user=" ( "phone" / other-user ) 
         
        <hostport>, <headers>, <user>, <other-param> and <other-user> are 
        imported from RFC 3261 [7].  <telephone-subscriber> is imported 
        from RFC 3966 [8]. 
         
      URI scheme semantics: "user=phone" must be present when <telephone-
        subscriber> appears in the <userinfo> of the URI.  The default TCP 
        port number for SMPP is 2775.  If a port number appears in the 
        <hostport>, that port number should be used. 
       
        The initial purpose of an "smpp" URI is to return the host 
        information in the "smpp" URI in an ENUM response to identify the 
        remote resource that can receive short messages via SMPP/IP.   
        This URI is not intended to be used in other protocols (e.g., SIP 
        Request-URI) for addressing and routing purposes, at least for the 
        purpose of this document.  The URI scheme syntax provides an 
        extension mechanism to add parameters and header fields in the 
        future for other uses of this URI. 
       
      Encoding considerations: US-ASCII characters are included in the URI 
        without any conversion.   Non-US-ASCII characters MUST be percent-
        encoded as described in Section 2.1 of RFC 3986 [9].

                       "sms:smpp" and URI Scheme "smpp"  
    
      Intended usage: An "smpp" URI identifies a remote resource that can 
        receive short messages using the SMPP protocol.  The <hostport> of 
        the URI can be used to locate the IP address of that remote 
        resource.  Please see Section 6 of this document for an example on 
        how the host name in the <hostport> of the URI is used to locate 
        the IP address. 
       
      Applications/protocols that use this URL scheme name: The "smpp" URI 
        is intended to be used by entities that communicate with each 
        other using the SMPP protocol.  An entity that has a short message 
        to deliver and wants to find out if the remote entity that deals 
        with the destination telephone number or associated with a 
        telephone number can be reached via SMPP/IP, can make an ENUM 
        query to see if such a URI is returned in the ENUM response. 
       
      Interoperability considerations:  The URI is designed to be used 
        specifically for nodes in trusted systems that query private ENUM 
        implementations (e.g., Carrier ENUM). 
         
      Security considerations: The initial use of the "smpp" URI is for 
        Enumservice "sms:smpp" where the <"hostport> in the "smpp" URI 
        identifies the remote resource that can receive short messages 
        over SMPP/IP.  It is recommended that only the <hostport> appears 
        in the URI.  If the <userinfo> is present, it is recommended that 
        it contains the international telephone number with the leading 
        "+" so as not to convey user-specific information in the "smpp" 
        URI. 
       
        Frame Relay and Virtual Private Network (VPN) connections are 
        usually used to establish the SMPP sessions and each SMPP session 
        is authorized by verifying the System ID and password at session 
        setup time.   Those security related measures should be used.

      Author/change controller: This URI scheme is registered under the 
        IETF tree.  As such, the IETF maintains change control.
