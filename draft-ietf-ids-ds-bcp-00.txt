    1.  Summary and recommendations


    This document makes the following recommendations for
    organizations on the Internet:

     (1)   An organization SHOULD publish the E-mail addresses and
           some other info about Internet users within their site.

     (2)   It MUST do this in accordance with the laws of the land,
           and SHOULD also follow the recommendations of [PRIVACY]

     (3)   It SHOULD publish the information using X.500 as its data
           structure and naming scheme. It MAY additionally publish it
           using additional data structures such as whois++.

     (4)   It SHOULD make the published information available to LDAP
           clients, by supporting an LDAP server for those data.

     (5)   It SHOULD NOT attempt to charge for simple access to the
           data.

    In addition, it makes the following recommendations for various
    and sundry other parties:


     (1)   E-mail vendors SHOULD include LDAP lookup functionality
           into their products, either as built-in functionality or by
           providing translation facilities.

     (2)   Internet Service providers SHOULD help smaller
           organizations follow this recommendation, either by
           providing services for hosting their data, by helping them
           find other parties to do so, or by helping them bring their
           own service on-line.

     (3)   All interested parties SHOULD make sure there only exists
           one X.500 namespace in the world, and that all names in

draft          BCP for the Internet White Pages Service       April 96


           this namespace are resolvable.


    The rest of this document is justification and details for this
    recommendation.


    2.  Introduction

    The Internet is used for information exchange and communication
    between its users. It can only be effective as such if users are
    able to find each other's addresses. Therefore the Internet
    benefits from an adequate White Pages Service, i.e. a directory
    service offering (Internet) address information related to people
    and organizations.

    This document describes the way in which the Internet White Pages
    Service (from now on abbreviated as IWPS) is best exploited using
    today's experience, today's protocols, today's products and
    today's procedures.

    Experience ([SURFNET], [ESNET]....) has shown that a White Pages
    Service based on self-registration of users or on centralized
    servers tends to gather data in a haphazard fashion, and,
    moreover, collects data that ages rapidly and is not kept up to
    date.

    The most vital attempts to establish the IWPS are based on models
    with distributed (local) databases each holding a manageable part
    of the IWPS- information. Such a part mostly exists of all
    relevant IWPS- information from within a particular organisation
    or from within an Internet service provider and its users. On top
    of the databases there is a directory services protocol that
    connects them and provides user access. Today X.500 is the most
    popular directory services protocol on the Internet, connecting
    the address information of about 1.5 million individuals and 3,000
    organisations. Whois++ is the second popular protocol. X.500 and
    Whois++ may also be used to interconnect other information than
    only IWPS- information, but here we only discuss the IWPS
    features.

    Currently X.500 must be recommended as the directory services
    protocol to be used for the IWPS. However, future technology may
    make it possible to use other protocols as well or instead. When





Alvestrand, Jurg         Expires September 96                 [Page 3]

draft          BCP for the Internet White Pages Service       April 96


    such technology becomes available and experiments show that they
    work, this document will be updated.

    The sections 3-7 below contain recommendations related to the
    publication of information in the IWPS that are independent of a
    directory services protocol. The remainig sections discuss X.500
    specific issues.



    3.  Who should publish IWPS- information and how?

    IWPS- information is public address information regarding
    individuals and organizations. IWPS- information of an individual
    should be published and maintained by an organization that has a
    direct, durable link with this individual, like in the following
    cases:


    -    The individual is employed by the maintainer's organization

    -    The individual is enrolled in the university/school that
         maintains the data

    -    The individual is a (personal) subscriber of the maintainer's
         Internet service

    The organization that maintains the data doesn't have to store the
    data in a local database of its own. Though running a local
    database in the X.500 or Whois++ service is not a too difficult
    job, it is recommended that Internet service providers provide
    database facilities for those organizations among its customers
    that only maintain a small part of the IWPS- information or don't
    have enough system management resources. This will encourage such
    organizations to join the IWPS. Collection of IWPS- information
    and keeping it up-to-date should always be in the hands of the
    organization the information relates to.



    4.  What kind of information should be published?

    The information to be published about an individual should at
    least include:





Alvestrand, Jurg         Expires September 96                 [Page 4]

draft          BCP for the Internet White Pages Service       April 96


    -    The individual's name

    -    The individual's e-mail address, in RFC-822 format

    -    Some indication of the individual's relationship with the
         maintainer

    When X.500 is used as directory services protocol the last
    requirement may be fulfilled by using the "organizationalStatus"
    attribute (see [RFC1617]) or by adding a special organizational
    unit to the local X.500 namespace that reflects the the relation
    (like ou=students or ou=employees).

    Additionally some other public address information about
    individuals may be included in the IWPS:

    -    The individual's phone number

    -    The individual's fax number

    -    The individual's postal address

    -    The URL of the individual's home page on the Web

    Organizations should publish the following information about
    themselves in the IWPS:

    -    The URL of the organization's home page on the Web

    -    Postal address

    Organizations may also publish phone numbers.


    5.  Data management

    Data management, i.e. collecting the IWPS- information and keeping
    it up-to-date is a task that must not be underestimated for larger
    organizations. The following recommendations can be made with
    respect to these issues:


    -    An organization should achieve an executive level commitment
         to start a local database with IWPS- information. This will





Alvestrand, Jurg         Expires September 96                 [Page 5]

draft          BCP for the Internet White Pages Service       April 96


         make it much easier to get cooperation from people within the
         organisation that are to be involved in setting up a
         Directory Service.

    -    An organization should decide on the kind of information the
         database should contain and how it should be structured. It
         should follow the Internet recommendations for structuring
         the information. Besides the criteria in the previous
         section, [RFC-1274] and [RFC-1617]] should be followed if
         X.500 is used as directory services protocol.

    -    An organization should define criteria for the quality of the
         data in the Directory, like timeliness, update frequency,
         correctness, etc. These criteria should be communicated
         throughout the organization and contributing entities should
         commit to the defined quality levels.

    -    Existing databases within an organisation should be used to
         retrieve IWPS- and local information, to the greatest extent
         possible. An organization should involve the people who
         maintain those databases and make sure to get a formal
         written commitment from them to use their data source. The
         organization should rely on these people, since they have the
         experience in management and control of local, available
         data.

    -    The best motivation for an organization to join the IWPS is
         that they will have a local database for local purposes at
         the same time. A local database may contain more, not
         necessarily public, information and serve more purposes than
         is requested for in the IWPS. In connecting to the IWPS an
         organization must "filter out" the extra local information
         and services that is not meant for the public IWPS using the
         directory services protocol.

    6.  Legal issues

    Most countries have privacy laws regarding the publication of
    information about people. They range from the relaxed US laws to
    the UK requirement that information should be accurate to the
    Norwegian law that says that you can't publish unless you get
    specific permission from the individual. Every maintainer of IWPS-
    information should publish data according to the national law of
    the country in which the local database which holds the





Alvestrand, Jurg         Expires September 96                 [Page 6]

draft          BCP for the Internet White Pages Service       April 96


    information resides.

    Some of these are documented in [SURFNET] and [PRIVACY].

    A maintainer of IWPS- information should also follow some common
    rules, even when they are not legally imposed:

    -    Publish only correct information.

    -    Give people the possibility to view the information stored
         about themselves and the right to withold information or have
         information altered.

    -    Don't publish information "just because it's there". Publish
         what's needed and what's thought useful, and no more.

    Given the number of data management and legal issues that are
    involved in publishing IWPS- information, good consulting services
    are vital to have smaller companies quickly and efficiently join
    the IWPS. Internet service providers are encouraged to provide
    such services.


    7.  Do not charge for lookups

    A very common question with respect to the IWPS is how it has to
    be financed. In the current IWPS it believed that due to todays
    technological constraints, charging users is harmful to the
    viability of the service.  There are several arguments for this
    belief:

    -    Micropayment technology is not available at the moment.

    -    Subscription services require either that the customer sign
         up to multiple search services or that the services are
         linked "behind the scene" with all kinds of bilateral
         agreements; both structures have unacceptably high overhead
         costs and increase the entry cost to the service.

    -    The current directory services protocols do not support
         authentication to a level that would seem appropriate for a
         service that charges.







Alvestrand, Jurg         Expires September 96                 [Page 7]

draft          BCP for the Internet White Pages Service       April 96


    Therefore it is strongly recommended that all lookups by users in
    the IWPS are for free.  This, of course, does not limit in any way
    the ability to use the same IWPS dataset to support other services
    where charging may be appropriate.



    8.  Use X.500

    The IWPS based on the X.500 protocol has a relatively wide
    deployment. The current service contains about 3,5 million entries
    of individuals and 3,000 of organizations. It is coordinated by
    Dante, an Internet service provider in the UK, and known as
    "Nameflow/Paradise".

    Though X.500 is sometimes criticized by the fact that its
    functionality is restricted by the hierarchical naming structure
    it imposes, it provides a reasonably good functionality as has
    been shown in several pilots by organizations [SURFNET], [ESNET],
    [PARADISE], [AARNET] that are now running a production X.500 IWPS.
    User interfaces also determine the functionality the X.500 IWPS
    offers. Usually they offer lookups in the IWPS based on the
    following user input:

    -    The name of a person

    -    The name of an organization this person can be related to

    -    The name of a country

    As a result they will provide the publicly available information
    about the person in question. Most user interfaces offer the
    possibility to list organizations in a country and users in an
    organization to help users to make their choice for the input. It
    may also be possible to use part of the names as input or
    approximate names.

    Specific user interfaces can provide lookups based on other input,
    like e-mail addresses of people or postal addresses of
    organizations. Such possibilities may however violate privacy
    laws.

    See Appendix A for the algorithms used to achieve the
    functionality that is mentioned.





Alvestrand, Jurg         Expires September 96                 [Page 8]

draft          BCP for the Internet White Pages Service       April 96


    Organizations are strongly encouraged to use the X.500 protocol
    for joining the IWPS. The current service is based on the X.500
    1988 standard [xxx] and some Internet-specific additions to the
    protocol that connects the local databases [Kille] and to the
    access protocol [LDAP]. Organizations should use X.500 software
    based on these specifications and additionally supports [RFC1006]
    for the transportation of OSI protocols over the Internet.

    For recommendations on which attributes to use in X.500 and how to
    use them (either for public IWPS- information or additional local
    information the reader is referred to [RFC1274] and [RFC1617]. For
    specific non-public local purposes also new attributes (and object
    classes) may be defined.  Generally it should be recommended to
    use as much as possible the multi-valuedness of attributes in
    X.500 as this will improve the searching functionality of the
    service considerably. For example, the commonName attribute which
    can hold the common name of an organisation or person should
    contain all known aliases for the organization or person.

    Another recommendation that can be made is that replication of
    data [Kille] between local databases is used in order to improve
    the performance of the service. Since replicating all entries of a
    part of the IWPS from one local database in another may violate
    local privacy laws, it is recommended to restrict replication to
    country and organizational entries and knowledge references (which
    tell where to go for which part of the IWPS). Of course privacy
    laws are not violated when the replicating database is managed by
    the same organization as the one that masters the information. So
    local replication between two databases within the same
    organization is highly recommended.

    X.500 is not recommended to be used for:


    -    A Yellow Pages service with a large scope. See [SURFnet].

    -    Searching outside the limited patterns listed here, in
         particular searching for a person without knowing which
         organization he might be affiliated to.

    -    Publishing information in other character sets than ASCII,
         some of the Latin-based European scripts and Japanese (the
         T.61 character sets). ISO is revising X.500, but products
         that support the revision aren't available yet.

draft          BCP for the Internet White Pages Service       April 96


    9.  Use the global namespace

    Some people, for instance when using Novell 4 servers, have
    decided that they will use X.500 or X.500-like services as an
    internal naming mechanism, without coordinating with an outside
    source.

    This suffers from many of the same problems as private IP
    addresses, only more so: your data may need significant
    restructuring once you decide to expose them to the outer world.

    A globally accessible X.500 service requires a globally connected
    X.500 namespace.


    10.  Use LDAP

    At the moment, LDAP as documented in [LDAP] is the protocol that
    offers the most X.500 functionality in places where it is not
    feasible to implement the full OSI stack.

    It is implemented on a lot of platforms, including several PC-type
    platforms, and is popular in a multitude of commercial offerings.

    A concerted effort to make LDAP available is the publication
    method that gives the widest access to the data.

    In addition, DSAs must implement the necessary linkages to make
    sure they are properly integrated into the naming/referral tree;
    in most cases, this will mean that they should implement the X.500
    DSP protocol at least.

    (The question of whether one gateways LDAP to DAP or DAP to LDAP
    is irrelvant in this context)



    11.  Make services available

    The technical investment in running an X.500 service is not
    enormous.

draft          BCP for the Internet White Pages Service       April 96


    12.  Name globally

    Given that X.500 practically dictates that there should be a
    single root context operated under a cooperative agreement, one
    can be sure that there will be turf battles over its control.

    However, if those turf battles aren't decided outside the actual
    running service, the effect on the service quality will be
    ruinous.

    This document appeals to all players in the field to let existing
    practice alone until a better system is agreed and is ready to go
    into place; at the moment, the root context of the day is operated
    by the DANTE NameFlow project.

    APPENDIX A - Algorithms

    In pseudocode, the algorithms for X.500 searches used go like
    this:


    To get from (country, company, name) to entry:

    1) Search, single-level, the Root context for the country.
       Set the current location to this country.
    2) Search, single-level, the current context for the Organization and
       any Locality entries.
       Add the Locality entries to the list of possible search contexts.
    3) If the organization is not found, take the first context in the
       list of possible search contexts and go to 2).
    4) When the organization is found, search, whole subtree, for the
       person name.

    This algorithm requires:

    -    That the company name be unique within the country.
         Otherwise, first match may be returned.

    -    That the person name be unique within the company. Otherwise,
         multiple matches will be returned.

    -    That the whole subtree search is allowed across the whole
         company.

    This process can be considerably speeded up by a periodic
    searching of the country for all Organizations and storing these
    in a cache or private alias tree; however, this requires special
    code in the client.


    To get from E-mail address to entry:

    1) Take the last component of the domainname as the search object,
       and the root context as the only possible search context.





Alvestrand, Jurg         Expires September 96                [Page 12]

draft          BCP for the Internet White Pages Service       April 96


    2) Search, single-level, all the currently possible search contexts
       for the attribute "AssociatedDomain" with the value of the search object.
    3) If at least one  search was successful, take the list of found objects as
       the list of possible search contexts.
       Otherwise, keep the old set.
    4) If there are more components of the domainname, add one more
       component of the domainname to the search object, and go to 2)
    5) If the search failed, or there are no more domain components,
       search, whole-subtree, for the attribute "RFC822Address" with the
       whole E-mail address as its value.

    This algorithm requires:

    -    That AssociatedDomain be populated throughout the tree. Note
         that jumps are allowed; having "nexor.co.uk" directly under
         "C=gb/assocDomain=uk" is not a problem.

    -    That *all* entries having some entry under them in a given
         domain have the corresponding shortened AssociatedDomain; for
         instance, many countries would need to show the "com"
         AssociatedDomain.
