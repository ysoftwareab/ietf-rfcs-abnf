Abstract

   The General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST) protocol currently
   uses TCP or TLS over TCP for connection mode operation.  This
   document describes the usage of GIST over the Stream Control
   Transmission Protocol (SCTP).  The use of SCTP can take the advantage
   of features provided by SCTP, namely streaming-based transport,
   support of multiple streams to avoid head of line blocking, and the

   support of multi-homing to provide network level fault tolerance.
   Additionally, the support for some extensions of SCTP is also
   discussed, namely its Partial Reliability Extension and the usage of
   TLS over SCTP.

Internet-Draft               GIST over SCTP                February 2006


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the usage of the General Internet Signaling
   Transport (GIST) protocol [1] over the Stream Control Transmission
   Protocol (SCTP) [2].

   GIST, in its initial specification for connection mode operation,
   runs on top of a byte-stream oriented transport protocol providing a
   reliable, in-sequence delivery, i.e., using the Transmission Control
   Protocol (TCP) [4] for signaling message transport.  However, some
   NSLP context information has a definite lifetime, therefore, the GIST
   transport protocol must accommodate flexible retransmission, so stale
   NSLP messages that are held up by congestion can be dropped.
   Together with the head-of-line blocking issue and other issues with
   TCP, these considerations argue that implementations of GIST should
   support the Stream Control Transport Protocol (SCTP)[2] as an
   optional transport protocol for GIST, especially if deployment over
   the public Internet is contemplated.  Like TCP, SCTP supports
   reliability, congestion control, fragmentation.  Unlike TCP, SCTP
   provides a number of functions that are desirable for signaling
   transport, such as multiple streams and multiple IP addresses for
   path failure recovery.  In addition, its Partial Reliability
   extension (PR-SCTP) [5] supports partial retransmission based on a
   programmable retransmission timer.

   This document shows how GIST should be used with SCTP to provide
   these additional features to deliver the GIST C-mode messages (which
   can in turn carry NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP) [6] messages
   as payload).  More specifically:
      how to use the multiple streams feature of SCTP.
      how to handle the message oriented nature of SCTP.
      how to take the advantage of multi-homing support of SCTP.

   Additionally, this document also discusses how to support two
   extensions of SCTP, namely PR-SCTP [5] and TLS over SCTP [7].

   The method described in this document does not require any changes of
   GIST or SCTP.  It is only required that SCTP implementations support
   the optional feature of fragmentation of SCTP user messages.

   [2]) as follows:
   o  TLS - Transport Layer Security
   o  SCTP - Stream Control Transmission Protocol
   o  PR-SCTP - SCTP Partial Reliability Extension
   o  MRM - Message Routing Method
   o  MRI - Message Routing Information
   o  MRS - Message Routing State
   o  MA - A GIST Messaging Association is a single connection between
      two explicitly identified GIST adjacent peers on the data path.  A
      messaging association may use a specific transport protocol and
      known ports.  If security protection is required, it may use a
      specific network layer security association, or use a transport
      layer security association internally.  A messaging association is
      bidirectional; signaling messages can be sent over it in either
      direction, and can refer to flows of either direction.
   o  SCTP Association - A protocol relationship between SCTP endpoints,
      composed of the two SCTP endpoints and protocol state information.
      An association can be uniquely identified by the transport
      addresses used by the endpoints in the association.  Two SCTP
      endpoints MUST NOT have more than one SCTP association between
      them at any given time.
   o  Stream - A sequence of user messages that are to be delivered to
      the upper-layer protocol in order with respect to other messages
      within the same stream.


3.  GIST Over SCTP

3.1.  Message Association Setup

   The basic GIST protocol specification defines two possible protocols
   to be used in message associations, namely Forwards-TCP and TLS.
   This document adds Forwards-SCTP as another possible protocol.  In
   Forwards-SCTP, analog to Forwards-TCP, connections between peers are
   opened in the forwards direction, from the querying node, towards the
   responder.  SCTP connections may carry NSLP messages with the
   transfer attribute 'reliable'.

   A new MA-Protocol-ID type, "Forwards-SCTP", is defined in this
   document for using SCTP as GIST transport protocol.

3.2.  Stack-Configuration-Data information for SCTP

   In order to run GIST over SCTP, the Stack-Proposal and Stack-
   Configuration-Data objects need to recognize the Forwards-SCTP MA-
   Protocol-ID type, and interpret it for the transport protocol
   negotiation during the GIST MA setup handshake (e.g., whether SCTP
   runs alone or together with TLS).

Internet-Draft               GIST over SCTP                February 2006


   In turn, the "MA-protocol-options" field for Forwards-SCTP needs to
   be defined for the Stack-Configuration-Data object defined of GIST.
   This "MA-protocol-options" contains proposed values for the initial
   and maximum retransmission timeout (RTO) as well as a port number in
   the case of Response messages.  The proposed values for RTO are only
   suggestions to the peer and may be overridden by local policy.  In
   fact, in order to avoid denial of service attacks, the minimum RTO
   value is not included in the proposal and in addition implementations
   should only accept reasonable RTO proposals.

   The MA-protocol-options formats are:
   o  in a Query: 4 byte RTO initial value and 4 byte RTO maximum value
   o  in a Response: 4 byte RTO initial value, 4 byte RTO maximum value
      and 2 byte port number at which the connection will be accepted.

3.3.  Effect on GIST State Maintenance

   A GIST MA is established over an SCTP association, which comprises
   one or more SCTP streams.  Each of such streams can be used for one
   or multiple NSLP sessions (i.e., one or more MRSs).  After completing
   a GIST MA setup, which implicitly establishes a bi-directional SCTP
   stream, C-mode messages can be sent over the SCTP association in
   either direction.  Due to multi-streaming support of SCTP, it is easy
   to maintain sequencing of messages that affect the same resource
   (e.g., the same NSLP session), rather than maintaining all messages
   along the same transport connection/association in a correlated
   fashion as TCP (which imposes strict (re)ordering and reliability per
   transport level).

3.4.  PR-SCTP Support

   A variant of SCTP, PR-SCTP [5] provides a "timed reliability"
   service.  It allows the user to specify, on a per message basis, the
   rules governing how persistent the transport service should be in
   attempting to send the message to the receiver.  Because of the chunk
   bundling function of SCTP, reliable and partial reliable messages can
   be multiplexed over a single PR-SCTP association.  Therefore, a GIST
   over SCTP implementation SHOULD attempt to establish a PR-SCTP
   association instead of a standard SCTP association, if available, to
   support more flexible transport features for potential needs of
   different NSLPs.

3.5.  API between GIST and NSLP

   GIST specification defines an abstract API between GIST and NSLPs.
   While this document does not change the API itself, the semantics of
   some parameters have slightly different interpretation in the context
   of SCTP.  This section only lists those primitives and parameters,



Fu, et al.               Expires August 24, 2006                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft               GIST over SCTP                February 2006


   that need special consideration when used in the context of SCTP.
   The relevant primitives are repeatet from [1] to improve readability,
   but [1] remains authoritative.

3.5.1.  SendMessage

   The SendMessage primitive is used by the NSLP to initiate sending of
   messages.

   SendMessage ( NSLP-Data, NSLP-Data-Size, NSLP-Message-Handle,
                 NSLP-Id, Session-ID, MRI,
                 SSI-Handle, Transfer-Attributes, Timeout, IP-TTL, GHC )


   The following parameter has changed semantics:

   Timeout: According to [1] this parameter represents the "length of
   time GIST should attempt to send this message before indicating an
   error".  When used with SCTP, this parameter is also used as the
   timeout for the "timed reliability" service of PR-SCTP.

3.5.2.  NetworkNotification

   The NetworkNotification primitive is passed from GIST to an NSLP.  It
   indicates that a network event of possible interest to the NSLP
   occurred.

   NetworkNotification ( MRI, Network-Notification-Type )


   If SCTP detects a failure of the primary path, GIST should indicate
   this event to the NSLP by calling the NetworkNotification primitive
   with Network-Notification-Type "Routing Status Change".  This
   notification should be done even if SCTP was able to remain an open
   connection to the next peer due to its multi-homing capabilities.

3.6.  TLS over SCTP Support

   GIST using TLS over SCTP is similar to GIST using TLS over TCP ([1],
   Section 5.7.3).  One should note that an SCTP association with TLS
   support takes advantages of SCTP, such as multi-streaming and multi-
   homing.

   A future version of this document will add more text on this topic.

4.1.  MA-Protocol-Options

   This section provides the bit-level format for the MA-protocol-
   options field that is used for SCTP protocol in the Stack-
   Configuration-Data object of GIST (see Section 3.2).

   Initial RTO value = Initial RTO value (SCTP configuration) in msec
   Maximum RTO value = Maximum RTO value (SCTP configuration) in msec
   SCTP port number  = Port number at which the responder will accept
                       SCTP connections


   The SCTP port number is only supplied if sent by the responder.


5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of both [1] and [2] apply.  Further
   security analysis is needed to consider any additional security
   vulnerabilities, and will be included in an updated draft.


6.  IANA Considerations

   A new MA-Protocol-ID (Forwards-SCTP) needs to be assigned, with a
   recommended value of 3.
