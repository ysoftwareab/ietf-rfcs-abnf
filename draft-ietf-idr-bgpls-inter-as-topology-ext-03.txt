            BGP-LS Extension for Inter-AS Topology Retrieval
             draft-ietf-idr-bgpls-inter-as-topology-ext-03

Abstract

   This document describes the process to build BGP-LS key parameters in
   inter-domain scenario, defines one new BGP-LS NLRI type(Stub Link
   NLRI) and some new inter-AS TE related TLVs for BGP-LS to let SDN
   controller retrieve the network topology automatically under various
   inter-AS environments.

   Such extension and process can enable the network operator to collect
   the interconnect information between different domains and then
   calculate the overall network topology automatically based on the
   information provided by BGP-LS protocol.

1.  Introduction

   BGP-LS [RFC7752] describes the methodology that using BGP protocol to
   transfer the Link-State information.  Such method can enable SDN
   controller to collect the underlay network topology automatically,
   but normally it can only get the information within one IGP domain.
   If the operator has more than one IGP domain, and these domains
   interconnect with each other, there is no mechanic within current
   BGP- LS to transfer the interconnect topology information.

Internet-Draft             BGP-LS-Inter-AS-Ext                 July 2019


   Draft [I-D.ietf-idr-bgpls-segment-routing-epe] defines some
   extensions for exporting BGP peering node topology information
   (including its peers, interfaces and peering ASs) in a way that is
   exploitable in order to compute efficient BGP Peering Engineering
   policies and strategies.  Such information can also be used to
   calculate the interconnection topology among different IGP domains,
   but it requires the border routers to run BGP-LS protocol and report
   the information to the PCE/SDN controller, which restricts the
   solution deployment flexibility.

   This draft analysis the situations that the PCE/SDN controller needs
   to get the interconnected topology information between different AS
   domains, defines the new Stub Link NLRI and some new TLVs within the
   BGP-LS protocol to transfer the key information related to them.
   After that, the SDN controller can then deduce the multi-domain
   topology automatically based on the information from BGP-LS protocol.

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] .

3.  Inter-AS Domain Scenarios.

   Fig.1 illustrates the multi-domain scenarios that this draft
   discusses.  Normally, SDN Controller can get the topology of IGP A
   and IGP B individually via the BGP-LS protocol, but it can't get the
   topology connection information between these two IGP domains because
   there is generally no IGP protocol run on the connected links.

4.  Stub Link NLRI

   [RFC7752] defines four NLRI types(Node NLRI, Link NLRI, IPv4 Topology
   Prefix NLRI, IPv6 Topology Prefix NLRI) to transfer the topology and
   prefix information.  For inter-as link, the two ends of the link
   locates in different IGP domains, then it is not appropriate to
   transfer their information within the current defined NLRI types.

   This draft defines one new NLRI type, called Stub Link NLRI, which is
   coded as the following format:

        0                   1                   2                   3

   The "Protocol-ID" should be set to the value that indicates "Direct"
   protocol.

   The semantics of "Stub Link Descriptors" is same as that defined in
   [RFC7752] for "Link Descriptor".

   This newly defined NLRI can be used to describe the link that has
   only one end located within the IGP domain, as described in the
   following sections.

4.1.  Inter-AS Native IP Scenario

   Draft [I-D.ietf-teas-native-ip-scenarios] describes the situation
   that operator needs some traffic engineering solution for the inter-
   as native IP environment.  In such situation, different domain may
   run different IGP protocol.  The operator needs to know the inter-as
   topology first to calculate the end to end optimal centrally.

   When IGP A or IGP B in Figure 1 runs native IS-IS/OSPF protocol, the
   operator can use passive feature for the inter-domain links to let
   the routers within the IGP domain know these links.  Such stub links
   information can then be carried within the Stub Link NLRI reported
   via the BGP-LS protocol to the SDN controller.

   The "Local Node Descriptors" should describe the the characteristics
   of ASBRs that are connected these stub links.

   When such information is reported via the BGP-LS protocol, the PCE/
   SDN controller can construct the underlay inter-domain topology
   according to procedure described in section 6.

4.2.  Inter-AS TE Scenario

   When IGP A or IGP B in Figure 1 runs IS-IS TE/OSPF-TE
   protocol,[RFC5316] and [RFC5392] define IS-IS and OSPF extensions
   respectively to deal with the situation for inter-AS traffic
   engineering.  Three new sub-TLVs(Remote AS Number&#12289;IPv4 Remote
   ASBR ID&#12289;IPv6 Remote ASBR ID) which are associated with the
   inter-AS TE link are defined.

   These TLVs are flooded within the IGP domain automatically.  They can
   also be carried within the newly defined Stub Link NLRI within the
   BGP-LS protocol, as the descriptors for the inter-AS stub link.

   The "Local Node Descriptors" should describe the the characteristics
   of ASBRs that are connected these inter-AS TE links.

   If the PCE/SDN controller know these information via one of the
   interior router that runs BGP-LS protocol, the PCE/SDN controller can
   rebuild the inter-AS TE topology correctly according to the procedure
   described in section 6

5.  Inter-AS TE NLRI related TLVs

   This draft proposes to add three new TLVs that is included within the
   Stub Link NLRI to transfer the information via BGP-LS, which are
   required to build the inter-AS TE related topology by the PCE/SDN
   controller.

   The following Link Descriptor TLVs are added into the BGP-LS protocol
   :

   +-----------+---------------------+--------------+----------------+
   |  TLV Code | Description         |IS-IS/OSPF TLV| Reference      |
   |   Point   |                     |   /Sub-TLV   | (RFC/Section)  |

   |           |                     |              | [RFC5392]/3.3.1|
   |    TBD    |IPv4 Remote ASBR ID  |   25/22      | [RFC5316]/3.3.2|
   |           |                     |              | [RFC5392]/3.3.2|
   |    TBD    |IPv6 Remote ASBR ID  |   26/24      | [RFC5316]/3.3.3|
   |           |                     |              | [RFC5392]/3.3.3|
   +-----------+---------------------+--------------+----------------+
                Figure 3: Link Descriptor TLVs

   Detail encoding of these TLVs are synchronized with the corresponding
   parts in [RFC5316] and [RFC5392], which keeps the BGP-LS protocol is
   agnostic to the underly protocol.

5.1.  Remote AS Number TLV

   A new TLV, the remote AS number TLV, is defined for inclusion in the
   link descriptor when advertising inter-AS TE links.  The remote AS
   number TLV specifies the AS number of the neighboring AS to which the
   advertised link connects.

   The remote AS number TLV is TLV type TBD (see Section 8) and is 4
   octets in length.  The format is as follows:

   for the AS number, as in current deployments, the left (high-order) 2
   octets MUST be set to 0.  The remote AS number TLV MUST be included
   when a router advertises an inter-AS TE link.

5.2.  IPv4 Remote ASBR ID

   A new TLV, which is referred to as the IPv4 remote ASBR ID TLV, is
   defined for inclusion in the link descriptor when advertising inter-
   AS TE links.  The IPv4 remote ASBR ID TLV specifies the IPv4
   identifier of the remote ASBR to which the advertised inter-AS link
   connects.  This could be any stable and routable IPv4 address of the
   remote ASBR.  Use of the TE Router ID as specified in the Traffic
   Engineering router ID TLV [RFC5305] is RECOMMENDED.

   The IPv4 remote ASBR ID TLV is TLV type TBD (see Section 8) and is 4
   octets in length.  The format of the IPv4 remote ASBR ID sub-TLV is
   as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3

               Figure 5:  IPv4 Remote ASBR ID TLV Format

   The IPv4 remote ASBR ID TLV MUST be included if the neighboring ASBR
   has an IPv4 address.  If the neighboring ASBR does not have an IPv4
   address (not even an IPv4 TE Router ID), the IPv6 remote ASBR ID TLV
   MUST be included instead.  An IPv4 remote ASBR ID TLV and IPv6 remote
   ASBR ID TLV MAY both be present in an inter-AS TE link NLRI.

5.3.  IPv6 Remote ASBR ID

   A new TLV, which is referred to as the IPv6 remote ASBR ID TLV, is
   defined for inclusion in the link descriptor when advertising inter-
   AS links.  The IPv6 remote ASBR ID TLV specifies the IPv6 identifier

   This could be any stable and routable IPv6 address of the remote
   ASBR.  Use of the TE Router ID as specified in the IPv6 Traffic
   Engineering router ID TLV [RFC6119] is RECOMMENDED.

   octets in length.  The format of the IPv6 remote ASBR ID TLV is as
   follows:

   The IPv6 remote ASBR ID TLV MUST be included if the neighboring ASBR
   has an IPv6 address.  If the neighboring ASBR does not have an IPv6
   address, the IPv4 remote ASBR ID TLV MUST be included instead.  An
   IPv4 remote ASBR ID TLV and IPv6 remote ASBR ID TLV MAY both be
   present in an inter-AS TE link NLRI.

6.  Topology Reconstruction.

   When SDN Controller gets such information from BGP-LS protocol, it
   should compares the proximity of these stub links.  If they are under
   the same network scope, then it should find the corresponding
   associated router information, build the link between these two
   border routers.

   After iterating the above procedures for all of the stub links, the
   SDN controller can then retrieve the connection topology between
   different domains automatically.

7.  Security Considerations

   It is common for one operator to occupy several IGP domains that are
   composited by its backbone network and several MAN(Metrio-Area-
   Network)s/IDCs.  When they do traffic engineering which spans MAN,
   Backbone and IDC, they need to know the inter-as topology via the

   process described in this draft.  Using the passive interface
   features or configuring the TE parameters on the interconnect links
   will not spread the topology fluctuation across each other domain.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines:

   o  A new BGP NLRI Type: Stub Link NLRI.  The codepoint is from the
      "BGP-LS NLRI Types"

   o  Three new Link Descriptors TLV: Remote AS Number TLV, IPv4 Remote
      ASBR ID, IPv6 Remote ASBR ID.  The codepoint are from "BGP-LS Node
      Descriptor, Link Descriptor, Prefix Descriptor, and Attribute
      TLVs" registry.

8.1.  New BGP-LS NLRI type

   This document defines a new value in the registry "BGP-LS NLRI
   Types":

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |    Code Point  |   Description  |           Status            |

8.2.  New Link Descriptors

   This document defines three new values in the registry "BGP-LS Node
   Descriptor, Link Descriptor, Prefix Descriptor, and Attribute TLVs":

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
