Abstract

   The Internet Message Format originally formally specified in RFC 561
   has been extended in some ways and for some purposes which have posed
   difficulties for some desirable operations such as digitally signed
   messages, have led to clutter in message content which in turn has
   led user agent implementers to suppress display of some originator
   message content, leading in some cases to user confusion, surprise,
   and embarrassment.  This memo is part of a multi-document series that
   specifies an extensible message format which is intended to
   facilitate operations hampered by extensions to the current format
   and to reduce clutter in the user-to-user message content.  This memo
   defines supplementary guidelines for registration of media types
   relevant to the extensible message format.

Internet-Draft EMAIL Part 3: Media Registration Guidelines     July 2005

1. Introduction

   This memo will define guidelines for registration of media types
   suitable for use with the extensible message format defined in
   companion documents.  Media type registrations will of course also
   have to comply with the registration procedure(s) [N1.RFC2048],
   [N2.MediaReg].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHOULD",
   "RECOMMENDED" and "MAY" in this document are to be interpreted as
   described in [N3.BCP14].

2. Tree

   Media types suitable for use in the extensible message format are
   registered under the IETF standards tree "message" top-level type.

3. Syntax

   The syntax of the media type should be specified clearly to
   facilitate interoperable implementations.  A message subtype has
   characteristics defined in [N4.RFC2046].  If the subtype consists
   solely of sets of fields, the applicable fields should be specified,
   and there should be a clear indication that there is no non-field
   content.  Conversely, if there is provision for free-form text as
   well as fields, that should be clearly indicated.  Field syntax
   should be clear and unambiguous, by reference to an external
   specification and/or by provision of a precise specification in the
   RFC containing the registration form.  Refer to [I1.Spec] for some
   additional guidelines for specification of fields.

4. Semantics

   The semantics of each field specified for use in the media type
   should be clearly specified [I1.Spec].

5. Encoding

   Encoding of message subtypes is restricted to the identity encodings
   7bit, 8bit, and binary.  Message subtypes which can use 7bit encoding
   have maximum compatibility and are recommended by [N4.RFC2046].  If
   8bit or binary encoding is required, there should be a clear
   statement to that effect both in the registration form data and in
   the specification text.

6. Number

   In some cases, multiple instances of a particular media type within
   the enclosing multipart/email wrapper are sensible and permissible;
   in other cases no more than a single instance is allowed.  The
   specification SHOULD be very clear on this matter.

Internet-Draft EMAIL Part 3: Media Registration Guidelines     July 2005

   If a media type is to be considered mandatory in multipart/email,
   that MUST be clearly specified and a new specification of
   multipart/email (with a version change) is REQUIRED.

7. Parameters

7.1. Version

   A required "version" parameter is RECOMMENDED.  Such a parameter can
   serve to distinguish versions of the media type which have
   incompatible characteristics.  It is further RECOMMENDED that the
   version parameter be specified as an unsigned decimal integer number
   represented in ASCII digits in order to avoid misinterpretation of
   the value [I1.Spec].

7.1.1. Guidelines for Version Change

   A version value change requires a new specification.  A specification
   revision entailing any of the following means that a new version is
   REQUIRED:

   o addition of a mandatory part (e.g. some field)

   o specification such that existence or content of some part affects
     processing or display of the media type as a whole or of any part
     other than the specific part whose existence or content is
     concerned

   o Once a mandatory part is added to the specification (with a
     corresponding new version), that part MUST NOT subsequently be made
     optional.  That prohibition is necessary to ensure backward
     compatibility of new versions.  Consequently, addition of a
     mandatory part is a change that should not be made lightly.

   A media type definition suitable as an optional part within
   multipart/email does not require a new version of multipart/email
   unless the second item above applies.

7.2. Sequence

   Where multiple instances of a particular media type may be sensible
   in the extensible message format, a required "sequence" parameter is
   also RECOMMENDED.  Such a parameter, ideally having a one-based
   unsigned decimal integer value expressed as ASCII digits can
   facilitate ordering of such types within the enclosing
   multipart/email wrapper by applications without the need to parse
   each individual section and/or apply heuristics.

8. Interoperability

   The registration form interoperability considerations section will
   require some careful thought.  Note that unrecognized message
   subtypes will be treated as application/octet-stream by
   MIME-conforming implementations.

9. Specification of Internationalization

   A media type which addresses internationalization issues SHOULD have
   an Internationalization Considerations section as noted in
   [I2.BCP18].

10. Address Security Issues

   Security issues must be addressed in the specifying document and
   registration form.  A document MAY detail considerations in the form
   and reference that text in a Security Considerations section or vice
   versa.

11. An IANA Considerations Section is Mandatory

   At minimum, a media type registration requires IANA action to
   register the media type upon approval.  If fields are specified,
   entries may need to be made in a registry per [I3.BCP90].  If
   keywords or assigned numbers are specified, a registry may need to be
   amended or established.  These issues MUST be discussed in an IANA
   Considerations section in order to promote interoperability.

12. Security Considerations

   This memo addresses best practice for registration of media types and
   is believed to raise no security issues.

13. Internationalization Considerations

   This memo addresses best practice for registration of media types.
   Some media types may require 8bit or binary transport, which
   conflicts with the [N4.RFC2046] recommendation for use of 7bit
   encoding for message subtypes.  The issue is discussed in section 5
   of this memo.

14. IANA Considerations

   This memo addresses best practice for registration of media types and
   does not itself require any IANA action.

Appendix A. Disclaimers

   This document has exactly one (1) author.

   In spite of the fact that the author's given name may also be the
   surname of other individuals, and the fact that the author's surname
   may also be a given name for some females, the author is, and has
   always been, male.

   The presence of "or she", "/SHE", "each", "their", and "authors"
   (plural) in the boilerplate sections of this document is irrelevant.

   As noted in the "Status of this Memo" section, this document is an
   Internet-Draft, and as such is a "work in progress", not a standard.

   Reference to this document's contents as "this standard" in the
   boilerplate are inappropriate.

   The author of this document is not responsible for the boilerplate
   text.

   Comments regarding the silliness, lack of accuracy, and lack of
   precision of the boilerplate text should be directed to the IESG, not
   to the author.
