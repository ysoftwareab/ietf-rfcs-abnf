Abstract

     As deployment of global IP networks become more widespread, there
     are several challenges that become apparent, one of the more
     important ones being secure access from a users perspective. Based
     on the users service requirements, secure access will have to be
     setup between a multitude of nodes in a distributed fashion. The
     nature of these security requirements may well be real-time and
     dynamic in nature and MUST protect the confidentiality of the user.
     These requirements are clearly manifested in the mobility domain.
     This draft outlines a general purpose Key Exchange framework for
     Network Architectures [KENA] with centralised key generation and
     management tailored for distributed nodes. The draft also describes

Internet-Draft                    KENA                   16 October 1999


     a specific implementation of KENA in the IP mobility domain by
     extending Mobile IP [Perkins96].



1.  Introduction

     IP network deployment has picked up considerable momentum in recent
     times. Whether it the third generation cellular packet networks or
     packet cable based networks, utilization of IP as the choosen layer
     three transport medium for packets brings a host of problems that
     need to be solved. Security is one key area that presents several
     dimensions. A multitude of rich packet based services (mobility
     being one of them) require that users interface with a variety of
     nodes providing these services, exploding the need to dynamically
     setup secure paths. Requirements like LAES (Lawful Authorized
     Electronic Survellience) translate into a centralised key
     management requirement as otherwise the problem of obtaining a
     handle on the security parameters might become insurmountable. A
     requirement to be able to setup on demand services (mobility being
     one) brings a real-time flavor to security.

     KENA is a simple general purpose framework that solves the problem
     of centralised key management and distribution in a dynamic
     fashion. KENA protects the confidentiality of the user.  Key
     exchanges, the basic building block of establishing secure paths,
     for a particular users communication channel is what KENA primarily
     focusses on. KENA fulfills several authentication requirements as
     discussed in Dommety99. The most significant ones being the
     requirement for the mobile node to be able to authenticate the
     credentials of the foreign domain and the requirement that the
     mobile nodes credentials be unforgeable. KENA implementations MAY
     also choose to add value security attributes and policy information
     to key exchange. Implementations of KENA may occur through
     extensions to different protocols.  Mobile IP [Perkins96] is one
     such protocol that may be easily extended to solve requirements in
     the IP mobility domain.

     Several alternate proposals exist for addressing security issues.
     Voluntary tunnelling and IKE [Harkins98] being two of them.  The
     problems associated with these two methods are well articulated in
     McCann99. Additionally, implementing requirements like LAES become
     extremely difficult if not impossible with both the methods
     mentioned above.

2.  Terminology

     This document uses the following terminology:

     SA                  Security Association is the logical term used
                         to capture the shared secret keys, secruity
                         attributes and policy that needs to be defined
                         in order to apply protection to traffic between
                         any two nodes in a network. SPI (defined below)
                         uniquely identifies a SA within the context of
                         a host.


     MN                  Mobile Node [Perkins98]


     HA                  Home Agent [Perkins98]


     FA                  Foreign Agent [Perkins98]


     AAA                 Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting
                         Server


     SPI                 Security Parameters Index is a 32 bit number to
                         index a SA in a database.


3.  Specification Language

     The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
     "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
     this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].


4.  Assumptions

     We assume that a shared secret MUST exist between the user and the
     users home. In the mobile IP case this would be the MN user and HA.
     In addition, in the case of a distributed network as in mobile IP
     wherein the home network and serving network are different, we
     assume that a secure path MUST exist between the foreign domain and
     home domain. KENA distributes keys between the nodes in the serving
     and home network for securing/encrypting the traffic of a user. An
     assummption is made that the nodes within a network MUST be able to
     communicate with each other securely such that keys MAY be

     distributed to them in the first place.


5.  Requirements


5.1.  Generic KENA Requirements

     1- User confidentiality and authentication

     2- Centralised key generation and distribution for user's
     communication channel

     3- Real-time sensitive

     4- Implementable using extensions to existing protocols

5.2.  Mobility Requirements

     One of the important goals for any mobile system is to minimize
     data loss and speed the process of handoff while maintaining a
     secure environment for the different entities (e.g. MN, HA, FA) to
     exchange data and control messages. Handoff process in IP mobility
     has some requirements to perform this process in an efficient and
     secure way. This section describes the list of requirements to
     allow an efficient and secure handoff.  The requirements are stated
     with respect to Home Agent and Foreign Agent in a generic sense.

     1- Mobile nodes and new Foreign domain MUST be authenticated before
     the start of any data sessions.

     2- The MN's and User's  personal information (e.g.USER's NAI , MN's
     IP address) sent to the home subnetwork through the foreign domain
     during initial the registration phase should be completely hidden
     from the foreign domain.

     3- Keys MUST be distributed such that secure paths using the keys
     are established for a particular MN and MUST not be shared by
     another MN.

     4- Layer three encryption is a MUST since not all the access
     technologies support layer two encryption.

     5- Central authority for short session key generation to enable
     easier service management and certain legal requirements.

     6- Proactive key distribution prior to handoff

6.  KENA Framework

     This section describes the general purpose KENA framework and
     solution. KENA relies on the assumption that a shared secret MUST
     exist between a user and the user's home authentication,
     authorization and accounting agency. KENA provides a strategy by
     which the user's home is responsible for generating the keys
     required for securing paths between nodes which provide the user
     his/her services.

     The point of attachment MAY be the home system or a serving system
     other than the home system. A serving system CANNOT be trusted
     until the home authenticates it. KENA assumes that the
     authetication between a home and serving system SHOULD occur
     through SLA or third party certification. Once the serving system
     and home system have a secure link, the home generetes keys and
     SPIs (and MAY potentially security attributes and policies) for use
     by all nodes in the serving and home system between which the users
     traffic will flow.

     This distribution of the information is achieved through extensions
     to existing protocols for service initiation [example Mobile IP].
     It is expected that adding extensions to facilitate KENA philisophy
     would be fairly straighforward to any service initiation type
     protocols.

     Having a central authority for key management provides tremondous
     value when it comes to service management and facilitating
     requirements like LAES. As such the functionality provided by KENA
     fits neatly into the functions that COULD to be provided by a AAA
     server.

Internet-Draft                    KENA                   16 October 1999


     SS1 is a shared secret that is predefined between the MN and HA. A
     corresponding SPI is also predefined. We assume that a secure path
     (SS2) exists between FA and HA. This secure path may exist by
     virtue of SLA or maybe triggered to be setup dynamically by the
     first mobile user who requests service from a particular HA. K1, K2
     & K3 are generated at the user's home and distributed to MN and FA
     using SS1 and SS2. K1 is the key to be used for MN-HA link, K2 is
     the key for FA-HA link and K3 is the key for MN-FA link.

     When the mobile node roams into a foreign domain it will receive an
     agent advertisement from the foreign agent. The agent advertisement
     carries information which specifies the identity of the foreign
     agent and foreign domain such as the foreign agent IP address
     [Perkins96].

     Three new extensions to mobile IP are defined as a part of this
     draft. The extensions are IP extension, Session SA extension and
     Layer 2 address extension. In addition changes to the home IP
     address field in the mobile IP registration message and changes to
     the NAI extension [Calhoun99a] are required.


7.1.  MN Considerations

     When the mobile node receives the agent advertisement and finds
     that it has moved to a new foreign domain it initiates the
     registration process by sending a Registration Request to its home
     domain. The Home IP address field is blanked out by using TBD
     value, the NAI extension encrypted, IP extension encrypted, and
     Layer 2 extension encrypted. All encryption MUST be executed using
     SS1.

     If the MN has an IP address then it MUST include the IP extension,
     else the extension MUST be dropped. The NAI extension and the Layer
     2 extension MUST be included.



7.2.  FA Considerations for Registration Request

     The FA recieving this information cannot store the MN's Home IP
     Address or NAI since they are encrypted. FA simply relays the
     message onto to the Home Agent. Behavior of the FA is otherwise the
     same as specified in Perkins86. This ensures that MN/mobile user's
     identity is fully hidden from the FA until the HA authenticates the
     FA.

     FA relays the registration request over a secure link to the home.

Internet-Draft                    KENA                   16 October 1999


     The existence of such a secure link (SS2 shown in Figure 1)
     signifies that the HA and FA are aware of each other as trusted
     parties. Should such a secure link be absent, then the MN
     registration request SHOULD trigger an IKE exchange between the FA
     and HA such that they authenticate each other and establish a
     secure link.



7.3.  HA Considerations for Registration Request and Registration Reply

     Receipt of the user's Registration Request using the SA between the
     Home and Foreign domain signifies that the FA is a trusted party.
     The HA then authenticates the user by decoding the encrypted
     information in the registration request and extensions using SS1.

     The HA then MUST interface with a key distribution center and
     obtain three keys and corresponding SPIs. K2 and its corresponding
     SPI are for all future communication between the HA and FA for the
     particular MN registering. K3 and its corresponding SPI are for the
     purposes of the MN - FA link.  K1 and its corresponding SPI are for
     the purposes of the MN - HA link.

     Generation of the keys ensures that the HA interfaces with the
     Central Key Distribution Center (CKDC). Distribution of the keys
     and SPI occurs as follows. The HA MUST attach four Session SA
     extensions to the Registration reply. The first extension MUST
     carry K2 in the clear. The second extension MUST carry K3 in the
     clear. The first and second extension is sent in the clear since
     the HA-FA link is secure.

     The third extension MUST carry K3 encrypted using SS1. The fourth
     extension MUST carry K1 encrypted using SS1. The third and fourth
     extensions are intended for delivery to mobile node and are
     encrypted since MN-FA link is not secure. HA MUST also attach the
     layer 2 extension in the clear. The MN's IP address MUST be in the
     clear for use by the FA. All other functions of the HA are as
     defined in Perkins86.



7.4.  FA Considerations for Registration Reply

The FA upon receipt of the the Registration reply MUST strip the first 2
Session SA extensions. K2 and its SPI SHOULD be used for all further
communication with the HA for traffic pertaining to the particular MN.
Key K3 and corresponding SPI MAY be used for all communication with the
MN. It is expected that certain technologies may provide layer 2

encrption and therefore choose not to implement MN-FA layer 3 security
from a performance perspective. The FA forwards the third and fourth
extensions to the MN in the Registration Reply.

The FA is able to identify the mobile node since it now has the MN's
Home IP address and layer 2 extension from the HA.

     In the mechanism described above, the key generation and
     distribution has occured during registration. This adds great value
     from a handoff perspective where in the requirements are real-time
     sensitive. Keys are setup in a single step as opposed to a two step
     process that will be required with a a solution using IKE.

     Figure 3: KENA with AAA


     The implementation of KENA here is identical to the implementation
     in the mobile IP case. The MN MUST have a predefined shared secret
     SS1 with the Home AAA server. There MUST be a secure path between
     the Foreign AAA and Home AAA (SS2 in this example). The MNs
     critical information MUST be encrypted during the registration
     process and the secure link between the FAAA and HAAA is used to
     distribute the keys K1, K2 and K3. An implicit assumption here is
     that the links between the FAAA and FA and that between the HA and
     HAAA are secure.

     The detailed message specification for this section is deferred to
     a future date.

        Figure 4: KENA with AAA flows

     Figure 4 shows the message flow from the MN to HA and back to
     the MN passing through FAAA and HAAA [Calhoun99b].

       (a) The MN sends a Registration Request to FA with all of its
           personal information (e.r. MN's Home IP address, User's
           NAI etc.) encrypted using SS1.
       (b) The FA receives the Registration Request and creates AMR
           [Calhoun98] message. It then forwards the AMR to FAAA
           using the secure link (between FA and FAAA). The user's
           personal information is still encrypted (using SS1)
           inside the AMR.
       (c) The FAAA forwards the AMR to the appropriate HAAA using
           the secure tunnell (SS2). As before, the user's personal
           information is still encrypted (using SS1) inside
           the AMR.

       (d) The HAAA forwards the AMR to the appropriate HA using
           the secure link (between HAAA and HA).
       (e) The HA then decrypts the user's personal information
           using SS1. It then proceeds with the registration process
           which includes authenticating the credentials of both the
           MN and the foeign domain (FA, in this case). It also
           interfaces with CKDC and gets all the keys (K1, K2
           and K3). HA next creates the AMA [Calhoun98] message and
           sends it to HAAA using the secure link (between HA and
           HAAA). It sends K2, K3 in the clear and K1, K3 encrypted
           using SS1.
       (f) The HAAA forwards the AMA to HAAA using the secure tunnel
           (SS2).
       (g) The FAAA forwards the AMA message to FA using the secure link
           (between FAAA and FA).
       (h) Upon receiving the AMA, the FA creates the Registration Reply
           and sends it to MN. The Registration Reply includes the
           encrypted keys K1 and K3. The FA also receives K2 and K3 in
           the clear (using SS2). The MN at this point has esablished a
           session security association with the FA and HA.
