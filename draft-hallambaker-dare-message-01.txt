1.  Introduction

   This document describes the Data At Rest Encryption (DARE) message
   syntax.  This syntax is used to digitally sign, digest, authenticate,
   or encrypt arbitrary message content.

   The DARE Message syntax is based on a subset of the JSON Web
   Signature [RFC7515] and JSON Web Encryption [RFC7516] standards and
   shares many fields and semantics.  The processing model and data
   structures have been simplified to remove as many redundant features
   and alternative means of specifying the same content.

   An important innovation in the DARE message format is the separation
   of key exchange and data encryption operations so that a Master Key
   (MK) established in a single exchange to be applied to multiple octet
   sequences.  This means that a public key operation may be used to
   encrypt multiple parts of the same message or to multiple messages.

   To maintain the security of the cryptographic algorithm, each octet
   sequence is encrypted under a different encryption key (and IV if
   required) derived from the Master Key by means of a salt.  Depending
   on application needs, the salt may be explicit or implicit.  An
   explicit salt is an opaque sequence of octets prepended to the data
   item.  An implicit salt is an octet sequence constructed by
   application specific means such as the sequence number of a message
   or the byte position of a field in a file.

1.1.  Existing approaches

   Traditional cryptographic containers describe the application of a
   single key exchange to a single octet sequence.  Examples include
   PCKS#7/CMS [RFC2315] , OpenPGP [RFC4880] and JSON Web Encryption
   [RFC7516] .

   To encrypt a message using RSA, the creator first generates a random
   encryption key and initialization vector (IV).  The encryption key is
   encrypted under the public key of each recipient to create a per-
   recipient decryption entry.  The encryption key, plaintext and IV are
   used to generate the ciphertext (figure 1).

   [[This figure is not viewable in this format.  The figure is
   available at http://mathmesh.com/Documents/draft-hallambaker-dare-
   message.html [2].]]


   Monolithic Key Exchange and Encrypt

   This approach is adequate for the task of encrypting a single octet
   stream.  It is less than satisfactory when encrypting multiple octet
   streams or very long streams for which a rekeying operation is
   desirable.

1.2.  The DARE Approach

   The DARE key exchange begins with the same key exchange used to
   produce the CEK in JWE but instead of using the CEK to encipher data
   directly, it is used as one of the inputs to a Key Derivation
   Function (KDF) that is used to derive parameters for each block of
   data to be encrypted.  To avoid the need to introduce additional
   terminology, the term 'CEK' is still used to describe the output of
   the key agreement algorithm (including key unwrapping if required)
   but it is more appropriately described as a Master Key (figure 2).

   [[This figure is not viewable in this format.  The figure is
   available at http://mathmesh.com/Documents/draft-hallambaker-dare-
   message.html [3].]]


   Exchange of Master Key

   A Master Key may be used to encrypt any number of data items.  Each
   data item is encrypted under a different encryption key and IV (if
   required).  This data is derived from the Master Key using the HKDF
   function [RFC5869] using a different salt for each data item and
   separate info tags for each cryptographic function (figure 3).

   Data item encryption under Master Key and per-item salt.

   This approach to encryption offers considerably greater flexibility
   allowing the same format for data item encryption to be applied at
   the transport, message or field level.

2.  Definitions

2.1.  Related Specifications

   The DARE message format is based on the following existing standards
   and specifications.

   Object serialization  The JSON-B [draft-hallambaker-jsonbcd] encoding
      is used for object serialization.  This encoding is an extension
      of the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC7159] .

   Message syntax  The cryptographic processing model is based on JSON
      Web Signature (JWS) [RFC7515] , JSON Web Encryption (JWE)
      [RFC7516] and JSON Web Key (JWK) [RFC7517] .

   Cryptographic primitives.  The HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key
      Derivation Function [RFC5869] and Advanced Encryption Standard
      (AES) Key Wrap with Padding Algorithm [RFC3394] are used.

      The Uniform Data Fingerprint method of presenting data digests is
      used for key identifiers and other purposes
      [draft-hallambaker-udf] .

   Cryptographic algorithms  The cryptographic algorithms and
      identifiers described in JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) [RFC7518] are
      used together with additional algorithms as defined in the JSON
      Object Signing and Encryption IANA registry [IANAJOSE] .

   Management Mode", "Key Encryption", "Direct Key Agreement", "Key
   Agreement with Key Wrapping" and "Direct Encryption" are defined in
   the JWE specification [RFC7516] .

   The terms "Authentication", "Ciphertext", "Digital Signature",
   "Encryption", "Initialization Vector (IV)", "Message Authentication
   Code (MAC)", "Plaintext" and "Salt" are defined by the Internet
   Security Glossary, Version 2 [RFC4949] .

3.  Applications

3.1.  Message Types

3.1.1.  Consolidated Messages

   A consolidated DARE message contains the ciphertext and
   authentication data for a data object together with the key exchange
   information necessary for the intended recipient(s) to process it.

   Consolidated messages provide the same functionality as traditional
   PKJCS#7/CMS and OpenPGP message formats and may be used as a one-for-
   one replacement.

3.1.2.  Related Messages

   A set of DARE messages are related if they share the same key
   exchange information.

   Related messages allow a single key exchange to be amortized over a
   collection of data items.  This is particularly useful when a large
   collection of short data items is required such as in a server log or
   a chat-room transcript.

3.1.3.  Detached Messages

   A detached DARE message contains only the ciphertext and
   authentication data for a data object and does not provide any key
   exchange information.





Hallam-Baker            Expires January 14, 2019                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                DARE Message                     July 2018


   The use of detached messages in a protocol allows key exchange
   information and message data to be passed to a recipient separately,
   possibly over different channels or even with entirely different
   partners.

   For example, a service returning the last hundred entries from a log
   file encrypted as a series of DARE related messages need only provide
   the key exchange data once.

3.1.4.  Annotated Messages

   An annotated DARE message contains a message header with encrypted
   metadata in addition to an encrypted body.  The use of annotated
   messages allows a receiver to process message data and metadata
   separately.

   For example, a mail application typically provides users with a
   display showing a short summary of the messages received (sender,
   date, subject, etc.).  Encrypting the metadata to be shown to the
   user in the summary display separately from the message body allows
   this data to be presented to the user without the need to download
   any part of the message bodies

3.1.5.  Proxy Re-encryption

   The ability to re-use the output of a key exchange is of particular
   importance when using proxy re-encryption or distributed key
   generation as completing each key agreement incurs an interaction
   with the key server.

3.2.  Additional Use Cases

3.2.1.  Streaming data

   The DARE message format supports encryption and decryption in
   'streaming mode' in which blocks of output data are emitted as the
   input is presented.

   This allows synchronous communications (e.g. video, voice) to be
   supported and permits files of arbitrary size to be encrypted with
   finite state.  It is not necessary to buffer the entire plaintext or
   ciphertext before generating a message.

3.2.2.  Information Erasure by Key Deletion

   Overwriting a DARE salt value prevents decryption of the
   corresponding data unless the salt can be recovered.  Use of a
   suitably large random salt allows erasure of the salt to be

Internet-Draft                DARE Message                     July 2018


   considered equivalent to erasure of the message data.  For example,
   if a salt of 128 random bits and an encryption algorithm of at least
   128 bits are used, the work factor for decryption will be O(2^128)
   even if the decryption key is compromised.

3.2.3.  Field level encryption

   The DARE key exchange and data item encoding may be applied to
   encrypt multiple fields in a single file under a Common Encryption
   Key. Field level encryption is particularly useful in database and
   spreadsheet applications.

4.  Message Format

   A consolidated DARE message is a sequence of four parts as follows.

   Header  Information a reader requires to being processing the message
      body.

      By definition, the header of a consolidated message contains the
      key agreement information and the header of a detached message
      does not.  The header may also be used to specify content metadata
      (such as the data type) and encrypted annotations.

   Body  The data block

   Trailer  Information a reader requires to complete processing the
      message body that is not provided in the header.

      A detached DARE message has the same sequence of four parts but
      the header part is empty.  The header being communicated out-of-
      band with respect to the message to which it appears.

4.1.  Encodings

   A DARE message MAY be presented in JSON encoding or a compact
   encoding based on JSON-B.

4.1.1.  JSON

   The DARE message is encoded as JSON sequence with up to three
   entries.  The position of the item in the sequence specifies its
   function.  Thus the Header entry MAY be empty but MUST not be absent.

   Header  The header is encoded as a JSON object

   Body  The body is encoded as a base64url encoded string

Internet-Draft                DARE Message                     July 2018


   Trailer  The trailer is encoded as a JSON object

   For example, the following sequence is a JSON encoded message with an
   empty header and trailer and a salt and body of zero length:

   [ {}, "", {} ]

                                 Figure 1

4.1.2.  JSON-B

   JSON-B Encoding provides a more compact representation and in
   particular, allows ciphertext to be presented in binary form as
   opposed to Base-64 encoding.  Note that JSON-B encoding is a superset
   of JSON, a JSON-B decoder will be able to decode either format
   without additional tagging to specify which format is being used.

   The square braces used to specify a JSON sequence MUST be present
   when a DARE Message is embedded in a JSON-B encoded object but MAY be
   omitted in situations where no ambiguity arises from doing so.  For
   example, when presenting a DARE Message as a standalone file or in a
   DARE Container.

4.1.3.  Application Directed Encoding

   Applications MAY define their own encoding mechanisms to suit their
   needs.

5.  Processing Model

   The DARE processing model is based on the model in JWE [RFC7516] with
   the following extensions:

   o  Support for multiple recipients

   o  Support for multiple message bodies encrypted under keys derived
      from a single key exchange.

   o  Signature and encryption are supported in a single format rather
      than separately.

   o  Authentication tags are appended to the end of the message body.

   o  Message Authentication Codes are supported as a means of

5.1.  Consolidated Message Generation

   Two generation modes are supported:

   Buffered  The data body is buffered in memory while the data header
      is completed.

   Streaming  The DARE message is generated in a single pass.

   Use of buffered mode avoids the need for data chunking and allows
   messages to provide all the information required for processing in
   the message header.

   Use of streamed mode avoids the need to buffer the data body while
   assembly of the header is completed.  This allows messages of
   arbitrary size to be processed with fixed resources.

5.1.1.  Message Header

   The Message header contains the key exchange information which MAY be
   shared by multiple related messages,

5.1.1.1.  Signatures and Signers

   If the message is to be authenticated by means of a digital
   signature, the Header MUST contain either a Signatures field or a
   Signers field but not both.

   The Signatures field contains the actual signature value which cannot
   usually be calculated until processing of the message body is
   complete.  The Signers field contains all the information from a
   signature except for the signature itself.  This allows a verifier to
   perform decryption and signer verification processing in parallel and
   to reject a message that is not signed by an accepted signer before
   completing processing of the message body.

5.1.1.2.  Key Exchange

   The DARE key exchange is based on the JWE key exchange except that
   encryption modes are intentionally limited and the output of the key
   exchange is the DARE Master Key rather than the Content Encryption
   Key.

   A DARE Key Exchange MAY contain any number of Recipient entries, each
   providing a means of decrypting the Master Key using a different
   private key.

Internet-Draft                DARE Message                     July 2018


   If the Key Exchange mechanism supports message recovery, Direct Key
   Agreement is used, in all other cases, Key Wrapping is used.

   This approach allows messages with one intended recipient to be
   handled in the exact same fashion as messages with multiple
   recipients.  While this does require an additional key wrapping
   operation, that could be avoided if a message has exactly one
   intended recipient, this is offset by the reduction in code
   complexity.

   If the key exchange algorithm does not support message recovery (e.g.
   Diffie Hellman and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman), the HKDF Extract-
   and-Expand Key Derivation Function is used to derive a master key
   using the following info tag:

   "dare-master" [64 61 72 65 2d 6d 61 73 74 65 72]  Key derivation info
      field used when deriving a master key from the output of a key
      exchange.

   The master key length is the maximum of the key size of the
   encryption algorithm specified by the key exchange header, the key
   size of the MAC algorithm specified by the key exchange header (if
   used) and 256.

5.1.1.3.  Key Identifier

   The JWE/JWS specifications define a kid field for use as a key
   identifier but not how the identifier itself is constructed.  All
   DARE key identifiers are either UDF key fingerprints
   [draft-hallambaker-udf] or Group Key Identifiers.

   A UDF fingerprint is formed as the digest of an IANA content type and
   the digested data.  A UDF key fingerprint is formed with the content
   type application/pkix-keyinfo and the digested data is the ASN.1 DER
   encoded PKIX certificate keyInfo sequence for the corresponding
   public key.

   A Group Key Identifier has the form <fingerprint>@<domain>.  Where
   <fingerprint> is a UDF key fingerprint and <domain> is the DNS
   address of a service that provides the encryption service to support
   decryption by group members.

5.1.2.  Enhanced Data Sequence

   A DARE Enhanced Data Segment is an atomic unit that contains a salt
   and the result(s) of applying the salt and Master Key to a plaintext
   under the enhancement mode specified in the key exchange.  The
   following enhancement modes are supported:

Internet-Draft                DARE Message                     July 2018


   Plaintext  The EDS consists of a plaintext.

   Authenticated  The EDS consists of a plaintext with an authentication
      tag appended to the end.

   Encrypted  The EDS consists of a ciphertext only

   Encrypted and Authenticated  The EDS consists of a ciphertext with an
      authentication tag appended to the end.

   In each case the encryption and/or authentication algorithms and all
   associated parameters (key size, output length) are specified in the
   associated key exchange header.

   A DARE message MAY contain multiple Enhanced Data Sequences.  The
   message body, cloaked headers, annotations and signature values are
   all presented as Enhanced Data Sequences.

   The message body is distinct from all other Enhanced Data Sequences
   in that each message MUST have exactly one message body and only the
   message body can be signed.  Additionally, when the compact encoding
   is used, it is the only Enhanced Data Sequence that can be of
   variable length.

5.1.2.1.  Salt

   A salt is a sequence of zero or more octets that is unique within the
   scope of a Master Key.

   Generators SHOULD NOT generate salt values that exceed 1024 octets.

   The salt value is opaque to the DARE encoding but MAY be used to
   encode application specific semantics including:

   o  Frame number to allow reassembly of a data sequence split over a
      sequence of messages which may be delivered out of order.

   o  Transmit the Master Key in the manner of a Kerberos ticket to
      allow some (but not necessarily all) to avoid the need to perform
      a key exchange.

   o  Identify the Master Key under which the Enhanced Data Sequence was
      generated.

   o  Enable erasure of the encrypted data plaintext by erasure of the
      encryption key.

Internet-Draft                DARE Message                     July 2018


   For data erasure to be effective, the salt must be constructed so
   that the difficulty of recovering the key is sufficiently high that
   it is infeasible.  For most purposes, a salt with 128 bits of
   appropriately random data will be sufficient.

5.1.2.2.  Key Derivation

   Encryption and/or authentication keys are derived from the Master Key
   using a Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function as follows:

   1.  The Master Key and salt value are used to extract the PRK
       (pseudorandom key)

   2.  The PRK is used to derive the algorithm keys using the
       application specific information input for that key type.

   The application specific information inputs are:

   "dare-encrypt" [64 61 72 65 2d 65 6e 63 72 79 70 74]  To generate an
      encryption or encryption with authentication key.

   "dare-iv" [64 61 72 65 2d 65 6e 63 72 79 70 74]  To generate an
      initialization vector.

   "dare-mac" [dare-mac]  To generate a Message Authentication Code key.

5.1.2.3.  Content

   The content of an Enhanced Data Sequence is the plaintext or
   ciphertext with the appended authentication tag as directed by the
   enhancement mode.

   Support for enhancement of unbuffered streaming data presents
   implementations with two cases of interest:

5.1.2.3.1.  Known Length

   If the length of the body is known in advance of enhancement the
   generator can calculate the final length of the Enhanced Data Segment
   before encryption begins.  This allows encryption of (e.g.) data
   files as a single data-last production when the compact encoding is
   being used.

5.1.2.3.2.  Unknown Length

   If the final length of the body is not known in advance of
   enhancement the generator must either buffer the output data in
   memory before generation or use an encoding that permits indefinite

   length octet sequences to be represented.  In the compact encoding,
   this means a (possibly zero length) sequence of data-chunk
   productions terminated by a single data-last production

5.1.3.  Trailer

   The trailer only contains information when the message is
   authenticated by means of a signature.

5.1.3.1.  Signatures

   A list of message signature values.

   If the message header contains a Signer field, the trailer MUST
   contain a Signatures field giving the corresponding signature values.

5.2.  Consolidated Message Recovery

   Decryption and verification is the opposite of the generation process

5.2.1.  Verify signers

   Recipients MAY verify that the message signatures are adequate to
   meet the requirements of the security policy at any point in message
   recovery.

   The recipient determines which signer or signature entries are
   appropriate to their needs and if so, which digest algorithms are to
   be applied to the message plaintext.

5.2.2.  Match recipient info

   The first step in recovering the master key is to determine which (if
   any) of the recipient entries can be used for decryption by examining
   the kid fields.

5.2.3.  Recover Master Key

   Having identified the key exchange to use, the Master key.

5.2.4.  Process Enhanced Data Sequences

   Having recovered the Master Key, the recipient can decrypt whichever
   Enhanced Data Sequences it requires.

Internet-Draft                DARE Message                     July 2018


5.2.5.  Signature validation

   If validation of one or more signature entries is required, the
   recipient recovers the signature value from the corresponding
   Enhanced Data Sequences and performs signature verification according
   to the specified algorithm.

5.3.  Detached Messages

   Processing of a detached message is the same as for a consolidated
   message except for the fact that at least some of the header
   information is passed out of band with respect to the message.  There
   are thus two sets of headers:

   Context Header  The header that contains the key exchange (passed out
      of band with respect to the message).

   Message Header  Additional header data contained in the message
      itself.

   Message headers take precedence over context headers.  Thus if the
   encryption algorithm field 'enc' is specified in both places, the
   value specified in the message header takes precedence.

5.4.  Cloaked Messages

   A cloaked message is a DARE message that contains a Cloaked field in
   the header.

   Implementations MAY support generation and parsing of cloaked
   messages.  Implementations SHOULD NOT generate and MAY reject nested
   cloaked headers unless specifically directed by an application
   specification.

   The use of cloaked headers allows a second layer of key agreement to
   be specified within the first.  The message body is always encrypted
   under the Master Key corresponding to the innermost key exchange.

   Enhanced Data Sequences that are contained in a cloaked header are
   encrypted under the master key contained in that header.

   Since the means of public key exchange is determined by the key
   identifier of the recipient key, it is only necessary to specify the
   algorithms used for key wrapping and derivation.

   The default (and so far only) algorithm is kwd-aes-sha2-256-256.

   Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Key Wrap with Padding Algorithm
   [RFC3394] is used to wrap the Master Exchange Key. AES 256 is used.

   HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function [RFC5869] is
   used for key derivation.  SHA-2-256 is used for the hash function.

7.  Reference

   A DARE Message consists of a Header, an Enhanced Data Sequence (EDS)
   and an optional trailer.  This section describes the JSON data fields
   used to construct headers, trailers and complete messages.

   Wherever possible, fields from JWE, JWS and JWK have been used.  In
   these cases, the fields have the exact same semantics.  Note however
   that the classes in which these fields are presented have different
   structure and nesting.

7.1.  Message Classes

   A DARE Message contains a single DAREMessageSequence in either the
   JSON or Compact serialization as directed by the protocol in which it
   is applied.

7.1.1.  Structure: DAREMessageSequence

   A DARE Message containing Header, EDS and Trailer in JSON object
   encoding.  Since a DAREMessage is almost invariably presented in JSON
   sequence or compact encoding, use of the DAREMessage subclass is
   preferred.

   Although a DARE Message is functionally an object, it is serialized
   as an ordered sequence.  This ensures that the message header field
   will always precede the body in a serialization, this allowing
   processing of the header information to be performed before the
   entire body has been received.

   Header: DAREHeader (Optional)  The message header.  May specify the
      key exchange data, pre-signature or signature data, cloaked
      headers and/or encrypted data sequences.

   Body: Binary (Optional)  The message body

Internet-Draft                DARE Message                     July 2018


   Trailer: DARETrailer (Optional)  The message trailer.  If present,
      this contains the signature.

7.2.  Header and Trailer Classes

   A DARE Message sequence MUST contain a (possibly empty) DAREHeader
   and MAY contain a DARETrailer.

7.2.1.  Structure: DARETrailer

   A DARE Message Trailer

   Signatures: DARESignature [0..Many]  A list of signatures.  A message
      trailer MUST NOT contain a signatures field if the header contains
      a signatures field.

7.2.2.  Structure: DAREHeader

   Inherits: DARETrailer

   A DARE Message Header.  Since any field that is present in a trailer
   MAY be placed in a header instead, the message header inherits from
   the trailer.

   EncryptionAlgorithm: String (Optional)  The encryption algorithm as
      specified in JWE

   AuthenticationAlgorithm: String (Optional)  Message Authentication
      Code algorithm

   Cloaked: Binary (Optional)  If present in a header or trailer,
      specifies an encrypted data block containing additional header
      fields whose values override those specified in the message and
      context headers.

      When specified in a header, a cloaked field MAY be used to conceal
      metadata (content type, compression) and/or to specify an
      additional layer of key exchange.  That applies to both the
      Message body and to headers specified within the cloaked header.

      Processing of cloaked data is described in?

   ContentType: String (Optional)  The content type field as specified
      in JWE

   EDSS: Binary [0..Many]  If present, the Encrypted Data Segments field
      contains a sequence of Encrypted Data Segments encrypted under the

      message Master Key. The interpretation of these fields is
      application specific.

   Signers: DARESigner [0..Many]  A list of 'presignature'

   Recipients: DARERecipient [0..Many]  A list of recipient key exchange
      information blocks.

7.3.  Cryptographic Data

   DARE Message uses the same fields as JWE and JWS but with different
   structure.  In particular, DARE messages MAY have multiple recipients
   and multiple signers.

7.3.1.  Structure: DARESigner

   The signature value

   Dig: String (Optional)  Digest algorithm hint.  Specifying the digest
      algorithm to be applied to the message body allows the body to be
      processed in streaming mode.

   Alg: String (Optional)  Key exchange algorithm

   KeyIdentifier: String (Optional)  Key identifier of the signature
      key.

   Certificate: X509Certificate (Optional)  PKIX certificate of signer.

   Path: X509Certificate (Optional)  PKIX certificates that establish a
      trust path for the signer.

7.3.2.  Structure: X509Certificate

   X5u: String (Optional)  URL identifying an X.509 public key
      certificate

   X5: Binary (Optional)  An X.509 public key certificate

7.3.3.  Structure: DARESignature

   Inherits: DARESigner

   The signature value

   SignatureValue: Binary (Optional)  The signature value as an Enhanced
      Data Sequence under the message Master Key.

   Recipient information

   KeyIdentifier: String (Optional)  Key identifier for the encryption
      key.

      The Key identifier MUST be either a UDF fingerprint of a key or a
      Group Key Identifier

   The key agreement value is used as the input to a HKDF key derivation
   function with the info parameter "master".

   To create the first EDS, a salt value is assigned.  In this case a
   single octet with the value '01'.  The salt value is then used to
   create the encryption key and IV as follows:

   Salt:
   Example.DareEDSSalt.ToStringBase16FormatHex()

   Encryption Key:
   Example.DareMessageKeyEncrypt.ToStringBase16FormatHex()

   IV:
   Example.DareMessageKeyIV.ToStringBase16FormatHex()

                                 Figure 11

   The output sequence is the salt followed by the ciphertext:
