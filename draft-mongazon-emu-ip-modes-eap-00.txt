                   IP Connectivity modes Hint for EAP
                   draft-mongazon-emu-ip-modes-eap-00

Abstract

   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is defined in [RFC3748].
   This document defines a mechanism that allows an access network to
   provide IP connectivity modes hints to an EAP peer -- the end of the
   link that responds to the authenticator.  The purpose is to allow the
   EAP peer in executing in a reliable and efficient manner the IP
   connectivity step as soon as the authentication phase completes.
   This is useful in situations where a peer and the networks it visits
   support various IP connectivity modes.  Without the hint, such a peer
   might fail or take some time to select a valid IP connectivity mode
   on the visited network.  With the help of the hint, a visited network
   provides the peer with a list of supported IP connectivity modes and
   allows it to execute successfully the convenient IP connectivity as
   soon as the authentication is complete.  The hint is particularly
   useful when users are performing vertical handovers through different
   network technologies such as wireless ones.

Internet-Draft                                              October 2010


1.  Introduction

   Current wireless networks, such as IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.16, 3GPP2
   and 3GPP-LTE, provide IP connectivity over secured (authenticated/
   encrypted) access to the network infrastructure.  The Extensible
   Authentication Protocol (EAP), defined in [RFC3748], is used to
   authenticate users (EAP peers), grant or deny their entry to the
   wireless access network (EAP authenticator), and to generate
   Extensible Master Key for use by the EAP peers.

   Once EAP authentication is complete, users continue with IP
   connectivity setup.  Such a setup may vary depending on the network
   technology and architecture.  In particular, there is no single nor
   common IP connectivity setup that would work for any wireless
   network.  For example a network might support a regular DHCPv4
   [RFC2131] connectivity while another would only support IPv6
   connectivity using RS/RA [RFC4861] or DHCPv6 [RFC3315].  As a
   consequence, although EAP authentication might succeed, IP
   connectivity setup might either fail or lack of performance and
   efficiency due to the incompatibility or slow convergence between IP
   connectivity modes supported by the user terminal (EAP peer) on one
   hand and the network on the other hand (EAP authenticator).  Such a
   drawback can be observed in vertical handover situations where a user
   terminal connects to a visited network that is of different kind than
   its usual home network.

   This document defines a mechanism that allows the access network (EAP
   authenticator) to provide an EAP peer with IP connectivity modes
   hint, possibly including additional information and/or options
   related to an IP connectivity mode and key generation procedures.
   The IP connectivity modes information is sent to the EAP peer in an
   EAP-Request/Identity message by appending it after the displayable
   message and a NUL character.  This mechanism may assist the peer in
   selecting the appropriate IP connectivity mode (and options) to
   ensure success and efficiency of IP connectivity setup including
   particular key generation procedures associated with each mode.  If
   the IP connectivity modes information is present, the peer selects
   the mode among modes proposed by the access network and according to
   its local capabilities.  If the peer does not find a supported or
   suited mode within the set proposed by the access network, it
   discards and log the event.  If the peer finds an acceptable
   connectivity mode within the set proposed by the access network, it
   enters the selected mode procedure as soon as EAP authentication has
   complete.  Should the selected connectivity mode fail, the peer might
   either retry it or use an alternate mode from the set proposed by the
   access network.  Section 2 describes the required behavior of
   implementations, including the format for IP connectivity modes hint.

2.  Implementation requirements

   The EAP authenticator MAY send IP connectivity modes hint to the peer
   in the initial EAP-Request/Identity.  If hint is not sent initially
   (such as when the EAP authenticator does not support this
   specification), then the EAP peer may select a default mode that is
   network or implementation dependent.  If hint is sent, the EAP peer
   selects the most convenient mode according to its own criteria.  Such
   criteria might be related to software capabilities of the user
   terminal and/or end-user requirements.  EAP authenticators shall not
   propose in hint an IP connectivity mode that is not effectively
   supported by the network.  Both EAP peer and authenticators might
   manage the supported connectivity modes in a dynamic manner.  For
   example, user-terminal software supporting a particular IP
   connectivity mode might be loaded dynamically according to modes
   proposed by an authenticator.  Similarly, authenticators might
   dynamically load software to handle a particular mode prior to
   advertise its support through the connectivity modes hint.

   As noted in [RFC3748], Section 3.1, the minimum EAP MTU size is 1020
   octets.  EAP does not support fragmentation of EAP-Request/Identity
   messages, so the maximum length of the IP connectivity modes hint is
   limited by the link MTU.

2.1.  Packet Format

   The IP connectivity modes hint information is placed after the
   displayable string and a NUL-character in the EAP-Request/Identity.
   The following ABNF [RFC5234] defines an IPmodes attribute for
   presenting the IP connectivity modes hint information.  The
   attribute's value consists of a set of predefined IP connectivity
   mode names separated by a semicolon.  The predefined names set can be
   extended in future release of the draft to adapt to new network
   protocols and architecture.

3.  Security Considerations

   IP connectivity modes hint information refers to standard procedures
   supported by an EAP authenticator.  References to standard procedures
   shall not be considered as a private information from authenticator
   point of view.  Although it can reveal network capabilities to
   support a given standard, such a support is generally required and
   claimed depending on the network access.  Thus the hint information
   should not be considered as compromising user nor network privacy.
