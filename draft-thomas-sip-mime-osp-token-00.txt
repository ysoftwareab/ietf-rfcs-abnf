                  The application/osp-token MIME type

STATUS OF THIS MEMO

   This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with
   all provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups. Note that
   other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-
   Drafts.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
   months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents
   at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as work in progress.

1. Abstract

   The Open Settlement Protocol (OSP)[1], an open standard from the
   European Telecommunications Standards Institute, specifies a means
   by which IP telephony equipment in one administrative domain may
   request access to IP telephony equipment (including, but not limited
   to: Gateways, Proxy Servers, Gatekeepers, etc.) in another
   administrative domain. OSP grants such access by returning
   authorization tokens, which must then be passed to the destination
   IP telephony device during call signaling. In order to support
   access control via OSP, IP telephony signaling protocols must be
   capable of carrying these authorization tokens in an interoperable
   way. This memo defines just such a method for protocols, such as the
   Session Initiation Protocol[2], that can support carriage of MIME
   types during call signaling. This memo conforms to the requirements
   for MIME type registration defined in RFC 2048[3].

Internet Draft      The application/osp-token MIME type           July 2000



   MIME subtype name: osp-token

   Required parameters: none 

   Optional parameters: 

      osp-token-format: a value of "asn.1" indicates the token contents
         use the ASN.1 format defined in Annex D, section D.2.1 of the OSP
         specification; a value of "xml" indicates the token contents use
         the XML format defined in Annex D, section D.2.2 of the OSP
         specification, and a value of "bxml" indicates the token contents
         use the Binary XML format defined in Annex D, section D.2.3 of the
         OSP specification. In the absence of any value for this parameter,
         the token contents shall be self identifying or otherwise
         understood by appropriate parties.

      osp-token-version: a character string indicating the earliest
         revision of the OSP specification to which the token contents
         conform. In the absence of any value for this parameter, the
         token contents shall conform to version "2.1.0" of the OSP
         specification.

   Encoding considerations: OSP tokens are normally carried as binary data
      by the call signaling protocol. Call signaling protocols which cannot
      reliably transfer binary data must use alternate encodings such as
      base-64, in which case standard MIME content-encoding parameters may
      indicate the particular encoding.

   Security considerations: OSP tokens are intended to provide access
      control to resources of other administrative domains, and, as such,
      are inherently designed to address security concerns. For that
      reason, OSP tokens are digitally signed and, optionally, encrypted,
      as defined in the OSP specification.

   Interoperability considerations: The means and/or algorithms by which
      a receiving system determines whether or not an OSP token is valid
      are a local matter. However, at a minimum, receiving systems should
      verify the digital signature of the token, and they should ensure
      that any call details included in the token contents (e.g. called
      number, calling number, etc.) are appropriate for the contemplated
      call.
