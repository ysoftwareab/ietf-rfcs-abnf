          Status of this Memo


          This memo defines an experimental version of an ISO
          Transport Management Information Base for use with network
          management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.  This memo
          does not specify a standard for the Internet community.
          However, after experimentation, if sufficient consensus is
          reached in the Internet community, then a subsequent
          revision of this document may be placed in the Internet-
          standard MIB.  This draft document will be submitted to the
          RFC editor as a protocol specification.  Distribution of
          this memo is unlimited.

          This document is an Internet Draft.  Internet Drafts are
          working documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force
          (IETF), its Areas, and its Working Groups. Note that other
          groups may also distribute working documents as Internet
          Drafts.

          1.   Abstract

          This memo defines an experimental version of an ISO
          Transport Management Information Base for use with network
          management protocols.


          2.   Introduction

          This document defines an ISO Transport Management
          Information Base for use with the network management
          protocols.  The ISO Transport network management document
          [10] was used as a basis for this document.

          The ISO Transport network management document [10] is a
          draft document out for comment.  The comment period ended
          May 22, 1991.  Therefore, this INTERNET-DRAFT may change to
          accomodate any changes reflected in the final version of the
          ISO Transport network management document [10].


          3.   Objects

          The objects described in this document use the format
          described in "Concise MIB Definitions" [6].  This document
          should be referenced to fully understand section 4.

          Consistent with the IAB directive to produce simple,
          workable systems in the short-term, the list of managed
          objects defined here, has been derived by taking only those
          elements which are considered essential.  This document only
          describes ISO Transport class 4 specific objects.
