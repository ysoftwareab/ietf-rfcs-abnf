1.  Introduction

   As the industry becomes more sophisticated and network devices (e.g.,
   Internet of Things, Self-driving vehicles, and VoIP/VoLTE
   smartphones), service providers have a lot of problems mentioned in
   [RFC8192].  To resolve these problems, [i2nsf-nsf-cap-im] specifies
   the information model of the capabilities of Network Security
   Functions (NSFs).

   This document provides a data model using YANG [RFC6020][RFC7950]
   that defines the capabilities of NSFs to centrally manage
   capabilities of those security devices.  The security devices can
   register their own capabilities into Network Operator Management
   (Mgmt) System (i.e., Security Controller) with this YANG data model
   through the registration interface [RFC8329].  With the capabilities
   of those security devices registered centrally, those security
   devices can be easily managed [RFC8329].  This YANG data model is
   based on the information model for I2NSF NSF capabilities
   [i2nsf-nsf-cap-im].

Internet-Draft      I2NSF Capability YANG Data Model          March 2019


   This YANG data model uses an "Event-Condition-Action" (ECA) policy
   model that is used as the basis for the design of I2NSF Policy
   described in [RFC8329] and [i2nsf-nsf-cap-im].  Rules.  The "ietf-
   i2nsf-capability" YANG module defined in this document provides the
   following features:

   o  Definition for general capabilities of network security functions.

   o  Definition for event capabilities of generic network security
      function.

   o  Definition for condition capabilities of generic network security
      function.

   o  Definition for condition capabilities of advanced network security
      function.

   o  Definition for action capabilities of generic network security
      function.

   o  Definition for resolution strategy capabilities of generic network
      security function.

   o  Definition for default action capabilities of generic network
      security function.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119][RFC8174].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology described in
   [i2nsf-terminology][i2nsf-nsf-cap-im]
   [RFC8431][supa-policy-info-model].  Especially, the following terms
   are from [supa-policy-info-model]:

   o  Data Model: A data model is a representation of concepts of
      interest to an environment in a form that is dependent on data
      repository, data definition language, query language,
      implementation language, and protocol.

   o  Information Model: An information model is a representation of
      concepts of interest to an environment in a form that is
      independent of data repository, data definition language, query
      language, implementation language, and protocol.

3.1.  Tree Diagrams

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams
   [RFC8340] is as follows:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write) and "ro" state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node and "*"
      denotes a "list" and "leaf-list".

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

4.  Overview

   This section explains overview how the YANG data model can be used in
   I2NSF framework described in [RFC8329].  Figure 1 shows capabilities
   of NSFs in I2NSF Framework.  As shown in this figure, Developer's
   Mgmt System can register NSFs with capabilities that the network
   security device can support.  To register NSFs in this way, the
   Developer's Mgmt System utilizes this standardized capabilities YANG
   data model through registration interface.  With the capabilities of
   those network security devices registered centrally, those security
   devices can be easily managed, which can resolve the a lot of
   problems described in [RFC8192].  The following shows use cases.

   Note [i2nsf-nsf-yang] is used to configure security policy rules of
   generic network security functions and [i2nsf-advanced-nsf-dm] is
   used to configure security policy rules of advanced network security
   functions according to the capabilities of network security devices
   registed in I2NSF Framework.

   o  If network manager wants to apply security policy rules about
      blocking malicious users, it is a tremendous burden to apply all
      of these rules to NSFs one by one.  This problem can be resolved
      by managing the capabilities of NSFs.  If network manager wants to
      block malicious users with IPv6, network manager sends the
      security policy rules about blocking the users to Network Operator
      Mgmt System using I2NSF user (i.e., a web browser or a software).
      When the Network Operator Mgmt System receives the security policy
      rules, it automatically sends that security policy rules to
      appropriate NSFs (i.e., NSF-m in Developer Mgmt System A and NSF-1
      in Developer Mgmt System B) which can support the capabilities
      (i.e., IPv6).  Therefore, I2NSF User need not consider NSFs where
      to apply the rules.

   o  If NSFs find the malicious packets, it is a tremendous burden for
      network manager to apply the rule about blocking the malicious
      packets to NSFs one by one.  This problem can be resolved by

      managing the capabilities of NSFs.  If NSFs find the suspicious
      packets with IPv4, they can ask the Network Operator Mgmt System
      for information about the suspicious packets with IPv4.  to alter
      specific rules and/or configurations.  When the Network Operator
      Mgmt System receives information, it inspects the information
      about the suspicious packets with IPv4.  If the suspicious packets
      are determined to be malicious packets, the Network Operator Mgmt
      System creates and sends the security policy rule against
      malicious packets to appropriate NSFs (i.e., NSF-1 in Developer
      Mgmt System A and NSF-1 and NSF-n in Developer Mgmt System B)
      which can support the capabilities (i.e., IPv4).  Therefore, the
      new security policy rule against malicious packets can be applied
      to appropriate NSFs without intervention of humans.

                                 Functions

   This YANG tree diagram shows capabilities of network security
   functions.

   The NSF includes NSF capabilities.  The NSF capabilities include time
   capabilities, event capabilities, condition capabilities, action
   capabilities, resolution strategy capabilities, and default action
   capabilities.

   Time capabilities are used to specify capabilities when to execute
   the I2NSF policy rule.  The time capabilities are defined as absolute
   time and periodic time.

   Event capabilities are used to specify capabilities how to trigger
   the evaluation of the condition clause of the I2NSF Policy Rule.  The
   event capabilities are defined as system event and system alarm.  The
   event capability can be extended according to specific vendor
   condition features.  The event capability is described in detail in
   [i2nsf-nsf-cap-im].

Internet-Draft      I2NSF Capability YANG Data Model          March 2019


   Condition capabilities are used to specify capabilities of a set of
   attributes, features, and/or values that are to be compared with a
   set of known attributes, features, and/or values in order to
   determine whether or not the set of actions in that (imperative)
   I2NSF policy rule can be executed or not.  The condition capability
   is classified as condition capabilities of generic network security
   functions and advanced network security functions.  The condition
   capabilities of generic network security functions are defined as
   IPv4 capability, IPv6 capability, tcp capability, udp capability, and
   icmp capability.  The condition capabilities of advanced network
   security functions are defined as antivirus capability, antiddos
   capability, ips capability, http capability, and VoIP/VoLTE
   capability.  The condition capability can be extended according to
   specific vendor condition features.  The condition capability is
   described in detail in [i2nsf-nsf-cap-im].

   Action capabilities is used to specify capabilities how to control
   and monitor aspects of flow-based NSFs when the event and condition
   clauses are satisfied.  The action capabilities are defined as
   ingress action capability, egress action capability, and log action
   capability.  The action capability can be extended according to
   specific vendor action features.  The action capability is described
   in detail in [i2nsf-nsf-cap-im].

   Resolution strategy capabilities are used to specify capabilities how
   to resolve conflicts that occur between the actions of the same or
   different policy rules that are matched and contained in this
   particular NSF.  The resolution strategy capabilities are defined as
   First Matching Rule (FMR), Last Matching Rule (LMR), Prioritized
   Matching Rule (PMR) with Errors (PMRE), and Prioritized Matching Rule
   with No Errors (PMRN).  The resolution strategy capability can be
   extended according to specific vendor action features.  The
   resolution strategy capability is described in detail in
   [i2nsf-nsf-cap-im].

   Default action capabilities are used to specify capabilities how to
   execute I2NSF policy rule when no rule matches a packet.  The default
   action capabilities are defined as pass, drop, reject, alert, and
   mirror.  The default action capability can be extended according to
   specific vendor action features.  The default action capability is
   described in detail in [i2nsf-nsf-cap-im].

   This document requests IANA to register the following YANG module in
   the "YANG Module Names" registry [RFC7950].

      name: ietf-i2nsf-capability

      namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-i2nsf-capability

      prefix: iicapa

      reference: RFC XXXX

8.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a data schema
   designed to be accessed through network management protocols such as
   NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer is
   the secure transport layer, and the required transport secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the required transport secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides a means of
   restricting access to specific NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

Appendix A.  Changes from draft-ietf-i2nsf-capability-data-model-02

   The following changes are made from draft-ietf-i2nsf-capability-data-
   model-03:

   o  We revised this YANG data module according to guidelines for
      authors and reviewers of YANG data model documents [RFC6087].

   o  We changed the structure of the overall YANG data module.

   o  We changed enumeration type to identity type for scalable
      components.

   o  We added a description for the YANG tree diagram of the YANG data
      module.

   o  We revised overall sentences of this YANG data model document.

   o  We added configuration examples to make it easier for reviewers to
      understand.
