          Status Change for RFCs 4405, 4406, 4407 to Historic
                  draft-andersen-historic-4406-etal-00

Abstract

   In 2006, two experiments were started for email authentication:
   Sender Policy Framework (SPF, RFC 4408 [RFC4408]) and Sender ID (RFC
   4406 [RFC4406], supported by RFCs 4405 [RFC4405] and 4407 [RFC4407]).
   After eight years of experimental data (RFC 6686 [RFC6686]), it was
   clear that SPF remained in widespread use while Sender ID did not.
   RFC 7208 [RFC7208] moved SPF from Experimental status to Proposed
   Standard.  This document acknowledges that Sender ID did not pass its
   experiment, and changes the status of RFCs 4405 [RFC4405], 4406
   [RFC4406], and 4407 [RFC4407] to Historic.
