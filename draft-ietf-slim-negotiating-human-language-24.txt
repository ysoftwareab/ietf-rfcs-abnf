         Negotiating Human Language in Real-Time Communications
             draft-ietf-slim-negotiating-human-language-24

Abstract

   Users have various human (natural) language needs, abilities, and
   preferences regarding spoken, written, and signed languages.  This
   document adds new SDP media-level attributes so that when
   establishing interactive communication sessions ("calls"), it is
   possible to negotiate (communicate and match) the caller's language
   and media needs with the capabilities of the called party.  This is
   especially important with emergency calls, where a call can be
   handled by a call taker capable of communicating with the user, or a
   translator or relay operator can be bridged into the call during
   setup, but this applies to non-emergency calls as well (as an
   example, when calling a company call center).

   This document describes the need and a solution using new Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) media attributes.

1.  Introduction

   A mutually comprehensible language is helpful for human
   communication.  This document addresses the negotiation of human
   (natural) language and media modality (spoken, signed, written) in
   real-time communications.  A companion document [RFC8255] addresses
   language selection in email.

   Unless the caller and callee know each other or there is contextual
   or out-of- band information from which the language(s) and media
   modalities can be determined, there is a need for spoken, signed, or
   written languages to be negotiated based on the caller's needs and
   the callee's capabilities.  This need applies to both emergency and
   non-emergency calls.  For example, it is helpful for a caller to a
   company call center or a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) to be
   able to indicate preferred signed, written, and/or spoken languages,
   and for the callee to be able to indicate its capabilities in this
   area, allowing the call to proceed using the language(s) and media
   forms supported by both.

   For various reasons, including the ability to establish multiple
   streams using different media (e.g., voice, text, video), it makes
   sense to use a per-stream negotiation mechanism known as the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP).  Utilizing Session Description Protocol
   (SDP) [RFC4566] enables the solution described in this document to be
   applied to all interactive communications negotiated using SDP, in
   emergency as well as non-emergency scenarios.

   By treating language as another SDP attribute that is negotiated
   along with other aspects of a media stream, it becomes possible to
   accommodate a range of users' needs and called party facilities.  For
   example, some users may be able to speak several languages, but have
   a preference.  Some called parties may support some of those
   languages internally but require the use of a translation service for
   others, or may have a limited number of call takers able to use
   certain languages.  Another example would be a user who is able to
   speak but is deaf or hard-of-hearing and and desires a voice stream



Gellens                  Expires August 24, 2018                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft         Negotiating Human Language          February 2018


   to send spoken language plus a text stream to receive written
   language.  Making language a media attribute allows the standard
   session negotiation mechanism to handle this by providing the
   information and mechanism for the endpoints to make appropriate
   decisions.

   The term "negotiation" is used here rather than "indication" because
   human language (spoken/written/signed) can be negotiated in the same
   manner as media (audio/text/video) and codecs.  For example, if we
   think of a user calling an airline reservation center, the user may
   have a set of languages he or she speaks, with perhaps preferences
   for one or a few, while the airline reservation center will support a
   fixed set of languages.  Negotiation should select the user's most
   preferred language that is supported by the call center.  Both sides
   should be aware of which language was negotiated.

   In the offer/answer model used here, the offer contains a set of
   languages per media (and direction) that the offerer is capable of
   using, and the answer contains one language per media (and direction)
   that the answerer will support.  Supporting languages and/or
   modalities can require taking extra steps, such as having a call
   handled by an agent who speaks a requested language and/or with the
   ability to use a requested modality, or bridging external translation
   or relay resources into the call, etc.  The answer indicates the
   media and languages that the answerer is committing to support
   (possibly after additional steps have been taken).  This model also
   provides knowledge so both ends know what has been negotiated.  Note
   that additional steps required to support the indicated languages or
   modalities may or may not be in place in time for any early media.

   Since this is a protocol mechanism, the user equipment (UE client)
   needs to know the user's preferred languages; while this document
   does not address how clients determine this, reasonable techniques
   could include a configuration mechanism with a default of the
   language of the user interface; in some cases, a UE could tie
   language and media preferences, such as a preference for a video
   stream using a signed language and/or a text or audio stream using a
   written/spoken language.

   This document does not address user interface (UI) issues, such as if
   or how a UE client informs a user about the result of language and
   media negotiation.

1.1.  Applicability

   Within this document, it is assumed that the negotiating endpoints
   have already been determined, so that a per-stream negotiation based
   on the Session Description Protocol (SDP) can proceed.

   When setting up interactive communications sessions it is necessary
   to route signaling messages to the appropriate endpoint(s).  This
   document does not address the problem of language-based routing.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 RFC 8174 [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Desired Semantics

   The desired solution is a media attribute (preferably per direction)
   that may be used within an offer to indicate the preferred
   language(s) of each (direction of a) media stream, and within an
   answer to indicate the accepted language.  The semantics of including
   multiple languages for a media stream within an offer is that the
   languages are listed in order of preference.

   (Negotiating multiple simultaneous languages within a media stream is
   out of scope of this document.)

4.  The existing 'lang' attribute

   RFC 4566 [RFC4566] specifies an attribute 'lang' which appears
   similar to what is needed here, but is not sufficiently specific or
   flexible for the needs of this document.  In addition, 'lang' is not
   mentioned in [RFC3264] and there are no known implementations in SIP.
   Further, it is useful to be able to specify language per direction
   (sending and receiving).  This document therefore defines two new
   attributes.

5.  Solution

   An SDP attribute (per direction) seems the natural choice to
   negotiate human (natural) language of an interactive media stream,
   using the language tags of BCP 47 [RFC5646].

5.1.  The 'hlang-send' and 'hlang-recv' attributes

   This document defines two media-level attributes starting with
   'hlang' (short for "human language") to negotiate which human
   language is selected for use in each interactive media stream.  (Note
   that not all streams will necessarily be used.)  There are two
   attributes, one ending in "-send" and the other in "-recv",




Gellens                  Expires August 24, 2018                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft         Negotiating Human Language          February 2018


   registered in Section 6.  Each can appear in offers and answers for
   media streams.

   In an offer, the 'hlang-send' value is a list of one or more
   language(s) the offerer is willing to use when sending using the
   media, and the 'hlang-recv' value is a list of one or more
   language(s) the offerer is willing to use when receiving using the
   media.  The list of languages is in preference order (first is most
   preferred).  When a media is intended for interactive communication
   using a language in one direction only (e.g., a user with difficulty
   speaking but able to hear who indicates a desire to send using text
   and receive using audio), either hlang-send or hlang-recv MAY be
   omitted.  Note that the media can still be useful in both directions.
   When a media is not primarily intended for language (for example, a
   video or audio stream intended for background only) both SHOULD be
   omitted.  Otherwise, both SHOULD have the same value.  Note that
   specifying different languages for each direction (as opposed to the
   same or essentially the same language in different modalities) can
   make it difficult to complete the call (e.g., specifying a desire to
   send audio in Hungarian and receive audio in Portuguese).

   In an answer, 'hlang-send' is the language the answerer will send if
   using the media for language (which in most cases is one of the
   languages in the offer's 'hlang-recv'), and 'hlang-recv' is the
   language the answerer expects to receive if using the media for
   language (which in most cases is one of the languages in the offer's
   'hlang-send').

   In an offer, each value MUST be a list of one or more language tags
   per BCP 47 [RFC5646], separated by white space.  In an answer, each
   value MUST be one language tag per BCP 47.  BCP 47 describes
   mechanisms for matching language tags.  Note that [RFC5646]
   Section 4.1 advises to "tag content wisely" and not include
   unnecessary subtags.

   When placing an emergency call, and in any other case where the
   language cannot be inferred from context, in an offer each media
   stream primarily intended for human language communication SHOULD
   specify the 'hlang-send' and/or 'hlang-recv' attributes for the
   direction(s) intended for interactive communication.

   Clients acting on behalf of end users are expected to set one or both
   'hlang-send' and 'hlang-recv' attributes on each media stream
   primarily intended for human communication in an offer when placing
   an outgoing session, and either ignore or take into consideration the
   attributes when receiving incoming calls, based on local
   configuration and capabilities.  Systems acting on behalf of call

Internet-Draft         Negotiating Human Language          February 2018


   centers and PSAPs are expected to take into account the attributes
   when processing inbound calls.

   Note that media and language negotiation might result in more media
   streams being accepted than are needed by the users (e.g., if more
   preferred and less preferred combinations of media and language are
   all accepted).  This is not a problem.

5.2.  No Language in Common

   A consideration with the ability to negotiate language is if the call
   proceeds or fails if the callee does not support any of the languages
   requested by the caller.  This document does not mandate either
   behavior.

   When a call is rejected due to lack of any languages in common, the
   SIP response has SIP response code 488 (Not Acceptable Here) or 606
   (Not Acceptable) [RFC3261] and a Warning header field [RFC3261] with
   a warning code of [TBD: IANA VALUE, e.g., 308] and a warning text
   indicating that there are no mutually-supported languages; the
   warning text SHOULD also contain the supported languages and media.

   Example:



      Warning:  [TBD: IANA VALUE, e.g., 308] proxy.example.com
         "Incompatible language specification: Requested languages not
         supported.  Supported languages are: es, en; supported media
         are: audio, text."

5.3.  Usage Notes

   A sign-language tag with a video media stream is interpreted as an
   indication for sign language in the video stream.  A non-sign-
   language tag with a text media stream is interpreted as an indication
   for written language in the text stream.  A non-sign-language tag
   with an audio media stream is interpreted as an indication for spoken
   language in the audio stream.

   This document does not define any other use for language tags in
   video media (such as how to indicate visible captions in the video
   stream).

   In the IANA registry of language subtags per BCP 47 [RFC5646], a
   language subtag with a Type field "extlang" combined with a Prefix
   field value "sgn" indicates a sign-language tag.  The absence of such
   "sgn" prefix indicates a non-sign-language tag.

   This document does not define the use of sign-language tags in text
   or audio media.

   This document does not define the use of language tags in media other
   than interactive streams of audio, video, and text (such as "message"
   or "application").  Such use could be supported by future work or by
   application agreement.

5.4.  Examples

   Some examples are shown below.  For clarity, only the most directly
   relevant portions of the SDP block are shown.

   An offer or answer indicating spoken English both ways:

      m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 0
      a=hlang-send:en
      a=hlang-recv:en

   An offer indicating American Sign Language both ways:

      a=hlang-send:ase
      a=hlang-recv:ase

   An offer requesting spoken Spanish both ways (most preferred), spoken
   Basque both ways (second preference), or spoken English both ways

      m=audio 49250 RTP/AVP 20
      a=hlang-send:es
      a=hlang-recv:es

   An alternative answer to the above offer indicating spoken Italian
   both ways (as the callee does not support any of the requested
   languages but chose to proceed with the call):

      m=audio 49250 RTP/AVP 20
      a=hlang-send:it
      a=hlang-recv:it

   An offer or answer indicating written Greek both ways:

      m=text 45020 RTP/AVP 103 104
      a=hlang-send:gr
      a=hlang-recv:gr

   An offer requesting the following media streams: video for the caller
   to send using Argentine Sign Language, text for the caller to send
   using written Spanish (most preferred) or written Portuguese, audio
   for the caller to receive spoken Spanish (most preferred) or spoken
   Portuguese:

      m=video 51372 RTP/AVP 31 32
      a=hlang-send:aed

      m=audio 49250 RTP/AVP 20
      a=hlang-recv:sp pt

   An answer for the above offer, indicating text in which the callee
   will receive written Spanish, and audio in which the callee will send
   spoken Spanish.  The answering party had no video capability:

      m=video 0 RTP/AVP 31 32
      m=text 45020 RTP/AVP 103 104
      a=hlang-recv:sp

      m=audio 49250 RTP/AVP 20
      a=hlang-send:sp

   An offer requesting the following media streams: text for the caller
   to send using written English (most preferred) or written Spanish,
   audio for the caller to receive spoken English (most preferred) or
   spoken Spanish, supplemental video:

      m=text 45020 RTP/AVP 103 104
      a=hlang-send:en sp

      m=audio 49250 RTP/AVP 20
      a=hlang-recv:en sp

      m=video 51372 RTP/AVP 31 32

   An answer for the above offer, indicating text in which the callee
   will receive written Spanish, audio in which the callee will send
   spoken Spanish, and supplemental video:

      m=text 45020 RTP/AVP 103 104

      m=audio 49250 RTP/AVP 20
      a=hlang-send:sp

      m=video 51372 RTP/AVP 31 32

   Note that, even though the examples show the same (or essentially the
   same) language being used in both directions (even when the modality
   differs), there is no requirement that this be the case.  However, in
   practice, doing so is likely to increase the chances of successful
   matching.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  att-field Table in SDP Parameters

   The syntax in this section uses ABNF per RFC 5234 [RFC5234].

   IANA is kindly requested to add two entries to the 'att-field (media
   level only)' table of the SDP parameters registry:

   The first entry is for hlang-recv:

   Attribute Name:         hlang-recv
   Contact Name:           Randall Gellens
   Contact Email Address:  rg+ietf@coretechnologyconsulting.com
   Attribute Value:        hlang-value
   Attribute Syntax:

      hlang-value =  hlang-offv / hlang-ansv
                           ; hlang-offv used in offers
                           ; hlang-ansv used in answers
      hlang-offv  =  Language-Tag *( SP Language-Tag )

6.2.  Warn-Codes Sub-Registry of SIP Parameters

   IANA is requested to add a new value in the warn-codes sub-registry
   of SIP parameters in the 300 through 329 range that is allocated for
   indicating problems with keywords in the session description.  The
   reference is to this document.  The warn text is "Incompatible
   language specification: Requested languages not supported.  Supported
   languages and media are: [list of supported languages and media]."

7.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations of BCP 47 [RFC5646] apply here.  An
   attacker with the ability to modify signaling could prevent a call
   from succeeding by altering any of several crucial elements,
   including the 'hlang-send' or 'hlang-recv' values.  RFC 5069
   [RFC5069] discusses such threats.  Use of TLS or IPSec can protect
   against such threats.  Emergency calls are of particular concern; RFC
   6881 [RFC6881], which is specific to emergency calls, mandates use of
   TLS or IPSec (in ED-57/SP-30).

8.  Privacy Considerations

   Language and media information can suggest a user's nationality,
   background, abilities, disabilities, etc.

9.  Changes from Previous Versions

   RFC EDITOR: Please remove this section prior to publication.

Internet-Draft         Negotiating Human Language          February 2018


9.1.  Changes from draft-ietf-slim-...-04 to draft-ietf-slim-...-06

   o  Deleted Section 3 ("Expected Use")

   o  Reworded modalities in Introduction from "voice, video, text" to
      "spoken, signed, written"

   o  Reworded text about "increasingly fine-grained distinctions" to
      instead merely point to BCP 47 Section 4.1's advice to "tag
      content wisely" and not include unnecessary subtags

   o  Changed IANA registration of new SDP attributes to follow RFC 4566
      template with extra fields suggested in 4566-bis (expired draft)

   o  Deleted "(known as voice carry over)"

   o  Changed textual instanced of RFC 5646 to BCP 47, although actual
      reference remains RFC due to xml2rfc limitations

   o  Added Examples

   o  Added Privacy Considerations section

   o  Other editorial changes for clarity

9.3.  Changes from draft-ietf-slim-...-01 to draft-ietf-slim-...-02

   o  Deleted most of Section 4 and replaced with a very short summary

   o  Replaced "wishes to" with "is willing to" in Section 5.1

   o  Reworded description of attribute usage to clarify when to set
      both, only one, or neither

   o  Deleted all uses of "IMS"

   o  Other editorial changes for clarity

9.5.  Changes from draft-gellens-slim-...-03 to draft-ietf-slim-...-00

   o  Updated title to reflect WG adoption

9.6.  Changes from draft-gellens-slim-...-02 to draft-gellens-
      slim-...-03

   o  Removed Use Cases section, per face-to-face discussion at IETF 93

   o  Removed discussion of routing, per face-to-face discussion at IETF
      93

9.7.  Changes from draft-gellens-slim-...-01 to draft-gellens-
      slim-...-02

   o  Updated NENA usage mention

   o  Removed background text reference to draft-saintandre-sip-xmpp-
      chat-04 since that draft expired

9.8.  Changes from draft-gellens-slim-...-00 to draft-gellens-
      slim-...-01

   o  Revision to keep draft from expiring

9.9.  Changes from draft-gellens-mmusic-...-02 to draft-gellens-
      slim-...-00

   o  Changed name from -mmusic- to -slim- to reflect proposed WG name

   o  As a result of the face-to-face discussion in Toronto, the SDP vs
      SIP issue was resolved by going back to SDP, taking out the SIP
      hint, and converting what had been a set of alternate proposals
      for various ways of doing it within SIP into an informative annex
      section which includes background on why SDP is the proposal

   o  Added mention that enabling a mutually comprehensible language is
      a general problem of which this document addresses the real-time
      side, with reference to [RFC8255] which addresses the non-real-
      time side.

9.10.  Changes from draft-gellens-mmusic-...-01 to -02

   o  Added clarifying text on leaving attributes unset for media not
      primarily intended for human language communication (e.g.,
      background audio or video).

Internet-Draft         Negotiating Human Language          February 2018


   o  Added new section ("Alternative Proposal: Caller-prefs")
      discussing use of SIP-level Caller-prefs instead of SDP-level.

9.11.  Changes from draft-gellens-mmusic-...-00 to -01

   o  Relaxed language on setting -send and -receive to same values;
      added text on leaving on empty to indicate asymmetric usage.

   o  Added text that clients on behalf of end users are expected to set
      the attributes on outgoing calls and ignore on incoming calls
      while systems on behalf of call centers and PSAPs are expected to
      take the attributes into account when processing incoming calls.

9.12.  Changes from draft-gellens-...-02 to draft-gellens-mmusic-...-00

   o  Updated text to refer to RFC 5646 rather than the IANA language
      subtags registry directly.

   o  Moved discussion of existing 'lang' attribute out of "Proposed
      Solution" section and into own section now that it is not part of
      proposal.

   o  Updated text about existing 'lang' attribute.

   o  Added example use cases.

   o  Replaced proposed single 'hlang' attribute with 'hlang-send' and
      'hlang-recv' per Harald's request/information that it was a misuse
      of SDP to use the same attribute for sending and receiving.

   o  Added section describing usage being advisory vs required and text
      in attribute section.

   o  Added section on SIP "hint" header (not yet nailed down between
      new and existing header).

   o  Added text discussing usage in policy-based routing function or
      use of SIP header "hint" if unable to do so.

   o  Added SHOULD that the value of the parameters stick to the largest
      granularity of language tags.

   o  Added text to Introduction to be try and be more clear about
      purpose of document and problem being solved.

   o  Many wording improvements and clarifications throughout the
      document.

   o  Filled in Security Considerations.

   o  Filled in IANA Considerations.

   o  Added to Acknowledgments those who participated in the Orlando ad-
      hoc discussion as well as those who participated in email
      discussion and side one-on-one discussions.

9.13.  Changes from draft-gellens-...-01 to -02

   o  Updated text for (possible) new attribute "hlang" to reference RFC
      5646

   o  Added clarifying text for (possible) re-use of existing 'lang'
      attribute saying that the registration would be updated to reflect
      different semantics for multiple values for interactive versus
      non-interactive media.

   o  Added clarifying text for (possible) new attribute "hlang" to
      attempt to better describe the role of language tags in media in
      an offer and an answer.

9.14.  Changes from draft-gellens-...-00 to -01

   o  Changed name of (possible) new attribute from 'humlang" to "hlang"
   o  Added discussion of silly state (language not appropriate for
      media type)

   o  Added mention of multilingual people and multiple languages
   o  Minor text clarifications
