1.  Introduction

   The Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 Mobility Management [HMIPv6] did not
   specify nor favor any particular mechanism for establishing a
   Security Association (SA) between the Mobile Node (MN) and the
   Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) located within an HMIPv6 domain.

   This memo describes a method, which allows the MN to establish an SA
   with the selected MAP.  The suggested solution is based on using the
   Cryptographically Generated Address technology (described in [CGA]).

3.  Glossary

   Access Router

      The Access Router is the Mobile Node's default router.  The AR
      aggregates the outband traffic of mobile nodes.

   Mobility Anchor Point (MAP)

      A Mobility Anchor Point is a router located in a network visited
      by the mobile node, which is used by the MN as a local Home Agent
      (HA).

   Regional Care-of Address (RCoA)

      A Regional Care-of Address is an address obtained by the MN from
      the visited network.  An RCoA is an address on the MAP's subnet
      and is auto-configured by the MN when receiving the MAP option.

   On-link Care-of Address (LCoA)

      The LCoA is the on-link CoA configured on a mobile node's
      interface based on the prefix advertised by its default router.

   Local Binding Update (LBU) Message

      The MN sends a Local Binding Update message to the MAP in order to
      establish a binding between the RCoA and the LCoA.

   Pre-Binding Update (PBU) Message

      The MN's default router sends a Pre-Binding Update message to the
      MAP upon receiving a Router Solicitation (RtSol) message signed
      with CGA technology as described in the secure neighbor discovery
      protocol [SEND].

   Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA)

      A technique described in [CGA] whereby an IPv6 address of a node
      is cryptographically generated by using a one-way hash function
      from the node's public key (Kp) and some other parameters.

   Binding Acknowledgment (BA) Message

      The MAP sends a binding acknowledgment message to the MN in
      response to an LBU message.

4.  Proposed Solution

   We assume that the MN's LCoA is always computed based on the CGA
   technology, in order to allow the MN to run SEND protocol.  Such
   assumption has also been made in [FMIPkey], which aims to provide a
   security mechanism for [FMIPv6] protocol, and in the ongoing work on
   optimizing the SEND protocol (described in [OptiSEND]).

   In addition, we assume that the MN can discover the presence of an
   HMIPv6 domain before sending a RtSol message.  One example on how to
   discover the HMIPv6 domain may consist on using technologies
   described in [FRD].  However, it is important to mention that the
   proposed solution works with the same performance without such
   assumption.

   A third assumption is the existence of secure links between all
   routers located within the MAP tree.  Such assumption is justified by
   the fact that HMIPv6 protocol requires that routers within the MAP
   tree get involved in delivering the RtAdv message sent by the MAP(s)
   and in assisting the MN in selecting the most appropriate MAP.  The
   lack of secure links between nodes involved in offering the MAP
   service can make it vulnerable to denial of service (DoS) attacks.

   The suggested solution introduces a new signaling message, i.e., the
   Pre-Binding Update (PBU) message, which is sent by the AR to the MAP
   upon receiving a RtSol message from the MN carrying a valid signature
   (i.e., the message is signed with the MN's CGA private key).

   The following figure shows the signaling diagram for establishing a
   bidirectional SA between the MN and the MAP:

   1.  MN to AR:  Router Solicitation [CGA Signature] (RtSol)
   2a. AR to MN:  Router Acknowledgement [Ks] (RtAdv)
   2b. AR to MAP: Pre-Binding Update [Ks + LCoA] (PBU)
   3.  MN to MAP: Local Binding Update [DH value (X)] (LBU)
   4.  MAP to MN: Binding Acknowledgment [DH value (Y)] (BA)

   The suggested solution is described in the following steps:

   o  the MN configures a 64-bit interface identifier (IID) from using
      CGA technology then uses it to send a RtSol message signed with
      CGA, according to the SEND protocol.  Note that at this stage, the
      MN may not be aware that it has entered an HMIPv6 domain.

   o  Upon receiving a valid unicast RtSol message, the AR replies
      immediately by sending back a unicast RtAdv message to the MN and
      in parallel, a PBU message to the MAP.  For this purpose, the AR
      MUST compute a secret (Ks), encrypts it with the MN's CGA public



Haddad, et al.          Expires February 8, 2007                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                  HMIPv6sec                    August 2006


      key and sends it in the unicast RtAdv message.  The shared secret
      is inserted in a new option (Third Party Shared Key (TSPK)), which
      is carried by the unicast RtAdv message.
      The AR MUST also compute the LCoA and RCoA that the MN is supposed
      to autoconfigure.  For this purpose, the LCoA is computed by
      appending the 64-bit IID used in the RtSol message to the 64-bit
      prefix advertised by the AR and the RCoA is computed by appending
      the 64-bit prefix advertised by the MAP with the 64-bit IID
      computed in the following way:

      RCoA (IID) = First (64, SHA1(Ks | LCoA))

      Where First(x,y) is a function, which extracts the first x bits
      from y and LCoA is the MN's on link care-of address.

      After computing the MN's LCoA and RCoA, the AR inserts the two
      IPv6 addresses and Ks in the PBU message and sends it to the MAP.
      As noted earlier, it is assumed that the PBU messages are signed
      by the ARs and the paths between the ARs and the MAP are secure.

   o  After receiving the PBU message, the MAP creates a binding cache
      entry (BCE) for the MN, in which it stores the MN's LCoA, RCoA and
      Ks carried by the PBU message.  Once the BCE is created, the MAP
      waits for a limited amount of time for the owner of the two
      addresses to send the LBU message.  If no valid LBU message is
      received during the BCE preconfigured lifetime then the MAP SHOULD
      delete it.

   o  When the MN gets a valid RtAdv message, it discovers that it has
      entered an HMIPv6 domain.  The following is based on the
      assumption that the MN decides to use the MAP as its local Home
      Agent, which means that the MN has to configure an RCoA then
      request the MAP to create a BCE.  For this purpose, the MN SHOULD
      use the same method as the AR (described earlier) to autoconfigure
      its RCoA and LCoA.  After that, the MN initiates a Diffie-Hellman
      (DH) procedure with the MAP by sending its DH public value (X) in
      a new option (Session Mobility Secret (SMS)), which is carried by
      the first LBU message sent to the MAP in order to request the MAP
      to bind its LCoA to its new RCoA.  The MN MUST protect the
      integrity of the LBU message by including a keyed hash of the
      message using Ks.  The keyed hash is syntactically and
      semantically similar to the Binding Authorization Data option
      specified in [MIPv6].

   o  Upon receiving an LBU message, the MAP searches its BCEs table for
      an LCoA, which matches the one sent in the LBU message.  If the
      same LCoA is found, then the MAP computes the RCoA IID in the same
      way as described above, and compares it to the one claimed by the

      MN in the LBU message then it checks the authenticity of the
      message.
      If the LBU message is valid, then the MAP completes the DH
      exchange by sending its own DH public value (Y) in a new option
      (MAP Session Mobility Secret (MSMS)), which is carried by the BA
      message sent to the MN.  The MAP MUST protect the integrity of the
      BA message by including a keyed hash of the message using Ks.  The
      keyed hash is syntactically and semantically similar to the
      Binding Authorization Data option specified in [MIPv6].

      By sending (Y) to the MN, both nodes will be able to compute the
      session mobility key (Ksm) (i.e., from values (X) and (Y)).
      Note that if the RCoA address sent in the LBU message is not the
      same as the one stored in the corresponding BCE then the MAP MUST
      simply discard the LBU message.

   o  After sending the first BA message, the MAP SHOULD keep Ks and (Y)
      in the MN's corresponding BCE until a new value of the binding
      update sequence number is stored.  This is needed in case the MN
      goes out of reach for a short period of time and misses the first
      BA message (i.e., (Y)), in which case it has to re-send the LBU
      message.

   o  When the MN gets a BA message carrying a DH value, i.e., an SMS
      option, it starts by checking its authenticity with Ks.  If the
      message is valid then the MN computes Ksm and establishes a
      bidirectional SA with the MAP.

   o  By completing the DH procedure, both nodes will be able to compute
      the session mobility key (Ksm) (i.e., from values (X) and (Y)) and
      use it to authenticate subsequent LBU/BA messages exchanged
      between them.

   Note that the SA lifetime is set to 24 hours, after which the MN has
   to request the MAP to renew it.

5.  New Messages and Options Format

   In the following, we describe the PBU message structure and the
   format of the four new options.

5.1.  The Pre-Binding Update (PBU) Message Format

   When the AR receives a valid RtSol message signed with CGA, it sends
   a PBU message to the MAP, which carries the MN's LCoA, RCoA and Ks.

   The format of the PBU message is as follows:


      0                   1                   2                   3

   Option Length
   Length of the option.

   Option Data
   The Option Data field contains the DH public value (Y) sent by the
   MAP to the MN in the BA message.

5.4.  The Session Mobility Secret (SMS) Option

   The SMS option is carried by the first LBU message sent by the MN to
   the MAP after receiving an unicast RtAdv message carrying a TPSK
   option.  The SMS option contains the DH public value (X) sent by the
   MN to the MAP to initiate a DH exchange, which will allow both nodes
   to compute a shared secret (Ksm).
   Note that the first LBU message sent by the MN to the MAP MUST be
   authenticated with Ks.

   The SMS option has the following format:


      0                   1                   2                   3

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document introduces 3 new types of options and one new type of
   message.  The values of these types are 8-bit unsigned integers.
   These values are allocated according to the Standards Actions or IESG
   approval policies defined in [IANA].

7.  Security Considerations

   This proposal suggests using the CGA technology to secure the
   exchange between the MN and the AR as described in the SEND protocol,
   to derive a first shared secret between the two entities and to use
   it later to authenticate Diffie-Hellman messages exchanged between
   the MN and the MAP.  This is recommended due to the fact that public
   key signature is a computationally expensive and lengthy procedure.

   The suggested proposal does not create nor enhance any new and/or
   existing threats.  In particular, launching a man-in-the middle
   attack against the MN is not possible because the attacker is not
   aware of the shared secret Ks.

   The proposal provides integrity protection by including a keyed hash
   of the message.  The proposal provides replay protection by using the
   sequence number in the binding updates.  The proposal does not
   require the MAP to have prior knowledge of the MN's identity.

   The suggested proposal DOES NOT guard against compromise of the
   access router.  If the access router is compromised it can act as a
   man-in-the-middle for the MN-MAP exchange.  But a compromised router
   can do far worse things like null routing all the packets emanating
   from the mobile node, or modify router advertisements to conceal the
   presence of a HMIPv6 domain.  We consider the AR compromise problem
   to be orthogonal to the issues addressed in this draft.

8.  Change Log

   This document introduces the following changes from previous
   versions:

   - Remove the reliance on the crypto-based identifier (CBID) in order
   to further simplify the protocol.

   - Remove any new option from the RtSol message and adopt the same
   format as used in SEND.

   - Reduce the size of the PBU message by eliminating the need to send
   the MN's CGA public key.

   - Change the document title to reflect the new modifications.

   - Correct few typos.
