                   Network Monitoring Protocol (NMP)
                 draft-gu-network-mornitoring-protol-00

Abstract

   To enable automated network OAM (Operations, administration and
   management), the availability of network protocol running status
   information is a fundamental step.  In this document, a network
   monitoring protocol (NMP) is proposed to provision the information
   related to running status of IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol) and
   other control protocols.  It can facilitate the network
   troubleshooting of control protocols in a network domain.  Typical
   network issues are illustrated as the usecases of NMP for ISIS to
   showcase the necessity of NMP.  Then the operations and the message
   formats of NMP for ISIS are defined.  In this document ISIS is used
   as the illustration protocol, and the case of OSPF and other control
   protocols will be included in the future version.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation

   The requirement for better network OAM approaches has been greatly
   driven by the network evolvement.  Network OAM provides visibility to
   the network health conditions, and is beneficial for faster network

   troubleshooting and self-healing, network OpEx (operating
   expenditure) reduction, and network optimization.  Network OAM
   statistics show that a relatively large part of the network issues
   are caused by the disfunction of various routing protocols and MPLS
   signalings.

   The general troubleshooting logic nowadays is to log in a faulty
   router, physically or through Telnet, and by using CLI to display
   related information/logs for fault source localization and further
   analysis.  There are several concerns with the conventional
   troubleshooting:

   1.  It requires rich OAM experience for the OAM operator to know what
   information to check on the device, and the operation is complex;

   2.  In a multi-vendor network, it requires the understanding and
   familiarity of vendor specific operations and configurations;

   3.  Locating the fault source device could be non-trivial work, and
   is often realized through network-wide device-by-device check, which
   is both time-consuming and labor-consuming; and finally,

   4.  The acquisition of troubleshooting data can be difficult under
   some cases, e.g., when auto recovery is used.

   Alternatively, the idea of collecting information from devices and
   exporting to the centralized controller/server for further analysis
   is also used to gain more insight on the management plane information
   for OAM purposes.  For example, SNMP (Simple Network Management
   Protocol) [RFC1157], NETCONF (Network Configuration Protocol)
   [RFC6241], gNMI/gRPC [I-D.openconfig-rtgwg-gnmi-spec], etc. are used
   for the purpose.  However, the approaches are mainly used for data
   SET/GET of the management plane which are insufficient for the
   troubleshooting of control plane issues.

   BGP monitoring protocol (BMP) [RFC7854] has been proposed to monitor
   BGP routes and peer status which provides the control plane
   information and thus more insight for troubleshooting.  This document
   extends BMP to collect information of other control protocols for
   monitoring to facilitate the trouble shooting of control plane issues
   which call as Network Monitoring Protocols (NMP).

1.2.  Overview

   Like BMP, an NMP session is established between each monitored router
   (NMP client) and the NMP monitoring station (NMP server) through TCP
   connection.  Information are collected directly from each monitored

   router and reported to the NMP server.  The NMP message can be both
   periodic and event-triggered, depending on the message type.

   ISIS [RFC1195], as one of the most commonly adopted network layer
   protocols, builds the fundamental network connectivity of an
   autonomous system (AS).  The disfunction of ISIS, e.g., ISIS neighbor
   down, route flapping, MTU mismatch, and so on, could lead to network-
   wide instability and service interruption.  Thus, it is critical to
   keep track of the health condition of ISIS, and the availability of
   information, related to ISIS running status, is the fundamental
   requirement.  In this document, typical network issues are
   illustrated as the use cases of NMP for ISIS to showcase the
   necessity of NMP.  Then the operations and the message formats of NMP
   for ISIS are defined.  In this document ISIS is used as the
   illustration protocol, and the case of OSPF and other control
   protocols will be included in the future version.

2.  Terminology

   IGP: Interior Gateway Protocol

   NMP: Network Monitoring Protocol

   IMP: Network Monitoring Protocol for IGP

3.  Use Cases

   We have identified several typical network issues due to ISIS
   disfunction that are currently difficult to detect or localize.  The
   usage of NMP is not limited to the solve the following listed issues.

3.1.  ISIS Adjacency Issues

   ISIS adjacency issues are identified as top network issues and may
   take hours to localize.  The adjacency issues can be classified into
   two situations:

   1.  An existing established adjacency goes down;

   2.  An adjacency fails to be established.

   In Case 1, the adjacency down can be caused by factors such as
   circuit down, hold timer expiration, device memory low, user
   configuration change, and so on.  Case 2 can be caused by mismatch
   link MTU, mismatch authentication, mismatch area ID, system ID
   conflict, and so on.  Typically, such adjacency failure events are
   logged/recorded in the device, but currently there is no real-time
   report/alarm of such issue.  The conventional troubleshooting process

Internet-Draft         Network Monitoring Protocol             July 2018


   for adjacency issue is to find the faulty devices and then log in to
   check the logs or the Hello statistics for further analysis.

   Using NMP, the ISIS adjacency status: up, down and initial, is
   reported to the NMP server in real time, together with the possible
   recorded reasons.  Then the NMP server can solve such issue in about
   minutes.  For example, for an adjacency set up failure due to
   different authentications, the NMP server can recognize the
   difference by comparing the Hello PDUs collected from both devices.

3.2.  Forwarding Path Disconnection

   Mismatched MTU values for devices along a certain path can lead to
   packet forwarding failure while the control plane is working
   properly.  The failure may not be detected by Ping, but the
   forwarding plane appears disconnected for certain size of data
   packets.  It can be quite common since vendors have different
   understanding and configuration of MTU.  There are methods proposed
   to discover the path MTU.  For example, router's link MTU is conveyed
   in the MPLS LDP/RSVP-TE path set up signaling, and the path MTU is
   decided at the ingress or egress node[RFC3988] [RFC3209].  For IPv4
   packets, by setting the DF flag bit of the outgoing packet, any
   device along the path with smaller MTU will drop the packet, and send
   back an ICMP Fragmentation Needed message containing its MTU,
   allowing the source to reduce the MTU.  The process is repeated until
   the MTU is small enough to traverse the entire path without
   fragmentation[RFC1191].  Apparently, such method is too time-
   consuming.

   Using NMP, each device can report its link MTU to the monitoring
   station directly.  The mismatch can be recognized at the NMP server
   in seconds.

3.3.  ISIS LSP Synchronization Failure

   It happens that two ISIS neighbors fail to learn the LSPs sent from
   each other in the following two cases: in Case 1, the LSP fails to be
   received, and in Case 2, the LSP is received but the LSP information
   shown in the receiver's LSDB is not the same as the one sent from the
   transmitter (e.g., one or more prefixes missing, the LSP sequence
   number modified).  Case 1 can be caused by link failure, similar to
   the adjacency down issue.  In Case 2, the received LSP can be
   processed incorrectly due to hardware/software bugs.  In fact, the
   LSDB synchronization issue is usually hard to localize once happens.

   Using NMP, the NMP server can detect the failure by comparing the
   sent/received LSP statistics from the two neighbors.  In the case
   that the received LSPs are improperly processed within the device,

   the NMP monitoring station can recognize the LSP synchronization
   failure by comparing the LSPs sent out from the two neighbors.

4.  Extensions of NMP for ISIS

4.1.  Message Types

   The variety of ISIS troubleshooting use cases requires a systematic
   information report of NMP, so that the NMP server or any third party
   analyzer could efficiently utilize the reported messages to localize
   and recover various network issues.  We define NMP messages for ISIS
   uses the following types:

   o  Initiation Message: A message used for the monitored device to
      inform the NMP monitoring station of its capabilities, vendor,
      software version and so on.  For example, the link MTU can be
      included within the message.  The initiation message is sent once
      the TCP connection between the monitoring station and monitored
      router is set up.  During the monitoring session, any change of
      the initiation message could trigger an Initiation Message update.

   o  Peer Status Change Notification Message: A message used to inform
      the monitoring station of the adjacency status change of the
      monitored device, i.e., from up to down, from down/initiation to
      up, with possible alarms/logs recorded in the device.  This
      message notifies the NMP server of the ongoing ISIS adjacency
      change event and possible reasons.  If no reason is provided or
      the provided reason is not specific enough, the NMP server can
      further analyze the ISIS PDU or the ISIS statistics.

   o  Statistic Report Message: A message used to report the statistics
      of the ongoing ISIS process at the monitored device.  For example,
      abnormal LSP count of the monitored device can be a sign of route
      flapping.  This message can be sent periodically or event
      triggered.  If sent periodically, the frequency can be configured
      by the operator depending on the monitoring requirement.  If it's
      event triggered, it could be triggered by a counter/timer
      exceeding the threshold.

   o  ISIS PDU Monitoring Message: A message used to update the NMP
      server of any PDU sent from and received at the monitored device.
      For example, the Hello PDUs collected from two neighbors can be
      used for analyzing the adjacency set up failure issue.  The LSPs
      collected from two neighbors can be analyzed for the LSP
      synchronization issue.

   o  Termination Message: A message for the monitored router to inform
      the monitoring station of why it is closing the NMP session.  This
      message is sent when the monitoring session is to be closed.

4.2.  Message Format

4.2.1.  Common Header

   The common header is encapsulated in all NMP messages.  It includes
   the Version, Message Length and Message Type fields.

   o  Version (1 byte): Indicates the NMP version and is set to '1' for
      all messages.

   o  Message Length (4 bytes): Length of the message in bytes
      (including headers, data, and encapsulated messages, if any).

   o  Peer Flag (2 bytes): The Circuit Type (2 bits) flag specifies if
      the router is an L1(01), L2(10), or L1/L2(11).  If both bits are
      zeroes (00), the Per Peer Header is ignored.  This configuration
      is used when the statistic is not per-peer based, e.g., when
      reporting the number of adjacencies.

   o  Neighbor System ID (6 bytes): identifies the system ID of the
      remote router.

   o  Neighbor Area ID (2 bytes): identifies the area ID of the remote
      router.

   o  Timestamp (4 bytes): records the time when the message is sent/
      received, expressed in seconds and microseconds since midnight
      (zero hour), January 1, 1970 (UTC).

4.2.3.  Initiation Message

   The Initiation Message indicates the monitored router's capabilities,
   vendor, software version and so on.  It consists of the Common Header
   and the Router Capability TLV.  The Common Header can be followed by
   multiple Router Capability TLVs.

   The Router Capability TLV is defined as follows.

    0                   1                   2                   3

   o  Router Capability Type: provides the type of the router capability
      information.  Currently defined types are:

      *  Type = 0: sysDescr.  The corresponding Router Capability Value
         field should contain an ASCII string whose value MUST be set to
         be equal to the value of the sysDescr MIB-II [RFC1213] object.

      *  Type = 1: sysName.  The corresponding Router Capability Value
         field should contain an ASCII string whose value MUST be set to
         be equal to the value of the sysName MIB-II [RFC1213] object.

      *  Type = 2: Local System ID.  The corresponding Router Capability
         Value field should indicate the router's System ID

      *  Type = 3: Link MTU.  The corresponding Router Capability Value
         field should indicate the router's link MTU.

      *  Type = 4: String.  The corresponding Router Capability Value
         field contains a free-form UTF-8 string whose length is given
         by the Information Length field.

4.2.4.  Peer Status Change Notification

   The Peer Status Change Notification Message indicates an ISIS
   adjacency status change: from up to down or from initiation/down to
   up.  It consists of the Common Header, Per Peer Header and the Reason
   TLV.  The Notification is triggered whenever the status changes.  The
   Reason TLV is optional, and is defined as follows.  More Reason types
   can be defined if necessary.

    0                   1                   2                   3

   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

   o  Reason Flags (1 byte): The S flag (1 bit) indicates if the Peer
      status is from up to down (set to 0) or from down/initial to up
      (set to 1).  The rest bits of the Flag field are reserved.  When
      the S flag is set to 1, the Reason Type should be set to all
      zeroes (i.e., Type 0), the Reason Length fields should be set to
      all zeroes, and the Reason Value field should be set empty.

   o  Reason Type (1 byte): indicates the possible reason that caused
      the peer status change.  Currently defined types are:

      *  Type = 0: Adjacency Up.  This type indicates the establishment
         of an adjacency.  For this reason type, the S flag MUST be set
         to 1, indicating it's a peer-up event.  There's no further
         reason to be provided.  The reason Length field should be set
         to all zeroes, and the Reason Value field should be set empty.

      *  Type = 1: Circuit Down.  For this data type, the S flag MUST be
         set to 0, indicating it's a peer-down event.  The length field
         is set to all zeroes, and the value field is set empty.

      *  Type = 2: Memory Low. For this data type, the S flag MUST be
         set to 0, indicating it's a peer-down event.  The length field
         is set to all zeroes, and the value field is set empty.

      *  Type = 3: Hold timer expired.  For this data type, the S flag
         MUST be set to 0, indicating it's a peer-down event.  The
         length field is set to all zeroes, and the value field is set
         empty.

      *  Type = 4: String.  For this data type, the S flag MUST be set
         to 0, indicating it's a peer-down event.  The corresponding
         Reason Value field indicates the reason specified by the
         monitored router in a free-form UTF-8 string whose length is
         given by the Reason Length field.

   o  Reason Length (2 bytes): indicates the length of the Reason Value
      field.

   o  Reason Value (variable): includes the possible reason why the
      Adjacency is down.

4.2.5.  Statistic Report Message

   The Statistic Report Message reports the statistics of the parameters
   that are of interest to the operator.  The message consists of the
   NMP Common Header, the Per Adjacency Header and the Statistic TLV.
   The message include both per-peer based statistics and non per-peer
   based statistics.  For example, the received/sent LSP counts are per-
   peer based statistics, and the local LSP change times count and the
   number of established adjacencies are non per-peer based statistics.
   For the non per-peer based statistics, the CT Flag (2 bits) in the
   Per Peer Header MUST be set to 00.  Upon receiving any message with
   CT flag set to 00, the Per Peer Header should be ignored (the total
   length of the Per Peer Header is 18 bytes as defined in
   Section 3.2.2, and the message reading/analysis should resume from
   the Statistic TLV part.

   The Statistic TLV is defined as follows.

   o  Statistic Flags (1 byte): provides information for the reported
      statistics.

      *  T flag (1 bit): indicates if the statistic is for the received-
         from direction (set to 1) or sent-to direction the neighbor
         (set to 0)

   o  Statistic Type (1 byte): specifies the statistic type of the
      counter.  Currently defined types are:

      *  Type = 0: Hello PDU count.  The T flag indicates if it's a sent
         or received Hello PDU.  It is a per-peer based statistic type,
         and the CT flag in the Per Peer Header MUST NOT be set to 00.

      *  Type = 1: Incorrect Hello PDU received count.  For this type,
         the T flag MUST be set to 1.  It is a per-peer based statistic
         type, and the CT flag in the Per Peer Header MUST NOT be set to
         00.

      *  Type = 2: LSP count.  The T flag indicates if it's a sent or
         received LSP.  It is a per-peer based statistic type, and the
         CT flag in the Per Peer Header MUST NOT be set to 00.

      *  Type = 3: Incorrect LSP received count.  For this type, the T
         flag MUST be set to 1.  It is a per-peer based statistic type,
         and the CT flag in the Per Peer Header MUST NOT be set to 00.

      *  Type = 4: Retransmitted LSP count.  For this type, the T flag
         MUST be set to 0.  It is a per-peer based statistic type, and
         the CT flag in the Per Peer Header MUST NOT be set to 00.

      *  Type = 5: CSNP count.  The T flag indicates if it's a sent or
         received CSNP.  It is a per-peer based statistic type, and the
         CT flag in the Per Peer Header MUST NOT be set to 00.

      *  Type = 6: PSNP count.  The T flag indicates if it's a sent or
         received PSNP.  It is a per-peer based statistic type, and the
         CT flag in the Per Peer Header MUST NOT be set to 00.

      *  Type = 7: Number of established adjacencies.  It's a non per-
         peer based statistic type, and thus for the monitoring station
         to recognize this type, the CT flag in the Per Peer Header MUST
         be set to 00.

      *  Type = 8: LSP change time count.  It's a non per-peer based
         statistic type, and thus for the monitoring station to
         recognize this type, the CT flag in the Per Peer Header MUST be
         set to 00.

   o  Statistic Length (2 bytes): indicates the length of the Statistic
      Value field.

   o  Statistic Value (4 bytes): specifies the counter value, which is a
      non-negative integer.

4.2.6.  ISIS PDU Monitoring Message

   The ISIS PDU Monitoring Message is used to update the monitoring
   station of any PDU sent from and received at the monitored device per
   neighbor.  Following the Common Header and the Per Peer Header is the
   ISIS PDU.  To tell whether it's a sent or received PDU, the
   monitoring station can analyze the source and destination addresses
   in the reported PDUs.

4.2.7.  Termination Message

   The Termination Message is sent when the NMP session is to be closed,
   and is used to indicate the termination reason to the monitoring
   station.  The TCP session between the monitored router and the
   monitoring station should be terminated upon receiving this message.
   It consists of the Common Header and the Termination Info TLVs,
   defined as follows.

    0                   1                   2                   3

   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

   o  Termination Info Type (2 bytes): Provides the termination reason
      type.  Currently defined types are:

      *  Type = 0: Unknown.  This reason type specifies that the NMP
         session is closed for an unknown or unspecified reason.  For

         this data type, the length field is filled with all zeroes, and
         the value field is set empty.

      *  Type = 1: Memory Low. This reason indicates that the monitored
         router lacks resources for the NMP session.  For this data
         type, the length field is filled with all zeroes, and the value
         field is set empty.

      *  Type = 2: Administratively Closed.  This reason specifies that
         the session is closed due to administrative reasons.  The
         corresponding Termination Info Value field may include more
         details about the reason expressed in a free-form UTF-8 string
         whose length is given by the Termination Info Length field.

      *  Type = 3: String.  The corresponding Termination Info Value
         field may include details about the reason expressed in a free-
         form UTF-8 string whose length is given by the Termination Info
         Length field.

      Termination Info Length (2 bytes): indicates the length of the
      Termination Info Reason Value field.

   o  Termination Info Value (variable): includes more detailed reason
      for the session termination.
