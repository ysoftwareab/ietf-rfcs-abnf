Abstract

     This document specifies an extension to the multicast addressing
     architecture of the IPv6 protocol. The extension allows for the use
     of Interface Identifiers (IIDs) to allocate multicast addresses.
     When a link-local unicast address is configured at each interface
     of a node, an IID is uniquely determined.  After that, each node
     can generate their unique multicast addresses automatically without
     conflicts.  Basically, this document proposes an alternative method
     for creating link-local multicast addresses over a known method
     like unicast-prefix-based IPv6 multicast addresses. It is preferred
     to use this method for link-local scope rather than unicast-
     prefix-based IPv6 multicast addresses.  This memo update RFC3306.

1. Introduction

     This document defines an extension to the multicast portion of the
     IPv6 addressing architecture [RFC 3513]. The current architecture
     does not contain any built-in support for dynamic address
     allocation.  The extension allows for use of IIDs to allocate
     multicast addresses.  When a link-local unicast address is
     configured at each interface of a node, an IID is uniquely
     determined.  After that, each node can generate their unique
     multicast addresses automatically without conflicts.  That is,
     these addresses could safely be configured at any time after DAD
     (Duplicate Address Detection) has completed.

     Basically, it is preferred to use this method for the link-local
     scope rather than unicast-prefix-based IPv6 multicast addresses
     [RFC 3306].  This document restricts the usage of defined fields
     such as scop, plen and network prefix fields of [RFC 3306].
     Therefore, this document specifies encoded information for link-
     local scope in multicast addresses.

     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
     "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "June", and "OPTIONAL" in
     this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].



2. Applicability

     The allocation technique in this document is designed to be used in
     any environment in which link-local scope IPv6 multicast addresses
     are assigned or selected.  Especially, this method goes well with
     nodes supplying multicast services in a zeroconf/serverless
     environment.  For example, multicast addresses less than or equal
     to link-local scope are themselves generated by nodes supplying
     multicast services without conflicts.  Also, hosts which are
     supplied multicast services from multicast servers then make
     multicast addresses of multicast servers using ND (address
     resolution) and well-known group IDs.

     Consequently, this technique MUST only be used for link scoped
     multicast addresses.  If you want to use multicast addresses
     greater than link-local scope, you need to use other methods as
     described in [RFC 3306].



3. Link Scoped Multicast Address Format

     This document specifies a new format that incorporates IID
     information in the multicast addresses.  The idea of delegating
     multicast addresses can be applicable to link-local scope.

     Figure 1 illustrates the new format for link scoped multicast
     addresses.

      |   8    |  4 |  4 |   8    |    8   |       64       |    32    |
      +--------+----+----+--------+--------+----------------+----------+
      |11111111|flgs|scop|reserved|  LSM   |       IID      | group ID |
      +--------+----+----+--------+--------+----------------+----------+

           Figure 1: Link scoped multicast IPv6 address format

     flgs MUST be "0011".  (The first two bits set to zero by the
     sending node and ignored on receipt).  "flgs" MUST use the same
     flag defined in section 4 of [RFC 3306].

     scop MUST be <= 2.  It is preferred to use this method for the
     link-local scope rather than unicast-prefix-based IPv6 multicast
     addresses [RFC 3306].  But, the users can choose whichever they
     wish and deem appropriate.

     The reserved field MUST be zero.

     LSM field MUST be "1111 1111" which maps to the plen field in [RFC
     3306], whereas the plen field in [RFC 3306] MUST NOT be greater
     than 64.

     That is, flgs, scop, and plen fields are used to identify whether
     an address is a multicast address as specified in this document.

     The IID field is used to distinguish each node from others.  And
     this value is obtained from the IEEE EUI-64 based interface
     identifier of the link-local unicast IPv6 address.  Given the use
     of this method for link-local scope, the IID embedded in the
     multicast address MUST only come from the IID of the link-local
     unicast address on the interface after DAD has completed.  That is,
     the creation of the multicast address MUST only occur after DAD has
     completed as part of the auto-configuration process.

     Group ID is generated to indicate a multicast application and is
     used to guarantee its uniqueness only in the host.  It June also be

     set on the basis of the guidelines outlined in [RFC 3307].



4. Example

     This is an example of link scoped IPv6 multicast addresses.  For
     example in an ethernet environment, if the link-local unicast
     address is FE80::A12:34FF:FE56:7890, the link scoped multicast
     prefix of the node is FF32:00FF:A12:34FF:FE56:7890::/96.



5. Consideration of Lifetime

     Generally, Link scoped multicast addresses have no lifetime because
     link-local unicast addresses also have no lifetime.  But, it is not
     true in environment of mobile.  Even though multicast addresses are
     created from the unique IID of unicast address, their useful
     lifetime is linked to the period during which the IID is known to
     be unique.  Thus, it is possible to conflict between IIDs, due to a
     new node in merged network that uses the same IID and a powered
     node.  The document does not consider this case at this phase.  It
     is another challenging issue and out of scope of this document.



6. Security Considerations

     The uniqueness of multicast addresses using this method is
     guaranteed by the DAD process.  So, it is needed to get a secure
     DAD process for stability of this method.  This document proposes
     the mechanism in [RFC 3041] for this purpose.

     [RFC 3041] describes the privacy extension to IPv6 stateless
     address autoconfiguration for an IID and how to configure the
     global-scope unicast addresses.  The privacy extension method in
     [RFC 3041] is triggered when a host receives a router advertisement
     with a prefix information option carrying a global-scope prefix for
     the purpose of address auto-configuration.  That is, [RFC 3041] can
     not be used for making a link-local unicast address.  Since the IID
     embedded in the link scoped multicast address MUST only come from
     the IID of the link-local unicast address on the interface after
     DAD has completed, the secure IID, generated by [RFC 3041], can not
     be used for consisting of a link scoped multicast address.  But, it
     is possible to use secure IID for expanding the intensity of
     security regardless of a difficulty of acquisition of multicast
     server addresses.
