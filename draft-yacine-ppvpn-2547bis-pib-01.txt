Abstract 
   
   This document describes a Policy Information Base (PIB) for a device
   implementing the BGP/MPLS VPN [2547bis] Architecture. The 
   Provisioning Classes defined here provide policy control of resources 
   implementing the BGP/MPLS VPN Architecture. These Provisioning 
   Classes can be used with other non BGP/MPLS VPN Provisioning Classes 
   (defined in other PIBs) to provide for a comprehensive policy 
   controlled mapping of service requirements to device resource 
   capability and usage.
   
   The COPS-PR protocol offers significant advantages when dealing with 
   dynamic configuration and when compared to traditional management 
   solutions. Moreover, dynamic VPN resource assignment is crucial to 
   cope with the frequent changes requests from customer's (e.g., sites 
   joining or leaving a VPN), as well as to achieve scalability. The PEs 
   should be able to dynamically assign the VPN resources. This 
   capability is especially important for dial and wireless VPN    
   services.

2. Introduction 
   
   [SPPI] describes a structure for specifying policy information that 
   can then be transmitted to a network device for the purpose of 
   configuring policy at that device. The model underlying this 
   structure is one of well-defined provisioning classes and instances 
   of these classes residing in a virtual information store called the 
   Policy Information Base (PIB). 
   
   This document specifies a set of provisioning classes specifically 
   for configuring BGP/MPLS VPN services in the service provider devices 
   (PE routers). 
   
   One way to provision policy is by means of the COPS protocol [COPS] 
   with the extensions for provisioning [COPS-PR]. This protocol 
   supports multiple clients, each of which may provision policy for a 
   specific policy domain such as VPNs. The PRCs defined in this 
   BGP/MPLS VPN PIB are intended for use by the COPS-PR PPVPN client-
   type [COPS-PPVPN]. Furthermore, these PRCs are in addition to any 
   other PIBs that may be defined for the PPVPN client type in the 
   future, as well as the PRCs defined in the Framework PIB [FR-PIB] and 
   the Feedback Framework PIB [FEED-PIB]. 
   
   The COPS-PR protocol offers significant advantages when dealing with 
   dynamic configuration and when compared to traditional management 
   solutions. Moreover, dynamic VPN resource assignment is crucial to 
   cope with the frequent changes requests from customer's (e.g., sites 
   joining or leaving a VPN), as well as to achieve scalability. The PEs 
   should be able to dynamically assign the VPN resources. This 
   capability is especially important for dial and wireless VPN
   services. 
   

3. Relationship to the MPLS VPN MIB
   
   The present version of the BGP/MPLS VPN PIB has been designed to be 
   the closest as possible to the MPLS VPN MIB [MPLS-VPN-MIB] for 
   
El Mghazli                                                      [Page 3]



Internet Draft     draft-yacine-ppvpn-2547bis-pib-01.txt      April 2002
   
   
   consistency purposes.
   
   However, in order to take advantage of the specifics of SPPI and 
   COPS-PR in general, the BGP/MPLS VPN PIB has its own structure and 
   data organization.
   
   
4. Assumptions and Prerequisites
   
   It is assumed that certain things are configured and operational in
   order for the tables and objects described in this PIB to work
   correctly. These things are outlined below:
   
   
   Customer Visible Routing:
   
   Routing protocols running on the customer interface (between PE 
   routers and CE devices) must be configurable per VRF. To this end, 
   the service provider may use any of the management solutions such as 
   SNMP with the routing protocols MIBs.
   
   
   Routing across the SP backbone:
   
   The MP-iBGP mechanisms specific to BGP/MPLS VPNs is assumed 
   to be configured and operational in order for PEs to exchange
   their routes. To this end, the service provider may use any of the 
   management solutions such as SNMP with the BGP4 specific MIB, namely 
   [BGP4-MIB].
   
   Then the BGP/MPLS mechanisms are in charge of dynamically ditribute 
   these routes between sites according to the VPN policies contained in 
   the present PIB.
   
   
   VPN Tunneling and QoS:
   
   MPLS in general, must be configured and operational. To this end, the 
   service provider may use any of the management solutions such as SNMP
   with the MPLS specific MIBs, namely [LSR-MIB], [FTN-MIB] or [TE-MIB].
   
   The LSPs establishment between PEs within the service provider 
   network is out of the scope of this document. It is the service 
   provider's responsibility to establish internal LSPs in order to 
   connect its PEs or RRs together. The LSPs can be either best-effort 
   or QoS-aware, traffic engineered or not, etc.
   
   This requires coordination of identifiers of tunnels, hierarchical 
   tunnels, VPNs, and any associated service information, for example, a 
   QoS service. This is an implementation concern.
   
   
   Underlying infrasructure:
   
El Mghazli                                                      [Page 4]



Internet Draft     draft-yacine-ppvpn-2547bis-pib-01.txt      April 2002
   
   
   
   The configuration of a PE-based PPVPN must be coordinated with the 
   configuration of the underlying infrastructure, including Layer 1 and 
   2 networks interconnecting components of a PPVPN. This is out of the 
   scope of this document.
   
   
5. Operational Overview
   
5.1 Features List

   BGP/MPLS VPN management supports configuration of intranet and 
   extranet membership. COPS-PR enables VPN service creation, 
   configuration, monitoring and deletion. It supports the 'VPN join' 
   and 'VPN prune' operations dynamically.
   
   BGP/MPLS VPN configuration using COPS-PR enables dynamical 
   provisioning of resources associated with VPN services. For 
   example, the number and size of VRF instances is provisionable.
   
   The PIB supports BGP/MPLS VPN service as Enterprise VPN, 
   Carrier's Carrier VPN, or Inter/Multi-provider Backbone VPN.
   
   The PIB supports the maintenance and troubleshooting of BGP/MPLS
   VPNs.
   
   The PIB supports BGP/MPLS VPNs that are configured on a 
   particular physical interface or sub-interface if the interface can 
   be divided (e.g. Frame Relay, ATM, or Ethernet VLAN) by the router. 
   
   The PIB must be supported by PE routers and shall be used to 
   configure and maintain one or more VPN Routing and Forwarding Tables 
   (VRFs).
   
   The BGP/MPLS VPN PIB enables to monitor some specific parameters for 
   accounting purposes.

5.2 Roles usage with the 2547bis PIB
   
   According to [FR-PIB], roles provide a way to bind policy to 
   interfaces without having to explicitly identify interfaces in a 
   consistent manner across all network devices. That is, roles provide 
   a level of indirection to the application of a set of policies to 
   specific interfaces. This separates the policy definition from device 
   implementation specific interface identification. Furthermore, if 
   the same policy is being applied to several interfaces, that policy 
   need be pushed to the device only once, rather than once per 
   interface, as long as the interfaces are configured with the same 
   role combination. 
   
   When using the BGP/MPLS VPN PIB, the manager SHOULD set the roles 
   according to interfaces VPN membership. The role combination of a 
   customer interface must correspond to the VPNs it belongs to.
   
El Mghazli                                                      [Page 5]



Internet Draft     draft-yacine-ppvpn-2547bis-pib-01.txt      April 2002
   
   
   Hence, the PEP interprets this information and connect interfaces to
   VRFs accordingly. But such an interpretation is an implementation 
   concern, hence it is out of the scope of the present document.


6. PIB overview
   
   This PIB is structured based on the need to configure the VRFs 
   realizing a VPN among the different PE routers, and the 
   parameterization of these VRFs. 
   
   In addition, the PIB includes tables describing the capabilities and 
   limitations of the device using a general extensible framework [FR-
   PIB]. These tables are reported to the PDP and assist the PDP with 
   the configuration of VRFs that can be instantiated by the device. 
   
   Finally, this PIB offers also feedback tables in order for the PEP to 
   monitor, record and report specific information. These tables are 
   reported periodically to the PDP based on selection criteria set by 
   the PDP itself. This feedback mechanism follows the feedback 
   extensible framework [FEED-FRWK].
   
   The 3 groups are summarized bellow in this section. 
   
   
6.1 Capabilities Group
   
   This group consists of PRCs to indicate to the PDP the types of 
   interface supported on the PEP in terms of their BGP/MPLS VPN 
   capabilities (MPLS support, interface type with respect to the 
   BGP/MPLS VPN mechanisms) and PRCs to indicate the device routing 
   capabilities. This group describes capabilities in terms of the types 
   of interfaces and general routing capabilities of the device.
   The framework PIB [FR-PIB] provides a general extensible framework 
   for defining the capabilities and limitations of the elements listed 
   above. The capability tables allow intelligent configuration of the 
   elements by a PDP. 
   
   
   Routing Capabilities:
   
   This table represents routing capabilities of the device (PE) in 
   terms of protocol support, maximum number of routes and maximum 
   number of VRFs in the PE. The configuration of VRFs in the PE must be 
   according to these values.
   
   
   Interfaces Capabilities:
   
   This table represents PE interfaces capabilities essentially in terms 
   of MPLS support. An interface can either support MPLS, MPLS TE 
   tunnels or even not support MPLS at all. In this latter case, such an 
   interface cannot be used for BGP/MPLS VPN purposes.

6.2 Policy Group
   
   This group contains configuration of the functional elements that 
   comprise the BGP/MPLS VPN route distribution policy that applies to a 
   device. This group contains VRFs and Route Targets, BGP peers, 
   interfaces and routing table for each VRF instance. This group takes 
   configuration in terms of interface types and role combinations 
   [FR-PIB]; it does not deal with individual interfaces on the device. 
   
   
   VRF Table:
   
   This table specifies BGP/MPLS VPN VRF Table associated information. 
   Entries in this table define VRF routing instances associated with 
   BGP/MPLS VPN interfaces or sub-interfaces. A specific Route 
   Distinguisher is affected to each VRF in each PE. The whole pool of 
   RDs is managed by the PDP.
   
   
   Route Target Table:
   
   This table contains the objects necessary to configure and monitor 
   route targets for a particular VRF. According to BGP/MPLS VPN 
   framework [2547bis], the configuration of import and export route 
   targets realize topological route distribution policies and, as a 
   consequence, the so-called VPNs.
   
   
   Interface Table:
   
   This table contains configuration information related 
   to customer interfaces participating in BGP/MPLS VPNs. This table 
   takes configuration in terms of interface index, referencing the 
   Role Combination rows [FR-PIB].
   

   BGP Peer Table:
   
   This class contains the BGP peers of the device for a particular VRF. 
   Based on the information contained in this table, the PE 
   implementation can build ORFs. In case the PE routers uses BGP to 
   exchange ORF capabilities [BGP-ORF], this table should be ignored and 
   each PE router is a potential BGP peer.
   
   
   Routing Table:
   
   The role of the VRF routes table is mainly to allow the network 
   manager to monitor the content of the VRF specific routing table and 
   also to configure static routes within the backbone.

Internet Draft     draft-yacine-ppvpn-2547bis-pib-01.txt      April 2002
   
   
   
6.3 FeedBack Group
   
   According to the framework of COPS-PR policy usage feedback
   [FEED-FRWK], there are three basic types of policy used to define
   what the PEP is to monitor, record and report. These are the 
   selection criteria policy, the usage policy and the feedback report 
   linkage policy. 
   
   The selection criteria policy is installed by the PDP. It defines the 
   conditions used by the PEP to monitor and record a usage policy. The 
   selection criteria policy may only be used for defining usage 
   feedback selection criteria. 
   
   The usage policy defines what attributes are monitored and recorded 
   by the PEP. The usage policies specify counts related to a specific 
   action such as routes being added in a VRF. The PDP decides which 
   PRC(s) best suit(s) its requirements. The PEP may support multiple 
   usage feedback PRCs. The PDP then decides which PRC to associate with 
   a particular selection criterion. 
   
   A usage feedback policy and selection policy are tightly associated 
   with one another. A third policy, the frwkFeedbackLinkTable, is 
   used to associate, or provide a linkage for the selection and usage 
   policies. The frwkFeedbackLinkTable [FEED-PIB] also specifies when 
   to report the usage feedback. The frwkFeedbackLinkTable entry permits 
   the same selection criteria instance to be re-used for various usage 
   feedback policies. The frwkFeedbackLinkTable contains the value of 
   the selection criteria instance as well as contains the value of 
   the usage feedback PRC.
   
   The PDP is not aware of the instance identifier of the usage feedback 
   policy when installing the selection criteria and feedback linkage 
   policies. The usage feedback policy is instantiated on the PEP by the 
   installation of a feedback report linkage and the PEP designates the 
   instance identifier. The usage feedback policy class always contains 
   an attribute of type ReferenceId that contains the instance value of 
   the associated frwkFeedbackLinkTable instance installed by the PDP. 
   

   Route & Label Count Usage Tables:

   These tables contain respectively counters of routes hold by a 
   VRF, and counters of labels illegally received by a VRF.
   
   
   Threshold Table:
   
   This table contains the thresholds which triggers a report of the 
   counters of either routes or labels.
   
   
   Selection Table:
   
El Mghazli                                                      [Page 8]



Internet Draft     draft-yacine-ppvpn-2547bis-pib-01.txt      April 2002
   
   
   
   This class identifies a VRF to collect usage information from.
   
   
7. PIB Usage Example
   
   Bellow is an example of a fulfilled BGP/MPLS VPN PIB. The
   example given in this section aims at realizing the following 
   configuration in a PE router:


                    +------------------+
                    |         +----+   |ospf
                    | +---+   |VRF1|---+----IF1 (intranet VPN1)
                    | | B |---|    |---+----IF2 (intranet VPN1)
                    | | G |   +----+   |eBGP
   (Backbone)IF4----+-+ P |   +----+   |
                    | | 4 |---|VRF2|---+----IF3 (intranet VPN1 &
                    | +---+   |    |   |eBGP     extranet VPN2)
                    |         +----+   |
                    +------------------+
   
             Figure 1. PE router example configuration
   
   
   
-- Local settings:
   
   The following tables are BGP/MPLS VPN specific. They give an example 
   of the routing and interface capabilities for a particular device 
   (PE). These information are sent to the PDP mainly at the beginning 
   of the session.
   
   ppvpn2547RoutingCapsTable
   {
      Prid=1, DistProtocol=eBGP+OSPF, MaxRoutes=500.000, MaxVrfs=500,
        ORFMgt = False;
   }
   
   ppvpn2547IfCapsTable
   {
      Prid=1, TunnelSupport=mplsTunnel, Type=network;
      Prid=2, TunnelSupport=mpls      , Type=customer;
      Prid=3, TunnelSupport=none      , Type=customer;
   }


-- Framework PIB:
   
   The following tables are defined in the generic framework PIB [FR-
   PIB]. The PRIs are set by the PDP and sent to the PEP for consistent 
   later configuration.
   
   
El Mghazli                                                      [Page 9]



Internet Draft     draft-yacine-ppvpn-2547bis-pib-01.txt      April 2002
   
   
   The framework Capability Set table defines the different 
   interface types in terms of the BGP/MPLS VPN capabilities.
   
   frwkIfCapSetTable
   {
      Prid=1, Name="Customer", Capability=ppvpn2547IfCaps.2;
      Prid=2, Name="Customer", Capability=ppvpn2547IfCaps.3;
      Prid=3, Name="Network",  Capability=ppvpn2547IfCaps.1;
   }
   
   The framework Role Combination table informs on which interface type 
   each interface belongs to and also affect roles to each interface. 
   The role affected to each interface SHOULD correspond to the VPN
   membership, as shown in the example bellow:
   
   frwkIfRoleComboTable
   {
      Prid=1, Roles=VPN1,      CapSetName="Customer", IfIndex=1;
      Prid=2, Roles=VPN1,      CapSetName="Customer", IfIndex=2;
      Prid=3, Roles=VPN1+VPN2, CapSetName="Customer", IfIndex=3;
      Prid=4, Roles=SP,        CapSetName="Network",  IfIndex=4;
   }
   
   Do note that two interfaces, corresponding to 2 distinct sites 
   belong to the same VPN.
   
   
-- BGP/MPLS VPN PIB:
   
   The following tables are also BGP/MPLS VPN specific and realize 
   routes distribution policies between sites. For further details about 
   each PRCs, read the BGP/MPLS VPN PIB definition in the next section.
   
   ppvpn2547VrfTable{
      Prid=1, Roles=VPN1,      IfName="Customer", VrfId=0,
        Descr="Intranet", RD=XX, MaxRoutes=1000;
      Prid=2, Roles=VPN1+VPN2, IfName="Customer", VrfId=1,
        Descr="Extranet", RD=YY, MaxRoutes=2000;
   }
   
   Do note that the roles enable to link an interface or a set of 
   interfaces, according to the VPN membership information.
   
   ppvpn2547RouteTargetTable{
      Prid=1, Type=both  , VrfId=0, RT="VPN1",

10. Subject Category Considerations 
   
   The numbering space used for the BGP/MPLS VPN PIB, as indicated by 
   the SUBJECT-CATEGORIES clause, will be assigned by the Internet 
   Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). Notice the numbering space used by 
   SUBJECT-CATEGORIES maps to the Client Type numbering space in [COPS-
   PR]. This relationship is detailed in section 7.1 of [SPPI]. Due 
   to the fact that Client Type value of 1 has already been used by 
   [COPS-RSVP], the numbering space for SUBJECT-CATEGORIES will need to 
   start with the value of 2. 
   
   Other PIB Modules may use the same SUBJECT-CATEGORIES as this 
   BGP/MPLS VPN PIB Module. In such situations, PRC numbering space 
   under a specific SUBJECT-CATEGORIES should be coordinated with 
   existing PIB Modules using the same SUBJECT-CATEGORIES. 
   
   
11. Security Considerations 
   
   The information contained in a PIB when transported by the COPS 
   protocol [COPS-PR] may be sensitive, and its function of 
   provisioning a PEP requires that only authorized communication take 
   place.  The use of IPSEC between PDP and PEP, as described in 
   [COPS], provides the necessary protection against these threats.

   The IETF is being notified of intellectual property rights claimed 
   in regard to some or all of the specification contained in this 
   document. For more information consult the online list of claimed 
   rights. 
   
   
13. IANA Considerations 
   
   This document standardizes a Policy Information Base (PIB) module, 
   requesting an IANA assigned PIB number.
