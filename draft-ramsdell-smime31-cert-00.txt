Status of this memo

This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with all
provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026.

Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.  Note that other
groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-Drafts.

Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

1. Overview

In light of the expiration of the primary RSA patent, it is proposed
that the RSA algorithm replace the DSS and Diffie-Hellman as the MUST
implement algorithms in the S/MIME profile. This draft will describe
only the proposed changes to the S/MIME Version 3 Certificate Handling
RFC [SMIMEV3CERT], and the rest of that RFC will remain identical.


1.1 Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in [MUSTSHOULD].


1.2 Discussion of This Draft

This draft is being discussed on the "ietf-smime" mailing list.
To subscribe, send a message to:
     ietf-smime-request@imc.org
with the single word
     subscribe
in the body of the message. There is a Web site for the mailing list
at <http://www.imc.org/ietf-smime/>.


2. Changes to the S/MIME Version 3 Certificate Handling RFC

The following changes to are proposed to [SMIMEV3CERT]:

1. Section 4.3 is replaced with the following:

     4.3 Certificate and CRL Signing Algorithms
     
     Certificates and Certificate-Revocation Lists (CRLs) are
     signed by the certificate issuer. A receiving agent MUST be
     capable of verifying the signatures on certificates and CRLs
     made with md2WithRSAEncryption, md5WithRSAEncryption and sha-
     1WithRSAEncryption signature algorithms with key sizes from
     512 bits to 2048 bits described in [PKCS#1V2].
     
     A receiving agent MAY be capable of verifying the signatures
     on certificates and CRLs made with id-dsa-with-sha1 [DSS].


3. Security Considerations

The security considerations are the same as for [SMIMEV3CERT].
