Abstract

   This Document proposes two extension schemes of PMIPv6, called
   Query-based PMIPv6 (QPMIPv6) and Signaling Query-based PMIPv6 (S-
   QPMIPv6), which send the binding query messages to LMA to get the
   care-of-address of a mobile node and to deliver the subsequent data
   packet over optimized data path. The proposed two schemes have some
   differences with each other. We will show that the performances of
   the schemes comparing PMIPv6 with QPMIPv6 and S-QPMIPv6.

1. Introduction

   In wireless networks environment, the Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) was
   designed from Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to support the
   network-based mobility for the mobile node (MN) in IPv6 network. The
   network-based mobility means that the MN does not participate in
   exchanging signals to process the mobility management unlike host-
   based mobility which means that MN should have modules to exchange
   the signals related to mobility management.

   In the PMIPv6, the mobile agents called Mobile Access Gateway (MAG)
   and Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) in the network will perform the
   mobility signaling instead of MN, and will keep track of movement of
   MN. When the MN moves in new MAG's area and the MAG detects the MN's
   attachment. To update the LMA about of current location of the MN,
   the MAG sends Proxy Binding Update (PBU) message to LMA. Upon
   accepting this PBU message, the LMA sends a Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement (PBA) message to MN and creates the Binding Cache
   Entry (BCE). After these registration procedures, LMA sets up its
   endpoint of the bi-directional tunnel to MAG, the MN is ready to
   communicate with Correspond Node (CN) by sending or receiving data
   packets.

   When the MN communicates with CN in PMIPv6, the data packets should
   be delivered from source to destination via Local Mobility Anchor
   (LMA), so it means that data packets can be delivered over the non-
   optimized path inefficiently.

   This document proposes two exclusive packet delivery schemes of
   PMIPv6, called Query-based PMIPv6 (Q-PMIPv6) and Signaling Query-
   based PMIPv6 (SQ-PMIPv6), in which the CN side MAG will send the
   binding query to LMA to get the Proxy-CoA of MN. After getting the
   Proxy-CoA of MN, the MAG will deliver all the subsequent data
   packets over the optimized packet delivery path.

3. Protocol Detail

3.1. Network Consideration

   To describe the proposed scheme, we will extend the PMIPv6, which
   can deliver data packets over the more optimized path than basic
   PMIPv6 data delivery path. So it can reduce the packet delivery cost
   and overheads of LMA. Figure 1 shows the reference network model for
   Q-PMIP and SQ-PMIP.

              Figure 1 Network model for QPMIPv4 and S-QPMIPv4

   In the figure 1, CN tries to transmit data packets to MN. On
   reception of the first data packet destined to MN, the C-MAG
   exchanges the PBQ and PBA messages with LMA to get Proxy-CoA of MN.
   And then the bi-directional tunnel is established between MAGs. In
   PMIPv6, MN will perform the registration with LMA. All the data
   packets transmitted by CN will be forwarded to LMA and delivered by
   LMA to MN using the tunneling. In QPMIPv6, the data packets are
   delivered over the tunnel between MAG's. This path optimization
   reduces the overhead of LMA and packet delivery cost between the MN
   and the CN.

   The M-MAG sends the PBU operation with the LMA to register the
   binding and routing state of MN. On receiving the PBU request, the
   LMA will create the BCE and send the PBA to respond to the M-MAG.

   CN sends the data packets to MN. When C-MAG receives the first
   packet from CN, and then the C-MAG sends PBQ message to the LMA to
   request the Proxy-CoA of MN. After receiving the PBQ message from C-
   MAG, the LMA sends PBA including the information that includes
   Proxy-CoA of MN. During these procedures, the C-MAG has been
   received the data packets from CN. To prevent the packet losses, the
   MAG performs the buffering until that C-MAG receives PBA from LMA
   and sets up the bi-directional tunnel between the M-MAG and the C-

   MAG.

   After establish the tunnel, the C-MAG sends the data packets
   buffered in the C-MAG first. After that, the C-MAG sends the data
   packets received from CN.  Basically, the MAG in PMIPv6 network
   delivers all data packets to LMA. But the Q-PMIP can use the
   optimized path without LMA to transmit the data packet by using the
   Query. With the data transport over the optimized path, QPMIPv6 can
   reduce the transmission delays of data packets, compared to PMIPv6.
   In addition, QPMIPv6 can avoid the problem of the excessive data
   traffic load at LMA, since the data transmission to MN will be
   performed by the concerned MAG, instead of LMA, in the distributed
   manner.

3.3. Signaling Query-based PMIPv6

   SQ-PMIPv6 is based on Q-PMIPv6 which is introduced above section.
   The Q-PMIPv6 has a problem, so there are some differences. If
   buffered data packets in MAG2 increase while processing the PBQ-PBA
   operation with LMA. For example, PBQ or PBA message delivery time
   increase. That case, the amount of data packets which should be
   saved in buffer at MAG2 is also increased.

                  Figure 3 Signaling Q-PMIPv6 Operations

   To solve this problem in Q-PMIPv6, we suggest the additional
   signaling procedure to prepare data transmission between CN and the
   MAG2. Before the CN sends data packets, CN must send the Data
   Transmission-Request (DT-Req) message to the MAG2. After receiving
   the DT-Req message, the MAG2 performs the PBQ operation like Q-
   PMIPv6 and sends Data Transmission-Acknowledgement (DT-Ack) message
   to respond to the CN. By these procedures, SQ-PMIP does not need to
   buffer the data packets, so it can reduce the overhead in MAG2.

   TBD

6. Conclusions

   This document proposes two exclusive packet delivery schemes of
   PMIPv6, called Query-based PMIPv6 (Q-PMIPv6) and Signaling Query-
   based PMIPv6 (SQ-PMIPv6). Both of two schemes are proposed to reduce
   the overhead in LMA and the transmission delays of data packets from
   CN to MN. But, the QPMIPv6 should perform the buffering of data
   packets, before the Query-Ack procedure is done. If the procedure
   time may take longer, the data packet transmission will be delayed.
   It can be solved using proposed scheme SQ-PMIPv6 which is an
   enhanced scheme of the Q-PMIP.
