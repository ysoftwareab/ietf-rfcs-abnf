Abstract

   The eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is a framework for structuring
   data.  While it evolved from SGML -- a markup language primarily
   focused on structuring documents -- XML has evolved to be a widely-
   used mechanism for representing structured data.

   There are a wide variety of Internet protocols; many have need for a
   representation for structured data relevant to their application.
   There has been much interest in the use of XML as a representation

Internet-Draft            XML in IETF Protocols               April 2002


1. Introduction and Overview

   The eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is a framework for structuring
   data.  While it evolved from the Standard Generalized Markup Language
   (SGML) [18] -- a markup language primarily focused on structuring
   documents -- XML has evolved to be a widely-used mechanism for
   representing structured data  in protocol exchanges.  See [34] for an
   introduction to XML.

1.1 Intended Audience

   Many Internet protocol designers are considering using XML and XML
   fragments within the context of existing and new Internet protocols.
   This document is intended as a guide to XML usage and as IETF policy
   for standards track documents.  Experienced XML practitioners will
   likely already be familiar with the background material here, but the
   guidelines are intended to be appropriate for those readers as well.

1.2 Scope

   This document is intended to give guidelines for the use of XML
   content within a larger protocol.

   There are a number of protocol frameworks already in use or under
   development which focus entirely on "XML protocol": the exclusive use
   of XML as the data representation in the protocol.  For example, the
   World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is developing an XML Protocol
   framework [31] based on the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)
   [35].  The applicability of those protocols is not part of the scope
   of this document.

   In addition, there are higher-level representation frameworks, based
   on XML, that have been designed as carriers of certain classes of
   information; for example, the Resource Description Framework (RDF)
   [30] is an XML-based representation for logical assertions.  This
   document does not provide guidelines for the use of such frameworks.

1.3 XML Evolution

   Originally published in February 1998 [29], XML's popularity has led
   to several additions to the base specification.  Although these
   additions are designed to be consistent with version 1.0 of XML, they
   have varying levels of stability, consensus, and implementation.
   Accordingly, this document identifies the major evolutionary features
   of XML and makes suggestions as to the circumstances in which each
   feature should be used.

1.4 XML Users, Support Groups, and Additional Information

   There are many XML support groups, some devoted to the entire XML
   industry (e.g., http://xml.org/), some devoted to developers (http://
   xmlhack.com/), some devoted to the business applications of XML
   (e.g., http://oasis-open.org/), and many, many groups devoted to the
   use of XML in a particular context.

   It is beyond the scope of this document to provide a comprehensive
   list of referrals.  Interested readers are directed to the three
   links above as starting points, as well as their favorite Internet
   search engine.

2. XML Selection Considerations

   XML is a tool that provides a means towards an end.  Choosing the
   right tool for a given task is an essential part of ensuring that the
   task can be completed in a satisfactory manner.  This section
   describes factors to be aware of when considering XML as a tool for
   use in IETF protocols:

   o  XML is a meta-markup language that can be used to define markup
      languages for specific domains and problem spaces.

   o  XML provides both logical structure and physical structure to
      describe data.  Data framing is built-in.

   o  XML includes features to support internationalization and
      localization.

   o  XML is extensible.  New tags (and thus new protocol elements) can
      be defined without requiring changes to XML itself.

   o  XML is still evolving.  The formal specifications are still being
      influenced and updated as use experience is gained and applied.

   o  XML is text-based, so XML fragments are easily created, edited,
      and managed using common utilities.  Further, being text-based
      means it more readily supports incremental development, debugging,
      and logging.

   o  XML is verbose when compared with many other data encapsulation
      languages.  A representation with element extensibility and human
      readability typically requires more bits when compared to one
      optimized for efficient machine processing.

   o  XML implementations are still relatively new.  As designers and
      implementers gain experience, it is not uncommon to find defects
      in early and current products.

   o  XML support is available in a large number of software development
      utilities, available in both open source and proprietary products.

   o  XML processing speed can be an issue in some environments.  XML
      processing can be slower because XML data streams may be larger
      than other representations, and the use of general purpose XML
      parsers will add a software layer with its own performance costs.

3. XML Alternatives

   This document focuses on guidelines for the use of XML, but it's
   useful to consider why one would use XML as opposed to some other
   mechanism.  This section considers some other commonly used
   representation mechanisms and compares XML to those alternatives.

   For example, Abstract Syntax Notation 1 (ASN.1) [16] along with the
   corresponding Basic Encoding Rules (BER) [17] are part of the OSI
   communication protocol suite, and have been used in many subsequent
   communications standards (e.g., the ANSI Information Retrieval
   protocol [15] and the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
   [21]).  The eXternal Data Representation (XDR) [22] and variations of
   it have been used in many other distributed network applications
   (e.g., the Network File System protocol [28]).  With ASN.1, data
   types are explicit in the representation, while with XDR, the data
   types of components are described externally as part of an interface
   specification.

   Many other protocols use data structures directly (without data
   encapsulation) by describing the data structure with Backus Normal
   Form (BNF) [13]; many IETF protocols use an Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) [24].  The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol [27] is an
   example of a protocol specified using ABNF.

   Representation methods differ from XML in several important ways:

   Specification encoding: XML schema are themselves represented in XML,
   and the specification itself can be written using arbitrary
   characters from the language.  The specification of representations
   in other systems (ASN.1, XDR, ABNF) are generally in ASCII [14] text.

   Text Encoding and character sets: the character encoding used to
   represent a formal specification.  XML defines a consistent character
   model based on ISO 10646 [19], with a base that supports at least
   UTF-8 [4] and UTF-16 [26], and allows for other encodings.  While
   ASN.1 and XDR may carry strings in any encoding, there is no common
   mechanism for defining character encodings within them.  Typically,
   ABNF definitions tend to be defined in terms of octets or characters
   in ASCII.

   Data Encoding: XML is based on a character model.  XML Schema [11]
   includes mechanisms for representing some datatypes (integer, date,
   array, etc.) but other binary datatypes are encoded in Base64 [23].
   ASN.1 and XDR have rich mechanisms for encoding a wide variety of
   datatypes.

   Extensibility: XML has a rich extensibility model: XML



Hollenbeck, et al.       Expires October 4, 2002                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft            XML in IETF Protocols               April 2002


   representations can frequently be versioned independently.  Many XML
   representations can be extended by adding tokens to the XML namespace
   (if done compatibly); other extensions can be added by adding to the
   namespace.  ASN.1 is similarly extensible through the use of Object
   Identifiers (OIDs).  XDR representations tend to not be independently
   extensible by different parties because the framing and datatypes are
   implicit and not self-describing.  The extensibility of BNF-based
   protocol elements needs to be explicitly planned.

   Legibility of protocol elements: As noted above, XML is text-based,
   and thus carries the advantages (and disadvantages) of text-based
   protocol elements.  Typically this is shared with (A)BNF-defined
   protocol elements.  ASN.1 and XDR use binary encodings which are not
   visible.

   ASN.1, XDR, and BNF are described here as examples of alternatives to
   XML for use in IETF protocols.  There are other alternatives, but a
   complete enumeration of all possible alternatives is beyond the scope
   of this document.

4. XML Use Considerations and Recommendations

   This section notes several aspects of XML and makes recommendations
   for use.  Since the 1998 publication of XML version 1 [29], an
   editorial second edition [8] was published in 2000; this section
   refers to the second edition.

4.1 XML Declarations

   An XML declaration (defined in section 2.8 of [8]) is a small header
   at the beginning of an XML data stream that indicates the XML version
   and the character encoding used.  For example,

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

   specifies the use of XML version 1 and UTF-8 character encoding.

   Protocol specifications must be clear about use of XML declarations.
   In some cases, the XML used is a small fragment in a larger context,
   where the XML version and character encoding are specified
   externally.  In those cases, the XML declaration might add extra
   overhead.  In other cases, the XML is a larger component which may
   find its way alone as an external entity body, transported as a MIME
   message.  In those cases, the XML declaration is an important marker
   and useful for reliability and extensibility.  In general, an XML
   protocol element should either disallow XML declarations ("MUST NOT
   be used") or require one ("MUST have").  A design which allows but
   does not require an XML declaration leads to unreliable
   implementations.  When in doubt, require an XML declaration.

4.2 XML Processing Instructions

   An XML processing instruction (defined in section 2.6 of [8]) is a
   component of an XML document that signals extra "out of band"
   information to the receiver; a common use of XML processing
   instructions are for document applications.  For example, the XML2RFC
   application used to generate this document and described in [25]
   supports a "table of contents" processing instruction:

   <?rfc toc="yes"?>

   Again, protocol specifications must be clear about whether -- and if
   so, what kind of -- XML processing instructions are allowed.
   However, XML processing instructions appear to have rare
   applicability to XML fragments embedded in Internet protocols, and it
   is recommended that their use be explicitly disallowed ("MUST NOT
   use").  In cases where XML processing instructions are allowed, the
   nature of the allowable processing instructions should be specified

Internet-Draft            XML in IETF Protocols               April 2002


   explicitly.

4.3 Well-Formedness

   A well-formed XML instance is one in which all character and markup
   data conforms to a specific set of structural rules defined in
   section 2.1 of [8].

   An XML instance that is not well-formed is not really XML; well-
   formedness is the basis for syntactic compatibility with XML.
   Without well-formedness, most of the advantages of using XML
   disappear.  For this reason, it is imperative that protocol
   specifications REQUIRE that XML instances be well-formed.

4.4 Validity

   Beyond well-formedness there are additional mechanisms that define a
   set of structural and data format constraints.  Two mechanisms are
   commonly used to define grammars for classes of XML documents:
   Document Type Definition (DTD) (defined in section 2.8 of [8]) and
   XML Schema (defined in [10] and [11]).

   DTDs are an older technology that has been found to have drawbacks,
   particularly in the features provided for extensibility and data
   typing.  XML Schema was designed to address many DTD shortcomings.
   For example, with a DTD a validating parser can confirm that an
   element contains character data, but with XML Schema a validating
   parser can also confirm that the value of an element matches a
   particular regular expression.

   XML Schema provides powerful features to define a complete and
   precise specification of allowable protocol syntax and data type
   definitions.  In order to obtain the advantages of XML as a data
   structure specification system, protocol specifications should supply
   an XML Schema and insist that XML instances MUST be valid according
   to that schema.

4.5 Namespaces

   XML namespaces, defined in [9], provide a means of assigning markup
   to a specific vocabulary.  If two elements or attributes from
   different vocabularies have the same name, they can be distinguished
   unambiguously if they belong to different namespaces.  Additionally,
   namespaces provide significant support for protocol extensibility as
   they can be defined, reused, and processed dynamically.

   Markup vocabulary collisions are very possible when namespaces are
   not used to separate and uniquely identify vocabularies.  Protocol



Hollenbeck, et al.       Expires October 4, 2002               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft            XML in IETF Protocols               April 2002


   definitions should use existing XML namespaces where appropriate.
   When new namespaces are needed, the namespace name (a URI) should be
   defined within the RFC itself, and the IETF URN namespace described
   in [20] should be used to designate the namespace; for example:

   abc:xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:abc"

4.6 Element and Attribute Design Considerations

   XML provides much flexibility in allowing a designer to use either
   elements or element attributes to carry data.  Element attributes are
   generally intended to contain meta-data that describes the value of
   the element, and as such they are subject to the following
   restrictions:

   o  Attributes are unordered, and

   o  Attribute values can only contain simple XML data types.

   Consider the following example that describes an IP address using a
   "type" attribute to describe the address value:

               <address type="ipv4">10.1.2.3</address>

   XML allows the same information to be encapsulated using a <type>
   element instead of a "type" attribute:

               <address>
                 <type>ipv4</type>
                 <value>10.1.2.3</value>
               </address>

   The preferred form is used in the first example, where the "type"
   attribute is used to describe the value of the <address> element.

   Consistent use of elements and element attributes is a characteristic
   of a sound design.  Protocols are strongly urged to use elements as
   the primary XML data encapsulation structure.  Attributes used in
   protocol elements should contain only meta-data that describes the
   value of the enclosing element.

4.7 Binary Data

   XML is defined as a character stream rather than a stream of octets,
   and such there are no ways of embedding binary data directly within
   an XML data stream.  XML Schema [11] defines one encoding of binary
   data using Base64 [23] and another using hexadecimal digits.

Internet-Draft            XML in IETF Protocols               April 2002


   Other protocols transmit binary data using some other communication
   channel, and include, in the XML data itself, a reference (using the
   anyURI data type).

   Protocols that need a container that can hold both structural data
   and large quantities of binary data should consider carefully whether
   XML is appropriate, since the Base64 and hex encodings are
   inefficient.  Otherwise, protocols should use the mechanisms of XML
   Schema to represent binary data; the Base64 encoding is best for
   larger quantities of data, while the hex encoding will work for short
   bit strings.

5. Internationalization Considerations

   This section describes internationalization considerations for the
   use of XML to represent data in IETF protocols.  Readers should be
   familiar with IETF policy on the use of character sets and languages
   as described in RFC 2277 [3].

5.1 Character Sets

   XML provides native support for encoding information using the
   Unicode character set and its more compact representations including
   UTF-8 [4] and UTF-16 [26].  Other encodings are also supported and
   can be specified using an "encoding" attribute in a document's XML
   declaration.  It is strongly recommended that UTF-8 be mandated for
   protocols that represent data using XML.

   Guidelines for the use of XML declarations can be found in Section
   4.1.  If an XML declaration is omitted, it is strongly urged to
   require use of a consistent character set, and to require UTF-8 as
   the most appropriate character set.  If an XML declaration is
   allowed, it is again strongly urged to require use of a consistent
   character set, to require UTF-8 as the most appropriate character
   set, and to recommend inclusion of an "encoding" attribute that
   explicitly notes use of UTF-8 encoding.

5.2 Language Declaration

   Text encapsulated in XML can be represented in many different human
   languages, and it is often useful to explicitly identify the language
   used to present the text.  XML version 1 defines a special attribute
   in the "xml" namespace, xml:lang, that can be used to specify the
   language used to represent data in an XML document.  The xml:lang
   attribute and the values it can assume are defined in section 2.12 of
   [8].

   It is strongly recommended that protocols representing data in a
   human language mandate use of an xml:lang attribute if the XML
   instance might be interpreted in language-dependent contexts.

5.3 Other Considerations

   There are standard mechanisms in the typography of some human
   languages that can be difficult to represent using merely XML
   character string data types.  For example, pronunciation clues can be
   provided using Ruby annotation [32], and embedding controls (such as
   those described in section 3.4 of [36]) or an XHTML [33] "dir"
   attribute can be used to note the proper display direction for
   bidirectional text.

   It is strongly recommended that protocols representing data in a
   human language reuse existing mechanisms as needed to ensure proper

Internet-Draft            XML in IETF Protocols               April 2002


6. IANA Considerations

   This section does not contain any specific directives for IANA.
   However, when XML is used in an IETF protocol there are multiple
   factors that might require IANA action, including:

   o  XML media types.  Some protocols have protocol elements that are
      MIME bodies, and allow MIME labeling.  In cases where a MIME label
      is used to identify a protocol element the MIME labeling policies
      defined in RFC 3023 [5] should be followed and an XML declaration
      should be present.  The "application/xml" media type is most
      appropriate for general XML; if a new media type is expected, it
      should be registered.

   o  URI registration.  There is an ongoing effort [20] to create a URN
      namespace explicitly for defining URIs for namespace names and
      other URI-designated protocol elements for use within IETF
      standards track documents; it might also establish IETF policy for
      such use.

7. Security Considerations

   Being text-based, protocols built with XML face significant threats,
   including unintended disclosure, modification, and replay.  Simple
   passive attacks, such as packet sniffing, allow an attacker to
   capture and view information intended for someone else.  Captured
   data can be modified and replayed to the original intended recipient,
   with the recipient having no way to know that the information has
   been compromised, detect modifications, be assured of the sender's
   identity, or to confirm which protocol instance is legitimate.

   Several security service options are available mitigate these risks.
   Though XML does not include any built-in security services, other
   protocols and protocol layers provide services that can be used to
   protect XML protocols.  XML encryption [12] provides privacy services
   to prevent unintended disclosure.  Canonical XML [6] XML digital
   signatures [7] provide integrity services to detect modification and
   authentication services to confirm the identity of the data source.
   Other IETF security protocols (e.g., the Transport Layer Security
   (TLS) protocol [2]) are also available to protect data and service
   endpoints as appropriate.  Given the lack of security services in
   XML, it is imperative that protocol specifications REQUIRE additional
   security services to counter common threats and attacks; the specific
   required services will depend on the protocol's threat model.
