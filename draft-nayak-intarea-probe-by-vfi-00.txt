            Probing IP Interfaces By Virtual Function Index
                  draft-nayak-intarea-probe-by-vfi-00

Abstract

   This document enhances the PROBE diagnostic tool so that it can
   identify the probed interface by Virtual Function Index.  In order to
   achieve that goal, this document also extends the Interface
   Identification Object.  The Interface Identification Object is an
   ICMP Extension Object class.

1.  Problem Statement

   PROBE [RFC8335] is a diagnostic tool that can be used to query the
   status of an interface.  PROBE sends an ICMP Extended Echo Request
   message to a proxy interface.  The ICMP Extended Echo Request message
   contains an ICMP Extension Structure and the ICMP Extension Structure
   contains an Interface Identification Object.  The Interface
   Identification Object identifies the probed interface by name,
   ifIndex or address.

   When the proxy interface receives the ICMP Extended Echo Request, the
   node upon which it resides executes access control procedures.  If
   access is granted, the node determines the status of the probed
   interface and returns an ICMP Extended Echo Reply message.  The ICMP
   Extended Echo Reply indicates the status of the probed interface.

   This document enhances the PROBE so that it can identify the probed
   interface by Virtual Function Index (VFI) [SR-IOV].  In order to
   achieve that goal, this document extends the Interface Identification
   Object.  The Interface Identification Object is an ICMP Extension
   Object class.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP

   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  ICMP Extended Echo Request Message

   Section 2.1 of [RFC8335] defines the ICMP Extended Echo Request
   message.  As per [RFC8335], the ICMP Extended Echo Request message
   contains the following fields:

   o  Type

   o  Code

   o  Checksum

   o  Identifier

   o  Reserved

   o  L (local)

   o  ICMP Extension Structure

   Section 7 of [RFC4884] defines the ICMP Extension Structure.  As per
   [RFC4884], the Extension Structure contains exactly one Extension
   Header followed by one or more objects.  When applied to the ICMP
   Extended Echo Request message, the ICMP Extension Structure contains
   exactly one instance of the Interface Identification Object.
   Section 2.1 of [RFC8335] defines the Interface Identification Object.
   Section 4 of this document extends that definition.

   If the L-bit is set, the Interface Identification Object can identify
   the probed interface by name, index, address or VFI.  If the L-bit is
   clear, the Interface Identification Object identifies the probed
   interface by address.

4.  Interface Identification Object

   Section 2.1 of [RFC8335] defines the Interface Identification Object.
   The Interface Identification Object identifies the probed interface
   by name, index, or address.  Like any other ICMP Extension Object, it
   contains an Object Header and Object Payload.  The Object Header
   contains the following fields:

   o  Class-Num: Interface Identification Object.  The value is 3.

   o  C-Type: Determines how the probed interface is identified.

   o  Length: Length of the object, measured in octets, including the
      Object Header and Object Payload.

   Currently, the following values are defined for C-Type:

   o  (0) Reserved

   o  (1) Identifies Interface by Name

   o  (2) Identifies Interface by Index

   o  (3) Identifies Interface by Address

   This document defines the following, new C-Type:

   o  (value TBD by IANA) Identifies Interfaces by Virtual Function
      Index (VFI)

   If the Interface Identification Object identifies the probed
   interface by Virtual Function Index, the length is equal to 8 and the
   payload contains the Virtual Function Index.

5.  ICMP Extended Echo Reply Message

   Section 3 of [RFC8335] defines the ICMP Extended Echo Reply message.
   This document does not change that definition.

6.  ICMP Message Processing

   Section 4 of [RFC8335] defines the ICMP message processing.  This
   document does not change that definition.

7.  Updates To RFC 8335

   Section 2 of [RFC8335] states:

   "If the L-bit is set, the Interface Identification Object can
   identify the probed interface by name, index, or address.  If the
   L-bit is clear, the Interface Identification Object MUST identify the
   probed interface by address."

   This document updates that text as follows:

   "If the L-bit is set, the Interface Identification Object can
   identify the probed interface by name, index, address, or Virtual
   Function Index (VFI).  If the L-bit is clear, the Interface
   Identification Object MUST identify the probed interface by address."

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add the following a new C-type:

   o  (value TBD by IANA) Identifies Interfaces by Virtual Function
      Index (VFI)

   This new C-Type is to be added to the Interface Identification Object
   under the "ICMP Extension Object Classes and Class Sub-types"
   registry.

9.  Security Considerations

   This documen neither extends nor mitigates any of the security
   considerations mentioned in [RFC8335].

10.  Acknowledgements

   The authors wish to acknowledge Ross Callon for his helpful comments.
