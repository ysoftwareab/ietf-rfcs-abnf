            CNAME at apex - a website publisher perspective
            draft-york-dnsop-cname-at-apex-publisher-view-01

Abstract

   There has been a large amount of discussion about the "CNAME at apex"
   issue within the DNSOP Working Group.  This draft provides the
   perspective of one publisher of multiple websites about why CNAME-
   like functionality is desirable at the apex of a domain zone.

1.  Introduction

   From the early days of the Web, publishers of websites generally
   operated their main public website using the "www" subdomain, as in
   "www.example.com".

   In recent years many organizations have moved to dropping the "www"
   and referring to their main website by simply the domain name, as in
   "example.com".  There are numerous reasons for this change, including
   the simplicity of saying or writing the name and also smaller address
   bars on mobile browsers.  If you are designing a large advertisement
   to display in, say, an airport hallway, you can make the domain name
   address larger and more visibile if you simply use "example.com" and
   drop the "www".  Additionally, some web browsers are no longer
   showing the full URL (or even any of the URL) and so the "www" is no
   longer visible.

   Regardless of the reasons, the fact is that many website publishers
   and marketing/communications teams are moving to using only the
   domain name without the "www" or other subdomains to reference their
   public website.

   The expectations from the marketing / communications teams are that:

   1.  users will be able to simply enter "example.com" into their
       browser; and

   2.  users will only see "example.com" in their address bar (if URLs
       are even displayed).

2.  The Challenge

   If the organization's website is a simple web server with specific A
   and AAAA records, this change can be easily implemented by adding the
   appropriate A and AAAA records at the zone apex.

   However, most larger site publishers (and many smaller publishers)
   now use content distribution networks (CDNs), global load balancers,
   or some other form of a caching / load balancing network in front of
   their website.  The result is that there is no single "A" or "AAAA"
   record for the organization's website.

   Publishers use CDNs for a variety of reasons, including:

   o  Performance - connecting users to an edge server with the lowest
      latency

   o  Geo-location - connecting users to edge servers appropriate for
      their geography

   o  DDoS / security - using various security mechanisms provided by
      CDNs

   o  IPv6 - using a CDN to offer IPv6 access when the origin server is
      only on IPv4

   o  TLS - using a CDN to offer higher levels of TLS usage than
      possible with origin server

   While there may be many non-CDN mechanisms to address those reasons,
   website publishers in 2018 are increasingly using CDNs as a simple
   business solution.

   The DNS issue is that the website publisher is told to simply
   redirect all traffic to some address within the CDN along the lines
   of one of these:

   o  a123qkt5y7xxb3df8.example-cdn.net

   o  (companyname).example-cdn.net

   o  (companyname).(location).example-cdn.net

   o  some-random-string.example-cdn.net

   The CDN then performs its service of providing the requesting client
   with the A or AAAA record most appropriate for the client's network/
   geographic location.

2.1.  Note

   Some CDNs require that they manage the DNS services for the target
   domain name.  The publisher must designate the CDN's DNS servers as
   the authoritative name servers (NS records) for the domain.  At that
   point the CDN handles all of the name resolution directly and
   dynamically returns the A and AAAA records back to the client web
   browser.  The browser has no idea that a CDN is in usage.

   However, this document is discussing CDNs where the publisher retains
   control of serving out DNS records for the domain.

3.  CNAME works for subdomains

   For websites using a subdomain such as "www", this is simply done in
   DNS using CNAME and pointing to a target URL provided by the CDN:

   www.example.com  300  IN  CNAME a123qkt5y7xxb3df8.example-cdn.net

   Now all web traffic to www.example.com is redirected to the CDN
   address.  The CDN returns the appropriate A and AAAA records.  This
   all works and the browser connects to the site hosted on one of the
   CDN edge servers.

4.  CNAME at apex does not work

   For reasons outlined in Appendix C of [I-D.ietf-dnsop-aname] CNAME
   does not work at the apex of a domain.  A primary reason is section
   3.6.2 of [RFC1034].

5.  Proprietary solutions

   To respond to this business demand, various DNS operators (including
   CDN providers who also act as DNS operators) have developed
   proprietary solutions (also referred to as "stupid DNS tricks" within
   the DNSOP community).  Under various names such as "URL flattening"
   or "CNAME flattening", these techniques do work and allow the sites
   to be accessible on the CDN via the simple domain name.

5.1.  Proprietary lockin

   However, because of the proprietary nature, they then lock the
   website publisher into using that DNS operator / CDN.  The website
   publisher does not have an easily ability to move to a different DNS

Internet-DraftCNAME at apex - a website publisher perspectiNovember 2018


   operator / CDN unless the new DNS operator / CDN can also provide a
   mechanism to allow the non-www domain usage.

5.2.  Restriction on using multiple CDNs

   Additionally, many large web site publishers use (or want to use)
   multiple CDNs to achieve various business objectives, including
   resiliency / availability.  The lack of a standard mechanism to do
   this "CNAME at apex" functionality limits the ability to explore
   multi-CDN options.

6.  Existing and proposed solutions

   Various email discussions have indicated that existing mechanisms can
   address this issue, although deployment/adoption concerns have been
   raised.  Existing solutions include:

   o  SRV record - [RFC2052]

   o  URI record - [RFC7553]

   o  NAPTR-based solutions (need to understand more)

   Multiple solutions have been proposed for discussion at IETF 103,
   including:

   o  [I-D.ietf-dnsop-aname]

   o  [I-D.bellis-dnsop-http-record]

7.  Author opinion

   As a website publisher, I have a business objective to meet - make
   the site accessible over "example.com" versus "www.example.com".  As
   long as this can happen in a manner that can be widely deployed, I am
   not partial to any specific solution.  I just want it to work and not
   lock me in to specific proprietary solutions.

8.  Past discussion

   There was a lengthy discussion of this topic in the DNSOP session at
   IETF 102 in Montreal in 2018.  Slides from that session are useful
   for more context:
