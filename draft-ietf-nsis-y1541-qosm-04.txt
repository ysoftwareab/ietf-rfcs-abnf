1. Introduction

   This draft describes a QoS model (QOSM) for NSIS QoS signaling
   layer protocol (QoS-NSLP) application based on ITU-T Recommendation
   Y.1541 QoS signaling requirements.  Y.1541 currently specifies 8
   standard QoS classes, and the Y.1541-QOSM extensions include
   additional QSPEC parameters and QOSM processing guidelines.  The
   extensions are based on standardization work in the ITU-T on QoS
   signaling requirements [Y.1541, TRQ-QoS-SIG, E.361].

   [QoS-SIG] defines message types and control information for the
   QoS-NSLP generic to all QOSMs.  A QOSM is a defined mechanism for
   achieving QoS as a whole. The specification of a QOSM includes a
   description of its QSPEC parameter information, as well as how that
   information should be treated or interpreted in the network.  The
   QSPEC [QSPEC] contains a set of parameters and values describing the
   requested resources. It is opaque to the QoS-NSLP and similar in
   purpose to the TSpec, RSpec and AdSpec specified in [RFC2205,
   RFC2210].  The QSPEC object contains the QoS parameters defined by
   the QOSM.  A QOSM provides a specific set of parameters to be carried
   in the QSPEC.  At each QoS NSIS element (QNE), the QSPEC contents are
   interpreted by the resource management function (RMF) for purposes of
   policy control and traffic control, including admission control and
   configuration of the scheduler.

2. Summary of ITU-T Recommendations Y.1541 & Signaling Requirements

   As stated above, [Y.1541] is a specification of standardized QoS
   classes for IP networks (a summary of these classes is given below).
   [TRQ-QoS-SIG] specifies the requirements for achieving end-to-end QoS
   in IP networks, with Y.1541 QoS classes as a basis.  [Y.1541]
   recommends a flexible allocation of the end-to-end performance
   objectives (e.g., delay) across networks, rather than a fixed
   per-network allocation.  NSIS protocols already address most of the
   requirements, this document identifies additional QSPEC parameters
   and processing requirements needed to support the Y.1541 QOSM.

2.1 Y.1541 QoS Classes

   [Y.1541] proposes grouping services into QoS classes defined
   according to the desired QoS performance objectives. These QoS
   classes support a wide range of user applications.  The classes group
   objectives for one-way IP packet delay, IP packet delay variation, IP
   packet loss ratio, etc.  Classes 0 and 1, which generally correspond
   to the DiffServ EF PHB, support interactive real-time applications.
   Classes 2, 3, and 4, which generally correspond to the DiffServ AFxy
   PHB Group, support non-interactive applications.  Class 5, which
   generally corresponds to the DiffServ best-effort PHB, has all the
   QoS parameters unspecified.  Classes 6 and 7 provide support for
   extremely loss-sensitive user applications, such as high quality
   digital television, TDM circuit emulation, and high capacity
   transfers using TCP.  These classes serve as a basis for agreements
   between end-users and service providers, and between service
   providers. They support a wide range of traffic applications
   including point-to-point telephony, data transfer, multimedia
   conferencing, and others.  The limited number of classes supports the
   requirement for feasible implementation, particularly with respect to
   scale in global networks.

   The QoS classes apply to a packet flow, where [Y.1541] defines a
   packet flow as the traffic associated with a given connection or
   connectionless stream having the same source host, destination host,
   class of service, and session identification.  The characteristics of
   each Y.1451 QoS class are summarized here:

   Class 0: Real-time, highly interactive applications, sensitive to
   jitter.  Mean delay upper bound is 100 ms, delay variation is less
   than 50 ms, and loss ratio is less than 10^-3. Application examples
   include VoIP, Video Teleconference.

   Class 1: Real-time, interactive applications, sensitive to jitter.
   Mean delay upper bound is 400 ms, delay variation is less than 50 ms,
   and loss ratio is less than 10^-3. Application examples include VoIP,
   video teleconference.

   Class 2: Highly interactive transaction data. Mean delay upper bound

Ash, et. al.         <draft-ietf-nsis-y1541-qosm-04.txt>       [Page 3]

Internet Draft       Y.1541-QOSM for Y.1541 QoS Classes      April 2007


   is 100 ms, delay variation is unspecified, and loss ratio is less
   Than 10^-3.  Application examples include signaling.

   Class 3: Interactive transaction data. Mean delay upper bound is 400
   ms, delay variation is unspecified, and loss ratio is less than
   10^-3.  Application examples include signaling.

   Class 4: Low Loss Only applications. Mean delay upper bound is 1s,
   delay variation is unspecified, and loss ratio is less than 10^-3.
   Application examples include short transactions, bulk data, video
   streaming

   Class 5: Unspecified applications with unspecified mean delay, delay
   variation, and loss ratio. Application examples include traditional
   applications of Default IP Networks

   Class 6:
   Mean delay <= 100 ms, delay variation <= 50 ms, loss ratio <= 10^-5.
   Applications that are highly sensitive to loss, such as television
   transport, high-capacity TCP transfers, and TDM circuit emulation.

   Class 7:
   Mean delay <= 400 ms, delay variation <= 50 ms, loss ratio <= 10^-5.
   Applications that are highly sensitive to loss, such as television
   transport, high-capacity TCP transfers, and TDM circuit emulation.

   These classes enable SLAs to be defined between customers and network
   service providers with respect to QoS requirements. The service
   provider then needs to ensure that the requirements are recognized
   and receive appropriate treatment across network layers.

2.2 Y.1541-QOSM Processing Requirements

   [TRQ-QoS-SIG] provides the requirements for signaling information
   regarding IP-based QoS at the interface between the user and the
   network (UNI) and across interfaces between different networks (NNI).
   To meet specific network performance requirements specified for the
   Y.1541 QoS classes, a network needs to provide specific user plane
   functionality at UNI and NNI interfaces.  Dynamic network
   provisioning at a UNI and/or NNI node allows the ability to
   dynamically request a traffic contract for an IP flow from a specific
   source node to one or more destination nodes. In response to the
   request, the network determines if resources are available to satisfy
   the request and provision the network.

   It MUST be possible to derive the following service level parameters
   as part of the process of requesting service:

   a. Y.1541 QoS class
   b. rate (r)
   c. peak rate (p)

Ash, et. al.         <draft-ietf-nsis-y1541-qosm-04.txt>       [Page 4]

Internet Draft       Y.1541-QOSM for Y.1541 QoS Classes      April 2007


   d. bucket size (b)
   e. peak bucket size (Bp)
   f. maximum packet size (M)
   g. DiffServ PHB class [RFC2475]
   h. admission priority
   i. restoration priority

   All parameters except Bp, M, and restoration priority have already
   been specified in [QSPEC].  These additional parameters are specified
   in Section 3.

   It MUST be possible to perform the following QoS-NSLP signaling
   functions to meet Y.1541-QOSM requirements:

   a. accumulate delay, delay variation and loss ratio across the
      end-to-end connection, which may span multiple domains
   b. enable negotiation of Y.1541 QoS class across domains.
   c. enable negotiation of delay, delay variation, and loss ratio
      across domains.

   These signaling requirements are already supported by [QoS-SIG] and
   the functions are illustrated in Section 4.

3. Additional QSPEC Parameters for Y.1541 QOSM

3.1 Traffic Model (TMOD) Extension Parameter

   The traffic model (TMOD) extension parameter is represented by
   one floating point number in single-precision IEEE floating point
   format and one 32-bit unsigned integer.

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Peak Bucket Size [Bp] (32-bit IEEE floating point number)    |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |      Maximum Packet Size [M] (32-bit unsigned integer)        |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   When the Bp term is represented as an IEEE floating point value, the
   sign bit MUST be zero (all values MUST be non-negative).  Exponents
   less than 127 (i.e., 0) are prohibited.  Exponents greater than 162
   (i.e., positive 35) are discouraged, except for specifying a peak
   rate of infinity.  Infinity is represented with an exponent of all
   ones (255) and a sign bit and mantissa of all zeroes.  The maximum
   packet size (M) is an unsigned integer.

3.2 Restoration Priority Parameter

   Restoration priority is the urgency with which a service requires
   successful restoration under failure conditions.  Restoration

Ash, et. al.         <draft-ietf-nsis-y1541-qosm-04.txt>       [Page 5]

Internet Draft       Y.1541-QOSM for Y.1541 QoS Classes      April 2007


   priority is achieved by provisioning sufficient backup capacity, as
   necessary, and allowing relative priority for access to available
   bandwidth when there is contention for restoration bandwidth.
   Restoration priority is defined as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Rest. Priority|                  (Reserved)                   |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Restoration Priority:
   3 priority values are listed here in the order of lowest priority to
   highest priority:

   0 - best effort
   1 - normal
   2 - high

   Each restoration priority class has two parameters:

   a. Time-to-Restore: Total amount of time to restore traffic streams
   belonging to a given restoration class impacted by the failure. This
   time period depends on the technology deployed for restoration. A
   fast recovery period of < 200 ms is based on current experience with
   SONET rings and a slower recovery period of 2 seconds is suggested in
   order to enable a voice call to recover without being dropped.
   Accordingly, candidate restoration objectives are:

   High Restoration Priority: Time-to-Restore <= 200 ms
   Normal Restoration Priority: Time-to-Restore <= 2 s.
   Best Effort Restoration Priority: Time-to-Restore = Unspecified

   b. Extent of Restoration: Percentage of traffic belonging to the
   restoration class that can be restored. This percentage depends on
   the amount of spare capacity engineered. All high priority
   restoration priority traffic, for example, may be "guaranteed" at
   100% by the service provider. Other classes may offer lesser chances
   for successful restoration. The restoration extent for these lower
   priority classes depend on SLA agreements developed between the
   service provider and the customer.

4. Y.1541-QOSM Processing Example

   In this Section we illustrate the operation of the Y.1541 QOSM, and
   show how current QoS-NSLP and QSPEC functionality is used.  No new
   processing capabilities or parameters are required to enable the
   Y.1541 QOSM.

   As described in the example given in [QSPEC] (Section 4.4) and as
   illustrated in Figure 1, the QoS NSIS initiator (QNI) initiates an

Ash, et. al.         <draft-ietf-nsis-y1541-qosm-04.txt>       [Page 6]

Internet Draft       Y.1541-QOSM for Y.1541 QoS Classes      April 2007


   end-to-end, inter-domain QoS NSLP RESERVE message containing the
   Initiator QSPEC.  In the case of the Y.1541 QOSM, the Initiator QSPEC
   specifies the <Y.1541 QOS Class>, <TMOD>, <TMOD Extension>,
   <Admission Priority>, <Restoration Priority>, and perhaps other QSPEC
   parameters for the flow.  As described in Section 3, the TMOD
   extension parameter contains the optional, Y.1541-QOSM-specific
   parameters Bp and M; restoration priority is also an optional,
   Y.1541-QOSM-specific parameter.

   As illustrated in Figure 1, the RESERVE message may cross multiple
   domains supporting different QOSMs.  In this illustration, the
   initiator QSPEC arrives in an QoS NSLP RESERVE message at the ingress
   node of the local-QOSM domain.  As described in [QoS-SIG] and
   [QSPEC], at the ingress edge node of the local-QOSM domain, the
   end-to-end, inter-domain QoS-NSLP message may trigger the generation
   of a local QSPEC, and the initiator QSPEC encapsulated within the
   messages signaled through the local domain.  The local QSPEC is used
   for QoS processing in the local-QOSM domain, and the Initiator QSPEC
   is used for QoS processing outside the local domain.  As specified in
   [QSPEC], if any QNE cannot meet the requirements designated by the
   initiator QSPEC to support an optional QSPEC parameter, with the M
   bit set to zero for the parameter, for example, it cannot support the
   accumulation of end-to-end delay with the <Path Latency> parameter,
   the QNE sets the N flag (not supported flag) for the path latency
   parameter to one.

   Also, the Y.1541-QOSM requires negotiation of the <Y.1541 QoS Class>
   across domains.  This negotiation can be done with the use of the
   existing procedures already defined in [QoS-SIG].  For example, the
   QNI sets <Desired QoS>, <Minimum QoS>, <Available QoS> objects to
   include <Y.1541 QoS Class>, <Path Latency>, <Path Jitter>, <Path BER>
   parameters.  The QNE/domain SHOULD set the Y.1541 class and
   cumulative parameters, e.g., <Path Latency>, that can be achieved in
   the <QoS Available> object (but not less than specified in <Minimum
   QoS>).  This could include, for example, setting the <Y.1541 QoS
   Class> to a lower class than specified in <QoS Desired> (but not
   lower than specified in <Minimum QoS>).  If the <Available QoS>
   fails to satisfy one or more of the <Minimum QoS> objectives, the
   QNE/domain notifies the QNI and the reservation is aborted.
   Otherwise, the QNR notifies the QNI of the <QoS Available> for the
   reservation.

   When the available <Y.1541 QoS Class> must be reduced from the
   desired <Y.1541 QoS Class>, say because the delay objective
   has been exceeded, then there is an incentive to respond with an
   available value for delay in the <Path Latency> parameter.  If the
   available <Path Latency> is 150 ms (still useful for many
   applications) and the desired QoS is Class 0 (with its 100 ms
   objective), then the response would be that Class 0 cannot be
   achieved and Class 1 is available (with its 400 ms objective).  In
   addition, this QOSM allows the response to include an available

Ash, et. al.         <draft-ietf-nsis-y1541-qosm-04.txt>       [Page 7]

Internet Draft       Y.1541-QOSM for Y.1541 QoS Classes      April 2007


   <Path Latency> = 150 ms, making acceptance of the available <Y.1541
   QoS Class> more likely.  There are many long paths where the
   propagation delay alone exceeds the Y.1541 Class 0 objective, so
   this feature adds flexibility to commit to exceed the Class 1
   objective when possible.

   This example illustrates Y.1541-QOSM negotiation of <Y.1541 QoS
   Class> and cumulative parameter values that can be achieve
   end-to-end.  The example illustrates how the QNI can use the
   cumulative values collected in <QoS Available> to decide if a lower
   <Y.1541 QoS Class> than specified in <QoS Desired> is acceptable.

5. Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [QoS-SIG] and [QSPEC] apply to this
   Document. There are no new security considerations based on this
   document.

6. IANA Considerations

   This section defines the registries and initial codepoint assignments
   for the QSPEC template, in accordance with BCP 26 RFC 2434 [RFC2434].
   It also defines the procedural requirements to be followed by IANA in
   allocating new codepoints.

   This document specifies the following QSPEC parameters to be assigned
   within the QSPEC Parameter ID registry created in [QSPEC]:

   <TMOD Extension> parameter (Section 3.1)
   <Restoration Priority> parameter (Section 3.2)
  
   This specification creates the following registry with the structure
   as defined below:
