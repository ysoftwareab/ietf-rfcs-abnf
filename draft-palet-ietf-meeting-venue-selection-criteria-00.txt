Internet-Draft    IETF Meeting Venue Selection Criteria        July 2005


1.  Introduction

   The IETF meetings are an important part of the IETF process and their
   hosting and organizacion must be carefully planned in order to make
   sure that the attendees take advantage of their time at the meeting
   with a minimum set of guarantees for maximizing their performance,
   which also avoids unexpected situations and expenses (for example in
   case of a meeting cancellation, lack of adecuate working conditions,
   lack of reliable connectivity, etc.).

   This document describes elementos for both, logistic and technical
   criteria for the venue selection, logistic and technical contingency
   measures, as well as details related to the planning and timing.

2.  Logistic criteria for the venue selection

   The average attendance to an IETF meeting is about 1.300 people,
   however it may span up to 2.300 people in some circunstances (for
   instance, meeting location).

   Considering this, the suggested venue meeting room capacity is
   calculated for about 1.600 people, including meeting space of about
   60.000/5.500 square feets/meters.

   The following table shows the needs for meeting rooms and their
   expected size including a few days before the meeting, considering
   the usual setup time.

   Meeting Rooms Requirements

                                  Table 1

   Note that some of the meeting rooms can be used for several
   functions, according to the meeting schedule, for example the plenary
   meeting room is used only when the rest of the sessions aren't
   ocurring, breaks and registration area in the follie, etc.

   All the meeting rooms should be provided with sufficient number of
   power sockets and cords for connecting the laptops of about 80% of
   the expected attendees.

   The rooms are holded in a 24 hours basis, and should be possible to
   use the at any time w/o restrictions, except for the required timing
   of the cleaning service.

   Furthermore, the requirements for sleeping rooms will be a block of
   around 5.515 rooms/nights.

   The following table shows the needs for sleeping rooms including a
   few days before the meeting.

   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-------+-------+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun |  Mon  |  Tue  | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat |
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-------+-------+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   |  5  | 100 | 450 | 980 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 970 | 770 | 200 |  40 |
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-------+-------+-----+-----+-----+-----+

   Sleeping Rooms Requirements

                                  Table 2

   The location of the hotel should be such that allows a quick movement
   of the attendees between the sleeping and the meeting rooms.  Is
   strongly suggested that the meeting rooms are in fact located in the
   main hotel (which a minimum capacity of about 60% of the required
   sleeping rooms).

   If the meeting rooms are not located in the same place as the main
   block of sleeping rooms, the inexpensive public transport means
   should allow the movement of 100% of the attendees in less than 30
   minutes, considering the meeting timming and usual public transport
   utilization by the locals.

   The ideal situation is that a number of alternative hotels are at
   walking distance (10-15 minutes) from the event venue.

   Moreover, the attendees should be able to get food for lunch and
   dinner, according to the meeting timing, in a maximum of 90-120
   minutes.

   Regarding the city where the venue is located, is required a certain
   degree of security/safety, understanding that the attendees come from
   all over the world.

   Is expected that the nearby airport is located no more than 50
   Kilometers from the main hotels, and again inexpensive public
   transportation is available.

   The airport should be of such capacity to accomodate 60% of the
   attendees arriving and departing on the same day, in addition to the
   usual number of passengers.

   The traveling cost to the venue location (average economic air fare)

Internet-Draft    IETF Meeting Venue Selection Criteria        July 2005


   should affordable, not exceed the 1.000 USD.  If it's much more
   expensive, it may be acceptable only in the case the sleeping room
   cost is lower than the expected average (150 USD per night in the
   main hotels).

   The traveling to te venue location should be possible from most of
   the attendees (60%) with a maximum of 3 flight-hops, desirable 2.

   Finally, the country hosting the event should not limit the
   attendance for any participant, with reasonable visa regulations
   which don't take any unnecessary overhead neither from the
   organization of the atteendees itself.  If the attendee need to
   invest more than 2 hours on the process, the country should be
   rejected as a candidate to host the IETF.

3.  Technical criteria for the venue selection

   In order to accomodate the IETF meeting with technical guarantees of
   sucesfull working capabilities for the attendees, the following
   technical issues should be considered:

   This is only a list, need some work.  TBD.

   o  Telecomunicacions room availability

   o  Existing infrastructure: fiber, UTP/distances

   o  Feasibility/facility to setup new cables (fiber/UTP)

   o  Electrical power capacity

   o  Highly reliable Internet link and BW

   o  Facilities for AV, room dimensions for screens (high/wide)

   o  IPv4 unicast

   o  DNS

   o  DHCP

   o  IPv4 multicast

   o  IPv6 unicast

   o  IDS, other security issues

Internet-Draft    IETF Meeting Venue Selection Criteria        July 2005


   o  Managed devices across the entire network ?

   o  Test the network under heavy load

   o  Printers

   o  NOC - primary and backup contacts for all the issues/topics

   o  Provide stats and info on network status

   o  WLAN expertise and debugging/monitoring

   o  Document what can be wrong with the WLAN in advance to inform
      users - FAQ to users

   o  Make the wired network production quality, WLAN experimental ?

   o  Wires to all essential services (e.g. audiocast, chairs,
      presenter, jabber scribe)

   o  White board for the NOC, in visible place


4.  Logistic contingencies

   TBD.

5.  Technical contingencies

   TBD.

6.  Timing/planning

   TBD.

   Timing for network setup and testing.

   24-hours access to meeting rooms for setup and testing.

7.  Venue Acceptance/Rejection Report

   Despite the information provided by the proponent of a given venue,
   the IAD should, before taking a final decision about the acceptance
   or rejection of a given proposed venue, make an on-site survey.

   The on-site survey report will compare the selection criteria against
   the proposal information and the actual on-site findings, describing
   possible discrepancies or issues which may need further

   considerations even if they aren't directly described as part of the
   criteria set outcoming from this docuemnt.

8.  Process and Openness

   In order to demonstrate the complainance with the IETF meeting venue
   selection criteria, all the information related to the proposal of a
   site will be made publicly available in the IETF web site.

   This information will be made public regardless of the site being
   finally selected or not, and should include all the options, such as
   a given city and several venues in the same city, and so on.

   This will not only help the openness of the process but also as
   collective knowledge helping into a better organization and solution
   of issues for future meetings.

   In principle there should not be hidden details to the community
   regarding the proponent and site options and that should be the
   overall rule for the publication of the details.  However, once a
   venue is selected, there may be contractual bindings which may not
   allow to disclose all the negotiation details, which obviously will
   be restricted to a minimum.

   The published information will describe what was offered by the
   proponent, as well as the report about the on-site survey which
   should be done by the IAD before the final acceptance/rejection of a
   given proposed venue.

9.  Other Issues

   Further elaboration is required (TBD) ?

10.  Conclusions

   TBD.

11.  Security Considerations

   This document doesn't have any protocol-related security
   considerations.

12.  Acknowledgements

   The author would like to acknowledge the inputs of TBD.

13.  References
