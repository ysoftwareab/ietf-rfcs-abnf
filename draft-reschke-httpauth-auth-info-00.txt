1.  Introduction

   This specification defines the "Authentication-Info" and "Proxy-
   Authentication-Info" header fields for use in HTTP authentication
   schemes ([RFC7235]) which need to return additional information
   during or after authentication.

   Both were previously defined in Section 3 of [RFC2617], defining the
   HTTP "Digest" authentication scheme.  This document generalizes the
   description for use not only in "Digest" ([DIGEST]), but also other
   future schemes that might have the same requirements for carrying
   additional information during authentication.

2.  Notational Conventions

   This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   notation of [RFC5234] with a list extension, defined in Section 7 of
   [RFC7230], that allows for compact definition of comma-separated
   lists using a '#' operator (similar to how the '*' operator indicates
   repetition).  The ABNF production for "auth-param" is defined in
   Section 2.1 of [RFC7235].

3.  The Authentication-Info Header Field

   HTTP authentication schemes can use the Authentication-Info response
   header field to return additional information applicable to the
   authentication currently in use.

   The field value is a list of parameters (name/value pairs), using the
   "auth-param" syntax defined in Section 2.1 of [RFC7235].  This
   specification only describes the generic format; authentication
   schemes using "Authentication-Info" will define the individual
   parameters.  The "Digest" Authentication Scheme, for instance,
   defines multiple parameters in Section 3.5.1 of [DIGEST].

     Authentication-Info = #auth-param

   The Authentication-Info header field can be used in any HTTP
   response, independently of request method and status code.  Its
   semantics are defined by the applicable authentication scheme.
   Intermediaries are not allowed to modify the field value in any way.
   Authentication-Info can be used inside trailers ([RFC7230], Section
   4.1.2).

3.1.  Parameter Value Format

   Parameter values can be expressed either as "token" or as "quoted-
   string" (Section 3.2.6 of [RFC7230]).

   Authentication scheme definitions need to allow both notations, both
   for senders and recipients.  This allows recipients to use generic
   parsing components, independent of the authentication scheme in use.

   For backwards compatibility, authentication scheme definitions can
   restrict the format for senders to one of the two variants.  This can
   be important when it is known that deployed implementations will fail
   when encountering one of the two formats.

4.  The Proxy-Authentication-Info Header Field

   The Proxy-Authentication-Info header field is equivalent to
   Authentication-Info, except that it applies to proxy authentication
   ([RFC7235]):


     Proxy-Authentication-Info = #auth-param

5.  Security Considerations

   Adding information to HTTP responses can affect security and privacy.
   The presence of the header fields alone indicates that HTTP
   authentication is in use.  Additional information could be exposed by
   the contents of the authentication-scheme specific parameters; this
   will have to be considered in the definitions of these schemes.

6.  IANA Considerations

   HTTP header fields are registered within the "Message Headers"
   registry located at
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers>, as defined by
   [BCP90].

   This document updates the definitions of the "Authentication-Info"
   and "Proxy-Authentication-Info" header fields, so the "Permanent
   Message Header Field Names" registry shall be updated accordingly:

   +---------------------------+----------+----------+-----------------+
   | Header Field Name         | Protocol | Status   | Reference       |
   +---------------------------+----------+----------+-----------------+
   | Authentication-Info       | http     | standard | Section 3 of    |
   |                           |          |          | this document   |
   | Proxy-Authentication-Info | http     | standard | Section 4 of    |
   |                           |          |          | this document   |
   +---------------------------+----------+----------+-----------------+
