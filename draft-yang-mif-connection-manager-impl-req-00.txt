1. Introduction 

   Along with the development of variant access technologies, terminals 
   are capable of being connected with different networks through 
   multiple interfaces. These interfaces may belong to one or multiple 
   network domains. 

   Applications on terminals need to connect with appropriate network 
   domains through interfaces for the requirement of services, or on 
   behalf of users' preference.  

   This document describes an implementation of interface selection by 
   terminal applications, especially for accessing different network 
   domains. A connection management approach is presented. In addition, 
   the document also identifies the problems caused by different 
   implementations among variant vendors.  This will lead to 
   difficulties on customization and development of terminal software. 

2. Scenarios of multiple interfaces 

   A terminal may have multiple interfaces for network connection, e.g. 
   interfaces for connection with GRPS, WiFi, and BlueTooth. An

   application sets up a network connection through one of these 
   interfaces. In fact, different network connections may correspond to 
   different network domains, in which different services are provided. 
   Therefore, an application needs to select the right interface for 
   network access. 

3. Implementation of Connection Manager 

3.1. Connection Handle 

   In terminal, applications use "connection handle" to dial-up or setup 
   connections. This connection handle can be defined in two ways: 

   o Interface based connection handle.          

   o Interface and access node based connection handle. 

   Application may select the appropriate connection handle to setup 
   connections according to configured policy. 

3.2. Interface based connection handle 

   As illustrated in Figure 1, a UE have three types of interfaces, i.e., 
   GRPS, WiFi and Bluetooth. Each interface has one corresponding 
   connection handle as Connect 1, Connect 2 and Connect 3. When an 
   application on the terminal starts to connect with the networks, the 
   system selects the connection handle and configures parameters (e.g., 
   SSID, default Proxy, APN parameter) based on the specific requirement 
   of the application.

3.3. Interface and Access Node based connection handle 

   As illustrated in Figure 2, a UE have three network interfaces, i.e., 
   GRPS, WiFi and Bluetooth for network access. As for these interface, 
   each has more than one connection handles. Therefore, a connection 
   handle is determined by the network interface type and access 
   parameters. When an application starts to connect with the network, 
   it may implement based on local policy to select the appropriate 
   connection handle for this specific application.

4. Problems Encountered In Practice 

   As described in 3.2 and 3.3, a terminal may have multiple interfaces 
   and each interface may have multiple connection handles for different 
   access nodes. This section presents three implementation approaches 
   and the corresponding problems encountered. 

4.1. Pre-configuration of connection handle in UE 

   Currently, connection handle of the applications have been pre-
   configured on the OS. When UE connects to a network, it uses the pre-
   configured parameters automatically. 

   The problem is that the pre-configured parameters are different among 
   different vendors. Therefore, the applications should be designed 
   into different versions for the variant parameter settings. Moreover, 
   when an application is downloaded or updated, UE should check whether 

 
 
Zhang, Sun & Chen     Expires September 4, 2009               [Page 4] 

Internet-Draft  Connection Manager in Arena Platform        March 2009 
    

   the application is applicable. These increase the complexities and 
   restricts the development of UE applicaitons. 

4.2. Automatic selections based on OS 

   An application may rely on OS for the selection of a connection 
   handle which is one of the default connection handles maintained by 
   the OS. 

   The problem is that an OS may define one or several default 
   connection handles while, they may not suitable for all applications.  

4.3. Automatic selections based on  applications 

   All connection handles may be tried one by one by an application 
   until a connection is established. 

   The problem is this will cause a long time waiting and bad user 
   experience. Usually, successful connection may be identified in two 
   steps, i.e., network access success and service startup success. 
   Generally, one attempts to connect to a network may take about 3 
   second before time out. If every connect handle try 3 times, then it 
   may take about 9 second in all for network connection. After the link 
   is established, the application tries services according to 
   application layer protocol, such as registration etc. This may take 
   about 4-12 seconds before time out. Therefore, it takes about 7-21 
   second for an application getting connected with network. This will 
   not be a good experience for a user. 

5. Conclusions 

   The suggestions for standardization are summarized as follows. 

   o Manager for multiple interfaces to achieve better user experiences.       

   o The connection manager is implemented through both network side 
      and terminal side. 

   o Reduces the complexity of new application installation for diverse 
      terminals.
