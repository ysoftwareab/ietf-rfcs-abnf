Internet-Draft    Threat Analysis of the GEOPRIV Protocol   October 2002


1. Introduction

   The proliferation of location-based services that integrate tracking
   and navigation capabilities gives rise to significant privacy and
   security concerns.   Such services allow users to identify their own
   location as well as determine the location of others.  In certain
   peer-to-peer exchanges, device identification takes place
   automatically within a defined location perimeter, informing peer
   devices of a given user's identity and availability.  Additionally,
   records of location exchanges can reveal significant information
   about the habits, whereabouts, and associations of individual users.

   The GEOPRIV requirements allow the Location Object (LO) to support a
   wide variety of uses of Location Information (LI); the GEOPRIV object
   itself is intended to be technology-neutral, allowing a wide variety
   of devices to provide LI in the form of LO.  GEOPRIV also requires
   that many classes of Ultimate Location Recipients (ULRs) be capable
   of requesting LI from a Target (in some cases directly and in others
   through a Location Server).  The GEOPRIV requirements account for
   circumstances in which the Target has a contractual relationship with
   the entities that transmit and receive LI and those in which no
   contract exists.  Requiring the GEOPRIV object to support any
   technology, Target-ULR relationship, or underlying legal framework
   governing LI, complicates the protection of privacy and the security
   of LI.

   This document analyzes threats  to LI in transmission and storage.
   The actions possible due to the compromises of LI through these
   threats vary depending on the circumstances.  A server selling
   location information to potential marketers poses a distinct (and
   lower) risk from an outside individual intercepting a Target's
   present location to commit a physical attack.  It is important that
   these threats are considered as we work towards defining the LO.

   Some of the threats discussed in this document may be outside of the
   scope of the GEOPRIV charter, e.g., threats arising from failure to
   meet contractual obligations.  Nevertheless, a comprehensive
   discussion of threats is necessary to identify desirable security
   properties and counter-measures that will improve the security of the
   LO, and thereby better protect LI.

2. Habitat of the GEOPRIV Protocol

   The GEOPRIV architecture will be deployed in the open Internet - in a
   security environment in which potential attackers can inspect packets
   on the wire, spoof Internet addresses, and launch large-scale denial-
   of-service attacks.  In some architectures, portions of GEOPRIV
   traffic (especially traffic between the Location Sighter and an



Danley, et al.           Expires April 28, 2003                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft    Threat Analysis of the GEOPRIV Protocol   October 2002


   initial Location Server) may occur over managed networks that do not
   interface with the public Internet.

   The protocol itself assumes interaction between a number of logical
   roles, many of which will commonly be implemented in distributed
   network devices (for a full list of GEOPRIV roles and entities, see
   [1]).  The endpoints of the common GEOPRIV transactions are the
   Location Sighter (the source of location information from the
   perspective of the network) and the Ultimate Location Recipient (ULR)
   (the destination of data), which can be viewed as a special case of a
   Location Seeker.  Both a Location Sighter and a Location Seeker may
   have a relationship with a Location Server; the Location Sighter
   publishes data to a Location Server (which may provide a grooming/
   filtration function for location information), and the Location
   Seeker requests and receives information from the Location Server.
   This provides two points where GEOPRIV information could require
   protection across the wire.  Policies can also be provisioned in the
   Location Server by a Rule-Maker over the network; this provides
   another point where the architecture requires security.

   It is important to note that Location Sighters, and to a lesser
   degree Location Seekers, may be implemented on low-cost devices for
   which strong cryptographic security is currently prohibitively
   expensive computationally.

3. Motivations of Attackers of GEOPRIV

   The most obvious motivation for an attacker of GEOPRIV is to learn
   the location of a subject who wishes to keep their position private,
   or even for authorized Seekers to ascertain location information with
   a greater degree of precision than the Rule-Maker desires.  However,
   there are several other potential motivations that are causes for
   concern.  Attackers might also wish to prevent a target's location
   from being distributed, or to modify or corrupt location information
   in order to misrepresent the location of the target, or to redirect
   the target's location information to a third party that is not
   authorized to know this information.  Attackers may want to identify
   the associates of a target, or learn the habit or routines of a
   target.  Attackers might want to learn the identity of all of the
   parties that are in a certain location.  Finally, some attackers may
   simply want to halt the operation of the entire system through
   denial-of-service attacks.

   There is also a class of attackers who may be authorized as
   legitimate participants in a GEOPRIV protocol exchange but who abuse
   location information.  This includes the distribution or accumulation
   of location information outside the parameters of agreements between
   the principals, possibly for commercial purposes or as an act of

   unlawful surveillance.

4. Representative Attacks on GEOPRIV


4.1 Protocol Attacks


4.1.1 Eavesdropping and/or Interception

   Imagine a location-based computer game, based on traditional hide-
   and-seek, in which a centralized server provides hints as to the
   location of the 'hider' to a set of 'seekers'.  Seekers are given
   access to very coarse location data, whereas a single referee is
   given access to unfiltered and precise location information of the
   hider.  Each seeker has a wireless device (in the GEOPRIV
   architecture, a Location Seeker) that feeds them coarse positioning
   data from the Location Server.  The hider carries a device (a
   Location Sighter implemented by embedded GPS) that transmits location
   information to the Location Server.

   If one of the seekers wished to cheat by attacking the GEOPRIV
   protocol, there are a number of ways they could mount such an attack
   in order to learn the precise location of the hider.  They might
   eavesdrop on one of two network connections - either the connection
   between the Location Sighter and the Location Server, or the
   connection between the Location Server and the referee's Location
   Seeker (which receives precise information).  They might also attempt
   to impersonate the referee to the Location Server, in order to
   receive unfiltered Location Information.  Alternatively, they could
   impersonate the Location Server to the Location Sighter carried by
   the hider, which would also give them access to precise location
   information.  Finally, the cheater could attempt to act as the Rule-
   Maker, and to insert policies into the Location Server that would
   enable the cheater's Location Seeker access to uncoarsened location
   information.

   From these threats, we can derive a need for several security
   properties of the architecture.

   o  Confidentiality is required on both the connection between the
      Location Sighter and the Location Server, as well as the
      connection between the Location Server and any given Location
      Seeker.

   o  Location Servers must be capable of authenticating and authorizing
      Location Seekers to prevent impersonation.




Danley, et al.           Expires April 28, 2003                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft    Threat Analysis of the GEOPRIV Protocol   October 2002


   o  Similarly, Location Sighters must be capable of authenticating and
      authorizing Location Servers in order to prevent impersonation.

   o  Finally, the Location Server must be able to authenticate Rule-
      Makers, to make sure that unauthorized parties cannot change
      rules.


4.1.2 Identity Spoofing

   Consider a case in which the same boss employs two rivals.  One goes
   on a business trip to Cleveland.  Both rivals carry devices that are
   tracked by a Location Sighter (such as cell phones on which the cell
   carrier can triangulate), and both rivals allow their boss access to
   their (coarse) location information.  The rival that remained home
   wants to hack the GEOPRIV protocol to make it appear that the
   traveling rival is actually goofing off in South Beach rather than
   attending a dull technology conference in Cleveland.  How would such
   an attack be mounted?

   The attacker might attempt to spoof network traffic from the Location
   Sighter to the Location Server (especially if, through some other
   means such as a denial-of-service attack, the Location Sighter became
   unable to issue its own reports).  The goal of the attacker may be to
   provide falsified location information appropriate for someone in
   Miami, or perhaps even to replay a genuine location object from a
   previous visit of the rival to Miami.  The attacker might also try to
   spoof traffic from the Location Server to the boss' Location Seeker.

   From these threats we can derive a need for several security
   properties of the architecture.

   o  There is a need for the Location Server to authenticate Location
      Sighters.

   o  Location Seekers must be capable of authenticating Location
      Servers.

   o  Location information must be protected from replay attacks.

   Identity spoofing may create additional threats when the protocol is
   attacked.  In many circumstances, the identity of the Location
   Requester and the Location Recipient are the basis for controlling
   whether LI is revealed and, if so, how that LI is filtered.  If the
   identity of those entities is compromised, privacy is threatened.
   Anyone inside or outside the transaction that is capable of
   impersonating an authorized entity can gain access to confidential
   information, or initiate false transmissions in the authorized



Danley, et al.           Expires April 28, 2003                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft    Threat Analysis of the GEOPRIV Protocol   October 2002


   entity's name.  The ability to spoof the identity of the Location
   Recipient, for example, would create the risk of an unauthorized
   entity accessing both the identity and the location of the Target at
   the moment the LO was sent.

4.1.3 Information Gathering

   Eavesdropping and interception can also create traffic analysis
   threats as the interceptor collects more data over time.  Traffic
   analysis threats generally create the risk that an eavesdropper will
   be able to determine, from the very fact of the transmission, a
   relationship between the various entities involved.  If an employer
   requests to send the location of an employee to a customer, an
   eavesdropper could determine that three entities are somehow
   interacting with one another.  If eavesdropping continues over time,
   each interaction would involve the employer, employee, and several
   customers.  Such a log of information would reveal that the employer
   and employee frequently were associated with one another, and would
   reveal which clients more frequently dealt with the pair.  Thus, the
   traffic analysis threat creates the risk of eavesdroppers determining
   the Target's associates.

   Traffic analysis might also allow an eavesdropper to ascertain the
   identity or characteristics of targets in a particular location.  By
   observing transmissions between Location Sighters in a particular
   location and Location Servers (perhaps by eavesdropping on a wireless
   or wireline LAN scoped to the location in question), and then
   possibly following the data to various Location Recipients, an
   attacker may be able to learn the associates, including the employer,
   of targets in that location, and perhaps to extrapolate further
   identity information.

   If the eavesdropper is able to intercept not only the LO, but the LI
   itself, other threats are raised.  Let's return to the above example
   of the employer requesting an employee's location information.  In
   this instance, the interception of one such past transaction may
   reveal the identities and/or locations of all three parties involved,
   in addition to revealing the fact of their association.  In
   circumstances where there is a log of this data, however, analysis
   could reveal any regular route that the employee may travel in
   visiting customers, a general area that the employee works in, the
   identities and location of the employee's entire customer base, and
   information about how the entities relate.

   Threats based on traffic analysis are difficult to meet with protocol
   security measures, but they are important to note.

   From these threats we can derive a need for several security

   properties of the architecture.

   o  The Rule Maker must be able to define policies regarding the use
      of their LI.

   o  The connection between the Location Sighter and Location Server,
      as well as the connection between the Location Server and Location
      Seeker must remain confidential.

   o  Location Servers and Location Sighters must be capable of
      authenticating Location Seekers to prevent impersonation.

   o  Location Servers must be able to authenticate Rule Makers to
      ensure that unauthorized entities cannot change rules.


4.1.4 Denial of Service

   Parties who wish to deprive entire networks of GEOPRIV service,
   rather than just targeting particular users, would probably focus
   their efforts on the Location Server.  Since in many scenarios the
   Location Server plays the central role of managing access to location
   information for many devices, it is in such architectures a natural
   single point of failure.

   The GEOPRIV protocol appears to have some opportunities for
   amplification attacks.  When the Location Sighter reports
   information, the Location Server acts as an exploder, potentially
   delivering this information to numerous targets.  If the Location
   Sighter were to provide very rapid updates of position (as many as
   link speed could accommodate, especially in high-bandwidth wireless
   environments), then were the Location Server to proxy information to
   Seekers at a similar rate, this could become problematic when large
   numbers of Seekers are tracking the same user.

   Also note that most operations associated with the Location Server
   probably require cryptographic authentication.  Cryptographic
   operations entail a computational expense on the part of the Location
   Server.  This could provide an attractive means for attackers to
   flood the Location Server with dummied GEOPRIV information that is
   spoofed to appear to come from a Location Sighter, Location Seeker,
   or the Rule-Maker.  Because the Location Server has to expend
   resources to verify credentials presented by these GEOPRIV messages,
   floods of GEOPRIV information could have greater impact than denial-
   of-service attacks based on generic packet flooding.

4.2 Host Attacks

4.2.1 Data Stored at Servers

   LI maintained at a server is subject to many potential risks.  First,
   there may be accidental misuse of LI by the server.   Whether by
   negligence, carelessness, or lack of knowledge, the server may
   accidentally release LI to the wrong Location Recipients, or fail to
   properly filter the LI that is sent out.  Second, the server may
   intentionally misuse LI.  A server may decide to sell a "profile" it
   has compiled of a Target or Location Seeker despite provisions to the
   contrary in the Rule Maker's Policy.  Alternatively, an individual
   working for the server may, for personal gain, misuse access to the
   server to obtain LI.  Third, even with the most secure and trusted
   server, there is the risk that someone outside the system will hack
   into it in order to retrieve LI.  Last, there is always the potential
   that someone would use the legal system to subpoena an individual's
   records from a Server.  Such a process would likely result in the
   revelation of the Target's location information without notice to the
   Target or the Target's consent.

   Data stored at the server may reveal the Target's present location if
   the data is used or intercepted at or near the moment of
   transmission.  If a Target requests a map from their present location
   to a nearby store, and the server sends that information to the wrong
   Location Recipient, that Recipient could know the identity of the
   Target, the Target's current location, and the location where the
   Target might be headed.

   Data stored at the Location Server can also create many of the
   traffic analysis threats discussed in Section 4.1 above.  If access
   is gained not only to the fact of the LO transmission, but also to
   the LI transmitted, anyone with access to that information can put
   together a history of where that Target has been, for how long, and
   with whom.

4.2.2 Data Stored in Devices

   Because GEOPRIV is required to work with any given type of technology
   or Device, it is difficult to determine the particular threat
   potential of individual devices.  For example, any device that
   maintains a log of Location Requests sent, or LOs received, would
   pose a similar threat to the information maintained at a Location
   Server, discussed above.  A court subpoena or warrant for an
   individual's device could additionally reveal a similar log.

   Additionally, depending on the device, there is always the potential
   for data to be compromised in some way.  For a Device with a screen,



Danley, et al.           Expires April 28, 2003                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft    Threat Analysis of the GEOPRIV Protocol   October 2002


   there is always the potential that another individual will have the
   opportunity to view the Device display without the user's knowledge.
   A Device that provides verbal feedback (i.e.  to give directions to
   the blind) creates additional potential for LI to be compromised.  If
   the Target is sitting in a public place and requests directions from
   the Target's home to another location, anyone who can see the Device
   output may be able to determine the Target's identity, their
   residence, and possibly the location to which they are headed.

   In addition, if the device retained location information and the
   Device were lost or stolen, someone other than the Policy Maker could
   potentially access information regarding who LI was sent to and when,
   as well as potentially the location of the Target during each
   transaction.  Such information could enable an entity to determine
   significant private information based on who the owner of the Device
   has associated with in the past, as well as each location where the
   Target has been and for how long.

4.2.3 Data Stored with the Ultimate Location Recipient

   The threats posed here are similar to those discussed above in
   relation to Location Servers and Devices.  The main purpose of
   separating out threats posed by data stored at the ULR is to show
   that, depending on the complexity of the transaction and the other
   entities involved, data storage at various points in the transaction
   can bring rise to the same types of privacy risks.

4.2.4 Information Contained in Policies

   In many instances, the policies a Rule Maker creates will reveal
   information either about the Rule Maker or the Target.  A rule that
   degrades all information sent out by approximately 25 miles might
   tell an interceptor how to determine the Target's true location.  A
   policy that states, "Tell my boss what room I'm in when I'm in the
   building, but when I'm outside the building between 9 a.m.  and 5
   p.m.  tell him I'm in the building," would reveal a lot more
   information than most employees would desire.  Any boss who was the
   Location Seeker who received LI that specified "in the building"
   would then realize that the employee was elsewhere.

   In addition, if an entity had access to a log of data at the Location
   Server or at a Device, knowledge of the content of Policies would
   enable a sort of "decoding" of the location information of the device
   to something more accurate.  Thus, my boss could not only tell where
   I am at this minute, but could tell how many times over the last year
   I had been outside the building between 9 a.m.  and 5 p.m.

   The policies themselves may also reveal information about the Target.

Internet-Draft    Threat Analysis of the GEOPRIV Protocol   October 2002


   A rule such as the one above would clearly reveal the employment
   relationship between the two individuals as well as the fact that the
   employee was hiding something from the employer.

   In combination with other information the location information may
   enable the identification of the Target.

4.3 Usage Attacks


4.3.1 Threats Posed by Overcollection

   Weak or absent default privacy rules would also compromise LI.
   Without default policies for LOs, it is likely that a large number of
   Devices would reveal LI by default.  Privacy rules should control the
   collection, use, disclosure, and retention of Location Information.
   These rules must comply with fair information practices-these
   practices are further discussed in Section 5.1.

   While technically savvy Device users may create privacy rules to
   protect their LI, many individuals will lack the skill or motivation
   to do so.  Thus, left to their own devices many individuals would
   likely be left without privacy rules for their LI.  This in turn
   would leave these users' LI entirely vulnerable to various attacks.
   Default rules are necessary to address this problem.

   Without default rules, for example, a device might signal out to
   anyone nearby at regular intervals, respond to anyone nearby who
   queried it, or send signals out to unknown entities.

   The lack of a default rule of "Do not re-distribute," would allow the
   Location Server to pass the Target's location information on to
   others.  Lack of a default rule limiting the retention of LI could
   increase the risk posed by inappropriate use and access to stored
   data.

   While defining default privacy rules is beyond the scope of this
   document, default rules are necessary to limit the privacy risks
   posed by the use of services and devices using LI.

5. Countermeasures for Usage Violations

5.1 Fair Information Practices

   Principles of fair information practices require entities that handle
   personal information to meet certain obligations with respect to its
   collection, use, maintenance and security, and  give individuals
   whose personal information is collected certain due process-like



Danley, et al.           Expires April 28, 2003                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft    Threat Analysis of the GEOPRIV Protocol   October 2002


   rights in the handling of their information.  Fair information
   practices are designed to prevent specific threats posed by the
   collection of personal information about individuals.  For this
   reason, fair information practices are "countermeasures" that should
   be reflected in technical systems that handle personal information
   and the policies that govern their use.  A brief discussion of fair
   information practices may be beneficial in formulating requirements
   for the LO.

   There are seven main principles of fair information practices:

   1.  Openness: The existence of a record-keeping system for personal
       information must be known, along with a description of the main
       purpose and uses of the data.  Thus any entity that collects LI
       should inform individuals that this information is being
       collected and inform them about what the LI is being used for.
       Openness is designed to prevent the creation of secret systems.

   2.  Individual Participation: Individuals should have a right to view
       all information collected about them, and to be able to correct
       or remove data that is not timely, accurate, relevant, or
       complete.  The practice of individual participation acknowledges
       that sometimes information that is collected may be inaccurate or
       inappropriate.

   3.  Collection Limitation: Data should be collected by lawful and
       fair means and should be collected, where appropriate, with the
       knowledge or consent of the subject.  Data collection should be
       minimized to that which is necessary to support the transaction.
       Placing limits on collection helps protect individuals from the
       dangers of overcollection-both in terms of collecting too much
       information, or of collecting information for too long of a time
       period.

   4.  Data Quality: Personal data should be relevant to the purposes
       for which it is collected and used; personal information should
       be accurate, complete, and timely.  The requirement of data
       quality is designed to prevent particular kinds of harms that can
       flow from the use (appropriate or inappropriate) of personal
       information.

   5.  Finality: There should be limits to the use and disclosure of
       personal data: data should be used only for purposes specified at
       the time of collection; data should not be otherwise used or
       disclosed without the consent of the data subject or other legal
       authority.  A consumer who provides LI to a business in order to
       receive directions, for example, does not provide that
       information for any other purpose.  The business should then only



Danley, et al.           Expires April 28, 2003                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft    Threat Analysis of the GEOPRIV Protocol   October 2002


       use that LI to provide directions, and not for other purposes.

   6.  Security: Personal Data should be protected by reasonable
       security safeguards against such risks as loss, unauthorized
       access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.  While
       some security measures may take place outside of the LO-i.e.
       limiting employee access to Location Servers-other measures may
       be done through the LO or LO applications.

   7.  Accountability: Record keepers should be accountable for
       complying with fair information practices.  It will typically be
       easier for an individual to enforce these practices if they are
       explicitly written-either in the policies written by the Rule
       Maker, or in contracts between the individual and a trusted
       entity.


6. Security Properties of the GEOPRIV Protocol

   The countermeasures suggested below reflect the threats discussed in
   this document.  There is thus some overlap between the proposed
   security properties listed below, and the requirements in [1].

6.1 Policies as Counter-Measures

   The sections below are designed to illustrate that in many instances
   threats to LI can be limited through clear, unavoidable rules
   determined by Rule Makers.

6.1.1 Rule Maker Should Define Policies

   The Rule Maker for a given Device will generally be either the user
   of, or owner of, the device.  In certain circumstances, the Rule
   Maker may be both of these entities.  Depending on the device the
   Rule Maker may or may not be the individual most closely aligned with
   the Target.  For instance a child carrying a cell phone may be the
   Target, but the parent of that child would likely be the Rule Maker
   for the Device.  Giving the Rule Maker control is a potential
   opportunity to buttress the consent component of the collection
   limitation and finality principles discussed above.

6.1.2 GEOPRIV Should Have Default Policies

   Because some Rule Makers may not be informed about the role Policies
   play in the disclosure of their LI, GEOPRIV should include default
   policies.  The Rule Maker is, of course, always free to change his or
   her policies to provide more or less protection.  To protect privacy
   and physical safety, default policies should, at a minimum, limit



Danley, et al.           Expires April 28, 2003                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft    Threat Analysis of the GEOPRIV Protocol   October 2002


   disclosure and retention of LI..

   Default policies are also necessary for so-called "dumb" Location
   Sighters (LoSi).  If a LoSi is unable to determine the Policies set
   by the Rule Maker before passing the LO on to a Location Seeker, it
   is important that some default policies protect that LO in transit,
   and ensure that the LO is only sent to authorized Location Seekers.
   These default LoSi policies would help prevent many of the threats
   discussed in this document.  The Rule Maker should be able to
   determine the content of these default policies at any time.

6.1.3 Location Recipient Should Not Be Aware of All Policies

   An Ultimate Location Recipient should not be aware of the full
   policies defined by the Rule Maker.  The ULR will only need to be
   aware of those Policies it must obey-i.e.  those regarding its use
   and retention of the LI.  Other policies, such as those specifying
   the accuracy or filtering of the LI, or rules that do not cover the
   given interaction should not be revealed to the ULR.  This
   countermeasure is consistent with the minimization component of the
   collection limitation principle and ensures that the Rule Maker
   reveals only what he intends to.

6.1.4 Certain Policies Should Travel With the LO

   Security of LI at the device level is a bit complicated, as the Rule
   Maker has no real control over what is done with the LI once it
   arrives at the Device of the Location Seeker.  If certain Policies
   travel with the LO, the Rule Maker can encourage ULR compliance with
   its policies.  Potentially, a Policy could travel with the LO
   indicating when it was time to purge the data, preventing the
   compilation of a "log" of the Target's LI on any Device involved in
   the transmission of the LO.  Allowing policies to travel with the LO
   has the potential to limit the opportunity for traffic analysis
   attacks.

6.2 Protection of Identities

   Identities are an extremely important component of the LO.  While, in
   many instances, some form of identification of the Target, LS, and
   ULR will be necessary for authentication, there are various methods
   to separate these authentication "credentials" from the true identity
   of these devices.  These countermeasures are particularly useful in
   that compromise of a log of LI, no matter where the source, is less
   threatening to privacy when the Target's identity is stripped.

Internet-Draft    Threat Analysis of the GEOPRIV Protocol   October 2002


6.2.1 Short-Lived Identifiers May Protect Target's Identity

   Short-Lived identifiers would allow the using protocol to hide the
   true identity of the Rule Maker and the Target from Location Servers
   or Location Recipients.  These identifiers would still allow
   authentication, ensuring that only appropriate Location Recipients
   received the LO.  At the same time, however, making these identifiers
   short-lived helps prevent any association of a true identity of a
   Target with particular habits and associates.

6.2.2 Unlinked Pseudonyms May Protect the Location Recipients' Identity

   Unlinked pseudonyms would protect the identity of the Location
   Recipients in much the same manner as short-lived identifiers would
   protect the Target's identity.  When using both, any record that a
   Location Server had of a transaction would have two "credentials"
   associated with a LI transmission-one linked to the Target and one
   linked to the Location Recipient.  These credentials would allow the
   Location Server to authenticate the transmission without ever
   acquiring knowledge of the true identities of the individuals
   associated with each side of the transaction.

6.3 Security During Transmission of Data

   The attacks describe in this document motivate the following security
   properties for the connections between the Location Sighter and
   Location Server, the Location Server and Rule-Maker, and the Location
   Server and Location Seeker:

6.3.1 Policies May Disallow a Certain Frequency of Requests

   The Rule Maker might be able to set a policy that disallows a certain
   number of requests made within a specific period of time.  This type
   of arrangement would allow the Rule Maker to somewhat prevent the
   ability to average randomly coarsened data.  To an "untrusted"
   Location Recipient, for example, to whom the Rule Maker only wants to
   reveal LI that is coarsened to the level of a city, only one request
   might be honored every 2 hours.  This would prevent Location
   Recipients from sending repeated requests to gain more accurate
   presence information.

6.3.2 Mutual End-Point Authentication

   Authentication is crucial to the security of LI during transmission.
   The Location Server must be capable of authenticating Location
   Seekers to prevent impersonation.  Location Sighters must be capable
   of authenticating Location Servers to ensure that raw location
   information is not sent to improper entities.  Additionally, Location

Internet-Draft    Threat Analysis of the GEOPRIV Protocol   October 2002


   Servers must be able to authenticate Rule-Makers to ensure that
   unauthorized entities cannot change Policies.

6.3.3 Data Object Integrity & Confidentiality

   The LO must maintain integrity at all points of communication between
   Location Servers and Location Seekers.  Confidentiality is required
   on both the connection between the Location Sighter and the Location
   Server, as well as on the connection between the Location Server and
   any given Location Seeker.

6.3.4 Replay Protection

   Replay protection prevents an attacker from capturing a particular
   picee of location information and replaying it at a later time in
   order to convince ULRs of an erroneous location for the target.  Both
   Location Seekers and Location Servers, depending on their
   capabilities, may need replay protection.
