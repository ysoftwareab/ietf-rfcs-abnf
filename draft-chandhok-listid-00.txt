Abstract

    Software that handles electronic mailing list messages (servers
    and user agents) needs a way to reliably identify messages that
    belong to a particular mailing list.  With the advent of list
    headers [LISTSPEC] it has become even more important to provide
    an identifier to use to identify a mailing list regardless of
    the particular host that serves as the list processor at any
    given time.

    The List-Id header provides a standard location for such an
    identifier.  In addition, a namespace for list identifiers
    based on fully qualified domain names is described.  This
    namespace is intended to guarantee uniqueness for list owners
    who require it, while allowing for a less rigorous namespace
    for experimental and personal use.

    By including the List-Id field, list servers can make it easier
    for mail clients to provide automated tools for users to
    perform list functions.  The list identifier can serve as a key
    to make many automated processing tasks easier, and hence more
    widely available.

    The key words ''MUST'', ''MUST NOT'', ''REQUIRED'', ''SHALL'',
    ''SHALL NOT'', ''SHOULD'', ''SHOULD NOT'', ''RECOMMENDED'',
    ''MAY'', and ''OPTIONAL'' in this document are to be
    interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


1. Introduction

    Internet mailing lists have evolved into fairly sophisticated
    forums for group communication and collaboration; however,
    corresponding changes in the underlying infrastructure have
    lagged behind.  Recent proposals like [LISTSPEC] have expanded
    the functionality that the MUA can provide by providing more
    information in each message sent by the mailing list
    distribution software.

    In order to further automate (and make more accurate) the
    processing a software agent can do, there needs to be some
    unique identifier to use as an identifier for the mailing list.
    This identifier can be simply used for filter string matching,
    or it can be used in more sophisticated systems to uniquely
    identify messages as belonging to a particular mailing list
    independent of the particular host delivering the actual
    messages.  This identifier can also act as a key into a
    database of mailing lists.


2. The List Identifier Syntax

    The list identifer will, in most cases, appear like a host name
    in the domain of the owner's choosing.  In other words, the
    domain name system is being used to delegate namespace
    authority for list identifiers just as it has been used to
    distribute that authority for other internet resources.  If an
    entity is the owner of a domain or subdomain, then it may
    create list identifiers in the namespace of that domain.  It is
    important to note that it is perfectly acceptable for a list
    identifier to be completely independent of the domain name of
    the host machine servicing the mailing list.

    If the owner of the list does not have access and permission to
    a domain-based namespace, they MAY create unmanaged list
    identifiers in the special unmanaged domain "x".  This would
    apply to personal user, or users unable to afford domain name
    registration fees.  The owner of a mailing list MUST NOT
    generate list identifiers in any domain namespace for which
    they do not have administrative control or have prior approval.

    The syntax for a list identifier in ABNF [RFC2234] follows:

    list-id = #label "." list-id-namespace

    list-id-namespace = #domain-name | unmanaged-list-id-namespace

    unmanaged-list-id-namespace    = "x"

    Where:

    #label is a domain name label (limited to 63 characters), see
    [RFC2181]

    #domain-name is a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) [RFC2181]

    In addition, a list identifier MUST NOT be longer than 255
    octets in length, for future compatibility.

3. The List-Id Header Field

    This document presents a header field which will provide an
    identifier for an e-mail distribution list.  This header SHOULD
    be included on all messages distributed by the list (including
    command responses to individual users), and on other messages
    where the message clearly applies to this particular distinct
    list. There MUST be no more than one of each field present in
    any given message.

    This field MUST only be generated by mailing list software, not
    end users.

    The contents of the List-Id header mostly consist of
    angle-bracket ('<', '>') enclosed identifier, with internal
    whitespace being ignored. MTAs MUST NOT insert whitespace
    within the brackets, but client applications should treat any
    such whitespace, that might be inserted by poorly behaved MTAs,
    as characters to ignore.

    The list header fields are subject to the encoding and
    character restrictions for mail headers as described in
    [RFC822].

    The List-Id header may optionally include a description by
    including it as a "phrase" [DRUMS], usually before the
    angle-bracketed list identifier.  The MUA MAY choose to use
    this description in its user interface.

    The syntax of the List-Id header follows:

    list-id-header = "List-ID:" [FWS] [phrase] "<" list-id ">"
    [CFWS] CRLF

    where phrase, quoted-string, FWS, CFWS and CRLF are as defined
    in [DRUMS].

    Examples:

    List-Id: "List Header Mailing List" <list-header.nisto.com>
    List-Id: <commonspace-users.within.com>
    List-Id: "Lena's Personal Joke List" <lenas-jokes.0299.x>
    List-Id: "An internal CMU List" <0Jks9449.cmu.edu>
    List-Id: <0Jks9449384848xyzzy.0598.x>

4. Persistence of List Identifiers

    Although the list identifier MAY be changed by the mailing list
    administrator this is not desirable. (Note that there is no
    disadvantage to changing the description portion of the List-Id
    header.) A MUA MAY not recognize the change to the list
    identifier because the MUA SHOULD treat a different list
    identifier as a different list. As such the mailing list
    administrator SHOULD avoid changing the list identifier even
    when the host serving the list changes. On the other hand,
    transitioning from an informal unmanaged-list-id-namespace to a
    domain namespace is an acceptable reason to change the list
    identifier. Also if the focus of the list changes sufficiently
    the administrator may wish to retire the previous list and it's
    associated identifier to start a new list reflecting the new
    focus.

5. Uniqueness of List Identifiers

    This proposal seeks to leverage the existing administrative
    process already in place for domain name allocation.  In
    particular, we exploit the fact that domain name ownership
    creates a namespace that by definition can be used to create
    unique identifiers within the domain.

    In addition, there must be a mechanism for identification of
    mailing lists that are administrated by some entity without
    administrative access to a domain.  In this case, general
    heuristics can be given to reduce the chance of collision, but
    it cannot be guaranteed.  If a list owner requires a guarantee,
    they are free to register a domain name under their control.

    List-IDs not ending with ".x" MUST be globally unique in
    reference to all other mailing lists.

    List owners wishing to use the special "x" namespace for their
    list identifier SHOULD use the month and year (in the form
    MMYY) that they create the list identifier as a "subdomain" of
    the "x" domain.  In addition, some portion of the list
    identifier should be a randomly generated string.

    Thus, list identifiers such as <lenas-jokes.48585903.0299.x>
    and <0Jks9449384848xyzzy.0598.x> conform to these guidelines,
    while <lenas-jokes.0299.x> and <mylist.x> does not.   In fact,
    a particular list owner with several lists may choose to use
    the same random number subdomain when generating list
    identifiers for each of the lists.

    List-IDs ending with ".x" are not guaranteed to be globally
    unique.


6. Operations on List Identifiers

    There is only one operation defined for list identifiers, that
    of case insensitive equality (See Section 3.4.7.  CASE
    INDEPENDENCE [RFC822]).  The sole use of a list identifier is
    to identify a mailing list, and the sole use of the List-Id
    header is to mark a particular message as belonging to that
    list.  The comparison operation MUST ignore any part of the
    List-Id header outside of the angle brackets, the MUA MAY
    choose to inform the user if the descriptive name of a mailing
    list changes.

7. Supporting Nested Lists

    A list that is a sublist for another list in a nested mailing
    list hierarchy MUST NOT modify the List-Id header field.

8. Security Considerations

    There are very few new security concerns generated with this
    proposal. Message headers are an existing standard, designed to
    easily accommodate new types. There may be concern with headers
    being   forged, but this problem is inherent in Internet
    e-mail, not specific to the header described in this document.
    Further, the implications are relatively harmless.

    Mail list processors should not allow any user-originated
    List-Id fields to pass through to their lists, lest they
    confuse the user and have the potential to create security
    problems.

    On the client side, a forged list identifier may break
    automated processing.  The list identifier (in its current
    form) should never be used as an indication of the authenticity
    of the message.
