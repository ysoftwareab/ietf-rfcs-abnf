                      Aggressive use of NSEC/NSEC3
                 draft-ietf-dnsop-nsec-aggressiveuse-01

Abstract

   The DNS relies upon caching to scale; however, the cache lookup
   generally requires an exact match.  This document specifies the use
   of NSEC/NSEC3 resource records to generate negative answers within a
   range.  This increases resilience to DoS attacks, increases
   performance / decreases latency, decreases resource utilization on
   both authoritative and recursive servers, and also increases privacy.

   This document updates RFC4035 by allowing resolvers to generate
   negative answers based upon NSEC/NSEC3 records.

   1.  We say things like: "Currently the DNS does ..." - this will not
       be true after this is deployed, but I'm having a hard time
       rewording this.  "Without the techniques described in this
       document..." seems klunky.  Perhaps "historically?!"

1.  Introduction

   A DNS negative cache currently exists, and is used to cache the fact
   that a name does not exist.  This method of negative caching requires
   exact matching; this leads to unnecessary additional lookups, which
   have negative implications for DoS survivability, increases latency,
   leads to extra resource utilization on both authoritative and
   recursive servers, and decreases privacy by leaking queries.

   This document updates RFC 4035 to allow recursive resolvers to use
   NSEC/NSEC3 resource records to aggressively cache negative answers.
   This would allow such resolvers to respond with NXDOMAIN immediately
   if the name in question falls into a range expressed by a NSEC/NSEC3
   resource record already in the cache.

   Aggressive Negative Caching was first proposed in Section 6 of DNSSEC
   Lookaside Validation (DLV) [RFC5074] in order to find covering NSEC
   records efficiently.

   Section 3 of [I-D.vixie-dnsext-resimprove] "Stopping Downward Cache
   Search on NXDOMAIN" and [I-D.ietf-dnsop-nxdomain-cut] proposed
   another approach to use NXDOMAIN information effectively.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Many of the specialized terms used in this document are defined in
   DNS Terminology [RFC7719].

   The key words "Closest Encloser" and "Source of Synthesis" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in[RFC4592].

   "Closest Encloser" is also defined in NSEC3 [RFC5155], as is "Next
   closer name".

3.  Problem Statement

   The current DNS negative cache caches negative (non-existent)
   information, and requires an exact match in most instances [RFC2308].

Internet-Draft              NSEC/NSEC3 usage                 August 2016


   Assume that the (DNSSEC signed) "example.com" zone contains:

      apple.example.com IN A 192.0.2.1

      elephant.example.com IN A 192.0.2.2

      zebra.example.com IN A 192.0.2.3

   If a recursive resolver gets a query for cat.example.com, it will
   query the example.com authoritative servers and will get back an NSEC
   (or NSEC3) record starting that there are no records between apple
   and elephant.  The recursive resolver then knows that cat.example.com
   does not exist; however, it (currently) does not use the fact that
   the proof covers a range (apple to elephant) to suppress queries for
   other labels that fall within this range.  This means that if the
   recursive resolvers gets a query for ball.example.com (or
   dog.example.com) it will once again go off and query the example.com
   servers for these names.

   Apart from wasting bandwidth, this also wastes resources on the
   recursive server (it needs to keep state for outstanding queries),
   wastes resources on the authoritative server (it has to answer
   additional questions), increases latency (the end user has to wait
   longer than necessary to get back an NXDOMAIN answer), can be used by
   attackers to cause a DoS (see additional resources), and also has
   privacy implications (e.g: typos leak out further than necessary).

4.  Background

   DNSSEC [RFC4035] and [RFC5155] both provide "authenticated denial of
   existence"; this is a cryptographic proof that the queried for name
   does not exist, accomplished by providing a (DNSSEC secured) record
   containing the names which appear alphabetically before and after the
   queried for name.  In the example above, if the (DNSSEC validating)
   recursive server were to query for lion.example.com it would receive
   a (signed) NSEC/NSEC3 record stating that there are no labels between
   "elephant" and "zebra".  This is a signed, cryptographic proof that
   these names are the ones before and after the queried for label.  As
   lion.example.com falls within this range, the recursive server knows
   that lion.example.com really does not exist.  This document specifies
   that this NSEC/NSEC3 record should be used to generate negative
   answers for any queries that the recursive server receives that fall
   within the range covered by the record (for the TTL for the record).

   [RFC4035]; Section 4.5 states:

   For a zone signed with NSEC, it would be possible to use the
   information carried in NSEC resource records to indicate the non-



Fujiwara, et al.        Expires February 3, 2017                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft              NSEC/NSEC3 usage                 August 2016


   existence of a range of names.  However, such use is discouraged by
   Section 4.5 of RFC4035.  It is recommended that readers read RFC4035
   in its entirety for a better understanding.  At the root of the
   concern is that new records could have been added to the zone during
   the TTL of the NSEC record, and that generating negative responses
   from the NSEC record would hide these.  We believe this
   recommendation can be relaxed because lookups for the specific name
   could have come in during the normal negative cache time and so
   operators should have no expectation that an added name would work
   immediately.  We think that the TTL of the NSEC record is the
   authoritative statement of how quickly a name can start working
   within a zone.

5.  Proposed Solution

5.1.  Aggressive Negative Caching

   Section 4.5 of [RFC4035] shows that "In theory, a resolver could use
   wildcards or NSEC RRs to generate positive and negative responses
   (respectively) until the TTL or signatures on the records in question
   expire.  However, it seems prudent for resolvers to avoid blocking
   new authoritative data or synthesizing new data on their own.
   Resolvers that follow this recommendation will have a more consistent
   view of the namespace".

   This document relaxes this this restriction, as follows:

   +--------------------------------------------------------------+
   |  Once the records are validated, DNSSEC enabled full-service |
   |  resolvers MAY use NSEC/NSEC3 resource records to generate   |
   |  negative responses until their effective TTLs or signatures |
   |  for those records expire.                                   |
   +--------------------------------------------------------------+

   If the full-service resolver's cache has sufficient information to
   validate the query, the full-service resolver MAY use NSEC/NSEC3/
   wildcard records aggressively.  Otherwise, the full-service resolver
   MUST fall back to send the query to the authoritative DNS servers.

   If the query name has the matching NSEC/NSEC3 RR proving the
   information requested does not exist, the full-service resolver may
   respond with a NODATA (empty) answer.

5.2.  NSEC

   If a full-service resolver implementation supports aggressive
   negative caching, then it SHOULD support aggressive use of NSEC and
   enable it by default.  It SHOULD provide a configuration switch to



Fujiwara, et al.        Expires February 3, 2017                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft              NSEC/NSEC3 usage                 August 2016


   disable aggressive use of NSEC and allow it to be enabled or disabled
   for specific zones.

   The validating resolver needs to check the existence of an NSEC RR
   matching/covering the source of synthesis and an NSEC RR covering the
   query name.

   If the full-service resolver's cache contains an NSEC RR covering the
   source of synthesis and the covering NSEC RR of the query name, the
   full-service resolver may respond with NXDOMAIN error immediately.

5.3.  NSEC3

   NSEC3 aggressive negative caching is more difficult.  If the zone is
   signed with NSEC3, the validating resolver needs to check the
   existence of non-terminals and wildcards which derive from query
   names.

   If the full-service resolver's cache contains an NSEC3 RR matching
   the closest encloser, an NSEC3 RR covering the next closer name, and
   an NSEC3 RR covering the source of synthesis, it is possible for the
   full-service resolver to respond with NXDOMAIN immediately.

   If a covering NSEC3 RR has Opt-Out flag, the covering NSEC3 RR does
   not prove the non-existence of the domain name and the aggressive
   negative caching is not possible for the domain name.

   A full-service resolver implementation MAY support aggressive use of
   NSEC3.  If it does aggressive use of NSEC3, it SHOULD provide a
   configuration switch to disable aggressive use of NSEC3 and allow it
   to be enabled or disabled for specific zones.

5.4.  Wildcard

   The last paragraph of RFC 4035 Section 4.5 discusses aggressive use
   of a cached deduced wildcard (as well as aggressive use of NSEC) and
   recommends that it is not relied upon.

   Just like the case for the aggressive use of NSEC discussed in this
   draft, we revise this recommendation.  As long as the full-service
   resolver knows a name would not exist without the wildcard match, it
   can answer a query for that name using the cached deduced wildcard,
   and it may be justified for performance and other benefits.  (Note
   that, so far, this is orthogonal to "when aggressive use (of NSEC) is
   enabled").

   Furthermore, when aggressive use of NSEC is enabled, the aggressive
   use of cached deduced wildcard will be more effective.

Internet-Draft              NSEC/NSEC3 usage                 August 2016


   A full-service resolver implementation MAY support aggressive use of
   wildcards.  It SHOULD provide a configuration switch to disable
   aggressive use of wildcards.

5.5.  Consideration on TTL

   The TTL value of negative information is especially important,
   because newly added domain names cannot be used while the negative
   information is effective.  Section 5 of RFC 2308 states that the
   maximum number of negative cache TTL value is 3 hours (10800).  It is
   RECOMMENDED that full-service resolvers limit the maximum effective
   TTL value of negative responses (NSEC/NSEC3 RRs) to this same value.

6.  Update to RFC 4035

   Section 4.5 of [RFC4035] shows that "In theory, a resolver could use
   wildcards or NSEC RRs to generate positive and negative responses
   (respectively) until the TTL or signatures on the records in question
   expire.  However, it seems prudent for resolvers to avoid blocking
   new authoritative data or synthesizing new data on their own.
   Resolvers that follow this recommendation will have a more consistent
   view of the namespace".

   (If approved, ) The paragraph is updated as follows:

   +--------------------------------------------------------------+
   |  Once the records are validated, DNSSEC enabled full-service |
   |  resolvers MAY use wildcards and NSEC/NSEC3 resource records |
   |  to generate (positive and) negative responses until their   |
   |  effective TTLs or signatures for those records expire.      |
   +--------------------------------------------------------------+

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

8.  Security Considerations

   Newly registered resource records may not be used immediately.
   However, choosing suitable TTL value and negative cache TTL value
   (SOA MINIMUM field) will mitigate the delay concern, and it is not a
   security problem.

   It is also suggested to limit the maximum TTL value of NSEC / NSEC3
   resource records in the negative cache to, for example, 10800 seconds
   (3hrs), to mitigate this issue.  Implementations which comply with
   this proposal are recommended to have a configurable maximum value of
   NSEC RRs in the negative cache.

Internet-Draft              NSEC/NSEC3 usage                 August 2016


   Aggressive use of NSEC / NSEC3 resource records without DNSSEC
   validation may cause security problems.  It is highly recommended to
   apply DNSSEC validation.

   The author implemented NSEC aggressive caching using Unbound and its
   DLV validator code.

Appendix A.  Detailed implementation idea

   o  Previously, cached negative responses were indexed by QNAME,
      QCLASS, QTYPE, and the setting of the CD bit (see RFC 4035,
      Section 4.7), and only queries matching the index key would be
      answered from the cache.  With aggressive negative caching, the
      validator, in addition to checking to see if the answer is in its
      cache before sending a query, checks to see whether any cached and
      validated NSEC record denies the existence of the sought
      record(s).  Using aggressive negative caching, a validator will
      not make queries for any name covered by a cached and validated
      NSEC record.  Furthermore, a validator answering queries from
      clients will synthesize a negative answer whenever it has an
      applicable validated NSEC in its cache unless the CD bit was set
      on the incoming query.  (Imported from Section 6 of [RFC5074]).

   o  Implementing aggressive negative caching suggests that a validator
      will need to build an ordered data structure of NSEC and NSEC3
      records for each signer domain name of NSEC / NSEC3 records in
      order to efficiently find covering NSEC / NSEC3 records.  Call the
      table as NSEC_TABLE.  (Imported from Section 6.1 of [RFC5074] and
      expanded.)

   o  The aggressive negative caching may be inserted at the cache
      lookup part of the full-service resolvers.

   o  If errors happen in aggressive negative caching algorithm,
      resolvers MUST fall back to resolve the query as usual.  "Resolve
      the query as usual" means that the full-resolver resolve the query
      in Recursive-mode as if the full-service resolver does not
      implement aggressive negative caching.

Appendix B.  Side effect: mitigation of random subdomain attacks

   Random sub-domain attacks (referred to as "Water Torture" attacks or
   NXDomain attacks) send many queries for non-existent information to
   full-service resolvers.  Their query names consist of random prefixes
   and a target domain name.  The negative cache does not work well, and
   thus targeted full-service resolvers end up sending queries to
   authoritative DNS servers of the target domain name.

   The aggressive negative caching is one of possible countermeasures to
   random subdomain attacks.  If the full-service resolver supports
   aggressive negative caching and the target domain name is signed with
   NSEC/NSEC3 (without Opt-Out), the aggressive negative caching is one
   of countermeasures of random subdomain attacks.

   However, attackers can set the CD bit to their attack queries.  The
   CD bit disables signature validation and the aggressive negative
   caching will be of no use.
