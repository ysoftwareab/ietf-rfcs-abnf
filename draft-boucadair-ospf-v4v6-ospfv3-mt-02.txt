      Multi-Topology/Multi-Instance OSPFv3 for IPv4-Embedded IPv6
                 draft-boucadair-ospf-v4v6-ospfv3-mt-02

Abstract

   This memo defines two new Multi Topology Routing Identifiers (MT
   IDs), based on [I-D.ietf-ospf-mt-ospfv3] and two new Instance
   Identifiers (MI IDs), based on [I-D.ietf-ospf-af-alt], respectively,
   in OSPFv3.  With these identifiers, an IPv4-Embedded IPv6 topology is
   maintained for both IPv6 unicast and multicast traffic.  The purpose
   of running separate instances or topologies for IPv4- Embedded IPv6
   traffic is to distinguish from the native IPv6 routing topology, and
   the topology that is used for routing IPv4-Embedded IPv6 datagrams
   only.  Separate instances/topologies are also meant to prevent any
   overload of the native IPv6 routing tables by IPv4-Embedded IPv6
   routes.

Internet-Draft       IPv4-Embedded Pv6 MT/MI-OSPFv3        February 2010


1.  Introduction

   Within the double context of public IPv4 address exhaustion and IPv6-
   IPv4 interconnection, numerous solutions are being elaborated within
   IETF.  Both translation (e.g., [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful]
   and [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate]) and encapsulation (e.g.,
   [I-D.boucadair-dslite-interco-v4v6] and
   [I-D.boucadair-behave-ipv6-portrange]) based schemes are proposed to
   allow IPv6-IPv4 interconnection.  These solutions require the
   injection of routes to IPv4-Embedded IPv6 prefixes
   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] in intra-domain routing protocols .

   In order to prevent any overload of the native IPv6 routing table
   with IPv4-Embedded IPv6 routes, this document defines new MT IDs
   (resp., MI IDs) which are required for the activation of multiple
   topologies (resp., Instances), where the native IPv6 topology (resp.,
   Instance) would be distinct from the IPv4-Embedded IPv6 topology
   (resp., Instance).  Operational reasons also motivate this approach
   which is meant to ease the migration to full IPv6.  As a result, the
   unicast IPv4- Embedded IPv6 topology (resp., Instance) is used for
   unicast IPv4- Embedded IPv6 route computation purposes, and the
   multicast IPv4- Embedded IPv6 topology (resp., Instance) is used for
   multicast IPv4- Embedded IPv6 route computation purposes.

   This document does not make any preference between the solution
   described in [I-D.ietf-ospf-mt-ospfv3] and [I-D.ietf-ospf-af-alt].
   Network administrators have to make their decisions based on local
   policies.  If the multi-instance mechanism is deployed in an OSPFv3
   network as a preference for multiple topologies, the MI extensions
   defined in this document may be used to support unicast/multicast
   IPv4-Embedded IPv6 routing.  If MT-OSPFv3 mechanism is deployed in an
   OSPFv3 network as a preference for multiple topologies, the MT
   extensions defined in this document may be used to support unicast/
   multicast IPv4-Embedded IPv6 routing.


2.  IPv4-Embedded IPv6 OSPFv3 Topologies

   MT-OSPFv3 [I-D.ietf-ospf-mt-ospfv3] is a mechanism that has been
   specified to run various topologies based on several criteria such as
   the need to distinguish the IPv6 unicast topology from the IPv4
   routing topology.  Distinct MT IDs (Multi-Topology Identifiers) are
   assigned by IANA (e.g., MT ID# 0 for IPv6 routing topology, MT ID# 3
   for IPv6 multicast topology, etc.).  MT ID #5-#31 range is reserved
   for IETF consensus.  This document requests the assignment of two new
   MT IDs for the following usages:

   o  IPv4-Embedded IPv6 unicast topology;

   o  IPv4-Embedded IPv6 multicast topology.


3.  IPv4-Embedded IPv6 OSPFv3 Instances

   [I-D.ietf-ospf-af-alt] specifies a mechanism to map each address
   family (AF) to a separate OSPFv3 [RFC5340] Instance identified by an
   ID.  Many Instance IDs have been reserved for different AF (e.g.,
   Instance ID#0 - #31 for IPv6 unicast AF, Instance ID#32 - #63 for
   IPv6 multicast AF, etc.).  Instance ID#0 is used by default for IPv6
   unicast AF.  This document requests the assignment of two new
   Instance IDs for the IPv4-Embedded IPv6 AF:

   o  IPv4-Embedded IPv6 unicast AF;

   o  IPv4-Embedded IPv6 multicast AF.


4.  Provisioning

   Adequate provisioning must be done according to
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-mt-ospfv3] and [I-D.ietf-ospf-af-alt], respectively,
   based on the corresponding mechanism that is actually used in an
   OSPFv3 network, in order to have a fully-connected IPv4-Embedded IPv6
   unicast or multicast topology.


5.  Procedure

   This document does not require any modification to the procedure
   specified in [I-D.ietf-ospf-mt-ospfv3] nor in [I-D.ietf-ospf-af-alt].
   Nevertheless, routes to IPv4-Embedded IPv6 addresses or prefixes MUST
   be instantiated within an IPv4-Embedded IPv6 MT-OSPFv3 (resp., MI-
   OSPFv3).  Concretely, the IANA prefix defined in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] MUST be supported by default.
   Service providers MAY also choose a LIR prefix to build the IPv4-
   Embedded IPv6 addresses.


6.  Advertising IPv4-Embedded IPv6 Routes

   With one of the mechanisms (i.e., a separate OSPFv3 instance or a
   separate OSPFv3 topology) as described above, reachability of IPv4-
   Embedded IPv6 destinations can be advertised in an IPv6 network using
   OSPFv3.

Internet-Draft       IPv4-Embedded Pv6 MT/MI-OSPFv3        February 2010


   In general, IPv4-Embedded IPv6 addresses and prefixes are advertised
   into an OSPFv3 network using AS External LSA [RFC5340], i.e.- with
   the advertising scope throughout the entire Autonomous System.  This
   is because an advertising node in this case is most likely connected
   to one or more IPv4 networks, and as such, it functions as an
   Autonomous System Boundary Router (ASBR) in the perspective of OSPFv3
   routing domain.  Any OSPFv3 area that does not want to receive such
   advertisement can be configured as a stub area or with other routing
   policy.

   By default, the metric in an AS External LSA that carries one or more
   IPv4-Embedded IPv6 addresses and prefixes is a Type 1 external
   metric, which is then to be added to the metric of an intra-AS path
   during OSPFv3 routes calculation.  By configuration on an ASBR, the
   metric can be set to a Type 2 external metric, which is considered
   much larger than any intra-AS path.  The detail is referred to OSPFv3
   specification [RFC5340].  In either case, an external metric may be
   exact the same unit as in an IPv4 network (running OSPFv2 or others),
   but may also be specified by a routing policy, the detail is outside
   of the scope of this document.

   Advertising IPv4-Embedded IPv6 addresses and prefixes using OSPFv3
   inter-area prefix LSA is for future study.


7.  Forwarding

   Only incoming datagrams destined to IPv4-Embedded IPv6 addresses are
   associated (and forwarded accordingly) with the IPv4-Embedded IPv6
   unicast/multicast topology, respectively.  WKP (i.e., 64:FF9B::/96)
   and/or LIR prefix defined in [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format] MUST be
   configured in all participating nodes.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the following MT-OSPFv3 IDs:

   o  MT ID# for IPv4-Embedded IPv6 unicast topology

   o  MT ID# for IPv4-Embedded IPv6 multicast topology.

   and the following OSPFv3 Instance IDs:

   o  Instance ID# for IPv4-Embedded IPv6 unicast AF;

   o  Instance ID# for IPv4-Embedded IPv6 multicast AF.

9.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any security issue in addition to
   those defined in [RFC5340].
