1.  Introduction

   The Network Service Header (NSH), defined in [I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh], is
   an encapsulation header that is used in Service Function Chains
   (SFC).

   The NSH specification [I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh] supports two possible
   methods of including metadata in the NSH; MD Type 0x1 and MD Type
   0x2.  When using MD Type 0x1 the NSH includes 16 octets of Context
   Header fields.  The current memo proposes an allocation for the MD
   Type 0x1 Context Headers, which incorporates the ingress timestamp of
   the packet, a sequence number, and a source interface identifier.

   In a nutshell, packets that enter the SFC-Enabled Domain are
   timestamped.  The ingress timestamp is measured by the Classifier
   [RFC7665], and incorporated in the NSH.  The ingress timestamp may be
   used for various different purposes, including delay measurement,
   packet marking for passive performance monitoring, and timestamp-
   based policies.  Notably, the timestamp does not increase the packet
   length, since it is incorporated in the MD Type 0x1 Mandatory Context
   Headers.

   The source interface identifier indicates the interface through which
   the packet was received at the classifier.  This identifer may
   specify a physical or a virtual interface.  The sequence numbers can
   be used by Service Functions (SFs) to detect out-of-order delivery or

   duplicate transmissions.  The sequence number is maintained on a per-
   source-interface basis.

   KPI-stamping [I-D.browne-sfc-nsh-kpi-stamp] defines an NSH
   timestamping mechanism that uses the MD Type 0x2 format.  The current
   memo defines a compact MD Type 0x1 Context Header that does not
   require the packet to be extended beyond the NSH header.
   Furthermore, the two timestamping mechanisms can be used in concert,
   as further discussed below.

   The NSH Timestamp Allocation includes the following fields:

   o  Sequence Number - a 32-bit sequence number.  The sequence number
      is maintained on a per-source-interface basis.  The sequence
      numbers can be used by SFs to detect out-of-order delivery, or
      duplicate transmissions.

   o  Source Interface - a 32-bit source interface identifier that is
      assigned by the Classifier.

   o  Ingress Timestamp - this field is 8 octets long, and specifies the
      time at which the packet was received by the Classifier.  The
      format of this field uses the 64 least significant bits of the
      IEEE 1588-2008 Precision Time Protocol format [IEEE1588].  This
      truncated format consists of a 32-bit seconds field followed by a
      32-bit nanoseconds field.  As defined in [IEEE1588], the timestamp
      specifies the number of seconds elapsed since 1 January 1970
      00:00:00 according to the International Atomic Time (TAI).

4.  Ingress Timestamping Use Cases

4.1.  Network Analytics

   Per-packet timestamping enables coarse-grained monitoring of the
   network delay along the Service Function Chain.  Once a potential
   problem or bottleneck is detected, for example when the delay exceeds
   a certain policy, a highly-granular hop-by-hop monitoring mechanism,
   such as [I-D.browne-sfc-nsh-kpi-stamp] or
   [I-D.brockners-inband-oam-data], can be triggered, allowing to
   analyze and localize the problem.

   Timestamping is also useful for logging and for flow analytics.  It
   is often useful to maintain the timestamp of the first and last
   packet of the flow.  Furthermore, traffic mirroring and sampling
   often requires a timestamp to be attached to analyzed packets.
   Attaching the ingress timestamp to the NSH Context Header provides an

Internet-Draft            NSH Ingress Timestamp             January 2017


   in-band common time reference that can be used for various network
   analytics applications.

4.2.  Alternate Marking

   A possible approach for passive performance monitoring is to use an
   alternate marking method [I-D.ietf-ippm-alt-mark].  This method
   requires data packets to carry a field that marks (colors) the
   traffic, and enables passive measurement of packet loss, delay, and
   delay variation.  The value of this marking field is periodically
   toggled between two values.

   When the ingress timestamp is incorporated in the NSH Context Header,
   it can natively be used for alternate marking.  For example, the
   least significant bit of the timestamp Seconds field can be used for
   this purpose, since the value of this bit is inherently toggled every
   second.

4.3.  Consistent Updates

   The timestamp can be used for taking policy decisions such as
   'Perform action A if timestamp>=T_0'.  This can be used for enforcing
   time-of-day policies or periodic policies in service functions.
   Furthermore, timestamp-based policies can be used for enforcing
   consistent network updates, as discussed in [DPT].

5.  Synchronization Considerations

   Some of the applications that make use of the ingress timestamp
   require the Classifer and SFs to be synchronized to a common time
   reference, for example using the Network Time Protocol [RFC5905], or
   the Precision Time Protocol [IEEE1588].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of NSH in general are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh].  The security considerations of in-band
   timestamping in the context of NSH is discussed in
   [I-D.browne-sfc-nsh-kpi-stamp], and the current section is based on
   that discussion.

   The use of in-band timestamping, as defined in this document, can be
   used as a means for network reconnaissance.  By passively
   eavesdropping to timestamped traffic, an attacker can gather

Internet-Draft            NSH Ingress Timestamp             January 2017


   information about network delays and performance bottlenecks.  A man-
   in-the-middle attacker can maliciously modify timestamps in order to
   attack applications that use the timestamp values, such as
   performance monitoring applications.

   Since the timestamping mechanism relies on an underlying time
   synchronization protocol, by attacking the time protocol an attack
   can potentially compromise the integrity of the NSH timestamp.  A
   detailed discussion about the threats against time protocols and how
   to mitigate them is presented in [RFC7384].
