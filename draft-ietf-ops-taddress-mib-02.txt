Abstract

   This document introduces a MIB module which defines textual
   conventions to represent commonly used transport layer addressing
   information.  The definitions are compatible with the concept of
   TAddress/TDomain pairs introduced by the SMIv2 and support the
   Internet transport protocols over IPv4 and IPv6.

1. Introduction

   Several MIB modules need to represent transport layer addresses in a
   generic way.  Typical examples are MIBs for application protocols
   that can run over several different transports or application
   management MIBs that need to model generic communication endpoints.

   The SMIv2 defines in RFC 2579 [7] the textual conventions TDomain and
   TAddress to represent generic transports layer endpoints.  A generic
   TAddress value is interpreted in a given transport domain which is
   identified by a TDomain value.  The TDomain is an object identifier
   which allows MIB authors to extend the set of supported transport
   domains by providing suitable definitions in standardized or
   enterprise specific MIB modules.

   An initial set of TDomain values and concrete TAddress formats has
   been standardized in RFC 1906 [11].  These definitions are however
   mixed up with SNMP semantics.  Furthermore, definitions for Internet
   transport protocols over IPv4 and IPv6 are missing.

   The purpose of this memo is to introduce a set of well-known textual
   conventions to represent commonly used transport layer addressing
   information which is compatible with the original TDomain and
   TAddress approach and which includes definitions for additional
   Internet transport protocols over IPv4 and IPv6.  This memo also
   introduces a new textual convention which enumerates the well-known
   transport domains since such an enumeration provides in many cases
   sufficient flexibility and is more efficient compared to object
   identifiers.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT" and "MAY" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

2. SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [2].

   o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
      purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD
      16, RFC 1155 [3], STD 16, RFC 1212 [4] and RFC 1215 [5].  The
      second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578
      [6], STD 58, RFC 2579 [7] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [8].

   o  Message protocols for transferring management information.  The

      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [9].  A second version of the SNMP
      message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
      protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [10] and RFC
      1906 [11].  The third version of the message protocol is called
      SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [11], RFC 2572 [12] and RFC 2574
      [13].

   o  Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [9].  A second set of protocol
      operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
      [14].

   o  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [15] and
      the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
      [16].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [17].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

3. Overview

   This MIB module contains definitions for commonly used transport
   layer addressing information.  In particular, it provides the
   following definitions:

   1.  Textual conventions for generic transport addresses and generic
       transport domains.

   2.  Object identifier registrations for well-known transport domains.

   3.  An enumeration of the well-known transport domains, called a
       transport address type.

   4.  A set of textual conventions for the address formats used by
       well-known transport domains.  The DISPLAY-HINTs are aligned with
       the formats used in URIs [22], [23].

   It is expected that this MIB module will be updated by subsequent
   RFCs which register additional well-known transport domains and which
   introduce new textual conventions for the address formats used by
   those new transport domains.

   This module does NOT define the transport mappings of any particular
   protocol.  Rather, it defines a set of common identifiers and textual
   conventions that are intended to be used within various transport
   mappings documents.

3.1 Relationship to Other MIBs

   This section discusses how the definitions provided by this memo
   relate to definitions in related MIB modules.

3.1.1 SNMPv2-TC (TAddress, TDomain)

   The SNMPv2-TC module [7] defines the textual conventions TAddress and
   TDomain to represent generic transport addresses.

   A TAddress is an octet string with a size between 1 and 255 octets.
   Experience has shown that there is sometimes a need to represent
   unknown transport addresses.  This module therefore introduces a new
   textual convention TransportAddress which is an octet string with a
   size between 0 and 255 octets and otherwise identical semantics.  In
   other words, the sub-type TransportAddress (1..255) is identical with
   the TAddress defined in the SNMPv2-TC module [7].

   This module also introduces a new textual convention TransportDomain
   which is compatible with the TDomain definition so that a complete
   set of definitions is contained in a single module.

   New MIB modules SHOULD use the generic TransportDomain,
   TransportAddressType and TransportAddress definitions defined in this
   memo.  Existing MIB modules may be updated to use the definitions
   provided in this memo by replacing TDomain with TransportDomain and
   TAddress with TransportAddress (1..255).

3.1.2 SNMPv2-TM

   The transport domain values defined in the SNMPv2-TM module [11] all
   contain "snmp" as the prefix in their name and are registered under
   `snmpDomains' (from RFC 2578 [6]).  They were originally intended to
   describe SNMP transport domains only - but they were later also used



Daniele & Schoenwaelder    Expires September 17, 2002           [Page 5]

Internet-Draft         TCs for Transport Addresses            March 2002


   for non-SNMP transport endpoints.  These definitions are also
   incomplete since new transport address domains are needed to support
   (at least) SNMP over UDP over IPv6.

   The transport domain values defined in this memo are independent of
   the protocol running over the transport layer and SHOULD be used for
   all transport endpoints not carrying SNMP traffic.  Programs that
   interpret transport domain values should in addition accept the
   transport domain values defined in the SNMPv2-TM module in order to
   provide interoperability with existing implementations that use the
   SNMP specific transport domain values.

   Transport endpoints which carry SNMP traffic SHOULD continue to use
   the definitions from the SNMPv2-TM module where applicable.  They
   SHOULD use the transport domain values defined in this memo for SNMP
   transports not defined in the SNMPv2-TM module, such as SNMP over UDP
   over IPv6.  Programs that interpret transport domain values should in
   addition accept all the transport domain values defined in this memo
   in order to provide interoperability in cases where it is not
   possible or desirable to distinguish the protocols running over a
   transport endpoint.

3.1.3 INET-ADDRESS-MIB (InetAddressType, InetAddress)

   The INET-ADDRESS-MIB module [18] defines the textual conventions
   InetAddressType and InetAddress to represent Internet network layer
   endpoints.  Some MIB modules use these textual conventions in
   conjunction with the InetPortNumber textual convention to represent
   Internet transport layer endpoints.  This approach is fine as long as
   a MIB models protocols or applications that are specific to the
   Internet suite of transport protocols.  For protocols or applications
   that can potentially use other transport protocols, the use of the
   definitions contained in this memo is more appropriate.

       DESCRIPTION
           "Denotes a generic transport address.

            A TransportAddress value is always interpreted within the
            context of a TransportAddressType or TransportDomain value.
            Every usage of the TransportAddress textual convention is
            required to specify the TransportAddressType or
            TransportDomain object which provides the context. It is
            suggested that the TransportAddressType or TransportDomain is
            logically registered before the object(s) which use the
            TransportAddress textual convention if they appear in the
            same logical row.

            The value of a TransportAddress object must always be
            consistent with the value of the associated
            TransportAddressType or TransportDomain object. Attempts
            to set a TransportAddress object to a value which is
            inconsistent with the associated TransportAddressType or
            TransportDomain must fail with an inconsistentValue error.

6. Security Considerations

   The MIB module contained in this memo does not define any management
   objects.  Instead, it defines a set of textual conventions which may
   be used by other MIB modules to define management objects.

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written for MIB
   modules that define concrete management objects.  This document has
   therefore no impact on the security of the Internet.

7. Acknowledgments

   This document was produced by the Operations and Management Area
   "IPv6MIB" design team.  Some of the definitions in this module are
   taken from RFC 1906 [11].  The authors would like to thank Mark
   Ellison, Brian Haberman, Erik Nordmark, Bill Strahm and Dave Thaler
   for their comments and suggestions.

8. Intellectual Property Notice

   intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to
