1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing ([RFC8402]) leverages the mechanism of source
   routing.  An ingress node steers a packet through an ordered list of
   instructions, called "segments".  Each one of these instructions
   represents a function to be implemented at a specific location in the
   network.  A function is locally defined on the node where it is
   executed.  Network Programming combines Segment Routing functions to
   achieve a networking objective that goes beyond mere packet routing.
   [RFC8986] defines the SRv6 Network Programming concept and specifies
   the main Segment Routing behaviors and network programming functions.

   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) [RFC8279] is an architecture
   that provides optimal multicast forwarding without requiring a
   protocol for explicitly building multicast distribution trees or per-
   flow state maintained by intermediate routers.  When a multicast data
   packet enters BIER forwarding domain, the ingress node encapsulates
   the packet with a bitstring, each bitposition of which presents the
   egress nodes.  To forward the packet to a given set of egress nodes,
   the bits corresponding to those egress nodes are set in the
   bitstring.  The intermediate nodes in the BIER domain replicate and
   forward the packet based on the bitstring.The mechanism of forwarding
   a packet based on bitstring of BIER are specified in [RFC8279].

   An IPv6 based multicast source routing (MSR6) solution is defined in
   [I-D.cheng-spring-ipv6-msr-design-consideration], which leverages the
   benefits of source routing over IPv6 data plane to provide simplified
   multicast TE and BE service in an IPv6 network without unnecessary
   multicast tree status and complex control plane protocols.  MSR6
   needs to reuse the advantages of SRv6 and BIER to implement source
   routing.

   MSR6 has two basic modes of forwarding: one is based on Shortest Path
   First(SPF), which is called MSR6 BE mode; the other is based on
   traffic engineered, which is called MSR6 TE mode.  This document
   defines 2 new types of segment: End.RL and End.RL.X , and the
   corresponding packet processing procedures over the IPv6 data plane
   for the MSR6 TE solutions.

2.  Terminologies

   MSR6: Multicast Source Routing over IPv6, defined in
   [I-D.cheng-spring-ipv6-msr-design-consideration].

   MRH: Multicast Routing Header, a new type of Routing Header which is
   used for MSR6.

   Multicast domain: A set of network device which could provide P2MP
   multicast transport.  In this document, the multicast domain is an
   MSR domain, where every nodes support the capability of MSR6.

   Root Node: Root node is the beginning point of a multicast tree and
   also the initiation node of a multicast tunnel.  It encapsulates the
   packet with a multicast header.  The type of the encapsulation
   depends on the routing protocol used in the multicast domain.  For
   MSR6 TE, the encapsulation is MSR6 TE header, which is an IPv6 header
   with MRH.

   Replication Endpoint: the intermediate node of a multicast tree,
   which replicates packet and forwards the packet to the downstream
   nodes.  For MSR6, the Replication Node is called Replication Endpoint
   which can be indicated by the MSR6 Segment and replicate packets
   according to the multicast source routing information encapsulation
   in the MSR6 header of the packet.

   Leaf Node: Leaf node is the end point of a multicast tree and also
   the decapsulation node of a multicast tunnel.  It decapsulates the
   multicast header in the packet and forwards the packet based on
   overlay encapsulation.

   Parent Node: The parent node is the node that does the packet
   replication, corresponding to the concept of a child node.

   Child Node: The child node is the downstream node that will receive
   the packet which has been replicated ,corresponding to the concept of
   a parent node.

3.  MSR6 Explicit Routing

   In order to implement MSR6 TE, the nodes and links along the path
   must be explicitly specified in the packet.

   In SRv6, the segment list is suitable for source route of unicast
   path, which is P2P and could be presented by the data structure of a
   chain with a pointer; In the Segment Routing Header(SRH), the segment
   list is the chain, and the segment left is the pointer.  But for the
   multicast, the path of multicast service is a tree, and can not be
   presented by data structure in a one-dimensional array.  So this
   document introduces new segment to present node/link in a multicast
   tree and introduce structure information in the segment to indicate
   the parent-child relationship during multicast replication.  And all
   the nodes/links along the multicast tree can be encoded into the
   segment list.

   In a multicast tree, when the packet is replicated from one node to
   multiple downstream nodes, parent-child relationship is built up
   between these nodes.  MRH is supposed to encode the nodes along the
   P2MP path and also the parent-child relationship between them.

4.  MSR6 SID Definition

   As defined in [RFC8402], an Segment Identifier is an IPv6 address
   explicitly associated with the segment.  When an SRv6 SID is in the
   Destination Address field of an IPv6 header of a packet, it is routed
   through transit nodes in an IPv6 network as an IPv6 address.

   MSR6 Segment Identifier complies with the definition of the Segment
   Identifier in [RFC8402].  Following the specification in RFC8986, an
   MSR6 SID is consisting of LOC:FUNCT:ARG.  Locator could be
   represented as B:N, B is the MSR6 segment block(IPv6 prefix allocated
   for MSR6 segment by the operator) and N is the identifier of the node
   instantiating the SID.  The MSR6 locator is routable and leads to the
   node which instantiates the SID; Function is the identification of a
   local behavior bound to the MSR6 SID; Argument is the additional
   information requested by the function.

   Typical MSR6 functions and arguments are defined in the following
   sections.

5.  MSR6 Endpoint Behaviors


5.1.  End.RL: MSR6 Endpoint Replication List

   End.RL SID is one of the basic MSR6 SID as an extension of End SID
   defined in RFC8986.

   The encoding of segment list which is composed of End.RL SIDs follow
   the rules:

   *  There MUST be an End.RL SID for each Replication Endpoint in the
      multicast tree

   *  The End.RL SIDs, which represent child nodes that have the same
      parent node, MUST be arranged consecutively in the segment list

   *  The End.RL SID for a parent node MUST indicate the position of the
      End.RL SIDs for the child nodes

   There are 2 arguments for each End.RL SID:

   *  "Replication number" is used for indicating how many times the
      parent node is supposed to execute replication

   *  "Pointer" is used for indicating the position of End.RL SID for
      the first child node in the segment list;

   When the packet is received by an Replication Endpoint and the DA of
   this packet is a local SID with the function of End.RL, the packet
   will be replicated based on the "replication number".  The DA of the
   1st replicated packet is replaced by the SL="pointer" and the value
   of Segment Left is set to "pointer"; the DA of the 2nd replicated
   packet is replaced by the SL="pointer -1" and the value of Segment
   Left is set to "pointer-1".  The packet is sent out based on the
   updated DA.  Repeat the operation untill all the replicated packets
   are sent out.

   The replication node does the following when the DA of the packet is
   a local End.RL SID.

   S01. When an MRH is processed {
   S02.   If (Segments Left == 0 or Replication Number==Pointer==0) {
   S03.      Stop processing the MRH, and proceed to process the next
                header in the packet, whose type is identified by
                the Next Header field in the routing header.
   S04.   }
   S05.   If (IPv6 Hop Limit <= 1) {
   S06.      Send an ICMP Time Exceeded message to the Source Address
                with Code 0 (Hop limit exceeded in transit),
                interrupt packet processing, and discard the packet.
   S07.   }
   S08.   max_LE = (Hdr Ext Len / 2) - 1
   S09.   If ((Last Entry > max_LE) or (Segments Left > Last Entry+1)) {
   S10.      Send an ICMP Parameter Problem to the Source Address
                with Code 0 (Erroneous header field encountered)
                and Pointer set to the Segments Left field,
                interrupt packet processing, and discard the packet.
   S11.   }
   S12.   Decrement IPv6 Hop Limit by 1
   S13.   Replicate the packet based on the "replication number" in the
            argument of the SID
   S14.   Set the Segment Left of the 1st replicated packet to "Pointer" in
            the argument of the SID
   S15.   Update IPv6 DA with Segment List[Pointer]
            respectively in each replicated packet
   S16.   Submit the packet to the egress IPv6 FIB lookup for
            transmission to the new destination
   S17.   Repeat S14-S17 with "Pointer+n"(n=the number of packets which have
            been updated) untill all the packets are transmitted to based
            on the updated DA
   R18.   }

5.2.  End.RL.X: MSR6 L3 Cross-Connect

   End.RL.X SID is one of the basic MSR6 SID as an extension of End.X
   SID defined in RFC8986.

   The encoding of segment list which is composed of End.RL.X SIDs
   follow the rules:

   *  There MUST be an End.RL.X SID for each downstream link connected
      to a Replication Endpoint in the multicast tree

   *  The End.RL.X SIDs corresponding to downstream links of the same
      Replication Endpoint MUST be arranged consecutively in the segment
      list

   *  The End.RL.X SID for a parent node MUST indicate the position of
      the End.RL.X SIDs for the child nodes

   There are 2 arguments for each End.RL SID:

   *  "Replication number" is used for indicating how many times the
      existing node is supposed to execute replication

   *  "Pointer" is used for indicating the position of End.RL.X SID for
      the first downstream link of the child node in the segment list;

   When the packet is received by a Replication Endpoint and the DA of
   this packet is a local SID with the function of End.RL.X, the packet
   will be replicated based on the "replication number".  The DA of the
   1st replicated packet is replaced by the Segment List[ pointer ] and
   the value of Segment Left is set to "pointer"; The packet is sent out
   through the link indicated by the SID. the DA of the 2nd replicated
   packet is replaced by the Segment List [SL +1] and the value of
   Segment Left is set to "SL+1"; The DA of the 2nd packet is replaced
   by the Segment List [ pointer2 ] (pointer2 is the argument in the
   Segment List [SL+1]) and the value of Segment Left is set to
   "pointer2"; The packet is sent out through the link indicated by the
   SID; Repeat the operation untill all the replicated packets are sent
   out through the indicated links.

   S03.      Stop processing the MRH, and proceed to process the next
                header in the packet, whose type is identified by

                interrupt packet processing, and discard the packet.
   S11.   }
   S12.   Decrement IPv6 Hop Limit by 1
   S13.   Replicate the packet based on the "replication number" in the
            argument of the SID
   S14.   Set the Segment Left of the 1st replicated packet to "Pointer" in
            the argument of the SID
   S15.   Update IPv6 DA with Segment List[Pointer]
   S16.   Transmit the packet through the indicated link
   S17.   Set the Segment Left of the 2nd replicated packet to "Segment Left+1" in
            the argument of the SID
   S18.   Update IPv6 DA with Segment List[Segment Left+1]
   S19.   Set the Segment Left of the 2nd replicated packet to "Pointer 2" in
            the argument of the updated SID
   S20.   Update IPv6 DA with Segment List[Pointer 2]
   S21.   Transmit the packet through the indicated link
   S22.   Repeat S17-S21 with "Pointer+n"(n=the number of packets which have
            been updated) untill all the packets are transmitted to based
            on the updated DA
   R23.   }

   It includes:

   Locator: could represented as B:N where B is the MRH segment block
   (IPv6 prefix allocated for MRH segment by the operator) and N is the
   identifier of the node instantiating the SID.  When the locator part
   of the MRH segment is routable, it leads to the node, which
   instantiates the SID.

   Function: an identification of a local behavior bound to the MRH.
   Replication is default behavior for any MRH segment, which doesn't
   need function indication.

   Replication number is used for indicating how many times the existing
   node is supposed to excute replication

   Pointer is used for indicating the position of MSR6 SID for the child
   node;

   Segments for the group of child nodes which belong to the same parent
   node MUST be encoded together in the segment list.  So Pointer and
   replication number could determine the upper bound and lower bound of
   the value range of segment left for the child nodes.

   The destination address of the packet is the IPv6 address of the
   existing Replication Endpoint.  The next header of the IPv6 header
   points to a Routing Header and the type of the routing header is MRH
   Type.

7.  MSR6 Compression


7.1.  MSR6 Requirement for Compression

   Different from unicast, MSR is designed for an explicit multicast
   tree rather than a p2p path: the former contains more nodes than the
   latter generally.  So the header overhead is one of the key challenge
   for MSR6, which limits the scalability and the potential deployment
   scenario.

   There are some SRH compression solutions under discussion in IETF.
   These solutions could also be used for MSR6 with modification.

   Function: an identification of a local behavior bound to the MRH.
   Replication is default behavior for any MRH segment, which doesn't
   need function indication.

   Arguments: follow the definition in section 6, including replication
   number and pointer.

   The processing process is:

   The destination address of the packet is the IPv6 address of the
   existing Replication Endpoint.  The next header of the IPv6 header
   points to a Routing Header and the type of the routing header is MRH
   Type 2.  The Replication Endpoint is supposed to

   *  Find the next groups of segments in the MRH which present the
      child nodes of the existing Replication Endpoint with Pointer-1
      and Pointer-2;

   *  Replicate the packet based on the number of child nodes, which is
      the replication number;

   *  Replace the SID part of IPv6 destination address with the
      corresponding child node's segment in order for each replicated
      packet;

   *  Update the segment left field of each replicated packet based on
      the location child node's segment;

   *  Forward the packet to the output port based on the FIB with the
      existing destination address as an entry;

   to 2 and DA is replaced by Segment List[2]; In the 2nd packet, the
   Segment Left is set to 3 and DA is replaced by Segment List[3]; The
   packets are routed to the node B and node C respectively.

   In MSR6 Replication Endpoint B, the destination address of the IPv6
   header is the local SID of node B.  Based on the End.RL behavior
   defined in section 5.1, the packet is replicated to 2 (Replication
   Number+1=1+1=2) packets.  In the 1st packet, the Segment Left is set
   to 4 and DA is replaced by Segment List[4]; In the 2nd packet, the
   Segment Left is set to 5 and DA is replaced by Segment List[5]; The
   packets are routed to the node D and node E respectively.

   In MSR Endpoint C, the process is similar.

   In MSRE D, the destination address of the IPv6 header is the local
   SID of node D.  Based on the End.RL behavior defined in section 5.1,
   when replication number=0, node D stops processing the MRH and
   continues to process the next header in the packet.

   packet, the Segment Left is set to 3 and DA is replaced by Segment
   List[3] and send the packet based on the specified adjacency A1; In
   the 2nd packet, the Segment Left is set to 2 and DA is replaced by
   Segment List[2]; Based on the arguments in the updated DA, the
   Segment Left is set to 5 and DA is replaced by Segment List[5] and
   send the packet based on the specified adjacency A2;

   node and send the packet based on the specified adjacency B1; In the
   2nd packet, the DA is replaced by the corresponding leaf stored in
   the node and send the packet based on the specified adjacency B2;

   In MSR Endpoint C, the process is similar.

   In MSRE D, the destination address of the IPv6 header is the local
   SID of node D.  Node D stops processing the MRH, and begin to process
   the next header in the packet.
