1.  Introduction

   Network slicing is a tool to share network resources and to offer
   customized network architectures for diverse use cases that share the
   same underlying infrastructure [NGMN-NS-Framework].  Customers may
   not be familiar with underlying networking technologies, and
   therefore may prefer to interface with network slices in a
   technology-agnostic way.  On the other hand, service providers may
   have multiple candidate technologies for supporting network slicing.
   As shown in Figure 1, there is a gap between technology-agnostic
   network slicing service requirements and specific implementation
   technologies, that needs to be filled by a technology independent
   information model.  Such a technology independent information model
   describes the entities that compose a network slice, their
   properties, attributes and operations, and the way they relate to
   each other of an end to end network slice that may span across

   multiple technology domains.  It is independent of any specific
   repository, software usage, protocol, or platform, hence supports
   common operations and management of network slices.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Other network slicing related terminology used in this document are
   interpreted as description in [COMS-PS].

3.  Network Slice Tree Structure

   The YANG data modeling language [RFC7950] will be used to represent
   the transport network slicedata model.  Moreover,the data model for
   network topologies developed in [draft-ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo]
   will be used as a base.

   The proposed NS information model includes the following elements:
   connectivity resources, storage resources, compute resources, service
   instance based on predefined function blocks, network slice level
   attributes, etc.  It is presented as a tree structure of attributes.
   The Yang language is used to represent the network slice information
   model.  The following tree shows an overview of the tree structure.
   New attributes proposed in this draft are in the "netslice:"
   namespace, while other attributes are defined in
   [draft-ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo].

3.1.  resources

   Basic resources are used to construct a network slice.  Resources
   comprise: nodes, links, compute units and storage units.

   Different resources can exist independently, they can also be bound
   together when necessary.  For example, bind a storage unit to a
   connectivity node.

   A whole network attribute can represent a network slice instance.
   The network slice instance "supporting network" list can include
   underlying networks which are used to implement the network slice.

   In this model, nodes and links will represent virtual nodes and links
   exposed to the slice user.

   The network-id attribute will represent a network slice instance ID.

   Nodes are defined in [draft-ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo].

   Nodes are augmented with the following attributes, that used to
   represent requirements, configuration and statistics associated with
   a termination point:

   packet-rate: the packet forwarding capability of a port for this node
   in the unit of pps (packet per second).

   packet-loss-probability: a statistical value which reflects the
   probability of packet loss.

   packet-loss-threshold: a threshold of the packet loss probability.
   If the value of packet-loss-probability is larger than packet-loss-
   threshold, should actively notify the management system.

   received-packets: a statistical value which reflects the number of
   received packets in a period of time.

   sent-packets: a statistical value which reflects the number of sent
   packets in a period of time.

   Links are defined in [draft-ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo].

   Links are associated with nodes through termination points placed
   under nodes.  Links are augmented with QoS information as follows:

   link-bandwidth-agreement: specify the bandwidth requirement for this
   link.  If this parameter does not be set specifically, then the link
   will be constructed according to the default bandwidth value provided
   by management plane.

   link-throughput: the current throughput of this link.

   link-throughput-threshold: a threshold for link throughput.  If the
   value of link-throughput is smaller than link-throughput-threshold,
   should actively notify the management system.

   The slice-level-attributes refers to a set of attributes applicable
   to a network slice.  Some explanations are provided as follows for
   easy going:

   service-time-start/end: specify the time during which the network
   slice service exists (e.g., three months, one year).

   lifecycle-status: specify the status of the network slice, there are
   four enumeration values: construction, modification, activation and
   deletion.

   access-control: illustrates each role can take what kind of
   operations on the network slice.

   reliability-level: the ability of a network slice to be in a stable
   state.  In this document, the main method to achieve reliability is
   "backup".  If necessary, other methods also can be extended based on
   the current definition.  The detailed definition of Reliability_Level
   is provided in Table 1.

   resource-reservation-level: classify different resource reservation
   levels of a network slice.  This attribute is related to the slice
   isolation but is not strictly bound.  The detailed definition is
   provided in Table 2.

   availability: a statistical value which reflects the probability for
   a network slice instance to work with expected SLA in a period of
   time (e.g., 99.999% of time).

   availability-threshold: a threshold of the availability.  If the
   value of Availability is smaller than Availability_Threshold, should
   actively notify the management system.

4.  Operations

   The defined information model should be able to support the following
   operations on network slices.  Except for support the operations on a
   complete network slice, each element insides a network slice also
   should be able to be operated specifically.

   o  construct: construct a network slice

Internet-Draft               Network slicing                January 2018


   o  delete: delete a network slice

   o  modify: modify a constructed network slice

   o  set_element_value: set the value of an indicated element in a
      network slice

   o  get_element_value: get the value of an indicated element in a
      network slice

   o  monitor: monitor the status of a network slice

   o  enable_report: enable the active report to the subscribes/
      management system when the monitored status changes beyond
      expectation
