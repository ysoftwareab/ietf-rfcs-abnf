ra=  Reporting Address (plain-text; OPTIONAL; no default).  MUST be a
      local-part (see Section 3.4.1 of [MAIL]) specifying an e-mail
      address to which a report SHOULD be sent when mail claiming to be
      from this domain (see Section 2.4 of [SPF] for a description of
      how domains are identified for SPF checks) has failed the
      evaluation algorithm described in [SPF], in particular because a
      message arrived via an unauthorized route.  To generate a complete
      address to which the report is sent, the verifier simply appends
      to this value an "@" followed by the SPF domain per paragraph 4.1
      of [SPF]. ra= modifiers in a record that was reached by following
      an include: mechanism MUST be ignored.

      ABNF:

spf-report-tag = %x72.61 "=" qp-section

rp=  Requested Report Percentage (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is
      "100").  The value is an integer from 0 to 100 inclusive that
      indicates what percentage of incidents of SPF failures, selected
      at random, are to cause reports to be generated.  The report
      generator SHOULD NOT issue reports for more than the requested
      percentage of incidents.  An exception to this might be some out-
      of-band arrangement between two parties to override it with some
      mutually agreed value.  Report generators MAY make use of the
      "Incidents:" field in [ARF] to indicate that there are more
      reportable incidents than there are reports.

      ABNF:

spf-rp-tag = %x72.69 *WSP "=" *WSP 1*12DIGIT "/" 1*12DIGIT

rr=  Requested Reports (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is "all").  The
      value MUST be a colon-separated list of tokens representing those
      conditions under which a report is desired.  See Section 4.1 for a
      list of valid tags.
      ABNF:

spf-rr-type = ( "all" / "e" / "f" / "s" / "n" )

spf-rr-tag = %x72.72 "=" spf-rr-type 0* ( ":" spf-rr-type )
