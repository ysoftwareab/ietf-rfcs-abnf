1.  Introduction

This memo addresses the fields within the IGMP protocol headers for
which the IANA assigns values.

The terms "Specification Required", "Expert Review", "IESG Approval",
"IETF Consensus", and "Standards Action", are used in this memo to refer
to the processes described in [2].

2.  Temporary Assignments

>From time to time temporary assignments are made in the values for
fields in these headers for use in experiments.  IESG Approval is
required for any such temporary assignments.

3.  IANA Considerations for fields in the IPv4 IGMP header

The IPv4 IGMP header [1] contains the following fields that carry values
assigned from IANA-managed name spaces: Type and Code. Code field values
are defined relative to a specific Type value.

Values for the IPv4 ICMP Type fields are allocated using an IESG
Approval or Standards Action processes. Code Values for existing IPv4
ICMP Type fields are allocated using IESG Approval or Standards Action
processes. The policy for assigning Code values for new IPv4 ICMP Types
should be defined in the document defining the new Type value.

4.  Security Considerations

Security analyzers such as firewalls and network intrusion detection
monitors often rely on unambiguous interpretations of the fields
described in this memo.  As new values for the fields are assigned,
existing security analyzers that do not understand the new values may
fail, resulting in either loss of connectivity if the analyzer declines
to forward the unrecognized traffic, or loss of security if it does
forward the traffic and the new values are used as part of an attack.
This vulnerability argues for high visibility (which the Standards
Action and IETF Consensus processes ensure) for the assignments whenever
possible.

initial version of igmp-parameters file.  Should probably not be
published in RFC.)

IGMP TYPE NUMBERS

The Internet Group Message Protocol (IGMP) has many messages that
are identified by a "type" field.

Note that the original definition of IGMP in RFC1112 divided this
field into two 4-byte values, "version" and "type".  This was
decided to be too restrictive, so the fields were combined into a
single 8-bit type space.

Type    Name                                    Reference

Many of these ICMP types have a "code" field.  Here we list the types
again with their assigned code fields.
