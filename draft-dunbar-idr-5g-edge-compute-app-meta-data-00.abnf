      LoadIndex-i: weighted combination of the total bytes (or/and
      packets) sent to/received from the Application Server at
      Site-i during a fixed time period.

      Beta-i (larger value means higher capacity): capacity index
      at the site i.

      Delay-i: Network latency measurement (RTT) to the A-ER that
      has the Application Server attached at the site-i.

      gamma (larger value means higher preference): Network
      Preference index for the site-I.



Type= TBD2: measurements of packets/bytes to/from the App
Type =TBD3: Aggregated Load Measurement Index derived from the
Index=w1*ToPackets+w2*FromPackes+w3*ToBytes+w4*FromBytes
