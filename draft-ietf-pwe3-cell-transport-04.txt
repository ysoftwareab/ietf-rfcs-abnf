2. Introduction

   This transparent cell transport service allows migration of ATM
   services to a PSN without having to provision the ATM subscriber or
   customer edge (CE) devices.  The ATM CEs will view the ATM
   transparent cell transport service as if they were directly connected
   via a TDM leased line.  This service is most likely to be used as an
   internal function in a ATM service provider's network as a way to
   connect existing ATM switches via a higher speed PSN, or to provide
   ATM "backhaul" services for remote access to existing ATM networks.

3. Transparent Cell Transport Definition

   The transparent port service is a natural application of the "N-to-
   one" VCC cell transport mode for PWE3 ATM encapsulation described in
   [2], and MUST be used with pseudowires of type 0x0003, "ATM 
   transparent cell transport" [4].

   The ATM transparent port service emulates connectivity between two
   remote ATM ports. This service is useful when one desires to connect
   two CEs without processing or switching at the VPC or VCC layer.  The
   ingress PE discards any idle/unassigned cells received from the
   ingress ATM port, and maps all other received cells to a single
   pseudowire.

   The egress PE does not change the VPI, VCI, PTI, or CLP bits when it
   sends these cells on the egress ATM port.  Therefore the transparent

   port service appears to emulate an ATM transmission convergence layer
   connection between two ports.  However, since the ingress PE discards
   idle/unassigned cells, this service benefits from statistical
   multiplexing bandwidth savings.

   In accordance with [2], cell concatenation MAY be used for
   transparent cell relay transport in order to save the PSN bandwidth.
   If used, it MUST be agreed between the ingress and egress PEs. In
   particular, if the Pseudo Wire has been set up using the PWE3 control
   protocol [3], the ingress PE MUST NOT exceed the value of the
   "Maximum Number of concatenated ATM cells" Pseudowire Interface
   Parameter Sub-TLV type (Interface Parameter ID = 0x02 [4]) received
   in the Label Mapping message for the Pseudo Wire, and MUST NOT use
   cell concatenation if this parameter has been omitted by the egress
   PE.
   
   ATM OAM cells MUST be transported transparently, and the PEs do not
   act on them. If the PEs detect a PSN or pseudowire failure between
   them, they do not generate any OAM cells, but rather bring down the
   ATM interfaces to the CEs (e.g. generating LOS on the ATM port),
   just as if it were a transmission layer failure.
   
   Similarly, ATM ILMI signaling from the CEs, if any, MUST be
   transported transparently, and the PEs do not act on it.  However,
   the PEs must act on physical interface failure by either withdrawing
   the PW labels or by using pseudowire status signaling to indicate the
   interface failure.  The procedures for both alternatives are
   described in [3].
   
4. Security Considerations

   This draft does not introduce any new security considerations beyond
   those in [2] and [3]. This document defines an application that
   utilizes the encapsulation specified in [2], and does not specify the
   protocols used to carry the encapsulated packets across the PSN. Each
   such protocol may have its own set of security issues, but those
   issues are not affected by the application specified herein. Note
   that the security of the transported ATM service will only be as good
   as the security of the PSN. This level of security might be less
   rigorous then a native ATM service.

5. IANA Considerations 
  
   This document does not require any IANA actions.
