                     Handling of TCP ACK throttling
                  draft-lvelvindron-ack-throttling-03

Abstract

   The functionality provided by the TCP ACK throttling mechanism can be
   exploited as a side channel vulnerablity to terminate connections
   between two arbitrary hosts and inject data in the communication
   stream.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5961] defines the challenge ACK response mechanism as a technique
   to mitigate against blind in-window attacks.  Specifically, an ACK
   packet is sent in response to an incoming segment with a SYN bit to
   confirm that the preceding connection was lost.  Another case is
   sending an ACK packet if the RST packet is received but the sequence
   number does not match the next expected sequence number.  Lastly, to
   prevent data injection, the range of valid ACK value is reduced for
   better strictness, so the likelihood of old ACK values and very new
   ACK values are discarded.  In all of those cases, the ACK packet is
   referrered to as a "Challenge ACK" through the rest of this document.

   [RFC5961] also introduces an ACK throttling mechanism to reduce
   possible wastage of CPU and bandwidth resources by limiting the
   number of challenge ACK that can be sent in a given interval.

   An attacker can leverage the Challenge ACK and the ACK throttling
   mechanism to abuse on the global ACK throttling rate-limit on a
   target host.  Through a series of step, the attacker can send spoofed
   packets to the target host, affect the the global challenge ACK rate-
   limiter, count the number of challenge ACK received, and finally
   compare that number with the target system limit.

   The attacker can then gather clues about: the existence of a 4-tuple
   connection, the next expected sequence number, and the expected ACK
   number.

   Based on the gathered information, the attacker can mount connection
   reset attacks and data injection attacks.  Those attacks have been
   demonstrated to work in real-world constraints according to [CBR01].

1.1.  Terminology

   Challenge ACK in this document denotes the ACK packet sent in
   response to an segment whose RST bit is set and the sequence number

   does not fully match the next expected sequence value, but is within
   the current receive window as defined in [RFC5961].

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Recommendation for ACK throttling mechanism

   An implementation SHOULD have a per-socket ACK throttling mechanism
   which is not shared across the system.  This makes it more difficult
   to abuse compared to having a single (global) ACK throttling
   mechanism.  Additionally, an implementation may also introduce a
   randomized value to the interval defined in Section 7 of [RFC5961].
   This makes the attacks defined in section 1 much more difficult.

3.  Operations

   It will take time to update all of the TCP implementations that fully
   implement the ACK throttling mechanism as described in [RFC5961].

   An operator can increase the value of the ACK throttling limit to the
   highest value possible to mitigate the risk of the vulnerabilities
   defined in section 1.

4.  IANA Considerations

   None of the proposed measures have an impact on IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   The purpose of this document is to document security improvements to
   the ACK throttling mechanism and also how an operator can mitigate
   side channel vulnerabilities.  Specific examples of those
   vulnerabilities can be found in [CBR01].  In particular, the ACK
   throttling mechanism leads to a side-channel vulnerability that can
   be leveraged for connection reset and data injection attacks.  A
   description of this functionality can be found in section 1.
