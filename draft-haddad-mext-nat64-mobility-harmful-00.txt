Abstract

   This memo discusses potential NAT64 technology repercussions for
   mobile nodes using Mobile IPv6.  An ambiguity is identified related
   to the use of DNS during bootstrapping, which is likely to inhibit
   proper signaling between mobile node and home agent.

1.  Introduction

   NAT64 technology, as described in
   [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful], enables faster IPv4 network
   conversion to IPv6-only operation while maintaining contact with the
   remaining global IPv4 Internet.  In this document, we are concerned
   with IPv6-only nodes attached to a network for which NAT64 provides
   connectivity with IPv4 networks.

   This document aims to highlight potential NAT64 repercussions for
   mobile nodes using Mobile IPv6 ([I-D.ietf-mext-rfc3775bis]) and
   attached to a network behind a NAT64.

3.  NAT64 Incompatibility with Mobile IPv6

   NAT technologies have from the very beginning exhibited numerous
   incompatibities with the Internet.  Hence, the new incompatibility
   described in this document should not come as a surprise!

   The NAT64 mechanism considered here complies with the DNS64
   technology described in [I-D.ietf-behave-dns64] to provide the
   querying host with a synthetic DNS response in which, the queried
   FQDN is locally translated to an IPv6 address using the v6 prefix
   assigned to the NAT64 v6 interface.  By inserting the translated IPv6
   address in the synthetic DNS response, the querying node acts as if
   the destination is also using an IPv6 stack.  This, in turn, enables
   the two nodes to establish a session during which, all exchanged
   packets are routed through the querying node's local NAT64 in order
   to reach their destinations.

   As NAT64 technology is likely to be widely deployed, we consider its
   behavior in relationship to Mobile IPv6.  For this purpose, suppose
   that a mobile node (MN) configured with an IPv6 home address (HoA)
   leaves its NAT64-serviced home network and attaches to a foreign
   network also serviced by NAT64, and configures a new IPv6 address,
   i.e., a care-of address (CoA).  We analyze two scenarios which
   require using MIPv6 either to maintain a session, or to establish an
   optimal path to exchange the data packets, using MIPv6 route
   optimization (RO).

   In the first scenario, suppose that before detaching from its home
   network, the MN has established a session with a corresponding node
   (CN) which is attached to an IPv4 network.  Due to the NAT64 presence
   in the home network, the MN acts as if it were communicating with an
   IPv6-enabled CN.  Hence, the MN decides upon attaching to the new
   NAT64-serviced foreign network, to run the MIPv6 return routability
   procedure with the CN by sending first a home test init (HoTI)
   message via its home agent.  Such messages will be discarded either
   by the CN or by a more intelligent NAT64 -- in which case it would
   likely be followed by an ICMP message sent to the MN.  In both cases,
   the MN can detect that the RR procedure is failing.  Consequently,
   there is little harm to the MN's communications and no data packet
   loss since the MN will keep using MIPv6 bidirectional tunneling (BT)
   mode.

   However, the situation worsens when we consider another scenario in
   which the MN decides to establish a session with the same CN from the
   foreign NAT64-serviced network.  In such case, the MN will first
   obtain a synthetic DNS reply which presents the CN as being an IPv6-
   enabled node.  Based on that, the MN may try to create a binding at
   the CN.  The MN might first run the RR procedure which will

   ultimately fail (for the same reasons as in the first scenario).
   More likely, the MN will initiate the session with the CN by using
   the BT mode then switching to the RO mode.  In this case, the MN
   first tunnels its data packets to its HA without having them being
   intercepted by the foreign NAT64.  However, after reaching the HA,
   the data packets will most likely be dropped at some point.  This is
   due to the presence of the foreign NAT64 IPv6 prefix in the CN's IPv6
   address.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document describes scenarios where a NAT64, using DNS64, can
   disrupt communications to a mobile node visiting the associated
   network.  It does not introduce any new security vulnerabilities,
   provide any guidance about how to improve security, or describe any
   effects on existing security practices.
