Amplification Attacks Using the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
             draft-mattsson-t2trg-amplification-attacks-00

Abstract

   Protecting Internet of Things (IoT) devices against attacks is not
   enough.  IoT deployments need to make sure that they are not used for
   Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks.  DDoS attacks are
   typically done with compromised devices or with amplification attacks
   using a spoofed source address.  This document gives examples of
   different theoretical amplification attacks using the Constrained
   Application Protocol (CoAP).  The goal with this document is to raise
   awareness and to motivate generic and protocol-specific
   recommendations on the usage of CoAP.  Some of the discussed attacks
   can be mitigated by not using NoSec or by using the Echo option.

1.  Introduction

   One important protocol used to interact with Internet of Things (IoT)
   sensors and actuators is the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
   [RFC7252].  CoAP can be used without security in the so called NoSec
   mode but any Internet-of-Things (IoT) deployment valuing security and
   privacy would use a security protocol such as DTLS
   [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13], TLS [RFC8446], or OSCORE [RFC8613] to protect
   CoAP, where the choice of security protocol depends on the transport
   protocol and the presence of intermediaries.  The use of CoAP over
   UDP and DTLS is specified in [RFC7252] and the use of CoAP over TCP
   and TLS is specified in [RFC8323].  OSCORE protects CoAP end-to-end
   with the use of COSE [RFC8152] and the CoAP Object-Security option
   [RFC8613] and can therefore be used over any transport.  Group OSCORE
   [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm] can be used to protect CoAP Group
   Communication [I-D.ietf-core-groupcomm-bis].

   Protecting Internet of Things (IoT) devices against attacks is not
   enough.  IoT deployments need to make sure that they are not used for
   Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks.  DDoS attacks are
   typically done with compromised devices or with amplification attacks
   using a spoofed source address.  DDoS attacks is a huge and growing
   problem for services and critical infrastucture [DDoS-Infra].

   The document gives examples of different theoretical amplification
   attacks using CoAP.  When transported over UDP, the CoAP NoSec mode
   is susceptible to source IP address spoofing and as a single request

   can result in multiple responses from multiple servers, CoAP can have
   very large amplification factors.  The goal with this document is to
   raise awareness and to motivate generic and protocol-specific
   recommendations on the usage of CoAP.

   Some of the discussed attacks can be mitigated by not using NoSec or
   by using the Echo option [I-D.ietf-core-echo-request-tag].

2.  Amplification Attacks using CoAP

   In a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, an attacker sends a large number
   of requests or responses to a target endpoint.  The denial-of-service
   might be caused by the target endpoint receiving a large amount of
   data, sending a large amount of data, doing heavy processing, or
   using too much memory, etc.  In a Distributed Denial-of-Service
   (DDoS) attack, the request or responses come from a large number of
   sources.

   In an amplification attack, the amplification factor is the ratio
   between the total size of the data sent to the target and the total
   size of the data sent by the attacker.  In the attacks described in
   this section, the attacker sends one or more requests, and the target
   receives one or more responses.  An amplification attack alone can be
   a denial-of-service attack on a CoAP server by making it send a large
   amount of data.  But often amplification attacks are combined with
   the attacker spoofing the source IP address of the targeted victim.
   By requesting as much information as possible from several servers an
   attacker can multiply the amount of traffic and create a distributed
   denial-of-service attack on the target.  When transported over UDP,
   the CoAP NoSec mode is susceptible to source IP address spoofing.

   Amplification attacks with CoAP are unfortunately not only theory.
   Powerful CoAP amplification attacks made headlines in 2018, reaching
   55 Gbps on average, and with the largest one clocking at 320 Gbps
   [DDoS-ZDNET].  But in 2019, they were hardly seen anymore
   [DDoS-2019].  In 2020, the FBI cyber division mentioned CoAP in a
   public notification warning that cyber actors are increasingly likely
   to abuse network protocols for DDoS attacks [DDoS-FBI].  CoAP
   amplification attacks made a comeback in 2020 and CoAP was behind a
   significant part of global DDoS attacks in Q4 2020 and Q1 2021, but
   not at all in Q2 and Q3 of 2021 [DDoS-2021].  It seems unclear
   exactly how the attacks were done, why they stopped, and how likely
   CoAP amplifications attacks are to come back in the future.

   The following sections give examples of different theoretical
   amplification attacks using CoAP.

2.1.  Simple Amplification Attacks

   An amplification attack using a single response is illustrated in
   Figure 1.  If the response is c times larger than the request, the
   amplification factor is c.

           Figure 1: Amplification attack using a single response

   An attacker can increase the bandwidth by sending several GET
   requests.  An attacker can also increase or control the amplification
   factor by creating or updating resources.  By creating new resources,
   an attacker can increase the size of /.well-known/core.  An
   amplification attack where the attacker influences the amplification
   factor is illustrated in Figure 2.

                            amplification factor

2.2.  Amplification Attacks using Observe

   Amplification factors can be significantly worse when combined with
   observe [RFC7641] and group requests [I-D.ietf-core-groupcomm-bis].
   As a single request can result in multiple responses from multiple
   servers, the amplification factors can be very large.

   An amplification attack using observe is illustrated in Figure 3.  If
   each notification response is c times larger than the registration
   request and each request results in n notifications, the
   amplification factor is c * n.  By registering the same client
   several times using different Tokens or port numbers, the bandwidth
   can be increased.  By updating the observed resource, the attacker
   may trigger notifications and increase the size of the notifications.
   By using conditional attributes
   [I-D.ietf-core-conditional-attributes] an attacker may increase the
   frequency of notifications and therefore the amplification factor.
   The maximum period attribute pmax indicates the maximum time, in
   seconds, between two consecutive notifications (whether or not the
   resource state has changed).  If it is predictable when notifications
   are sent as confirmable and which Message ID are used the
   acknowledgements may be spoofed.

2.3.  Amplification Attacks using Group Requests

   An amplification attack using a group request is illustrated in
   Figure 4.  The group request is sent over multicast or broadcast and
   in this case a single request results in m responses from m different
   servers.  If each response is c times larger than the request, the
   amplification factor is c * m.  Note that the servers usually do not
   know the variable m.

               Figure 4: Amplification attack using multicast

   An amplification attack using a multicast request and observe is
   illustrated in Figure 5.  In this case a single request results in n
   responses each from m different servers giving a total of n * m
   responses.  If each response is c times larger than the request, the
   amplification factor is c * n * m.

2.4.  MITM Amplification Attacks

   TLS and DTLS without Connection ID [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls-connection-id]
   validate the IP address and port of the other peer, binds them to the
   connection, and do not allow them to change.  DTLS with Connection ID
   allows the IP address and port to change at any time.  As the source
   address is not protected, an MITM attacker can change the address.
   Note that an MITM attacker is a more capable attacker then an
   attacker just spoofing the source address.  It can be discussed if
   and how much such an attack is reasonable for DDoS, but DTLS 1.3
   states that "This attack is of concern when there is a large
   asymmetry of request/response message sizes."  [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13].

   DTLS 1.2 with Connection ID [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls-connection-id]
   requires that "the receiver MUST NOT replace the address" unless
   "there is a strategy for ensuring that the new peer address is able
   to receive and process DTLS records" but does not give more details
   than that.  It seems like the receiver can start using the new peer
   address and test that it is able to receive and process DTLS records
   at some later point.  DTLS 1.3 with Connection ID requires that
   "implementations MUST NOT update the address" unless "they first
   perform some reachability test" but does not give more details than
   that.  OSCORE [RFC8613] does not discuss address updates, but it can
   be assumed that most servers send responses to the address it
   received the request from without any reachability test.  A
   difference between (D)TLS and OSCORE is that in DTLS the updated
   address is used for all future records, while in OSCORE a new address
   is only used for responses to a specific request.

   An MITM amplification attack updating the client's source address in
   an observe registration is illustrated in Figure 6.  This attack is
   possible in OSCORE and DTLS with Connection ID.  The server will send
   notifications to the Victim until it at some unspecified point
   requires an acknowledgement [RFC7641].  In DTLS 1.2 the reachability
   test might be done at a later point.  In OSCORE a reachability test
   is likely not done.

3.  Summary

   CoAP has always considered amplification attacks, but most of the
   requirements in [RFC7252], [RFC7641],
   [I-D.ietf-core-echo-request-tag], and [I-D.ietf-core-groupcomm-bis]
   are "SHOULD" instead of "MUST", it is undefined what a "large
   amplification factor" is, [RFC7641] does not specify how many
   notifications that can be sent before a potentially spoofable
   acknowledgement must be sent, and in several cases the "SHOULD" level
   is further softened by "If possible" and "generally".
   [I-D.ietf-core-conditional-attributes] does not have any
   amplification attack considerations.

Internet-Draft         CoAP Amplification Attacks          February 2022


   QUIC [RFC9000] mandates that "an endpoint MUST limit the amount of
   data it sends to the unvalidated address to three times the amount of
   data received from that address" without any exceptions.  This
   approach should be seen as current best practice.

   While it is clear when a QUIC implementation violates the requirement
   in [RFC9000], it is not clear when a CoAP implementation violates the
   requirement in [RFC7252], [RFC7641],
   [I-D.ietf-core-echo-request-tag], and [I-D.ietf-core-groupcomm-bis].

   In CoAP, an address can be validated with a security protocol or by
   using the Echo Option [I-D.ietf-core-echo-request-tag].  Restricting
   the bandwidth per server is not enough as the number of servers the
   attacker can use is typically unknown.  For multicast requests, anti-
   amplification limits and the Echo Option do not really work unless
   the number of servers sending responses is known.  Even if the
   responses have the same size as the request, the amplification factor
   from m servers is m, where m is typically unknown.  While DoS attacks
   from CoAP servers accessible over the Internet pose the largest
   threat, an attacker on a local network (e.g, a compromised node)
   might use local CoAP servers to attack targets on the Internet or on
   the local network.
