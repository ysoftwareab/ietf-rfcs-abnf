Abstract

   Network Slicing is meant to enable creating (end-to-end) partitioned
   network infrastructure that may include the user equipment, access/
   core transport networks, edge and central data center resources to
   provide differentiated connectivity behaviors to fulfill the
   requirements of distinct services, applications and customers.  In
   this context, connectivity is not restricted to differentiated
   forwarding capabilities but it covers also advanced service functions
   that will be invoked when transferring data within a given domain.

   The purpose of this document is to focus on use cases that benefit
   from the use of network slicing.

1.  Introduction

   Network Slicing enables the creation of (end-to-end) partitioned
   network infrastructure that may include the user equipment, access/
   core transport networks, edge and central data center resources to
   provide differentiated connectivity behaviors to fulfill the
   requirements of distinct services, applications and customers.  In
   this context, connectivity is not restricted to differentiated
   forwarding capabilities but it also spans service, management and
   control plane support offered to a slice instance.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

1.2.  Terminology

   Please refer to [I-D.geng-netslices-architecture] for related
   terminologies and definitions.

   Additionally, the following terms are used:

   o  V2X (Vehicle-to-everything): Is a communication of information
      from a vehicle to any other entity that may be another vehicle,
      road-side network element or application end point.

   o  ITS (Intelligent Transportation Systems): Considered as an aspect
      of how using Internet of Things resource like road sensors can
      creates a smart transport network.  The network offers services
      related to transport and traffic management systems through flow
      of information between road-side sensors, vehicles, smart devices
      and humans.

   o  Over-the-top (OTT): A service, e.g., content delivery using a CDN
      or a social networking service, operated by a different service
      providers to which the users of the NSP service are attached to,
      and to whom it serves as a communication (or bit pipe) provider

   o  Industry vertical: A collection of services or tools specific to
      an industry, trade or market sector. also, referred to as Service
      Verticals in this document.

   o  TETRA: Terrestrial trunked radio is a digital trunked mobile radio
      standard to meet needs of public safety, transportation and
      utilities like organizations.

   o  SLA: Service Level Agreement - A contract between a service
      provider and an end user that stipulates a specified level of
      service, support option, a guaranteed level of system performance
      as relates to downtime or up-time.

2.  Scope

   To maximize resource utilization and minimize infrastructure cost,
   services will need to operate over a shared network infrastructure,
   as against the traditional monolithic model operated either as
   dedicated network or as an overlay.  Service operators can utilize or
   benefit from Network Slicing through multi-tenancy, enabling
   different customized network infrastructures for different group of
   services across different network domains and operating them
   independently.

   In this document, multi-domain refers to combination of different
   kinds of connection-technology network domains.  For example, it may
   be a RAN, DSL etc. in access; a fixed, wireless or mobile service
   provider network; as well as different technology domains, in
   transport networks such as carrier Ethernet, optical, MPLS, TE-tunnel
   etc.  Often, a combination of technology domains is under the same
   administrator's control but may also belong to different
   administrative systems and may require cross-domain coordination.

   The document covers generalized as well as resource guaranteed
   service scenarios that can benefit by applying Network Slicing
   principles as below in Figure 1

3.  A Generalized Network Slice as a Service

   Network slicing instances share a common infrastructure, which
   provide flexible design of a logical network with specific network
   functions customized to support differentiated performance
   requirements of vertical industry through logical or physical system
   isolation and certain OAM tools.

   Traditionally, vertical industries run their services in a shared
   network environment upon which infrastructure owners and service
   providers offer standalone network capabilities including
   connections, storage and etc.  Network slicing paradigm enables
   supporting the requirements of a network slicing tenant to be met
   individually.  Hence it is anticipated that this type of new business
   model where network slice instances are leased to industry verticals
   as a service (i.e.  Network Slicing as a Service, NSaaS) may become a
   norm in the near future.

3.1.  Resource Centric Service Concept

   Network services specify a set of resource requirements to offer
   desired Quality of Experience (QoE) to it consumers, using features
   offered by the control and forwarding planes.  Traditional service
   guarantees are associated with resource attributes such as
   throughput, packet loss, latency, network bandwidth/burst or other
   bit rates and security.  In addition, redundancy and reliability are
   provided by the infrastructure to improve overall QoE.  More
   recently, concepts such as edge computing allow opportunistic
   placement of services to meet stringent requirements of low latency
   and/or high bandwidth applications.

   Clearly the description of service delivery is more diverse now than
   before and demands higher degree of resource engineering and agility.
   The motivation behind Network slicing paradigm is to enable new
   service deployments without having to build new network
   infrastructures or causing disruptions to already deployed services
   in the network.  In this regard, there are two primary
   characteristics NS should satisfy, a) Strict demand for network
   resource, b) Network Customization.

Internet-Draft            Netslicing use cases              October 2017


3.2.  Strict Resource Demand

   Several services are sensitive to response times and/or amount of
   bandwidth, e.g. real time interactive multimedia, high bandwidth
   video feed or remote access to an enterprise network.  Failure to
   meet these criteria lead to service degradation.  Moreover, new
   industry verticals are evolving due to technological advancements in
   sensors, IoT, robotics and multi-media, along with new type of
   network interactions (both human-human or human-machine).  These
   impose even stricter resource and connectivity requirements.  The
   challenge lies in utilizing common network infrastructure and
   judiciously allocating available infrastructure resources.

3.3.  Network Customization

   To a network slice tenant, the ability to customize services
   dynamically is important.  Customization gives control to the
   operator of a slice to create, provision and change network resources
   to suit their service demands.  Customization enables decomposition
   of resources from an underlying network infrastructure and logically
   aggregate them as part of a slice.  These customizations also include
   placement and logical connection of the network functions based on
   the service requirements.

3.4.  NSaaS of Different Granularity

   In order to meet various requirements from the network slice tenant,
   NSaaS should be provided with different granularities.  Some typical
   examples of granularities that a provider may offer are as follows.

   o  Network Domain - Network slice instances of different networks
      i.e.  access (wireless, fixed) network, transport network and core
      network.

   o  Access technologies - Network slice instances of different
      generations of cellular and fixed network technologies, i.e. 4G,
      WiFi, Passive Optical Network (PON) and DSL.

   o  SLA requirements - Network slice instances of different SLA
      requirements, i.e. low-latency network, legacy best-effort network
      and network with guaranteed-bandwidth.

   o  Vertical applications - Network slice instances of different
      industry verticals. i.e. manufacturing site, V2X, industrial IoT
      and smart city.






Makhijani, ed, et al.    Expires April 21, 2018                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft            Netslicing use cases              October 2017


   o  OTT services - Network slice instances of different applications
      provided by OTT, i.e. messaging, payment, video streaming and
      gaming.

   o  Cross domain services - Network slice instances of different
      services across multi-provider domains such as l2, l3 VPN
      services.

   During the realization of network slice instance, it is also very
   important that sub-instance of a more general one can be provided
   with a finer granularity.  In practice, it is up to the provider to
   decide the granularity to lease the network slice instances.

   The customization of different granularities of a network slice
   introduce many challenges, especially in terms of network management
   and orchestration.  As a network slice provider (provider of end-to-
   end slice service), it is essential to have a comprehensive
   understanding of the network capability.  This requires that network
   connectivity and resources can be exposed to the network slice
   tenants (as the differentiated services).  Accordingly, network slice
   provider is able to orchestrate specific instances based on these
   exposed capabilities.

3.5.  Service customization across multi-provider multi-domains as NSaaS

   L2 and L3 connectivity services can be deployed in a multi-provider
   multi-domain scenario and, in the SDN era, this implies the
   decoupling of network resources for different service provider and
   domain orchestrators.  The allocation of network resources within the
   domain of each service provider, involved by the end-to-end service,
   can be defined as a network slice.

   Within a single domain, provider is aware of the entire topology and
   its own resource availability and has complete control over those
   resources.  However, in a multi domain scenario, the overall
   knowledge of the resources and topologies cannot be made across
   providers.  Therefore, the exchange of information across these
   providers have to be enabled, as shown in Figure 2, inspired by
   [I-D.bernardos-nfvrg-multidomain] and
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-service-model-explained].

   interface 1 (IF1) to the tenant, interface 2 (IF2) to other multi
   provider MdO (multi domain orchestrator) and an interface 3 (IF3) to
   individual domain orchestrators.  IF1 is exposed to the tenant who
   could request his specific services and/or slices to be deployed.
   IF2 is between the orchestrators and is a key interface to enable
   multi-provider operation.  IF3 focuses on abstracting the technology
   or vendor dependent implementation details to support orchestration
   in each network domain (see [!@I-D.bernardos-nfvrg-multidomain] for
   details).  The coordination alternatives between MP-MdOs are: *
   Bilateral Cascading: providers can have long-lasting business
   agreements only with their direct neighbors.  * Full Mesh between MP-
   MdOs: Providers can have long-lasting business agreement with any
   provider (neighboring or remote).

   This reference architecture is the main focus of the 5GEx European
   Project.

   Among applications, L2VPN and L3VPN wholesale end-to-end services in
   a multi-provider and multi-domain scenario needs the following
   characteristics for network slice management

   o  An automatic activation test and verification functionality (by
      customer or orchestrator).

   o  Interface to modify parameters of L2VPN or L3VPN service such as
      bandwidth or path redundancy.

   Looking at Figure 2, the customer needs a new L2 end-to-end service
   between CPEs across two domains (MP-MdO1 and MP-MdO2).  As MP-MdO1
   receives the service request, it is deployed as a network slice.  In
   this regards MP-Md01 has prior knowledge of topology and resource
   across domains in some form, it then splits the service request into
   a slice across each of the involved domain.  Once service is set up:
   MP-MdO1 allocates resources for the slice on SP1 domain while MP-MdO2
   allocates on SP2 domain respectively.

   [I-D.ietf-l2sm-l2vpn-service-model] and [RFC8049] can describe IF1
   For L2 and L3 end-to-end services respectively.  The ability to map
   such services as network slice will be considerable opportunity for
   dynamic cross-domain operations.

4.  Network Slicing in 3GPP Mobile Network

   Network Slicing is a core capability of the currently under
   development 3GPP 5G phase 1 mobile system, as it makes it possible
   for different service verticals, such as IoT and broadband
   applications, to be deployed over a common shared infrastructure.
   More details can be found in [TS_3GPP.23.501], [TS_3GPP.23.502],
   [TR_3GPP.38.801], [TR_3GPP.33.899] and [TS_3GPP.28.500].

   3GPP is currently defining its own solution for network slicing.  An
   IETF effort in this field may, however, still be complementary in the
   long run as IETF focuses on the IP infrastructure and protocols which
   are generally out of scope of 3GPP.  Challenges relevant to the IETF
   include isolation between network slices, supporting sharing network
   functions between several slices, building slices recursively from
   smaller slice subnets, implementing slicing across different domains
   for roaming, etc.

4.1.  Network Slices in 3GPP Systems

   In 3GPP systems a network slice is a complete logical network which
   provides telecommunication services and network capabilities.
   Distinct Radio Access Network (RAN) slices and core network slices
   interwork to provide mobile connectivity.  A device may access
   multiple NS simultaneously through a single RAN. 3GPP defines slice
   IDs (NSSAI) composed of a Slice Service Type (SST) and a Slice
   Differentiator (SD).  SST refers to an expected network behavior in
   terms of features and services (e.g. specialized for broadband or
   massive IoT), while SD helps distinguishing among several NS
   instances.

   Figure 3 describes the general layout of Network Slicing in mobile
   networks.  A core network slice includes, a Session Management
   Function (SMF), which manages PDU sessions, and a User Plane Function
   (UPF).  Some functions such as the Access and Mobility management
   Function (AMF) are common and shared between multiple RAN and core
   network slices.

4.2.  Creating, Managing and Operating 3GPP Network Slices

   To create a network slice instance, mobile network operators define
   "Network Slice Subnets" into OSS/BSS management system.  NS subnets
   are NS components including NFs and reserved network resources.  OSS/
   BSS communicates with the orchestrator, which, through the rest of
   the NFV-MANO system, configures compute and network elements to
   create, compose and activate slices.

   Mobile network operators can modify the configuration of a RAN or
   core network slice, while it is in use.  To support this, the
   operator needs to measure QoS/SLA data for hosted network services,
   and associate results with the relevant network slice.  Example of
   operations include increase or decrease network capacity or compute
   capacity of NFs; update the configuration of NFs; add, replace or
   remove a NFs or a Network Slice Subnet.

   Slice selection occurs in 2 phases: first, common functions
   (including AMF) and available network slices are pre-selected when
   the device registers with the network.  Later on, the network
   dynamically selects network slices when a device initiates

   communication, based on a slice ID associated with the application
   (on the device) that requests a new flow.

5.  Role of Virtualization in Network slicing

   Virtualization is a key enabler of network slices; Many network
   services can be easily deployed using components of NFV framework
   like network functions, hardware decoupling and resource placement
   [#?NFVSLICE].  When deployed as a network slice, the resources
   associated with virtualized network services are managed uniformly by
   network slice provider.  One such use case is described below.

5.1.  Virtualized Customer Premise Equipment

   A CPE is an equipment that connects the customer premises to the
   provider's network.  A CPE may either be a layer-2 or a layer-3
   device (the routing gateway) performing different network functions
   depending on the access technology (DSL modem, PON modem, etc.).  Any
   services provided such as Internet access, IPTV, VoIP, etc. or
   network functions for example, local NAT, local DHCP, IGMP proxy-
   routing, PPP sessions, routing, etc. are also part of CPE.  The
   installation of different on-premise devices, entails a high cost for
   service providers in terms of both initial installation and
   operational support, since they are typically responsible for the
   end-to-end service.

   Traditional CPE deployments are service provider network functions
   installed on customer site to provide above mentioned functionalities
   along with remote site connectivity.  Communication Service provider
   (CSP) is responsible for management and administration of connections
   and state with proper policy, bandwidth, security and QoS
   requirements.

          Figure 4: Virtualized CPE with distributed architecture

   Figure 4 shows a virtualized architecture in which many functions are
   moved to CSP's cloud simplifying CPE on premises tremendously.
   Additional details of deployment architecture models are captured in
   [I-D.pularikkal-virtual-cpe] where full dissemination of data path
   and control plane functions is described.  The figure shows vCPEx,
   vCPEy, vCPEz are virtualized CPEs on multiple sites of a specific
   customer, there may be set of different network functions in each x,
   y and z CPE.  The vCPE instance in CSP cloud is integrated to each
   site performing service chains of network functions and resource
   allocations specific for ingress and egress path of each site.

   A vCPE is a well-known concept[VCPEBBF] which when combined with WAN
   technologies provides end to end visibility and reachability to
   remote sites.  However, there is no standard approach to connectivity
   or management of various CPE functions.  Using network slicing, a
   greater level of agility can be achieved, with each customer
   dynamically managing its own network with the assistance of network
   slicing framework.

   The benefit of self-managing a vCPE network slice is the capability
   to move network functions on premise of to the cloud.  An obvious use
   case will be customer initiated gradual migration of network
   functions from a site to CSP cloud.

                     Figure 5: vCPE as a Network Slice

   In Figure 5, a slice for vCPE is shown.  Using slice subnet approach,
   each vCPE site instance may be considered as an abstracted subnet,
   along with the WAN transport as another subnet.  The network
   functions are chained in a distributed fashion between site vCPEs and
   CSP vCPE subnet.  A monitoring function interfaces with CSP's global
   slice manager for resource management.  A south-bound interface
   through network slice transport protocol, realizes these functions on
   the infrastructure.

5.2.  Enhanced Broadband

   Today, video consumes the largest amount of bandwidth over the
   Internet.  As the higher resolution formats enter mainstream, even
   more bandwidth will be needed to stream 4K/8K/360 degree formats.
   For example, connected Virtual Reality(VR)/Augmented Reality(AR) is
   the future use case of eMBB services.  Notably, media processing for
   AR/VR will require in-network processing functions and high latencies
   between components could lead to downgrade of user experience.
   Therefore, an AR/VR stream requires a special infrastructure that
   differs from best-effort network.

   A purpose-built network slice for eMBB streaming shall ensure to
   minimize processing overheads, it may be done by placement of network
   functions closer to subscribers.  Resource scaling for eMBB should be
   dynamic because bandwidth is expensive and such vertical service
   operators may not want to pay for unutilized bandwidth.  Therefore,
   slices should be able to monitor, negotiate and adjust the scale for
   both bandwidth and service functions.  Latency guarantees vary from
   general services, therefore, as a first step, monitoring for quality
   of service is needed and more advanced operation would involve
   recovery and reparation of paths.

   A typical eMBB slice Figure 6 from a network operator is a
   performance oriented service customization.  An eMBB service slice
   template will allow a tenant to request or specify

        function, from multiple access network types (cellular, fixed).

               Figure 7: Workflow of wireless sensor network

   Figure 7 shows, control of sensor data & behavior at scale, requiring
   wide area coverage and power constrained communication.  A few new
   types of scenarios that require unique infrastructure are:

   o  Smart city networks: an integration of several public
      infrastructures together through M2M communications.  For example
      Automatic metering (for gas, energy, water, etc.), environment
      monitoring (for pollution, temperature, humidity, etc.), traffic
      signal control etc.

   o  E-health communications that remote monitor the physical
      conditions (e.g., heart rate, pulse, blood pressure etc.), and
      accordingly take necessary measures remotely.  E-health
      communication network must be secure, reliable and fast but small-
      size of data exchange.

   mMTC Type Slices involves potentially a large number of small and
   power-constrained devices, therefore, resource allocation at scale is
   of particular importance in mMTC type slices.  Furthermore, different
   kind of IoT devices may exhibit delay sensitivity in industry
   operations etc.  The mMTC type slices should be conscious of
   requirements of scale, variable data pattern, and energy efficient
   communications.

6.2.  Ultra-reliable Low Latency Communication

   In uRLLC scenarios, data loss is not acceptable.  Both data and
   control planes may require significant enhancements to transmission
   or information distribution protocols.  [TR_3GPP_38.913] specifies
   access network user plane latency as 1ms and reliability factor of
   99.999% for transmission of a packet of size 32 bytes.  The slices of
   this type must be ensured that shared infrastructure absolutely does
   not cause any adverse effects.

   In the following sections three new uRLLC scenarios are described.

   (1)  Industrial operation: Operations in remote sites usually need
        combined support of cellular and transport network.  Operational
        accuracy is characterized by

        *  Low latency and low jitter in communication path

        *  Closed control loop (Sensor -Controller - Actuator) as shown
           in Figure 8, a typical control cycle time where network is
           involved should be below 10ms [Tactile-Internet].

   o  Locations of the access nodes for terminals (devices, vehicles) to
      the transport network and locations of the controller to construct
      its own network topology within the network slice.  In high
      mobility scenario such as automotive verticals, the dynamic
      topology adjustments are required without loss of data.

   o  Each service vertical has different performance requirements in
      terms of latency, reliability and data rate etc., therefore, the
      uRLLC network slice should allow customization for these
      parameters.

   o  A uRLLC service provider should be able to registers self with
      access rights to resource monitoring and negotiation loop.

   A network slice provider offers a uRLLC Slice with the following
   considerations

   o  Should support/provide specific data and control planes protocols
      with significant enhancements for deterministic latency and
      reliability (e.g.  DetNet[I-D.dt-detnet-dp-sol] in data plane).

   o  Allow uRLLC service operator to access user admission and
      authentication to its network slice in advance.

   o  The network coverage for a uRLLC service provisioning may be
      limited to a confined area, either indoor or outdoor, network
      operator needs to be able to coordinate resource allocation across
      different access types and network domains.

   A high-level Figure 9, shows a URLLC slice provider and service view
   of the network.  The monitoring of resources is done in the context
   of performance.  A performance degradation would require resource
   adjustment.  As shown in Figure 9, in one possible sliced model will
   have its own customizer that uses internal performance observing
   logic with in its slice by coordinating with different subnets/
   domains using southbound NS transport protocol and transfers this
   information to operator via a northbound NS protocol for resource
   adjustment.

   It is implied that domains maybe different access technologies and
   need for a common performance metric propagation and resource
   allocation is important for a uRLLC slice to function properly.

6.3.  Critical Communications

   Critical communications are associated with emergency situations.
   Often referred to as mission critical, the communication has to be
   reliable and non-disruptive.  Different scenarios of critical
   communications relate to public safety responders (e.g. fire
   fighters, paramedics), military, utility or commercial applications,




Makhijani, ed, et al.    Expires April 21, 2018                [Page 20]

Internet-Draft            Netslicing use cases              October 2017


   mainly using reliable voice or short data messaging over wireless
   communication systems.

   Next-generation public safety communications are planned to be built
   with enhanced broadband voice, data and video communications services
   beyond narrowband LMR with broadband LTE networks for high speed data
   (ref 22.179 and FirstNet).

   3GPP defined on-network critical communication can be established
   both via (a) over the network infrastructure to manage the call, (b)
   off-network, where the terminals communicate directly to each other.
   In the network slicing context, over the network, involves transport
   networks for an always available, reliable, and zero packet loss
   quality of traffic support to meet critical services requirements.

   Maintaining a separate broadband infrastructure for critical
   communications incurs a heavy deployment cost.  Especially, as the
   coverage of this separate network has to be extended to large-scale
   nationwide geographies and remain interoperable is too expensive.  As
   new communication technologies emerge, public safety systems will
   have to bear the state of the art adoption cost.  A separate
   infrastructure lacks flexibility to add new value-added services or
   to take advantage of available commercial services.

   While shared infrastructure, brings out challenges of these kind:

   (1)  Reliable support: Of basic mission critical services: Such as
        loss of information in voice communication is not acceptable in
        emergency services, if common infrastructure is to be used, it
        must assure no loss of information.

   (2)  Zero congestion: It is not acceptable for critical calls to be
        delayed at call setup times or be subjected to any other
        congestion scenarios.

   Having the Mission Critical Service (MCS) as a network slice benefit
   from the following:

   o  Insertion and authorization of subscribers in a group
      communication: In a critical infrastructure, the subscriber
      authentication may be done earlier at the entry point
      automatically through slice selection functional entity.

   o  Pre-allocated QoS Class Identifiers (QCIs): Generally, QCIs are
      requested on per session basis which could slow down overall call
      control setup and is undesirable for emergency services.  When
      operating in a slice, these resources maybe reserved ahead of time
      in a coarse-grained manner instead of per session.

Internet-Draft            Netslicing use cases              October 2017


   MCS network slices are relatively straight forward as it only
   concerns with guaranteed bit rate (GBR) on per media basis and
   management of groups.  From transport they should be able to request
   transport services based on GBR for reliable communication.  A
   reference network slice in Figure 10 below, shows a mission critical
   (MC) organization providing service agreement through a network slice
   template with resource specification.  The MCS slice sets up
   different subnetworks of different subscriber groups and manages its
   membership.  These subnets are realized into the infrastructure
   across different domains through a network slice transport mechanism.
   The MCS must be capable of active resource monitoring to prevent
   congestions to ever occur as well as request additional transport
   resources in case of emergency event occurrence.

7.  Network Infrastructure for new technologies

7.1.  ICN as a Network Slice

   ICN as in Information-Centric Networking is a culmination of multiple
   future Internet research efforts in various parts of the world, now
   being pursued under IRTF's research task group called [ICNRG].



Makhijani, ed, et al.    Expires April 21, 2018                [Page 23]

Internet-Draft            Netslicing use cases              October 2017


   Information-Centric Networking (ICN) addresses Internet's network
   architectural design gaps based on evolving applications requirements
   and end user behavior that is significantly different from what IP
   was designed for - which was optimized for host-to-host communication
   paradigm.  ICN is a non-IP paradigm based on name-based routing and
   offers many desirable networking features to applications such as
   naming, security, caching, mobility, multicasting and computing in a
   manner different from traditional host-centric communication model.
   ICN's name-based abstraction to application minimizes bootstrap
   configuration from the network, making it suitable to several
   communication modalities such as multi-point-to-multi-point, AR/VR,
   D2D and Ad hoc communication.

7.2.  New Verticals - ICN based service delivery

   Services over ICN slices can take advantage of its features such as:

   (1)  In ICN, applications, services and content are addressed using
        names, hence end host resolution services like DNS can be
        avoided, this achieves name resolution to edge content or
        services without incurring additional RTT delays.

   (2)  Service flows will be offered mobility and multicasting support,
        as the networking is session-less and optimized towards
        efficient movement of named data or networking named services
        and host level communication.

   (3)  Services can be deployed at the very edges with ease as ICN
        routers are compute friendly, this is because states in the
        forwarding table can be that of either content or service
        resources.

   (4)  Further saving bandwidth in the upstream link through
        opportunistic caching is an inherent feature of ICN, this also
        leads to energy efficient networking.

   When offered as a programmable and customizable logical network
   slice, ICN based services can be offered as a network slice in
   parallel with traditional IP based services.  ICN can be realized as
   a slice [_5GICN_] based on the choice of data plane resource offered
   by the operators in different domains of the network such as the
   access, core network or main data centers.  While the same resources
   can be used to support services over IP, proper resource isolation
   shall allow it to co-exist with ICN slices as well.  ICN slices can
   be offered over a network slicing framework built upon a programmable
   pool of software and/or hardware based data plane resources.

Internet-Draft            Netslicing use cases              October 2017


7.2.1.  Required Characteristics

   In ICN, applications use Interest/Data or Get/Put abstractions over
   named resources resolved by ICN's routing plane.  An ICN slice shall
   be a programmable ICN-domain, in which content learning and
   distribution will be done using existing or new ICN aware distributed
   routing logic or through centralized application controllers.  As a
   result, it should be possible to deploy software or hardware based
   network functions such as ICN routers and content producers and
   distributors that serve and speak ICN protocols, or enabled through
   service gateways at the edges of the network.  Just as multiple
   service instances can be part of a slice, an ICN slices can multiplex
   heterogeneous services; on the other hand an ICN slice can be as
   granular as a single service instance too.  The latter approach has
   implications with respect to consumer privacy, access control of name
   data objects, and granularity of mobility handling [_5GICN_].

   A basic ICN slice can be manifested as a resource isolated logical
   network while sharing resources with other connectivity or IP based
   service slices.  An ICN slice relies on programmability and
   virtualization framework to manage the service slices, to allow
   maximum flexibility through ICN aware logically centralized control
   plane for ICN service and slice management.

   o  Through a network slice template -ICN service providing entity
      could specify specific locations (edge of network domains) to
      deploy ICN-routers or other ICN-NFs (ICN aware network functions).
      Its service definition varies with the type of service.

   o  Application driven connectivity between ICN network elements in
      all segments and create an ICN based virtual topology.

   o  Mechanisms to deliver ICN user traffic over the infrastructure
      such as overlay or, ICN NFs can be tightly integrated with the RAN
      such as the eNodeB or implicitly using traffic classification
      function at the edge and tunneled to ICN User Plane Function
      (UPF).

   o  In addition, bandwidth and other network resources may be
      requested from the underlay depending on its capability of
      providing deterministic or statistically guarantees.

   How multiple services will be deployed within an ICN aware slice may
   or may not be exposed to the network operator, depending on if the
   ICN slices are natively managed by it or a by other service
   providers.

8.  Overall Use Case Analysis

   The discussion in above use cases can be summarized as following in
   terms of the requirements for network slicing framework.

8.1.  Requirements Reference

   The following functional requirements are derived from discussions in
   above sections.  They are described in details in
   [I-D.qiang-netslices-gap-analysis] document.

   The differentiated services described in this document demonstrate
   several common functionalities.  Therefore, a homogeneous approach
   towards deployment and management is absolutely necessary.

8.2.  Mapping Common characteristics to Requirements

   (1)  Resource Reservation: Compute and network resources are reserved
        as part of initial creation and subsequently during the
        maintenance of a slice.  For example, a service may initially
        reserve resources for its own control plane, and then later it
        may reserve user plane flows for applications on demand.
        Reference use cases: Differentiated services discussed in
        section "Services with Resource Assurance".  A network slice
        aware infrastructure shall be able to support mechanisms for
        elastic scaling (up/down) of resources and their non-disruptive
        provisioning.

   (2)  Resource Assurance: A network slice aware infrastructure allows
        operators to allocate part of the network resources to meet
        stringent resource characteristics.  Scenarios in both Section 5
        and Section 6 require on demand and dynamic adjustments.  It may
        not be possible to achieve this using centralize or API approach
        with finer granularity of resources participating in constrained
        path computation.

   (3)  Multi-dimensional service vertical: Network slicing supports
        dynamic multi-services, multi-tenancy and the means for backing
        vertical market players.

   (4)  Multi-domain coordination: Multi-domain refers to different
        technology related network domains.  For example, it may be RAN,
        DSL etc., mobile core network, ISP or different domains in
        transport networks such as carrier Ethernet, MPLS, TE-tunnel
        etc.  Often, they are under same administrator's control but may
        require coordination across different administrations.
        Furthoremore, capabilities of each domain must be known in order
        to validate if a slice can be created or not.  All scenarios



Makhijani, ed, et al.    Expires April 21, 2018                [Page 26]

Internet-Draft            Netslicing use cases              October 2017


        mentioned require multi-domain coordination to connect and
        administer different subnets.

   (5)  Operational Isolation: A network slice represents logical group
        of network resources, functions and corresponding configurations
        separating its behavior and hence operation from the underlying
        physical network.  Each network slice may have its own operator
        that sees this slice as a complete network (i.e. with router
        instances, policies, programmability, placement of virtual
        network functions according to traffic patterns etc.) and can
        manage as its own network.

   (6)  Transparency: Network slicing does not change the functionality
        of a scenario; It only facilitates creation of an isolated, an
        independently run infrastructure for that use case over a common
        network.  Transparency promotes inter-operability and a common
        resource specification enables it.

   (7)  Reliability: It is an important resource attribute in the type
        of service verticals described above.  Many services verticals
        cannot deliver functionality unless the network is reliable (See
        remote industry operation, remote surgery and other uRLLC
        applications).  In this regard, monitoring probes are needed of
        each network slice and resources associated with it.

         Figure 11: Mapping Common Characteristics to Requirements

   NSaaS is a key for network operators to deploy network slices.
   Having standard means to realize these use cases, enables (a)



Makhijani, ed, et al.    Expires April 21, 2018                [Page 27]

Internet-Draft            Netslicing use cases              October 2017


   different usecases to be uniformly understood by a network slice
   provider, and (b) similar use cases to be understood in a similar
   fashion by different network slice providers.  Both these cases
   should allow common mechanisms to map and allocate network slices
   over the network infrastructure.

   Due to the availability of diverse technologies in control and data
   planes; the first step should be a top-down means to realize a slice
   with a common technology independent information model.  It may
   describe a resource-centric slice with connectivity, storage, and
   compute resources, network functions, and operational requirements,
   that further get mapped to infrastructure resources and capabilities
   for run-time operations and monitoring.  This model may be used by an
   orchestrator onboarding function for creating instances of network
   slice services and distributing to network infrastructure providers.

9.  Conclusion

   A service should typically need a network slice for one of those
   reasons:

   (1)  The service cannot provide optimal experience on a best-effort
        network.

   (2)  It is inefficient and expensive to build a separate
        infrastructure.

   The separation from a generalized network, should allow new services
   to use newer or different protocols in network, transport and
   management layer/plane for that service (as in the case of ICN, mMTC,
   uRLL).  The goal of Network slices is to offer enriched service
   verticals with very different network capability and performance
   demands but also simplify from the traditional service delivery
   models.

   There is need for a uniform framework for end to end network slicing
   specifications that spans across multiple technology domains and can
   drive extensions in those technolgy-areas for support of Network
   slices.

10.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations apply to each kind of slice.  In addition
   general security considerations of underlying infrastructure whether
   isolated communication with in a slice apply for links using wireless
