                         IPv6 Path MTU Updates
                   draft-generic-6man-tunfrag-03.txt

Abstract

   IPv6 intentionally deprecates fragmentation by routers in the
   network.  Instead, links with restricting MTUs must either drop each
   too-large packet and return an ICMP Packet Too Big message or perform
   link-specific fragmentation (also known as "link adaptation") at a
   layer below IPv6.  This latter category of links is often
   performance-challenged to accommodate steady-state link-specific
   fragmentation and reassembly to the point that it would be highly
   desirable to push the workload back to the IPv6 communication
   endpoints.  A common case that exhibits these link characteristics is
   seen for IPv6-within-IP tunnels.  Additionally, IPv6 nodes could
   better adapt to path MTUs of various sizes by using either a small
   amount of host-based fragmentation and/or path probing as
   necessary.This document therefore proposes an update to the base IPv6
   specification to better accommodate path MTU issues.

Internet-Draft            IPv6 Path MTU Updates                July 2012


1.  Introduction

   IPv6 intentionally deprecates fragmentation by routers in the
   network.  Instead, links with restricting MTUs must either drop each
   too-large packet and return an ICMP Packet Too Big message or perform
   link-specific fragmentation (also known as "link adaptation") at a
   layer below IPv6.  This latter category of links is often
   performance-challenged to accommodate steady-state link-specific
   fragmentation and reassembly to the point that it would be highly
   desirable to push the workload back to the IPv6 communication
   endpoints.  A common case that exhibits these link characteristics is
   seen for IPv6-within-IP tunnels [I-D.generic-v6ops-tunmtu].
   Additionally, IPv6 nodes could better adapt to path MTUs of various
   sizes by using either a small amount of host-based fragmentation
   and/or path probing as necessary.  This document therefore proposes
   an update to the base IPv6 specification to better accommodate path
   MTU issues.


2.  Problem Statement

   The current "Internet cell size" is effectively 1500 bytes, i.e., the
   minimum MTU configured by the vast majority of links in the Internet.
   However, due to issues with Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) this size can
   often only be accommodated when links with smaller link-layer segment
   sizes are permitted to perform link adaptation.  A common example of
   such links is seen for IPv6-within-IP tunnels.  For those links, the
   tunnel ingress can perform fragmentation on the outer packet
   following encapsulation and can instead (or in addition) perform
   "tunnel fragmentation" via an encapsulation mid-layer inserted
   between the inner and outer header.  In both cases reassembly would
   be performed by the tunnel egress.

   Unfortunately, link-layer fragmentation can present a significant
   burden to the link endpoints, i.e., especially when the link supports
   high data rates and/or is located nearer the "middle" of the network
   instead of nearer the "edge".  The third alternative therefore is to
   ask the original IPv6 source to perform fragmentation on the packet
   before sending it out, in which case reassembly would be performed by
   the final destination.  This document therefore updates the IPv6
   protocol specification [RFC2460] to better accommodate paths with
   various MTUs as described in the following sections.


3.  Considerations for Small MTU Paths

   Section 5 of [RFC2460] states:

   "IPv6 requires that every link in the internet have an MTU of 1280
   octets or greater.  On any link that cannot convey a 1280-octet
   packet in one piece, link-specific fragmentation and reassembly must
   be provided at a layer below IPv6."

   This document does not propose to change this requirement, but notes
   that link-specific fragmentation can be burdensome for some links
   (e.g., IPv6-within-IP tunnels), to the point that it would be highly
   desirable for the fragmentation and reassembly to be offloaded to the
   communication endpoints.  In order to accommodate this, when the
   router at the link ingress performs link adaptation on a packet it
   should also send an advisory ICMPv6 Packet Too Big (PTB) message back
   to the original source (subject to rate limiting).  This document
   therefore proposes to add the following specification as a new final
   paragraph to the end of Section 5:

   "In response to an IPv6 packet that is sent to an IPv6 destination
   located beyond a link that must perform link-specific fragmentation,
   the originating IPv6 node may receive an ICMP Packet Too Big message
   reporting a Next-Hop MTU less than 1280.  In that case, the IPv6 node
   should perform IPv6 fragmentation on any subsequent packets that are
   larger than this MTU value but no larger than 1500 bytes.  Note that
   these Packet Too Big messages are advisory in nature and do not
   necessarily indicate packet loss."

   An example tunnel protocol that invokes this new clause appears in:
   [I-D.templin-intarea-seal].


4.  Considerations for Medium MTU Paths

   Regardless of whether there is a link that performs link adaptation
   in the path, when an original source receives a PTB message reporting
   a Next-Hop MTU value no smaller than 1280 but smaller than 1500, the
   source need not reduce the size of the packets it sends but may
   instead invoke fragmentation for packets no larger than 1500 bytes
   with a maximum fragment size set to 1280 bytes.  These fragments will
   be reassembled by the final destination, which is required by
   [RFC2460] to configure a minimum reassembly buffer size of 1500
   bytes.


5.  Considerations for Large MTU Paths

   An original source connected to a link that supports an MTU no
   smaller than 1500 bytes is permitted to send packets no larger than
   this MTU without fragmentation, but for packet sizes larger than 1500
   bytes should implement [RFC4821] to ensure that the large packets are

   reaching the final destination.


6.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations for this document.


7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for [RFC2460] apply also to this
   document.
