Abstract 

   This document proposes an IP multicast fast reroute method based on 
   differentiating primary and backup PIM join.  The multicast stream 
   is only sent along one of the multicast primary and backup path, 
   which enables the efficient multicast delivery under both normal and 
   abnormal conditions.

1. Introduction 

   This document proposes an IP multicast fast reroute method based on 
   differentiating primary and backup PIM join, which is called Single 
   Stream multicast FRR.  In this method, two multicast forwarding 
   paths are established respectively by PIM primary join and backup 
   join.  Under normal conditions, only primary path is used to make 
   the multicast data delivery.  If the node or link on the primary 
   path fails, the multicast data forwarding is switched to the backup 
   path. 

   Because either primary or backup nodes forward multicast data 
   packets, they should be able to identify on which path they are 
   located to make appropriate forwarding decision.  One feasible 
   solution is to include a new join attribute in a PIM backup join 
   message to set up backup multicast path whose entries are disabled 
   by default.  If a failure is detected on the primary path, the 
   backup nodes are notified and the entries which were previously 
   disabled are enabled for multicast data forwarding.  

   The Single stream FRR solution has the advantages of implementing 
   fast multicast protection and of avoiding double multicast bandwidth 
   occupation in both normal and abnormal situations. 

2. Principle of Single Stream Solution 

2.1. Primary and Backup Path Setup 

   The backup multicast path is set up using backup PIM join.  The join 
   is sent by the initiating node (i.e. the downstream converge point 
   of primary and backup paths) from a backup IP FRR upstream interface 
   or from a statically configured backup interface towards the 
   multicast source.  The join is transmitted hop-by-hop upwards and is 
   terminated when reaching the root of the multicast tree (i.e. Source 
   DR or RP), or when merging with primary forwarding states created by 
   primary join.  On the merging point, only the primary states are 
   maintained. 

   The forwarding state(s) on backup path are disabled by default for 
   data forwarding when being created by the backup joins, which 
   requires the backup join to be flagged to be differentiated from the 
   primary ones.  A new join attribute [RFC5384] (referred to as e.g. 
   Multicast FRR join Attribute, or MFA), is suggested to be introduced 
   to serve this purpose and a new hello option for this attribute 
   should be defined to negotiate this capability.  The format of the

   attribute and its hello option are respectively defined in section 
   3.1 and 3.2 

   The establishing of primary path could be a normal PIM join process.  
   In this case an ordinary PIM join is generated on the initiating 
   node of primary path and is sent hop-by-hop upstream until the join 
   arrives at the root of the tree or at the other valid forwarding 
   branch. 

2.2. Fault Processing 

   The fault on the primary path could be detected by using some fault 
   detection mechanism (e.g. BFD protocol), which is configured to be 
   run between each pair of PIM neighbors.  If error condition occurs, 
   the node on the upstream or downstream of the error point will 
   possibly detect it and should pass this error condition to the 
   backup path, and enable multicast data forwarding on it. 

   As the node on the primary path detects a failure, it could choose 
   to flood the failure notification packet to all its PIM neighbors 
   until all the PIM routers in the area get the notification.  To 
   prevent excessive transmission of these packets, the sending and 
   forwarding of the packets should be rate-limited.  There are other 
   options such as setting up special fault notification tree with 
   reserved multicast address and etc. 

   After the enabling of the backup path triggered by the fault 
   notification, the multicast data will be forwarded along the backup 
   path to the initiating node of the backup path.  The initiating 
   point will change the backup incoming interface (IIF) as its RPF 
   interface if no data is available from the primary IIF. 

2.3. Fault Recovery 

   If primary path heals, multicast forwarding could choose to switch 
   back to the primary path.  Once the data is received from the 
   primary IIF, the initiating node will change its RPF interface to 
   its primary IIF.  The node may also send a PIM prune message to tear 
   down the backup path, and may possibly after waiting for a specified 
   period of time, re-setup the backup path without stream using the 
   same process as described in section 2.1.

3. The Definition of packet format  

3.1. Multicast FRR join Attribute 

   The format of the join attribute is defined as: 

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |F|E| Attr_Type |    Length     |     Flags     |   Path Count  | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |                            Path   ID                          | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   ~                              . . .                            ~ 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |                            Path   ID                          | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
    
   - F-bit, Transitive Attribute.  If this bit is set, the attribute is 
   a transitive attribute; otherwise, it is a non-transitive attribute 
   [RFC5384]. 

   - E-bit, End of Attributes.  If this bit is set, then this is the 
   last Join Attribute appearing in the Encoded-Source Address field 
   specified by [RFC5384]. 

   - Attr_Type, Type of the Attribute. It should be set to a new value 
   (e.g.) for this MFA join attribute, e.g., taking value of 8. 

   - Length, a 1-octet field specifying the length in octets, encoded 
   as an unsigned binary integer, of the value field. 

   - Flags, flags for the methods of setting up of primary or backup 
   paths.  For the rightmost bit, 0 is for a primary join, 1 for backup 
   join.  Other bits are reserved for the future definition. 

   - Path Count, the number of Path ID. 

   - Path ID, the Identification for this path.  It may be an interface 
   ID or a logical number to identify a primary path. 

3.2. PIM multicast FRR Hello Options 

   This multicast FRR Hello options are used for the PIM neighbors to 
   negotiate the capability of multicast FRR join attribute.  It has 
   the format prescribed in [RFC5384] and the OptionType is defined a 
   new value representing this MFA attribute.

4. Single Stream Implementation Options 

4.1. Disabling all nodes on backup path 

   In this method, when backup join is transmitted to set up the backup 
   path, the forwarding states of all backup nodes are by default 
   disabled for multicast data forwarding when being created.  When 
   backup join arrives at a primary node that has primary forwarding 
   state, it is ''absorbed'' and will not create any backup state there.  
   Because each node on the backup path could be disabled or enabled 
   for data forwarding, it is possible to implement relatively precise 
   control of path switching. 

               RT1                                |     | 
              /                                  RT1 - RT2 
             RT2                                 /       \ 
             |   \                              RT3       RT4 
            RT3   RT4                           \         /   
           /   \  /                              RT5  - RT6         
         RT5    RT6                                           
                                                                 
           Figure 1                               Figure 2  
    
   Figure 1 is an example of an arbitrary tree topology.  Supposing RT6 
   has a downstream receiver and it is the initiating node of both the 
   primary and backup path for this receiver.  RT2-RT3-RT6 is setup as 
   the primary path by primary join, and RT2-RT4-RT6 as the backup path 
   by backup join.  The backup forwarding entries for the backup path, 
   i.e. the outgoing interfaces of RT2 (the one towards RT4) and RT4 
   (towards RT6), are all disabled for multicast forwarding.  Only 
   primary path imports multicast stream through RT2 to RT6 and to the 
   receiver. 

   If link between RT3 and RT6 goes down, the failure will be detected 
   by RT6.  The fault notification will be generated by RT6 and be

Internet-Draft       Single Stream Multicast FRR          October 2010 
    

   notified to RT4 and RT2 on backup path, by flooding or through fault 
   multicast tree which is pre-established on RT4 and RT2 by back join 
   with RT6 as the source of the tree  The nodes RT4 and RT2 will be 
   enabled the data forwarding on their outgoing interfaces, and the 
   data will be imported from RT2, through RT4, to RT6 and the receiver. 

   In the ring topology shown in figure 2, supposing RT3 has a receiver 
   downstream, the primary path for it is RT1-RT3 and takes the duty of 
   data forwarding.  The backup path is RT2-RT4-RT6-RT5-RT3 and the 
   backup outgoing interface on each of them is disabled when the 
   forwarding state is created.  If node RT1 undergos failure, it will 
   be detected by RT3 and be notified by flooding or by multicast fault 
   tree which is pre-established on RT5, RT6, RT4, and RT2, with RT3 as 
   the source of the tree.  After enabling data forwarding for these 
   nodes, the traffic will be delivered along backup path to RT3 and to 
   the receiver.  Each node on the ring processes in the similar manner, 
   if it has downstream multicast receiver.  If any upstream failure on 
   the primary path occurs, the node will turn to receive reverse 
   stream from the backup path. 

   Because a backup node or path might provide protection for more than 
   one primary path, the identification of the primary path should be 
   bound to its own backup multicast entries, which requires the 
   identification to be carried in the backup join during setting up of 
   backup path, and in the fault notification to enable the forwarding 
   of these entries. 

   In normal cases, a primary path is identified by the primary IIF ID 
   of an initiating node.  In figure 1, this ID is the upstream 
   interface ID of RT6 towards RT3.  Its correlation with backup 
   forwarding entries are maintained at RT4 and RT2.  The backup path 
   RT2-RT4-RT6 is used to protect failure detected by RT6 (i.e. RT3 
   node failure or RT3-RT6 link failure).  To provide protection for 
   the whole primary network, each primary node is required to have a 
   backup interface to form disjoint backup path for the upstream node/ 
   link to be protected, which is generally the case for ring topology 
   and dual-homing protection tree topology. 

   As an extension, the primary ID could also be the collection of all 
   interface IDs of a primary path (i.e. upstream interface IDs of RT3 
   and RT6 in figure 1), which could be configured on the initiating 
   point (i.e. RT6) and be carried in backup join.  The fault 
   notification still carries the interface ID of downstream detecting 
   node.  Because the backup path is set up according to the interface 
   ID collection for the whole primary path, one backup path can

Internet-Draft       Single Stream Multicast FRR          October 2010 
    

   provide protection for a complete primary path (i.e. RT2-RT3-RT6), 
   rather than for only one hop distance in the former case. 

4.2. Disabling only root node on backup path 

   In this method, when backup join is sent to setup the backup path, 
   only the root node is disabled of its multicast data forwarding.  
   The forwarding states on other nodes on the backup path are kept 
   normal.  In normal condition, the only stream comes from the primary 
   path established by the primary join.  If error occurs on the 
   primary path, the root node of the backup path is notified of the 
   failure, it then enables its data forwarding and the data stream 
   will be delivered from the backup path to the receiver.   

   Because only the ingress node of the backup path is disabled, the 
   method requires the backup path not to intersect with the primary 
   path for the intermediate nodes and can be applied to multiple tree 
   topologies.  E.g., the primary join and backup join can be used to 
   setup primary and backup trees with only primary tree makes the 
   multicast forwarding in normal condition.  When failure occurs on 
   the primary tree, the root node of the backup tree could be notified 
   to open its data forwarding and the multicast data will delivered 
   over the backup tree to the receiver.

   They will be described in the later version of this draft.
