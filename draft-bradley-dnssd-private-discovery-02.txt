1.  Introduction

   Advertising and discovering devices and services on the network can
   leak a lot of information about a device or person, such as their
   name, the types of services they provide or use, and persistent
   identifiers.  This information can be used to identify and track a
   person's location and daily routine (e.g. buys coffee every morning
   at 8 AM at Starbucks on Main Street).  It can also reveal intimate
   details about a person's behavior and medical conditions, such as
   discovery requests for a glucose monitor, possibly indicating
   diabetes.

   This document specifies a system for advertising and discovery of
   devices and services while preserving privacy and confidentiality.

   This document does not specify how keys are provisioned.
   Provisioning keys is complex enough to justify its own document(s).
   This document assumes each peer has a long-term asymmetric key pair
   (LTPK and LTSK) and communicating peers have each other's long-term
   asymmetric public key (LTPK).

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   "Friend"
      A peer you have a cryptographic relationship with.  Specifically,
      that you have the peer's LTPK.

   "Probe"
      Unsolicited multicast message sent to find friends on the network.

   "Announcement"
      Unsolicited multicast message sent to inform friends on the
      network that you have become available or have updated data.

   "Response"
      Solicited unicast message sent in response to a probe or
      announcement.

   "Query"
      Unsolicited unicast message sent to get specific info from a peer.

   "Answer"
      Solicited unicast message sent in response to a query to provide
      info or indicate the lack of info.

   "Multicast"
      This term is used in the generic sense of sending a message that
      targets 0 or more peers.  It's not strictly required to be a UDP
      packet with a multicast destination address.  It could be sent via
      TCP or some other transport to a router that repeats the message
      via unicast to each peer.

   "Unicast"
      This term is used in the generic sense of sending a message that
      targets a single peer.  It's not strictly required to be a UDP
      packet with a unicast destination address.

   Multi-byte values are encoded from the most significant byte to the
   least significant byte (big endian).

   When multiple items are concatenated together, the symbol "||"
   (without quotes) between each item is used to indicate this.  For
   example, a combined item of A followed by B followed by C would be
   written as "A || B || C".

3.  Protocol

   There are two techniques used to preserve privacy and provide
   confidentiality in this document.  The first is announcing, probing,
   and responding with only enough info to allow a peer with your public
   key to detect that it's you while hiding your identity from peers
   without your public key.  This technique uses a fresh random signed
   with your private key using a signature algorithm that doesn't reveal
   your public key.  The second technique is to query and answer in a
   way that only a specific friend can read the data.  This uses
   ephemeral key exchange and symmetric encryption and authentication.

   The general flow of the protocol is a device sends multicast probes
   to discover friend devices on the network.  If friend devices are
   found, it directly communicates with them via unicast queries and
   answers.  Announcements are sent to report availability and when
   services are added or removed.

3.1.  Probe

   A probe is sent via multicast to discover friends on the network.  A
   probe contains a fresh, ephemeral public key (EPK1), a timestamp
   (TS1), and a signature (SIG1).  This provides enough for a friend to
   identify the source, but doesn't allow non-friends to identify it.

   Probe Fields:

   o  EPK1 (Ephemeral Public Key 1).

   o  TS1 (Timestamp 1).  See Timestamps Section 4.

   o  SIG1 (Signature of "Probe" || EPK1 || TS1 || "End").

   When a peer receives a probe, it verifies TS1.  If TS1 is outside the
   time window then it SHOULD be ignored.  It then attempts to verify
   SIG1 with the public key of each of its friends.  If verification
   fails for all public keys then it ignores the probe.  If a
   verification succeeds for a public key then it knows which friend
   sent the probe.  It SHOULD send a response to the friend.

3.2.  Response

   A response contains a fresh, ephemeral public key (EPK2) and a
   symmetrically encrypted signature (ESIG2).  The encryption key is
   derived by first generating a fresh ephemeral public key (EPK2) and
   its corresponding secret key (ESK2) and performing Diffie-Hellman
   (DH) using EPK1 and ESK2 to compute a shared secret.  The shared
   secret is used to derive a symmetric session key (SSK2).  A signature



Bradley                  Expires April 20, 2020                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                                              October 2019


   of the payload is generated (SIG2) using the responder's long-term
   secret key (LTSK2).  The signature is encrypted with SSK2 (ESIG2).
   The nonce for ESIG2 is 1 and is not included in the response.  The
   response is sent via unicast to the sender of the probe.

   When the friend that sent the probe receives the response, it
   performs DH, symmetrically verifies ESIG2 and, if successful,
   decrypts it to reveal SIG2.  It then tries to verify SIG2 with the
   public keys of all of its friends.  If a verification succeeds for a
   public key then it knows which friend sent the response.  If any
   steps fail, the response is ignored.  If all steps succeed, it
   derives a session key (SSK1).  Both session keys (SSK1 and SSK2) are
   remembered for subsequent communication with the friend.

   Response Fields:

   o  EPK2 (Ephemeral Public Key 2).

   o  ESIG2 (Encrypted Signature of "Response" || EPK2 || EPK1 || TS1 ||
      "End").

   Key Derivation values:

   o  SSK1: HKDF-SHA-512 with Salt = "SSK1-Salt", Info = "SSK1-Info",
      Output size = 32 bytes.

   o  SSK2: HKDF-SHA-512 with Salt = "SSK2-Salt", Info = "SSK2-Info",
      Output size = 32 bytes.

3.3.  Announcement

   An announcement indicates availability to friends on the network or
   if it has update(s).  It is sent whenever a device joins a network
   (e.g. joins WiFi, plugged into Ethernet, etc.), its IP address
   changes, or when it has an update for one or more of its services.
   Announcements are sent via multicast.

   Announcement Fields:

   o  EPK1 (Ephemeral Public Key 1).

   o  TS1 (Timestamp 1).  See Timestamps Section 4.

   o  SIG1 (Signature of "Announcement" || EPK1 || TS1 || "End").

   When a peer receives an announcement, it verifies TS1.  If TS1 is
   outside the time window then it SHOULD be ignored.  It then attempts
   to verify SIG1 with the public key of each of its friends.  If

   verification fails for all public keys then it ignores the probe.  If
   a verification succeeds for a public key then it knows which friend
   sent the announcement.

3.4.  Query

   A query is sent via unicast to request specific info from a friend.
   The query data (MSG1) is encrypted with the symmetric session key
   (SSK1 for the original prober or SSK2 for the original responder) for
   the target friend previously generated via the probe/response
   exchange.  This encrypted field is EMSG1.  The nonce for EMSG1 is 1
   larger than the last nonce used with this symmetric key and is not
   included in the query.  For example, if this is the first message
   sent to this friend after the probe/response then the nonce would be
   2.  The query is sent via unicast to the friend.

   When the friend receives a query, it symmetrically verifies EMSG1
   against every active session's key and, if one is successful (which
   also identifies the friend), it decrypts the field.  If verification
   fails, the query is ignored, If verification succeeds, the query is
   processed.

   Query Fields:

   o  EMSG1 (Encrypted query data).

3.5.  Answer

   An answer is sent via unicast in response to a query from a friend.
   The answer data (MSG2) is encrypted with the symmetric session key of
   the destination friend (SSK1 it was the original prober or SSK2 if it
   was the original responder from the previous probe/response
   exchange).  This encrypted field is EMSG2.  The nonce for EMSG2 is 1
   larger than the last nonce used with this symmetric key and is not
   included in the answer.  For example, if this is the first message
   sent to this friend after the probe/response then the nonce would be
   2.  The answer is sent via unicast to the friend.

   When the friend receives an answer, it symmetrically verifies EMSG2
   against every active session's key and, if one is successful (which
   also identifies the friend), it decrypts the field.  If verification
   fails, the answer is ignored, If verification succeeds, the answer is
   processed.

   Answer Fields:

   o  EMSG2 (Encrypted answer data).

4.  Timestamps

   A timestamp in this document is the number of seconds since
   2001-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.  Timestamps sent in messages SHOULD be
   randomized by +/- 30 seconds to reduce the fingerprinting ability of
   observers.  A timestamp of 0 means the sender doesn't know the
   current time (e.g. lacks a battery-backed RTC and access to an NTP
   server).  Receivers MAY use a timestamp of 0 to decide whether to
   enforce time window restrictions.  This can allow discovery in
   situations where one or more devices don't know the current time
   (e.g. location without Internet access).

   A timestamp is considered valid if it's within N seconds of the
   current time of the receiver.  The RECOMMENDED value of N is 900
   seconds (15 minutes) to allow peers to remain discoverable even after
   a large amount of clock drift.

5.  Implicit Nonces

   The nonces in this document are integers that increment by 1 for each
   encryption.  Nonces are never included in any message.  Including
   nonces in messages would enable transactions to be easily tracked by
   following nonce 1, 2, 3, etc.  This may seem futile if other layers
   of the system also leak trackable identifiers, such as IP addresses,
   but those problems can be solved by other documents.  Random nonces
   could avoid tracking, but make replay protection difficult by
   requiring the receiver to remember previously received messages to
   detect a replay.

   One issue with implicit nonces and replay protection in general is
   handling lost messages.  Message loss and reordering is expected and
   shouldn't cause complete failure.  Accepting nonces within N of the
   expected nonce enables recovery from some loss and reordering.  When
   a message is received, the expected nonce is checked first and then
   nonce + 1, nonce - 1, up to nonce +/- N.  The RECOMMENDED value of N
   is 8 as a balance between privacy, robustness, and performance.

6.  Re-keying and Limits

   Re-keying is a hedge against key compromise.  The underlying
   algorithms have limits that far exceed reasonable usage (e.g. 96-bit
   nonces), but if a key was revealed then we want to reduce the damage
   by periodically re-keying.

   Probes are periodically re-sent with a new ephemeral public key in
   case the previous key pair was compromised.  The RECOMMENDED maximum
   probe ephemeral public key lifetime is 20 hours.  This is close to 1
   day since people often repeat actions on a daily basis, but with some

Internet-Draft                                              October 2019


   leeway for natural variations.  If a probe ephemeral public key is
   re-generated for other reasons, such as joining a WiFi network, the
   refresh timer is reset.

   Session keys are periodically re-key'd in case a symmetric key was
   compromised.  The RECOMMENDED maximum session key lifetime is 20
   hours or 1000 messages, whichever comes first.  This uses the same
   close-to-a-day reasoning as probes, but adds a maximum number of
   messages to reduce the potential for exposure when many messages are
   being exchanged.  Responses SHOULD be throttled if it appears that a
   peer is making an excessive number of requests since this may
   indicate the peer is probing for weaknesses (e.g. timing attacks,
   ChopChop-style attacks).

      the hash function.

   o  Randoms and randomization MUST use cryptographic random numbers.

   Information leaks may still be possible in some situations.  For
   example, an attacker could capture probes from a peer they've
   identified and replay them elsewhere within the allowed timestamp
   window.  This could be used to determine if a friend of that friend
   is present on that network.

   The network infrastructure may leak identifiers in the form of
   persistent IP addresses and MAC addresses.  Mitigating this requires
   changes at lower levels of the network stack, such as periodically
   changing IP addresses and MAC addresses.

9.  IANA Considerations

   The TLV and message types defined by this document are intended to be
   managed by IANA.

10.  To Do

   The following are some of the things that still need to be specified
   and decided:

   o  Figure out how sleep proxies might work with this protocol.

   o  Define probe and announcement random delays to reduce collisions.

   o  Describe when to use the same EPK2 in a response to reduce churn
      on probe/response collisions.

   o  Consider randomly answering probes for non-friends to mask real
      friends.

   o  Design public service protocol to allow pairing.
