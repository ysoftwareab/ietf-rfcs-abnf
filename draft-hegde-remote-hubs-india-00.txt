Abstract

   This document describes the goals of having remote hubs and documents
   the experiences of organising remote hubs in India.  It documents the
   experiences and suggest a possible framework for organising remote
   hubs in India.  Remote participation has become easier with jabber
   rooms and audio streaming initially to now real-time video
   interaction.

1.  Introduction

   Remote hubs enable participaton without being physically at the
   meeting.  Over the years, tools for IETF remote participation have
   become better.  Starting with jabber and audio streaming initially,
   It has improved a lot and it is now possible to present remote using
   meetecho tools as well by providing enough notice to the meetecho
   team.

2.  What is a remote hub ?

   A remote hub is place where two or more people who are interested in
   the IETF gather and participate in the proceedings of the IETF.
   Proceedings in this context can mean seeing the presentations in a WG
   or presenting in a working group or attending any of the plenaries of
   the IETF.  A remote hub can be set in someone one's home or office
   meeting room or some meeting room of a college or some other
   convenient place where people can congregate and discuss drafts,
   implementations and other issues related to the IETF.  There can be
   multiple remote hubs in the same country and even the same city as
   long as there are interested people in hosting and participating in
   the IETF.

3.  Why attend or host a remote hub ?

   A remote hub is way for interested participants to come together and
   discuss drafts, implemntations and standards realted to the IETF.
   They are extension of the physical meeting in the IETF.  Many times
   people cannot go to the IETF due to time, work or financial
   constraints.  Also someone might be new to standards or unsure if
   they can participate in the IETF.  Often academicians, ptotocol and
   software implementors and network engineers fall into these category.

   Subscribing to the mailing lists and meeting up with the local
   network standards enthusiasts is a good way to initiate people into
   the community.  It also serves as a good way to network and learn
   from senior and more experienced people in the community about IETF
   structure and rules (written and unwritten).  Often, local hubs might
   have an interesting perspective to add to conversations eg. protocol
   security in authoritation governments, internationalisation of names
   and identifiers, performance of protocols in low-bandwidth or high-
   delay networks.  Some of these perspectives might be underepresented
   in the IETF and remote hubs is a good way to include them in the
   conversation to make more robust, interoperable and scalable
   protocols.

   For commercial organsiation, hosting remote is a great way to
   facilitate engagement with the larger local as well as international
   community.  It is also a great way to attract talent and showcase new
   technology to startups and students.  Since IETF often works on new
   and upcoming technology especially in the applications layers such as
   WebRTC, HTTP/2.0 or websockets, it is a good way to test and gather
   feedback about specific implementations.  For academic instituions,
   it is a great way for getting students involved in open source
   contributions and implementations of open standard and help them in
   understanding real world sceanrios of deployment of technology.  For
   eg, the BCP series of RFCs document best current practices from real
   world experience.

4.  Organisation of Remote Hub

   Most of the time, hosting or attending an IETF remote hub does not
   require much.  You just need a comforatble space to follow
   discussions, a projector if it is a mid-sized or large group and a
   good high-speed network connection.  More details follow in the
   sections below.

4.1.  Mentors and Facilitators

   Often the people attending the remote hub are new to the IETF (either
   to the IETF itself or to the subject matter of the Working Group).
   In such cases, having a facilitator who describes past work in the
   IETF (earlier drafts or RFCs or discussion/debates) might help give
   context to newer partcipantsin the working group.  IT is also a good
   idea to mail the partcipants beforehand to check the agenda and ask
   them to read the drafts to be discussed at the meeting and if
   possible to follow the discussion on the mailing lists or read the
   archives.

4.2.  Meeting Room

   The meeting rooms should be comfortable and should have enough
   seating space for people signed up for the remote hub.  In case of
   more than 5-6 people, it is good to have a signup page to estimate
   einterest, especially if people outside the organsation hosting the
   remote hub are interested.  Please post directions to the venue and
   rooms well in advance in a meetup group or website so people know
   about the remote hub.

4.3.  Equipment requirements

   A good internet connection (> 2Mbps) would be useful especially if
   there is video through meetecho.  Please test the connection (for
   latency and bandwidth requirements) based on the meetecho link
   provided on the agenda page. if there are more than 3-4 people, you
   might also want to have a projectors and a microphone attached to the
   computer used to relay the discussion so people can participate in
   the WG.  Also test the connection with the meetecho person in the WG
   room just before the WG meeting commences by giving them enough
   notice.

5.  IETF central support of remote hubs

5.1.  Web site

   The IETF provides a wiki for every physical meeting of the IETF.
   There is a wiki link on that page that notes the remote hubs
   available for people to join in.  This is not meant to be exhaustive
   but is indicate of the various remote hubs in various regiosn for
   specific WGs.

5.2.  Email lists

   Currently there is no mailing list for remote hubs.  It is generally
   a good idea to announce the remote hub on the WG mailing list so
   other people from the region who are interested can join in.  It is
   alsoa good idea to let the WG chair know about the remote hub
   partcipating in the WG.

5.3.  Regional hosts

   There can potentially be regular recurring hosts for certain WGs and
   regions.

6.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations.

7.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations.
