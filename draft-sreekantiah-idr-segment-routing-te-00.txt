          Segment Routing Traffic Engineering Policy using BGP
              draft-sreekantiah-idr-segment-routing-te-00

Abstract

   This document describes mechanisms allowing advertising Segment
   Routing Traffic Engineering (SRTE) policies using BGP.  Through the
   mechanisms described in this document, a BGP speaker has the ability
   to trigger, in a remote BGP node, the setup of a SR Encapsulation
   policy with specific characteristics and an explicit path.  Steering
   mechanisms are also defined to enable the application of the policy
   on a per BGP route basis.

Internet-Draft     Segment Routing TE Policy using BGP      October 2015


1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) technology leverages the source routing and
   tunneling paradigms.  [I-D.filsfils-rtgwg-segment-routing] provides
   an introduction to SR architecture.  As defined in the SR
   architecture draft, "Node-SID" and "Adjacency-SID" denote Node
   Segment Identifier and Adjacency Segment Identifier respectively.

   [I-D.sivabalan-pce-segment-routing] introduced the notion of a
   segment routed TE path which may may not follow IGP SPT.  In this
   draft, we provide for the definition of SR Encapsulation Policy which
   can be used to provision such a segment routed TE path using BGP and
   the corresponding steering mechanism.  SR Encapsulation Policy
   (referred to as SR policy in the rest of the document) is defined to
   be a weighted-ECMP set of segment lists that are added on the packets
   steered on the SR Encapsulation policy.  Steering onto an SR
   Encapsulation Policy involves the classification of packets for
   encapsulation into the specified SR encapsulation policy

   Border Gateway protocol (BGP) can also be used in order to propagate
   SR policy and corresponding steering associated with BGP routes.
   This document describes extensions to BGP in order to achieve this.
   This document describes the mechanisms through which a BGP speaker
   (which can be either a router or a controller) advertises an SR
   policy in the form of a weighted-ECMP set of segment lists that will
   result, in the node receiving the SR policy advertisement, in the
   instantiation of a segment routed TE path.  Traffic steering onto the
   TE path is realized through the use of route coloring (based on BGP
   extended community Color attribute)

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Segment Routing Encapsulation SAFI

   A new Subsequent Address Family Identifier is defined, 'SR
   Encapsulation SAFI' (codepoint to be assigned by IANA).  The new SAFI
   will encode SR policy parameters in order to instantiate the SR
   policy on the receiving BGP speakers.  Specifically the NLRI
   associated with the SAFI will carry the ERO attribute, specifying a
   weighted set of explicit segment identifier lists (SID lists)
   representing the explicit SR TE path to the endpoint address encoded
   with the NLRI.

Internet-Draft     Segment Routing TE Policy using BGP      October 2015


   The NLRI, defined below, is carried in a BGP UPDATE message[RFC4271]
   using BGP multiprotocol extensions [RFC4760] with an AFI of 1 or 2
   (IPv4 or IPv6) [IANA-AF] and a SAFI value to be assigned by the IANA
   (suggested value 80).

   The NLRI is encoded in a format defined in Section 5 of [RFC4760] (a
   2-tuple of the form (length, value)).  The value field is structured
   as follows:


               +-----------------------------------------------+
               |           Identifier (Color Value)            |
               +-----------------------------------------------+
               |          Endpoint Address (Variable)          |
               +-----------------------------------------------+


   - Identifier: A 4-Octet identifier defined by the BGP speaker
   originating the NLRI, in order to uniquely identify the SR policy in
   the SR domain.  The value of the Identifier field SHOULD be the value
   used in the color extended community (as defined in [RFC5512])
   carried with payload prefixes the use of which is detailed in
   subsequent sections.

   - Endpoint Address: This field identifies the endpoint of the SR TE
   path being encoded.  It is one of the network addresses configured on
   the endpoint router of the SR TE path.  The length of the endpoint
   address is dependent on the AFI being advertised.  If the AFI is set
   to IPv4 (1), then the endpoint address is a 4-octet IPv4 address,
   whereas if the AFI is set to IPv6 (2), the endpoint address is a
   16-octet IPv6 address.

   An update message that carries the MP_REACH_NLRI or MP_UNREACH_NLRI
   attribute with the Encapsulation SAFI MUST also carry the BGP
   mandatory attributes: ORIGIN, AS_PATH, and LOCAL_PREF (for IBGP
   neighbors), as defined in [RFC4271].  In addition, such an update
   message can also contain any of the BGP optional attributes.  The
   SAFI NLRI also encodes the color value in order to influence an
   action on the receiving speaker.  Specifically the Color extended
   community SHOULD be propagated with BGP payload prefixes in order to
   associate with the NLRI of the SAFI prefixes with a given SR policy.

   The nexthop address is set based on the AFI in the attribute.  For
   example, if the AFI is set to IPv4 (1), the nexthop is encoded as a
   4-byte IPv4 address.  If the AFI is set to IPv6 (2), the nexthop is
   encoded as a 16-byte IPv6 address of the router.  It is important to
   note that any BGP speaker receiving a BGP message with an SR

   Encapsulation NLRI, will process it only if the NLRI has a best path
   as per the BGP best path selection algorithm.

3.  BGP SR Explicit Route Object (ERO) Attribute

3.1.  New Attribute Definition

   BGP SR ERO (Explicit Route Object) attribute is a new optional,
   transitive BGP path attribute.  The attribute type code for BGP SR
   ERO attribute is to be assigned by IANA (suggested value 50).

   The value field of the attribute is composed or one or more TLV
   objects.  The following sections describe the SR-ERO, Weight and
   Binding TLVs.

3.2.  ERO TLV Definition

   The SR-ERO TLV encodes one segment of the SR policy path (loose or
   strict) in the form of a SID and its related information.  Multiple
   occurrences of ERO TLV object can be encoded in a single attribute
   with the objects grouped into multiple sets for load-balancing
   purposes.

   Each set defines a distinct SID list to be used in equal-cost or
   unequal-cost load-balancing.  The SR-ERO TLV has the following format
   (encoding is based on ERO sub-object definition in
   [I-D.sivabalan-pce-segment-routing]):


        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |      Type                     |      Length                   |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |   ST Type     |         Flags                   |I|L|N|F|S|C|M|
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       //                          SID (32 bits or 128 bits)          //
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       //                        NAI (variable)                       //
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Each SR-ERO TLV object consists of a 64-bit header followed by the
   SID and the NAI associated with the SID.  The SID is a 32-bit value
   (as specified in [I-D.sivabalan-pce-segment-routing]).The SID can
   also be a 128 bit value when encoding a IPv6 SID as indicated with
   the 'I' flag bit set, if this bit is unset, SID defaults to a 32 bit

   value.  The size of the NAI depends on its respective type, as
   described in the following sections.

   "Type" contains the codepoint of the SR-ERO TLV object.  The SR-ERO
   TLV codepoint is to be assigned by IANA (suggested value 1).  In
   future other types maybe defined to encode characteristics (e.g
   bandwidth values) relevant to the segment list thus encoded.

   "Length" contains the total length of the object in octets, excluding
   "Type" and "Length" fields.  Length MUST be at least 4, and MUST be a
   multiple of 4.  The length value should take into consideration SID
   or NAI only if they are not null.  The flags described below used to
   indicate whether SID or NAI field is null.

   SID Type (ST) indicates the type of the information associated with
   the SID contained in the object body.  The SID-Type values are
   described later in this document

   SID is the Segment Identifier.

   NAI contains the Node or Adjacency Identifier associated with the
   SID.  Depending on the value of ST, the NAI can have different
   formats as described in the following section.

   Flags carry any additional information related to the SID.
   Currently, the following flag bits are defined:

   * M: When this bit is set, the SID value represents an MPLS label
   stack entry as specified in [RFC5462] where only the label value is
   specified by the BGP speaker.  Other label fields (i.e: TC, S, and
   TTL) fields MUST be ignored, and receiving BGP speaker MUST set these
   fields according to its local policy and MPLS forwarding rules.

   * C: When this bit as well as the M bit are set, then the SID value
   represents an MPLS label stack entry as specified in [RFC5462], where
   all the entry's fields (Label, TC, S, and TTL) are specified by the
   sending BGP speaker.  However, a receiving BGP speaker MAY choose to
   override TC, S, and TTL values according its local policy and MPLS
   forwarding rules.

   * S: When this bit is set, the SID value in the object body is null.
   In this case, the receiving BGP speaker is responsible for choosing
   the SID value, e.g., by looking up its Tunnel DB using the NAI which,
   in this case, MUST be present in the object.

   * F: When this bit is set, the NAI value in the object body is null.

Internet-Draft     Segment Routing TE Policy using BGP      October 2015


   * N: When this bit is set, it specifies the start of a new SID list.
   Multiple SID lists can be encoded in the ERO attribute signifying a
   equal-cost or unequal-cost set of multi-path SID lists to be used for
   load-balancing (leveraging the Weight TLV defined later in this
   document).

   * L:(Loose flag).  Indicates whether the encoding represents a loose-
   hop in the LSP [RFC3209].  If "L" is unset, a BGP speaker MUST NOT
   overwrite the SID value present in the SR-TLV object.  Otherwise, a
   BGP speaker, based on local policy, MAY expand or replace one or more
   SID value(s) in the received SR-ERO attribute.

   * I:(IPv6 SID flag).  Indicates whether the SID encoding represents a
   128 bit IPv6 address when set.  When unset, the SID defaults to a 32
   bit encoding

3.3.  NAI Associated with SID

   The NAI encoding is as per corresponding TLV definition in
   [I-D.sivabalan-pce-segment-routing]

3.4.  Weight TLV object type.

   The Weight TLV specifies the weight associated to the SID list in
   case of unequal cost multipath.

   The Weight TLV has the following format:


        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |      Type = 2                 |      Length                   |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                              Weight                           |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+



   "Type" is 2.  Length is 4 octets (excluding Type and Length)

   When present, the Weight TLV specifies a weight to be associated with
   the corresponding SID list, for use in unequal-cost multipath.
   Weights are applied by summing the total value of all of the weights
   for all SID lists, and then assigning a fraction of the forwarded
   traffic to each SID list in proportion its weight's fraction of the
   total."

Internet-Draft     Segment Routing TE Policy using BGP      October 2015


   The Weight TLV, if present, MUST be encoded prior to the encoding of
   the SR ERO TLV object with the "N" bit set, that is it MUST precede
   the encoding of a new SID list.  The weight, when present, is thus
   associated with set of SIDs following the weight TLV and there MUST
   be only one weight TLV encoded for each set of SIDs (SID list)
   encoded in the attribute.  Length is 4 indicating the number of
   octets used to encode the weight value.

3.5.  Binding SID TLV object type.

   The Binding TLV allows to request the allocation of a Binding Segment
   associated to the SID list carried in the SR-ERO TLVs.  The Binding
   TLV has the following format:


      0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |      Type = 3                 |      Length                   |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                        Value (optional)                       |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   "Type" is 3.  Value field is optional.  Length is 0 or 4 (when the
   "Value" field is present).  When the Length is 0, it implies the
   Value field is not present.

   When present, the TLV instructs the receiver of the message to
   allocate a Binding SID for the set of SID lists that are encoded.
   The value field when present, encodes a 32 bit SID value.  Also, when
   the value field is present, the TLV instructs the receiver of the
   message to use that value for the Binding SID allocated

   Further use of the Binding SID is described in a subsequent section.
   There MUST be only one binding SID TLV encoded in the attribute.

4.  Segment Routing Encapsulation SAFI operation

   SR Encap SAFI NLRIs are advertised with the ERO attribute.  The ERO
   attribute specifies one (or more for loadbalancing purposes) list of
   segment identifiers (SIDs), specifying the explicit SR TE path to the
   endpoint address encoded in the SR Encap SAFI NLRI.  Additionally,
   the SR Encap SAFI NLRI encodes a Color value in order to associate
   payload prefixes with a SR Policy path definition.  The BGP speaker
   SHOULD then attach a Color Extended Community (as defined in
   [RFC5512]) to payload prefixes (e.g., IPv4 unicast) in order to
   select the appropriate SR-TE path created by the SR Encap SAFI



Sreekantiah, et al.      Expires April 18, 2016                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft     Segment Routing TE Policy using BGP      October 2015


   update.  Hence, the Color value in the Encap SAFI NLRI allows to
   implement a classification mechanism.

   If a BGP speaker originates an update for prefix P with color C and
   with itself or a third party as the next hop, then it SHOULD also
   originate an SR Encap SAFI update containing a NLRI encoded with the
   prefix P's BGP nexthop (as the Endpoint address) and Color value
   matching the one of prefix P, and a list of SIDs defining the SR-TE
   Explicit path in the ERO attribute.

   The SR Encap SAFI update in this case MAY also be sent by a
   controller, in lieu of the originating speaker sending the SAFI
   update with with the endpoint address set to the originating speaker
   in the SAFI NLRI.  Also the controller can possibly color payload
   prefixes or originate payload prefixes with a color value in place of
   the originating BGP speaker.

   On reception of a SR Encap SAFI update, a BGP speaker SHOULD initiate
   the creation of a SR TE explicit path with the Endpoint address in
   the NLRI as the destination endpoint and the explicit path specified
   by the lists of SIDs in the ERO TLVs in the attribute.

   On the receiving BGP speaker, all payload prefixes that share the
   same color (as determined by the color extended community on the best
   path) and the same nexthop are mapped to the same SR-TE explicit path
   created upon the receipt of the SR Encap SAFI update with the
   matching color and endpoint addresses in the NLRI.

   Similarly, different payload prefixes can be mapped to distinct SR-TE
   Explicit paths by coloring them differently.

5.  Multipath Operation

   The ERO attribute in the SR Encap SAFI update MAY contain multiple
   list of SIDs (instead of a single one) which, in the absence of the
   Weight TLV, signifies equal cost load-balancing amongst them.

   When a weight TLV is encoded for each list, then the weight values
   SHOULD be used in order to perform a unequal cost load balance
   amongst the list of SIDs specified.  Thus in the general case the ERO
   attribute in the SR Encap SAFI NLRI can identify a set of SR TE
   Explicit paths for load balancing operation.

6.  Binding SID TLV

   When the optional Binding SID TLV is present in the ERO attribute of
   a SR Encap SAFI update, it indicates an instruction, to the receiving

   BGP speaker to allocate a Binding SID for the list of SIDs the
   Binding TLV is related to.

   Any incoming packet with the Binding SID will then be swapped for the
   list of SIDs specified in the ERO attribute on the allocating BGP
   speaker.  The allocated binding SID MAY be then advertised by the BGP
   speaker that created it, through, e.g., BGP-LS so to, typically, feed
   a BGP controller with updated topology information.

7.  Reception of a BGP ERO Attribute

   When a BGP speaker receives a SR Encap SAFI NLRI from a neighbor with
   an acceptable BGP SR ERO attribute, it SHOULD compute the segment
   list and equivalent MPLS label stack from the attribute TLVs and
   program them in the MPLS data plane.

   Also, It SHOULD program its MPLS dataplane so that BGP payload
   prefixes sharing the same Color Extended Community of the SR Encap
   SAFI NLRI are steered into the SR-Encap policy (defined by the SR
   Encap SAFI NLRI) instead of using the original BGP payload prefix
   nexthop label.

   In the future, new flags in the ERO attribute TLV MAY be defined in
   order to support other label operations (such as replacing inner
   labels associated with the BGP prefix)

   When building the MPLS label stack from a ERO attribute, the
   receiving BGP speaker MUST interpret the list of SR-ERO TLVs as
   follows.

   The first TLV of a SR ERO attribute represents the topmost label.  In
   the receiving BGP speaker, it identifies the first segment the
   traffic will be directed towards to (along the SR-TE path).

   The last TLV of a SR ERO attribute represents the bottommost label.

8.  Announcing BGP Segment Routing ERO Attribute

   Typically, the value of the SIDs encoded in the ERO attribute TLV is
   determined by configuration.

   A BGP speaker SHOULD follow normal iBGP/eBGP rules to propagate the
   ERO attribute

   Since the BGP SR ERO attribute SID value must be unique within an SR
   domain, by default an implementation SHOULD NOT advertise the BGP SR
   ERO attribute outside an SR domain unless it is explicitly configured
   to do so.  To contain distribution of the BGP SR ERO attribute beyond

   its intended scope of applicability, attribute filtering MAY be
   deployed.

9.  Flowspec and BGP SR ERO Attribute

   The BGP SR ERO attribute can be carried in context of a Flowspec NLRI
   (RFC 5575).  In this case, when the redirect to IP nexthop is
   specified as in draft-ietf-idr-flowspec-redirect-ip-02, the tunnel to
   the nexthop is specified by the segment list in the ERO attribute,.
   The Segment List (i.e.: label stack) is imposed to flows matching the
   criteria in the Flowspec route in order to steer them towards the
   nexthop as specified by the ERO attribute.

13.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new BGP attribute known as BGP SR ERO
   attribute.  This document requests IANA to assign a new attribute
   code type for BGP SR ERO attribute from the BGP Path Attributes
   registry.

14.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security risks introduced by this design.
