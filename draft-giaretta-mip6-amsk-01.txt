Abstract 
    
   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) defines an extensible 
   framework for performing network access authentication. Most EAP 
   authentication algorithms, also known as "methods", export keying 
   material that can be used with lower layer ciphersuites. It has been 
   proposed [11] to leverage the EAP keying framework to derive 
   Application Master Session Keys (AMSKs) for specific applications or 
   services.

1. Introduction 
    
   Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) requires that Mobile Nodes (MNs) and Home Agents 
   (HAs) share a security association to protect binding management 
   signaling. The MIPv6 protocol specification [1] mandates the use of 
   IPsec for this purpose and therefore requires the MN to be 
   provisioned with the data needed to bootstrap an IPsec Security 
   Association (SA) with its Home Agent. This is one of the main issues 
   of the so called Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping problem [10]. The IPsec SA 
   between MN and HA can be established from a shared secret using IKE 
   with Pre-Shared Key (PSK) authentication [6]. Alternatively, the 
   Authentication Protocol for MIPv6 [5] presents a different security 
   mechanism for Mobile IPv6 that requires a shared secret between MN 
   and HA to authenticate the binding messages. In scenarios where 
   network access control is based on EAP those shared secrets can be 
   derived from the EAP key hierarchy [12]. 
    
   This document defines how to generate Application Master Session Keys 
   (AMSKs) specific for Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping, both for IPsec SAs 
   and Authentication Protocol SAs. The solution presented in this 
   document is agnostic of the AAA-HA interface model (e.g. push/pull 
   model).

2. Terminology 
 
   Most of the terms used in this document are defined in this section; 
   more detailed general mobility and EAP terminology can be found in 
   [7] and [12].  
    
   MSA 
    
         Mobility Service Authorizer. A service provider that authorizes 
         Mobile IPv6 service. 
    
   ASA 
    
         Access Service Authorizer. A network operator that 
         authenticates a mobile host and establishes the mobile host's 
         authorization to receive Internet service. 
    
   Split scenario 
    
         A scenario where the mobility service and the network access 
         service are authorized by different entities (MSA!=ASA). 
          
   Integrated scenario 
    
         A scenario where the mobility service and the network access 
         service are authorized by the same entity (MSA=ASA). 
    
   EAP server 
    
         The entity that terminates the EAP authentication method with 
         the peer.  In the case where no backend authentication server 
         is used, the EAP server is part of the authenticator.  In the 
         case where the authenticator operates in pass-through mode, the 
         EAP server is located on the backend authentication server. 
          
   MSK   Master Session key 
          
         Keying material that is derived between the EAP peer and server 
         and exported by the EAP method. The MSK is at least 64 octets 
         in length. 
          
   EMSK  Extended Master Session Key 
    
         Additional keying material derived between the peer and server 
         that is exported by the EAP method. The EMSK is at least 64 
         octets in length, and is never shared with a third party.

   AMSK  Application Master Session Key 
    
         Keys derived from the EMSK which are cryptographically separate 
         from each other.  
    
   MN    Mobile Node  
    
         A node that can change its point of attachment from one link to 
         another, while still being reachable via its home address. 
    
   HA    Home Agent  
    
         A router on a mobile node's home link with which the mobile 
         node has registered its current care-of address.  While the 
         mobile node is away from home, the home agent intercepts 
         packets on the home link addressed to the mobile node's home 
         address, encapsulates them, and tunnels them to the mobile 
         node's registered care-of address. 
    
   BU    Binding Update  
    
         A message indicating a mobile node's current mobility binding, 
         and in particular its care-of address. 
    
   BA    Binding Acknowledgement  
    
         A message used to acknowledge receipt of a Binding Update.

3. Applicability Statement 
    
   The Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping problem statement [10] describes two 
   main scenarios.  In the first scenario (i.e. the split scenario), the 
   mobility service is authorized by a different service authorizer 
   (MSA, Mobility Service Authorizer) than the basic network access 
   authorizer (ASA, Access Service Authorizer). In the second scenario 
   (i.e. the integrated scenario), the mobile node's mobility service is 
   authorized by the same service authorizer as the basic network access 
   service authorizer.  This implies that only in the integrated 
   scenario it is possible to leverage the network access authentication 
   to bootstrap mobility service. Therefore, the approach defined in 
   this document applies only to the integrated scenario. 
    
   This specification assumes that AAA server and the EAP server are co-
   located, with the latter exporting the keys to the former. As already 
   pointed out, the solution presented here addresses both the IPsec and 
   rfc4285-based SAs bootstrapping. 
    
3.1 Bootstrapping IPsec SAs with Pre-shared keys 
    
   The bootstrapping solution defined for integrated scenario [18] 
   requires the mobile node to run an EAP exchange over IKEv2. In case 
   the mobile node uses EAP for network access authentication, this 
   implies that the MN executes two EAP exchanges, possibly with the 
   same EAP server and using the same credentials. 
    
   Therefore, in this scenario an AMSK, named IKEv2-AMSK, can be used as 
   the IKEv2 Pre-shared Key (PSK), with the advantage that only one EAP 
   exchange is performed (during network access authentication).  
    
   The key is derived by the MN and the AAAH server and needs to be 
   transferred to the HA (together with the MN/key identifier).  Two 
   different approaches are possible:  
    
      1. The AAAH server sends proactively the key to the HA (push 
         approach). A requirement for this approach is that the AAAH 
         server needs to know the HA assigned to the MN. 
       
      2. The HA requests to the AAAH the PSK during the IKEv2 exchange 
         with the MN (pull approach). In this case the HA needs to know 
         the AAAH server used by a specific MN for network access 
         authentication. 
 
   Figure 1 and 2 (pag. 8) show the message flow of the two models. Note 
   that in both approaches the MN/key identifier must be sent via the 
   AAA-HA interface and needs to be the same identifier used in IKEv2.

3.2 Bootstrapping rfc4285-based SAs 
    
   Concerning rfc4285-based SAs, the keying material derived from EAP 
   can be exploited in two different ways, since two possible 
   authentication options are specified: 
    
    
      1. MN-HA Mobility Message Authentication Option. In this case, an
         AMSK, named MN-HA-AMSK, is used as the shared key for the 
         security association between the MN and HA. Similarly to the 
         IKEv2 Pre-shared key case, both the push and pull model can be 
         envisioned for key delivery. The MN/key identifier must be sent 
         via the AAA-HA interface and needs to be the same identifier to 
         be used as Mobile Node Identifier (in the form of NAI) in the 
         BUs. 
       
      2. MN-AAA Mobility Message Authentication Option. In this case, an
         AMSK, named MN-AAA-AMSK, is used as the shared-key for the 
         security association between the MN and the AAAH server. In 
         this case, no key delivery is needed.

4. AMSK derivation 
    
   The key hierarchy proposed in this document is depicted in Figure 3. 
   Three different AMSKs are defined: MN-AAA AMSK, MN-HA AMSK and IKEv2-
   AMSK. The basic assumption is that the EMSK is exported by the EAP 
   server to the AAA server; these keys are then derived directly from 
   the EMSK by the AAA server of the MSA. 
    
                                  EMSK 
                                   | 
                +----------------------------------+

            MN-AAA AMSK       MN-HA AMSK       IKEv2-AMSK  
    
                         Figure 3 - Proposed key hierarchy 
    
    
   Mobile IPv6 AMSKs are derived through the general key derivation 
   function (KDF) specified in [12]. The KDF is shown below for the sake 
   of clarity. 
    
   KDF (K,L,D,O) = T1 | T2 | T3 | T4 | ... 
    
         where: 
         T1 = prf (K, S | 0x01) 
         T2 = prf (K, T1 | S | 0x02) 
         T3 = prf (K, T2 | S | 0x03) 
         T4 = prf (K, T3 | S | 0x04) 
    
         prf = HMAC-SHA1 
         K = EMSK 
         L = key label 
         D = application data 
         O = output length 
         S = L | " " | D | O 
    
   The application specific parameters are set as follows: 
    
   IKEv2 Pre-shared key AMSK (IKEv2-AMSK): 
         key label = "MIPv6-IKEv2-key" 
         application data = "HA Address" 
         output length = variable (default 128)

   The actual key(s) to be derived by MN and AAA server depend on the 
   authentication method deployed by the operator (or imposed by 
   specific technologies). It should be possible on the operator side to 
   differentiate users' authentication method on profile basis.  
    
   The KDF does not include the home address in the application data 
   because in this way the MN can derive the AMSK even if it does not 
   know its home address yet. This is what might happen in some dynamic 
   home address assignment scenarios. 
    
   As specified in [12], the lifetime of keys calculated from key 
   material exported by EAP methods can not be longer than the lifetime 
   of the exported keying material. As a default choice the lifetime of 
   AMSK for MIPv6 is set equal to the lifetime of the EMSK. 
 
   Since the IKEv2-AMSK serves only for identity verification and not 
   for authentication or ciphering purposes, there might be no need to 
   re-generate the key at regular intervals. However, the IKEv2-AMSK 
   must be refreshed whenever a new EMSK is generated (i.e. during re-
   authentication events). Since the MN-HA key is used to authenticate 
   BUs and BAs messages, there is a clear need to keep these keys fresh 
   and therefore to derive new keys periodically. This is discussed in 
   section 5.4.

5. Open issues 
    
   AMSKs are still a work in progress in IETF and a good amount of study 
   is underway to standardize their generation and usage. For this 
   reason, this document leaves open some issues as input for HOAKY BoF 
   and others related WGs. 
    
5.1 Key hierarchy 
    
   As depicted in Figure 3, the key hierarchy proposed in this document 
   implies that three different AMSKs are directly derived from the 
   EMSK. Another approach could be to define just one AMSK for MIPv6 
   that is used as root key for deriving other more specific keys (e.g. 
   MN-AAA-key or IKEv2-key). This may have the advantage that the EMSK 
   can be deleted just after the derivation of the AMSK for MIPv6. 
   Figure 4 depicts the resulting key hierarchy.

                         Figure 4 - Alternative key hierarchy 
    
    
5.2 Key length (and other key related parameters) 
    
   This specification doesn't address the problem of negotiating the key 
   length; this is a general issue for AMSKs and should be solved in a 
   generic way, not depending on the application that makes use of the 
   keys (e.g. Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping).  
    
   One very basic approach, applicable to some scenarios, is that the 
   operator pre-provisions the user equipment with the right parameters 
   (e.g. the right key lenght for a specific application). 
    
   If an explicit negotiation is needed, a possible approach could be 
   the one adopted in [17] that leverages the capability of some EAP 
   methods (e.g. EAP-SIM, EAP-FAST, etc.) to carry arbitrary parameters 
   during the authentication phase. 
      
   However, it is worthwhile noting that some applications require only 
   fixed length keys (e.g. MN-HA-AMSK and MN-AAA-AMSK for the MIPv6 
   Authentication Protocol) and for those applications this is not an 
   issue.

5.3 rfc4285 SAs 
    
   This document addresses only the negotiation of the shared secret 
   among MN and HA (or AAA). Other parameters such as SPIs must be 
   negotiated through other mechanisms. As for the key length issue this 
   could be addressed by an explicit negotiation [17]. Another approach 
   might be the derivation of the SPI from the EAP keying hierarchy 
   itself. 
    
5.4 Key Freshness 
  
   While not an issue for IKEv2 PSK authentication, for rfc2485-based 
   authentications the keys used to authenticate binding management 
   messages should be fresh and therefore periodically changed. This 
   document addresses only bootstrapping mechanisms and so the renewal 
   of keying material is out of scope. A suggested solution may be that 
   the MN-HA-AMSK is not used directly but a new derived key is 
   generated from it at each BU/BA completed exchange (e.g. exchanging 
   nonces in BUs and BAs).  
    
5.5 Multiple EAP sessions 
    
   In some scenarios (e.g. multi-homed terminals) a MN may have more 
   than one active EAP session at the same time. Therefore, there is the 
   need to define criteria for deciding which session(s) are in charge 
   of generating AMSKs, and for which applications. 
    
5.6 Identity management and key binding 
    
   A MN can be associated to several identities at the same time (e.g. 
   pseudonyms for identity privacy or temporary identities for EAP fast 
   reconnect techniques like [9]). The AAAH server must be aware of the 
   identity used by the MN in IKEv2 or rfc-4285 signaling. In pull model 
   this is needed to allow the AAAH server to select the correct key to 
   be delivered, upon requests, to the HA. In push model this is needed 
   to allow the AAAH server to proactively deliver to the HA the correct 
   MN identity information so that the HA can bind the subsequent 
   authentication requests to the right key.

6. AAA-HA interface requirements 
 
   In order to fulfil the bootstrapping of MIPv6-related SAs, this 
   document adds/modifies some requirements for the HA-AAA interface 
   [20]: 
    
    -  G1.4 should use MUST (instead of SHOULD): "The AAA-HA interface
       MUST provide confidentiality since it may be used to transfer 
       keying material (e.g. shared key generated during EAP 
       authentication)"  
    
    -  HAs must be able to fetch keys from AAA servers (pull approach)
 
    -  the AAAH server must be able to push a key into the HA (push
       approach) 
 
    -  key identifiers and lifetimes must be transferred alongside the
       key 
 
    -  in the request sent to the AAAH server in pull mode, HA must
       specify the HA address known be the MN, so that the AAAH server 
       can derive the right key.

7. Security Considerations 
    
   Sending AMSKs for Mobile IPv6 from the AAA server to the HA requires 
   that the protocol used for AAA-HA communication provides mutual 
   authentication, integrity/reply protection and confidentiality. 
    
   Moreover, since this document is strongly based on EAP [8] and the 
   EAP Keying Management Framework [12], additional security 
   considerations are bound to those valid for the EAP Keying Framework.
