Internet-Draft        NSIS Signaling in Multihoming            July 2005


1.  Introduction

   Multihoming refers to a situation where an end node has several
   parallel communication paths to use.  An end node (e.g., mobile node
   (MN) in mobile environments) may integrate several wireless access
   technologies (thus, multiple interfaces).  One of the main purposes
   of having multiple interfaces is to utilize all means of
   communications to access the Internet ubiquitously.  In such
   multihomed environments, flows may be redirected from one interface
   to the other due to the sudden lack of connectivity or change of the
   network conditions.

   Multiple interfaces can also be used in order to increase bandwidth
   availability or to select the most appropriate interface according to
   the type of flow or choices of the user [8].  Basically, each network
   interface has different performance, bandwidth, access range, and
   reliability.  Users may want to select the most appropriate set of
   network interface(s) depending on the network environment,
   particularly in wireless networks which are less reliable than wired
   networks.  Users may also want to select the most appropriate
   interface based on certain criteria or to combine a set of interfaces
   to get sufficient bandwidth [8].  Other benefits of multihoming
   include load balancing, bi-casting, preference, load sharing, and
   etc.

   In multihomed environments, multiple addresses can be allocated to
   either a single interface or multiple interfaces to provide
   ubiquitous, permanent and fault-tolerant access to the Internet,
   particularly on mobile nodes which are prone to failure or loss of
   connectivity.

   NSIS signaling should be able to support various multihoming
   scenarios as described in [3],[5].  This draft describes NSIS
   operations and applicability in multihomed environments.  The
   remainder of this draft is organized as follows.  Section 2 defines
   the terms used in the draft, and Section 3 illustrates the problems
   regarding multihoming in mobile environments from the NSIS point of
   view.  Section 4 analyzes NSIS operations in multihomed environments,
   and Section 5 describes a few NSIS applicability scenarios in the
   multihomed networks.

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].

Internet-Draft        NSIS Signaling in Multihoming            July 2005


   This draft is based on the terminology defined in [2], [3], [4], [5].
   In addition, the following terms are used.

   (1) Interface

      A node's point of attachment to a link

   (2) Multihomed Node

      A node (either a host or a router) is multihomed when it has
      multiple homogeneous/heterogeneous interfaces.

   (3) Multihomed Network

      A network is multihomed when either the network is simultaneously
      connected to the Internet via more than one router, or when a
      router is multi-interfaced.



3.  Problem Statement

   This section describes possible issues on NSIS signaling in the
   multihomed environments.

   The general problems caused by mobility are as follows.

   o  Notification of alternative path

      A mechanism is needed to inform the other end (HA or CN) of the
      communication about the alternative path that is to be used for a
      certain purpose, e.g., load balancing or bandwidth increase.
      Alternative paths may be represented by alternative CoAs in
      mobility scenarios.  The mechanism should provide a way to convey
      such alternative CoAs.

   o  Path Failure Detection

      When an active path (for NSIS signaling and data flows) failure
      occurs, the MN should be able to detect outages in the path that
      is currently being used.

   o  Registration of Multiple CoAs

      With MIPv6, an MN may have several CoAs, but only one, termed the
      primary CoA, can be registered with its home agent (HA) and the
      correspondent nodes (CNs).  However, for purposes of bandwidth,
      delay, or others, it is useful for the MN to get Internet access



Lee, et al.             Expires January 12, 2006                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft        NSIS Signaling in Multihoming            July 2005


      through multiple access media simultaneously, in which case
      multiple active CoAs would be assigned to the MN.

   o  Interworking between resource reservation and binding update

      When the MN has multiple CoAs, those CoAs may be sent to the HA
      together with the binding update request message for immediate QoS
      re-establishment.  When to send the CoAs during the binding update
      procedure should be optimized for reducing state setup delay.

   o  Media detection

      IPv6 has no clearly defined mechanism for detecting the
      availability or loss of media except through the ability or
      inability to receive router advertisements within a stipulated
      period.  An efficient way to detect media loss should be provided
      so that the redirection between interfaces can be performed
      quickly to support seamless services.  Media detection can be used
      to trigger necessary NSIS operations.

   o  Heterogeneous wireless interfaces

      Several heterogeneous wireless interfaces can be integrated to
      increase bandwidth availability or to select the most appropriate
      technology (or interface) according to the type of flow or choices
      of the user.  It should be possible to select the most appropriate
      interface based on certain criteria or to combine a set of
      interfaces to get sufficient bandwidth.

   o  Selection of the Optimal CoAs for QoS

      AIn a scenario where an MN has multiple registered CoAs, it might
      be necessary to select the optimal CoAs associated with the
      optimal paths for QoS purposes (e.g., bandwidth, delay, etc.).  In
      this case, HAs should be able to decide the optimal CoAs before
      the binding update is completed.  The choice of CoAs should be
      based on certain criteria.

   o  Route Optimization in multihomed environments

      In the situation where route optimization is used to avoid the
      triangular routing and tunneling-related problems, the CN should
      be able to perform the registration of multiple CoAs, selection of
      the best CoA to determine the route optimization path.

   o  Anticipated handover support

      An MN may have access to multiple interfaces in heterogeneous



Lee, et al.             Expires January 12, 2006                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft        NSIS Signaling in Multihoming            July 2005


      networks, and it can be connected to the old access router through
      the existing interfaces during handover to support seamless
      services.  Therefore, multihoming can be used in the situation
      where the anticipated handover is needed.  This approach is more
      plausible in heterogeneous network rather than in homogeneous
      networks.



4.  NSIS operations in multihomed networks

   In multihomed environment, multiple interfaces and addresses (i.e.,
   CoAs and HoAs) are available and thus how to select or acquire most
   appropriate interface and/or address is of great concern [9].  One of
   the NSIS's goals is to achieve end-to-end signaling for various
   signaling applications.  However, some reasons such as existence of
   NAT/FW, scarce wireless resources, usage of tunneling, and frequent
   change of end host's address make it difficult for NSIS signaling to
   achieve end-to-end signaling.  In this case, the interaction with the
   multihoming schemes and NSIS signaling protocols could alleviate
   issues caused by wireless bottleneck and mobility events.  In this
   section, we discuss some NSIS signaling issues on interworking with
   multihomed networks and also present on how NSIS signaling should
   perform multihomed signaling in mobility scenarios.

4.1  Considerations on multihomed mobile networks

   In order to achieve the multihomed QoS signaling, the MN would need
   to register several CoAs with unique HoA.  However, since the present
   specification of MIPv6 only allows the MN to register a single CoA
   per HoA, a solution like [6] needs to be used for multiple CoAs
   registration.  On the other hand when the MN has more than one HoA
   given either by one HA or multiple HAs, multiple CoAs registration
   may not happen because each CoA could be bound with single HoA.
   Throughout the scenario in this draft, we assumed that an appropriate
   multiple CoAs registration mechanism is provided.

   When a route optimization is used a direct connection is established
   between an MN and a CN, in which case another reservation needs to be
   made while releasing the existing reservation engaged in the HA.  In
   order to avoid this situation, the NSIS signaling for resource
   reservation needs to be performed only after finishing the route
   optimization, which is the way assumed in the following scenarios.
   On the other hand, without route optimization the resource
   reservation could be performed immediately after establishing reverse
   tunnel.

   In this section we are detailing the two scenarios for multihomed QoS

   signaling: receiver-initiated reservation and sender-initiated
   reservation.  Figure 1 depicts the multihomed environment where an MN
   with multiple interfaces moves to new area in which several ARs could
   possibly serve the MN.  After handover, the MN checks the strength of
   the beacon signal and the available link bandwidth that neighboring
   ARs provide, and chooses the most stable several ARs.  An MN acquires
   multiple CoAs from the chosen ARs each of which is advertising single
   prefix, and then each CoA is assigned to one of the interfaces of the
   MN.

   Figure 1. Illustration of the Multihomed environment


   We assumed homogeneous wireless interfaces in this draft though
   multihoming with multiple interfaces would be more efficient on
   heterogeneous interfaces due to the increased path diversity.  The
   issues on heterogeneous interfaces are for further study.

   Seamoby protocols such as CARD [10] and CTP [11] are not considered
   in this draft because anticipated handover mechanism is not used.  As
   a first step, this draft discusses interaction with basic
   macromobility management protocols (e.g., Mobile IPv4/6).  The
   interaction with mircomobility are for further study for performance
   optimization.

   Figure 2. Receiver-initiated reservation in the multihomed
   environment

   After handover, an MN acquires multiple CoAs through aforementioned
   procedure and immediately sends a Binding Update to the CN for each
   of newly acquired CoAs.  The CN acknowledges the binding update (BU)
   by sending a binding acknowledgment (BA) to the MN.

   On receiving each BA, the MN immediately sends a QUERY message toward
   the CN through the interface associated with the CoA, to probe the
   network for information about the data path (the procedure (1)-(3) in
   Figure 2).  The available resource on the path is recorded in the
   `QoS Available' object of QSPEC contained in the QUERY message.

4.2.2  Intermediate node operation

   The intermediate node inspects the 'QoS Available' object of the
   received QUERY message, and if its available resource is less than
   what 'QoS Available' says currently, the node adapts it accordingly.
   Therefore, when the QUERY message reaches the CN `QoS available'
   reflects the bottleneck of the resource currently available on the
   path.

   It is note worthy that the intermediate nodes between the CRN and the



Lee, et al.             Expires January 12, 2006                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft        NSIS Signaling in Multihoming            July 2005


   CN would not take the bandwidth reserved by the same session of the
   old path into account when measuring the available bandwidth, so that
   the new path having large overlapped portion with the old one might
   be at disadvantage during the Primary CoA selection.

4.2.3  Primary CoA selection

   On receiving the QUERY messages the CN performs the Primary CoA
   determination procedure for the MN (4).  The QUERY messages received
   no later than a certain time period after the reception of the first
   QUERY message are taken into account for the procedure.  The time
   period is used to prevent the QUERY messages that arrive too late or
   have been dropped on the way from delaying the decision procedure.
   Though the small waiting time might exclude several messages from the
   procedure it would be desirable to maintain the time period to be
   small because the QUERY messages along the path with good condition
   would have been arrived earlier than others.  On the other hand, the
   procedure could be immediately started even before the time period
   elapses when all Query messages are received, which is possible
   because the CN is aware of the total number of QUERY messages to
   receive beforehand through the number of BU messages.

   The CN determines the Primary CoA based first on the available
   bandwidth and second on the arrival time of Query messages.  When the
   available resource pertained in a QUERY message is conforming to the
   MN's BW requirement, the CoA delivered in the QUERY message is
   selected as the Primary CoA.  In the case of more than one conforming
   QUERY messages, the message arrived first is selected.

4.2.4  Reservation re-establishment and teardown

   The CN sends a RESERVE message toward the MN to reserve resource
   along the path the Primary CoA takes.  In this case, the RESERVE
   message activates two different actions: flow ID update and resource
   reservation.  A flow ID consisting of source and destination
   addresses is used to identify the data communication route.  On
   receiving RESERVE message, the nodes between the CN and the CRN
   updates the existing flow ID by replacing the old CoA with the new
   one, and uses the existing reservations for new path (5).  On the
   other hand, resource reservations are performed between the CRN and
   new AR to establish new path (6).  If the reservation is not
   successful the CN transmits another RESERVE message using the CoA
   with the next highest priority.

   The CRN initiates a Teardown message toward old access router (OAR)
   to release the reserved resource (8).

4.3  Sender-initiated reservation in the multihomed environment



Lee, et al.             Expires January 12, 2006                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft        NSIS Signaling in Multihoming            July 2005


   Sender-initiated reservation shares the procedure of receiver-
   initiated approach except for the reversed entity for the generation
   of Query and RESERVE messages.  In sender-initiated reservation, the
   QUERY and RESERVE messages are initiated by a CN and an MN
   respectively, where the MN selects the Primary CoA based on the
   information delivered by the QUERY message.  The CN can send QUERY
   message immediately after transmitting BA because the received BU
   message indicates MN's new CoA.  As in the receiver-initiated
   reservation, the teardown message is initiated by the CRN to release
   the reservation in the obsolete path.  It is note worthy that unlike
   the sender-initiated reservation in NSIS the CN needs to send a QUERY
   message toward the MN.



5.  NSIS Applicability in multihomed scenarios

   As mentioned above, the multihomed networks enable NSIS signaling to
   be performed with several benefits in dynamic scenarios such as link
   failure, load balancing, load sharing, etc.  Especially, support for
   multihoming in mobility scenarios makes it possible for NSIS
   signaling to overcome wireless link bottleneck caused by scarce
   bandwidth.  This section describes possible applicability scenarios
   in case of NSIS signaling operation in the multihomed networks.

5.1  Link/node failure

   In case of some link or node failures due to congestion in the
   networks or re-booting of system, NSIS state on the involved path
   will be removed by responding to such error events.  In this case,
   NSIS state immediately needs to be recovered to provide seamless
   service for the applications.  If on-going session, for instance, is
   disconnected due to a wireless link failure in multihomed networks,
   an MN needs to look for alternative paths through other available
   interfaces to re-establish the session.  As described in Section 4,
   if an MN can have access to three stable wireless links with wholly
   or partially different routes and one of the wireless links fails,
   the MN again selects one interface (or multiple interfaces) with
   paths which are able to guarantee MN's specific requirements and re-
   establishes NSIS states along the new paths.  The path selection and
   NSIS signaling procedure are same except for the absence of teardown
   message for the obsolete path.  The detailed procedure of NSIS
   signaling flow on link/node failure is shown in Fig. 3.

   Figure 3. NSIS signaling flow procedure on load sharing



5.2  Load balancing

   When an MN moves to a new network attachment point in multihomed
   networks, it can acquire multiple CoAs through multiple different
   interfaces.  However, any route connected to the interfaces may not
   fully guarantee the MN's bandwidth requirement.  In this case, the MN
   needs to share its traffic load to all the routes connected to all
   accessible interfaces although the traffic load is only from one
   application.  It is called load balancing.  To support the data
   flows, the MN should initiate and forward QUERY messages to all the
   accessible interfaces to establish NSIS state on all the routes
   connected to the interfaces: it can be considered as a kind of load
   balancing for signaling.  Note that the path selection is performed
   by choosing multiple paths, not only one optimized path.

   As described in Section 4, for example, the MN wants to setup QoS-
   NSLP [2] state path being able to support the bandwidth requirement
   of 10Mbps after it undergoes handover in multihomed networks.
   However, any accessible path does not guarantee MN's requirements:
   each path can only support maximum 5Mbps for the MN's flows,
   respectively.  In this case, QoS-NSLP should create partial QoS spec.
   (e.g., QSPEC) based on the available resources of each path, and the
   same NSIS state may be managed with three different flow identifiers
   for a unique session identifier if the NSIS states are aggregated in
   somewhere of networks.  The procedure of NSIS signaling flow on this

   Figure 4. NSIS signaling flow procedure on load balancing


   This approach introduces some new traffic treatment mechanisms.  At
   first, senders should allocate multiple CoAs to data packets for the
   same application and distribute traffic flows to each interface
   according to partial QoS spec. allocated to each path.  Next,
   intermittent nodes or routers can support aggregated signaling if
   any.  That is, the nodes or routers would aggregate data flows with
   different flow identifiers for the same session identifier if the
   flows are merged.  Finally, receivers would assemble and re-order
   data packets with different CoAs, or HoAs for the same session.  The
   detailed analysis on those mechanisms is for further study.

5.3  Load Sharing

   While an MN sends real-time data packets through one interface (or
   multiple interfaces) after path selection caused by mobility, it may
   also want to simultaneously run some other applications.  However,

   the current path may not support MN's additional requirements any
   more due to scarce link or node resources.  In this case, the
   additional traffic loads generated by other applications need to be
   forwarded to networks through other accessible interfaces in the
   multihomed networks: it is called load sharing.  As discussed in
   Section 4, optimized paths are chosen by the method of signaling path
   selection.  NSIS state needs to be newly established on new paths
   through other accessible interfaces in an end-to-end manner while
   maintaining the existing NSIS state for the current application at
   the same time.  If the additional traffic loads are forwarded to the
   same CN, the existing and the new NSIS states may be aggregated
   depending on the number of HoAs mapped to multiple CoAs.  In this
   case, BOUND_SESSION_ID is required to aggregate data packets with
   different session identifiers contrary to the approach in Section 5.2
   [2].  The procedure of NSIS signaling flow on this approach is the
   same as in Fig. 3 shown in Section 5.1.
