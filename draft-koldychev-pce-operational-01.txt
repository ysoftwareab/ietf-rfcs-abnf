Abstract

   This document is meant to provide better clarity about how PCEP
   operates and hence to facilitate better interoperability between
   different equipment vendors.  The content of this document has been
   compiled based on the feedback from several multi-vendor interop
   exercises.  Several constructs are introduced to facilitate this,
   such as the LSP-DB and the ASSO-DB.

1.  Introduction

   Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP)
   [RFC5440] enables the communication between a Path Computation Client
   (PCC) and a Path Control Element (PCE), or between two PCEs based on
   the PCE architecture [RFC4655].

   PCEP Extensions for the Stateful PCE Model [RFC8231] describes a set
   of extensions to PCEP to enable active control of Multiprotocol Label
   Switching Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)

   tunnels.  [RFC8281] describes the setup and teardown of PCE-initiated
   LSPs under the active stateful PCE model, without the need for local
   configuration on the PCC, thus allowing for dynamic centralized
   control of a network.

   PCEP Extensions for Establishing Relationships Between Sets of LSPs
   [RFC8697] introduces a generic mechanism to create a grouping of LSPs
   which can then be used to define associations between a set of LSPs
   and a set of attributes (such as configuration parameters or
   behaviors) and is equally applicable to stateful PCE (active and
   passive modes) and stateless PCE.

   The PCEP protocol has evolved from a simple stateless model into a
   stateful model with more features being added.  Due to subtle
   differences in interpretation of existing PCEP standards, it was
   found that networking equipment vendors often had to adjust their
   implementations, in order to interoperate.  This informational
   document is meant to clarify these subtle differences and agree on a
   final model that all major vendors have agreed on and that all other
   vendors can adopt.  This document applies to RSVP-TE and Segment-
   Routing.

2.  Terminology

   The following terminologies are used in this document:

   PCC:  Path Computation Client.  Any client application requesting a
      path computation to be performed by a Path Computation Element.

   PCE:  Path Computation Element.  An entity (component, application,
      or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or
      route based on a network graph and applying computational
      constraints.

   PCEP:  Path Computation Element Protocol.

   MBB:  Make-Before-Break.  A procedure during which the head-end of a
      traffic-engineered path wishes to move traffic to a new path
      without losing any traffic, by first "making" a new path and then
      "breaking" the old path.

   Association parameters:  As described in [RFC8697], the combination
      of the mandatory fields Association type, Association ID and
      Association Source in the ASSOCIATION object uniquely identify the
      association group.  If the optional TLVs - Global Association
      Source or Extended Association ID are included, then they MUST be
      included in combination with mandatory fields to uniquely identify
      the association group.

Internet-Draft             PCEP CLARIFICATION              February 2020


   Association information:  As described in [RFC8697], the ASSOCIATION
      object could also include other optional TLVs based on the
      association types, that provides 'information' related to the
      association type.

   ERO:  Explicit Route Object is the path of the LSP encoded into a
      PCEP object.  To represent an empty ERO object, i.e., without any
      subobjects, we use the notation "ERO={}".  To represent an ERO
      object containing some given sequence of subobjects, we use the
      notation "ERO={A}".

3.  PCEP LSP Database

   We introduce the concept of the LSP-DB, as a database of actual LSP
   state in the network.  This concept is not explicitly defined in
   [RFC8231], but is fully compatible with it.  We use the LSP-DB to
   describe how certain actions are performed, because it is easier to
   define actions as a function of database state, rather than as a
   function of previously received messages.  The structure and format
   of the LSP-DB MUST be common among all dataplane types (i.e., RSVP-
   TE/SR-TE/SRv6), all instantiation methods (i.e., PCC-initiated/PCE-
   initiated), all destination types (i.e., point-to-point/point-to-
   multipoint).

   Note that we use the term "Tunnel" somewhat loosely here, to mean
   "the object identified by the PLSP-ID".  It may or may not be an
   actual tunnel in the implementation.  For example, working and
   protect paths can be implemented as one tunnel interface, but in PCEP
   we would refer to them as two different Tunnels, because they would
   have different PLSP-IDs.

   Note that the term "LSP", which stands for "Label Switched Path", if
   taken too literally would restrict our discussion to MPLS dataplane
   only.  In this document, we allow the term "LSP" to refer to any
   path, regardless of the dataplane format.  So that an LSP can refer
   to MPLS and SRv6 dataplane paths.

3.1.  Structure

   [RFC8231] states that the LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV contains the key that
   MUST be used to differentiate different LSPs during make before break
   procedure.  We further clarify here that PCEP LSPs exist in a 2-tier
   structure.  The top tier is the "Tunnel", identified by the PLSP-ID
   and/or SYMBOLIC-NAME, while the lower tier is the "LSP", identified
   by the values in LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV.  A single Tunnel may contain
   multiple LSPs at the same time, i.e., a Tunnel is a container for
   LSPs.  A Tunnel MUST have at least one LSP and when the last LSP is
   removed from the Tunnel, the Tunnel itself is removed.

Internet-Draft             PCEP CLARIFICATION              February 2020


3.2.  Synchronization

   The stateful PCE MUST maintain the PCE LSP-DB, which stores Tunnels
   and LSPs.  The PCE LSP DB is only modified by PCRpt messages.  No
   other PCEP message may modify the PCE LSP DB.  The PCC MUST also
   maintain the PCC LSP DB, which it MUST synchronize with the PCE LSP
   DB by sending PCRpt messages.

   The PCC adds/removes entries to/from its LSP-DB based on what LSPs it
   creates/destroys in the network.  There can be many trigger types for
   updating the PCC LSP-DB, some examples include PCUpd messages, local
   computation on the PCC, local configuration on the PCC, etc.  The
   trigger type does not affect the content of the PCC LSP-DB, i.e., the
   content of the PCC LSP-DB is updated identically regardless of the
   trigger type.

   Whenever a PCC modifies an entry it its PCC LSP-DB, it MUST send a
   PCRpt message to the PCE (or multiple PCEs), to synchronize this
   change.  Ensuring this synchronization is always in place allows one
   to define behavior as a function of LSP-DB state, instead of defining
   behavior as a function of what PCEP messages were sent or received.

   The PCE MUST always act on the latest state of the PCE LSP DB.  Note
   that this does not mean that the PCE cannot use information from
   outside of LSP-DB.  For example, the PCE can use other mechanisms to
   collect traffic statistics and use them in the computation.  However,
   these traffic statistics are not part of the LSP-DB, but only
   reference it.

   The LSP-DB on both the PCC and the PCE only stores the actual state
   in the network, it does not store the desired state.  For example,
   consider the case of PCE Initiated LSP, configured on the PCE.  When
   the operator modifies the configuration of this LSP, that is a change
   in desired state.  The actual state has not yet changed, so LSP-DB is
   not modified yet.  The LSP-DB is only modified after the PCE sends
   PCInit/PCUpd message to the PCC and the PCC decides to act on that
   message.  When the PCC acts on message, it would update its own PCC
   LSP DB and immediately send PCRpt to the PCE to synchronize the
   change.  When the PCE receives the PCRpt msg, it updates its own PCE
   LSP DB.  After this, the PCC LSP DB and PCE LSP DB are in sync.

3.3.  Stateful Bringup

   [RFC8231] in section 5.8.2, allows delegation of an LSP in
   operationally down state, but at the same time mandates the use of
   PCReq, before sending PCRpt.  In this document, we would like to make
   it clear that sending PCReq is optional.

Internet-Draft             PCEP CLARIFICATION              February 2020


   We shall refer to the process of sending PCReq before PCRpt as
   "stateless bringup".  In reality, stateless bringup introduces
   overhead and is not possible to enforce from the PCE, because the
   stateless PCE is not supposed to keep any per-LSP state about
   previous PCReq messages.  It was found that many vendors choose to
   ignore this requirement and send the PCRpt directly, without going
   through PCReq.  This section will serve to explain and to validate
   this behavior.

   Even though all the major vendors today are moving to the stateful
   PCE model, it does not deprecate the need for stateless PCEP.  The
   key property of stateless PCEP is that PCReq messages MUST NOT modify
   the state of the PCE LSP-DB in any way.  Therefore, PCReq messages
   are useful for many OAM ping/traceroute applications where the PCC
   wishes to probe the network without having any effect on the existing
   LSPs.

   The PCC MAY delegate an empty LSP to the PCE and then wait for the
   PCE to send PCUpd, without sending PCReq.  We shall refer to this
   process as "stateful bringup".  The PCE MUST support the original
   stateless bringup, for backward compatibility purposes.  Supporting
   stateful bringup should not require introducing any new behavior on
   the PCE, because as mentioned earlier, the PCE MUST NOT modify LSP-DB
   state based on PCReq messages.  So whether the PCE has received a
   PCReq or not, it MUST process the PCRpt all the same.

   An example of stateful bringup follows.  In our example the PCC
   starts off by using LSP-ID of 0.  The value 0 does not hold any
   special meaning, any other 16-bit value could have been used.

   PCC has no LSP yet, but wants to establish a path.  PCC sends
   PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, D-flag=1, OPER-FLAG=DOWN, PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=0,
   ERO={}).

     +---------------------------------------------------------------+
     | TUNNEL          | LSP                                         |

   PCC received a PCUpd from the PCE and has decided to install the
   ERO={A} from that PCUpd.  PCC sends PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, D-flag=1, OPER-
   FLAG=UP, PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=0, ERO={A}).

3.4.  Successful MBB

   Below we give an example of doing MBB to switch the tunnel from one
   path to another.  We represent the path encoded into the ERO object
   as ERO={A} and ERO={B}.

   PCC has an existing LSP in UP state, with LSP-ID=2.  PCC sends
   PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=2, ERO={A}, OPER-FLAG=UP).

     +---------------------------------------------------------------+
     | TUNNEL          | LSP                                         |
     +-----------------+---------------------------------------------+
     | PLSP-ID=100     | LSP-ID=2, ERO={A}, OPER=UP                  |
     +---------------------------------------------------------------+

                        Figure 3: Content of LSP DB

   PCC initiates the MBB procedure by creating a new LSP with LSP-ID=3.
   It does not matter what triggered the creation of the new LSP, it
   could have been due to a new path received via PCUpd (if the given
   tunnel is delegated), or it could have been local computation on the
   PCC (if the tunnel is locally computed on the PCC), or it could have
   been a change in configuration on the PCC (if the tunnel's path is
   explicitly configured on the PCC).  It is important to emphasize that
   the procedure for updating the LSP-DB is common, regardless of the
   trigger that caused the change.

   PCC sends PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=3, ERO={B}, OPER-
   FLAG=UP).

     +---------------------------------------------------------------+

   After some time, the PCC decides to destroy the old LSP.  PCC sends
   PCRpt(R-FLAG=1, PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=2).

     +---------------------------------------------------------------+
     | TUNNEL          | LSP                                         |

3.5.  Aborted MBB

   The MBB process can abort when the newly created LSP is destroyed
   before it is installed as traffic carrying.  This scenario is
   described below.

   PCC has an existing LSP in UP state, with LSP-ID=2.  PCC sends
   PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, OPER-FLAG=UP, PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=2).

     +---------------------------------------------------------------+
     | TUNNEL          | LSP                                         |

     | PLSP-ID=100     | LSP-ID=2, OPER=UP                           |
     +---------------------------------------------------------------+

                        Figure 6: Content of LSP DB

   MBB procedure is initiated, a new LSP is created with LSP-ID=3.  LSP
   is currently being established, so its oper state is DOWN.  PCC sends
   PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, OPER-FLAG=DOWN, PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=3).

     +---------------------------------------------------------------+
     | TUNNEL          | LSP                                         |

4.  PCEP Association Database

   PCEP Association is a group of zero or more LSPs.

   The PCE ASSO DB is populated by PCRpt messages and MAY also be
   populated via configuration on the PCE itself.  An Association is
   identified by the Association Parameters.  The Association parameters
   contain many fields, so for convenience we will group all the fields
   into a single value.  We will use ASSO_PARAM=A, ASSO_PARAM=B, to
   refer to different PCEP Associations: A and B, respectively.

4.1.  2 LSPs in same Association

   PCC creates the first LSP.  PCC sends PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, PLSP-ID=100,

4.2.  Switch Association during MBB

   Each new LSP (identified by the LSP-ID) does not inherit the
   Association membership of any previous LSPs within the same Tunnel.
   This is done so that a Tunnel can have two LSPs that are in different
   Associations, this may be required when switching from one
   Association to another.

   from Association A to Association B.

5.  Computation Constraints

   For any PCEP object that does not have an explicit removal flag, the
   absence of that object indicates removal of the constraint specified
   by that object.  For example, suppose the first state-report contains
   an LSPA object with some affinity constraints.  Then if a subsequent
   state-report does not contain an LSPA object, then this means that
   the previously specified affinity constraints do not apply anymore.
   Same applies to all PCEP objects, like METRIC, BANDWIDTH, etc., which
   do not have an explicit flag for removal.  This simply ensures that

   it is possible to remove a constraint without using an explicit
   removal flag.
