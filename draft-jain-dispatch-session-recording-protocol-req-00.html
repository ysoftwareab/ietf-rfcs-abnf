<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Session recording is a critical requirement in many business
      communications environments such as call centers and financial trading
      floors. In some of these environments, all calls must be recorded for
      regulatory and compliance reasons. In others, calls may be recorded for
      quality control or business analytics. Recording is typically done by
	sending a copy of the media to the recording devices. This document 
	specifies requirements for a protocol that will manage delivery of
	media from an end-point that originates media or that has access to it to 
	a recording device. This protocol is being referred to as Session
	Recording Protocol and will most likely be based on SIP.

Introduction</h3>

<p>Session recording is a critical operational requirement in many
      businesses, especially where voice is used as a medium for commerce and
      customer support. A prime example where voice is used for trade is the
      financial industry. The call recording requirements in this industry are
      quite stringent. The recorded calls are used for dispute resolution and
      compliance. Other businesses such as customer support call centers
      typically employ call recording for quality control or business
      analytics, with different requirements.
</p>
<p>Depending on the country and its regulatory requirements, financial
      trading floors typically must record all calls. The recorded media
      content must be an exact copy of the actual conversation (i.e. clipping
      and loss of media are unacceptable). A new call attempt would be
      automatically rejected if the recording device becomes temporarily
      unavailable. An existing call would be dropped in the same situation. In
      contrast, support call centers typically only record a subset of the
      calls, and calls must not fail regardless of the availability of the
      recording device.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the scale and cost burdens vary widely, in all markets,
      where the different needs for solution capabilities such as media
      injection, transcoding, and security-related needs do not conform well
      to a one-size-fits-all model. If a standardized solution supports all of
      the requirements from every recording market, but doing so would be
      expensive for markets with lesser needs, then proprietary solutions for
      those markets will continue to propagate. Care must be taken, therefore,
      to make a standards-based solution support optionality and
      flexibility.
</p>
<p>It should be noted that the requirements for the protocol between a
      Recording Server and Recording Client have very similar requirements
      (such as codec and transport negotiation, encryption key interchange,
      firewall traversal) as compared to regular SIP media sessions. The
      choice of SIP for session recording provides reuse of an existing
      protocol. This document specifies requirements for a protocol between a
      Recording Client and a Recording Server, which is most likely going to
      be SIP <a class='info' href='#RFC3261'>[RFC3261]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Schulzrinne, H., Camarillo, G., Johnston, A., Peterson, J., Sparks, R., Handley, M., and E. Schooler, &ldquo;SIP: Session Initiation Protocol,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> itself. The Recording Client is the 
	source of the recorded media. The Recording Server is the sink of the 
	recorded media.
</p>
<p>The recorded sessions can be of any kind such as voice, video and
      instant messaging. An archived session recording is typically comprised 
	of the session media content and the session metadata. The session 
	metadata allows recording archives to be searched and filtered at a 
	later time. The conveyance of session metadata from the Recording Client
	to the Recording Server may or may not be over SIP. The requirements for 
	session metadata delivery will be specified in a future revision of this 
	document or in a separate document.
</p>
<p>This document only looks into active recording, where the Recording
      Client purposefully streams media to a Recording Server. Passive
      recording, where a recording device detects media directly from the
      network, is outside the scope of this document. In addition, lawful
      intercept is outside the scope of this document.
</p>
<p>Another, related IETF draft is draft-wing-sipping-srtp-key 
	<a class='info' href='#I-D.wing-sipping-srtp-key'>[I&#8209;D.wing&#8209;sipping&#8209;srtp&#8209;key]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Wing, D., Audet, F., Fries, S., Tschofenig, H., and A. Johnston, &ldquo;Secure Media Recording and Transcoding with the Session Initiation  Protocol,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>, which
      describes an approach for providing SRTP session keys to a recorder-type
      server. That draft focuses on the mechanism to provide the SRTP session
      key, rather than the mechanism to invoke and sustain recording sessions
      themselves.
</p>
<p>There are already IETF Working Groups focusing on related or similar
      concepts: Mediactrl and Xcon. The work to address the requirements
      outlined in this draft may end up being done in those Working Groups, or
      a new one may be formed.

Definitions</h3>

<p>Recording Server (RS): A Recording Server (RS) is a specialized media
      server or collector that acts as the sink of the recorded media. An RS
      typically archives media for extended durations of time and provides
      interfaces for search and retrieval of the archived media. An RS is
      typically implemented as a multi-port device that is capable of
      receiving media from several sources simultaneously. An RS is typically
	also the sink of the recorded session metadata. Note that the term
      "Server" does not imply the RS is the server side of a signaling
      protocol - the RS may be the initiator of recording requests, for
      example.
</p>
<p>Recording Client (RC): A Recording Client (RC) is a SIP User Agent
      (UA) or a Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA) that acts as the source of 
	the recorded media, sending it to the RS. An RC is a logical function. 
	Its capabilities may be implemented across one or more physical devices. 
	In practice, an RC could be a personal device (such as a SIP phone), a 
	SIP Media Gateway (MG), a Session Border Controller (SBC) or a SIP 
	Media Server (MS) integrated with an Application Server (AS). This 
	specification defines the term RC such that all such SIP entities can 
	be generically addressed under one definition. The RC itself or another 
	entity working on its behalf (such as a SIP Application Server) may act 
	as the source of the recording metadata.
</p>
<p>Session Recording Protocol (SRP): The Session Recording Protocol
      (SRP) is a to-be-defined protocol that will be used to establish media 
	sessions between an RC and RS, for the purpose of delivering media 
	from the RC to the RS. It may, for example, be SIP.
</p>
<p>Recording Session: The session created between an RC and RS for the
      purpose of recording a Recorded Session. The Recorded Session may
      itself be based on SIP, but it is a separate session from the Recording
      Session.
</p>
<p>Recorded Session: A session created between a UAC and UAS that is 
	recorded by the RC and RS systems.
</p>
<p>Dynamic Recording: Dynamic recording is a mode of recording where the
      recording sessions are established on an as needed basis. The length
      of these sessions is typically same as the length of the actual media
      sessions.
</p>
<p>Persistent Recording: Persistent recording is a mode of recording 
	where the recording sessions are established at system start-up and 
	kept-alive from that point on. The length of these sessions is 
	independent from the length of the actual recorded media sessions. 
	Persistent recording sessions avoid issues such as media clipping that 
	can occur due to delays in recording session establishment.
</p>
<p>Business Analytics: Business analytics refers to analyzing recorded
      media and the related metadata for various kinds of business goals such
      as decision making, statistical and quantitative analysis.

General Overview</h3>

<p>Although this document discusses requirements and not solutions, 
	there are certain assumptions made regarding the solution space. One 
	goal is to support existing, deployed architectures for Session Recording. 
	Session Recording is an established practice, albeit with proprietary 
	protocols; it is the protocols between systems that this document aims at
      addressing requirements towards, in order to eventually produce an IETF
      defined protocol, or a set of protocols, for performing Session Recording
      in a non-proprietary fashion. 
</p>
<p>The current Session Recording market typically performs recording
	in one of the two ways. In some cases, a middle-box acts as a RC and sends 
	media to the recorder (RS). A simple diagram of this is shown below:

<p>
</p>
<p>In some other cases, the recording is performed from an endpoint (RC) 
	to a recorder (RS). A simple diagram of this is shown below:

</p>
<p>In some deployments the RS notifies the RC when to record a session,
      which requires the RS to have some means of identifying that a session
      is taking place and how to reference the particular session to record.
      In other cases, the RC notifies the RS when it wants to record a
      session. In both cases, there is often a separate connection, or even
      separate protocol, for communicating metadata about a session, distinct
      from the protocol connection used for communicating the recording
      information.

Requirements</h3>

<p>The basic requirements for the Session Recording Protocol can be
      summarized as follows:
</p>
<p>o REQ-001 The mechanism MUST support the ability to perform
      persistent (always-on) or dynamic (on-demand) Recording Sessions.
</p>
<p>o REQ-002 The mechanism MUST support the ability to perform persistent
      Recording Sessions, such that the connection and attributes of media in
      the Recording Session are not dynamically signaled for each Recorded
      Session before it can be recorded. Call details and metadata will still
      be signaled, but can be post-correlated to the recorded media. There
      will still need to be a means of correlating the recorded media
      connection/packets to the Recorded Session, however this may be on a
      permanent filter-type basis, such as based on a SIP AoR of an agent that
      is always recorded, or based on identifiers in the recorded media
      itself.
</p>
<p>o REQ-003 The mechanism MUST support establishing Recording Sessions
      from the RC to the RS. This requirement typically applies when the
      decision on whether a session should be recorded or not resides in the
      RC.
</p>
<p>o REQ-004 The mechanism MUST support establishing Recording
      Sessions from the RS to the RC. This requirement typically applies when
      the decision on whether a session should be recorded or not resides in
      the RS.
</p>
<p>o REQ-005 The mechanism SHOULD support loss less delivery of media
      content from RC to the RS. Note that the specific use of recording will
      dictate the integrity of the media. Trading floors or financial offices
      will prefer complete loss less delivery of media whereas call centers,
      for instance, may tolerate some media loss.
</p>
<p>o REQ-006 The mechanism SHOULD support means to avoid clipping media
      (leading or trailing samples) when the media is transported from the RC 
	to the RS.
</p>
<p>Note: Media clipping can occur due to delays in recording session
      establishment. RC implementations typically buffer some portion of the
      media to overcome this problem.
</p>
<p>o REQ-007 The mechanism SHOULD support RS failover and migration of
      Recording Sessions to a working RS without disconnecting the Recorded 
	Sessions.
</p>
<p>o REQ-008 The mechanism MUST support a means of providing security
      (confidentiality, integrity and authentication) for the SRP.
</p>
<p>o REQ-009 The mechanism MUST support the ability to deliver mixed
      media streams to the RS. The RS MAY be informed about the composition of
      the mixed streams through session metadata.
</p>
<p>Note: A mixed media stream is where several recorded sessions are 
	carried in a single recording session. A mixed media stream is typically 
	produced by a mixer function.
</p>
<p>o REQ-010 The mechanism MUST support the ability to deliver multiple 
	media streams for a given Recorded Session over separate Recording Sessions 
	to the RS.
</p>
<p>o REQ-011 The mechanism MUST support the ability to deliver multiple 
	media streams for a given Recorded Session over a single Recording Session
	to the RS.
</p>
<p>o REQ-012 The mechanism MUST support the ability to pause and resume
      the Recording Session either from RC or from the RS.
</p>
<p>o REQ-013 The mechanism MUST support the ability to inject tones into
      the Recorded Session either from the RS or from the RC.
</p>
<p>o REQ-014 If SIP <a class='info' href='#RFC3261'>[RFC3261]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Schulzrinne, H., Camarillo, G., Johnston, A., Peterson, J., Sparks, R., Handley, M., and E. Schooler, &ldquo;SIP: Session Initiation Protocol,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> is chosen as the Session 
	Recording Protocol, there MUST be a way for the Recording Session to 
	identify itself as a SIP session that is established for the purpose 
	of recording. This will provide a way to disambiguate the Recording 
	Session from the Recorded Session.
</p>
<p>o REQ-015 The mechanism MUST support the ability to provide
      authentication, eavesdropping protections, and non-repudiation for the
      media sent in the Recording Session, between the RC and RS.
</p>
<p>o REQ-016 The mechanism MUST support the ability to provide
      authorization and authentication of the RS to the RC, and the RC to the
      RS.
</p>
<p>o REQ-017 The mechanism MUST support the ability to provide
      eavesdropping protection and non-repudiation for the SRP.
</p>
<p>o REQ-018 The mechanism MUST support the ability to correlate the SRP
      request to record a call, with the session being recorded.
</p>
<p>o REQ-019 The mechanism MUST support the ability to correlate the SRP
      request to record specific media sessions, with the SIP session and
      media to be recorded.
</p>
<p>o REQ-020 The mechanism MUST support the ability to have a separate
      session/connection for the Session Recording Protocol, from that for the
      Session Metadata transport.
</p>
<p>o REQ-021 The mechanism MUST support the ability for the RC to
      only perform media replication to the RS, without needing to decode or
      mix audio/video/etc., and without needing to be an RTP agent. This will 
	allow the RC to replicate media at layers below RTP. Clearly, such an RC 
	mode would not be able to provide transcoding, or media injection from 
	the RS back into the Recorded Session.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>Session recording has substantial security implications, both for the
      SIP UA's being recorded, and for the Session Recording Protocol itself
      in terms of the RC and RS.
</p>
<p>For the SIP UA's involved in the Recorded Session, the requirements
      listed in this draft enable recording such that consent may not be asked
      for, and instead they may be "silently" recorded without the knowledge
      of the UA's. To some, this may smack of a form of (un)Lawful
      Interception, which the IETF has explicitly ruled out of scope, due to
      the nationally-specific variances in LI requirements (see <a class='info' href='#RFC2804'>[RFC2804]<span> (</span><span class='info'>IAB and IESG, &ldquo;IETF Policy on Wiretapping,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>).
      This is not the case with Session Recording. Session Recording has
      requirements dictated by market needs, just as any IETF-defined protocol
      does, and they are not nationally-specific. Session Recording may be
      limited or constrained by nationally-specific restrictions, but such is
      true of any communication protocols. For example, they typically require
      the recorded users be notified of the recording taking place. This is
      done in the media itself through voice announcements, since humans don't
      typically look at or know about protocol signaling such as SIP, and
      indeed the SIP session might have originated through a PSTN Gateway
      without any ability to pass on in-signaling indications of
      recording.
</p>
<p>With regards to security implications of the protocol(s), clearly
      there is a need for authentication, authorization, eavesdropping
      protection, and non-repudiation for the solution. The RC needs to know
      the RS it is communicating with is legitimate, and vice-versa, even if
      they are in different domains. Both the signaling and media for the SRP
      needs the ability to be authenticated and protected from eavesdropping
      and non-repudiation. Requirements for this are detailed in the
      requirements section.
