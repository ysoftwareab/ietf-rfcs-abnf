Internet-Draft Requirements on Multipath Routing Protocols December 2015


Abstract

   This document describes the requirements on the protocols providing
   multiple routes between a given source and destination node pair
   in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET). For this, the conditions to be
   considered in defining a MANET multipath routing protocol are
   listed.

Internet-Draft Requirements on Multipath Routing Protocols December 2015


1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   
2.  Introduction

   The mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is composed of a number of mobile
   nodes which can communicate with each other through multiple
   wireless links without the help of a wired infrastructure.
   Therefore, in the MANET, the route connectivity tends to be very
   unstable. This route unstability can be mitigated by providing more
   than one route to a source and destination node pair. In recent
   years, there have been intensive studies done on multipath routing
   protocols for the MANET [1]. Also, multipath routing protocols may
   have the advantage of providing load balancing by distributing data
   traffic to a number of routes. On the other hand, it may incur more
   control message overhead to set up multiple routes.

   In this draft, we define the requirements on MANET multipath
   routing protocols.


3.  Requirements on MANET Multipath Routing Protocols

   MANET multipath routing protocols MAY consider the following
   conditions:

   - the number of routes for a given pair of source and destination
     nodes
   - the disjointness of the routes between a source and destination
     node pair
   - the control message overhead for establishing a given number of
     routes
   - the base MANET unicast routing protocol, such as AODV [2] or DSR
     [3], on which the multipath routing protocol is defined
   - the degree of changes on the base MANET unicast routing protocol

   With considering the above-mentioned conditions, a MANET multipath
   routing protocol SHOULD satisfy the following requirements:

Internet-Draft Requirements on Multipath Routing Protocols December 2015


   - The control message overhead incurred by a MANET multipath routing
     protocol SHOULD NOT overwhelm the data traffic in the network.
     Or, more definitively, it SHOULD NOT exceed a certain portion of
     the total amount of the network traffic. The latter is more
     definitive, but achieving this may not be feasible.
   - The modifications and/or extensions on the base MANET unicast
     routing protocol SHOULD NOT hinder the operation of the base MANET
     unicast routing protocol.
   - The number of routes provided for a given source and destination
     node pair SHOULD be controlled adaptively so that the multiple
     routes do not increase the amount of routing information
     maintained in a router unnecessarily.
 
  
4.  Other Considerations

   TBD
