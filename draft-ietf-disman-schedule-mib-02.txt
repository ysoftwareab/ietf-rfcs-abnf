Internet-Draft                Schedule MIB                    March 1998


1.  Abstract

   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   the Internet community. In particular, it describes a set of managed
   objects that are used to schedule management operations periodically
   or at specified dates and times.

   This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet community.



2.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Network Management Framework presently consists of three
   major components. They are:

   o    the SMI, described in RFC 1902 [1], RFC 1903 [2] - the
        mechanisms used for describing and naming objects for the
        purpose of management.

   o    the MIB-II, STD 17, RFC 1213 [3] - the core set of managed
        objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

   o    the protocol, RFC 1157 [4] and/or RFC 1905 [5], RFC 1906 [6]
        and/or RFC 2272 [7], RFC 2274 [8] - the protocol for accessing
        managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.



2.1.  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI[1]. In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name. The object type
   together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object. For human convenience, we often
   use a textual string, termed the object descriptor, to refer to the
   object type.

3.  Overview

   The MIB defined in this memo provides scheduling of actions
   periodically or at specified dates and times. The actions can be used
   to realize on-duty / off-duty schedules or to trigger management
   functions in a DISMAN application.

   Schedules can be enabled or disabled by modifying a control object.
   This allows to have pre-configured schedules available that are
   activated or de-activated by some other management functions.


3.1.  Periodic Schedules


   Periodic schedules are based on fixed time periods between the
   initiation of scheduled actions. Periodic schedules are defined by
   specifying the number of seconds between two initiations. The time
   needed to complete the action is usually not known by the scheduler
   and does therefore not influence the next scheduling point.

   Implementations must guarantee that action invocations will not occur
   before their next scheduled time.  However, implementations may be
   forced to delay invocations in the face of local constraints (e.g., a
   heavy load on higher-priority tasks).  An accumulation of such delays
   would result in a drift of the scheduling interval with respect to
   time, and should be avoided.

   Scheduled actions collecting statistical data should retrieve time
   stamps from the data source and not rely on the accuracy of the
   periodic scheduler in order to obtain accurate statistics.


3.2.  Calendar Schedules

   Calendar schedules trigger scheduled actions at specified dates and
   times. Calendar schedules are therefore aware of the notion of
   months, days, weekdays, hours and minutes.

   It is possible to specify multiple values for each calendar item.
   This provides a mechanism for defining complex schedules.  For
   example, a schedule could be defined which triggers an action every
   15 minutes on a given weekday.

3.3.  Actions

   Scheduled actions are modeled by SNMP set operations on local MIB
   variables. Scheduled actions described in this MIB are further
   restricted to objects of type INTEGER. This restriction does not
   limit the usefulness of the MIB.  Simple schedules such as on-duty /
   off-duty schedules for resources that have a status MIB object (e.g.
   ifAdminStatus) are possible.

   More complex actions can be realized by triggering a management
   script which is responsible for performing complex state transitions.
   A management script can also be used to perform SNMP set operations
   on remote SNMP engines.

5.  Security Considerations

   Scheduled SNMP set operations must use the security credentials that
   were present when the corresponding row in the scheduler was created.
   An implementation must therefore record and maintain the credentials
   for every schedule. An implementation must also ensure that access
   control rules are applied when doing the set operation.

   This MIB limits scheduled actions to objects in the local MIB. This
   avoids some security problems with delegated access rights. However,
   it might be possible for a user of this MIB to own some schedules
   that might trigger far in the future. This can cause security risks
   if the security administrator did not properly update the access
   control lists when a user is withdrawn from an SNMP engine.

Internet-Draft                Schedule MIB                    March 1998


   Therefore, it is suggested that entries in the schedTable be cleaned
   up whenever a user is removed from an SNMP engine.

   The MIB is structured according to the guidelines defined in the
   DISMAN framework. These guidelines allow access control rules to be
   defined which separate multiple users of this MIB from each other.

10.  Changes from <draft-ietf-disman-schedule-mib-00>


   o    Clarifications about drifts between initiations of action in a
        periodic scheduler.

   o    Made the registration of the notification reversible.

   o    Changed the syntax of schedInterval from TimeInterval to
        Unsigned32.  The maximum resolution is now seconds instead of
        hundreds of a second.

   o    The conformance statement makes objects for the calendar-based
        scheduler optional.

   o    Minor changes to make the MIB compile with smicng.



11.  Changes from <draft-ietf-disman-schedule-mib-01>


   o    Updated the section about the SNMP management framework and
        added references to SNMPv3.

   o    Replaced Utf8String with SnmpAdminString.

   o    Added Intellectual Property section.

   o    Changed some wordings to make the text more readable.
