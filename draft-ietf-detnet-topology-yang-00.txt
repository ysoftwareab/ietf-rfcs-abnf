1.  Introduction

   Deterministic Networking (DetNet) [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture] is
   defined to provide high-quality network service with extremely low
   packet loss rate, bounded low latency and jitter.

   DetNet YANG [RFC7950] [RFC6991] models are used for DetNet service
   configuration, QoS configuration and topology discovery.  DetNet
   service and QoS configuration models are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-yang].  This document defines DetNet topology model
   that can be used for DetNet topology/capability discovery and device
   configuration.  DetNet topology model is an augmentation of the ietf-
   te-toplogy model [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te-topo].

2.  Terminologies

   This document uses the terminologies defined in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture].

3.  DetNet Topology Model

   A DetNet topology is composed of a set of DetNet nodes and DetNet
   links.  DetNet nodes represent the network devices that can transport
   DetNet services, which are connected by DetNet links.  A DetNet Link
   Terminate Point(LTP) is the connection point between a DetNet node
   and a DetNet link, which represents the port or interface of a DetNet
   node.  The concept of DetNet node/link/LTP are similar as TE
   node/link/LTP which are defined in [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te-topo].

   Figure 1 shows a simple DetNet topology: A is a DetNet node, B is
   DetNet a LTP, and C is a DetNet link.

                   Figure 1. An example of DetNet Topology

   DetNet topology model (ietf-detnet-topology) augments ietf-te-
   topology model [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te-topo] to cover the following
   groups of attributes, which are necessary for supporting DetNet
   congestion protection and service protection:

   o  Bandwidth related attributes (e.g., bandwidth reserved for
      DetNet);

   o  Buffer/queue management related attributes (e.g., queue management
      parameters, etc.);

   o  PREOF (Packet Replication, Elimination and Ordering Function)
      capabilities and parameters (e.g., maximum out-of-order packets,
      etc.);

   o  Delay related attributes (e.g., node processing delay, queuing
      delay, link delay, etc.);

   The above attributes are categorized into three types: node
   attributes, link attributes and LTP attributes.  The detailed
   descriptions and model definitions are specified in section 3.1, 3.2
   and 3.3, respectively.

3.1.  DetNet Node Attributes

   Section 4.3 of [I-D.finn-detnet-bounded-latency] gives a DetNet time
   model, which defines that the delay within a node includes five
   parts: processing delay, regulation delay, queuing delay, output
   delay and preemption delay.  The processing delay, queuing delay and
   regulation delay are variable in general, but for DetNet, these
   delays should be bounded, which is the basic assumption of
   deterministic networking.  These bounded delay parameters are
   necessary to perform DetNet path computation.  Among this delay
   attributes, processing delay and regulation delay are node relevant,
   and the queuing delay is LTP relevant.  In addition, in order to
   simplify the model and implementation, the processing delay and
   regulation delay are combined as processing delay, and the preemption
   delay is included in queuing delay.  [Editor notes: more comments and
   inputs need here].

   For the DetNet node attributes, the following variables are
   introduced:

   o  Maximum DetNet packet processing delay

   o  Minimum DetNet packet processing delay

   o  Maximum DetNet packet processing delay variation

   The modeling structure is shown below:

  augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node/tet:te/tet:te-node-attributes:
     +--rw detnet-node-attributes
        +--rw minimum-packet-processing-delay?             uint32
        +--rw maximum-packet-processing-delay?             uint32
        +--rw maximum-packet-processing-delay-variation?   uint32

3.2.  DetNet Link Attributes

   DetNet link attributes include link delay and link bandwidth for
   DetNet.  This document introduces the following link related
   attributes:

   o  Link delay: link delay is a constant that only depends on the
      physical connection.  It has been defined in ietf-te-topology
      [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te-topo], and DetNet can reuse it directly.

   o  Maximum DetNet reservable bandwidth: the maximum reservable
      bandwidth that is allocated to DetNet.  For a 10G link, if 50% of
      the bandwidth is allocated to DetNet, then the maximum DetNet

Internet-Draft                DetNet Model                  January 2019


      reservable bandwidth is 5G.  That means there are 5G bandwidth
      that can be used by DetNet flows.

   o  Reserved DetNet bandwidth: the bandwidth that has been reserved
      for DetNet flows.

   o  Available DetNet bandwidth: the bandwidth that is available for
      new DetNet flows.

   The DetNet link attributes are modeled within a link, and the YANG
   module structure is shown below:

  augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nt:link/tet:te/tet:te-link-attributes:
     +--rw detnet-link-attributes
        +--rw maximum-reservable-bandwidth
        |  +--rw te-bandwidth
        |     +--rw (technology)?
        |        +--:(generic)
        |           +--rw generic?   te-bandwidth
        +--rw reserved-detnet-bandwidth
        |  +--rw te-bandwidth
        |     +--rw (technology)?
        |        +--:(generic)
        |           +--rw generic?   te-bandwidth
        +--rw available-detnet-bandwidth
           +--rw te-bandwidth
              +--rw (technology)?
                 +--:(generic)
                    +--rw generic?   te-bandwidth

3.3.  DetNet Link Terminate Point Attributes

   The concept of LTP is introduced in [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te-topo], and
   this section introduces attributes for DetNet LTP.

   PREOF (Packet Replication/Elimination/Ordering Function) is for
   DetNet service protection, which includes :

   o  In-order delivery function: defined in Section 3.2.2.1 of
      [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture]

   o  Packet replication function: defined in Section 3.2.2.2 of
      [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture]

   o  Packet elimination function: defined in Section 3.2.2.3 of
      [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture]

Internet-Draft                DetNet Model                  January 2019


   The above functions are modeled as a set of capabilities and relevant
   parameters, which are listed below:

   o  in-order-capability: indicates whether a LTP has the in-order
      delivery capability.

   o  maximum-number-of-out-of-order-packets: indicates the maximum
      number of out-of-order packets that an LTP can support, it depends
      on the reserved buffer size for packet reordering.

   o  replication-capability: indicates whether a LTP has the packet
      replication capability.

   o  elimination-capability: indicates whether a LTP has the packet
      elimination capability.

   In addition, DetNet LTP also includes queuing management algorithms
   and queuing delay attributes.  In the context of DetNet, the delay of
   queuing is bounded, and the bound depends on what queuing management
   method is used and how many buffers are allocated.  More information
   can be found in [I-D.finn-detnet-bounded-latency].  Queuing related
   attributes are listed below:

   o  queuing-algorithm-capabilities: it is modeled as a list that
      includes all queuing algorithms that a LTP supports.

   o  detnet-queues: it's modeled as a list that includes all queues of
      a DetNet LTP.  For each queue, it has the following attributes:

   o  queue-identifier: an identifier of a queue.  It could be an
      internal identifier that is only used within a node.  Or it could
      be used by a centralized controller to specify in which specific
      queue a flow/packet is required to enter.

   o  queue-buffer-size: the size of a queue with unit of bytes.

   o  enabled-queuing-algorithm: indicates what queuing management
      algorithm is enabled.

   o  maximum-queuing-delay: the maximum queuing delay that a packet
      will undergo when transmitted through the queue.

   o  minimum-queuing-delay: the minimum queuing delay that a packet
      will undergo when transmitted through the queue.

   o  maximum-queuing-delay-variation: the maximum queuing delay
      variation that a packet will undergo when transmitted the queue.

6.  Open Issues

   There are some open issues that are still under discussion:

   o  The Relationship with 802.1 TSN YANG models is TBD.  TSN YANG
      models include: P802.1Qcw, which defines TSN YANG for Qbv, Qbu,
      and Qci, and P802.1CBcv, which defines YANG for 802.1CB.  The
      possible problem here is how to avoid possible overlap among yang
      models defined in IETF and IEEE.  A common YANG model may be
      defined in the future to shared by both TSN and DetNet.  More
      discussion are needed here.

   o  How to support DetNet OAM is TBD.

   These issues will be resolved in the following versions of the draft.
