Abstract

    The COMPRESS=DEFLATE extension allows an IMAP connection to be
    compressed using the DEFLATE algorithm, such that effective
    compression is available even when TLS is used.

    [KEYWORDS]. Formal syntax is defined by [ABNF] as modified by
    [IMAP].

    In the example, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
    server respectively.


Introduction and Overview

    An IMAP server that supports this extension announces
    "COMPRESS=DEFLATE" as one of its capabilities.

    The goal of COMPRESS=DEFLATE is to reduce the bandwidth usage of
    IMAP.  On regular IMAP connections, the PPP or MNP compression used
    with many low-bandwidth links compresses IMAP well. However, when
    TLS is used, PPP/MNP compression is ineffective. TLS too may provide
    compression, but few or no implementations do so in practice
    (perhaps for patent reasons).

    In order to increase interoperation, it is desirable to have as few
    different compression algorithms as possible, so this document
    specifies only one.  The DEFLATE algorithm is standard, widely
    available, unencumbered by patents and fairly efficient.  Hopefully
    it will not be necessary to define additional algorithms.

    The extension adds one new command (COMPRESS) and no new responses.


The COMPRESS Command

    Arguments: Name of compression mechanism: "DEFLATE".

    Responses: None

    Result: OK    The server will compress its responses and expects the
                  client to compress its commands.
            NO    The connection already is compressed, or the server doesn't
                  support the requested mechanism.
            BAD   Command unknown or invalid argument.

    The COMPRESS command instructs the server to use the named
    compression mechanism ("DEFLATE" is the only one defined) for future
    commands and responses.

    For DEFLATE (as for many other compression mechanisms), the
    compressor can trade speed against quality.  When decompressing
    there isn't much of a tradeoff.  Consequently, the client and server
    are both free to pick the best reasonable rate of compression for

    the data they send.

    The client MUST NOT send additional commands until it has seen the
    result of COMPRESS.

    If both TLS and COMPRESS are in use, the data should be compressed
    before it is encrypted (and decrypted before it is decompressed).


Example

    This example shows a simple login sequence. The client uses TLS for
    privacy and [DEFLATE] for compression.

         S: * OK [CAPABILITY IMAP4REV1 STARTTLS COMPRESS=DEFLATE]
         C: a starttls
         S: a OK
         C: b compress deflate
         S: b OK
         C: c login arnt tnra
         S: c OK


Implementation Notes

    When using the zlib library (see [DEFLATE]), the functions
    deflateInit(), deflate(), inflateInit() and inflate() suffice to
    implement this extension.

    Note that when using TLS, compression may actually decrease the CPU
    usage, depending on which algorithms are used in TLS. This is
    because fewer bytes need to be encrypted, and encryption is
    generally more expensive than compression.


Formal Syntax

    The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
    Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [ABNF]. Non-terminals
    referenced but not defined below are as defined by [ABNF] (SP, CRLF)
    or [IMAP] (all others).

    Except as noted otherwise, all alphabetic characters are case-
    insensitive.  The use of upper or lower case characters to define
    token strings is for editorial clarity only.  Implementations MUST
    accept these strings in a case-insensitive fashion.

IANA considerations

    The IANA is requested to add COMPRESS=DEFLATE to the list of IMAP
    extensions.
