           Analysis of the 64-bit Boundary in IPv6 Addressing
                     draft-carpenter-6man-why64-01

Abstract

   The IPv6 unicast addressing format includes a separation between the
   prefix used to route packets to a subnet and the interface identifier
   used to specify a given interface connected to that subnet.
   Historically the interface identifier has been defined as 64 bits
   long, leaving 64 bits for the prefix.  This document discusses the
   reasons for this fixed boundary and the issues involved in treating
   it as a variable boundary.

1.  Introduction

   IPv6 addresses were originally chosen to be 128 bits long to provide
   flexibility and new possibilities, rather than simply relieving the
   IPv4 address shortage by doubling the address size to 64 bits.  The
   notion of a 64-bit boundary in the address was introduced after the
   initial design was done.  There were two motivations for introducing
   it.  One was the original "8+8" proposal [DRAFT-odell] that
   eventually led to ILNP [RFC6741], which required a fixed point for



Carpenter, et al.        Expires August 10, 2014                [Page 2]

   the split between local and wide-area parts of the address.  The
   other was the expectation that EUI-64 MAC addresses would become
   widespread in place of 48-bit addresses, coupled with the plan at
   that time that auto-configured addresses would normally be based on
   interface identifiers derived from MAC addresses.

   The IPv6 addressing architecture [RFC4291] specifies that a unicast
   address is divided into n bits of subnet prefix followed by (128-n)
   bits of interface identifier (IID).  Since IPv6 routing is entirely
   based on variable length subnet masks, there is no architectural
   assumption that n has any particular fixed value.  However, RFC 4291
   also describes a method of forming interface identifiers from IEEE
   EUI-64 hardware addresses [IEEE802] and this does specify that such
   interface identifiers are 64 bits long.  Various other methods of
   forming interface identifiers also specify a length of 64 bits.  This
   has therefore become the de facto length of almost all IPv6 interface
   identifiers.  One exception is documented in [RFC6164], which
   standardises 127-bit prefixes for inter-router links.

   Recently it has been clarified that the bits in an IPv6 interface
   identifier have no particular meaning and should be treated as opaque
   values [I-D.ietf-6man-ug].  Therefore, there are no bit positions in
   the currently used 64 bits that need to be preserved.  The addressing
   architecture as modified by [I-D.ietf-6man-ug] now states that "For
   all unicast addresses, except those that start with the binary value
   000, Interface IDs are required to be 64 bits long.  If derived from
   an IEEE MAC-layer address, they must be constructed in Modified
   EUI-64 format."

   The question is often asked why the boundary is set rigidly at /64.
   This limits the length of a routing prefix to 64 bits, whereas
   architecturally, and from the point of view of routing protocols, it
   could be anything (in theory) between /1 and /128 inclusive.  Here,
   we only discuss the question of a shorter IID, allowing a longer
   routing prefix.

   The purpose of this document is to analyse the issues around this
   question.  We make no proposal for change, but we do analyse the
   possible effects of a change.

2.  Scenarios for prefixes longer than /64

   In this section we describe existing scenarios where prefixes longer
   than /64 have been used or proposed.

2.1.  Insufficient address space delegated

   A site may not be delegated a sufficiently large prefix from which to
   allocate a /64 prefix to all of its internal subnets.  In this case
   the site may either determine that it does not have enough address
   space to number all its network elements and thus, at the very best,
   be only partially operational, or it may choose to use internal
   prefixes longer than /64 to allow multiple subnets and the hosts
   within them to be configured with addresses.

   In this case, the site might choose, for example, to use a /80 per
   subnet, in combination with hosts using either manually configured
   addressing or DHCPv6.

   Scenarios that have been suggested where an insufficient prefix might
   be delegated include home or small office networks, vehicles,
   building services and transportation services (road signs, etc.).  It
   should be noted that the homenet architecture text
   [I-D.ietf-homenet-arch] states that a CPE should consider the lack of
   sufficient address space to be an error condition, rather than using
   prefixes longer than /64 internally.

   Another scenario occasionally suggested is one where the Internet
   address registries actually begin to run out of IPv6 prefix space,
   such that operators can no longer assign reasonable prefixes to users
   in accordance with [RFC6177].  We mention this scenario here for
   completeness, and we briefly analyze it in Section 7.

2.2.  Concerns over ND cache exhaustion

   A site may be concerned that it is open to neighbour discovery (ND)
   cache exhaustion attacks, whereby an attacker sends a large number of
   messages in rapid succession to a series of (most likely inactive)
   host addresses within a specific subnet, in an attempt to fill a
   router's ND cache with ND requests pending completion, in so doing
   denying correct operation to active devices on the network.

   An example would be to use a /120 prefix, limiting the number of
   addresses in the subnet to be similar to an IPv4 /24 prefix, which
   should not cause any concerns for ND cache exhaustion.  Note that the
   prefix does need to be quite long for this scenario to be valid.  The
   number of theoretically possible ND cache slots on the segment needs
   to be of the same order of magnitude as the actual number of hosts.
   Thus small increases from the /64 prefix length do not have a
   noticeable impact: even 2^32 potential entries, a factor of two
   billion decrease compared to 2^64, is still more than enough to
   exhaust the memory on current routers.

Internet-Draft                   Why 64                    February 2014


   As in the previous scenario, hosts would likely be manually
   configured with addresses, or use DHCPv6.

   It should be noted that several other mitigations of the ND cache
   attack are described in [RFC6583], and that limiting the size of the
   cache and the number of incomplete entries allowed would also defeat
   the attack.

3.  Interaction with IPv6 specifications

   The precise 64-bit length of the Interface ID is widely mentioned in
   numerous RFCs describing various aspects of IPv6.  It is not
   straightforward to distinguish cases where this has normative impact
   or affects interoperability.  This section aims to identify
   specifications that contain an explicit reference to the 64-bit size.
   Regardless of implementation issues, the RFCs themselves would all
   need to be updated if the 64-bit rule was changed, even if the
   updates were small.

   First and foremost, the RFCs describing the architectural aspects of
   IPv6 addressing explicitly state, refer and repeat this apparently
   immutable value: Addressing Architecture [RFC4291], Reserved
   Interface Identifiers [RFC5453], ILNP [RFC6741].  Customer Edge
   routers impose /64 for their interfaces [RFC7084].  Only the IPv6
   Subnet Model [RFC5942] refers to the assumption of /64 prefix length
   as a potential implementation error.

   Numerous IPv6-over-foo documents make mandatory statements with
   respect to the 64-bit length of the Interface ID to be used during
   the Stateless Autoconfiguration.  These documents include [RFC2464]
   (Ethernet), [RFC2467] (FDDI), [RFC2470] (Token Ring), [RFC2492]
   (ATM), [RFC2497] (ARCnet), [RFC2590] (Frame Relay), [RFC3146] (IEEE
   1394), [RFC4338] (Fibre Channel), [RFC4944] (IEEE 802.15.4),
   [RFC5072] (PPP), [RFC5121] [RFC5692] (IEEE 802.16), [RFC2529]
   (6over4), [RFC5214] (ISATAP), [I-D.templin-aerolink] (AERO),
   [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-btle], [I-D.ietf-6man-6lobac],
   [I-D.brandt-6man-lowpanz].

   To a lesser extent, the address configuration RFCs themselves may in
   some way assume the 64-bit length of an Interface ID (SLAAC for the
   link-local addresses, DHCPv6 for the potentially assigned
   EUI-64-based IP addresses, Default Router Preferences [RFC4191] for
   its impossibility of Prefix Length 4, Optimistic Duplicate Address
   Detection [RFC4429] which computes 64-bit-based collision
   probabilities).

   The MLDv2 protocol [RFC3810] mandates all queries be sent with the
   fe80::/64 link-local source address prefix and subsequently bases the

   querier election algorithm on the link-local subnet prefix length of
   length /64.

   The IPv6 Flow Label Specification [RFC6437] gives an example of a
   20-bit hash function generation which relies on splitting an IPv6
   address in two equally-sized 64bit-length parts.

   The basic transition mechanisms [RFC4213] refer to IIDs of length 64
   for link-local addresses, and other transition mechanisms such as
   Teredo [RFC4380] assume the use of IIDs of length 64.  Similar
   assumptions are found in 6to4 [RFC3056] and 6rd [RFC5969].
   Translation-based transition mechanisms such as NAT64 and NPTv6 have
   some dependency on prefix length, discussed below.

   The proposed method [I-D.ietf-v6ops-64share] of extending an assigned
   /64 prefix from a smartphone's cellular interface to its WiFi link
   relies on prefix length, and implicitely on the length of the
   Interface ID, to be valued at 64.

   The CGA and HBA specifications rely on the 64-bit identifier length
   (see below), as do the Privacy extensions [RFC4941] and some examples
   in IKEv2bis [RFC5996].

   464XLAT [RFC6877] explicitly mentions acquiring /64 prefixes.
   However, it also discusses the possibility of using the interface
   address on the device as the endpoint for the traffic, thus
   potentially removing this dependency.

   [RFC2526] reserves a number of subnet anycast addresses by reserving
   some anycast IIDs.  An anycast IID so reserved cannot be less than 7
   bits long.  This means that a subnet prefix length longer than /121
   is not possible, and a subnet of exactly /121 would be useless since
   all its identifiers are reserved.  It also means that half of a /120
   is reserved for anycast.  This could of course be fixed in the way
   described for /127 in [RFC6164], i.e., avoiding the use of anycast
   within a /120 subnet.

   While preparing this document, it was noted that many other IPv6
   specifications refer to mandatory alignment on 64-bit boundaries,
   64-bit data structures, 64-bit counters in MIBs, 64-bit sequence
   numbers and cookies in security, etc.  Finally, the number "64" may
   be considered "magic" in some RFCs, e.g., 64k limits in DNS and
   Base64 encodings in MIME.  None of this has any influence on the
   length of the IID, but might confuse a careless reader.

4.  Possible areas of breakage

   This section discusses several specific aspects of IPv6 where we can
   expect operational breakage with subnet prefixes other than /64.

   o  Multicast: [RFC3306] defines a method for generating IPv6
      multicast group addresses based on unicast prefixes.  This method
      assumes a longest network prefix of 64 bits.  If a longer prefix
      is used, there is no way to generate a specific multicast group
      address using this method.  In such cases the administrator would
      need to use an "artificial" prefix from within their allocation (a
      /64 or shorter) from which to generate the group address.  This
      prefix would not correspond to a real subnet.

      Similarly [RFC3956], which specifies Embedded-RP, allowing IPv6
      multicast rendezvous point addresses to be embedded in the
      multicast group address, would also fail, as the scheme assumes a
      maximum prefix length of 64 bits.

   o  CGA: The Cryptographically Generated Address format (CGA,
      [RFC3972]) is heavily based on a /64 interface identifier.
      [RFC3972] has defined a detailed algorithm how to generate 64-bit
      interface identifier from a public key and a 64-bit subnet prefix.
      Breaking the /64 boundary would certainly break the current CGA
      definition.  However, CGA might benefit in a redefined version if
      more bits are used for interface identifier (which means shorter
      prefix length).  For now, 59 bits are used for cryptographic
      purposes.  The more bits are available, the stronger CGA could be.
      Conversely, longer prefixes would weaken CGA.

   o  NAT64: Both stateless [RFC6052] NAT64 and stateful NAT64 [RFC6146]
      are flexible for the prefix length.  [RFC6052] has defined
      multiple address formats for NAT64.  In Section 2 "IPv4-Embedded
      IPv6 Prefix and Format" of [RFC6052], the network-specific prefix
      could be one of /32, /40, /48, /56, /64 and /96.  The remaining
      part of the IPv6 address is constructed by a 32-bit IPv4 address,
      a 8-bit u byte and a variable length suffix (there is no u byte
      and suffix in the case of 96-bit Well-Known Prefix).  NAT64 is
      therefore OK with a boundary out to /96, but not longer.

   o  NPTv6: IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix Translation [RFC6296] is also
      bound to /64 boundary.  NPTv6 maps a /64 prefix with other /64
      prefix.  When the NPTv6 Translator is configured with a /48 or
      shorter prefix, the 64-bit interface identifier is kept unmodified
      during translation.  However, the /64 boundary might be broken as
      long as the "inside" and "outside" prefix has the same length.

Internet-Draft                   Why 64                    February 2014


   o  ILNP: Identifier-Locator Network Protocol (ILNP) [RFC6741] is
      designed around the /64 boundary, since it relies on locally
      unique 64-bit interface identifiers.  While a re-design to use
      longer prefixes is not inconceivable, this would need major
      changes to the existing specification for the IPv6 version of
      ILNP.

   o  shim6: The Multihoming Shim Protocol for IPv6 (shim6) [RFC5533] in
      its insecure form treats IPv6 address as opaque 128-bit objects.
      However, to secure the protocol against spoofing, it is essential
      to either use CGAs (see above) or Hash-Based Addresses (HBA)
      [RFC5535].  Like CGAs, HBAs are generated using a procedure that
      assumes a 64-bit identifier.  Therefore, in effect, secure shim6
      is affected by the /64 boundary exactly like CGAs.

   o  others?

   It goes without saying that if prefixes longer than /64 are to be
   used, all hosts must be capable of generating IIDs shorter than 64
   bits, in order to follow the auto-configuration procedure correctly
   [RFC4862].  There is however the rather special case of the link-
   local prefix.  While RFC 4862 is careful not to define any specific
   length of link-local prefix within fe80::/10, operationally there
   would be a problem unless all hosts on a link use IIDs of the same
   length to configure a link-local address during reboot.  Typically
   today the choice of 64 bits for the link-local IID length is hard-
   coded per interface.  There might be no way to change this except
   conceivably by manual configuration, which will be impossible if the
   host concerned has no local user interface.

5.  Experimental observations

5.1.  Survey of the processing of Neighbor Discovery options with
      prefixes other than /64

   This section provides a survey of the processing of Neighbor
   Discovery options which include prefixes that are different than /64.

   The behavior of nodes was assessed with respect to the following
   options:

   o  PIO-A: Prefix Information Option (PIO) [RFC4861] with the A bit
      set.

   o  PIO-L: Prefix Information Option (PIO) [RFC4861] with the L bit
      set.

   o  PIO-AL: Prefix Information Option (PIO) [RFC4861] with both the A
      and L bits set.

   o  RIO: Route Information Option (RIO) [RFC4191].

   In the tables below, the following notation is used:

   NOT-SUP:
      This option is not supported (i.e., it is ignored no matter the
      prefix length used).

   LOCAL:
      The corresponding prefix is considered "on-link".

   ROUTE
      The corresponding route is added to the IPv6 routing table.

   IGNORE:
      The Option is ignored as an error.

     Table 2: Processing of ND options with prefixes shorter than /64

   The results obtained can be summarized as follows:

   o  the "A" bit in the Prefix Information Options is honored only if
      the prefix length is 64.

   o  the "L bit in the Prefix Information Options is honored for any
      arbitrary prefix length (whether shorter or longer than /64).

   o  nodes that support the Route Information Option, allow such routes
      to be specified with prefixes of any arbitrary length (whether
      shorter or longer than /64)

5.2.  Other Observations

   Participants in the V6OPS working group have indicated that some
   forwarding devices have been shown to work correctly with long prefix
   masks such as /80 or /96.  Indeed, it is to be expected that longest
   prefix match based forwarding will work for any prefix length, and no
   reports of this failing have been noted.  Also, DHCPv6 is in
   widespread use without any dependency on the /64 boundary.
   Reportedly, there are deployments of /120 subnets configured using
   DHCPv6.

   It has been reported that at least one type of switch has a content-
   addressable memory limited to 144 bits.  This means that filters
   cannot be defined based on 128-bit addresses and two 16-bit port
   numbers; the longest prefix that could be used in such a filter is /
   112.

   There have been unconfirmed assertions that some routers have a
   performance drop-off for prefixes longer than /64, due to design
   issues.

   More input with practical observations is welcomed.

6.  Privacy issues

   The length of the interface identifier has implications for privacy
   [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-address-generation-privacy].  In any case in
   which the value of the identifier is intended to be hard to guess,
   whether or not it is cryptographically generated, it is apparent that
   more bits are better.  For example, if there are only 20 bits to be
   guessed, at most just over a million guesses are needed, today well
   within the capacity of a low cost attack mechanism.  It is hard to
   state in general how many bits are enough to protect privacy, since
   this depends on the resources available to the attacker, but it seems
   clear that a privacy solution needs to resist an attack requiring
   billions rather than millions of guesses.  Trillions would be better,
   suggesting that at least 40 bits should be available.  Thus we can
   argue that subnet prefixes longer than say /80 might raise privacy
   concerns by making the IID guessable.

   A prefix long enough to limit the number of addresses comparably to
   an IPv4 subnet, such as /120, would create exactly the same situation
   for privacy as IPv4.  In particular, a host would be forced to pick a
   new IID when roaming to a new network, to avoid collisions.  An
   argument could be made that since this reduces traceability, it is a
   good thing from a privacy point of view.

7.  Implementation and deployment issues

   From an early stage, implementations and deployments of IPv6 assumed
   the /64 subnet size, even though routing was based on variable-length
   subnet masks of any length.  As shown above, this became anchored in
   many specifications (Section 3) and in important aspects of
   implementations commonly used in local area networks (Section 5).  In
   fact, a programmer might be lulled into assuming a comfortable rule
   of thumb that subnet prefixes are always /64 and an IID is always of
   length 64.  Apart from the limited evidence in Section 5.1, we cannot
   tell without code inspections or tests whether existing stacks are
   able to handle a flexible IID length, or whether they would require
   modification to do so.

   The main practical consequence of the existing specifications is that
   deployments in which longer subnet prefixes are used cannot make use
   of SLAAC-configured addresses, and require either statically
   configured addresses or DHCPv6.  To reverse this argument, if it was



Carpenter, et al.        Expires August 10, 2014               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                   Why 64                    February 2014


   considered desirable to allow auto-configured addresses with subnet
   prefixes longer than /64, all of the specifications identified above
   as depending on /64 would have to be modified, with due regard to
   interoperability with unmodified stacks.  In fact
   [I-D.ietf-6man-stable-privacy-addresses] allows for this possibility.
   Then modified stacks would have to be developed and deployed.  It
   might be the case that some stacks contain dependencies on the /64
   boundary which are not directly implied by the specifications, and
   any such hidden dependencies would also need to be found and removed.

   Typical IP Address Management (IPAM) tools treat /64 as the default
   subnet size, but allow users to specify longer subnet prefixes if
   desired.  Clearly, all IPAM tools and network management systems
   would need to be checked in detail.

   Some implementation issues concerning prefix assignment are worth
   mentioning.

   1.  It is sometimes suggested that assigning a prefix such as /48 or
       /56 to every user site (including the smallest) as recommended by
       [RFC6177] is wasteful.  In fact, the currently released unicast
       address space, 2000::/3, contains 35 trillion /48 prefixes
       ((2**45 = 35,184,372,088,832).  With 2000::/3 and 0::/3 currently
       committed, we still have 75% of the address space in reserve.
       Thus there is no objective risk of prefix depletion by assigning
       /48 or /56 prefixes.  This should be considered when evaluating
       the scenario of Section 2.1.

   2.  Some have argued that more prefix bits are needed to allow a
       hierarchical addressing scheme within a campus or corporate
       network.  However, flat routing is widely and successfully used
       within rather large networks, with hundreds of routers and
       thousands of end systems.  Therefore there is no objective need
       for additional prefix bits to support hierarchy and aggregation.

   3.  Some network operators wish to know and audit which nodes are
       active on a network, especially those that are allowed to
       communicate off link or off site.  They may also wish to limit
       the total number of active addresses and sessions that can be
       sourced from a particular host, LAN or site, in order to prevent
       potential resource depletion attacks or other problems spreading
       beyond a certain scope of control.  It has been argued that this
       type of control would be easier if only long network prefixes
       with relatively small numbers of possible hosts per network were
       used, reducing the discovery problem.

   We now list some practical effects of the fixed /64 boundary.

   o  Everything is the same.  Compared to IPv4, there is no more
      calculating (leaf) subnet sizes, no more juggling between subnets,
      fewer errors.

   o  There are always enough addresses in any subnet to add one or more
      devices.  There might be other limits, but addressing will never
      get in the way.

   o  Adding a subnet is easy - just take the next /64.  No estimates,
      calculations, consideration or judgment is needed.

   o  Router configurations are easier to understand.

   o  Documentation is easier to write and easier to read; training is
      easier.

8.  Conclusion

   Summary of pros and cons; risks (write this bit last!)

9.  Security Considerations

   In addition to the privacy issues mentioned in Section 6, and the
   issues mentioned with CGAs and HBAs in Section 4, the length of the
   subnet prefix affects the matter of defence against scanning attacks
   [I-D.ietf-opsec-ipv6-host-scanning].  Assuming the attacker has
   discovered or guessed the prefix length, a longer prefix reduces the
   space that the attacker needs to scan, e.g., to only 256 addresses if
   the prefix is /120.  On the other hand, if the attacker has not
   discovered the prefix length and assumes it to be /64, routers can
   trivially discard attack packets that do not fall within an actual
   subnet.

   However, assume that an attacker finds one valid address A and then
   starts a scanning attack by scanning "outwards" from A, by trying
   A+1, A-1, A+2, A-2, etc.  This attacker will easily find all hosts in
   any subnet with a long prefix, because they will have addresses close
   to A. We therefore conclude that any prefix containing densely packed
   valid addresses is vulnerable to a scanning attack, without the
   attacker needing to guess the prefix length.  Therefore, to preserve
   IPv6's advantage over IPv4 in resisting scanning attacks, it is
   important that subnet prefixes are short enough to allow sparse
   allocation of identifiers within each subnet.  The considerations are
   similar to those for privacy, and we can again argue that prefixes
   longer than say /80 might significantly increase vulnerability.
   Ironically, this argument is exactly converse to the argument for
   longer prefixes to resist an ND cache attack, as described in
   Section 2.2.

   Denial of service attacks related to Neighbor Discovery are discussed
   in [RFC6583].  One of the mitigations suggested by that document is
   "sizing subnets to reflect the number of addresses actually in use",
   but the fact that this greatly simplifies scanning attacks is not
   noted.  For further discussion of scanning attacks, see
   [I-D.ietf-opsec-ipv6-host-scanning].

   Note that, although not known at the time of writing, there might be
   other resource exhaustion attacks available, similar in nature to the
   ND cache attack.  We cannot exclude that such attacks might be
   exacerbated by sparsely populated subnets such as a /64.  It should
   also be noted that this analysis assumes a conventional deployment
   model with a significant number of end-systems located in a single
   LAN broadcast domain.  Other deployment models might lead to
   different conclusions.
