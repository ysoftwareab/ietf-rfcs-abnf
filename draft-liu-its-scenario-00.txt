1.  Scenario of Intelligent Transportation System Mobile Applications

   This document introduces several intelligent transportation system
   mobile applications.  From those applications, we analyze the
   scenario and requirement of intelligent transportation system.

1.1.  Waze

   Waze (https://www.waze.com/) is a community-based traffic and
   navigation application.  The drivers who use waze can share the
   traffic related event to other waze users.  Traffic related event
   includes traffic jams, accidents, road hazards etc.  It uses the idea
   of UGC (User Provided Content) to generate real-time traffic map.
   Waze users can also communicate with each other using the waze
   platform.  For example, a group of friends that have the same
   destination can share their location to coordinate everyone's arrival
   times.

   Waze architecture is shown in figure 1.

                        Figure 1: Waze architecture

   Summary of the Waze architecture

   o  There is a centralized waze server that collect the road and
      traffic information.

   o  Waze application can communicate with each other through
      centralized waze server.

   o  Waze application's communication is based on TCP/IP.

1.2.  iRezQ

   iRezQ is another mobile application in the ITS field.  Its main use
   case is for driving safety.  The iRezQ mobile application running on
   the driver's mobile phone can monitor the vehicle's speed to detect
   whether there is a collision.  When collision is detected, iRezQ
   application can dial the emergency call automatically.  The
   architecture of iRezQ architecture is shown in figure 2.

     Crash

                       Figure 2: iRezQ architecture

   Summary of iRezQ architecture:

   o  The iRezQ mobile application is used to detect whether there is a
      collision occurs.  It uses the sensors in the mobile phone and
      certain algorithm to determine whether there is a crash happening.

   o  If there is a crash detected by iRezQ mobile application, it will
      warn the driver and sent out iRezQ-Warning message to all the
      nearby drivers who are using iRezQ mobile application.  The nearby
      iRezQ users will receive a "WARNING!  ACCIDENT NEARBY" message.
      It will prevent the nearby drivers running into the collision
      again and result in a second crash.

   o  For premium member, iRezQ mobile application will alert the iRezQ
      emergency rescue center where an operator can see the driver's
      position and breaking pattern presented i a graph.  The iRezQ
      rescue center will try to reach the driver if they suspect a true
      accident.

1.3.  Sentinel

   Sentinel is security system used in Dakar rally.  It is a security
   system that alerts the drivers and riders about imminent overtakes or
   accidents.  It beeps and glows to warn the rider that he is going to
   be overtaken.  It alerts the participant who's being overtaken when
   there are 200m between two vehicles.  The architecture of sentinel is
   shown in figure 3.

   Figure 3: Sentinel architecture

   Summary of sentinel architecture:

   o  There is a vehicle to vehicle distance detection/communication in
      sentinel architecture.

1.4.  COYOTE

   Coyote System is a provider of community-based driving assistants.
   Coyote provides real-time information on speed limits, road hazards
   and traffic conditions to the coyote users.  The architecture of
   coyote is shown in figure 4.

                     |  coyote platform |

                       Figure 4: Coyote architecture

   Summary of coyote architecture:

   o  Coyote has similar architecture as Waze.  Coyote users can share
      traffic information to coyote platform and the coyote platform can
      share the traffic information to other coyote users.

2.  Communication Requirement of ITS Application

   This section discusses the communication requirement of ITS
   application.  Section 1 introduces several ITS mobile applications.
   From the analysis, we can conclude that:

   o  All the communication between the ITS mobile application and its
      backend server is based on IP.

Internet-Draft                ITS Scenario                    March 2015


   o  For some of those ITS applications, there is no direct
      communication between the ITS mobile applications but there is
      communication between ITS applications through the backend server.

   o  For some ITS application, for example, Sentinel, there is a
      requirement of direct communication between vehicles.

   IP provides the most flexibility from the developer's perspective.
   There are plenty of developers that are familiar with developing
   application based on TCP/IP.  If there is a direct IP connection
   between vehicles, it will help the developers to develop more
   innovative and useful applications.
