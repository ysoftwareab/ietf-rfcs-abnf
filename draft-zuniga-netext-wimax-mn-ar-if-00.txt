   protocols between the ASN and the CSN to support AAA, policy
   enforcement and mobility management capabilities.  It also
   encompasses the Bearer Plane methods (e.g., tunneling) to transfer
   user data between the ASN and the CSN.  Reference Point R4 consists
   of the set of Control and Bearer Plane protocols originating/
   terminating in various functional entities of an ASN that coordinate
   MS mobility between ASNs and ASN-GWs.  Reference Point R5 consists of
   the set of Control Plane and Bearer Plane protocols for
   internetworking between the CSN operated by the home NSP and that
   operated by a visited NSP.

   In PMIPv6 supported network, in order to provide the IP mobility
   service connectivity to MS that does not have mobility capability,
   LMA in CSN will assign a home prefix or an IPv4 MN-HoA to the MS (if
   not statically allocated from the AAA server).  Depending on the
   network configuration, the home prefix(es) could be assigned by
   either V-LMA (if VCSN exists) or H-LMA.  Authentication,
   authorization and accounting information as well as policy control
   are handled by the home NSP over R3 and/or R5 reference points.

   In the remainder of this document we assume PMIPv6 is the selected
   mobility management protocol.


3.  Differences between PMIP in WiMAX and IETF specifications

   The WiMAX network architecture is specified in [WMF-T32-002-R010v04
   Part 1].  The PMIPv6 protocol support in WiMAX is specified in [WiMAX
   Forum Network Working Group Proxy MIPv6 support Stage 2].  The main
   differences between the PMIPv6 protocol specified in [RFC5213] and
   the PMIPv6 protocol specified by WiMAX Forum are listed here and
   described in more details in the following sub-sections.  These
   differences are mainly: 1) the introduction of new parameters used to
   indicate the IP service capability of the ASN and VCSN, 2) the
   introduction of the Authenticator/NAS function and 3) the in-band
   protocol security applied by the MAG/LMA to the PBU/PBA.

3.1.  New parameters introduced to indicate IP service capability

   The new parameters named ASN IP Service Capabilities and VCSN IP
   Service Capabilities are used to indicate the IP service capability
   of the ASN and VCSN and are introduced in the WiMAX network.

   It should be noted that these parameters are conveyed from ASN (VCSN)
   to (H)CSN through AAA request message.  Once the MS is successfully
   authenticated by the HAAA and HCSN has authorized one or more IP
   Services, the Authorized IP Services and Authorized Anchor Location
   attributes are passed to ASN through AAA Response message.

Internet-Draft            PMIP support in WiMAX            November 2009


   These parameters are not specified in the PMIP specifications
   [RFC5213]

3.2.  Authenticator/NAS function introduced

   The Authenticator/NAS negotiates the PMIPv6 security mode with the
   HAAA and makes that information available to the MAG.  If the
   negotiated security mode is in-band, then the Authenticator/NAS
   facilitates authentication and authorization functions with the aim
   to acquire, store and distribute keys and related security
   information required for PMIPv6 operation.  Authenticator interworks
   with MAG in the process of establishing the LMA trust relationships
   and appropriately securing mobility signaling.

   The Authenticator/NAS functionally is specific to the WiMAX
   specifications.  What is specified in [RFC4285] is only concerning
   the authentication and AAA server: "The network entities in the Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 domain, while serving a mobile node, will have access to
   the mobile node's policy profile and these entities can query this
   information using RADIUS [RFC2865] or DIAMETER [RFC3588] protocols".

3.3.  In-band protocol security applied between MAG/LMA

   There are two mandatory-to-implement and optional-to-use security
   modes for PMIP6: One using [RFC4285] (in-band security), and the
   other not using any PMIP6-specific security but relying on the R3/R5
   control plane security (lower-layer security).  NSP and NAP decide
   which mode to operate based on their local policy and the dynamic
   negotiation during the network access authentication of the MS.  MAG
   learns the negotiated mode from the authenticator in order to
   generate the PBU and process the PBA accordingly.

   Proxy MIPv6 [RFC5213] specifies IPsec as a mandatory-to-implement
   security mechanism.  It also specifies that the use of IPsec for
   protecting a mobile node's data traffic is optional.  Additionally,
   it specifies that other documents may specify alternative for
   securing Proxy Mobile IPv6 signaling messages.  In WiMAX networks,
   the PMIPv6 signaling messages are secured using the security mode
   defined in [RFC4285] (use of AE in the PBU/PBA).


4.  PMIPv6 support - CSN anchored mobility management

   As stated before we focus here on the use of PMIPv6.  We summarize in
   the following sections the attachment procedures, PMIPv6 connection
   setup, CSN-anchored mobility handover and detachment procedures
   focusing on the PMIPv6 usage and MAG, Authenticator, LMA functions.

Internet-Draft            PMIP support in WiMAX            November 2009


4.1.  Network attachment

   CSN anchored mobility management based on PMIPv6 is transparent to
   the MS.  At the time of the network entry, MS undergoes the regular
   attachment procedures without directly participating in mobility
   signaling; selects the network, performs the network entry and
   proceeds by configuring the IP address.  For a given MS, the network
   determines whether to use PMIPv6 or not.

4.1.1.  Network Service Capability Negotiation

   Simple IP, CMIP and PMIP services for IPv4 as well as IPv6 may be
   simultaneously provided by a network.  Such network configuration
   provides coexistence of Simple IP service and MIP service support on
   a per user basis.  Whether the Simple IP service or PMIP or CMIP
   service is invoked by the network for a given user will depend on the
   user profile, network capabilities negotiation between ASN, VCSN and
   HCSN along with the operator policy.

4.1.1.1.  Selection Scheme

   The Network Service Capability Negotiation and Selection scheme
   expands the network access authentication and authorization process
   adding capability to negotiate the appropriate IP service among ASN,
   VCSN (when exists) and HCSN.  Two new RADIUS attributes named ASN IP
   Service Capability and V-CSN IP Service Capabilities have been
   defined to indicate IP service capabilities of ASN and VCSN,
   respectively.

   These parameters are conveyed from ASN (VCSN) to (H)CSN through AAA
   request message.  Once the MS is successfully authenticated by the
   HAAA and HCSN has authorized one or more IP Services, the Authorized
   IP Services and Authorized Anchor Location attributes are passed to
   ASN through AAA Response message.

   Depending on the outcome of this capability negotiation, ASN offers
   only one of authorized Simple IP, PMIP or CMIP services to the
   mobile.  When multiple IP services are authorized it is the ASN
   network that makes the final decision of whether or not to allow MS
   request and assign the appropriate IP service support for this MS.

4.1.1.2.  Selection Flow

   During MS authentication phase, the AAA Request message is sent by
   the ASN to the H-AAA of the MS (may be sent via the AAA Proxy at the
   VCSN).  In particular, ASN includes the ASN IP Service Capabilities
   attribute in the AAA Request to provide current ASN IP service
   capability information of this ASN to the HAAA.



Zuniga, et al.            Expires May 10, 2010                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft            PMIP support in WiMAX            November 2009


   After receiving AAA Request message, the VCSN adds VCSN IP Service
   Capabilities attribute to this message and forward the message to
   HAAA Server at the HCSN.

   Once the HAAA Server successfully authenticates and authorizes the MS
   services, the HAAA returns the AAA Response message to the NAS in ASN
   via the AAA Proxy at the VCSN.  Together with other MS subscriber and
   IP configuration parameters, the Authorized IP Services (and Visited
   Authorized IP Services if VCSN anchoring is permitted) attribute are
   also included in the AAA Response message.

   The AAA Proxy in VCSN relays this AAA Response message to ASN.  The
   ASN extracts out the Authorized IP Services and Visited Authorized IP
   Services information, stores them locally and makes it available to
   use by the appropriate IP service function entities within ASN.
   Depending on the outcome of the capability negotiation, the ASN
   selects among the authorized services and offers a single IP service
   to the MS.

4.1.2.  IP address configuration

   WiMAX network supports both stateless and stateful IPv6 address
   autoconfiguration methods within the PMIPv6 scope.  Depending on the
   configuration and preferences, MS can try to configure an IPv4
   address by DHCPv4, one or more IPv6 addresses by DHCPv6 or stateless
   address autoconfiguration.

   If for any reason the network needs to enforce a specific
   configuration method it must set the particular address configuration
   flags in the RA messages (ManagedFlag and OtherConfigFlag) to do so.

   The HNP for the PMIPv6 MN-HoA may be allocated from two sources, the
   LMA or the AAA server.

   - Prefix/HoA can be bootstrapped from the dedicated AAA server during
   the network authentication process.

   - PMIPv6 LMA assigns the unique/64 IPv6 prefix in response to the PBU
   message from the AR/MAG (ASN) with Home Prefix option set to
   ALL_ZERO, when HNP has not been obtained through network
   authentication.

4.2.  PMIPv6 connection setup

   The network authentication enables the ASN/NAS to negotiate and
   boostrap the necessary PMIPv6 mobility parameters and network
   configuration, including the assigned IP address or IPv6 prefix,
   security related settings, authorized address configuration mode(s),



Zuniga, et al.            Expires May 10, 2010                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft            PMIP support in WiMAX            November 2009


   etc.

   The PMIPv6 connection setup takes place after the initial network
   entry and access authentication is completed.  The prerequisite for
   the procedure is the network decision to assign the network-based
   PMIPv6 service for MS IP session.  The mobility binding registration
   from the AR/MAG can occur at any moment following the access
   authentication response that brought the required IP capabilities and
   services authorization from the H/VCSN to the ASN where MS is
   attaching.

   The connection setup procedures are differentiated by the address
   configuration process the MS undergoes.  For an IPv6 MS the WiMAX
   network should provide both stateful and stateless address
   (auto)configuration modes with per-MS unique prefix assignment, while
   for IPv4 MS, the DHCPv4 support is needed to distribute the IPv4 MN-
   HoA to the MS.

   The MS is not involved in PMIPv6 mobility procedures and only
   required to perform the common address acquisition and configuration
   procedure to obtain IP mobility management via PMIPv6.

4.3.  PMIPv6 CSN-anchored mobility handover

   PMIPv6 mobility handover comes as a result of the A-DPF handover and
   R3 path relocation to the new serving ASN.  There are no specific
   requirements towards the MS for the case of PMIPv6 handover.  The new
   serving ASN(b) SHOULD assure the appropriate link configuration and
   the same address of the first-hop AR/MAG get consistently advertised
   to the MS after the HO, to hide the actual change of the attaching
   link.

   If not performed during the Idle Mode, the process is preceded by
   regular ASN-MM procedures where the PMIPv6 MAG remains anchored at
   the previous serving ASN-GW/ASN(a) until the Push/Pull A-DPF HO is
   triggered.  In course of the process the new ASN-GW/ASN(b) obtains
   all mobility and security wise session information from the serving
   ASN(a) and Anchor Authenticator, and is able to register the MS new
   location at the LMA.  Successful PMIPv6 registration from the new MAG
   (new Proxy CoA) results with a refresh to binding cache at the LMA,
   extension to MS PMIPv6 session and an update to MS forwarding tunnel
   now redirected towards the new serving MAG at the ASN(b).

   In case of idle mode, when the MS has established the data path on
   the new serving ASN(b), triggered by one of the HO events, the
   serving ASN(b) may initiate PMIPv6 HO by sending the
   Anchor_DPF_HO_Trigger message to the anchor ASN(a) for PULL handover
   mode.  The anchor ASN(a) either responds or self-initiates the

   handover (PUSH mode) by sending the Anchor_DPF_HO_Req to the serving
   ASN(b).  The message contains the relevant information associated
   with the specific PMIPv6 session; allocated HNP or IPv4 HoA, LMA IP
   address, protocol configuration details such as DHCP and security
   mode (if applicable), etc.  The target ASN(b) sends an
   Anchor_DPF_Relocate_Req message to the anchor Authenticator
   requesting a PMIP6 HO.  If the ongoing PMIPv6 session requires in-
   band protocol security, the target ASN(b) requests the keying
   information from the anchor Authenticator needed to protect the
   forthcoming PMIPv6 signaling exchange with the LMA.

   In case that target AR/MAG in ASN(b) receives Anchor_DPF_
   Relocate_Rsp message from the anchor Authenticator, it triggers PBU/
   PBA procedure to register MS new location and create the PMIPv6
   tunnel between itself and the LMA. the target ASN(b) updates the
   anchor Authenticator with new AR/MAG location by sending the
   Anchor_DPF_Relocate_Ack message with success code.  The target ASN(b)
   also informs the ASN(a) of the PBU registration result by sending an
   Anchor_DPF_HO_Rsp with an appropriate result code.

   Target AR/MAG performs the PBU registration procedure following the
   guidelines specified in [RFC5213] .  The PBU MUST contain the MN ID,
   HNP or IPv6 HoA options, the Access Technology Type (set to value
   WIMAX), the Handoff Indicator option (set to value of 3) as well as
   the Link-local Address option (set to value ALL_ZERO, requesting the
   LMA to provide current in-use AR downlink address).

   The LMA updates the MS binding cache entry with the new location
   information storing the new Proxy-CoA address.  Upon successfully
   updating the MS BCE, the LMA establishes PMIPv6 tunnel towards the
   new AR/MAG together and installs the corresponding forwarding rules,
   and simultaneously tears down the tunnel towards the previous AR/MAG
   (old Proxy-CoA).  If the AAA indicates in-band protocol security is
   needed for the ongoing PMIPv6 session (i.e., use of AE in PBA/PBU),
   the LMA requires and derives the necessary security parameters as to
   protect the PBA before it is sent to the target AR/MAG.

   Upon receiving PBA from the LMA indicating registration success, the
   new AR/MAG in ASN(b) updates its local MS context and mobility
   binding with the information obtained, creates PMIPv6 transport
   tunnel towards the LMA and install the needed forwarding rules.

4.4.  PMIPv6 session termination

   MS self-initiates PMIPv6 session termination when detaching from the
   network with graceful network exit, or simply performing the IP/DHCP
   release procedure for its IP session.  The designated network
   entities may also initiate the IP session termination if discovering

   the MS has detached/lost connectivity, prohibited from continuing the
   service or for some other operative or administrative reason.  The
   ASN-GW/A-DPF, LMA or the AAA server induce the path deregistration by
   issuing a corresponding trigger message towards the serving ASN-GW/
   ASN.  Session termination SHALL follow the common NWG procedures and
   signaling exchange to achieve R4/R6 (R6 is the interface between the
   BS and MAG in the ASN) path release, MS state change and accounting
   stop.  If applicable, the network-initiated session termination
   includes PMIPv6 De-registration at the LMA as well as IP/DHCP release
   on the MS side.


5.  Security Considerations

   For constructing the PBU and processing PBA response from the LMA,
   the AR/MAG follows requirements from [RFC5213] on MS attachment and
   initial binding registration, and receiving the PBA section, with one
   key difference.  Inline with PMIPv6 service authorization results
   from the Access-Accept, the AR/MAG must apply in-band protocol
   security to the PBU sent to the LMA.  When lower-layer transport
   security is requested by the HCSN, AR/MAG abandons explicit
   protection of PMIPv6 control plane.  In any case, trust relationship
   MUST be established between LMA and its corresponding MAGs.

   When in-band security is enabled (use of AE in the PBU/PBA), the LMA
   retrieves all necessary keying information from the AAA.  Then the
   PBU includes a valid MAG-LMA derivation in the MN-HA mobility message
   authentication option [RFC4285].

   The received PBU that entails signaling protection in form of valid
   authentication option MUST be replied a PBA using the same protection
   mechanism.  The PBUs received without embedded signaling protection
   is processed and acknowledged only if the source MAG is considered
   trusted and use of AE options is not enforced for that PMIPv6 peer.

   In case MS handovers from one ASN where R3 security is present to
   another ASN where it is not present and the target ASN wants to
   initiate change of PMIPv6 security mode, a re-authentication has to
   take place in order to change the negotiated security mechanism upon
   the handover.  This change is feasible only to the LMA that supports
   the change of the security mechanism from in-band to lower-layer, or
   vice-versa, for the same MS upon an R3 handover.

   When the negotiated mechanism is the lower-layer security, then the
   MAG/LMA does not include Mobility Message Authentication Option
   [RFC4285] in the PBU/PBAs, and MAG/LMA does not drop any incoming
   PBU/PBA which carries that option.
