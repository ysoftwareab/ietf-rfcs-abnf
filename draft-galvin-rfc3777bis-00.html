  confirmation, and recall of some or all of the individuals who
  serve terms of membership on the bodies that support its
  operation.  As of the publication of this document the list of
  bodies includes the IESG, IAB, and the IAOC.  This document is a
  self-consistent, organized compilation of the process as it was
  known at the time of publication.

Introduction</h3>

<p><sup><small>4</small></sup>This document is a revision of and supercedes
<a class='info' href='#RFC3777'>RFC3777.<span> (</span><span class='info'>Galvin, J., &ldquo;IAB and IESG Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3777] It is a complete
specification of how designated members are selected, confirmed, and
recalled as of the date of its approval.
</p>
<p><sup><small>5</small></sup>This specification applies to all members of the IESG and
  IAB.
</p>
<p><sup><small>6</small></sup><a class='info' href='#RFC4071'>RFC4071<span> (</span><span class='info'>Austein, R. and B. Wijnen, &ldquo;Structure of the IETF   Administrative Support Activity (IASA),&rdquo; April&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4071], "Structure of the IETF
  Administrative Support Activity (IASA)", defines the membership
  and selection rules for the IAOC.  There are two members of the
  IAOC that are subject to the selection and confirmation process
  specified in this document.  However, all members of the IAOC are
  subject to the recall process specified in this document.
</p>
<p><sup><small>7</small></sup>The following three assumptions are true of this specification.

</p>
<ol class="text">
<li><sup><small>8</small></sup>The Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) and Internet Research
  Steering Group (IRSG) are not a part of the process described
  here.
</li>
<li><sup><small>9</small></sup>The organization (and re-organization) of the IESG is not a part
  of the process described here.
</li>
<li><sup><small>10</small></sup>The organization (and re-organization) of the IAOC is not a part
  of the process described here.
</li>
</ol><p>


</p>
<p><sup><small>11</small></sup>The time frames specified here use IETF meetings as a frame of
reference.  The time frames assume that the IETF meets three times per
calendar year with approximately equal amounts of time between them.
The meetings are referred to as the First IETF, Second IETF, or Third
IETF as needed.
</p>
<p><sup><small>12</small></sup>The next section lists the words and phrases commonly used throughout
this document with their intended meaning.
</p>
<p><sup><small>13</small></sup>The majority of this document is divided into four major topics as
follows.

</p>

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
General</h3>

<p><sup><small>26</small></sup>The following set of rules apply to the process as a whole.  If
necessary, a paragraph discussing the interpretation of each rule is
included.

</p>
<ol class="text">
<li><sup><small>27</small></sup>The completion of the annual process is due within 7 months.

<br />
<br />
The completion of the annual process is due one
month prior to the Friday of the week before the First IETF.  It is
expected to begin at least 8 months prior to the Friday of the week
before the First IETF.

<br />
<br />
The process officially begins with the
announcement of the Chair of the committee.  The process officially ends
when all confirmed candidates have been announced.

<br />
<br />
The annual process is comprised of three major
components as follows.


<ol class="text">
<li><sup><small>28</small></sup>The selection and organization of the nominating committee
members.
</li>
<li><sup><small>29</small></sup>The selection of candidates by the nominating committee.
</li>
<li><sup><small>30</small></sup>The confirmation of the candidates.
</li>
</ol>

<br />
<br />
There is an additional month set aside between
when the annual process is expected to end and the term of the new
candidates is to begin.  This time may be used during unusual
circumstances to extend the time allocated for any of the components
listed above.


</li>
<li><sup><small>31</small></sup>The principal functions of the nominating committee are to review
each open position under consideration, and to either nominate its
incumbent or a superior candidate.

<br />
<br />
 Although there is no term limit for serving
in any position, the nominating committee may use length of service
as one of its criteria for evaluating an incumbent.

<br />
<br />
 The nominating committee does not select the
open positions to be reviewed; it is instructed as to which positions to
review.

<br />
<br />
 The nominating committee will be given the
title of the positions to be reviewed and a brief summary of the desired
expertise of the candidate that is nominated to fill each position.

<br />
<br />
 Incumbents must notify the nominating committee
if they wish to be nominated.

<br />
<br />
 The nominating committee does not confirm its
candidates; it presents its candidates to the appropriate confirming
body as indicated below.

<br />
<br />
 A superior candidate is one who the nominating
committee believes would contribute in such a way as to improve or
enhance the body to which he or she is nominated.


</li>
<li><sup><small>32</small></sup>One-half of each of the then current positions is selected to be
reviewed each year.

<br />
<br />
 The intent of this rule to ensure the
review of approximately one-half of the sitting members of the
bodies to which this document applies.  It is recognized that
circumstances may exist that will require the nominating committee
to review more or less than one-half of the current positions, e.g.,
if one of the bodies has re-organized prior to this process and
created new positions, if there are an odd number of current
positions, or if a member unexpectedly resigns.


</li>
<li><sup><small>33</small></sup>Confirmed candidates are expected to serve at least a 2 year term.

<br />
<br />
 The intent of this rule is to ensure that
members of the bodies serve the number of years that best
facilitates the review of one-half of the members each year.

<br />
<br />
 The term of a confirmed candidate selected
according to the mid-term vacancy rules may be less than 2 years, as
stated elsewhere in this document.

<br />
<br />
 It is consistent with this rule for the
nominating committee to choose one or more of the currently open
positions to which it may assign a term of not more than 3 years in
order to ensure the ideal application of this rule in the future.

<br />
<br />
 It is consistent with this rule for the
nominating committee to choose one or more of the currently open
positions that share responsibilities with other positions (both those
being reviewed and those sitting) to which it may assign a term of not
more than 3 years to ensure that all such members will not be reviewed
at the same time.

<br />
<br />
 All sitting member terms end during the First
IETF meeting corresponding to the end of the term for which they were
confirmed.  All confirmed candidate terms begin during the First IETF
meeting corresponding to the beginning of the term for which they were
confirmed.

<br />
<br />
 For confirmed candidates of the IESG the terms
begin no later than when the currently sitting members' terms end on the
last day of the meeting.  A term may begin or end no sooner than the
first day of the meeting and no later than the last day of the meeting
as determined by the mutual agreement of the currently sitting member
and the confirmed candidate.  A confirmed candidate's term may overlap
the sitting member's term during the meeting as determined by their
mutual agreement.

<br />
<br />
 For confirmed candidates of other bodies
the terms overlap with the terms of the sitting members for the
entire week of the meeting.

<br />
<br />
 For candidates confirmed under the mid-term
vacancy rules, the term begins as soon as possible after the
confirmation.


</li>
<li><sup><small>34</small></sup>Mid-term vacancies are filled by the same rules as documented here
with four qualifications.

<br />
<br />
First, when there is only one official
nominating committee, the body with the mid-term vacancy relegates the
responsibility to fill the vacancy to it.  If the mid-term vacancy
occurs during the period of time that the term of the prior year's
nominating committee overlaps with the term of the current year's
nominating committee, the body with the mid-term vacancy must relegate
the responsibility to fill the vacancy to the prior year's nominating
committee.

<br />
<br />
Second, if it is the case that the nominating
committee is reconvening to fill the mid-term vacancy, then the
completion of the candidate selection and confirmation process is due
within 6 weeks, with all other time periods otherwise unspecified
prorated accordingly.

<br />
<br />
Third, the confirming body has two weeks from
the day it is notified of a candidate to reject the candidate, otherwise
the candidate is assumed to have been confirmed.

<br />
<br />
Fourth, the term of the confirmed candidate will
be either:


<ol class="text">
<li><sup><small>35</small></sup>the remainder of the term of the open position if that remainder is
not less than one year.
</li>
<li><sup><small>36</small></sup>the remainder of the term of the open position plus the next 2 year
term if that remainder is less than one year.
</li>
</ol>

<br />
<br />
In both cases a year is the period of time from
a First IETF meeting to the next First IETF meeting.


</li>
<li><sup><small>37</small></sup>All deliberations and supporting information that relates to specific
nominees, candidates, and confirmed candidates are confidential.

<br />
<br />
 The nominating committee and confirming body
members will be exposed to confidential information as a result of their
deliberations, their interactions with those they consult, and from
those who provide requested supporting information.  All members and all
other participants are expected to handle this information in a manner
consistent with its sensitivity.

<br />
<br />
 It is consistent with this rule for current
nominating committee members who have served on prior nominating
committees to advise the current committee on deliberations and results
of the prior committee, as necessary and appropriate.


</li>
<li><sup><small>38</small></sup>Unless otherwise specified, the advice and consent model is used
throughout the process.  This model is characterized as follows.


<ol class="text">
<li><sup><small>39</small></sup>The IETF Executive Director informs the nominating committee of
the open positions to be reviewed.

<br />
<br />
The respective bodies with the open
positions are responsible for providing a summary of the expertise
desired of the candidates selected for their respective open
positions to the Executive Director.  The summaries are provided to
the nominating committee for its consideration.


</li>
<li><sup><small>40</small></sup>The nominating committee selects candidates based on its
understanding of the IETF community's consensus of the qualifications
required and advises each confirming body of its respective
candidates.
</li>
<li><sup><small>41</small></sup>The confirming bodies review their respective candidates, they may at
their discretion communicate with the nominating committee, and then
consent to some, all, or none of the candidates.

<br />
<br />
The sitting IAB members review the IESG
candidates.

<br />
<br />
The Internet Society Board of Trustees reviews
the IAB candidates.

<br />
<br />
The sitting IESG members review the IAOC
candidates.

<br />
<br />
The confirming bodies conduct their review using
all information and any means acceptable to them, including but not
limited to the supporting information provided by the nominating
committee, information known personally to members of the confirming
bodies and shared within the confirming body, the results of
interactions within the confirming bodies, and the confirming bodies
interpretation of what is in the best interests of the IETF community.

<br />
<br />
 If all of the candidates are confirmed, the job
of the nominating committee with respect to those open positions is
complete.

<br />
<br />
 If some or none of the candidates submitted to
a confirming body are confirmed, the confirming body should communicate
with the nominating committee both to explain the reason why all the
candidates were not confirmed and to understand the nominating
committee's rationale for its candidates.

<br />
<br />
 The confirming body may reject individual
candidates, in which case the nominating committee must select alternate
candidates for the rejected candidates.

<br />
<br />
 Any additional time required by the nominating
committee should not exceed its maximum time allotment.


</li>
<li><sup><small>42</small></sup>A confirming body decides whether it confirms each candidate using a
confirmation decision rule chosen by the confirming body.

<br />
<br />
If a confirming body has no specific
confirmation decision rule, then confirming a given candidate should
require at least one-half of the confirming body's sitting members to
agree to that confirmation.

<br />
<br />
The decision may be made by conducting a formal
vote, by asserting consensus based on informal exchanges (e.g. email),
or by any other mechanism that is used to conduct the normal business of
the confirming body.

<br />
<br />
Regardless of which decision rule the confirming
body uses, any candidate that is not confirmed under that rule is
considered to be rejected.

<br />
<br />
The confirming body must make its decision
within a reasonable time frame.  The results from the confirming body
must be reported promptly to the nominating committee.


</li>
</ol>


</li>
<li><sup><small>43</small></sup>The following rules apply to candidates who are currently sitting
members of a body with an open position, and who are not sitting in
an open position being filled by the nominating committe.

<br />
<br />
The confirmation of a candidate to an open
position does not automatically create a vacancy in the body
currently occupied by the candidate.  The mid-term vacancy can not
exist until, first, the candidate formally resigns from the current
position and, second, the body with the vacancy formally decides for
itself that it wants the nominating committee to fill the mid-term
vacancy according to the rules for a mid-term vacancy documented
elsewhere in this document.

<br />
<br />
The resignation should be effective as of
when the term of the new position begins.  The resignation may
remain confidential to the body and the nominating committee until
the confirmed candidate is announced for the new position.  The
process, according to rules documented elsewhere in this document,
of filling the seat vacated by the confirmed candidate may begin as
soon as the vacancy is publicly announced.

<br />
<br />
Filling a mid-term vacancy is a separate and
independent action from the customary action of filling open positions.
In particular, a nominating committee must complete its job with respect
to filling the open positions and then separately proceed with the task
of filling the mid-term vacancy according to the rules for a mid-term
vacancy documented elsewhere in this document.

<br />
<br />
However, the following exception is permitted in
the case where the candidate for an open position is currently a sitting
member of the IAB.  It is consistent with these rules for the
announcement of a resignation of a sitting member of the IAB and of the
confirmed candidate for the mid-term vacancy created by that sitting
member on the IAB to all occur at the same time as long as the actual
sequence of events that occurred did so in the following order.


<ul class="text">
<li><sup><small>44</small></sup>The nominating committee completes the advice and consent process for
the open position being filled by the candidate currently sitting on the
IAB.
</li>
<li><sup><small>45</small></sup>The newly confirmed candidate resigns from their current position on
the IAB.
</li>
<li><sup><small>46</small></sup>The IAB with the new mid-term vacancy requests that the nominating
committee fill the position.
</li>
<li><sup><small>47</small></sup>The Executive Director of the IETF informs the nominating committee
of the mid-term vacancy.
</li>
<li><sup><small>48</small></sup>The nominating committee acts on the request to fill the mid-term
vacancy.
</li>
</ul>


</li>
<li><sup><small>49</small></sup>All announcements must be made using at least the mechanism used by
the IETF Secretariat for its announcements, including a notice on the
IETF web site.

<br />
<br />
 As of the publication of this document, the
current mechanism is an email message to both the "ietf" and the
"ietf-announce" mailing lists.

Nominating Committee Selection</h3>

<p><sup><small>50</small></sup>The following set of rules apply to the creation of the nominating
committee and the selection of its members.


</p>
<ol class="text">
<li><sup><small>51</small></sup>The completion of the process of selecting and organizing the members
of the nominating committee is due within 3 months.

<br />
<br />
The completion of the selection and organization
process is due at least one month prior to the Third IETF.  This ensures
the nominating committee is fully operational and available for
interviews and consultation during the Third IETF.


</li>
<li><sup><small>52</small></sup>The term of a nominating committee is expected to be 15 months.

<br />
<br />
It is the intent of this rule that the end of a
nominating committee's term overlap by approximately three months the
beginning of the term of the next nominating committee.

<br />
<br />
The term of a nominating committee begins when
its members are officially announced.  The term ends at the Third IETF
(not three meetings), i.e., the IETF meeting after the next nominating
committee's term begins.

<br />
<br />
A term is expected to begin at least two months
prior to the Third IETF to ensure the nominating committee has at least
one month to get organized before preparing for the Third IETF.

<br />
<br />
A nominating committee is expected to complete
any work-in-progress before it is dissolved at the end of its term.

<br />
<br />
During the period of time that the terms of the
nominating committees overlap, all mid-term vacancies are to be
relegated to the prior year's nominating committee.  The prior year's
nominating committee has no other responsibilities during the overlap
period.  At all times other than the overlap period there is exactly one
official nominating committee and it is responsible for all mid-term
vacancies.

<br />
<br />
When the prior year's nominating committee is
filling a mid-term vacancy during the period of time that the terms
overlap, the nominating committees operate independently.  However, some
coordination is needed between them.  Since the prior year's Chair is a
non-voting advisor to the current nominating committee the coordination
is expected to be straightforward.


</li>
<li><sup><small>53</small></sup>The nominating committee comprises at least a Chair, 10 voting
volunteers, 3 liaisons, and an advisor.

<br />
<br />
Any committee member may propose the addition of
an advisor to participate in some or all of the deliberations of the
committee.  The addition must be approved by the committee according to
its established voting mechanism.  Advisors participate as individuals.

<br />
<br />
Any committee member may propose the addition of
a liaison from other unrepresented organizations to participate in some
or all of the deliberations of the committee.  The addition must be
approved by the committee according to its established voting mechanism.
Liaisons participate as representatives of their respective
organizations.

<br />
<br />
The Chair is selected according to rules stated
elsewhere in this document.

<br />
<br />
The 10 voting volunteers are selected according
to rules stated elsewhere in this document.

<br />
<br />
The IESG, IAB, and IAOC liaisons are
selected according to rules stated elsewhere in this document.

<br />
<br />
The Internet Society Board of Trustees may
appoint a liaison to the nominating committee at its own discretion.

<br />
<br />
The Chair of last year's nominating committee
serves as an advisor according to rules stated elsewhere in this
document.

<br />
<br />
None of the Chair, liaisons, or advisors vote on
the selection of candidates.  They do vote on all other issues before
the committee unless otherwise specified in this document.


</li>
<li><sup><small>54</small></sup>The Chair of the nominating committee is responsible for ensuring the
nominating committee completes its assigned duties in a timely fashion
and performs in the best interests of the IETF community.

<br />
<br />
The Chair must be thoroughly familiar with the
rules and guidance indicated throughout this document.  The Chair must
ensure the nominating committee completes its assigned duties in a
manner that is consistent with this document.

<br />
<br />
The Chair must attest by proclamation at a
plenary session of the First IETF that the results of the committee
represent its best effort and the best interests of the IETF community.

<br />
<br />
The Chair does not vote on the selection of
candidates.


</li>
<li><sup><small>55</small></sup>The Internet Society President appoints the Chair, who must meet the
same requirements for membership in the nominating committee as a voting
volunteer.

<br />
<br />
The nominating committee Chair must agree to
invest the time necessary to ensure that the nominating committee
completes its assigned duties and to perform in the best interests of
the IETF community in that role.

<br />
<br />
The appointment is due no later than the Second
IETF meeting to ensure it can be announced during a plenary session at
that meeting.  The completion of the appointment is necessary to ensure
the annual process can complete at the time specified elsewhere in this
document.


</li>
<li><sup><small>56</small></sup>A Chair, in consultation with the Internet Society President, may
appoint a temporary substitute for the Chair position.

<br />
<br />
There are a variety of ordinary circumstances
that may arise from time to time that could result in a Chair being
unavailable to oversee the activities of the committee.  The Chair, in
consultation with the Internet Society President, may appoint a
substitute from a pool comprised of the liaisons currently serving on
the committee and the prior year's Chair or designee.

<br />
<br />
Any such appointment must be temporary and does
not absolve the Chair of any or all responsibility for ensuring the
nominating committee completes its assigned duties in a timely fashion.


</li>
<li><sup><small>57</small></sup>Liaisons are responsible for ensuring the nominating committee in
general and the Chair in particular execute their assigned duties in the
best interests of the IETF community.

<br />
<br />
Liaisons are expected to represent the views of
their respective organizations during the deliberations of the
committee.  They should provide information as requested or when they
believe it would be helpful to the committee.

<br />
<br />
Liaisons from the IESG, IAB, and IAOC are
expected to provide information to the nominating committee
regarding the operation, responsibility, and composition of their
respective bodies.

<br />
<br />
Liaisons are expected to convey questions from
the committee to their respective organizations and responses to those
questions to the committee, as requested by the committee.

<br />
<br />
Liaisons from the IESG, IAB, IAOC, and
Internet Society Board of Trustees (if one was appointed) are
expected to review the operation and executing process of the
nominating committee and to report any concerns or issues to the
Chair of the nominating committee immediately.  If they can not
resolve the issue between themselves, liaisons must report it
according to the dispute resolution process stated elsewhere in this
document.

<br />
<br />
Liaisons from confirming bodies are expected to
assist the committee in preparing the testimony it is required to
provide with its candidates.

<br />
<br />
Liaisons may have other nominating committee
responsibilities as required by their respective organizations or
requested by the nominating committee, except that such responsibilities
may not conflict with any other provisions of this document.

<br />
<br />
Liaisons do not vote on the selection of
candidates.


</li>
<li><sup><small>58</small></sup>The sitting IAOC, IAB, and IESG members each appoint a liaison
from their current membership, someone who is not sitting in an open
position, to serve on the nominating committee.


</li>
<li><sup><small>59</small></sup>An advisor is responsible for such duties as specified by the
invitation that resulted in the appointment.

<br />
<br />
Advisors do not vote on the selection of
candidates.


</li>
<li><sup><small>60</small></sup>The Chair of the prior year's nominating committee serves as an
advisor to the current committee.

<br />
<br />
The prior year's Chair is expected to review the
actions and activities of the current Chair and to report any concerns
or issues to the nominating committee Chair immediately.  If they can
not resolve the issue between themselves, the prior year's Chair must
report it according to the dispute resolution process stated elsewhere
in this document.

<br />
<br />
The prior year's Chair may select a designee
from a pool composed of the voting volunteers of the prior year's
committee and all prior Chairs if the Chair is unavailable.  If the
prior year's Chair is unavailable or is unable or unwilling to make such
a designation in a timely fashion, the Chair of the current year's
committee may select a designee in consultation with the Internet
Society President.

<br />
<br />
Selecting a prior year's committee member as the
designee permits the experience of the prior year's deliberations to be
readily available to the current committee.  Selecting an earlier prior
year Chair as the designee permits the experience of being a Chair as
well as that Chair's committee deliberations to be readily available to
the current committee.

<br />
<br />
All references to "prior year's Chair" in this
document refer to the person serving in that role, whether it is the
actual prior year's Chair or a designee.


</li>
<li><sup><small>61</small></sup>Voting volunteers are responsible for completing the tasks of the
nominating committee in a timely fashion.

<br />
<br />
Each voting volunteer is expected to participate
in all activities of the nominating committee with a level of effort
approximately equal to all other voting volunteers.  Specific tasks to
be completed are established and managed by the Chair according to rules
stated elsewhere in this document.


</li>
<li><sup><small>62</small></sup>The Chair must establish and announce milestones for the selection of
the nominating committee members.

<br />
<br />
There is a defined time period during which the
selection process is due to be completed.  The Chair must establish a
set of milestones which, if met in a timely fashion, will result in the
completion of the process on time.


</li>
<li><sup><small>63</small></sup>The Chair obtains the list of open positions to be reviewed and
announces it along with a solicitation for names of volunteers from
the IETF community willing to serve on the nominating committee.

<br />
<br />
The solicitation must permit the community at
least 30 days during which they may choose to volunteer to be selected
for the nominating committee.

<br />
<br />
The list of open positions is published with
the solicitation to facilitate community members choosing between
volunteering for an open position and volunteering for the nominating
committee.


</li>
<li><sup><small>64</small></sup>Members of the IETF community must have attended at least 3 of the
last 5 IETF meetings in order to volunteer.

<br />
<br />
The 5 meetings are the five most recent meetings
that ended prior to the date on which the solicitation for nominating
committee volunteers was submitted for distribution to the IETF
community.

<br />
<br />
The IETF Secretariat is responsible for
confirming that volunteers have met the attendance requirement.

<br />
<br />
Volunteers must provide their full name, email
address, and primary company or organization affiliation (if any) when
volunteering.

<br />
<br />
Volunteers are expected to be familiar with the
IETF processes and procedures, which are readily learned by active
participation in a working group and especially by serving as a document
editor or working group chair.


</li>
<li><sup><small>65</small></sup>Members of the Internet Society Board of Trustees, sitting
  members of IAOC, sitting members of the IAB, and sitting members
  of the IESG may not volunteer to serve on the nominating
  committee.
</li>
<li><sup><small>66</small></sup>The Chair announces both the list of the pool of volunteers from
which the 10 voting volunteers will be randomly selected and the method
with which the selection will be completed.

<br />
<br />
 The announcement should be made at least 1 week
prior to the date on which the random selection will occur.

<br />
<br />
 The pool of volunteers must be enumerated or
otherwise indicated according to the needs of the selection method to be
used.

<br />
<br />
 The announcement must specify the data that
will be used as input to the selection method.  The method must depend
on random data whose value is not known or available until the date on
which the random selection will occur.

<br />
<br />
 It must be possible to independently verify
that the selection method used is both fair and unbiased.  A method is
fair if each eligible volunteer is equally likely to be selected.  A
method is unbiased if no one can influence its outcome in favor of a
specific outcome.

<br />
<br />
 It must be possible to repeat the selection
method, either through iteration or by restarting in such a way as
to remain both fair and unbiased.  This is necessary to replace
selected volunteers should they become unavailable after selection.

<br />
<br />
The selection method must produce an ordered
list of volunteers.

<br />
<br />
 One possible selection method is described in
<a class='info' href='#RFC3797'>RFC3797<span> (</span><span class='info'>Eastlake, D., &ldquo;Publicly Verifiable   Nominations Committee (NomCom) Random Selection,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3797].


</li>
<li><sup><small>67</small></sup>The Chair randomly selects the 10 voting volunteers from the pool of
names of volunteers and announces the members of the nominating
committee.

<br />
<br />
No more than two volunteers with the same
primary affiliation may be selected for the nominating committee.  The
Chair reviews the primary affiliation of each volunteer selected by the
method in turn.  If the primary affiliation for a volunteer is the same
as two previously selected volunteers, that volunteer is removed from
consideration and the method is repeated to identify the next eligible
volunteer.

<br />
<br />
There must be at least two announcements of all
members of the nominating committee.

<br />
<br />
The first announcement should occur as soon
after the random selection as is reasonable for the Chair.  The
community must have at least 1 week during which any person from the
community may challenge the results of the random selection.

<br />
<br />
The challenge must be made in writing (email
is acceptable) to the Chair.  The Chair has 48 hours to review the
challenge and offer a resolution to the challenger.  If the
resolution is not accepted by the challenger, that challenger may
report the challenge according to the dispute resolution process
stated elsewhere in this document.

<br />
<br />
If a selected volunteer, upon reading the
announcement with the list of selected volunteers, finds that two or
more other volunteers have the same affiliation, then the volunteer
should notify the Chair who will determine the appropriate action.

<br />
<br />
During at least the 1 week challenge period the
Chair must contact each of the members and confirm their willingness and
availability to serve.  The Chair should make every reasonable effort to
contact each member.


<ul class="text">
<li><sup><small>68</small></sup>If the Chair is unable to contact a liaison the problem is referred
to the respective organization to resolve.  The Chair should allow a
reasonable amount of time for the organization to resolve the problem
and then may proceed without the liaison.
</li>
<li><sup><small>69</small></sup>If the Chair is unable to contact an advisor the Chair may elect to
proceed without the advisor, except for the prior year's Chair for whom
the Chair must consult with the Internet Society President as stated
elsewhere in this document.
</li>
<li><sup><small>70</small></sup>If the Chair is unable to contact a voting volunteer the Chair must
repeat the random selection process in order to replace the unavailable
volunteer.  There should be at least 1 day between the announcement of
the iteration and the selection process.
</li>
</ul>

<br />
<br />
After at least 1 week and confirming that 10
voting volunteers are ready to serve, the Chair makes the second
announcement of the members of the nominating committee, which
officially begins the term of the nominating committee.


</li>
<li><sup><small>71</small></sup>The Chair works with the members of the committee to organize itself
in preparation for completing its assigned duties.

<br />
<br />
The committee has approximately one month during
which it can self-organize.  Its responsibilities during this time
include but are not limited to the following.


<ul class="text">
<li><sup><small>72</small></sup>Setting up a regular teleconference schedule.
</li>
<li><sup><small>73</small></sup>Setting up an internal web site.
</li>
<li><sup><small>74</small></sup>Setting up a mailing list for internal discussions.
</li>
<li><sup><small>75</small></sup>Setting up an email address for receiving community input.
</li>
<li><sup><small>76</small></sup>Establishing operational procedures.
</li>
<li><sup><small>77</small></sup>Establishing milestones in order to monitor the progress of the
selection and confirmation process.

Nominating Committee Operation</h3>

<p><sup><small>78</small></sup>The following rules apply to the operation of the nominating
committee.  If necessary, a paragraph discussing the interpretation of
each rule is included.
</p>
<p><sup><small>79</small></sup>The rules are organized approximately in the order in which they
would be invoked.



</p>
<ol class="text">
<li><sup><small>80</small></sup>All rules and special circumstances not otherwise specified are at
the discretion of the committee.

<br />
<br />
 Exceptional circumstances will occasionally
arise during the normal operation of the nominating committee.  This
rule is intended to foster the continued forward progress of the
committee.

<br />
<br />
 Any member of the committee may propose a rule
for adoption by the committee.  The rule must be approved by the
committee according to its established voting mechanism.

<br />
<br />
 All members of the committee should consider
whether the exception is worthy of mention in the next revision of this
document and follow-up accordingly.


</li>
<li><sup><small>81</small></sup>The completion of the process of selecting candidates to be confirmed
by their respective confirming body is due within 3 months.

<br />
<br />
The completion of the selection process is due
at least two month's prior to the First IETF.  This ensures the
nominating committee has sufficient time to complete the confirmation
process.


</li>
<li><sup><small>82</small></sup>The completion of the process of confirming the candidates is due
within 1 month.

<br />
<br />
The completion of the confirmation process is
due at least one month prior to the First IETF.


</li>
<li><sup><small>83</small></sup>The Chair must establish for the nominating committee a set of
milestones for the candidate selection and confirmation process.

<br />
<br />
There is a defined time period during which the
candidate selection and confirmation process must be completed.  The
Chair must establish a set of milestones which, if met in a timely
fashion, will result in the completion of the process on time.  The
Chair should allow time for iterating the activities of the committee if
one or more candidates is not confirmed.

<br />
<br />
The Chair should ensure that all committee
members are aware of the milestones.


</li>
<li><sup><small>84</small></sup>The Chair must establish a voting mechanism.

<br />
<br />
 The committee must be able to objectively
determine when a decision has been made during its deliberations.  The
criteria for determining closure must be established and known to all
members of the nominating committee.


</li>
<li><sup><small>85</small></sup>At least a quorum of committee members must participate in a vote.

<br />
<br />
Only voting volunteers vote on a candidate
selection.  For a candidate selection vote a quorum is comprised of at
least 7 of the voting volunteers.

<br />
<br />
At all other times a quorum is present if at
least 75% of the nominating committee members are participating.


</li>
<li><sup><small>86</small></sup>Any member of the nominating committee may propose to the committee
that any other member except the Chair be recalled.  The process for
recalling the Chair is defined elsewhere in this document.

<br />
<br />
There are a variety of ordinary circumstances
that may arise that could result in one or more members of the committee
being unavailable to complete their assigned duties, for example health
concerns, family issues, or a change of priorities at work.  A committee
member may choose to resign for unspecified personal reasons.  In
addition, the committee may not function well as a group because a
member may be disruptive or otherwise uncooperative.

<br />
<br />
Regardless of the circumstances, if individual
committee members can not work out their differences between themselves,
the entire committee may be called upon to discuss and review the
circumstances.  If a resolution is not forthcoming a vote may be
conducted.  A member may be recalled if at least a quorum of all
committee members agree, including the vote of the member being
recalled.

<br />
<br />
If a liaison member is recalled the committee
must notify the affected organization and must allow a reasonable amount
of time for a replacement to be identified by the organization before
proceeding.

<br />
<br />
If an advisor member other than the prior year's
Chair is recalled, the committee may choose to proceed without the
advisor.  In the case of the prior year's Chair, the Internet Society
President must be notified and the current Chair must be allowed a
reasonable amount of time to consult with the Internet Society President
to identify a replacement before proceeding.

<br />
<br />
If a voting volunteer member is recalled,
regardless of the circumstances, the committee may choose to proceed
with only 9 voting volunteers at its own discretion.  In all other cases
the Chair must repeat the random selection process including an
announcement of the iteration prior to the actual selection as stated
elsewhere in this document.

<br />
<br />
A change in the primary affiliation of a voting
volunteer during the term of the nominating committee is not a cause to
request the recall of that volunteer, even if the change would result in
more than two voting volunteers with the same affiliation.


</li>
<li><sup><small>87</small></sup>Only the prior year's Chair may request the recall of the current
Chair.

<br />
<br />
It is the responsibility of the prior year's
Chair to ensure the current Chair completes the assigned tasks in a
manner consistent with this document and in the best interests of the
IETF community.

<br />
<br />
Any member of the committee who has an issue or
concern regarding the Chair should report it to the prior year's Chair
immediately.  The prior year's Chair is expected to report it to the
Chair immediately.  If they can not resolve the issue between
themselves, the prior year's Chair must report it according to the
dispute resolution process stated elsewhere in this document.


</li>
<li><sup><small>88</small></sup>All members of the nominating committee may participate in all
deliberations.

<br />
<br />
 The emphasis of this rule is that no member can
be explicitly excluded from any deliberation.  However, a member may
individually choose not to participate in a deliberation.


</li>
<li><sup><small>89</small></sup>The Chair announces the open positions to be reviewed, the desired
expertise provided by the IETF Executive Director, and the call for
nominees.

<br />
<br />
 The call for nominees must include a request for
comments regarding the past performance of incumbents, which will be
considered during the deliberations of the nominating committee.

<br />
<br />
 The call must request that a nomination include
a valid, working email address, a telephone number, or both for the
nominee.  The nomination must include the set of skills or expertise the
nominator believes the nominee has that would be desirable.


</li>
<li><sup><small>90</small></sup>Any member of the IETF community may nominate any member of the IETF
community for any open position, whose eligibility to serve will be
confirmed by the nominating committee.

<br />
<br />
A self-nomination is permitted.

<br />
<br />
Nominating committee members are not eligible to
be considered for filling any open position by the nominating committee
on which they serve.  They become ineligible as soon as the term of the
nominating committee on which they serve officially begins.  They remain
ineligible for the duration of that nominating committee's term.

<br />
<br />
Although each nominating committee's term
overlaps with the following nominating committee's term, nominating
committee members are eligible for nomination by the following committee
if not otherwise disqualified.

<br />
<br />
Members of the IETF community who were
recalled from any position during the previous two years are not
eligible to be considered for filling any open position.


</li>
<li><sup><small>91</small></sup>The nominating committee selects candidates based on its
understanding of the IETF community's consensus of the qualifications
required to fill the open positions.

<br />
<br />
The intent of this rule is to ensure that the
nominating committee consults with a broad base of the IETF community
for input to its deliberations.  In particular, the nominating committee
must determine if the desired expertise for the open positions matches
its understanding of the qualifications desired by the IETF community.

<br />
<br />
The consultations are permitted to include names
of nominees, if all parties to the consultation agree to observe the
same confidentiality rules as the nominating committee itself.

<br />
<br />
A broad base of the community should include
the existing members of the bodies with open positions, especially
sitting members who share responsibilities with open positions,
e.g., co-Area Directors, and working group chairs, especially those
in the areas with open positions.

<br />
<br />
Only voting volunteer members vote to select
candidates.


</li>
<li><sup><small>92</small></sup>Nominees should be advised that they are being considered and must
consent to their nomination prior to being chosen as candidates.

<br />
<br />
 Although the nominating committee will make
every reasonable effort to contact and to remain in contact with
nominees, any nominee whose contact information changes during the
process and who wishes to still be considered should inform the
nominating committee of the changes.

<br />
<br />
 A nominee's consent must be written (email is
acceptable) and must include a commitment to provide the resources
necessary to fill the open position and an assurance that the nominee
will perform the duties of the position for which they are being
considered in the best interests of the IETF community.

<br />
<br />
 Consenting to a nomination must occur prior to
a nominee being a candidate and may occur as soon after the nomination
as needed by the nominating committee.

<br />
<br />
 Consenting to a nomination must not imply the
nominee will be a candidate.

<br />
<br />
 The nominating committee should help nominees
provide justification to their employers.


</li>
<li><sup><small>93</small></sup>The nominating committee advises the confirming bodies of their
candidates, specifying a single candidate for each open position and
testifying as to how each candidate meets the qualifications of an open
position.

<br />
<br />
 For each candidate, the testimony must include
a brief statement of the qualifications for the position that is being
filled, which may be exactly the expertise that was requested.  If the
qualifications differ from the expertise originally requested a brief
statement explaining the difference must be included.

<br />
<br />
 The testimony may include either or both of a
brief resume of the candidate and a brief summary of the deliberations
of the nominating committee.


</li>
<li><sup><small>94</small></sup>Confirmed candidates must consent to their confirmation and rejected
candidates and nominees must be notified before confirmed candidates are
announced.

<br />
<br />
 It is not necessary to notify and get consent
from all confirmed candidates together.

<br />
<br />
 A nominee may not know they were a candidate.
This permits a candidate to be rejected by a confirming body without the
nominee knowing about the rejection.

<br />
<br />
 Rejected nominees, who consented to their
nomination, and rejected candidates must be notified prior to announcing
the confirmed candidates.

<br />
<br />
 It is not necessary to announce all confirmed
candidates together.

<br />
<br />
 The nominating committee must ensure that all
confirmed candidates are prepared to serve prior to announcing their
confirmation.


</li>
<li><sup><small>95</small></sup>The nominating committee should archive the information it has
collected or produced for a period of time not to exceed its term.

<br />
<br />
The purpose of the archive is to assist the
nominating committee should it be necessary for it to fill a mid-term
vacancy.

<br />
<br />
The existence of an archive, how it is
implemented, and what information to archive is at the discretion of the
committee.  The decision must be approved by a quorum of the voting
volunteer members.

<br />
<br />
The implementation of the archive should make
every reasonable effort to ensure that the confidentiality of the
information it contains is maintained.

Dispute Resolution Process</h3>

<p><sup><small>96</small></sup>The dispute resolution process described here is to be used as
indicated elsewhere in this document.  Its applicability in other
circumstances is beyond the scope of this document.
</p>
<p><sup><small>97</small></sup>The nominating committee operates under a strict rule of
confidentiality.  For this reason when process issues arise it is best
to make every reasonable effort to resolve them within the committee.
However, when circumstances do not permit this or no resolution is
forthcoming, the process described here is to be used.
</p>
<p><sup><small>98</small></sup>The following rules apply to the process.

</p>
<ol class="text">
<li><sup><small>99</small></sup>The results of this process are final and binding.  There is no
appeal.
</li>
<li><sup><small>100</small></sup>The process begins with the submission of a request as described
below to the Internet Society President.
</li>
<li><sup><small>101</small></sup>As soon as the process begins, the nominating committee may continue
those activities that are unrelated to the issue to be resolved except
that it must not submit any candidates to a confirming body until the
issue is resolved.
</li>
<li><sup><small>102</small></sup>All parties to the process are subject to the same confidentiality
rules as each member of the nominating committee.
</li>
<li><sup><small>103</small></sup>The process should be completed within two weeks.
</li>
</ol><p>


</p>
<p><sup><small>104</small></sup>The process is as follows.

</p>
<ol class="text">
<li><sup><small>105</small></sup>The party seeking resolution submits a written request (email is
acceptable) to the Internet Society President detailing the issue to be
resolved.
</li>
<li><sup><small>106</small></sup>The Internet Society President appoints an arbiter to investigate and
resolve the issue.  A self-appointment is permitted.
</li>
<li><sup><small>107</small></sup>The arbiter investigates the issue making every reasonable effort to
understand both sides of the issue.  Since the arbiter is subject to the
same confidentiality obligations as all nominating committee members,
all members are expect to cooperate fully with the arbiter and to
provide all relevant information to the arbiter for review.
</li>
<li><sup><small>108</small></sup>After consultation with the two principal parties to the issue, the
arbiter decides on a resolution.  Whatever actions are necessary to
execute the resolution are immediately begun and completed as quickly as
possible.
</li>
<li><sup><small>109</small></sup>The arbiter summarizes the issue, the resolution, and the rationale
for the resolution for the Internet Society President.
</li>
<li><sup><small>110</small></sup>In consultation with the Internet Society President, the arbiter
prepares a report of the dispute and its resolution.  The report should
include all information that in the judgement of the arbiter does not
violate the confidentiality requirements of the nominating
committee.
</li>
<li><sup><small>111</small></sup>The Chair includes the dispute report when reporting on the
activities of the nominating committee to the IETF community.

Member Recall</h3>

<p><sup><small>112</small></sup>The following rules apply to the recall process.  If necessary, a
paragraph discussing the interpretation of each rule is included.

</p>
<ol class="text">
<li><sup><small>113</small></sup>At any time, at least 20 members of the IETF community, who are
qualified to be voting members of a nominating committee, may
request by signed petition (email is acceptable) to the Internet
Society President the recall of any sitting of a body with members
to which this document applies.

<br />
<br />
All individual and collective qualifications of
nominating committee eligibility are applicable, including that no more
than two signatories may have the same primary affiliation.

<br />
<br />
Each signature must include a full name, email
address, and primary company or organization affiliation.

<br />
<br />
The IETF Secretariat is responsible for
confirming that each signatory is qualified to be a voting member of a
nominating committee.  A valid petition must be signed by at least 20
qualified signatories.

<br />
<br />
The petition must include a statement of
justification for the recall and all relevant and appropriate supporting
documentation.

<br />
<br />
The petition and its signatories must be
announced to the IETF community.


</li>
<li><sup><small>114</small></sup>Internet Society President shall appoint a Recall Committee Chair.

<br />
<br />
 The Internet Society President must not evaluate
the recall request.  It is explicitly the responsibility of the IETF
community to evaluate the behavior of its leaders.


</li>
<li><sup><small>115</small></sup>The recall committee is created according to the same rules as is the
nominating committee with the qualifications that both the person being
investigated and the parties requesting the recall must not be a member
of the recall committee in any capacity.


</li>
<li><sup><small>116</small></sup>The recall committee operates according to the same rules as the
nominating committee with the qualification that there is no
confirmation process.


</li>
<li><sup><small>117</small></sup>The recall committee investigates the circumstances of the
justification for the recall and votes on its findings.

<br />
<br />
 The investigation must include at least both an
opportunity for the member being recalled to present a written statement
and consultation with third parties.


</li>
<li><sup><small>118</small></sup>A 3/4 majority of the members who vote on the question is required
for a recall.


</li>
<li><sup><small>119</small></sup>If a sitting member is recalled the open position is to be filled
according to the mid-term vacancy rules.

<p><sup><small>122</small></sup>There have been a number of people involved with the development of
this document over the years as it has progressed from RFC2027 through
RFC2282, RFC2727, and RFC3777 to its current version.
</p>
<p><sup><small>123</small></sup>A great deal of credit goes to the first three Nominating Committee

documented process.  It was their fine work and oral tradition that
became the first version of this document.
</p>
<p><sup><small>128</small></sup>Of course we can not overlook the bug discovery burden that each of
the Chairs since the first publication have had to endure:

</p>
<p><sup><small>143</small></sup>The bulk of the early credit goes to the members of the POISSON

Scott Bradner and John Klensin, who consistently contributed to the
improvement of the first three versions of this document.
</p>
<p><sup><small>144</small></sup>In January 2002 a new working group was formed, the Nominating

Security Considerations</h3>

<p><sup><small>152</small></sup>Any selection, confirmation, or recall process necessarily involves
investigation into the qualifications and activities of prospective
candidates.  The investigation may reveal confidential or otherwise
private information about candidates to those participating in the
process.  Each person who participates in any aspect of the process must
maintain the confidentiality of any and all information not explicitly
identified as suitable for public dissemination.
</p>
<p><sup><small>153</small></sup>When the nominating committee decides it is necessary to share
confidential or otherwise private information with others, the
dissemination must be minimal and must include a prior commitment from
all persons consulted to observe the same confidentiality rules as the
nominating committee itself.

Oral Tradition</h3>

<p><sup><small>157</small></sup>Over the years various nominating committees have learned through
oral tradition passed on by liaisons that there are certain
consistencies in the process and information considered during
deliberations.  Some items from that oral tradition are collected here
to facilitate its consideration by future nominating committees.

</p>
<ol class="text">
<li><sup><small>158</small></sup>It has been found that experience as an IETF Working Group Chair
or an IRTF Research Group Chair is helpful in giving a nominee
experience of what the job of an Area Director involves.  It is also
helps a nominating committee judge the technical, people, and
process management skills of the nominee.
</li>
<li><sup><small>159</small></sup>No person should serve both on the IAB and as an Area Director,
except the IETF Chair whose roles as an IAB member and Area Director
of the General Area are set out elsewhere.
</li>
<li><sup><small>160</small></sup>The strength of the IAB is found in part in the balance of the
demographics of its members (e.g., national distribution, years of
experience, gender, etc.), the combined skill set of its members,
and the combined sectors (e.g., industry, academia, etc.)
represented by its members.
</li>
<li><sup><small>161</small></sup>There are no term limits explicitly because the issue of
continuity versus turnover should be evaluated each year according
to the expectations of the IETF community, as it is understood by
each nominating committee.
</li>
<li><sup><small>162</small></sup>The number of nominating committee members with the same primary
affiliation is limited in order to avoid the appearance of improper
bias in choosing the leadership of the IETF.  Rather than defining
precise rules for how to define "affiliation," the IETF community
depends on the honor and integrity of the participants to make the
process work.

Nominating Committee Timeline</h3>

<p><sup><small>163</small></sup>This appendix is included for the convenience of the reader and is
not to be interpreted as the definitive timeline.  It is intended to
capture the detail described elsewhere in this document in one place.
Although every effort has been made to ensure the description here is
consistent with the description elsewhere, if there are any conflicts
the definitive rule is the one in the main body of this document.
</p>
<p><sup><small>164</small></sup>The only absolute in the timeline rules for the annual process is
that its completion is due by the First IETF of the year after the
nominating committee begins its term.  This is supported by the fact
that the confirmed candidate terms begin during the week of the First
IETF.
</p>
<p><sup><small>165</small></sup>The overall annual process is designed to be completed in 7 months.
It is expected to start 8 months prior to the First IETF.  The 7 months
is split between three major components of the process as follows.

</p>
<ol class="text">
<li><sup><small>166</small></sup>First is the selection and organization of the committee members.
Three months are allotted for this process.
</li>
<li><sup><small>167</small></sup>Second is the selection of the candidates by the nominating
committee.  Three months are allotted for this process.
</li>
<li><sup><small>168</small></sup>Third is the confirmation of the candidates by their respective
confirming bodies.  One month is allotted for this process
</li>
</ol><p>


</p>
<p><sup><small>169</small></sup>The following figure captures the details of the milestones within
each component.  For illustrative purposes the figure presumes the
Friday before the First IETF is March 1.

0. BEGIN 8 Months Prior to First IETF (approx. July 1); Internet
   Society President appoints the Chair.  The appointment must be
   done no later than the Second IETF or 8 months prior to the First
   IETF, whichever comes first.  The Chair must be announced and
   recognized during a plenary session of the Second IETF.

1. The Chair establishes and announces milestones to ensure the
   timely selection of the nominating committee members.

2. The Chair contacts the IESG, IAB, and Internet Society Board of
   Trustees and requests a liaison.  The Chair contacts the prior
   year's Chair and requests an advisor.  The Chair obtains the list
   of IESG and IAB open positions and descriptions from the IETF
   Executive Director.

3. The Chair announces the solicitation for voting volunteer members
   that must remain open for at least 30 days.  The announcement must
   be done no later than 7 months and 2 weeks prior to the First IETF
   (approx. July 15).

4. After the solicitation closes the Chair announces the pool of
   volunteers and the date of the random selection, which must be at
   least 1 week in the future.  The announcement must be done no
   later than 6 months and 2 weeks prior to the First IETF
   (approx. August 15).

5. On the appointed day the random selection occurs and the Chair
   announces the members of the committee and the 1 week challenge
   period.  The announcement must be done no later than 6 months and
   1 week prior to the First IETF (approx. August 22).

6. During the challenge period the Chair contacts each of the
   committee members and confirms their availability to participate.

7. After the challenge period closes the Chair announces the members of
   the committee and its term begins.  The announcement must be done no
   later than 6 months prior to the First IETF (approx. September 1).

8. The committee has one month during which it is to self-organize in
   preparation for completing its assigned duties.  This must be done no
   later than 5 months prior to the First IETF (approx. October 1).

9. END the Committee Member Selection Process; BEGIN the Selection of
   Candidates; Time is at least 5 months prior to the First IETF
  (approx. October 1).

10. The Chair establishes and announces the milestones to ensure the
    timely selection of the candidates, including a call for
    nominations for the open positions.  The announcement must be done
    no later than 5 months prior to the First IETF (approx. October
    1).

11. Over the next 3 months the nominating committee collects input and
    deliberates.  It should plan to conduct interviews and other
    consultations during the Third IETF.  The committee is due to
    complete its candidate selection no later than 2 months prior to the
    First IETF (approx. January 1).

12. END the Selection of Candidates; BEGIN the Confirmation of
    Candidates; Time is at least 2 months prior to the First IETF
    (approx. January 1);

13. The committee presents its candidates to their respective confirming
    bodies.  The presentation must be done no later than 2 months prior
    to the First IETF (approx. January 1).

14. The confirming bodies have 1 month to deliberate and, in
    communication with the nominating committee, accept or reject
    candidates.

15. The Chair announces the confirmed candidates.  The announcement
    must be done no later than 1 month prior to the First IETF
    (approx. February 1).
