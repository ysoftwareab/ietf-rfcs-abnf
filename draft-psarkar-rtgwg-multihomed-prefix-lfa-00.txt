1.  Introduction

   The use of Loop-Free Alternates (LFA) for IP Fast Reroute is
   specified in [RFC5286].  Section 6.1 of [RFC5286] describes a method
   to determine loop-free alternates for a multi-homed prefixes (MHPs).
   This document describes a procedure using explicit inequalities that
   can be used by a computing router to evaluate a neighbour as a
   potential alternate for a multi-homed prefix.  The results obtained
   are equivalent to those obtained using the method described in
   Section 6.1 of [RFC5286].  However, some may find this formulation
   useful.

   Section 6.3 of [RFC5286] discusses complications associated with
   computing LFAs for multi-homed prefixes in OSPF.  This document

Internet-Draft   LFA selection for Multi-Homed Prefixes     October 2014


   provides detailed criteria for evaluating potential alternates for
   external prefixes advertised by OSPF ASBRs, as well as explicit
   inequalities.

2.  LFA inequalities for MHPs

   The following set of inequalities can be used to evaluate LFAs for
   multi-homed prefixes.

   This document proposes the following set of LFA inequalities for
   selecting the most appropriate LFAs for multi-homed prefixes (MHPs).
   They can be derived from the inequalities in [RFC5286] combined with
   the observation that D_opt(N,P) = Min (D_opt(N,PO_i) + cost(PO_i,P))
   over all PO_i

   Link-Protection:
   D_opt(N,PO_i)+ cost(PO_i,P) < D_opt(N,S) +
                                    D_opt(S,PO_best) + cost (PO_best,P)

   Link-Protection + Downstream-paths-only:
   D_opt(N,PO_i)+ cost(PO_i,P) < D_opt(S,PO_best) + cost (PO_best,P)

   Node-Protection:
   D_opt(N,PO_i)+ cost(PO_i,P) < D_opt(N,E) +
                                    D_opt(E,PO_best) + cost (PO_best,P)

   Where,
      S            - The computing router
      N            - The alternate router being evaluated
      E            - The primary next-hop on shortest path from S to
                     prefix P.
      PO_i         - The specific prefix-originating router being
                     evaluated.
      PO_best      - The prefix-originating router on the shortest path
                     from the computing router S to prefix P.
      Cost (X,P)   - Cost of reaching the prefix P from prefix
                     originating node X.
      D_opt(X,Y)   - Distance on the shortest path from node X to node
                     Y.

                    Figure 1: LFA inequalities for MHPs

   To compute a valid LFA for a given multi-homed prefix P, a computing
   router S shall evaluate for each alternate neighbor N, one of the
   above set of inequalities, once for each remote node that originated
   the prefix.  If the inequality is satisfied by any neighbour N for
   any remote prefix-originating node, router S shall choose neighbour
   N, as one of the valid LFAs for the prefix P.

3.  LFA selection for the multi-homed external routes

   Redistribution of external routes into IGP is required in case of two
   different networks getting merged into one or during protocol
   migrations.  External routes could be distributed into an IGP domain
   via multiple nodes to avoid a single point of failure.  During LFA
   calculation, alternate LFA next-hops to reach the best ASBR could be
   used as LFA for the routes redistributed via that ASBR.  When there
   is no LFA available to the best ASBR, it may be desirable to consider
   the other ASBRs (referred to as alternate ASBR hereafter)
   redistributing the external routes for LFA selection as defined in
   [RFC5286] and leverage the advantage of having multiple re-
   distributing nodes in the network.

3.1.  IS-IS

   LFA evaluation for multi-homed external prefixes in IS-IS is similar
   to the multi-homed internal prefixes.  Inequalities described in sec
   2 would also apply to multi-homed external prefixes as well.

3.2.  OSPF

   Loop free Alternates [RFC 5286] describes mechanisms to apply
   inequalities to find the the loop free alternate neighbour.  For the
   selection of alternate ASBR for LFA consideration, additional rules
   have to be applied in selecting the alternate ASBR due to the
   external route calculation rules imposed by [RFC 2328].  This
   document also defines the inequalities defined in RFC [5286]
   specifically for the alternate loop-free ASBR evaluation.

3.2.1.  Rules to select alternate ASBR

   The process to select an alternate ASBR is best explained using the
   rules below.  The below process is applied when primary ASBR for the
   concerned prefix is chosen and there is an alternate ASBR originating
   same prefix.

   1. If RFC1583Compatibility is disabled

         1a. if primary ASBR and alternate ASBR are intra area
             non-backbone path go to step 2.
         1b. If primary ASBR and alternate ASBR belong to
             intra-area backbone and/or inter-area path go
             to step 2.
         1c. for other paths, skip the alternate ASBR and
             consider next ASBR.

   2. If cost type (type1/type2) advertised by alternate
      ASBR same as primary
       2a. If  not same skip alternate ASBR and consider next ASBR.

   3. If cost type is type1
         3a. If cost is same, program ECMP
         3b. else go to step 5.

   4  If cost type is type 2
         4a. If cost is different, skip alternate ASBR and
             consider next ASBR
         4b. If type2 cost is same, compare type 1 cost.
         4c. If type1 cost is also same program ECMP.
         4d. If type 1 cost is different go to step 5.

   5. If route type (type 5/type 7)
          5a. If route type is same, check route p-bit,
              forwarding address field for routes from both
              ASBRs
              match. If not skip alternate ASBR and consider
              next ASBR.
          5b. If route type is not same, skip ASBR
              and consider next ASBR.

    6. Apply inequality on the alternate ASBR.

           Figure 2: Rules for selecting alternate ASBR in OSPF

3.2.2.  Multiple ASBRs belonging different area

   When "RFC1583compatibility" is set to disabled, OSPF[RFC2328] defines
   certain rules of preference to choose the ASBRs.  While selecting
   alternate ASBR for loop evaluation for LFA, these rules should be
   applied and ensured that the alternate neighbour does not loop the
   traffic back.

   When there are multiple ASBRs belonging to different area advertising
   the same prefix, pruning rules as defined in RFC 2328 section 16.4.1

   are applied.  The alternate ASBRs pruned using above rules are not
   considered for LFA evaluation.

3.2.3.  Type 1 and Type 2 costs

   If there are multiple ASBRs not pruned via rules defined in 3.2.2,
   the cost type advertised by the ASBRs is compared.  ASBRs advertising
   Type1 costs are preferred and the type2 costs are pruned.If two ASBRs
   advertise same type2 cost, the alternate ASBRs are considered along
   with their type1 cost for evaluation.If the two ASBRs with same type2
   as well as type1 cost, ECMP FRR is programmed.If there are two ASBRs
   with different type2 cost, the higher cost ASBR is pruned.The
   inequalities for evaluating alternate ASBR for type 1 and type 2
   costs are same, as the alternate ASBRs with different type2 costs are
   pruned and the evaluation is based on equal type 2 cost ASBRS.

3.2.4.  RFC1583compatibility is set to enabled

   When RFC1583Compatibility is set to enabled, multiple ASBRs belonging
   to different area advertising same prefix are chosen based on cost
   and hence are valid alternate ASBRs for the LFA evaluation.

3.2.5.  Type 7 routes

   Type 5 routes always get preference over Type 7 and the alternate
   ASBRs chosen for LFA calculation should belong to same type.Among
   Type 7 routes, routes with p-bit and forwarding address set have
   higher preference than routes without these attributes.  Alternate
   ASBRs selected for LFA comparison should have same p-bit and
   forwarding address attributes.

3.2.6.  Inequalities to be applied for alternate ASBR selection

   The alternate ASBRs selected using above mechanism described in
   3.2.1, are evaluated for Loop free criteria using below inequalities.
