<h1><br />MPLS-TP OAM Analysis<br />draft-ietf-mpls-tp-oam-analysis-00.txt</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>This document analyzes the set of requirements for Operations, Administration, 
	  and Maintenance (OAM) for the Transport Profile of MPLS(MPLS-TP) as defined in 
	  <a class='info' href='#MPLS-TP OAM Reqs'>[MPLS&#8209;TP OAM Reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vigoureux, M., Betts, M., and D. Ward, &ldquo;Requirements for OAM in MPLS Transport Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>, to evaluate whether existing OAM tools (either 
	  from the current MPLS toolset or from the ITU-T documents) can be applied to these 
	  requirements. Eventually, the purpose of the document is to recommend which of the 
	  existing tools should be extended and what new tools should be defined to support 
	  the set of OAM requirements for MPLS-TP.  This document reports the conclusions 
	  of the MPLS-TP design team discussions concerning the MPLS-TP OAM tools at IETF75.

Scope</h3>

<p>OAM (Operations, Administration, and Maintenance) plays a significant
        role in carrier networks, providing methods for fault management and 
		performance monitoring in both the transport and the service layers in order 
		to improve their ability to support services with guaranteed and strict 
		Service Level Agreements (SLAs) while reducing their operational costs.
</p>
<p><a class='info' href='#MPLS-TP Reqs'>[MPLS&#8209;TP Reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Niven-Jenkins, B., Nadeau, T., and C. Pignataro, &ldquo;Requirements for the Trasport Profile of MPLS,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> in general, and <a class='info' href='#MPLS-TP OAM Reqs'>[MPLS&#8209;TP OAM Reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vigoureux, M., Betts, M., and D. Ward, &ldquo;Requirements for OAM in MPLS Transport Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> 
        in particular define a set of requirements for OAM functionality in MPLS-Transport 
        Profile (MPLS-TP) for MPLS-TP Label Switched Paths (LSPs) (network infrastructure) 
        and Pseudowires (PWs) (services).
</p>
<p>The purpose of this document is to analyze the OAM requirements and 
        evaluate whether existing OAM tools defined for MPLS can be used to 
        meet the requirements, identify which tools need to be extended to 
        comply with the requirements, and which new tools need to be defined.  We also 
        take the ITU-T OAM toolset, as defined in <a class='info' href='#Y.1731'>[Y.1731]<span> (</span><span class='info'>International Telecommunications Union - Standardization, &ldquo;OAM functions and mechanisms for Ethernet based networks,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>, as a candidate to base 
        these new tools upon. The existing tools that are evaluated include LSP Ping 
        (defined in <a class='info' href='#LSP Ping'>[LSP Ping]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kompella, K. and G. Swallow, &ldquo;Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data Plane Failures,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>), MPLS Bi-directional Forwarding Detection (BFD) 
        (defined in <a class='info' href='#BASE BFD'>[BASE BFD]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Katz, D. and D. Ward, &ldquo;Bidirectional Forwarding Detection,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>) and Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification

        ITU-T OAM toolset defined in <a class='info' href='#Y.1731'>[Y.1731]<span> (</span><span class='info'>International Telecommunications Union - Standardization, &ldquo;OAM functions and mechanisms for Ethernet based networks,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>This document reports the conclusions of the MPLS-TP design team discussions 
		on the MPLS-TP OAM tools at IETF75 and the guidelines that were agreed.  The 
		guidelines refer to a set of existing OAM tools that need to be enhanced to 
		fully support the MPLS-TP OAM requirements and identify new tools that need 
		to be defined. The organizational structure of the documents on MPLS-TP OAM tools 
		was also discussed and agreed at IETF75 and is described later in this document.

Organization of the document</h3>

<p>Sections 1.3 &ndash; 1.6 provide an overview of the existing MPLS tools.
</p>
<p>Section 2 of the document analyzes the requirements that are documented in 
		<a class='info' href='#MPLS-TP OAM Reqs'>[MPLS&#8209;TP OAM Reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vigoureux, M., Betts, M., and D. Ward, &ldquo;Requirements for OAM in MPLS Transport Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> and provides basic principles of operation for the OAM 
		functionality that is required.
</p>
<p>Section 3 evaluates which existing tools can provide coverage for the different 
		OAM functions that are required to support MPLS-TP.
</p>
<p>The recommendations are summarized in section 4, and reflect the guidelines which 
		were agreed by the MPLS-TP design team during the meetings at IETF 75.  These 
		guidelines relate to the functionality could be covered by the existing toolset and 
		what extensions or new tools would be needed in order to provide full coverage of 
		the OAM functionality for MPLS-TP.
</p>
<p>The OAM tools for MPLS-TP OAM will be defined in a set of documents. Section 5 
		describes the organization of this set of documents as agreed by the MPLS-TP design 
		team at IETF75.

<a name="rfc.section.1.3"></a><h3>1.3.&nbsp;
LSP Ping</h3>

<p>LSP Ping is a variation of ICMP Ping and traceroute <a class='info' href='#ICMP'>[ICMP]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J., &ldquo;Internet Control Message Protocol,&rdquo; Sept&nbsp;1981.</span><span>)</span></a> adapted 
		to the needs of MPLS LSP.  Forwarding, of the LSP Ping packets, is 
        based upon the LSP Label and label stack, in order to guarantee that the 
        echo messages are switched in-band (i.e. over the same data route) of the LSP.
        However, it should be noted that the messages are transmitted using IP/UDP 
        encapsulation and IP addresses in the 127/8 (loopback) range.  The use of 
        the loopback range guarantees that the LSP Ping messages will be terminated, 
        by a loss of connectivity or inability to continue on the path, without being 
        transmitted beyond the LSP.  For a bi-directional LSP (either associated or 
		co-routed) the return message of the LSP Ping could be sent on the return LSP.  For 
		unidirectional LSPs and in some case for bi-directional LSPs, the return message 
		may be sent using IP forwarding to the IP address of the LSP ingress node.
</p>
<p>LSP Ping extends the basic ICMP Ping operation (of data-plane connectivity and 
        continuity check) with functionality to verify data-plane vs. control-plane 
        consistency for a Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) and also Maximum Transmission 
        Unit (MTU) problems.  The traceroute functionality may be used to isolate and localize 
        the MPLS faults, using the Time-to-live (TTL) indicator to incrementally identify the 
        sub-path of the LSP that is successfully traversed before the faulty link or node.
</p>
<p>As mentioned above, LSP Ping requires the presenece of the MPLS control plane when
		verifying the consistency of the data-plane against the control-plane.  However, LSP 
        Ping is not dependent on the MPLS control-plane for its operation, i.e. even though the 
        propagation of the LSP label may be performed over the control-plane via the Label 
        Distribution Protocol (LDP).
</p>
<p>It should be noted that LSP Ping does support unique identification of the LSP 
		within an addressing domain.  The identification is checked using the full FEC 
		identification.  LSP Ping is easily extensible to include additional information 
		needed to support new functionality, by use of Type-Length-Value (TLV) constructs.
</p>
<p>LSP Ping can be activated both in on-demand and pro-active (asynchronous)
        modes, as defined in <a class='info' href='#MPLS-TP OAM Reqs'>[MPLS&#8209;TP OAM Reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vigoureux, M., Betts, M., and D. Ward, &ldquo;Requirements for OAM in MPLS Transport Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.

Farrel, &ldquo;Detecting Data Plane Failures in Point-to-Multipoint Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) - Extensions to LSP Ping,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> clarifies the applicability of LSP Ping to MPLS P2MP 
        LSPs, and extends the techniques and mechanisms of LSP Ping to the MPLS 
        P2MP environment.

        tunnels or for a stitched LSP.
</p>
<p>As pointed out above, TTL exhaust is the method used to terminate flows at
        intermediate LSRs.  This is used as part of the traceroute of a path and to locate a 
		problem that was discovered previously.
</p>
<p>Some of the drawbacks identified with LSP Ping include - LSP Ping is considered 
        to be computational intensive as pointed out in <a class='info' href='#MPLS BFD'>[MPLS BFD]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Aggarwal, R., Kompella, K., Nadeau, T., and G. Swallow, &ldquo;BFD For MPLS LSPs,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.  The 
		applicability for a pro-active mode of operation is analyzed in the sections below.  
		Use of the loopback address range (to protect against leakage outside the LSP) 
		assumes that all of the intermediate nodes support some IP functionality.  Note 
		that ECMP is not supported in MPLS-TP, therefore its implication on OAM 
		capabilities is not analyzed in this document.

MPLS BFD</h3>

<p>BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection) <a class='info' href='#BASE BFD'>[BASE BFD]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Katz, D. and D. Ward, &ldquo;Bidirectional Forwarding Detection,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> is a mechanism 
	    that is defined for fast fault detection for point-to-point connections.  BFD defines 
	    a simple packet that may be transmitted over any protocol, dependent on the application 
	    that is employing the mechanism.  BFD is dependent upon creation of a session that 
        is agreed upon by both ends of the link (which may be a single link, LSP, 
        etc.) that is being checked.  The session is assigned a separate identifier by each 
        end of the path being monitored.  This session identifier is by nature only unique 
        within the context of node that assigned it.  As part of the session creation, the 
        end-points negotiate an agreed transmission rate for the BFD packets. BFD supports an 
        echo function to check the continuity, and verify the reachability of the desired 
        destination.  BFD does not support neither a discovery mechanism nor a traceroute 
        capability for fault localization, these must be provided by use of other mechanisms.  
        The BFD packets support authentication between the routers being checked.
</p>
<p>BFD can be used in pro-active (asynchronous) and on-demand modes, as defined 
        in <a class='info' href='#MPLS-TP OAM Reqs'>[MPLS&#8209;TP OAM Reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vigoureux, M., Betts, M., and D. Ward, &ldquo;Requirements for OAM in MPLS Transport Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>, of operation.
</p>
<p><a class='info' href='#MPLS BFD'>[MPLS BFD]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Aggarwal, R., Kompella, K., Nadeau, T., and G. Swallow, &ldquo;BFD For MPLS LSPs,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> defines the use of BFD for P2P LSP end-points and is used to 
        verify data-plane continuity. It uses a simple hello protocol which can be 
        easily implemented in hardware. The end-points of the LSP exchange hello packets 
        at negotiated regular intervals and an end-point is declared down when expected 
        hello packets do not show up.  Failures in each direction can be monitored 
        independently using the same BFD session.  The use of the BFD echo function and 
        on-demand activation are outside the scope of the MPLS BFD specification.
</p>
<p>The BFD session mechanism requires an additional (external) mechanism to 
        bootstrap and bind the session to a particular LSP or FEC.  LSP Ping is designated 
        by <a class='info' href='#MPLS BFD'>[MPLS BFD]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Aggarwal, R., Kompella, K., Nadeau, T., and G. Swallow, &ldquo;BFD For MPLS LSPs,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> as the bootstrap mechanism for the BFD session in an 
        MPLS environment.  The implication is that the session establishment BFD messages for 
        MPLS are transmitted using a IP/UDP encapsulation.
</p>
<p>In order to be able to identify certain extreme cases of mis-connectivity, it is 
        necessary that each managed connection have its own unique identifiers.  BFD uses 
        Discriminator values to identify the connection being verified, at both ends of the path.
        These discriminator values are set by each end-node to be unique only in the context of 
        that node.  This limited scope of uniqueness would not identify a misconnection of crossing 
        paths that could assign the same discriminators to the different sessions.

PW VCCV</h3>

<p><a class='info' href='#PW VCCV'>[PW VCCV]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nadeau, T. and C. Pignataro, &ldquo;Pseudowire Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV): A Control Channel for Pseudowires,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> provides end-to-end fault detection and diagnostics for PWs 
        (regardless of the underlying tunneling technology). The VCCV switching function 
        provides a control channel associated with each PW (based on the PW Associated 
        Channel Header (ACH) which is defined in <a class='info' href='#PW ACH'>[PW ACH]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bryant, S., Swallow, G., Martini, L., and D. McPherson, &ldquo;Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) Control Word for Use over an MPLS PSN,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>), and allows 
        sending OAM packets in-band with PW data (using CC Type 1: In-band VCCV)
</p>
<p>VCCV currently supports the following OAM mechanisms: ICMP Ping, LSP Ping, and BFD. 
        ICMP and LSP Ping are IP encapsulated before being sent over the PW ACH.  BFD for 
        VCCV supports two modes of encapsulation - either IP/UDP encapsulated (with IP/UDP 
        header) or PW-ACH encapsulated (with no IP/UDP header) and provides support to 
        signal the AC status. The use of the VCCV control channel provides the context,
        based on the MPLS-PW label, required to bind and bootstrap the BFD session to a 
        particular pseudo wire (FEC), eliminating the need to exchange Discriminator values.
</p>
<p>VCCV consists of two components: (1) signaled component to communicate 
        VCCV capabilities as part of VC label, and (2) switching component to cause 
        the PW payload to be treated as a control packet.
</p>
<p>VCCV is not directly dependent upon the presence of a control plane. 
	    The VCCV capability negotiation may be performed as part of the PW signaling when LDP is used. 
	    In case of manual configuration of the PW, it is the responsibility of the operator 
	    to set consistent options at both ends.

Architectural requirements and general principles of operation</h3>

            are independent of the transmission media and of the client service 
            being emulated by the PW. The existing tools comply with this 
            requirement.
</li>
<li><a class='info' href='#MPLS-TP OAM Reqs'>[MPLS&#8209;TP OAM Reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vigoureux, M., Betts, M., and D. Ward, &ldquo;Requirements for OAM in MPLS Transport Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> requires that the MPLS-TP OAM MUST be able 
			to support both an IP based and non-IP based environment.  If the network is IP 
			based, i.e. IP routing and forwarding are available, then the MPLS-TP OAM toolset 
			MUST be able to operate by relying on the IP routing and forwarding capabilities.  
			All of the existing MPLS tools (i.e. LSP Ping, VCCV Ping, MPLS BFD, and VCCV BFD) 
			can support this functionality.  The Y.1731 toolset does not specifically support 
			this functionality, but rather relies on underlying technologies for forwarding 
			this could also be over IP, e.g. by using a VCCV extension.  Note that some of 
			the MPLS-TP tools such as Alarm Report are very transport oriented and may not 
			support IP functionality.
</li>
<li><a class='info' href='#MPLS-TP OAM Reqs'>[MPLS&#8209;TP OAM Reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vigoureux, M., Betts, M., and D. Ward, &ldquo;Requirements for OAM in MPLS Transport Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> requires that MPLS-TP OAM MUST be able 
            to operate without IP functionality and without relying on control 
            and/or management planes.  It is required that OAM functionality MUST 
            NOT be dependent on IP routing and forwarding capabilities. Except for the 
			LSP Ping operation of verifying the data-plane vs. the control-plane, the 
            existing tools do not rely on control and/or management plane, however 
            the following should be observed regarding the reliance on IP functionality:
</li>
<ul class="text">
<li>LSP Ping, VCCV Ping, and MPLS BFD makes use of IP header (UDP/IP) and do not 
			  completely comply with the requirement. In the on-demand mode, LSP Ping also 
              may use IP forwarding to reply back to the source router.  This dependence on 
              IP, has further implications concerning the use of LSP Ping as the 
              bootstrap mechanism for BFD for MPLS.  There are extensions to LSP-Ping that 
			  are under discussion that allow LSP-Ping to restrict replies to the
			  backside of a bidirectional LSP.
</li>
<li>VCCV BFD supports the use of  PW-ACH encapsulated  BFD sessions 
              for PWs and can comply with the requirement.
</li>
<li>Y.1731 PDU are technology agnostic and thereby not dependent on IP 
			  functionality.  These PDU could be carried by VCCV or G-ACH control channels.
</li>
</ul>
<li><a class='info' href='#MPLS-TP OAM Reqs'>[MPLS&#8209;TP OAM Reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vigoureux, M., Betts, M., and D. Ward, &ldquo;Requirements for OAM in MPLS Transport Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> requires that OAM tools for fault 
            management do not rely on user traffic, and the existing MPLS OAM 
            tools and Y.1731 already comply with this requirement. 
</li>
<li> It is also required that OAM packets and the user traffic are congruent (i.e.
            OAM packets are transmitted in-band) and there is a need to differentiate OAM 
            packets from user-plane ones. 
</li>
<ul class="text">
<li>For PWs, VCCV provides a control channel that can be associated with each 
                PW which allows sending OAM packets in band of PWs and allow the 
                receiving end-point to intercept, interpret, and process them 
                locally as OAM messages. VCCV defines different VCCV Connectivity 
                Verification Types for MPLS (like ICMP Ping, LSP Ping and IP/UDP 
                encapsulated BFD and PW-ACH encapsulated BFD).
</li>
<li>Currently there is no distinct OAM payload identifier in MPLS shim. BFD 
				and LSP Ping packets for LSPs are carried over UDP/IP and are addressed to 
				the loopback address range. The router at the end-point intercepts, interprets, 
				and processes the packets.  <a class='info' href='#MPLS G-ACH'>[MPLS G&#8209;ACH]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bocci, M., Bryant, S., and M. Vigoureux, &ldquo;MPLS Generic Associated Channel,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> generalizes the use

Architectural and Principles of Operation &ndash; Recommendations and Guidelines</h3>

<p>Based on the requirements analysis above, the following guidelines 
          should be followed to create an OAM environment that could more fully 
          support the requirements cited:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Define a generalized addressing scheme that can also support unique 
			 identification of the monitored paths (or connections).
</li>
<li>Use G-ACH for LSP and section levels.
</li>
<li>Define architectural element that is based on LSP hierarchy to apply 
			 the mechanisms to segments and concatenated segments.
</li>
<li>Apply BFD to these new mechanisms using the control channel 
             encapsulation, as defined above &ndash; allowing use of BFD for MPLS-TP 
             independent of IP functionality.  This could be used to address the CC-V 
			 functionality, described below.
</li>
<li>Similarly, LSP Ping could be extended to use only the LSP path (in both 
			 directions) without IP Forwarding.  Addressing for PW can be included by using
			 the VCCV mechanism.  LSP Ping could be used to address the CC-V, Route Tracing,
			 RDI, and Lock/Alarm Reporting functionality cited in the requirements.
</li>
<li>The Y.1731 PDU set could be used as a basis for defining the information units 
             to be transmitted over the G-ACH.  The actual procedures and addressing schemes would 
             need to be adjusted for the MPLS-TP environment.
</li>
<li>Define a mechanism that could be used to idnetify an intermediate point of a 
			 path in a unique way, to support the maintenance functions.  This addressing 
			 should be flexible to allow support for different addressing schemes, and would 
			 supplement the TTL exception mechanism to allow an OAM packet to be intercepted 
			 by intermediate nodes.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Creating these extensions/mechanisms would fulfill the following architectural
          requirements, mentioned above:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Independence of IP forwarding and routing, when needed.
</li>
<li>OAM packets should be transmitted in-band.
</li>
<li>Support a single OAM technology for LSP, PW, and Sections.
</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the following additional requirements can be satisfied:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Provide the ability to carry other types of communications (e.g., 
             APS, Management Control Channel (MCC), Signaling Control Channel 
             (SCC)), by defining new types of communication channels for PWs, Sections,
             and LSPs.
</li>
<li>The design of the OAM mechanisms for MPLS-TP MUST allow the 
             ability to support vendor specific and experimental OAM functions.
</li>

Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification</h3>

<p>Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification (CC-V) are OAM operations
          generally used in tandem, and compliment each other.  These functions may be
		  split into separate mechanisms.  Together they are used to detect loss of 
		  traffic continuity and misconnections between path end-points and are useful for 
		  applications like Fault Management, Performance Monitoring and Protection 
		  Switching, etc.  To guarantee that CC-V can identify misconnections from 
		  cross-connections it is necessary that the tool use network-wide unique 
		  identifiers for the path that is being checked in the session.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1.1"></a><h3>3.1.1.&nbsp;
Existing tools</h3>

<p>LSP Ping provides much of the functionality required for co-routed 
			bidirectional LSPs. As observed above, LSP Ping may be operated in both 
			asynchronous and on-demand mode.  Addressing is based on the full FEC identification 
			that provides a unique identifier, and the basic functionality only requires 
			support for the loopback address range in each node on the LSP path.
</p>
<p>BFD defines functionality that can be used to support the pro-active OAM CC-V 
            function when operated in the asynchronous mode.  However, the current definition 
            of basic BFD is dependent on use of LSP Ping to bootstrap the BFD session.  Regarding
            the connectivity functional aspects, basic BFD has a limitation that it uses only 
            locally unique (to each node) session identifiers.
</p>
<p>VCCV can be used to carry either LSP Ping or BFD packets that are not IP/UDP 
            encapsulated for CC-V on a PW. Note that PW termination/switching points use only 
			locally unique (to each node) labels. The PW label identifies the path uniquely 
			only at the LSP level.
</p>
<p>Y.1731 provides functionality for all aspects of CC-V for an Ethernet 
            environment, this could be translated for the MPLS-TP environment.  The CCM PDU 
            defined in <a class='info' href='#Y.1731'>[Y.1731]<span> (</span><span class='info'>International Telecommunications Union - Standardization, &ldquo;OAM functions and mechanisms for Ethernet based networks,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> includes the ability to set the frequency 
            of the messages that are transmitted, and provides for attaching the address of 
            the path (in the Ethernet case &ndash; the MEG Level) and a sequencing number to 
            verify that CCM messages were not dropped.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1.2"></a><h3>3.1.2.&nbsp;
Gap analysis</h3>

<p>LSP Ping could be used to cover the cases of co-routed bidirectional LSPs.  
			However, there is a certain amount of computational overhead involved with use 
			of LSP Ping (as was observed in sec 1.1), the verification of the control-plane, 
			and the need to support the loopback functionality at each intermediate node.
			LSP Ping uses a fully qualified LSP identifier, and when used in conjunction
			with VCCV would use the PW label to identify the transport path.  LSP Ping can 
			be extended to bypass the verification of the control plane
</p>
<p>BFD could be extended to fill the gaps indicated above.  The extension would include:

              </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>A mechanism should be defined to carry BFD packets over LSP without
                reliance on IP functionality.
</li>
<li>A mechanism should be defined to bootstrap BFD sessions for 
                MPLS that is not dependent on UDP.
</li>
<li>BFD needs to be used in conjunction with &quot;globally&quot; unique 
                identifiers for the path or ME being checked to allow connectivity 
                verfication support.  There are two possibilities, to allow BFD to support 
                this new type of identifier &ndash;
                  
<ul class="text">
<li>Change the semantics of the two Discriminator fields that exist in
                    BFD and have each node select the ME unique identifier.  This may have
                    backward compatibility implications.
</li>
<li>Create a new optional field in the packet carrying the BFD that would 
                    identify the path being checked, in addition to the existing session 
                    identifiers.
</li>
</ul>
                
</li>
<li>Extensions to BFD would be needed to cover P2MP connections.
</li>
</ul><p>
            
</p>
<p>Use of the Y.1731 functionality is another option that could be considered.  The 
            basic PDU for CCM includes (in the flags field) an indication of the frequency of the 
            packets [eliminating the need to "negotiate" the frequency between the end-points], 
            and also a flag used for RDI.  The procedure itself would need adaptation to comply 
            with the MPLS environment.
</p>
<p>An additional option would be to create a new tool that would give coverage
            for both aspects of CC-V according to the requirements and the principles of operation
            (see section 2.1).  This option is less preferable.

Packet Loss Measurement</h3>

<p>Packet Loss Measurement is a function that is used to verify the quality of
          the service.  This function indicates the ratio of packets that are not delivered 
          out of all packets that are transmitted by the path source.
</p>
<p>There are two possible ways of determining this measurement &ndash;
              </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Using OAM packets, it is possible to compute the statistics based on a 
                series of OAM packets.  This, however, has the disadvantage of being artificial,
                and may not be representative since part of the packet loss may be dependent 
                upon packet sizes.
</li>
<li>Sending delimiting messages for the start and end of a measurement period 
                during which the source and sink of the path count the packets transmitted and 
                received.  After the end delimiter, the ratio would be calculated by the path

<p>One possibility is to define a mechanism to support Packet Loss Measurement, based

            the ratio between received and transmitted packets.
</p>
<p>A second possibility would be to define a functionality based on the description 
            of the loss-measurement function defined in <a class='info' href='#Y.1731'>[Y.1731]<span> (</span><span class='info'>International Telecommunications Union - Standardization, &ldquo;OAM functions and mechanisms for Ethernet based networks,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> that is dependent

Packet Delay Measurement</h3>

<p>Packet Delay Measurement is a function that is used to measure one-way or 
          two-way delay of a packet transmission between a pair of the end-points of a 
		  path (PW, LSP, or Section). Where:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>One-way packet delay is the time elapsed from the start of 
            transmission of the first bit of the packet by a source node until the 
            reception of the last bit of that packet by the destination node.
</li>
<li>Two-way packet delay is the time elapsed from the start of transmission 
            of the first bit of the packet by a source node until the reception of 
            the last bit of the loop-backed packet by the same source node, when 
            the loopback is performed at the packet&#039;s destination node.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly to the packet loss measurement this could be performed in one of 
          two ways &ndash;
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Using OAM packets &ndash; checking delay (either one-way or two-way) in

Recommendations</h3>

<p>As indicated above, LSP-Ping could easily be extended to support some of the 
		functionality between the path end-points and between an end-point of a path and an 
		intermediate point. BFD could also be extended to support some of the functions 
		between the end-points of a path. Some of the OAM functions defined in 
		<a class='info' href='#Y.1731'>[Y.1731]<span> (</span><span class='info'>International Telecommunications Union - Standardization, &ldquo;OAM functions and mechanisms for Ethernet based networks,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> (especially for performance monitoring) could also be adapted.
</p>
<p>The guidelines that are used in this document are as follows:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Re-use/extend existing IETF protocols wherever applicable.
</li>
<li>Define new message format for each of the rest of the OAM functions, which 
		  are aligned with the ACH and ACH-TLV definitions, and includes only relevant 
		  information.
</li>
<li>Adapt Y.1731 functionality where applicable (mainly for performance monitoring).
</li>
</ul>
<p>The recommendations on the MPLS-TP OAM tools are as follows:
</p>
<p>
          </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Define a maintenance entity that could be applied both to LSPs and PWs that 
            would support management of a sub-path.  This entity should allow for  
            transmission of traffic by means of label stacking and proper TTL setting.
</li>
<li>Extend the control and the management planes to support the 
            configuration of the OAM maintenance entities and the set of functions 
            to be supported by these entities.
</li>
<li>Define a mechanism that would allow the unique addressing of the elements 
            that need to be monitored, e.g., the connections, end-points, and intermediate 
			points of a path.  This mechanism needs to be flexible enough to support 
			different addressing schemes, e.g. IP addresses, NSAP, connection names.  As 
			pointed out above, LSP Ping uses the full FEC identifier for the LSP - this 
			could easily be applied to Section OAM since this would be considered as a 
			stacked LSP.
</li>
<li>The appropriate assignment of network-wide unique identifiers for transport 
			paths, needed to support connectivity verification, should be considered.
</li>
<li>Extend existing MPLS tools to disengage from IP forwarding mechanisms.
</li>
<li>Extend BFD to support the proactive CC-V functionalities. The extensions should 
			address the gaps described above.
</li>
<li>Extend LSP Ping to support the on-demand Connectivity Verification functionality. 
			The extensions should address the gaps described above.
</li>
<li>Define a new PDU which will be transmitted over G-ACH to support the Alarm 
			Reporting functionality for data-plane implementations. Describe how Alarm 
			Reporting can be supported by a control-plane and by a management-plane.
</li>
<li>Define a new PDU which will be transmitted over G-ACH to support the Lock 
			Reporting functionality. Use the same procedures as for Alarm Reporting.
</li>
<li>Extend BFD to support the Remote Defect Indication (RDI) functionality. The 
			extensions should address the gaps described above.
</li>
<li>Extend LSP-Ping to support the Route tracing functionality. The extensions 
			should address the gaps described above.
</li>
<li>Extend LSP-Ping to support the Lock Instruct functionality between end-points 
			of a path. The extensions should address the gaps described above.
</li>
<li>Use PWE3 tool to transmit Client Fault Indication (CFI) via ACH. There are 
			already some proposals in the PWE3 WG.
</li>
<li>Define a new PDU which will be transmitted over G-ACH to support the Packet 
			Loss Measurement functionality. Base the functionality on the procedures defined 
			in Y.1731.
</li>
<li>Define a new PDU which be transmitted over G-ACH to support the Packet Delay 
			Measurement functionality. Base the functionality on the procedures defined in 
			Y.1731. For one-way delay measurement define mechanisms to ensure a certain degree 
			of synchronization between the time clocks of the two-ends of the transport path.
</li>
<li>Define a new PDU which be transmitted over G-ACH to support the Diagnostic 
			functionality.
</li>
<li>The tools may have the capability to authenticate the messages.  The information 
			may be carried in a G-ACH TLV.
