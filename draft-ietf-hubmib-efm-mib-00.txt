 Abstract
   
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. 
   This document proposes an extension to the Ethernet-like Interfaces
   MIB for the capability to manage Ethernet-in-the-First-Mile (EFM)
   devices.      
   
1  Introduction

   New capabilities have been added to Ethernet like interfaces within
   the IEEE P802.3ah project for Ethernet in the First Mile (EFM).  This
   memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for
   use with network management protocols in the Internet community to
   manage the new capabilities of EFM Ethernet interfaces.

2  The Internet-Standard Management Framework
   
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].  
   
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). 
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3  Overview
   
   Ethernet networks have evolved over time from an enterprise backbone
   to a variety of other applications.  The IEEE P802.3ah task force has
   defined extensions to the Ethernet standard for Ethernet deployments
   in the access space.  
   
   The Ethernet-in-the-First-Mile (EFM) task force has focused its
   efforts into four categories: optics, copper, Ethernet passive
   optical networks (Ethernet PON, or EPON), and operations,
   administration, and maintenance (OAM).   
   
   Generally, one can categorize the changes developed by IEEE P802.3ah
   as extending Ethernet with new physical layers (e.g. new optical
   physical layers, new copper physical layers, EPON), or as adding new
   common functionality applicable to many Ethernet physical layers
   (e.g. OAM).  
   
   This memo focuses on the management extensions to the MIB for
   Ethernet-like interfaces to address the new common Ethernet
   functionality developed in IEEE P802.3ah.  
   
   Two additional Ethernet MIB extensions are defined for IEEE P802.3ah. 
   The EFM Copper MIB [EFM-CU-MIB] and EFM P2MP MIB [EFM-P2MP-MIB]
   address the new physical layers introduced by IEEE P802.3ah.  
   
   EdNote: Might want to expand this more.

5  Mapping of IEEE 802.3ah Managed Objects
   
 
                                                              [Page 2]

   This section contains the mapping between managed objects defined in
   [802.3ah] Clause 30, and managed objects defined in this document.  
   
   EdNote: Add mapping table here.  
    
   
6  MIB Structure
   
   The common EFM MIB objects of this memo focus on the OAM capabilities
   introduced in IEEE P802.3ah.  The MIB objects are partitioned into
   four (4) different MIB groups.
   
   The dot3OamTable group manages the primary OAM objects of the
   Ethernet interface.  This group controls the state and status of OAM
   as well as the mode in which it operates.  
   The dot3OamStats table maintains statistics on the number and type of
   Ethernet OAM frames being transmitted and received on the Ethernet
   interface.
   
   The dot3OamPeer table maintains the current information on the status
   and configuration of the peer OAM entity on the Ethernet interface. 
   Managed information includes the capabilities and function available
   on the peer OAM entity.  
   
   The dot3OamEvent table defines the management objects for the event
   notification capability available in IEEE P802.3ah OAM.  With IEEE
   P802.3ah OAM, one device may send notifications to its peer devices
   whenever an important event happens on the local device.

             DESCRIPTION
                   "The MIB module for managing the new common Ethernet
                    features introduced by the Ethernet in the First
                    Mile task force (IEEE P802.3ah).  The functionality
                    presented here is based on IEEE P802.3ah/D3.0 
                    [802.3ah], released in December 2003.  
   
                    In particular, this MIB focused on the changes to 
                    Clause 30 of the draft that are not specific to any
                    physical layer.  These changes are primarily 
                    reflected in the new OAM features developed under 
                    this project, that can be applied to any Ethernet 
                    like interface. The
                    OAM features are described in Clause 57 of 
                    [802.3ah].

              STATUS      current
              DESCRIPTION "At initialization and failure conditions,
                           OAM entities on the same Ethernet link begin
                           a discovery phase to determine what OAM 
                           capabilities maybe used on that link.  The 
                           progress of this initialization is controlled
                           by the OAM sublayer.  This value is always
                           'disabled' if OAM is disabled via the 
                           dot3OamAdminState.  
                           
                           The 'passiveWait' state is returned
                           only by OAM entities in passive mode
                           (dot3OamMode) and reflects the state in which
                           the OAM entity is waiting to see if the peer
                           device is OAM capable.  The 'activeSendLocal'
                           is used by active mode devices (dot3OamMode) 
                           and reflects the OAM entity actively trying 
                           to discover whether the peer has OAM ability
                           but has not yet made that determination.  
                           
                           The state 'sendLocalAndRemote1' reflects that
                           the local OAM entity has discovered the peer 
                           but has not yet accepted or rejected the 
                           configuration of the peer.  The local device 
                           can, for whatever reason, decide that the

                           peering.  If the local OAM entity rejects the

8  Security Considerations
   
   The readable objects in this module can provide information about
   network traffic, and therefore may be considered sensitive.  In
   particular, OAM provides mechanisms for reading the IEEE 802.3 Clause
   30 MIB attributes from a link partner via a specialized layer two
   protocol.  Unlike SNMP, IEEE P802.3ah OAM does not include encryption
   or authorization mechanisms.  It should be used in environments where
   either this interface information is not considered sensitive, or
   where the facility terminations are protected.  
   
   IEEE P802.3ah OAM is designed to support deployment in access and
   enterprise networks.  In access networks, one end of a link is the
   CO-side, and the other is the CPE-side, and the facilities are often
   protected in wiring cages or closets.  In such deployments, it is
   often the case that the CO-side is protected from access from the CPE
   side.  Within IEEE P802.3ah OAM, this protection from remote access
   is accomplished by configuring the CPE-side in passive mode using the
   dot3OamMode attribute.  This prevents the CPE from accessing
   functions and information at the CO-side of the connection.  In

 
                                                             [Page 25] 
                   draft-ietf-hubmib-efm-mib-00.txt      February 2004


   enterprise networks, read-only interface information is often
   considered non-sensitive.  
   
   The operation of OAM on an Ethernet interface does not adversely
   affect data traffic as OAM is a slow protocol with very limited
   bandwidth potential, and it is not required for normal link
   operation.  And although there are a number of objects in this module
   with read-write or read-create MAX-ACCESS, they only affect the
   operation of the OAM protocol itself and not user data traffic.  
   
   The loopback capability of OAM can have potentially disruptive
   effects in that the when enabling remote loopback, the remote station
   automatically transmits all received traffic back to the local
   station except for OAM traffic.  This completely disrupts all higher
   layer protocols such as bridging, IP, and SNMP.  
   
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even   
   if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even   
   then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed   
   to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this   
   MIB module.
   
   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).
   
   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them
