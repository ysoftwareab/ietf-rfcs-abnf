Abstract

  This memo specifies a protocol for transferring invoices automatically
  between companies. The receiver can read invoice data automatically
  into accounts payables and possibly into approval work flow. This
  eliminates the costly and error-prone manual typing of invoice data.
  Main design goal was simplicity in order to make implementation easy.
  The parties involved identify themselves using e-mail addresses, which
  makes addressing simple and flexible.

1. INTRODUCTION

  This protocol is intended to allow sending invoices automatically
  from invoicing systems to accounts payables and approval work flow
  systems.

  The design goals of the Simple Invoicing Protocol (SINV) are:

  - Simplicity and ease of implementation and use
  - Unambiguous protocol
  - The receiver can read all essential information automatically into
    their systems
  - Peer-to-peer protocol, no hubs or exchanges needed
  - SPAM protection
  - Invoices can even be sent by typing them manually

  Invoices are sent as e-mail messages. Both the receiver and sender
  must have an e-mail address. The receiving mailbox must be dedicated
  to handle only SINV messages.

2. BASIC PRINCIPLE

  First the invoice sender must send a PARTNER message which contains
  basic information of the sender. The receiver must check the
  information manually and create an account for the sender - either
  manually or (semi)automatically. The receiver must reply to the sender
  when the account was created or if the registration is rejected.

  Registered senders can then send INVOICE messages. The receiver MUST
  reply to an INVOICE message whether it was successfully parsed and
  invoice processing in the receiving organization has been started.
  The receiver SHOULD inform the sender when the invoice is paid or if
  there are problems.

3. MODIFICATIONS NEEDED FOR EXISTING SYSTEMS

  The sender must modify the invoicing system to send PARTNER and
  INVOICE messages via e-mail.

  The receiver must dedicate a mailbox for incoming invoices. The
  receiver needs a program which can read the mailbox (via POP3 or IMAP
  for example) and parse the PARTNER and INVOICE messages. For each
  PARTNER message a work flow for a new account must be started. For
  each INVOICE message a work flow for approving a purchase invoice must
  be started.

4. MESSAGE SYNTAX

  A message contains elements. An element contains a tag which begins
  with a period, such as .INVOICE. All tags are in UPPER CASE.

  An element may contain a value. The value might be only one line, in
  which case in can be typed after the tag, separated by white space.
  If the value contains many lines, the lines can be typed after the
  tag. The value MUST NOT contain a line which begins with a dot.

  All dates are represented as YYYYMMDD. All numbers are represented as
  digits with a leading sign, digits, decimal point (dot) and
  digits. The sign and decimal part (the dot and digits) are optional.

7. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

  This protocol is intended to replace paper invoices. Paper invoices
  do not provide for authentication nor encryption, so these features
  are not considered to be mandatory here. The main benefit of SINV
  is that invoices can be read automatically to receiver's systems
  - and this is so important that possible risks caused by missing
  authentication should not prevent using SINV.

  The mailbox used for receiving invoices should be read only by the
  program which parses SINV messages. This program MUST be built so
  that it can handle messages with syntax errors, such as SPAM,
  viruses and possible buffer overflow attacks.
