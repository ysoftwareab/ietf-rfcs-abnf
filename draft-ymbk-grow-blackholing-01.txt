                BLACKHOLE BGP Community for Blackholing
                     draft-ymbk-grow-blackholing-01

Abstract

   This document describes the use of a well-known Border Gateway
   Protocol (BGP) community for blackholing at IP networks and Internet
   Exchange Points (IXP).  This well-known advisory transitive BGP
   community, namely BLACKHOLE, allows an origin AS to specify that a
   neighboring IP network or IXP should blackhole a specific IP prefix.

1.  Introduction

   The network infrastructure has been getting hammered by DDoS attacks
   for years.  In order to block DDoS attacks, IP networks have offered
   BGP blackholing to neighboring networks (iBGP scenarios [RFC3882] and
   RTBH filtering [RFC5635]), much like some IXPs have recently started
   to do.

   DDoS attacks targeting a certain IP network may cause congestion of
   links used to connect to other networks.  In order to limit the
   impact of such a scenario on legitimate traffic, IP networks and IXPs
   adopted a mechanism called BGP blackholing.  A network that wants to
   trigger blackholing needs to understand the triggering mechanism
   adopted by its neighboring IP networks and IXPs.  Different IP
   networks and IXPs provide different BGP mechanism to trigger

Internet-Draft   BLACKHOLE BGP Community for Blackholing       July 2015


   blackholing including pre-defined blackhole next- hop IP addresses
   and pre-defined BGP communities.

   Having several different mechanisms to trigger blackholing at
   different IP networks and IXPs makes it an unnecessarily complex,
   error-prone and cumbersome task for network operators.  Therefore a
   well-known BGP community [RFC1997] is defined for operational ease.

   Having such a well-known BGP community for blackholing also supports
   IP networks and IXPs as

   o  implementing and monitoring blackholing gets easier if
      implementation and operational guides do not cover many options to
      trigger blackholing
   o  the amount of support requests from customers about how to trigger
      blackholing at a particular IP network or IXP will be reduced as
      the mechanism is unified

   Making it considerably easier for network operators to utilize
   blackholing makes operations easier.

2.  BLACKHOLE Attribute

   This document defines the use a new well-known BGP transitive
   community, BLACKHOLE.

   The semantics of this attribute is to allow a network to interpret
   the presence of this community as an advisory qualification to drop
   any traffic being sent towards this prefix.

3.  Operational Recommendations

3.1.  IP Prefix Announcements with BLACKHOLE Community Attached

   When an IP network is under DDoS duress, it MAY announce an IP prefix
   covering the victim's IP address(es) for the purpose of signaling to
   neighboring IP networks or IXPs that any traffic destinated for these
   IP address(es) should be discarded.  In such a scenario, the network
   operator SHOULD attach BLACKHOLE BGP community.

3.2.  Local Scope of Blackholes

   A BGP speaker receiving a BGP announcement tagged with the BLACKHOLE
   BGP community SHOULD add a NO_ADVERTISE, NO_EXPORT or similar
   communities to prevent propagation of this route outside the local
   AS.

   Unintentional leaking of more specific IP prefixes to neighboring
   networks can have adverse effects.  Extreme caution should be used
   when purposefully propagating IP prefixes tagged with the BLACKHOLE
   BGP community outside the local routing domain.

3.3.  Accepting Blackholed IP Prefixes

   It has been observed announcements of IP prefixes larger than /24 for
   IPv4 and /48 for IPv6 are usually not accepted on the Internet (see
   section 6.1.3 [RFC7454]).  However, blackhole routes should be as
   small as possible in order to limit the impact of discarding traffic
   for adjacent IP space that is not under DDoS duress.  Typically, the
   blackhole route's prefix length is as specific as /32 for IPv4 and
   /128 for IPv6.

   BGP speakers SHOULD only accept and honor BGP announcements carrying
   the BLACKHOLE community if the announced prefix is covered by a
   shorter prefix for which the neighboring network is authorized to
   advertise.

3.4.  IXPs: Peering at Route Servers

   Many IXPs provide the so-called policy control feature as part of
   their route servers [I-D.ietf-idr-ix-bgp-route-server] (see e.g. the
   LINX website [1]).  Policy control allows members to specify by using
   BGP communities which ASNs connected to the route server receive a
   particular BGP announcement.

   Combined usage of the BGP communities for blackholing and policy
   control allows a fine-grained control of a blackhole.

   In some implementations of blackholing at IXPs, the route server
   after receiving a BGP announcement tagged with the BLACKHOLE BGP
   community rewrites the next-hop IP address to the pre-defined
   blackholing IP address before redistributing the announcement.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to register BLACKHOLE as a well-known BGP
   community with global significance:

      BLACKHOLE (= 0xFFFF029A)

   The low-order two octets in decimal are 666, amongst IP network
   operators a value commonly associated with BGP blackholing.

5.  Security Considerations

   BGP contains no specific mechanism to prevent the unauthorized
   modification of information by the forwarding agent.  This allows
   routing information to be modified, removed, or false information to
   be added by forwarding agents.  Recipients of routing information are
   not able to detect this modification.  Also, RPKI [RFC6810] and
   BGPSec [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-overview] do not fully resolve this
   situation.  For instance, BGP communities can still be added or
   altered by a forwarding agent even if RPKI and BGPSec are in place.

   The BLACKHOLE BGP community does not alter this situation.

   A new additional attack vector is introduced into BGP by using the
   BLACKHOLE BGP community: denial of service attacks for IP prefixes.

   Unauthorized addition of the BLACKHOLE BGP community to an IP prefix
   by a forwarding agent may cause a denial of service attack based on
   denial of reachability.  The denial of service will happen if an IP
   network or IXP offering blackholing is traversed.  However, denial of
   service attack vectors to BGP are not new as the injection of false
   routing information is already possible.

   In order to further limit the impact of unauthorized BGP
   announcements carrying the BLACKHOLE BGP community the receiving BGP
   speaker SHOULD verify by applying strict filtering (see section
   6.2.1.1.2.  [RFC7454]) that the peer announcing the prefix is
   authorized to do so.  If not, the BGP announcement should be filtered
   out.

   The presence of this BLACKHOLE BGP community may introduce a resource
   exhaustion attack to BGP speakers.  If a BGP speaker receives many IP
   prefixes containing the BLACKHOLE BGP community its internal
   resources such as CPU power and/or memory might get consumed,
   especially if usual prefix sanity checks (e.g. such as IP prefix
   length or number of prefixes) are disabled (see Section 3.3).
