Internet-Draft              3GPP Reqs for IM                October 2002


1. Introduction

   This document lists the requirements for instant messaging based on
   3GPP specifications and the special characteristics of a wireless
   environment.  The requirements presented in this document complement
   the requirements in [1], and relate to already ongoing work in the
   SIMPLE WG.  These requirements are proposed to be evaluated by the
   working group, and incorporated in the relevant work items.

1.1 System Overview

   Within the 3GPP IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) Messaging work, two
   types of messaging services [4] have been identified:

   Immediate Messaging
      A sender expects near real time message delivery.  Typically, the
      sender is aware of the availability of the recipient a priori,
      possibly through the use of the presence service.

   Session Based Messaging
      A sender and a recipient have to join a messaging session before
      messages can be exchanged as part of the session.  The
      participants of the session expect near real time delivery of
      messages.  Mainly, the intended application for session based
      messaging are multiparty messaging sessions, i.e., chat rooms,
      where a group of participants exhange instant messages with each
      others.

   Both of these two messaging service types have properties which make
   the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [5] very suitable for
   addressing their requirements.  Hence, the charter items in the
   SIMPLE working group for defining instant messaging and message
   sessions using SIP are considered as targets for the requirements
   presented in this memo.

      Note that some of the requirements herein may be more related to
      the data manipulation requirements of SIMPLE systems [6], and the
      SIP conferencing requirements [7] work in the SIPPING WG.


1.2 Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [2].

   In this document, terms "immediate messaging" and "instant messaging"
   are interchangeable.  Also, "message sessions" are used in place of

Internet-Draft              3GPP Reqs for IM                October 2002


   "session based messaging" to better align the terminology used in the
   3GPP and IETF.

      Note that the term "session based messaging" used by the 3GPP IMS
      messaging often includes the notion of a multiparty message
      session, which includes both conferencing and message sessions as
      components.


2. General Characteristics of Wireless Systems

   The radio interface of wireless systems is often a scarce resource.
   As such, the message exchange over the radio interface should be
   efficiently compact and kept to a minimum.  All the mechanisms
   developed should make efficient use of the radio interface.

   As terminals can be rather small devices, the memory and power
   consumption requirements, requirements for processing power, and for
   screen size and rendering capabilities should be kept to a minimum.
   Mandating support for additional protocols and mechanisms in the
   wireless terminal must meet these criteria.

3. Requirements

   This section lists the requirements for Instant Messaging in the 3GPP
   IMS wireless environment.  Generally, these protocol requirements
   stem from the special characteristics of wireless systems, and the
   specific set of capabilities specified by the 3GPP.  More information
   on these aspects can be found in 3GPP TS 23.228 [8].

3.1 Addressing Requirements

   It MUST be possible to use a single address to identify the recipient
   or sender of an instant message or a member in a message session,
   irrespective of the messaging system.

   Use of E.164 numbers [3] in addressing instant messages and message
   session requests MUST be supported.

3.2 Message Content Requirements

   It MUST be possible to carry any MIME encoded data in Instant
   Messages and message sessions.  The content size MUST NOT be limited
   by the Instant Messaging, or message session protocols.

   Additionally, it MUST be possible to send the entire message body, or
   parts of the body in a way that allows the recipient to choose
   between receivçng the body and ignoring it.

Internet-Draft              3GPP Reqs for IM                October 2002


   Messages MUST be able to carry multiple MIME objects, and sequencing
   of media MUST be supported.

      OPEN ISSUE: The sequencing requirement is somewhat unclear.

   It MUST be possible for the UA to announce its callee capabilities
   for messaging.  Similarly, it MUST also be possible to base handling
   of instant messages on these user capabilities and preferences.

3.3 Data Manipulation and Management Requirements

   It MUST be possible to create new Address-of-Records (AOR) for
   message session based conferences, i.e., chat rooms.  These AORs are
   either ad-hoc style for short lived conferences, or persistent, if
   the identification of a conference focus is long lived.  There MUST
   be a standardized mechanism by which such ad-hoc or persistent AORs
   can be created, applied, and discarded by the user.

   It MUST be possible for an administrator (or any user with
   appropriate access rights) of a chat room to control the list of
   allowed participants.  There MUST be a standardized mechanism by
   which such authorization policy is inserted, manipulated and removed.

   There MUST be a standard mechanism for an end device to learn the
   address of the data manipulation interface used for performing the
   aforementioned control functions of a chat room.

   There MUST be standardized mechanisms by which an administrator (or
   any user with appropriate access rights) of a chat room can invite
   new participants to the chat room, and kick out existing
   participants.

   It MUST be possible for the administrator of a chat room to set the
   properties of a chat room, e.g., name, topic, and maximum number of
   participants.  There MUST be a standardized mechanism by which such
   properties are set, manipulated, and removed.

3.4 Message Delivery and Handling Requirements

   It MUST be possible to divert or block instant messages as part of a
   user configurable option.  Such mechanisms MUST support instant
   message diversion based on sender address, message size, message
   priority, message subject, message class and message content type.
   The mechanism MAY support instant message diversion based on other
   message properties.

   It MUST be possible for the sender of an instant message to receive
   either positive or negative acknowledgements of delivery for all sent

Internet-Draft              3GPP Reqs for IM                October 2002


   messages.

3.5 User Privacy Requirements

   It MUST be possible for a recipient of an instant message or a
   message session to see the identity of the originator, unless the
   originator is anonymous or its address is hidden.

   It MUST be possible to originate anonymous instant messages and
   message sessions.  It MUST be possible to originate instant messages
   and message sessions using pseudonyms, or nicknames.

   It MUST be possible to send private messages between the participants
   of a multiparty message session.  It MUST be possible to send private
   messages to participants who are using pseudonym identities or
   nicknames.  Also, it MUST be possible to send private messages using
   a nickname or an anonymous identity.  A private message MUST be
   delivered in the context of the ongoing multiparty message session,
   and messages intended for private consumption MUST NOT be delivered
   to other than the intended recipient.

4. Charging Requirements

   This document refers to the charging requirements of [1], and does
   not list any additional charging requirements at this time.

5. Security Requirements

   This document adopts the security requirements listed in [1], and
   does not introduce any additional security requirements at this time.

6. Proposal for Next Steps

   It is proposed that the SIMPLE Working Group evaluates the
   requirements presented in this document and incorporates the relevant
   ones in its current work items.  Those requirements possibly falling
   out of the scope of the SIMPLE WG should find a more suitable home,
   possibly also in other standardization bodies.
