Abstract

   This document IANA registers XML elements of interior locations 
   <INT> in a common TLV format.

Internet-Draft     IANA Reg. <INT> elements in TLV         October 2009


   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC 2119].


1.  Introduction  

   The Presence Information Data Format - Location Object (PIDF-LO) 
   [RFC4119], defines an XML scheme for geolocation in civic form.  
   Building interior elements were  created and defined in 
   [ID-GEO-INT], within the <INT> element.  This <INT> element was 
   extended in [ID-INT-EXT] which identifies 17 internal identifiers 
   providing relative position information, including shape boundary 
   information.  One specific goal included in this work is to create a
   binary representation of the civic location elements, analogous to 
   the TLV format utilized in RFC4776 [RFC4776] and RFC5139 [RFC5139], 
   from PIDF-LO for use in non-XML protocols.

   This latter part was motivated by the IEEE having formally 
   requested, via a proper liaison seen (here [IEEE-LIAISON]), the 
   Internet Engineering Task Force define a binary payload for 
   communicating interior location XML elements of a Presence 
   Information Data Format - Location Object (PIDF-LO), defined in RFC 
   4119 [RFC4119].  

   This document IANA registers these interior location XML elements in
   a common TLV (Type/Length/Value) format which originated in 
   [ID-INT-EXT].  

   The IETF is a logical place to maintain this definition, as the IETF
   is the creator of the XML namespaces that defined the civic location
   elements of PIDF-LO, as well as being the creator and owner of the 
   civic datum in TLV format [RFC4776].  


2. Interior Location Types

   The Interior Location Types (LocType) defined in [ID-INT-EXT] work 
   in conjunction with the TLV format defined in RFC4776 and RFC5139.  
   To accommodate possible future needs, the CAtype field utilized in 
   [RFC4776 & RFC5139] sequences to value 39.  The LocType defined here
   start at value 201, under the idea that if these types ever get 
   merged with the CAtype table, having no collisions from the start 
   would be a good thing.  We call the fields 'LocTypes' because they 
   are not civic addressing in the traditional sense.  For all intents 
   and purposes, CAtypes MUST be treated as if they were LocTypes, and 
   visa-versa.

   The classic TLV format is shown here, in Figure 1.

   Figure 1. Classic TLV format for Location

   For location types of 'point', 'circle', 'arcband', and 'polygon', 
   no value is expected, and is ignored; as these TLVs are only for 
   identifying the shape of the relative location position.

   The range of LocTypes for interior locations is limited from 

      201 to 254.

   For positive Locvalues, the character '+' is not mandatory, but is 
   RECOMMENDED for consistent readability.  The above table shows a ' 
   single quote character; this is not expected to be present in on the
   wire.


3.  Security considerations

   There are no security considerations outside of those explored in 
   RFC 4776 and RFC 5139.


4.  IANA considerations

   This document IANA registers the following values in a new 'Interior
   Location Types' (LocTypes) table, with this document as the 
   reference.
