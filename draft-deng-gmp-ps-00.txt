Abstract

   This document discusses the problem and requirement of the
   communication protocol between mobile access point and terminal.
   With the evolution of mobile communication, there are various kind of
   wireless communication technologies such as GSM, GPRS, WCDMA, LTE,
   WLAN, WiMAX, and TDS-CDMA et al.  Each of these wireless
   communication has independent connection, mobility and configuration
   management.  This document would like converge all these function
   into a common ground especially in the environment of multiple
   connections.

1.  Introduction

   In the current wireless communication network, there are various
   kinds of selection around our environment, even in one mobile
   operator, there are several choices for subscriber to choose.  It
   become obvious that mutiple connections have to be supported by
   mobile terminals.

   Current each individual wireless communication has independent
   connection commands and triggers, as well as mobility management and
   configuration. for example, 802.11 specifiy "Associate/Deassociate/
   Reassociate", GSM specify "Channel Request", WCDMA/LTE/TDS-CDMA
   specify "RRC setup/release", and Wimax specify "MAC Ranging" et al.

   Mobile terminal normally use each specific interface to control its
   connection, mobility management and configurations et al.  Terminal
   software have to study each interface characteristics.  This
   phenomena become more serious after the request of terminal for
   multiple connections comes.

   There were some proposals to extend link layer to make a common
   ground for this operation, but it will cost to revise some chipset or
   kernel level.  This make it hard to realize.  But solution such as
   more high level interface and independent on link layer may meet the
   requirement.  And it will be quite convenient for the mobile opreator
   to handle if the connection, mobility, and configuration management
   will be based on a common protocol which don't rely on link layer
   technology.

2.  Multiple Network Connections

   multiple Network Connection has become obvious requirement for
   wireless data communications.  Operator may think about efficient
   using radio resource. subscriber may think about different price for
   different connections.  Some connections may be flat rate based,
   others may be transmitted packet based.  Or some connection has
   better Quality of Service or no traffic filter exist.

   The multiple network connections for mobile terminal is shown in the
   figure below:

                x            y            v            z            xi
                |            |            |            |            |
          +-----+      +-----+      +-----+      +-----+      +-----+
          | MAR |......| MAR |......| MAR |......| MAR |......| MAR |
          +-----+      +-----+      +-----+      +-----+      +-----+
                `.        :           ,'  `.          :           ,'
                 `.       :         ,'     `.         :         ,'
                  `.      :       ,'        `.        :       ,'
                   `.     :     ,'            `.      :     ,'
                    v     v    v                v     v    v
                    |     |    |                |     |    |
                    +----------+     Move       +----------+
                    | Terminal |  ==========>   | Terminal |
                    +----------+                +----------+

   When Terminal move around in the wireless environment, it may change
   multiple connections timely.Let's make a example for above figure,
   radio x and xi are the same type wireless link like LTE, and radio v
   is always connected like Wimax, radio y is WLAN and radio z is TDS-
   CDMA. when terminal make a movement, wireless connections will also
   changes, the routing and mobility management would better change
   accordingly.

2.1.  Service requirement

   Different service may act independently when terminal has multiple
   connections.  From the service provider point of view, they don't
   mandate that the application must handover to the second interface
   when it just start up.  Some of service may keep orginal connection,
   and others may handover to the second interface.  This kind of
   handover could happen both initiated by network or terminal itself.

2.2.  Routing issue for terminal

   Current most default routing of the operating system will take the
   last connection after the second interface is up.  This is the basic

3.  Reference Model

   Assuming the name of protocol between terminal and access point is
   GMP (Generic Mobility Protocol) which would work in the various kind
   of wireless connections such as GSM, GPRS, WCDMA, LTE, WiFi, and TDS-
   CDMA et al.  After the coding of each command for connections,
   mobility, and configuration, network or terminal could control each
   connection and mobility management based on a common language like
   the figure below.

                  +------+------+------+------+------+-------+
                  |              GMP Protocol                |
                  +------+------+------+------+------+-------+
                  |       GMP Interface and Payload          |
                  +------+------+------+------+------+-------+
                  | Various Kinds of MAC layer and Protocol  |
                  +------+------+------+------+------+-------+
                  |GSM   | GPRS |WCDMA | LTE  | WiFi |TDSCDMA|
                  +------+------+------+------+------+-------+

   Each wireless technology essentially have independent control command
   and protocol, but that will not really interfer with configuration
   and mobility management until GMP based command come.  This is
   specially happen when network or terminal would like to have new
   interface connectioned or make happen for a mobility event

4.  Security Considerations

   The protocol between terminal and wireless access point could be
   protected by wirless protection mechanism since most of wireless
   communication is based on P2P connections, in the case of shared link
   wireless connection, layer 2 or layer 3 based seucrity mechanism
   should be adopted.
