Abstract

This document provides a working definition of ôabsolute scalabilityö and ôweak 
scalabilityö of a method of an ad hoc network, and also a way of comparing the 
scalability of two different methods.  A method may be a protocol, an algorithm,
or a scheme whose scalability needs to be evaluated.  For example, it may be a 
routing protocol or a MAC protocol.  ôAbsolute scalabilityö emphasizes the 
asymptotic behavior of a set of metrics, which define the efficiency of the 
network as a network parameter tends to infinity.  ôWeak scalabilityö refers 
to the comparison of the metrics over a given range.  Finally, fairness in the 
comparison of these metrics is discussed.


1. Introduction

The current focus of the IRTF MANET WG is the investigation of scalability 
techniques, in order to develop standards for large-scale ad hoc networks.  The 
scalability of a method in an ad hoc network is a measure of its ability to 
maintain efficiency, as some parameters of the network increase to very large 
values.  Many metrics contribute to the determination of scalability of a method 
with respect to a given parameter in a particular environment.  For this reason, 
we say that a method is scalable with respect to a [parameter, metric, environment] 
triple.  For example, a method may be scalable with respect to [number of nodes, 
required storage at each node, only single-hop communications].  It is also 
possible to define the relative scalability of one method compared to another.

ABSOLUTE SCALABILITY involves asymptotic results, in which the efficiency does 
not vanish as a chosen parameter approaches infinity.  WEAK SCALABILITY considers 
the effectiveness of the method within a finite range.  Weak scalability may be 
of interest, since it could be impossible for a parameter to exceed some value.  
For example, the arrivals of packets into the network may be physically limited 
to some maximum rate.  In this case, the scalability over a finite range may be 
a more applicable measure than asymptotic results.

Scalability is particularly important in the emerging field of sensor networks.  
These networks can potentially consist of millions of very small nodes, which 
communicate wirelessly among themselves.  As the number of nodes increases, one 
must determine whether the degradation in system performance can be tolerated.  
Gupta and Kumar show in [1] that such a system may not be feasible; i.e., the 
maximum achievable per node end-to-end throughput, L, decays to zero as the 
number of nodes in the network, N, becomes increasingly large.  This work is 
one of the most challenging theoretical results on scalability. 

[1] analyzes the scaling of L with respect to N via two network models.  In the 
first network model, the arbitrary network model, there are no restrictions on 
the locations of the N nodes in the network domain, which is a circular disk of 
area 1 meter^2.  Each node is capable of maintaining at most one omnidirectional 
transmission or reception at any time.  There are no restrictions on the choice 
of transmission powers, routing protocol, or spatial-temporal transmission 
scheduling policy.  The second network model is the random network model, in 
which the node locations are uniformly distributed, the traffic pattern is 
random and the fixed transmission power is adjusted to ensure connectivity of 
the network as N becomes large.

Under the collision based reception model, [1] concludes that L is O(1/N^0.5) 
for arbitrary networks, and O(1/[Nlog(N)]^0.5) for random networks.  [1] also 
finds scaling laws using a more realistic Signal-To-Interference-and-Noise 
Ratio (SINR) threshold-based model by assuming that the path loss exponent, 
g, exceeds 2.  With the SINR threshold-based model, [1] concludes that L is 
O(1/N^(1/g)) for arbitrary networks and O(1/N^(0.5)) for random networks.

In [2], Grossglauser and Tse conclude that the situation is more optimistic 
if the nodes are mobile instead of static as in [1].  In addition to the random 
network model and the SINR threshold-based model, [2] assumes also that nodesÆ 
locations form a stationary ergodic process with a uniform distribution in the 
network domain, that source-destination pairs never change, and that very long 
end-to-end delays are tolerable.  [2] concludes that there exists a routing and 
scheduling policy that delivers a packet to its destination with no more than 
two hops and allows L to stay above a positive constant while N goes to infinity.  
Above all, both [1] and [2] claim that the maximum number of simultaneously 
successful transmissions in a wireless network, Nt_max, is on the order of N; 
i.e., Theta(N).

More recently, in [3], it was proven that L is O(1/N) even when the mobility 
pattern of the nodes, the spatial-temporal transmission scheduling policy, the 
temporal variation of transmission powers, the source-destination pairs, and 
the possibly multi-path routes between them are all optimally chosen.  This 
result continues to hold even when the nodes are capable of maintaining 
multiple transmissions and/or receptions simultaneously.  In contrast with 
[1] and [2], it was also shown that Nt_max has an upper bound that does not 
depend on N.  This upper bound is the transmission capacity of the network 
domain, Nt_Q.  For a circular network domain of area A, it has been demonstrated 
that Nt_Q is O(A^min{g/2,1}) if g?2 and O(A/log(A)) if g=2.  In addition, Nt_Q 
is O(g^2), and for processing gain G and threshold reception SINR b, Nt_Q 
is O(G/b).  Regarding scalability of practical systems, it was shown that a 
desired per node end-to-end throughput is not achievable as N tends to infinity, 
unless the following conditions apply: average number of hops between a source 
and a destination does not exceed a constant (i.e., Theta(1)), the area A grows 
with N, and N is O(A^min{g/2,1}) if g?2 and O(A/log(A)) if g=2.

On the other hand, there have also been works on scalability, which focus on the 
implementation of a routing scheme that offers satisfactory performance as N 
increases [5-9].  To assess how satisfactorily their proposed schemes perform, 
each of these works developed its own set of metrics such as packet delivery 
ratio, throughput, end-to-end delay, routing overhead, average path length, or 
storage requirements.  Based on these metrics, and usually through the use of 
simulation tools, these works compared the scalability of their schemes with 
others while increasing N.  The main limitation of these works is the subjective 
choice of the metrics and other parameters used in the simulations.  For example, 
some researchers observe that their scheme offers lower control overhead compared 
to some other schemes, up to a certain number of nodes, thus they claim their 
scheme is scalable. Other researchers reach the same conclusion about their own 
respective schemes by using different metrics and different number of nodes.  
This problem was realized by Santivanez et al. in [4].  This paper was the first 
step towards developing a more objective and theoretical framework for analyzing 
scalability of wireless networks.  [4] defines a network as scalable with respect 
to a parameter if the offered load to the network does not exceed the maximum load 
that the network can support under optimal conditions (ideal scheduling, ideal 
routing, no overhead, etc.) as the parameter approaches infinity.  [4] also defines 
a routing protocol as scalable if as the parameter approaches infinity, the total 
overhead of the routing protocol does not exceed the traffic load of the network 
under optimal conditions.  Moreover, [4] provides an approach for scalability 
comparison of two routing protocols by comparing the growth rates of their overheads 
with respect to a given parameter.  The main contribution of the paper was the idea 
of developing an analytical approach to evaluate scalability, rather than the use of 
simulations.  Some of the restrictions of this work include: (1) focusing on the 
routing aspect of the problem, (2) comparing/evaluating scalability using routing 
overhead exclusively, and (3) choosing a specific set of environmental parameters.

In the following sections, we propose a general framework to analyze scalability 
of wireless networks.


2. Definitions

We define INDEPENDENT PARAMETERS as parameters that can be freely varied, and the 
PRIMARY METRICS as quantities that are observed in the network.  We also define 
ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETERS as parameters that define the operational conditions of 
the network.  The following are non-exhaustive lists of these attributes and 
descriptions of their roles in the network.  Though the lists focus primarily on 
routing protocols, the scalability of other methods follows the same process.

2.1 Independent parameters

Methods are termed scalable with respect to certain parameters, as the parameters 
approach infinity.  These parameters are aspects of the network that an evaluator 
of a method has the ability to change.  Some of such possible parameters, 
applicable to different types of methods, are listed below:

- Number of nodes 
- Node density
- Traffic load
- Mobility
- 1/(Physical size of nodes)
- Accuracy [of the results of an algorithm]

2.2 Primary metrics

PRIMARY METRICS of the system are the dependent variables that are observed as 
the network is scaled with respect to an independent parameter.  Before using 
any of these metrics for testing, they must be well defined.  Possible specific 
definitions of the metrics are provided below.  Since, most often, for a particular 
evaluation, an evaluator will choose more than one primary metric, the primary 
metrics are arranged in a SCALABILITY VECTOR.  In general, scalability of 
individual metrics is insufficient to consider, but rather the scalability of 
all of the components in the vector must be simultaneously considered.  Examination 
of the scalability vector can be indicative of which method (such as an algorithm 
or a protocol) is most appropriate for a given application.  

- (1/throughput) of the network 
     * Hop-by-hop throughput of a flow (includes packets which may be eventually 
	dropped)
     * End-to-end throughput of a flow (does not include dropped packets)
     * Throughput of the entire network
     * Minimum throughput over all flows
     * Average throughput over all flows

- Delay in the network
     * Maximum or average hop-by-hop delay
     * Maximum or average end-to-end delay

- Battery power required at the network nodes

- Memory/storage required at the network nodes

- Processing power required at the network nodes

- 1/(network lifetime)
     * Network dies when one of the nodes dies
     * Network dies when certain fraction of the nodes dies
     * Network dies when all of the nodes die
     * Network dies when the maximum number of possible connections decreases 
	below a threshold value


The complete set of primary metrics and their definitions may depend on the 
application; however this minimal set of primary metrics should be addressed 
first.  Finite values of these metrics are necessary to ensure sufficient 
communication in the network.


2.3 Environmental parameters

The theoretical results of [1-3] highlight the importance of the environmental 
conditions and technological choices of the wireless network in the context of 
scalability.  For example, the traffic pattern, the path loss exponent, or the 
area of the network domain can impose limitations on scalability.  In general, 
the following environmental parameters may affect scalability:

- Network characteristics:
  * Mobility pattern of the nodes 
  * Initial distribution of node locations 
  * Area of the network domain
  * Existence of a wired backbone; relation between numbers of nodes and base 
	stations

- Traffic pattern:
  * Choice of destinations: random, local, etc
  * Average number of hops between a source and a destination

- Routing layer:
  * Method used to choose the next hop node of the received data
  * Overhead introduced to facilitate these next hop decisions
  * Method to identify nodes; e.g., uniquely identifying N nodes requires 
	Theta(log(N)) IDs, which grows with N indefinitely.
  * Response to errors and failures
  * Fairness in forwarding decisions

- Medium access layer:
  * Reception model: collision-based, SINR threshold-based, BER-based or 
	probability-based, adaptive rate models
  * Transmission model: ability to maintain multiple transmissions and/or 
	receptions simultaneously
  * Scheduling of transmissions 
  * Response to unsuccessful transmissions
  * Fairness in medium acquisition

- Physical layer:
  * Link bandwidth
  * Transmission and reception modes: omnidirectional, directional; beamwidth, 
	side lobes
  * Propagation model: path loss exponent, fading, shadowing
  * Modulation scheme: narrowband, wideband; processing gain, interference c
	ancellation
  * Power control, maximum transmission power, noise conditions

- Node design:
* Memory/storage at nodes: maximum storage space, certain amount of buffer overflow 
	permitted, loss is not allowed, or QoS buffering used
* Processing power: maximum number of CPU cycles per unit time, identical allocation 
	to all nodes, preference given to some nodes


2.4 Vanishing efficiency

EFFICIENCY of a network is said to VANISH as an independent parameter tends to infinity 
if ANY of the primary metrics becomes arbitrarily large.

2.5 Absolute scalability

A method is termed ABSOLUTELY SCALABLE with respect to a given parameter, if the 
efficiency of the network DOES NOT VANISH as the parameter tends to infinity.  To 
evaluate whether or not a method is absolutely scalable, precise definitions of all 
primary metrics are required.

It should be noted that though, in some cases, the efficiency does not vanish, it is 
possible that the primary metrics are finite, but very large.  Other techniques and 
tradeoffs may be used to improve their values, though these techniques are not 
addressed here.

2.5.1 Example of absolute scalability

Consider the following example:  we choose the number of nodes, N, as the independent 
parameter.  An entire scalability vector should be considered with the different 
primary metrics as components, but for simplicity, we consider here only the 
ôtotal overheadö (as defined in [4]) component.

For constant average node degree, maximum path lengths increasing as Theta(N^0.5) and 
other assumptions described in [4], the total overhead of HSLS (Hazy Sighted Link 
State Routing Protocol) is Theta(N^1.5).  Also, in the network model of [4], maximum 
achievable throughput of the entire network is Theta(N).  This means that as 
N -> infinity, the total overhead of HSLS exceeds the amount the network can actually 
support, so the throughput and efficiency vanish.  Thus, we say that HSLS is not a
bsolutely scalable with respect to the triple [number of nodes, total overhead, 
Theta(N^0.5) maximum path lengthsà([4]Æs environmental parameters)].

2.6 Relative scalability

An method e1 is termed MORE SCALABLE than another method e2 with respect to a given 
parameter p and primary metric m (completely specified), if the limit as p approaches 
infinity of m(e1)/m(e2) is zero.  If the result of this limit is a positive constant, 
then we say e1 and e2 are EQUALLY scalable.

Note that without also specifying the metric m, we are unable to define the relative 
scalability of e1 and e2 in terms of a parameter p.  e1 may be more scalable than e2 
with respect to one metric, but less scalable with respect to another metric.

2.6.1 Example of relative scalability

Returning to the example from [4], we again use the number of nodes as the independent 
parameter, and compare HSLS total overhead with SLS (Standard Link State).  The entire 
scalability vectors should be considered, but we choose to evaluate the ôtotal overheadö 
component only.

Using all the assumptions from the previous example, the total overhead of e1 = HSLS 
is Theta(N^1.5) and the total overhead of e2 = SLS is Theta(N^2).  This means that, 

lim  [m(e1)/m(e2)] = lim  [Theta(N^1.5)/Theta(N^2)] = lim  Theta(N^{-0.5}) = 0 
N->inf.              N->inf.                          N->inf.

Using the above definitions, this means that HSLS is more scalable than SLS with respect 
to the triple [number of nodes, total overhead, Theta(N^0.5) maximum path lengthsà([4]Æs
environmental parameters)].

2.7 Relative weak scalability

It is possible that a parameter grows large in an ad hoc network, but cannot grow 
arbitrarily large.  In particular, it might be impossible/impractical for a parameter 
to grow larger than some value, M.  In this case, we consider only an interval [a, M], 
where a is the minimum value of the parameter and M is its maximum value.  A method e1 
is termed MORE WEAKLY SCALABLE than another method e2 with respect to a given 
parameter p and primary metric m, if the rate of decay of the metric measuring e1, m(e1), 
is slower than that metric measuring e2, m(e2).  

Let [m(e1(b))]Æ be the derivative (with respect to the independent parameter p) of m 
measuring e1, when p=b.  If the rate [m(e1) û m(e2)]Æ is negative at some point, it 
means that m(e1) is increasing more slowly than m(e2), so that e1 is more scalable at 
point p=b.  To find the scalability over a range, we average the scalabilities at all 
points in the interval over which p can assume values.  {Int_a^M [[m(e1(p))]Æ] dp}/(M-a) 
is the average value of the derivative of m(e1(p)) over the interval [a, M], and 
{Int_a^M [[m(e1(p))-m(e2(p))]Æ] dp}/(M-a) is the average value of the derivative of 
m(e1(p))-m(e2(p)) over the interval [a, M].  Evaluating this expression by the 
fundamental law of Calculus, {Int_a^M [[m(e1(p))-m(e2(p))]Æ] dp}/(M-a) = 
{[m(e1(M)) û m(e2(M))] û [m(e1(a)) û m(e2(a))]}/(M-a).   

Therefore, e1 is MORE WEAKLY SCALABLE than e2 with respect to the metric m and the 
parameter p over the range [a, M] if m(e1(M))ûm(e1(a)) < m(e2(M))-m(e2(a)).

Similarly, if m(e1(M))ûm(e1(a)) = m(e2(M))-m(e2(a)), then e1 and e2 are EQUALLY SCALABLE 
with respect to the metric m and the parameter p over the range [a, M].

3. Challenges in application of results

The framework we suggest in this document allows users to compare the scalability of 
methods, but we have yet to include the idea of a fair comparison.  Clearly, absolute 
scalability, relative scalability, and relative weak scalability of a method are heavily
dependent on the environmental parameters.  Hence, when considering any of the primary 
metrics, the environmental parameters must be specified with as much detail as possible.  
A certain set of environmental parameters may lend itself well to one method compared 
to another.  For example, if the number of nodes is increased, then increasing the area 
of the network domain and keeping the node density constant could lead to good scalability
patterns, while keeping the area of the network domain constant would cause the system 
to suffer from high node density and would not likely be scalable. It may be difficult 
to find a set of environmental parameters, which can lead to a fair comparison among 
methods.  Furthermore, interactions among environmental parameters and between independent 
and environmental parameters may also affect fairness of a comparison. For example, 
while comparing relative scalability of two routing protocols, the choice of the MAC 
layer protocol may change the result of the comparison.  As a result, although we have 
provided a framework to evaluate scalability of methods, standardization of a set of 
environmental parameters remains a challenge to achieve fair comparison among different 
methods.
