                         IMAP REPLACE Extension
                      draft-brandt-imap-replace-02

Abstract

   This document defines an IMAP extension which can be used to replace
   an existing message in a message store with a new message.  Message
   replacement is a common operation for clients that automatically save
   drafts or notes as a user composes them.

1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Formal syntax is defined by [RFC5234].

   Example lines prefaced by "C:" are sent by the client and ones
   prefaced by "S:" by the server.

2.  Overview

   This document defines an IMAP [RFC3501] extension to facilitate
   replacing an existing message with a new one.  This is accomplished
   by defining a new REPLACE command and extending the UID command to
   allow UID REPLACE.

   Since there is no replace function in the base IMAP specification,
   clients have instead had to use a combination of three separate
   commands issued in serial fashion; APPEND, STORE, EXPUNGE.
   Pipelining of these three commands is not recommended since failure

   of any individual command should prevent subsequent commands from
   being executed lest the original message version be lost.

   Because of the non-atomic nature of the existing sequence,
   interruptions can leave messages in intermediate states which can be
   seen and acted upon by other clients.  Such interruptions can also
   strand older revisions of messages, thereby forcing the user to
   manually clean up multiple revisions of the same message in order to
   avoid wasteful quota consumption.  Additionally, the existing
   sequence can fail on APPEND due to an over-quota condition even
   though the subsequent STORE/EXPUNGE would free up enough space for
   the newly revised message.  And finally, server efficiencies may be
   possible with a single logical message replacement operation as
   compared to the existing APPEND/STORE/EXPUNGE sequence.

   In its simplest form, the REPLACE command is a single-command
   encapsulation of APPEND, STORE +flags \DELETED and UID EXPUNGE for a
   message, except that it avoids any of the quota implications or
   intermediate states associated with the 3 command sequence.  In
   handling a REPLACE command, a server MUST NOT generate a response
   code for the STORE +flags \DELETED portion of the sequence.
   Additionally, servers supporting the REPLACE command MUST NOT infer
   any inheritance of content, flags, or annotations from the message
   being replaced.  Finally, the replaced and replacing messages SHOULD
   NOT be present in the mailbox at the same time.

3.  REPLACE and UID REPLACE

3.1.  Advertising Support for REPLACE

   Servers that implement the REPLACE extension will return "REPLACE" as
   one of the supported capabilities in the CAPABILITY command response.

3.2.  REPLACE Command

   Arguments:  message sequence number
               mailbox name
               OPTIONAL flag parenthesized list
               OPTIONAL date/time string
               message literal

   Responses: no specific responses for this command

   Result:     OK - replace completed
               NO - replace error; can't remove specified message
                    or can't add new message content
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

   Example:
     C: A003 REPLACE 4 Drafts (\Seen \Draft) {312}
     S: + Ready for literal data
     C: Date: Thu, 1 Jan 2015 00:05:00 -0500 (EST)
     C: From: Fritz Schmidt <fritz.ze@example.org>
     C: Subject: happy new year !!
     C: To: miss.mitzy@example.org
     C: Message-Id: <B238822388-0100000@example.org>
     C: MIME-Version: 1.0
     C: Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; CHARSET=US-ASCII
     C:
     C: Just saw the best fireworks show. Wish you were here.
     C:
     S: * 4 EXPUNGE
     S: A003 OK [APPENDUID 1 2000] Replace completed

3.3.  UID REPLACE Command

   This extends the first form of the UID command (see [RFC3501]
   Section 6.4.8) to add the REPLACE command defined above as a valid
   argument.  This form of REPLACE uses a UID rather than sequence
   number as its first parameter.

   Example:
     C: A004 UID REPLACE 2000 Drafts (\Seen \Draft) {350}
     S: + Ready for literal data
     C: Date: Thu, 1 Jan 2015 00:06:00 -0500 (EST)
     C: From: Fritz Schmidt <fritz.ze@example.org>
     C: Subject: happy new year !!
     C: To: miss.mitzy@example.org
     C: Message-Id: <B238822389-0100000@example.org>
     C: MIME-Version: 1.0
     C: Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; CHARSET=US-ASCII
     C:
     C: Just saw the best fireworks show. Wish you were here.
     C: Hopefully next year you can join us.
     C:
     S: * 4 EXPUNGE
     S: A004 OK [APPENDUID 1 2001] Replace completed

3.4.  Semantics of REPLACE and UID REPLACE

   The REPLACE and UID REPLACE commands take five arguments: a message
   identifier, a named mailbox, an optional parenthesized flag list, an
   optional message date/time string, and a message literal.  The
   message literal will be appended to the named mailbox, and the
   message specified by the message identifier will be removed from the

   selected mailbox.  These operations will appear to the client as a
   single action.  This has the same effect as the following sequence:

      1. APPEND
      2. [UID] STORE +FLAGS.SILENT \DELETED
      3. UID EXPUNGE

   In the cited sequence, the quota implications of the APPEND are
   evaluated within the context of the pending EXPUNGE so that only the
   net quota consumption is considered.  Additionally, the EXPUNGE
   portion of the sequence only applies to the specified message, not
   all messages flagged as \Deleted.

   Although the effect of REPLACE is identical to the steps above, the
   semantics are not identical; similar to MOVE [RFC6851], the
   intermediate states produced do not occur, and the response codes are
   different.  In particular, the response codes for EXPUNGE and APPEND
   will be returned while those for the STORE operation MUST NOT be
   generated.

   When an error occurs while processing REPLACE or UID REPLACE, the
   server MUST NOT leave the selected mailbox in an inconsistent state;
   any untagged EXPUNGE response MUST NOT be sent until all actions are
   successfully completed.

   While it may be common for the named mailbox argument to match the
   selected mailbox for the common use case of replacing a draft, the
   REPLACE extension intentionally does not require the two to be the
   same.  As an example, it's possible to use the REPLACE command to
   replace a message in the \Drafts special-use mailbox with a message
   in the \Sent special-use mailbox following message submission.

   Because of the similarity of REPLACE to APPEND, extensions that
   affect APPEND affect REPLACE in the same way.  Response codes such
   TRYCREATE (see [RFC3501] Section 6.3.11), as well as those defined by
   extensions, are sent as appropriate.  See Section 4 for more
   information about how REPLACE interacts with other IMAP extensions.

3.5.  IMAP State Diagram Impacts

   Unlike the APPEND command which is valid in the authenticated state,
   the REPLACE and UID REPLACE commands MUST only be valid in the
   selected state.  This difference from APPEND is necessary since
   REPLACE operates on message sequence numbers.

4.  Interaction with other extensions

   This section describes how REPLACE interacts with some other IMAP
   extensions.

4.1.  RFC 4314, ACL

   The ACL rights [RFC4314] required for UID REPLACE are the union of
   the ACL rights required for UID STORE and UID EXPUNGE in the current
   mailbox, and APPEND in the target mailbox.

4.2.  RFC 4469, CATENATE

   Servers supporting both REPLACE and CATENATE [RFC4469] MUST support
   the addtional append-data and resp-text-code elements defined the
   Formal Syntax section of RFC4469 in conjunction with the REPLACE
   command.  When combined with CATENATE, REPLACE can become a quite
   efficient way for message manipulation.

Internet-Draft           IMAP REPLACE Extension             January 2016


4.3.  RFC 4315, UIDPLUS

   Servers supporting both REPLACE and UIDPLUS [RFC4315] SHOULD send
   APPENDUID in response to a UID REPLACE command.  For additional
   information see section 3 of RFC4315.  Servers implementing REPLACE
   and UIDPLUS are also advised to send the APPENDUID response code in
   an untagged OK before sending the EXPUNGE or replaced responses.
   (Sending the APPENDUID in the tagged OK, as described in the UIDPLUS
   specification means that the client first receives an EXPUNGE for a
   message and afterwards APPENDUID for the new message.  It can be
   unnecessarily difficult to process that sequence usefully.)

4.4.  RFC 6785, IMAP Events in Sieve

   REPLACE applies to IMAP events in Sieve [RFC6785] in the same way
   that APPEND does.  Therefore, REPLACE can cause a Sieve script to be
   invoked with the imap.cause set to "APPEND".  Because the
   intermediate state of STORE +FLAGS.SILENT \DELETED is not exposed by
   REPLACE, no action will be taken that results in a imap.cause of
   FLAG.

4.5.  RFC 7162, CONDSTORE/QRESYNC

   Servers implementing both REPLACE and CONDSTORE/QRESYNC [RFC7162]
   MUST treat the message being replaced as if it were being removed
   with a UID EXPUNGE command.  Sections 3.2.9 and 3.2.10 of RFC 7162
   are particularly relevant for this condition.

5.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [RFC5234].  [RFC3501] defines
   the non-terminals "capability","command-select", "mailbox", and "seq-
   number".  [RFC4466] defines the non-terminal "append-message".

   Except as noted otherwise, all alphabetic characters are case-
   insensitive.  The use of upper or lower case characters to define
   token strings is for editorial clarity only.  Implementations MUST
   accept these strings in a case-insensitive fashion.

   capability     =/ "REPLACE"

   command-select =/ replace
   replace        = "REPLACE" SP seq-number SP mailbox append-message
   uid            = "UID" SP (copy / fetch/ search / store / move /
                              replace)

6.  Security Considerations

   This document is believed to add no security problems beyond those
   that may already exist with the base IMAP specificaiton.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to add REPLACE to the "IMAP 4 Capabilities"
   registry, http://www.iana.org/assignments/imap4-capabilities.
