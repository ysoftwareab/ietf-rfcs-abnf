1.0 Introduction  
     
   The PANA (Protocol for Carrying Authentication for Network Access)  
   Working Group is developing methods for authenticating clients to the  
   access network using IP based protocols. This document discusses the  
   threats to such IP based protocols.    
     
   A client wishing to get access to the network must carry on multiple  
   steps. First, it needs to discover the IP address of the PANA  
   authentication agent (PAA) and then execute an authentication  
   protocol to authenticate itself to the network. Once the client is  
   authenticated, there might be other messages exchanged during the  
   lifetime of the network access. This document discusses the threats  
   in these steps without discussing any solutions. The requirements  
   arising out of these threats will be used as input to the PANA  
   Working Group.

3.0 Terminology and Definitions  
  
   Client Access Device  
     
      A network element (e.g., notebook computer, PDA, etc.) that  
      requires access to a provider's network.  
     
   Network Access Server (NAS)  
     
      Network device that provides access to the network.  
        
   PANA Client (PaC)  
     
      An entity in the edge subnet, who is wishing to obtain network  
      access from a PANA authentication agent within a network. A PANA  
      client is associated with a device and a set of credentials to  
      prove its identity within the scope of PANA.  
     
   PANA Authentication Agent (PAA)  
     
      An entity whose responsibility is to authenticate the PANA client  
      and grant network access service to the client's device.  
     
   Authentication Server (AS)  
     
      An entity that authenticates the PANA client. It may be co-located  
      with PANA authentication agent or part of the back-end  
      infrastructure.  
        
   Device Identifier (DI)  
     
      The identifier used by the network as a handle to control and  
      police the network access of a client. Depending on the access  
      technology, identifier might contain any of IP address, link-layer  
      address, switch port number, etc. of a device. PANA authentication  
      agent keeps a table for binding device identifiers to the PANA  
      clients. At most one PANA client should be associated with a DI on  
      a PANA authentication agent.  
        
   Enforcement Point (EP)

      A node that is capable of filtering packets sent by the PANA  
      client using the DI information authorized by PANA authentication  
      agent.  
  
   Compound methods  
     
      Authentication protocol where, sequence of methods are used one  
      after an other or where methods are tunneled inside an another  
      independently established tunnel between the client and server  
      [TUN-EAP].  
     
4.0 Usage Scenarios  
     
   PANA is intended to be used in an environment where there is no a  
   priori trust relationship or security association between the PaC and  
   other nodes like PAA and EP. In these environments, one may observe  
   the following.  
      
       o The link between PaC and PAA may be a shared medium       
          (e.g., Ethernet) or may not be a shared medium (e.g., DSL  
          network).  
  
       o All the PaCs may be authenticated to the access network at  
          layer 2 (e.g., 3GPP2 CDMA network) and share a security  
          association with layer 2 authentication agent (e.g., BTS). The  
          PaCs still don't trust each other i.e., any PaC can pretend to  
          be a PAA, spoof IP addresses and launch various other attacks.  
  
   The scenarios mentioned above affect the threat model of PANA. This  
   document discusses the various threats in the context of the above  
   network access scenarios for a better understanding of the threats.  
   In the following discussion, any reference to a link that is not  
   shared (or non-shared) is assumed to be physically secure. If such an  
   assumption cannot be made about the link, then it becomes the same as  
   the link that is being shared by more than one node.  
  
5.0 Trust Relationships  
     
   PANA authentication involves a client (PaC), PANA agent (PAA),  
   Authentication server (AS) and an Enforcement point (EP). The AS here  
   refers to the AAA server that resides in the home realm of the PaC.  
     
   The entities that have a priori trust relationships before PANA  
   begins are as follows.  
     
     1) PAA and AS: The PaC belonging to the same administrative domain  
        as the AS, often needs to use resources provided by PAA that  
        belongs to another administrative domain. PAA authenticates the  
        PaC before providing local network access. The credentials

                         PANA threat analysis                June 2004  
  
  
        provided by PaC for authentication may or may not be understood  
        by PAA. If PAA does not understand the credentials, it needs to  
        communicate with the AS in a different domain to verify the  
        credentials. The threats in the communication path between PAA  
        and AS are already covered in [RAD-EAP]. To counter these  
        threats, the communication between PAA and AS are secured using  
        a static or dynamic security association.  
  
     2) PAA and EP: The PAA and EP belong to the same administrative  
        domain. Hence, the network operator can setup a security  
        association to protect the traffic exchanged between them. This  
        document discusses the threats in this path.  
  
     3) PaC and AS: The PaC and AS belong to the same administrative  
        domain and share a trust relationship. When PaC uses a different  
        domain than its home for network access, it provides its  
        credentials to the PAA in the visited network for  
        authentication. The information provided by PaC traverses the  
        PaC-PAA path and   PAA-AS path. The threats in PAA-AS path are  
        already discussed in [RAD-EAP]. This document discusses the  
        threats in PaC-PAA path.  
  
   It is possible that some of the entities like PAA, AS and EP are    
   co-located. In those cases, it can be safely assumed that there are  
   no significant external threats in their communication.  
  
   The entities that do not have any trust relationship before PANA  
   begins are as follows.  
     
     1) PaC and PAA: The PaC and PAA normally belong to two different  
        administrative domains. They do not necessarily share a trust  
        relationship initially. They establish a security association in  
        the process of authentication. All messages exchanged between  
        PaC and PAA are subject to various threats, which are discussed  
        in this document.  
  
     2) PaC and EP: The EP belongs to the same administrative domain as  
        PAA and hence PaC and EP do not necessarily share a trust  
        relationship initially. When PaC is successfully authenticated,  
        it may result in key establishment between PaC and PAA, which  
        can be further used to secure the link between PaC and EP. For  
        example, EAP keying framework [EAP-KEY], defines a three party  
        EAP exchange where the clients derive the transient sessions  
        keys to secure the link between the peer and NAS in their final  
        step. Similarly, PANA will provide the ability to establish keys  
        between PaC and EP that can be used to secure the link further.  
        This is further discussed in section 6.4 below.

6.0 Threat Scenarios  
     
   The PANA authentication client (PaC) needs to discover the PAA first.  
   This involves either sending solicitations or waiting for  
   advertisements. Once it has discovered the PAA, it will lead to  
   authentication exchange with PAA. Once the access is granted, PaC  
   will most likely exchange data with other nodes in the Internet.  
   These steps are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM), denial of  
   service (DoS), and service theft attacks, which are discussed below.  
  
   The threats are grouped by the various stages the client goes through  
   to gain access to the network. Section 6.1 discusses the threats  
   related to PAA discovery. Section 6.2 discusses the threats related  
   to authentication itself. Section 6.3 discusses the threats involved  
   while leaving the network. Section 6.4 discusses service theft.  
   Section 6.5 discusses the threats in PAA-EP path. Section 6.6  
   discusses the miscellaneous threats.  
     
   Some of the threats discussed in the following sections may be  
   specific to shared links. The threat may be absent on non-shared  
   links. Hence, it is only required to prevent the threat on shared  
   links. Instead of specifying a separate set of requirements for  
   shared links and non-shared links, this document just specifies one  
   set of requirements with the following wording: "PANA MUST be able to  
   prevent threat X". This means that the PANA protocol should be  
   capable of preventing threat X. The feature that prevents threat X  
   may or may not be used depending on the deployment.  
  
6.1 PAA Discovery  
  
   The PAA is discovered by sending solicitations or receiving  
   advertisements. Following are the possible threats.  
     
   T6.1.1: A malicious node can pretend to be a PAA by sending a     
           spoofed advertisement.  
  
   In existing dial-up networks, the clients authenticate to the network  
   but generally do not verify the authenticity of the messages coming  
   from Network Access Server (NAS). This mostly works because the link  
   between the device and the NAS is not shared with other nodes  
   (assuming that nobody tampers with the physical link), and clients  
   trust the NAS and the phone network to provide the service. Spoofing  
   attacks are not present in this environment because the PaC may  
   assume that the other end of the link is the PAA.  
     
   In environments where the link is shared, this threat is present as  
   any node can pretend to be a PAA. Even if the nodes are authenticated  
   at layer 2, this threat is present. It is difficult to protect the  
  
  
Parthasarathy           Expires December 2004                [Page 6]  
                         PANA threat analysis                June 2004  
  
  
   discovery process, as there is no a priori trust relationship between  
   PAA and PaC. In deployments where EP can police the packets that are  
   sent among the PaCs, it is possible to filter out the unauthorized  
   PANA packets (e.g., PAA advertisements sent by PaC) and prevent this  
   threat.  
     
   The advertisement may be used to include other information like  
   supported authentication methods etc., besides the discovery of the  
   PAA itself. This can lead to a bidding down attack, as a malicious  
   node can send a spoofed advertisement with capabilities that indicate  
   less secure authentication methods than what the real PAA supports,  
   thereby fooling the PaC into negotiating a less secure authentication  
   method than what would otherwise be available.  
     
   Requirement 1  
     
   PANA MUST not assume that the discovery process is protected.  
     
6.2 Authentication  
  
   This section discusses the threats specific to the authentication  
   protocol. Section 6.2.1 discusses the possible threat associated with  
   success/failure indications that are transmitted to PaC at the end of  
   the authentication. Section 6.2.2 discusses the man-in-the-middle  
   attack when compound methods are used. Section 6.2.3 discusses the  
   replay attack and section 6.2.4 discusses about the device identifier  
   attack.  
     
6.2.1 Success or Failure Indications  
  
   Some authentication protocols e.g., EAP, have a special message to  
   indicate success or failure. An attacker can send false  
   authentication success or failure message to the PaC. By sending  
   false failure message, the attacker can prevent the client from  
   accessing the network. By sending false success message, the attacker  
   can prematurely end the authentication exchange effectively denying  
   service for the PaC.  
     
   If the link is not shared, then this threat is absent as ingress  
   filtering can prevent the attacker from impersonating as the PAA.  
     
   If the link is shared, it is easy to spoof these packets. If layer 2  
   provides per-packet encryption with pair-wise keys, it might make it  
   hard for the attacker to guess the success or failure packet that the  
   client would accept. Even if the node is already authenticated at  
   layer 2, it can still pretend to be a PAA and spoof the success or  
   failure.

                         PANA threat analysis                June 2004  
  
  
   This attack is possible if the success or failure indication is not  
   protected using a security association between the PaC and the PAA.  
   In order to avoid this attack, the PaC and PAA should mutually  
   authenticate each other. In the process of mutually authenticating  
   each other, they should be able to establish keys to protect the  
   success or failure indications. It may not be possible to protect the  
   success or failure indication always as the keys may not be  
   established prior to transmitting the success or failure packet. If  
   the client is re-authenticating to the network, it can use the  
   previously established security association to protect the success or  
   failure indications. Similarly, all PANA messages that are exchanged  
   during the authentication prior to key establishment may not be  
   protected.  
     
   Requirement 2  
     
   PANA MUST be able to mutually authenticate the PaC and PAA. PANA MUST  
   be able to establish keys between the PaC and PAA to protect the PANA  
   messages.  
     
6.2.2 MITM attack  
     
   A malicious node can claim to be PAA to the real PaC and claim to be  
   PaC to the real PAA. This is a man in the middle (MITM) attack where  
   the PaC is fooled to think that it is communicating with real PAA and  
   the real PAA is fooled to think that it is communicating with real  
   PaC.  
     
   If the link is not shared, this threat is absent as ingress filtering  
   can prevent the attacker from acting as man in the middle.  
     
   If the link is shared, this threat is present. Even if the layer 2  
   provides per-packet protection, the attacker can act as man in the  
   middle and launch this attack. An instance of MITM attack, when  
   compound authentication methods are used is described in [TUN-EAP].  
   In these attacks, the server first authenticates to the client. As  
   the client has not proven its identity yet, the server acts as the  
   man-in-the-middle, tunneling the identity of the legitimate client to  
   gain access to the network. The attack is possible because there is  
   no verification that the same entities participated among the  
   compound methods. It is not possible to do such verification if  
   compound methods are used without being able to create cryptographic  
   binding among them. This implies that PANA will be vulnerable to such  
   attacks if compound methods are used without being able to  
   cryptographically bind them. Note that the attack does not exist if  
   the keys derived during the tunnel establishment are not used for  
   authenticating the client e.g., tunnel keys are used for just  
   protecting the identity of the client.

                         PANA threat analysis                June 2004  
  
  
   Requirement 3  
     
   When compound authentication methods are used in PANA, the methods  
   MUST be cryptographically bound.  
     
     
6.2.3 Replay Attack  
  
   A malicious node can replay the messages that caused authentication  
   failure or success at a later time to create false failures or  
   success. The attacker can also potentially replay other messages of  
   the PANA protocol to deny service to the PaC.  
     
   If the link is not shared, this threat is absent as ingress filtering  
   can prevent the attacker from impersonating as PAA and replay the  
   packets.  
     
   If the link is shared, this threat is present. If the packets are  
   encrypted at layer 2 using pair-wise keys, it will make it hard for  
   the attacker to learn the unencrypted (i.e., original) packet that  
   needs to be replayed. Even if layer 2 provides replay protection, the  
   attacker can still replay the PANA messages (layer 3) for denying  
   service to the client.  
     
   Requirement 4  
     
   PANA MUST be able to protect itself against replay attacks.  
     
6.2.4 Device Identifier Attack  
  
   When the client is successfully authenticated, the PAA sends access  
   control information to the EP for granting access to the network. The  
   access control information typically contains the device identifier  
   of the PaC, which is obtained from the IP headers and MAC headers of  
   the packets exchanged during the authentication process or carried  
   explicitly in the PANA protocol field. The attacker can gain  
   unauthorized access into the network using the following steps.  
     
     . An attacker pretends to be a PAA and sends advertisements. PaC  
        gets fooled and starts exchanging packets with the attacker.  
     . The attacker modifies the IP source address on the packet,  
        adjusts the UDP/TCP checksum and forwards the packet to the real  
        PAA. It does the same on return packets also.  
     . When the real PaC is successfully authenticated, the attacker  
        gains access to the network as the packets contained the IP  
        address (and potentially the MAC address also) of the attacker.  
     
   If the link is not shared, this threat is absent, as the attacker  
   cannot impersonate as PAA and intercept the packets from PaC.

                         PANA threat analysis                June 2004  
  
  
     
   If the link is shared, this threat is present. If the layer 2  
   provides per-packet protection, it is not possible to change the MAC  
   address and hence this threat may be absent in such cases if EP  
   filters both on IP and MAC address.  
     
   Requirement 5  
     
   PANA MUST be able to protect the device identifier against spoofing  
   when it is exchanged between the PaC and PAA.  
     
     
6.3 PaC leaving the network  
     
   When the PaC leaves the network, it can inform the PAA before  
   disconnecting from the network so that the resources used by PaC can  
   be accounted properly. The PAA may also choose to revoke the access  
   any time if it deems necessary. Following are the possible threats.    
     
   T6.3.1: A malicious node can pretend to be a PAA and revoke the  
           access to PaC.  
     
   T6.3.2: A malicious node can pretend to be a real PaC and transmit a  
           disconnect message.  
     
   T6.3.3: The PaC can leave the network without notifying the PAA or EP  
           e.g., the Ethernet cable is unplugged, system crash. An  
           attacker can pretend to be the PaC and start using the  
           network.  
     
   If the link is not shared, the threats T6.3.1 and T6.3.2 are absent.  
   The threat T6.3.3 may still be present. If there is no layer 2  
   indication or the layer 2 indication cannot be relied up on, then the  
   threat T6.3.3 is still present on non-shared links.  
     
   If the link is shared, all of the above threats are present as any  
   node on the link can spoof the disconnect message. Even if the layer  
   2 has per-packet authentication, the attacker can pretend to be a PaC  
   e.g., by spoofing the IP address, and disconnect from the network.  
   Similarly, any node can pretend to be a PAA and revoke the access to  
   the PaC. Hence, T6.3.1 and T6.3.2 are possible even on links where  
   layer 2 is secured. The threat T6.3.3 can be prevented if layer 2  
   provides per-packet authentication. The attacker cannot subsume the  
   PaC that left the network without knowing the keys that protect the  
   packet at layer 2.  
  
   Requirement 6

   PANA MUST be able to protect disconnect and revocation messages. PANA  
   MUST NOT depend on the PaC sending a disconnect message.  
     
     
6.4 Service theft  
     
   An attacker can gain unauthorized access into the network by stealing  
   the service from another client. Once the real PaC is successfully  
   authenticated, EP will have filters in place to prevent unauthorized  
   access into the network. The filters will be based on something that  
   will be carried on every packet. For example, the filter could be  
   based on IP and MAC address where the packets will be dropped unless  
   the packets coming with certain IP address match the MAC address  
   also. Following are the possible threats.  
     
   T6.4.1: Attacker can spoof both the IP and MAC address of an  
           authorized client to gain unauthorized access. Attacker can  
           launch this attack easily by just sniffing the wire for IP  
           and MAC address. This lets the attacker use the network  
           without any authorization, getting a free service.  
     
   T6.4.2: The PaC can leave the network without notifying the PAA or EP  
           e.g., the Ethernet cable is unplugged, system crash. An  
           attacker can pretend to be the PaC and start using the  
           network.  
     
   If the link is not shared, T6.4.1 is absent as there is only one  
   client on the link and ingress filtering can prevent the use of  
   authorized IP and MAC address by the attacked on another link.  
     
   If the link is shared, both the threats are present. If layer 2  
   provides per-packet protection using pair-wise keys, both the threats  
   can be prevented.  
     
   Requirement 7  
     
   PANA MUST securely bind the authenticated session to the device  
   identifier of the client, to prevent service theft. PANA MUST be able  
   to bootstrap a shared secret between the PaC and PAA which can be  
   further used to setup a security association between PaC and EP to  
   provide cryptographic protection against service theft.  
     
6.5 PAA-EP communication  
     
   After a successful authentication, the PAA needs to communicate the  
   access control information of the PaC to EP so that PaC will be  
   allowed to access the network. The information communicated would  
   contain at least the device identifier of the PaC. If strong security  
   is needed, PAA will communicate a shared secret known only to PaC and

   PAA, for setting up a security association between PaC and EP.  
   Following are the possible threats.  
     
   T6.5.1: Attacker can eavesdrop to learn the information communicated  
           between PAA and EP. The attacker can further use this  
           information to spoof the real PaC and also setup an security  
           association for gaining access to the network. This threat is  
           absent, if the attacker cannot eavesdrop the link e.g., PAA  
           and EP are communicating on a separate link from that of  
           visiting PaCs.  
     
   T6.5.2: Attacker can pretend to be PAA and send false information to  
           EP for gaining access to the network. The attacker has to  
           send its own device identifier and also a shared secret in  
           the case of stronger security so that EP will let the  
           attacker access the network.  
     
   If the communication between PAA and EP is protected, these threats  
   are absent.  
     
   Requirement 8  
     
   The communication between the PAA and EP MUST be protected against  
   eavesdropping and spoofing attacks.   
     
6.6 Miscellaneous attacks  
     
   T6.6.1: There are various forms of DoS attacks that can be launched  
           on the PAA or AS. A few are mentioned below. As it is hard to  
           defend against some of the DoS attacks, the protocol should  
           be designed carefully to mitigate or prevent such attacks.  
  
              . Attacker can bombard the PAA with lots of  
                 authentication requests. If PAA and AS are not  
                 collocated, PAA may have to allocate resources to store  
                 some state about PaC locally before it receives the  
                 response from the backend AS. This can deplete memory  
                 resources on PAA.  
     
              . The attacker can force the PAA or AS to make  
                 computationally intensive operations with minimal  
                 effort, that can deplete the CPU resources of the PAA  
                 or AS.  
           
   T6.6.2: PaC acquires an IP address by using stateful or stateless  
           mechanisms before PANA authentication begins [PANAREQ]. When  
           the IP addresses are assigned before the client  
           authentication, it opens up the possibility of DoS attacks  
           where unauthenticated malicious nodes can deplete the IP  
  
  
Parthasarathy           Expires December 2004               [Page 12]

           address space by acquiring multiple IP addresses, or denying  
           allocation to others by responding to every duplicate address  
           detection (DAD) query.  
     
           Depleting a /64 IPv6 link-local address space or a /8 RFC1918  
           private address space requires a brute-force attack. Such an  
           attack is part of a DoS class that can equally target the  
           link capacity or the CPU cycles on the target system by  
           bombarding arbitrary packets. Therefore solely handling the  
           IP address depletion attack is not going to improve the  
           security as a more general solution is needed to tackle the  
           whole class of brute-force attacks.  
             
           The DAD attack can be prevented by deploying secure address  
           resolution that does not depend on the client authentication,  
           such as [SEND]. The attack may also be prevented if the EP is  
           placed in between the PaCs to monitor the ND/ARP activity and  
           detect DAD attacks (excessive NA/ARP replies). If none of  
           these solutions are applicable to a deployment, the PaCs can  
           send arbitrary packets to each other without going through  
           the EP which enables a class of attacks that are based on   
           interfering with the PANA messaging (See T6.1.1). Since there  
           will always be an unhandled threat in this class (e.g.,  
           insecure discovery), addressing DAD attack is not going to  
           improve the overall security.  
     
7.0 Summary of Requirements  
  
        1. PANA MUST not assume that the discovery process is protected.  
     
        2. PANA MUST be able to mutually authenticate the PaC and PAA.  
          PANA MUST be able to establish keys between the PaC and PAA  
          to protect the PANA messages.  
  
        3. When compound authentication methods are used in PANA, the  
          methods MUST be cryptographically bound.  
  
        4. PANA MUST be able to protect itself against replay attacks.  
  
        5. PANA MUST be able to protect the device identifier against  
          spoofing when it is exchanged between the PaC and PAA.  
  
        6. PANA MUST be able to protect disconnect and revocation  
          messages. PANA MUST NOT depend on the PaC sending a  
          disconnect message.  
  
        7. PANA MUST securely bind the authenticated session to the  
          device identifier of the client, to prevent service theft.  
          PANA MUST be able to bootstrap a shared secret between the

          PaC and PAA which can be further used to setup a security  
          association between PaC and EP to provide cryptographic  
          protection against service theft.  
  
        8. The communication between the PAA and EP MUST be protected  
          against eavesdropping and spoofing attacks.
