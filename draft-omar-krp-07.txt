Abstract

   This document specifies KHALED Routing Protocol (KRP), an Exterior Gateway
   Protocol (EGP) that introduces a new way of routing IP packets from
   the source to the destination through different Autonomous Systems (ASs).
   
   The enhancements that KRP adds are:

      a) Decreasing the BGP routing table (using the regions concept).
      b) Enhancing the routing function (using the stored information).
      c) Choosing a better path (using the AS Weight)
      c) Enhancing the QoS (using the information separation). 
  
   KRP sometimes referred to as Regional Routing Protocol (RRP).
