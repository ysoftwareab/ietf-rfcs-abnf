Internet-Draft                  HTML RFC                    October 2014


1.  Introduction

   As described in [I-D.flanagan-rfc-framework], the RFC Series is
   changing.  One of those changes includes the RFC Editor publishing a
   non-canonical HTML version of RFCs.

   This memo describes the HTML format that will be used as one of the
   publication formats for the RFC Series.  It defines a strict subset
   of HTML appropriate for RFC Series documents.  The visual layout of
   the document will be defined through a cascading style sheet (CSS)
   [W3C.REC-CSS2-20110607].  The CSS will be included in the HTML file
   but will be described in a separate document.

2.  Requirements for the HTML Format

   This section lists the design requirements used to create the HTML
   format described in this document.  These requirements build on those
   found in [RFC6949].

   The HTML has to render correctly on a list of browsers versions that
   the RFC Editor will keep up to date outside of this document.

   These requirements are expected to change in the future to reflect
   the expectation that HTML rendering will be required for current
   versions of browsers and platforms, while ideally continuing to
   render correctly on earlier versions.

   The HTML documents may be re-rendered from the canonical XML format
   in the future to ensure the ongoing readability of the documents.
   The intent is that any re-rendering would be due to exceptional
   circumstances rather than for minor annoyances.

   The HTML must display adequately in at least one text-based browser.
   Some consumers of the RFC series can only access the series on text-
   based terminals.

   The HTML document will be self-contained, without requiring external
   files for images, CSS, JavaScript, or the like.  This will allow the
   HTML file to be moved over various non-HTTP transports (such as
   e-mail, FTP, and rsync) without breakage.

   Any use of JavaScript in the HTML document will not negatively impact
   the ability to read the document.  Some consumers of the RFC series
   routinely disable JavaScript for security purposes.

   The HTML document will allow easy local override of the default CSS
   formatting.  This will allow users who have a different visual style
   that they prefer to make RFCs display with that style without having

   to alter the contents of the HTML document.  This might also be
   valuable for allowing people with specific accessibility needs to use
   a customized CSS.

   HTML tags in documents will rarely have attributes whose only purpose
   is to affect the rendered styling, and those will only be used if it
   would not be possible to specify that styling in CSS.

   Both user-defined and autogenerated anchors must be supported and
   linkable, with user-defined anchors appearing in an "id" attribute.
   Autogenerated anchors will be generated for every heading, paragraph,
   and so on, not just those that do not have user-defined anchors.
   User-defined anchors may, and autogenerated anchors will, appear next
   to paragraphs, figures, tables, blockquotes, and section titles.

   All section, subsections, figures, and paragraphs should have stable
   numbered link anchors.  Additionally, anchors expressed in the source
   XML should be exposed as anchors in the HTML as well.

   The HTML must make it easy to separate sections along with all of
   their subsections into separate files.  This will make creating EPUB
   documents easier in the future.

   The abstract must be marked up or tagged in a way that popular search
   engines will extract it as a summary.

   The format will consist of a subset of HTML deemed to be widely-
   implementd by common browsers at the time the specification is
   created, likely to continue to be widely-implemented, and unlikely to
   cause security issues.  This will maximize the chances that future
   HTML renderers (such as new web browsers) will continue to produce
   readable text from the HTML format without the format needing to be
   changed frequently.

   Normative information must be easily accessible to the following
   consumers:

   o  People with impaired vision, including those that use large fonts
      and those that use screen readers

   o  People with difficulty distinguishing between colors

   o  People who use devices with small screens, such as cell phones

   o  Other groups TBD

   Specific instances where goals for accessibility are important in the
   design choices of the format have been called out in the text.

   NOTE: designing for these consumers does not preclude the use of
   features they cannot use, but does require that key semantic data is
   not lost when read using the tools and settings that are required by
   a given constituency.

3.  HTML Version

   The RFC Editor will periodically determine which version of the HTML
   specification will be referenced for tools generating the format
   defined in this document.  The starting version will be that defined
   in [W3C.PR-html5-20140916], commonly known as "HTML5".  Although the
   HTML specification mandates several of syntax and structure rules in
   this document, they are called out here for emphasis.

4.  HTML Syntax

   The processor emitting HTML from the XML source will follow these
   rules:

   o  The HTML source is encoded as UTF-8, as specified in [RFC3629].

   o  The document is valid HTML.

   o  Double quotes (U+0022 QUOTATION MARK: ") are used to quote
      attribute values unless the HTML specification forbids quoting a
      particular attribute.

   o  Each logical line is terminated solely with a \n (U+000A: LINE
      FEED), otherwise known as "Unix-style" line endings.

   o  Other than \n (U+000A: LINE FEED), code points less than " "
      (U+0020: SPACE) (otherwise known as "control characters") are not
      used.  Any character references that would generate these code
      points (e.g., &#0009;) may not be used.  NOTE: this rule
      explicitly forbids \t (U+0009: CHARACTER TABULATION), \f (U+000C:
      FORM FEED), and \r (U+000D: CARRIAGE RETURN) from appearing in the
      source.

   o  Comments in the canonical XML, if any, will not be copied into the
      HTML.

   o  The HTML source will be pretty-printed, using whatever consistent
      rules the tooling team deems best.

   NOTE: none of these rules affect the rendered output of the HTML, but
   are intended to increase the chance that difference tools that
   operate on the HTML source easier to write.

Internet-Draft                  HTML RFC                    October 2014


5.  Prologue

   The front matter of the HTML format contains processing information,
   metadata of various types, and styling information that applies to
   the document as a whole.  This section describes HTML that is not
   necessarily a direct transform from the XML format.  For more details
   on each of the tags that generate content in this section, see
   Section 6.

5.1.  DOCTYPE

   The DOCTYPE of the document is "html", which declares that the
   document is compliant with HTML5.  The document will start with
   exactly this string:

   <!DOCTYPE html>

5.2.  Root Element

   The root element of the document is <html>.  This element includes a
   lang attribute, whose value is a [RFC5646] language tag describing
   the natural language of the document.  The language of the RFC Series
   is English and so the language tag to be included is 'en'.

5.3.  Head Element

   The root <html> will contain a <head> element that contains the
   following elements, as needed.

5.3.1.  Charset Declaration

   In order to be correctly processed by browsers that load the HTML
   using a mechanism that does not provide a valid MIME content-type or
   charset (such as from a local file system using a "file:" URL), the
   HTML <head> element contains a <meta> element, with charset attribute
   with value 'utf-8'.

5.3.2.  Document Title

   The contents of the <title> element from the XML source will be
   placed inside an HTML <title> element in the header.

5.3.3.  Document metadata

   The following <meta> elements will be included:

   o  author - comma-separated <fullname>s of all of the <author>s from
      the XML source

Internet-Draft                  HTML RFC                    October 2014


   o  description - the abstract from the XML source

   o  generator - the name and version number of the software used to
      create the HTML

   o  keywords - comma-separated <keyword>s from the XML source

5.3.4.  Style

   The <head> element contains an embedded CSS stylesheet in a <style>
   element.  The styles in the stylesheet are to be set consistently
   between documents by the RFC Editor, according to the best practices
   of the day.

   To ensure consistent formatting, individual style attributes are not
   used in the main portion of the document source except in highly
   exceptional circumstances; each use of such attributes will be
   individually justified.

   Different readers of a specification will desire different formatting
   when reading the HTML versions of RFCs.  To facilitate this, the
   <head> element also includes a <link> to a stylesheet in the same
   directory as the HTML file, named "rfc-local.css".  Any formatting in
   the linked stylesheet will override the formatting in the included
   stylesheet.

   <style>
     body {}
     ...
   </style>
   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="rfc-local.css">

5.4.  Document Information

   Information about the document as a whole.  The <dl> element with
   id="identifiers" is the first child element of the HTML <body>
   element.  The defined terms in the definition list are "Workgroup:",
   "Series:", "Status:", "Published:", and "Authors:".

5.8.  IDs

   HTML elements that are generated from XML elements that include an
   anchor attribute will use the value of the anchor attribute
   (prepended by "#") as the id of the corresponding HTML element.  If
   there is no anchor attribute, the slugifiedName attribute of the
   contained <name> element will be used.  Otherwise, the partNumber
   attribute will be used, where it exists.

   Some HTML constructs (such as <section> (Section 6.46)) will use
   multiple of these identifiers.

5.9.  Pilcrows

   Each paragraph, artwork, or sourcecode segment outside of a <figure>
   or <table> element will be appended with a space and a "pilcrow"
   (U+00B6: PILCROW SIGN), otherwise known as a "paragraph sign".  For
   the purposes of clarity, in this document pilcrows are rendered as
   "&para;".

   The pilcrow will normally be invisible unless the element it is
   attached to is moused over.  The pilcrow will be surrounded by a link
   that points to the element it is attached to.

Internet-Draft                  HTML RFC                    October 2014


   Pilcrows are never included inside a <table> or <figure> elements,
   since the figure number or table number serve as adequate link
   targets.

   Elements that might otherwise contain a pilcrow do not get marked
   with a pilcrow if they contain one or more child elements that are
   marked with a pilcrow.

     <p id="p-1.2-2">Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought
       forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and

6.  Elements

   This section describes how each of the XML elements from
   [I-D.hoffman-xml2rfc] is rendered to HTML.

6.1.  <abstract>

   The abstract is rendered similarly to a <section> (Section 6.46) with
   anchor="abstract" and <name>Abstract</name>, but without a section
   number.

   <section id="abstract">
     <h2><a href="#abstract" class="self-ref">Abstract</a></h2>
     <p id="p-abstract-1">This document defines...
       <a href="#p-abstract-1" class="pilcrow">&para;</a>
     </p>
   </section>

6.2.  <address>

   To be documented.

6.3.  <annotation>

   To be documented.

6.4.  <area>

   Not currently rendered to HTML.

6.5.  <artwork>

   Artwork can either consist of inline text or SVG.  If the artwork is
   not inside a <figure> element, a pilcrow (Section 5.9) is included.
   Inside a <figure> element, the figure title serves the purpose of the
   pilcrow.

6.5.1.  Text Artwork

   Text artwork is rendered inside an HTML <pre> element.  Note that
   CDATA blocks do not work consistently in HTML, so all <, >, and &
   must be escaped as &lt;, &gt;, and &amp;, respectively.

   The <pre> element will have CSS classes of "artwork" and "art-"
   prepended to the value of the <artwork>'s "type" attribute, if it
   exists.

   <pre class="artwork art-ascii-art" id="p-2-16">
    ______________
   &lt; hello, world &gt;
    --------------
           \   ^__^
            \  (oo)\_______
               (__)\       )\/\
                   ||----w |
                   ||     ||
   <a href="#p-2-16" class="pilcrow">&para;</a></pre>
   </pre>

6.5.2.  SVG Artwork

   SVG artwork MUST be included inline.  The SVG is wrapped in a <div>
   element with CSS classes "artwork" and "art-svg".

   <div class="artwork art-svg" id="p-2-17">
     <svg width="100" height="100">
       <circle
         cx="50" cy="50" r="40"
         stroke="green" stroke-width="4" fill="yellow" />
     </svg>
     <a href="#p-2-17" class="pilcrow">&para;</a></pre>
   </div>

6.6.  <aside>

   This element is rendered as an HTML <aside> element, with a pilcrow
   (Section 5.9) added.

     <a href="#p-1.2-6" class="pilcrow">&para;</a>
   </aside>

6.7.  <author>

   The <author> element from the <front> of the document is rendered
   into the Section 5.4, the Section 5.3.3, and the Section 5.7.  See
   each of those sections for details.

6.8.  <b>

   This element is directly rendered as its HTML counterpart.

6.9.  <back>

   This element does not add any direct output to HTML.

6.10.  <bcp14>

   This element marks up words like MUST and SHOULD with an HTML <span>
   element with the CSS class "bcp14".

   You <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> be joking.

6.11.  <blockquote>

   This element renders as the similar HTML <blockquote> element.  If
   there is a "cite" attribute, it is copied to the HTML cite attribute.
   If there is a "quoteFrom" attribute, it is placed inside a <cite>
   element at the end of the quote, with an <a> element surrounding it
   (if there is a "cite" attribute), linking to the "cite" URL.

   If the blockquote does not contain another element that gets a
   pilcrow (Section 5.9), a pilcrow is added.

   <blockquote id="p-1.2-1"
     cite="http://...">
     <p id="p-1.2-2">Four score and seven years ago our fathers
       brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived
       in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men
       are created equal.

6.48.  <sourcecode>

   This element is rendered in an HTML <pre> with a CSS class of

   class of "lang-" and the type is added.

   If the sourcecode is not inside a <figure> element, a pilcrow

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document contains no actions for IANA

8.  Security Considerations

   Since RFCs are sometimes exchanged outside the normal Web sandboxing
   mechanism (e.g., rsync to a mirror) then loaded from a local file,
   more care must be taken with the HTML than is ordinary on the web.
