         Framework of Visible Light Communications in IoT Networks
                        draft-chkim-vlc-iot-00.txt




Abstract

   The LED-based Visible Light Communication (VLC) has been proposed as
   the IEEE 802.15.7-2011 standard and regarded as a new wireless access
   medium in IoT environment. With this trend, many works have so far
   been made to improve the performance of VLC. However, how to
   effectively integrate VLC services into IoT networks has not been
   studied enough. In this document, we propose a scheme for device
   management and data transport in IoT networks using VLC.
   Specifically, we discuss how to manage VLC transmitters and
   receivers, and to support VLC data transmission in IoT networks. The
   proposed scheme considers uni-directional VLC transmissions from
   transmitter to receivers for delivery of location-based VLC data. The
   backward transmission from VLC receivers will be made by using
   platform server and aggregation agents in the network.

Internet-Draft    Framework of VLC in IoT Networks        October 2018


1. Introduction

   Recently, IoT services have widely been used to improve our daily
   life. For example, with the help of IoT services, people can order
   what they need by pushing a button, or find the location where a fire
   has occurred by aggregating the measured values from sensors through
   the Internet.

   For realizing the IoT, there has been lots of work undertaken on
   wireless communication technologies such as BLE and ZigBee, as well
   as the protocols to support packet delivery, such as CoAP [RFC7252],
   MQTT [MQTT], MQTT-SN [MQTT-SN], and so on. Moreover, there are also
   lots of standards and software to help develop IoT products, as shown
   by the Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF), IoTivity, and oneM2M.

   In the meantime, some industry areas may be subject to location-
   critical jobs and/or limited RF communication environments, such as
   huge factories, airplanes, underground facilities, and so on. Such
   environments need a specialized communication technology. Visible
   Light Communication (VLC), which is defined in the IEEE 802.15.7-2011
   [IEEE_802.15.7-2011], is one of the communication solutions for
   meeting these characteristics. VLC communication is carried out
   between transmitter and receivers using visible light. Based on this
   characteristic, VLC offers no interference to existing RF-based
   communications. Also, it does not require a license to use the
   spectrum of visible light. Moreover, VLC provides accurate location-
   based communication, in contrast to existing low-power communication,
   such as BLE and NFC.

   Nowadays, LED lights are widely spread in our daily life. A great
   deal of work has been done on how to improve the performance of LED-
   based VLC in the physical and MAC layers. The IEEE 802.15.7 group has
   recently standardized Optical Wireless Communications (OWC). However,
   how to effectively integrate VLC services into the IoT network has
   not yet been studied enough. In this paper, we propose a scheme for
   device management and data transport in IoT networks using VLC.
   Specifically, we discuss how to manage VLC devices (VLC transmitters
   and receivers) and support the VLC data transmission in the IoT
   networks based on the oneM2M standard. In the proposed VLC-based IoT
   scheme, we consider the uni-directional VLC transmissions from VLC
   transmitter to VLC receivers for location-based VLC data service. The
   backward transmission from VLC receivers to VLC transmitter will be
   made using the IoT platform server and aggregation agents in the IoT
   network. By implementation and testbed experimentation, we will also
   perform the validation and performance analysis for the proposed
   scheme.

   This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we propose the
   reference network model for the VLC-based IoT scheme and the device
   management and VLC data transport operations in the IoT networks.

2. Proposed VLC-Based IoT Scheme

2.1. Network Reference Model

   For VLC-based IoT networks, we consider the following four types of
   network nodes: Platform Server (PS), Aggregation Agent (AA), VLC
   Transmitter (VT), and VLC Receiver (VR). Figure 1 shows uni-
   directional VLC from VT to VR, in which only downlink VLC
   transmission is allowed from VT to VR, and the uplink or backward
   transmission will be made between VR and AA by using another network
   link, such as WLAN or WPAN.

+----+ Ethernet +----+ WLAN/WPAN +-----------+
| PS |<========>| AA |<=========>|     VT    |
+----+          +----+           |(LED Light)|
                 ##              +-----------+
                  ## WLAN/WPAN    *         *
                   ##            *    VLC    *
                    ##          *             *
                   +------------+      |
                   |     VR     |  VLC |
                   |(IoT Device)|<-----
                   +------------+

                    Figure 1 VLC Communication scenario

   It is noted that most real-world VLC deployments follow the uni-
   directional model displayed in Figure 1, even though the IEEE
   802.15.7-2011 specification defines both bi-directional and uni-
   directional models. This is because the implementation of bi-
   directional VLC requires multiple light sources or more complex MAC
   algorithms. Based on this observation, this paper proposes the VLC-
   based IoT scheme based on the uni-directional VLC model. The bi-
   directional VLC model will be considered for further study.

   Figure 2 shows the network reference model for the VLC-based IoT
   scheme, in which the network entities are classified as Platform
   Server (PS), Aggregation Agent (AA), VLC Transmitter (VT), and VLC
   Receiver (VR). Each network entity provides the following
   functionality:

2.1.1. Platform Server (PS)

   PS performs overall management for all devices, including AAs, VTs,
   and VRs, in the VLC-based IoT network through the operations of
   device initialization, monitoring, and VR handover. PS also controls
   location-specific VLC data (from VT to VR) and service-specific data
   (between AA and VR) by using the data transport operation. PS is
   connected to the Internet.

2.1.2. Aggregation Agent (AA)

   AA manages VT and VR devices locally. It keeps and updates the VT-VR
   mapping information for its attached VT through the device
   initialization, monitoring, and VR handover operations. That is, AA
   can realize the list of VRs that is connected to a specific VT. AA
   also supports the VR service channel with VR, in which AA exchanges
   service data with VR. AA is also used to relay location-specific VLC
   data between PS and VT, and service-specific data between VR and PS.

2.1.3. VLC Transmitter (VT)

   VT controls the LED light. When VT is connected and registered to AA,
   it transmits location-specific data with VLC frames toward VRs.

2.1.4. VLC Receiver (VR)

   VR is a user or sensor device which acts as a VLC receiver. When VR
   receives VLC frames with the location-specific data from VT, it will
   begin the registration with AA. If VR is connected to AA, it may
   request service data from AA, based on the context of the location-
   specific data.

   In Figure 2, there are four types of network links. The link with
   double dash (=) between AA and PS could possibly be Ethernet. The
   link with single dash (-) between AA and PS could be Ethernet or
   WLAN. The link with star (*) illustrates the VLC frames transmitted
   by LED light. The link with at mark (@) indicates the service channel
   between AA and VR. This service channel could be WLAN or WPAN, such
   as ZigBee, BLE, Z-Wave, etc. It is noted in the proposed scheme that
   this service channel is employed to provide the uplink or backward
   communication from VR to AA or PS, as discussed with respect to
   Figure 1.

                          Figure 3 Protocol Stack

   In the figure, PS and AA are connected through Ethernet. Connections
   between AA and VT can be established through Ethernet, WLAN, or WPAN.
   6LoWPAN may be used between AA and VT, depending on the underlying
   link, such as BLE or ZigBee. Each VT is connected to an AA. PS can
   send location-specific VLC data to each VT via AA.

   In the meantime, VR receives the VLC data frames from VT. This VLC
   data frame can contain location-specific data given by PS. Based on
   this location-specific VLC data, VR establishes the VR service
   channel with AA by using WPAN or WLAN. To further discuss the use of
   location-specific VLC data and the VR service channel, let us take an
   example of the museum service, which consists of a single PS (acting
   as a museum administrator) and many AAs (an AA may be established at
   each floor in the museum). It is assumed that each AA is responsible
   for many VTs, and each VT supports a particular item in the museum
   (e.g., a famous picture). A visitor (user) is equipped with a VR
   device and moves across VTs to see different items. In this example,
   PS can provide each VT with location-specific data (an item
   identifier), and when VR visits the VT, that location-specific
   information (item identifier) is delivered from VT to VR via the VLC
   transmission. Based on the item identifier, VR will establish the
   service channel with AA and download the item (picture) file from the
   AA. In this way, the location-specific VLC data (possibly initiated
   by PS and/or AA) is delivered from VT to VR via the uni-directional

   VLC transmission, and the VR service channel is used between VR and
   AA for uplink or backward data delivery. This is an example for VLC-
   based IoT service, and its extension could be possible, depending on
   the status of VLC deployment and the features of target VLC services.

2.3. Device Management and Data Transport Operation

   In this section, we describe the VLC-based IoT operations, which are
   divided into device initialization and monitoring, VLC data
   transport, and VR handover operations.

2.3.1. Device Initialization

   During device initialization, all devices (AA, VT, and VR) are
   registered with PS. Figure 4 shows the overall steps for device
   initialization.

   Figure 5 shows the AA initialization process between PS and AA, which
   is divided into the IP connection establishment and the AA
   registration to PS. When an AA turns on, it finds the PS by sending a
   Router Solicitation message, as done in a typical IP network. Then,

   PS responds to AA with a Router Advertisement. The Router
   Advertisement message contains the IP address of PS, including
   information related to the Domain Name System (DNS) server and the
   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server, if available. In
   certain cases, PS may send the Router Advertisement messages
   periodically. AA configures an IPv6 address after receiving the
   Router Advertisement message. When the address configuration is
   completed, AA sends the AA Registration message to PS. After the
   processing of appropriate operations based on the AA Registration, PS
   will reply with the AA Registration ACK message. If necessary, PS may
   send the AA Network Configuration commands to the AA so as to provide
   the information required for configuration of VR Service Channel at
   AA. Processes 3 to 6 are accomplished at the application level.

                        Figure 5 AA Initialization

   Figure 6 shows the VT initialization process, which is divided into
   IP connection establishment and VT registration to AA. Because VT is
   a lighting device with VLC functionality, when VT is powered on, it
   operates as a normal light bulb. It is noted that our scheme could
   also be used for control of a light bulb, such as switching the light
   on or off or changing dimming rates. After being powered on, VT is
   connected to an AA by sending a Router Solicitation message and
   receiving a Router Advertisement message from AA. When VT receives a
   Router Advertisement message, it configures an IPv6 address to
   communicate with AA. After that, VT sends the VT Registration message
   to AA, which may contain the VT identifier and status information on
   the attached LED light. For VLC device management, AA needs to manage
   the mapping information on its downstream VTs and VRs. For this

   purpose, AA creates and maintains a AA-VT-VR mapping table  , and it
   will report this mapping information to PS. Now, AA responds to VT
   with the VT Registration ACK message. If necessary, AA sends the VLC
   Configuration message to the registered VT, which contains the
   parameters required for VLC configuration. Then, the VT configures
   its VLC function and starts to transmit VLC beacons toward the
   promising VRs. It is noted that processes 3 to 8 are done at the
   application level.

                        Figure 6 VT Initialization

   Figure 7 shows the VR initialization process. When VR is turned on,
   it waits to receive any VLC frames. Once a VLC Frame is received, VR
   decodes the VLC frame and tries to establish the VR Service Channel
   with the associated AA. After associating VR Service Channel, VR
   configures an IPv6 address to communicate with AA, exchanging Router
   Solicitation and Router Advertisement messages. When an IPv6 address
   is configured, VR tries to register with AA by sending VR
   Registration message. AA updates the AA-VT-VR mapping table created
   before and replies to VR with a VR Registration ACK message. After VR
   registration is completed, AA reports the new VR to PS by sending the
   mapping table. Steps 3 to 8 are done at the application level. Figure
   8 gives an example of the VLC format and how fields in the VLC frame
   are used for the VR initialization operation. The VLC frame contains

   the start and end preamble for distinguishing VLC frames. AA ID and
   VT ID will be used for VR registration, device monitoring, and VLC
   data transport. In addition, the information on VR Service Channel
   can be defined. For example, when WLAN is used between VR and AA, the
   Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID) of Access Point (AP) for AA may
   be included as the information of VR Service Channel. The
   authorization of VR Service Channel may be added when access control
   from unauthorized requests is needed. Both fields are related to
   associating VR Service Channel with AA. A checksum field may be
   included for checking the validity of the received VLC frame.

2.3.2. Device Monitoring

   Device monitoring is used for PS to keep track of the status of the
   AA, VT, and VR devices in the network. Figure 9 shows the device
   monitoring operations, in which the VT and VR devices periodically
   report the status to AA, and AA sends aggregate status information to
   PS.

   As shown in the figure, AA always keep the AA-VT-VR mapping table for
   device monitoring. VT and VR may use a timer for periodic reporting
   (e.g., every 10 s). Such a report message contains the identifiers of
   the concerned VT and VR. On reception of the reports from VT and VR,


Kim, et al.            Expires April 18, 2019                [Page 13]

   AA will update its AA-VT-VR mapping table. Then, AA also reports the
   aggregate status information to PS periodically (e.g., every 30 s).
   It is noted that an appropriate timer value may be configured,
   depending on the network deployment and the service features to be
   considered.

2.3.3. VLC Data Transport

   In the proposed scheme, the VR data is classified into the following
   two types. One is location-specific data, which is contained in the
   VLC frames that VT transmits to VRs. The other one is service data,
   which is delivered through the VR service channel between AA and VR.

   Figure 10 shows the data transport operations, in which VR receives
   location-specific data from VT and service-specific data is exchanged
   between AA and VR. For the example of the museum service, the VR
   device may be used to give detailed information on the concerned
   exhibition item (e.g., description on the item) to the visiting user.
   In this case, the location-specific data contains the IDs of AA and
   VT, the channel number of the target item, etc. Please note that such
   information is specific to a particular VT or item. The VR device
   might be a smartphone with a mobile guide application for the museum,
   or a dedicated device that is given by the museum. Based on the
   location-specific data, VR will try to get more detailed and
   additional information on the target item from AA, which is served by
   the service data of VR Service Channel.

2.3.4. VR Handover

   If VR is a mobile device, it may move around and across different VTs
   in the network. When a VR moves to another VT, VR performs the
   handover operation, as described in Figure 11. VR will detect a
   handover event if it receives a new VLC frame from a different VT.
   When the handover event is detected, VR sends a VR Handover Report
   message to AA. The message contains the identifiers of old and new
   VTs. If AA receives the handover report, it will update the AA-VT-VR
   mapping table, and send a report to PS. After that, AA responds to VR
   with a VR Handover ACK message through the VR Service Channel.

3. Security Considerations

   The VLC Frame contains the information related to VR Service Channel
   and which is not encrypted. An unknown VR can receive and process the
   VLC Frame knows how to access the Service Channel. This may lead
   information leak. This issue can be resolved by encrypting VLC Frame
   or access control from the AA.
