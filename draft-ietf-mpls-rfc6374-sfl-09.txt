Abstract

   RFC 6374 describes methods of making loss and delay measurements on
   Label Switched Paths (LSPs) primarily as used in MPLS Transport
   Profile (MPLS-TP) networks.  This document describes a method of
   making RFC 6374 performance measurements on flows carried over
   general MPLS LSPs.  In particular, it extends the technique to allow
   loss and delay measurements to be made on multi-point to point LSPs
   and introduces some additional techniques to allow more sophisticated
   measurements to be made in both MPLS-TP and general MPLS networks.

Internet-Draft                 RFC6374-SFL                 February 2021


1.  Introduction

   [RFC6374] was originally designed for use as an OAM protocol for use
   with MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) [RFC5921] LSPs.  MPLS-TP only
   supports point-to-point and point-to-multi-point LSPs.  This document
   describes how to use RFC6374 in the general MPLS case, and also
   introduces a number of more sophisticated measurements of
   applicability to both cases.

   [RFC8372] describes the requirement for introducing flow identities
   when using RFC6374 [RFC6374] packet Loss Measurements (LM).  In
   summary RFC6374 uses the loss-measurement (LM) packet as the packet
   accounting demarcation point.  Unfortunately this gives rise to a
   number of problems that may lead to significant packet accounting
   errors in certain situations.  For example:

   1.  Where a flow is subjected to Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP)
       treatment packets can arrive out of order with respect to the LM
       packet.

   2.  Where a flow is subjected to ECMP treatment, packets can arrive
       at different hardware interfaces, thus requiring reception of an
       LM packet on one interface to trigger a packet accounting action
       on a different interface which may not be co-located with it.
       This is a difficult technical problem to address with the
       required degree of accuracy.

   3.  Even where there is no ECMP (for example on RSVP-TE, MPLS-TP LSPs
       and PWs) local processing may be distributed over a number of
       processor cores, leading to synchronization problems.

   4.  Link aggregation techniques [RFC7190] may also lead to
       synchronization issues.

   5.  Some forwarder implementations have a long pipeline between
       processing a packet and incrementing the associated counter,
       again leading to synchronization difficulties.

   An approach to mitigating these synchronization issue is described in
   [RFC8321] in which packets are batched by the sender and each batch
   is marked in some way such that adjacent batches can be easily
   recognized by the receiver.

   An additional problem arises where the LSP is a multi-point to point
   LSP, since MPLS does not include a source address in the packet.
   Network management operations require the measurement of packet loss
   between a source and destination.  It is thus necessary to introduce

   some source specific information into the packet to identify packet
   batches from a specific source.

   [RFC8957] describes a method of encoding per flow instructions in an
   MPLS label stack using a technique called Synonymous Flow Labels
   (SFL) in which labels which mimic the behavior of other labels
   provide the packet batch identifiers and enable the per batch packet
   accounting.  This memo specifies how SFLs are used to perform RFC6374
   packet loss and RFC6374 delay measurements.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  RFC6374 Packet Loss Measurement with SFL

   The data service packets of the flow being instrumented are grouped
   into batches, and all the packets within a batch are marked with the
   SFL [RFC8372] corresponding to that batch.  The sender counts the
   number of packets in the batch.  When the batch has completed and the
   sender is confident that all of the packets in that batch will have
   been received, the sender issues an RFC6374 Query message to
   determine the number actually received and hence the number of
   packets lost.  The RFC6374 Query message is sent using the same SFL
   as the corresponding batch of data service packets.  The format of
   the Query and Response packets is described in Section 9.

4.  RFC6374 Single Packet Delay Measurement

   RFC6374 describes how to measure the packet delay by measuring the
   transit time of an RFC6374 packet over an LSP.  Such a packet may not
   need to be carried over an SFL since the delay over a particular LSP
   should be a function of the Traffic Class (TC) bits.

   However, where SFLs are being used to monitor packet loss or where
   label inferred scheduling is used [RFC3270] then the SFL would be
   REQUIRED to ensure that the RFC6374 packet which was being used as a
   proxy for a data service packet experienced a representative delay.
   The format of an RFC6374 packet carried over the LSP using an SFL is
   shown in Section 9.

5.  Data Service Packet Delay Measurement

   Where it is desired to more thoroughly instrument a packet flow and
   to determine the delay of a number of packets it is undesirable to
   send a large number of RFC6374 packets acting as a proxy data service
   packets (see Section 4).  A method of directly measuring the delay
   characteristics of a batch of packets is therefore needed.

   Given the long intervals over which it is necessary to measure packet
   loss, it is not necessarily the case that the batch times for the two
   measurement types would be identical.  Thus, it is proposed that the
   two measurements are made relatively independent from each other.
   The notion that they are relatively independent arises from the
   potential for the two batches to overlap in time, in which case
   either the delay batch time will need to be cut short or the loss
   time will need to be extended to allow correct reconciliation of the
   various counters.

   The problem is illustrated in Figure 1 below:

   (1) AAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBBAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBB

    SFL Marking of a packet batch for loss measurement

   (2) AADDDDAAAABBBBBBBBBBAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBB

    SFL Marking of a subset if the packets for delay

   (3) AAAAAAAADDDDBBBBBBBBAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBB

    SFL Marking of a subset of the packets across a
    packet loss measurement boundary

   (4) AACDCDCDAABBBBBBBBBBAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBB

    The case of multiple delay measurements within
    a packet loss measurement

                  Figure 1: RFC6734 Query Packet with SFL

   In case 1 of Figure 1 we show the case where loss measurement alone
   is being carried out on the flow under analysis.  For illustrative
   purposes consider that 10 packets are used in each flow in the time
   interval being analyzed.

   Now consider case 2 of Figure 1 where a small batch of packets need
   to analyzed for delay.  These are marked with a different SFL type
   indicating that they are to be monitored for both loss and delay.

Internet-Draft                 RFC6374-SFL                 February 2021


   The SFL=A indicates loss batch A, SFL=D indicates a batch of packets
   that are to be instrumented for delay, but SFL D is synonymous with
   SFL A, which in turn is synonymous with the underlying Forwarding
   Equivalence Class (FEC).  Thus, a packet marked D will be accumulated
   into the A loss batch, into the delay statistics and will be
   forwarded as normal.  Whether the packet is actually counted twice
   (for loss and delay) or whether the two counters are reconciled
   during reporting is a local matter.

   Now consider case 3 of Figure 1 where a small batch of packets are
   marked for delay across a loss batch boundary.  These packets need to
   considered as part of batch A or a part of batch B, and any RFC6374
   Query needs to take place after all the packets A or D (whichever
   option is chosen) have arrived at the receiving LSR.

   Now consider case 4 of Figure 1.  Here we have a case where it is
   required to take a number of delay measurements within a batch of
   packets that we are measuring for loss.  To do this we need two SFLs
   for delay (C and D) and alternate between them (on a delay batch by
   delay batch basis) for the purposes of measuring the delay
   characteristics of the different batches of packets.

6.  Some Simplifying Rules

   It is possible to construct a large set of overlapping measurement
   types, in terms of loss, delay, loss and delay and batch overlap.  If
   we allow all combinations of cases, this leads to configuration,
   testing and implementation complexity and hence increased costs.  The
   following simplifying rules represent the default case:

   1.  Any system that needs to measure delay MUST be able to measure
       loss.

   2.  Any system that is to measure delay MUST be configured to measure
       loss.  Whether the loss statistics are collected or not is a
       local matter.

   3.  A delay measurement MAY start at any point during a loss
       measurement batch, subject to rule 4.

   4.  A delay measurement interval MUST be short enough that it will
       complete before the enclosing loss batch completes.

   5.  The duration of a second delay (D in Figure 1 batch must be such
       that all packets from the packets belonging to a first delay
       batch (C in Figure 1)will have been received before the second
       delay batch completes.

Internet-Draft                 RFC6374-SFL                 February 2021


   Given that the sender controls both the start and duration of a loss
   and a delay packet batch, these rules are readily implemented in the
   control plane.

7.  Multiple Packet Delay Characteristics

   A number of methods are described which add to the set of
   measurements originally specified in [RFC6374].  Each of these
   methods has different characteristics and different processing
   demands on the packet forwarder.  The choice of method will depend on
   the type of diagnostic that the operator seeks.

   Three Methods are discussed:

   1.  Time Buckets

   2.  Classic Standard Deviation

   3.  Average Delay

7.1.  Method 1: Time Buckets

   In this method the receiving LSR measures the inter-packet gap,
   classifies the delay into a number of delay buckets and records the
   number of packets in each bucket.  As an example, if the operator
   were concerned about packets with a delay of up to 1us, 2us, 4us,
   8us, and over 8us then there would be five buckets and packets that
   arrived up to 1us would cause the 1us bucket counter to increase,
   between 1us and 2us the 2us bucket counter would increase etc.  In
   practice it might be better in terms of processing and potential
   parallelism if, when a packet had a delay relative to its predecessor
   of 2us, then both the up to 1us and the 2us counter were incremented,
   and any more detailed information was calculated in the analytics
   system.

   This method allows the operator to see more structure in the jitter
   characteristics than simply measuring the average jitter, and avoids
   the complication of needing to perform a per packet multiply, but
   will probably need to time intervals between buckets to be
   programmable by the operator.

   The packet format of an RFC6374 Time Bucket Jitter Measurement
   Message is shown below:

   The Version, Flags, Control Code, Message Length, QTF, RTF, RPTF,
   Session Identifier, and DS Fields are as defined in section 3.2 of
   RFC6374.  The remaining fields, which are unsigned integers, are as
   follows:

   o Number of Buckets in the measurement

   o Reserved must be sent as zero and ignored on receipt

   o Interval in 10ns units is the inter-packet interval for
     this bucket

   o Number Pkts in Bucket is the number of packets found in
     this bucket.

   There will be a number of Interval/Number pairs depending on the
   number of buckets being specified by the Querier.  If an RFC6374
   message is being used to configure the buckets, (i.e. the responder
   is creating or modifying the buckets according to the intervals in
   the Query message), then the Responder MUST respond with 0 packets in
   each bucket until it has been configured for a full measurement

   period.  This indicates that it was configured at the time of the
   last response message, and thus the response is valid for the whole
   interval.  As per the [RFC6374] convention the Number of pkts in
   Bucket fields are included in the Query message and set to zero.

   Out of band configuration is permitted by this mode of operation.

   Note this is a departure from the normal fixed format used in
   RFC6374.

   This RFC6374 message is carried over an LSP in the way described in
   [RFC6374] and over an LSP with an SFL as described in Section 9.

7.2.  Method 2 Classic Standard Deviation

   In this method, provision is made for reporting the following delay
   characteristics:

   1.  Number of packets in the batch (n).

   2.  Sum of delays in a batch (S)

   3.  Maximum Delay.

   4.  Minimum Delay.

   5.  Sum of squares of Inter-packet delay (SS).

   Characteristics 1 and 2 give the mean delay.  Measuring the delay of
   each pair in the batch is discussed in Section 7.3.

   Characteristics 3 and 4 give the outliers.

   Characteristics 1, 2 and 5 can be used to calculate the variance of
   the inter-packet gap and hence the standard deviation giving a view
   of the distribution of packet delays and hence the jitter.  The
   equation for the variance (var) is given by:

   var = (SS - S*S/n)/(n-1)

   There is some concern over the use of this algorithm for measuring
   variance, because SS and S*S/n can be similar numbers, particularly
   where variance is low.  However the method commends it self by not
   requiring a division in the hardware.

Internet-Draft                 RFC6374-SFL                 February 2021


   o Number of Packets is the number of packets in this batch

   o Sum of Delays for Batch is the duration of the batch in the
     time measurement format specified in the RTF field.

   o Minimum Delay is the minimum inter-packet gap observed during
     the batch in the time format specified in the RTF field.

   o Maximum Delay is the maximum inter-packet gap observed during
     the batch in the time format specified in the RTF field.

   This RFC6374 message is carried over an LSP in the way described in
   [RFC6374] and over an LSP with an SFL as described in Section 9.

7.3.  Per Packet Delay Measurement

   If detailed packet delay measurement is required then it might be
   possible to record the inter-packet gap for each packet pair.  In
   other than exception cases of slow flows or small batch sizes, this
   would create a large (per packet) demand on storage in the
   instrumentation system, a large bandwidth to such a storage system
   and large bandwidth to the analytics system.  Such a measurement
   technique is outside the scope of this document.

7.4.  Average Delay

   Introduced in [RFC8321] is the concept of a one way delay measurement
   in which the average time of arrival of a set of packets is measured.
   In this approach the packet is time-stamped at arrival and the
   Responder returns the sum of the time-stamps and the number of times-
   tamps.  From this the analytics engine can determine the mean delay.
   An alternative model is that the Responder returns the time stamp of
   the first and last packet and the number of packets.  This method has
   the advantage of allowing the average delay to be determined at a
   number of points along the packet path and allowing the components of
   the delay to be characterized.

   The packet format of an RFC6374 Average Delay Measurement Message is
   shown below:

8.  Sampled Measurement

   In the discussion so far it has been assumed that we would measure
   the delay characteristics of every packet in a delay measurement
   interval defined by an SFL of constant color.  In [RFC8321] the
   concept of a sampled measurement is considered.  That is the
   Responder only measures a packet at the start of a group of packets
   being marked for delay measurement by a particular color, rather than
   every packet in the marked batch.  A measurement interval is not
   defined by the duration of a marked batch of packets but the interval
   between a pair of RFC6374 packets taking a readout of the delay
   characteristic.  This approach has the advantage that the measurement
   is not impacted by ECMP effects.

9.  Carrying RFC6374 Packets over an LSP using an SFL

   The packet format of an RFC6374 Query message using SFLs is shown in
   Figure 5.

                  Figure 5: RFC6734 Query Packet with SFL

   The MPLS label stack is exactly the same as that used for the user
   data service packets being instrumented except for the inclusion of
   the Generic Associated Channel Label (GAL) [RFC5586] to allow the
   receiver to distinguish between normal data packets and OAM packets.
   Since the packet loss measurements are being made on the data service
   packets, an RFC6374 direct loss measurement is being made, and which
   is indicated by the type field in the ACH (Type = 0x000A).

Internet-Draft                 RFC6374-SFL                 February 2021


   The RFC6374 measurement message consists of the three components, the
   RFC6374 fixed header as specified in [RFC6374] carried over the ACH
   channel type specified the type of measurement being made (currently:
   loss, delay or loss and delay) as specified in RFC6374.

   Two optional TLVs MAY also be carried if needed.  The first is the
   SFL TLV specified in Section 9.1.  This is used to provide the
   implementation with a reminder of the SFL that was used to carry the
   RFC6374 message.  This is needed because a number of MPLS
   implementations do not provide the MPLS label stack to the MPLS OAM
   handler.  This TLV is required if RFC6374 messages are sent over UDP
   [RFC7876].  This TLV MUST be included unless, by some method outside
   the scope of this document, it is known that this information is not
   needed by the RFC6374 Responder.

   The second set of information that may be needed is the return
   information that allows the responder send the RFC6374 response to
   the Querier.  This is not needed if the response is requested in-band
   and the MPLS construct being measured is a point to point LSP, but
   otherwise MUST be carried.  The return address TLV is defined in
   RFC6378 and the optional UDP Return Object is defined in [RFC7876].

9.1.  RFC6374 SFL TLV

   The required RFC6374 SFL TLV is shown in Figure 6.  This contains the
   SFL that was carried in the label stack, the FEC that was used to
   allocate the SFL and the index into the batch of SLs that were
   allocated for the FEC that corresponds to this SFL.

   Type      Type is set to Synonymous Flow Label (SFL-TLV).

   Length    The length of the TLV as specified in RFC6374.

   MBZ       MUST be sent as zero and ignored on receive.

   SFL Batch The SFL batch that this SFL was allocated as part
             of see [I-D.bryant-mpls-sfl-control]

   SPL Index The index into the list of SFLs that were assigned
             against the FEC that corresponds to the SFL.

             Multiple SFLs can be assigned to a FEC each
             with different actions. This index is an optional
             convenience for use in mapping between the TLV
             and the associated data structures in the LSRs.

   SFL       The SFL used to deliver this packet.  This is an MPLS
             label which is a component of a label stack entry as
             defined in Section 2.1 of [RFC3032].

   Reserved  MUST be sent as zero and ignored on receive.

   FEC       The Forwarding Equivalence Class that was used to
             request this SFL.  This is encoded as per
             Section 3.4.1 of [RFC5036]

   This information is needed to allow for operation with hardware that
   discards the MPLS label stack before passing the remainder of the
   stack to the OAM handler.  By providing both the SFL and the FEC plus
   index into the array of allocated SFLs a number of implementation
   types are supported.

10.  RFC6374 Combined Loss-Delay Measurement

   This mode of operation is not currently supported by this
   specification.

11.  Privacy Considerations

   The inclusion of originating and/or flow information in a packet
   provides more identity information and hence potentially degrades the
   privacy of the communication.  Whilst the inclusion of the additional
   granularity does allow greater insight into the flow characteristics
   it does not specifically identify which node originated the packet
   other than by inspection of the network at the point of ingress, or
   inspection of the control protocol packets.  This privacy threat may
   be mitigated by encrypting the control protocol packets, regularly

   changing the synonymous labels and by concurrently using a number of
   such labels.

12.  Security Considerations

   The issue noted in Section 11 is a security consideration.  There are
   no other new security issues associated with the MPLS dataplane.  Any
   control protocol used to request SFLs will need to ensure the
   legitimacy of the request.1

13.  IANA Considerations

13.1.  Allocation of MPLS Generalized Associated Channel (G-ACh) Types

   As per the IANA considerations in [RFC5586], IANA is requested to
   allocate the following codeponts in the "MPLS Generalized Associated
   Channel (G-ACh) Type" registry, in the "Generic Associated Channel
   (G-ACh) Parameters" name space:

   Value  Description                            TLV Follows  Reference
   -----  ---------------------------------      -----------  ---------
   TBD    RFC6374 Time Bucket Jitter Measurement No           This


   TBD    RFC6374 Multi-Packet Delay             No           This
          Measurement

   TBD    RFC6374 Average Delay Measurement      No           This

13.2.  Allocation of MPLS Loss/Delay TLV Object

   IANA is requested to allocate a new TLV from the 0-127 range of the
   MPLS Loss/Delay Measurement TLV Object Registry in the "Generic
   Associated Channel (G-ACh) Parameters" namespace:

     Type Description                       Reference
     ---- --------------------------------- ---------
     TBD  Synonymous Flow Label             This

   A value of 4 is recommended.
