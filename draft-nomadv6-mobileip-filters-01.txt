   Abstract 
    
   Filters for Mobile IPv6 Bindings (NOMADv6) introduces a set of 
   extensions for MIPv6 protocol that allows the intelligent use of 
   multiple points of attachment simultaneously, on a mobile node.  It 
   specifies a set of rules (filters) that are transmitted to binding 
   agents, who in turn use this information to determine whether and 
   where to route flows associated with the mobile node. In this manner, 
   it is possible for a mobile node to distribute flows or packets of a 
   flow among its available points of attachment or to request that such 
   flow is dropped before traversing the Internet fabric, with or 
   without notification to their source. These extensions mirror a 
   similar extension defined for Mobile IPv4 (NOMADv4) but has been 
   extended to cater to the behavior of IPv6.

   Internet Draft     Filters for Mobile IPv6 Bindings    October 2003 
    
1.Introduction 
    
   This document extends Mobile IPv6 protocol, introducing a set of 
   rules (called filters) that are transmitted with the binding update 
   by the mobile node. When receiving the binding update with filters, 
   the binding agent (Mobile IPv6 entities that can maintain bindings, 
   HA, CN, MAP) route flows associated with the mobile node, based on 
   these rules. This draft enables a mobile node to use its active 
   points of attachment simultaneously and efficiently.  
     
   In a filter enabled environment, a mobile node MAY include in its 
   binding update, a list of filters as mobility options. Flows that 
   match the conditions listed in the filters are associated with the  
   care-of-addresses as specified in the binding update. In this manner, 
   binding agent becomes aware of the relationship between certain flows 
   and specific bindings. The binding agent, which maintain these 
   relationships and acts on them, is called a filtering agent. Flows 
   intercepted by, or originating from a Filtering Agent (HA, CN, MAP) 
   will be filtered and individual flows will be handled as indicated by 
   the control information of the Filter. In the most typical scenario, 
   individual flows will be redirected to the care-of address indicated 
   by the respective binding. This enables mobile nodes to distribute 
   flows or to distribute packets of a single flow, among their 
   available points of attachment. Alternatively, the mobile node may 
   request when registering bindings and filters that it does not wish 
   to receive certain flows (it wishes to have them dropped, with or 
   without notification to source). 
    
   Mobile IPv6 draft [3] does not consider catering for multiple points 
   of attachment with single home address as in Mobile IPv4 [6]. This is 
   not considered mainly due to the duplication of each packet to the 
   available active points of attachment when the mobile node has a 
   single home address, as specified in [6]. The advantage of using 
   single home address compared to multiple homing is that the mobile 
   node is addressable by one single address and thereby, is able to 
   maintain continuity of communication, when moving flows to any active 
   point of attachment.  
    
   This draft introduces the mechanism of avoiding IP packet duplication 
   and enabling the mobile node to select its point of attachment 
   intelligently, while using a single home address for multiple active 
   points of attachment and also the redirection of flows among multiple 
   home addresses.  
     
   This draft introduces the `N³ bit to the binding update mobility 
   header.  This bit, when set, informs the filtering agent to hold 
   multiple simultaneous binding for the given home address of the 
   mobile node and then manipulate the IP traffic based on the filtering 
   rules sent as mobility options.   
    
   The operation of filtering for Mobile IPv6 is intended to mirror the 
   operation of filtering for Mobile IPv4 [2], with changes necessary to 
   provide a similar behavior. The considerations presented in this 
   document are collectively referred to as the NOMADv6 Extensions.

3.Comparison with Filters for Mobile IPv4 (NOMADv4 vs NOMADv6) 
    
   a. In MIPv6, there are no dedicated FAs, GFAs, or RFAs. The roles of 
   these entities have been taken over by the particular routers, which 
   are located along the path which a packet traverses from the HA to 
   the MN or CN to MN. These special routers are called MAPs. Therefore, 
   in an MIPv6 environment, MN destined packet filtering SHOULD be done 
   by an HA, CN or an MAP. 
    
   b. Mobile IPv6 route optimization can be deployed on a global scale 
   between all mobile nodes and correspondent nodes. Therefore, CN can 
   act also as a filtering agent, similar to an HA. A Filtering 
   extension of routing optimization of simultaneous bindings is not 
   required in MIPv6 as the mobile node sends binding to CN similar to 
   the normal binding to HA. All the other filtering rules defined in 
   NOMADv4[2] are applicable here, with changes required for IPv6.   
    
   d. Multiple simultaneous bindings are not specified in the MIPv6 
   protocol, as in the MIPv4 protocol [6]. The S bit in MIPv4 
   registration request informs the binding agent to keep existing 
   bindings for the same home address, when updating the binding list 
   with the new care-of-address. The filtering concept described in this 
   draft MUST require that all binding agents are able to cater for

   simultaneous bindings. The new flag called ôNö is introduced to the 
   binding update mobility header to hold simultaneous bindings in 
   NOMADv6. 
    
   e. Sub types of the Filter extensions are defined on the first byte 
   of the Data field in NOMADv6. NOMADv4 uses standard short and long 
   TLV format as defined in [6] for including sub types. 
    
    
4 NOMADv6 Protocol Overview 
    
   This section provides an overview of how filters for MIPv6 bindings 
   can be realized. 
    
4.1 Protocol Description 
    
 4.1.1 Multiple network interface support and N bit 
    
   Filters for Mobile IPv6 is applicable only in the context of the 
   mobile node having multiple points of attachment to the Internet. 
   These attachments MAY have one single home agent or multiple home 
   agents or a combination between these two. In the first case, each 
   network interface of the mobile node, will have the same home address 
   or MAY have multiple home addresses with the same home agent. In 
   latter cases, each interface will have it³s own home address or 
   again, a combination of single home address and multiple home 
   addresses.  
    
   The `N³ bit, which has been introduced in this draft, provides the 
   major task of informing the binding agent about the actions to be 
   taken for the filters attached in an incoming binding update.  The 
   secondary task of the `N³ bit is to inform the binding agent to hold 
   multiple bindings for the same home address. In the latter case, the 
   binding agent MUST keep a new entry without deleting the existing 
   entries for the mobile node³s home address specified in the home 
   address destination option.  
    
   The format of the Message Data field in the binding update mobility 
   header is as follows [3]:  
    
                                  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
                                  |Sequence #                     | 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
  |A|H|K||L|N|     Reserved       |           Lifetime            | 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   N    When set, the binding agent MUST act based on the functions 
        described in this draft (4.1.3) and to add this entry to the 
        binding cache without deleting any existing entries for the 
        mobile node³s home address which is specified in the home 
        address destination option.

 4.1.2 Sending Filtering Rules 
    
   Mobile nodes that wish to associate Filters with an acquired care-of 
   address are required to issue a binding update including a list of 
   Filters that indicate which flows are associated with the registered 
   care-of-address. Such signaling is termed as Filtering Updates. A 
   Filter is consisted of one or more Filter Modules and is terminated 
   by a Filter Control Extension. A Filter Module may contain several 
   predicates. There is an OR relationship between predicates of a 
   Filter Module. Moreover, there is an AND relationship between Filter 
   Modules of the same Filter. Consequently, in order for a flow to 
   match a Filter, it is required to qualify for all of the Filter 
   Modules contained in the Filter.  
    
   With the help of the Filter Control Extension, the Filter³s purpose    
   can be defined. It contains the Filter³s Index, and a Weight field. 
   The Index identifies uniquely, a Filter for a given mobile node while 
   the Weight field indicates the relative amount of traffic for which 
   the filter is applicable. If the Weight field is set to zero, then 
   all matching flows will be dropped without notification to their 
   source.  
    
   A mobile node may define more than one Filter for a specific mobility 
   binding. The declaration of these Filters may take place during one 
   or more Filtering Updates. In the case of shared Filters, packets of 
   matching flows will get distributed between multiple points of 
   attachment with respect to the Weight value of each filter. A mobile 
   node may share a Filter between mobility bindings by issuing a 
   Filtering Request from each respective point of attachment. The first 
   one will contain the full Filter (Filter Body + Filter Control 
   Extension) while all subsequent Filtering Requests will contain only 
   a Filter Control Extension indicating the Index number of the Filter 
   to be shared.  
    
   Flows that fail to match any of the defined Filters are handled as 
   defined by the Filter with the lowest possible Index of zero, termed  
   as Default Filter. A mobile node may define some of the attributes  
   of the Default Filter such as the associated mobility binding and  
   its Weight field by issuing a Filtering Request. Otherwise, these  
   will be configured by each Filtering Agent (4.1.3).  
    
   When a mobile node needs to delete filters, it sends the Filtering 
   Update only with the Filter Control Extension. The index of the 
   filter to be deleted should be send in the index field. If a mobile 
   node wishes to delete all filters, index should be set to 255. 
    
   All the filtering rules which have to be set in the mobility options 
   of a binding update will be described in the section 7.1. The rules 
   by which a mobile node decides on the set of Filters are considered 
   beyond the scope of this document. The extensions presented in this 
   document do not affect in any way the mobile node³s choice on the 
   point of attachment to be used when returning traffic.

 4.1.3 Processing at the Filtering Agent 
    
   Filtering Updates will be processed by one or more Filtering Agents.   
   A Filtering Agent can be any Mobile IPv6 entity that can maintain 
   mobility bindings with Filters, like a HA, CN or MAP.    
    
   Flows that fail to match any of the defined Filters are handled as  
   defined by the Default Filter. If a mobile node fails to promptly   
   define a Default Filter or if the associated mobility binding expires 
   then a new one will automatically be configured by each involved 
   Filtering Agent to the lowest possible Index of 0.  
    
   Different Filtering Agents may apply different Default Filter 
   definitions, however it is recommended that the Default Filter be   
   associated with the mobility binding with the longest outstanding   
   lifetime with the Weight field set to 1.  
    
   A mobile node may issue Filters corresponding to flows that do not    
   yet exist. When such a flow is initiated it will be handled by the    
   Filtering Agents as indicated by the respective Filter.  
    
   A Filtering Acknowledgement contains one or more Filter 
   Acknowledgment Extensions indicating the Index of a Filter along with 
   a Code signifying the result of the respective Filtering Update. The 
   Code is used to relay success or the reason of rejection to the 
   mobile node. 
    
   If a mobile node sends a binding update without setting a N bit, a 
   Filtering agent should act as per [3] to ignore the behavior 
   presented in this document. A mobility binding in that state is 
   termed as an Idle Mobility Binding.  
    
 4.1.4 Lifetime of the filter 
    
   A Filter remains valid for the lifetime of the corresponding mobility 
   binding. If the lifetime of a binding expires or it is cancelled by 
   the registration of another mobility binding then all associated 
   Filters are deleted from the binding cache.  
    
   When renewing mobility binding, a mobile node is not required to 
   include any reference to any requested Filters. A mobile node SHOULD 
   set the N bit on in its Binding Update and then the Filtering Agent 
   SHOULD refresh the lifetime of the binding and all filters, related 
   to the home address sent on the Destination option of the Binding 
   Update.  
    
 4.1.6 Filters that split flows between different home addresses. 
    
   A MN with more than one point of attachment, MAY have different home 
   addresses (multi-homed mobile node) for each of those points of 
   attachment. These addresses MAY be registered with different HAs or 
   with the same HA. In this situation, if MN wishes to split its flows 
   coming to one point of attachment (A) to another (B), MN MUST send a 
   Filtering Update via A, including an alternate CoA mobility option 
   with the CoA of the point of attachment B. The HA of the point of 
   NOMADv6                Expires April 2004                         8 
   Internet Draft     Filters for Mobile IPv6 Bindings    October 2003 
    
   attachment A, upon receival of this binding update, MUST tunnel the 
   matching flows to the CoA of the point of attachment B. If the 
   filtering agent is a CN instead of a HA, then packets will be 
   delivered to the CoA of the point of attachment B using a Type 2 
   Routing Header as stated in [3]. (Refer Fig. 1)  
 
4.2 Model of Operation 
    
   Filters for Mobile IPv6 Bindings has two modes of operation that can  
   be seamlessly combined but for the sake of simplicity are covered in    
   this section separately. The first model of operation concerns the  
   management of whole flows while the second model addresses the 
   distribution of the individual packets of flows between points of 
   attachment. 
    
   The distribution of multiple flows is illustrated in figure 1. It 
   shows a mobile node that maintains multiple access interfaces 
   simultaneously. Each interface provides a point of attachment through 
   a foreign network (FN-A, FN-B and FN-C). The extensions presented do 
   not provide any restriction as to how many points of attachment a 
   mobile node may maintain or how many home agents it can be attached 
   to. For example, the mobile node in figure 1 has two separate points 
   of attachment through FN-A and FN-B, communicating with CN-1 and CN-2 
   via HA-1. In addition, the mobile node maintains another point of 
   attachment through FN-C, corresponding with CN3 via HA2. MN uses one 
   home address (HoA-1) for two interfaces, while the other interface is 
   connected to the HA2 via HoA-2.  
    
   In figure 1, the mobile node maintains five communication sessions 
   with correspondent nodes of CN1, CN2 and CN3. Flows associated with 
   CN1 are denoted by 'a' and CN2 are denoted by 'b' & 'c'  while the 
   respective flows for CN3 are denoted by 'd' and 'e'.  
    
   When MN requires to transfer flows `a³ & `b³ (Filter1) to the 
   interface connected to the FN-A, while receiving all the other flows 
   (Default filter) over FN-B, MN sends a new binding as defined in 
   4.1.2 with N bit set.  
       
   When MN requires transferring flow `d³ to the interface connected to 
   FN-B, MN sends a binding update with HoA-2 and CoA-C, together with 
   CoA-B in the Alternate care-of-address mobility option and with the 
   required filtering extensions (refer 4.1.6). This causes the addition 
   of a new binding entry (HOA-2:CoA-B:Filter1) at HA2. This will not 
   result in any deletion of existing binding entries (HoA-2:CoA-C will 
   remain). HA2, will now intercept all flows (d & e), but will tunnel 
   flow `d³ through FN-B, while flow `e³ or any other flows continues 
   through FN-C.

   Figure 1: A mobile node with three points of attachment in  
   different foreign networks (CoA-A, CoA-B & CoA-C) with 2 home 
   addresses (HoA-1 & HoA-2). Incoming flows are redirected by the 
   respective filtering agents (HA1, HA2) to different care-of-
   addresses, based on the filtering rules. 
    
   In the example presented in figure 1, the HA1 & HA2 act as the 
   filtering agents. But, any Mobile IPv6 binding agent (HA, MAP, CN) 
   can act as filtering agents. To return traffic, a mobile node may 
   choose any of the available points of attachment. 
    
   Figure 2, illustrates the second model of operation. It shows the 
   mobile node that maintains two points of attachment in visited domain 
   A and B, while maintaining one active flow from CN1, denoted with 
   æaÆ. In this example, MN maintains two bindings with the CN1 for 
   visiting domain A and B. NOMADv6 extensions are applied to share a 
   Filter (Flow æaÆ) over point of attachment A and B.

                distributed by the respective Filtering Agents (HA,CN or   
                MAP) to a different care-of address. 
    
    
5 Backword compatibility with basic Mobile IPv6 
    
   If the binding update does not have the N flag set, the processing of 
   the BU is same as [3]. But if the binding agent has already 
   registered multiple care-of addresses for the same home address, the 
   binding agent MUST overwrite all the bindings for the home address 
   specified in the destination option. Binding updates without N flag 
   set are considered as idle mobility bindings. In order to preserve 
   backward compatibility with the basic protocol [3], it is stated in 
   (section 4.1.3) that a Filtering Agent maintaining only idle Mobility 
   Bindings for a mobile is required to act as per [3] and to ignore the 
   behavior presented in this document.  
    
    
6 Associating Filters with Bindings 
    
   This section gives a detailed description of the steps taken by a 
   mobile node that wishes to associate filters with its bindings. 
   Furthermore, it presents how a filtering agent reacts to the receipt 
   of a binding update containing a list of filters. 
    
6.1 Mobile Node Considerations 
    
   A mobile node that acquires a care-of address within a visited domain 
   may issue a Filtering Update containing a list of Filters. All 
   included Filters will be associated with the registered care-of 
   address at all Filtering Agents (HA,CN,MAP). A mobile node that 
   maintains multiple points of attachment may request for simultaneous 
   mobility bindings by setting the 'N' bit on in its Filtering Updates. 
   However, each of the Filtering Updates must contain its own list of 
   NOMADv6                Expires April 2004                        11 
   Internet Draft     Filters for Mobile IPv6 Bindings    October 2003 
    
   filters. Should the Filtering Update be rejected then the mobile node 
   will receive a Filtering Acknowledgement with a Filter 
   Acknowledgement Extension indicating the Index of the Filter that was 
   rejected along with the reason for rejection.  
    
   It is important for a mobile node to keep a record of the Filters    
   and their corresponding Index numbers per home address.  
    
   For the management of Filters eight scenarios are identified. These  
   are presented along with the actions to be undertaken by the mobile  
   node.  
    
 6.1.1 Creating a new mobility binding with Filters  
    
   In order to create a new mobility binding with associated Filters,  
   the mobile node MUST issue a Filtering Update including one or more  
   full Filter definitions (one or more Filter modules with Filter  
   Control Extension) as mobility options, attached to the binding 
   update mobility header. Each of the Filters MUST be allocated a 
   different Index number. 
    
   The destination of the Filtering Update is identified as described  
   in [3].  
    
 6.1.2 Replacing a Filter of a mobility binding by Index  
        
   In order for a mobile node to replace an existing Filter, it is   
   required to issue a Filtering Update with a full definition of the    
   new Filter. The Filter Control Extension of the Filter must indicate  
   the Index of the Filter to be replaced. The Weight value of the new 
   Filter MAY be different from the Weight of the previous Filter 
   definition.  
    
 6.1.3 Adding new Filters to an existing mobility binding  
        
   In order for a mobile node to add new Filters to an existing mobility 
   binding, it is required to act as if creating a new mobility binding 
   with Filters. It is necessary for the new Filter to adopt an 
   unallocated Index number otherwise it would be replacing an existing  
   Filter with that Index.  
    
 6.1.4 Sharing a Filter between mobility binding 
  
   A mobile node may share a Filter between mobility bindings by    
   issuing a Filtering Request from each respective point of   
   attachment. The first one will contain the full Filter (Filter Body    
   + Filter Control Extension) while all subsequent Filtering Requests    
   will contain only a Filter Control Extension indicating the Index    
   number of the Filter to be shared. 
    
 6.1.5 Renewing a mobility binding with Filters  
    
   Periodically, a mobile node is required to renew its mobility 
   bindings in order to extend their lifetime. Renewing a mobility   
   binding may occur as described in [3]. The mobile node sets N bit on, 
   NOMADv6                Expires April 2004                        12 
   Internet Draft     Filters for Mobile IPv6 Bindings    October 2003 
    
   when sending a binding update in order to renew all filters allocated 
   for the home address defined in the destination option.    
    
 6.1.6 Deleting a defined Filter/s for a mobility binding  
    
   In order for a mobile node to delete an existing Filter for a    
   mobility binding, it is required to issue a Filtering Request from  
   any care-of address. The Filtering Request must include a Filter 
   Deletion Extensions indicating the Index of each Filter to be 
   deleted. 
    
 6.1.7 Deleting all Filters for a mobility binding  
    
   In order for a mobile node to delete all existing Filters for a    
   mobility binding, it is required to issue a Filtering Request from  
   any care-of address. The Filtering Request must include a Filter 
   Deletion Extensions with the Index field set to zero. 
    
 6.1.8 Transferring a Filter between mobility bindings  
    
   It is required to act as if creating a new mobility binding with 
   Filters and send out a Filtering Update from the point of attachment 
   to which it wants to transfer the Filter to the other. The Filtering 
   Update must attach the Alternate Care-of-Address mobility option and 
   must contain the full Filter. Alternate care-of-address option 
   contains the care-of-address of the point of attachment, which the 
   filter should be transferred. In this way, the transferring of 
   filters are possible irrespective of the same or different home 
   addresses used for each of attachment.  
    
   The Weight field of the Filter Control Extension indicates the 
   relative amount of traffic for which a Filter is applicable. If the 
   Weight field is set to zero then all matching flows will be dropped 
   without notification to their source. For any other value of Weight, 
   matching flows will get forwarded to  the point of attachment 
   indicated by the corresponding mobility binding. In the case of 
   shared Filters, packets of matching flows will get distributed 
   between multiple points of attachment with respect to the Weight 
   value of each Filter. 
    
6.2 Filtering Agent Considerations 
    
   This section contains considerations for Filtering Agents. These are 
   Mobile IPv6 entities that can maintain mobility bindings such as HAs, 
   CNs or MAPs when hierarchical Mobile IPv6 is supported.  
      
   Should the Filtering Agent fail to apply any of the Filters then for  
   each such Filter a Filter Acknowledgement Extension must be included 
   in the Filtering Acknowledgement indicating the Index of the rejected 
   Filter along with the reason of rejection. If authentication of the 
   Filtering Update fails, then none of the Filters MUST be applied.  
    
   Should the Filtering Agent succeed in applying the Filters, then the 
   Filtering Acknowledgement indicating the index of the success MUST be 
   sent, only if `A³ bit is set on the Binding Update. 
   NOMADv6                Expires April 2004                        13 
   Internet Draft     Filters for Mobile IPv6 Bindings    October 2003 
    
    
   When a Filtering Agent intercepts a packet for a mobile node for   
   which it maintains a mobility binding, it is required to identify   
   whether the packet matches any of the Filters associated with the    
   mobility binding. If so, the packet is handled as described by the 
   Weight value of the corresponding Filter. If no matching Filter is 
   found then the packet is handled as indicated by the Default Filter.  
    
   When a mobility binding expires or is deregistered by a mobile node  
   then all associated Filters are deleted with it. Whenever a Filtering 
   Agent received a Filtering Update without setting the N bit (i.e. 
   Binding Update), it is required to overwrite all the bindings set for 
   the home address and keep the binding for the new care-of-address, 
   sent. This binding is called the Idle Mobility Binding and it is 
   required to ignore the behavior described in this document and to act 
   as per [3]. 
    
    
7 NOMADv6 Extensions to MIPv6 Binding Messages 
    
   In this section, the new Mobile IPv6 extensions required to support 
   the Filters for Mobile IPv6 bindings are specified. 
    
   All filtering extensions are sent as mobility options of the binding 
   update or binding acknowledgment mobility header as defined in [3]. 
   The filtering extensions are encoded using a type-length-value (TLV) 
   format in the mobility options.  
    
   A complete mobility header, once filter extensions are attached 
   SHOULD be an integer multiple of 8 octets long.  
    
   Filter extensions can be categorized into 4 types, 
    
        o Filter Module Extensions 
        o Filter Control Extension 
        o Filter Deletion Extension 
        o Filter Acknowledgement Extension 
    
   The Filter Module Extensions specify the different filtering rules 
   that the mobile node wishes to inform the Filtering Agent. There are 
   10 such filter extensions.  These extensions are always attached to 
   the Binding Update mobility header as mobility option/s. To form a 
   valid Filter, at least one of the filter module extensions must be 
   included. The Filter Control Extension must appear once in every 
   Filter following all Filter Modules. Filter control extension may 
   appear more than once in a binding update interleaving with Filter 
   declarations.  
    
   Filter Modules of the same type may not appear in a Filter more than  
   once. A Filter Module may include one or more predicates. There is an 
   OR relationship between Filter Module predicates. That is, in order 
   for a flow to match a Filter Module, it is required to qualify for 
   any of the predicates in it. In addition, there is an AND 
   relationship between Filter Modules of a Filter. As such, in order  
   for a flow to match a Filter, it is required to qualify for all its  
   NOMADv6                Expires April 2004                        14 
   Internet Draft     Filters for Mobile IPv6 Bindings    October 2003 
    
   Filter Modules. 
    
   In Filter Modules, the first byte of the data is allocated to define 
   the types of the Filter Modules. The left most bit of the Sub-Type 
   field is used to determine whether the rules included in the Filter 
   Module are positive or negative. In the first case, a flow is 
   required to match exactly the predicates included in the Filter 
   Module while in the second the inverted (NOT) rule is applied. 
    
   The Filter Deletion extension is an extension sent to the Filtering 
   Agent by the mobile node to deleted filter/s. This extension is 
   attached to Binding Update mobility header. The Filter 
   Acknowledgement extension is an extension sent to the mobile node by 
   the Filtering Agent to inform of success or any failure of filter 
   accommodation. This extension is attached to Binding Acknowledgement 
   mobility header. 
    
7.1 Filter Module Extensions 
    
 7.1.1 Traffic Class Filter Extension. 
    
   Specifies the extension required to filter IPv6 packets, based on the 
   value placed on the Traffic Class field of a packet. This has an

                        used to invert each predicate of the Filter  
                        Module. Due to this bit, two different Sub-Type  
                        values are given.

   The area indicated by the offset and for a length equivalent to that 
   of Mask is compared against Mask with the bitwise operator AND. The  
   result of this operation is compared against Value. A match would  
   indicate that the packet qualifies the filter. 
                        
   Value and Mask fields MUST have exactly the same size. However, the 
   length of the Value and Mask may vary with every free-form filter.
