Internet-Draft       Multi-path Analysis & Scenarios           July 2009


1.  Introduction

   A Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) consists of a loosely connected group
   of mobile devices (formally routers).  The group means having the
   boundary of the packet reachability.  The mobile devices are equipped
   with homogeneous or heterogeneous multiple network interfaces.  In
   this document, these mobile devices are called by the MANET routers.
   That is, A MANET may be an autonomous and isolated system of MANET
   routers.  MANET routers have methods of IP prefix allocation and
   address autoconfiguration on the multiple interfaces.

   The MANET routers may have multiple mobile hosts over wireless
   communications.  They carry traffic originating at and/or destined
   for mobile hosts.  Even though the mobile hosts being under the
   control of MANET routers are initiators or receivers of packet
   traffic, this document does not consider the mobile hosts .  But, the
   number of mobile hosts, the moving speed of mobile hosts and the QoS
   of application of mobile hosts may be considered to decide the number
   of multiple paths between the MANET routers.  In other words, the
   MANET routers may organize and maintain multiple interfaces which may
   be used to support the multiple paths.  But the MANET WG do not
   discuss the routing protocols which are based on multiple paths.  In
   this document, a routing protocol which attempts to make efficient
   use of multiple Interfaces using existing standard DYMO or OLSRv2 is
   described.

   From now on, the MANET has the connectivities to the fixed network
   (e.g., the public Internet) through the gateway(s).  Many feasible
   application (e.g., vehicle communication) may be required the network
   connection to the Internet.  And also high quality of services should
   be required and supported.  Therefore, this document is focused on
   IPv6 networking and multiple path routing among the MANET routers,
   which are the multiple interfaces with dynamic multiple channels in
   each.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].


3.  Applications using Multiple Path Routing

   The synonymous technologies of MANET networking are Mobile Packet
   Radio Networking, Mobile Mesh Networking and Mobile, Multihop,
   Wireless Networking.  MANET applications are requred to support the

   dynamic ad hoc networking technology.  Herein, the 'dynamic' means
   moderate/high degrees of mobility and the 'ad hoc' means a temporary
   network.  Therefore, the most important things are keeping reliable
   and long-lived routes for MANET applications.

3.1.  Load-balancing and Anti-eavesdropping

   Each MANET router has a single wireless interface.  The MANET routers
   may be spatially distributed and their communication ranges may be
   changed because they move.  Therefore, all routers might communicate
   through one or more intermediate routers

   The MANET networks are more vulnerable.  The eavesdropping on packet
   communciations is easy if intermediate routers are only attacked.  If
   the traffic is dispersed by using MANET routers with multiple
   interfaces, the load-balancing service is supported and in the same
   time the probability of eavesdropping may be decreased.

3.2.  The stable and reliable wireless backbones in Mobile Mesh Networks

   The Mobile Mesh networks are used as the wireless backbone to replace
   wired backbone.  The mesh networks might be used as 'transit
   networks'.  That is, they are normally used to support the last mile
   communication services to home network, city network, etc.  But the
   mobile feature may be not considered currently.

   The Mesh networks might support more reliable and stable features in
   order to forward the packets like wired networks.  Therefore,
   multiple path routings using homogeneous or heterogeneous multiple
   interfaces may be a candidate.  In these cases, path and
   interface(channel) independency is most import issue.

3.3.  High Quality of Services for Mobile Hosts under the control of
      MANET Routers

   The MANET means Mobile, Multihop, Wireless networks.  Each MANET
   Router (MNR) has one or more MANET interfaces.  The MANET interfaces
   recognize and process each routing protocol to ensure MANET
   communications.  And The MANET interfaces also include zero or more
   non-MANET interfaces which forward the packets towards (mobile)
   hosts.  These non-MANET aware interfaces do not have to be aware of
   MANETs' characteristics.  But, we consider the mobile host's mobility
   features (e.g., moving speed, join/leave rate, etc.) and required the
   QoS of mobile host applications in order to decide to keep the number
   of multiple path between MANET routers.

3.4.  Internet Connectivity through the Multiple Gateways

   The MANETs might consider Internet connectivities and moving MNR with
   multiple (mobile) hosts.  The multiple gateways may be used to
   support high quality of services.  In cases, multiple path routing is
   more useful between MNR(s) and gateway(s) or between MNR(s) and
   MNR(s).

   Herein, the gateway function may be implemented in MANET router,
   which do not support the mobility features.  And the moving MNR is
   out of scope in this document.


4.  Design Issues for Multiple Path Routings

4.1.  Supporting multiple interfaces

   The MNRs might have their own naming and addressing because it may be
   isolated from public networks and may be temporary.  That is, the
   MNRs might have IP prefixes and addresses, only used in their domain.
   They may also support each address autoconfiguration through one or
   more MANET interfaces.  These address autoconfigurations may be used
   in either flat or hierarchical MNRs to support the packet
   communications among MNRs through the multiple paths.

4.2.  Defining multiple path selection criteria

   Generally, the multiple path routings are used to improve the end-to-
   end throughput.  In these cases, multiple paths might be selected in
   order to maximize the utilization of interfaces and their channels in
   MANET routers.

   There are two major issues.  One is determining path/link metrics to
   guarantee the path independency fully for deterministic time period.
   The other is method to distinguish new one from already selected
   paths.  That is, it is required to define the identifier of each path
   to select the new path easily during the path discovery of routing
   protocols.

4.3.  Relation between link/path metrics and multiple paths

   In general, MANET routings do not influence deeply in the method of
   link/path metric.  If we consider the multiple paths as the proper
   way, the selection of link/path metric is more important because the
   throughput of simultaneous use of multiple paths is determined from
   link/path-disjoint.  Therefore, link-, interface- and node-disjoint
   are most import features of multiple path selection.

Internet-Draft       Multi-path Analysis & Scenarios           July 2009


   For example, the interfaces of MANET routers have an asymmetric link
   feature.  It means that their routers can not get the role of
   transmitter or receiver at the same time.  Therefore, routing
   protocols, based on symmetric link, might be changed.  Even though
   the DSR routing may support the asymmetirc feature in a single
   interface, new routing protocols might consider the multiple,
   heterogeneous and symmetric/asymmetric interfaces.  The pair of
   incoming and outgoing interfaces may be required to support the bi-
   directional services.

4.4.  Multiple Internet Connectivity

   The MNRs may support the multiple Internet connectivities through the
   border gateway(s).  To get the multiple connectivity to the Internet,
   the global IP addresses and public DNS services might be taken.

   The MANETs and their routers may support the high/moderate mobility.
   But the border gateways may not consider their mobility.  If we only
   consider the mobile hosts under the control of their MNRs, the NEMO
   and MANEMO works may be good choices.

4.5.  Policy of using multiple paths

   Even thought the source node should be scheduled to forward packets
   by dispersing traffic loads through multiple paths, the data
   transmission is only under the control of Application users in MANET.


5.  Types of Multiple Path Routing Protocols

   There are many types for distinction of multiple path routings.  For
   example, the number of interfaces, disjoint and the method of
   multipath generation are considered in this document.

5.1.  The number of interfaces

   The multiple path routings could be implemented over the single or
   multiple interfaces of MNR node.  Herein, multiple interfaces are
   homogeneous or heterogeneous radio technology.

   In case of the multiple path routings over the single interface, the
   key issue of generating multiple paths is selection of multiple
   channels.  According to use of multiple channels on MNRs, node-
   disjoint based multiple paths might be selected.

   In case of multiple path routings over the multiple interfaces, the
   key issue of generating multiple paths is considering the distinction
   of multiple links, interfaces and nodes.

Internet-Draft       Multi-path Analysis & Scenarios           July 2009


5.2.  Routing metrics

   The link/path metrics may be considered to support the independency
   of multiple paths, which were made during routing discovery.  In
   here, multiple path routings are distinguished by using routing
   metrics as follows:

   o  Multiple path routing supporting link-disjoint metric

   o  Multiple path routing supporting interface-disjoint metric

   o  Multiple path routing supporting node-disjoint metric

   o  Multiple path routing supporting the combination of metrics

5.3.  Generation methods of multiple paths

   In IETF MANET WG, the standard ad hoc routing protocols have been
   developing such as DYMO and OLSRv2.  According the reactive routing
   like DYMO, this document suggests the generation methods of multiple
   paths as follows:

   o  Extension of reactive routing protocol

   o  Independent reuse of reactive routing protocol

   The first mechanism means that route request and reply message pair
   should be used just once.  Therefore, routing protocol should be
   extended to make the multiple paths.  The method should also select
   the proper routing metrics to maximize the link/node's disjoint.

   The second means that the same or different routing protocols are
   used repeatedly through the single or multiple interfaces.  In this
   case, path identifier should be required to distinguish the multiple
   paths.  Routing protocol identifier (ex.  Dymo IDentifer) should be
   also required to check and process the different routing protocols.


6.  Example scenarios of Multiple Path Routing Protocols

6.1.  Extension of ad hoc routing protocol

   TBD

6.2.  Independent reuse of ad hoc routing protocol

   TBD

7.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

   This is an informational document.  IANA requirements for MANET
   related protocols will be developed within the protocol
   specifications for MANET protocols.


8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations can not be applied to this document since
   this document does not specify a new protocol.
