Abstract


   This document defines Uniform Resource Identifiers for Physical  
   Objects and human.It provides a proposal for the implementation of the 
   Concept, ˆPhysical resources as well as humans should be accessible
   over the Internet and an information object is on the web if it can have 
   a URI ˆ. It emphasizes on the fact that people should be able to
   access the physical resources,they possess or even humans,from anywhere 
   in the world through a common standard(URI) e.g. accessing a car from a 
   remote location,or finding the location of the child via URI.As URIs are
   needed in RDF,XML,so by using them for ubiquitous resources we could 
   easily integrate the world of ubiquitous computing and semantic web i.e.
   Ubiquitous Semantic Web.

Internet-Draft          WEB OF PHYSICAL OBJECTS URI           March  2 ,2004



1.WHY URI?
       Before moving on ,the question why should physical resources
be allocated URIs for accessing them on the Internet  has the
following answer. 
      " An information object is "on the web" if it has a URI. 
Objects which have URIs are sometimes known as 'First Class Objects' 
(FCOs).  The Web works best when any information object of value and 
identity is a first class object.If something does not have a URI, 
you can't refer to it, and the power of the Web is the less for thatˆ[6]



2. THE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM


       Conceptually the Internet is partitioned into different top-level 
domains and each domain encompasses many hosts. This has been shown in fig 1.
Here each top node represents a top-level domain, which covers many hosts. 
Each host is a leaf and represents a single host or it contains hundreds 
of host within it.e,g mail.yahoo.com, groups.yahoo.com and so on [1].

      Now if this domain name system is extended to one more domain
,which could provide the network addresses of the physical resources
 in the world then the axioms


 ÙAxiom 0: Universality 1


     Any resource anywhere can be given a URI


 Axiom 0a: Universality 2


    Any resource of significance should be given a URIˆ[6]  


      could be implemented as well. Physical resources could be 
accessed through the already existing Internet and World Wide Web 
could be utilized to its full potential.
                
                
                 The extended hierarchy has been shown in figure 2

     Here WPO stands for Ù A Web Of Physical Objectsˆ, pk represents
 country Pakistan, krh represents city Karachi, ID represents the 
social security number or national identity card number of a person 
and Car-01 is identifier of the car for that person. So that it can 
be accessed over the web and its properties can be manipulated, but 
for this to be happened some protocol is needed.


3. URI SCHEME            
    The main question here is the URI scheme or the accessible protocol
 for this domain?
    As HTTP is already a well established URI scheme. Here it would be 
best to utilize the already existing scheme rather than developing a 
separate scheme and designed everything for it from the scratch.
    
   Ù A feature of HTTP is the typing and negotiation of data representation,
 allowing systems to be built independently of the data being transferred.
 HTTP is also used as a generic protocol for communication between user

agents and proxies/gateways to other Internet systems, including those supported by 
the SMTP, NNTP, FTP, and Gopher.
       In this way, HTTP allows basic hypermedia access to resources 
available from diverse applications.ˆ[2]


4. ELABORATING THE PERSPECTIVE


       To elaborate on the perspective of new domain and URI for the 
web of physical objects, assume the following scenarios.                     


       Consider a person possessing a home with different kinds of
 appliances,along with a car. This person leaves his home for few 
days to some other city or a hill sport.  On the way he remembers that
 he forgot to turn his fridge off,to lock his cupboard, he wants to
 check if there are any intruders in his home or if he is coming back 
he wants to turn his bed room Air Condition on from a short distance.
      Or consider an organization having an office building/buildings 
and a CEO of the organization wants to check for the security of the 
organization files or CDs by checking the locks of the cupboard of his
 room from the remote place or a head peon of organization wants to check 
for the status of the windows and doors of the office, either open or close, 
from his home. Or consider an old man or young kid leaves his home 
without notifying the Guardian of the home. When the Guardian notices the
absence of the child or old man, he wants to find him.  (Although, a lot
 of research is being carried out on this chapters, which is mostly related 
to the architecture and framework. But the main concern here is the 
identification of devices and a uniform higher level communication so 
that already existing web and these architectures could be utilized to
 their full potential.)
       Thus there are three possible scenarios for communication , the
 mechanism by which these communications can proceed has been explained below.        
 
5. MECHANISMS


      The Possible mechanisms are   


 5.1. PERSON-TO-APPLIANCES


         In Person to appliances communication the person would want to 
communicate with the appliances, he has. For this there is a top level domain 
called WPO, A Web of Physical Objects, for the accessibility of physical 
objects through the web.  But there are some requirements for it.

Internet-Draft        WEB OF PHYSICAL OBJECTS URI           March  2 ,2004



*A person should have a unique identifier such as social security
   number or National Identification Card Number.


* An appliance should have a unique id as well with reference to or 
  within the scope of unique identification of person.



With this unique number such as ID-523-82-070376 and a unique id for 
appliance such as TV01, CAR01, AC01, he/she could access his home 
appliances from anywhere.


               Then the hierarchy will be

          What does this mean? This means that there is a user with 
NationalID card number 52381070376, country  (Pakistan), city Karachi 
and that user can access his/her tv001 from a remote place with this
 URI.But this access should be secure, so that only this person can 
manipulate its properties.



5.2. SECURE ACCESS
                 
       For a secure access such as only the user would be able to
 access his/her TV not every one else, the user id and password should 
be used for the accessing e.g


       http:// tv001.52382070376.krh.pk.wpo?uid=shary&pwd=xc4532fg
                   
      This means that there is a user Ùsharyˆ with some encrypted 
password and wants to access the tv001 of the person with ID52382070376.
 This will not only allow secure access but it will also allow the 
management of multiple users on the same device or in other words the 
concept of shared devices can easily be manipulated. 
      Like a software application, there could be many users of same 
application but the difference lies in their shared level access. 
Usually, there is an application or system administrator who possesses 
the majority of the rights and allows or creates other users to access 
the system.Similarly, in terms of physical resource there should be 
multiple users of the same resource or physical object and there must 
be an Object Administrator who will work similarly as an Application 
Administrator and will be able to access the resource through


    http://tv001.009252382070376.krh.pk.wpo?uid=administrator&pwd=ucA657ghj


      It depends on this administrator allow other users full access or 
just a limited access. 
   
5.3. WHERE AND HOW:
      Where this administrator can create these users, where would 
this secure authentication be processed and where should this query
travel on the net?
      Object Administrator should be able to create users or allow
 different kind of privileges to users either from the home 
server or directly from the interface of the device. The creation of names
 such as tv001 or car02 also depends on this user, he/she should create and 
map them to the device form his home server. It also fulfills the 
following axiom

Internet-Draft        WEB OF PHYSICAL OBJECTS URI           March  2 ,2004


ÙAXIOM 2b


the significance of identity for a given URI is determined by the 
person who owns the URI, who first determined what it points to.ˆ [6]


     As there is a name server in case of other domains similarly
 a name server here should function in the same way. All the queries 
relating to the physical objects will be directed towards the nearest 
wpo name servers which then process and in case of no matching query 
direct it to the other wpo server and so on ,finally to  the home server 
of  the identifier(e.g. 52382070376).The home server is the main server 
where all the authentications will be carried out. It is not necessary 
that it should be a desktop server it could be any microchip .As the 
technology is progressing it is no longer a science fiction any more. 
With this home server user would be able to create the users of their 
appliances with different kinds of privileges.



5.4. COMMUNICATION LANGUAGE
  
   So far nothing has been discussed on the topic of communication 
language between these devices and how the user would be able to 
control his home from far away places. How would the user access
 the attributes, properties and methods of the physical objects? 
     The language of communication should be XML and it should be 
used to access the properties and methods of Physical objects. 
Because it is already progressing and becoming a standard for B2B 
(Business to Business), B2P (Business To Person) and A2A (Application
 to Application) .RDF (Resource Description Framework) is also based 
on the XML and with the XML as communication language it can be used 
as well . Infect the use of RDF will help web agents in understandings
 the semantics and devices will be able to communicate with each other
 via web agents. Lots of theory discussed till now, lets move on to 
some examples.

5.5 EXAMPLES


   In the following example user with ID 52382070376 is accessing 
his/her TV number 1. 
              
   http://tv001.52382070376.krh.pk.wpo?uid=administrator&pwd=ucA657ghj


  After the authentication the device such as tv01 should return an 
XML file 
  
  <? xml version="1.0" ?>
   <RDF xmlns = "http://w3.org/TR/1999/PR-rdf-syntax-19990105#"

    <TVs:STATUS> off </ TVs:STATUS>
    <TVs:TUNETOCHANNEL> NULL</ TVs:TUNETOCHANNEL>
  </Description>
</RDF>


                                
    Here this XML file is an RDF document, which explains that tv001 
of person with national identity card number 52382070376 has model 
Philips-AE-400, channels 400 and at the moment it is in off mode and 
there is no channel on display.
     The browser at the client side should read this XML and visualize 
it for the client .Using this the user at the client side will be able to 
send the reply back to the home server such as this.


  <? xml version="1.0" ?>
   <RDF xmlns = "http://w3.org/TR/1999/PR-rdf-syntax-19990105#"
     xmlns:TVs = "http:// tvmanufacturers.com/tv#" >
  <Description about = " http://tv001.52382070376.krh.pk.wpo" >

    < TVs:STATUS> on </ TVs:STATUS>
    < TVs:TUNETOCHANNEL> CNN </ TVs:TUNETOCHANNEL>
  </Description>
</RDF>
      This means that user wants to turn his TV on and tune to channel CNN.


      But this is not the end of the story, the user could create his own 
schema, develop his own personal ontology as the semantic web community 
focuses on.

and this file could be accessed  by the web agent of microwave oven of
the neighbor by accessing the URI 


  http://mcw001.52382070376.krh.pk.wop?uid=neighbor&pwd=sdf345gf/
        cookingrecipe/almondbiryani


       Either the neighbor itself can access it or web agent will 
automatically be able to check for it once asked to do so.
       With these URIs Web agents will be able to roam from one device 
to another as they only will need a URI to move on. Even authenticate 
on the behalf of a person, will be able to check for different updates 
such as this recipe at the neighbors microwave with the shared level 
access, and will prompt the neighbor if he wants to cook it. A device 
can automatically check for the latest updates on the manufacturers site 
and prompt the user for the updates via web agent. 


5.6. MAPPING OF URIS TO IP ADDRESSES.


       As ipv6 is already in the market it would not be difficult to 
allocate IPs to persons and each person could have as many devices as he/she
can and each device can have an IP address, but the IP Addresses of these

devices should be just like the  private IP addresses in a local intranet. 



5.7. ORGANIZATIONS


    As organizations usually have shared resources or the task is divided 
among humans, so they need a shared level access. (Here organizations also 
include industries, offices and even shops etc).
    Each person of the organization will be able to access the resources 
under his control through this scheme.
             
5.8. EXAMPLES 


A CEO can access his cupboard through 
 
      http://cbd01.abccompany.wop?uid=ceo&pwd=asfr435gf


Similarly a head peon can access the doors and windows through this


           http://window01.abccompany.wop?uid=Hpeon&pwd=asfg567
           http://door09.abccompany.wop?uid=Hpeon&pwd=asfg567


 Manufactured instruments through their model number

    In this way the organizations will be able to access their
 manufactured devices,check for their working condition. But the
 organizations should not be able to turn their device on or off 
or access any other property of the device, which is related to 
the user of the device after selling that device.
     All these URIs should return the related XML files, which 
should be processed at client and respond back to that resource. 
(This procedure has already been explained above)


5.9. PERSON-TO-PERSON
  
    Today if you want a profile about a person, you can retrieve it 
through his home page or his messenger identity, if you want to contact
 him ,you can call him on his cell phone or home or office. Lots of 
communication options already available.

5.10.  EXAMPLES
     
       Alternatively, this could also be done through this 


http://52382070376.krh.pk.wop/uid=akhtar&pwd=sasdf547gfd/profile



or if it is a public profile


http://52382070376.krh.pk.wop/profile
     
An XML file that should be returned could be like this


  <? xml version="1.0" ?>
 <RDF xmlns = "http://w3.org/TR/1999/PR-rdf-syntax-19990105#"
      xmlns:prf = "http://www.XYZ.COM >

          This shows the profile for a person.
     One other very important thing is the location of that person, 
where he/she is. But it should be available to only authenticated users 
such as the guardian as explained previously.
  
  http://loc.52382070376.krh.pk.wop/uid=Guardian&pwd=gfdh567hg
 Which should return an XML file mentioning the location of  the device
(here the name of device is loc) and the file returned could be.
 
<? xml version="1.0" ?>

6. GENERIC URI
       So the generic URI is (Since the term URI has been used throughout this 
document, but according to [3], it is a URL "Uniform Resource Locator" (URL)
 which refers to the subset of URI that identify resources via a 
representation of their primary access mechanism (e.g., their network 
"location"), rather than identifying the resource by name or by some other 
attribute(s) of that resource.)
        
                The hierarchy has been shown in figure 4

     Physical Resource= Unique device ID with in the scope of identification.



     While the URI Scheme is Hyper Text Transfer Protocol HTTP.
   



7.0 CONCLUSION
              
        Because URIs are needed everywhere RDF, ontologies,web services
or XML and  web agents can roam from device to device with the help of URI.
        But after the implementation of this scheme there will be some 
new challeges or new problems will rise such as robbers will not rob but 
hack the houses and home appliance will malfunction because of viruses.          
        But the use of URIs for device identification would not only allow 
the easy manipulation of that device from far away places but it will also 
help in easy device discovery for web agents, use of personal schemas, 
defining of the ontology by individuals which will be reused by others,
accessing of humans through the web, which in the end will result in the 
development of Ubiquitously Semantic Web.Finally      


           ÙIf something does not have a URI, you can't refer to it, and 
the power of the Web is the less for thatˆ[4]
