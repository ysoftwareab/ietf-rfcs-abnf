1. Introduction

    There should be a concept of mask that can be applied to HTTP URLs
    and implementable in a browser and easily creatable using a browser.

2. Background
	I am a publisher of an impressive information site but a victim
	of cybercrime. So i have to publish information thats not pleasant to
	view even for me. So i see a need to give an Option of mask as a drop down
	menu or that can be creatable by a user viewing a page.

3. General Information of the service
	THis should involve modifying HTTP protocol and more research is needed
        for finalising requirements.
	Think of the static or dynamic page you are viewing your information
	as a rectangle of dots. You can create an information mask that shows
	only certain dots and not others. You as a publisher of a static or dynamic
	page can offer your own masks or the viewer of a certain information
	site can create his or her own mask, and this could include more than inclusion
	and exclusion and some executable logic also.Since 2008 my information
      page has been cluttered with my concerns of being attacked and irritated
      while travelling and details of cybercrime. I have information that 2 or 3
      interest groups would like and i should be able to offer masks so those
      i nterest groups see only what they need.
