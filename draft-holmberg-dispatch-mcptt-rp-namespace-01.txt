1.  Introduction

   The third generation partnership project (3GPP) has defined a Mission
   Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT) over LTE service [TS.3GPP.22.179].  The
   MCPTT service supports an enhanced PTT service, suitable for mission
   critical scenarios, based upon 3GPP Evolved Packet System (EPS)
   services.  The requirements for the MCPTT service defined within 3GPP
   can also form the basis for a non-mission critical Push To Talk (PTT)
   service.

   The MCPTT service is intended to support communication between
   several users (a group call), where each user has the ability to gain
   access to the permission to talk in an arbitrated manner.  However,
   the MCPTT service also supports private calls between pairs of users.

   MCPTT is primarily targeting to provide a professional Push To Talk
   service to e.g., public safety, transport companies, utilities or
   industrial and nuclear plants.  In addition to this a commercial PTT
   service for non-professional use (e.g., groups of people on holiday)
   may be delivered through an MCPTT system.  Based on their operational
   model, the performance and MCPTT features in use vary per user
   organization, where functionality which is more mission critical
   specific (e.g., Ambient Listening and Imminent Peril Call) might not
   be available to commercial customers.

   The MCPTT service provides its users with different priorities for
   the access to network resources in order to provide means to
   prioritize between calls when resources are scarce.  These priorities
   take into account among other things the priority and role of the
   caller, the priority and type of the group, and the situation in
   which the call is made.  According to [TS.3GPP.22.179] at least 8 and
   up to 30 priority levels are required.

Internet-Draft             MCPTT R-P namespace                 June 2016


   High priority calls when there is danger of life for either the
   public safety worker or any other human need to be set up immediately
   and thus require preemption.  Other calls may be less sensitive in
   call set-up time but have a high priority once established.  For
   these calls a queueing mechanism is more appropriate.

   This document creates additional Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   Resource-Priority namespaces to meet the requirements of the 3GPP
   defined Mission Critical Push To Talk, and places these namespaces in
   the IANA registry.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Applicability

   This document defines namespaces applicable for MCPTT services
   defined by 3GPP that use the network services of a 3GPP defined LTE
   network.

4.  New SIP Resource-Priority Namespaces Created

4.1.  Introduction

   This document introduces the MCPTT namespaces mcpttp and mcptt2, the
   name coming from the 3GPP defined Mission Critical Push To Talk
   service.

4.2.  The MCPTT namespaces

   The mcpttp namespace uses the priority levels listed below from
   lowest to highest priority.

      mcpttp.0 (lowest priority)
      mcpttp.1
      mcpttp.2
      mcpttp.3
      mcpttp.4
      mcpttp.5
      mcpttp.6
      mcpttp.7
      mcpttp.8
      mcpttp.9
      mcpttp.10
      mcpttp.11

Internet-Draft             MCPTT R-P namespace                 June 2016


      mcpttp.12
      mcpttp.13
      mcpttp.14
      mcpttp.15 (highest priority)

   Intended algorithm for mcpttp is preemption.

   New Warning code: No.

   New SIP response code: No.

   The mcpttq namespace uses the priority levels listed below from
   lowest to highest priority.

      mcpttq.0 (lowest priority)
      mcpttq.1
      mcpttq.2
      mcpttq.3
      mcpttq.4
      mcpttq.5
      mcpttq.6
      mcpttq.7
      mcpttq.8
      mcpttq.9
      mcpttq.10
      mcpttq.11
      mcpttq.12
      mcpttq.13
      mcpttq.14
      mcpttq.15 (highest priority)

   Intended algorithm for mcpttq is queuing.

   New Warning code: No.

   New SIP response code: No.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document has the same Security Considerations as [RFC4412].

6.  IANA Considerations

   Abiding by the rules established within [RFC4412] and [RFC7134], this
   is an Informative RFC registering two new namespaces, their
   associated priority-values, and intended algorithms.
