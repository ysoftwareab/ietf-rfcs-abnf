         Identity-Based Signatures for MANET Routing Protocols
                        draft-ietf-manet-ibs-01

Abstract

   This document extends [RFC7182], which specifies a framework for, and
   specific examples of, integrity check values (ICVs) for packets and
   messages using the generalized packet/message format specified in
   [RFC5444].  It does so by defining an additional cryptographic
   function that allows the creation of an ICV that is an identity-based
   signature, defined according to the ECCSI (Elliptic Curve-Based
   Certificateless Signatures for Identity-Based Encryption) algorithm
   specified in [RFC6507].

Internet-Draft          Identity-Based Signatures              July 2014


1.  Introduction

   [RFC7182] defines ICV (integrity check value) TLVs for use in packets
   and messages that use the generalized MANET packet/message format
   defined in [RFC5444].  This specification extends the TLV definitions
   therein by defining two new cryptographic function code points that
   allow the use of an identity-based signature (IBS) as an ICV.  An IBS
   has an additional property that is not shared by any of the
   previously specified ICVs, it not only indicates that the protected
   packet or message is valid, but also verifies the originator of the
   packet/message.

   This specification assumes that each router (protocol participant)
   has an identity that may be tied to the packet or message.  The
   router may have more than one identity, but will only use one for
   each ICV TLV.  The cryptographic strength of the IBS is not dependent
   on the choice of identity.

   Two options for the choice of identity are supported (the two code
   points allocated).  In the first the identity can be any octet
   sequence (up to 255 octets) included in the ICV TLV.  In the second,
   the octet sequence is preceded by an address, either the IP source
   address for a packet TLV, or the message originator address for a
   message or address block TLV.  In particular, the second option
   allows just the address to be used as an identity.

   Identity-based signatures, compared to the shared secret key ICVs
   specified in [RFC7182], allow identifying the originator of
   information in a packet or message.  They thus allow additional
   security functions, such as revocation of an identity, and removing
   all information with a specific originator, if this is recorded - as
   it is for OLSRv2 [RFC7181], an expected user of this specification.
   When applied to messages (rather than packets) this can significantly
   reduce the damage that a compromised router can inflict on the
   network.

   Identity-based signatures are based on forms of asymmetric (public
   key) cryptography - identity-based encryption (IBE).  In terms of
   their use, IBE and IBS methods have a major advantage, and a major
   disadvantage, compared to more widely used public key cryptography
   solutions, such as RSA.

   The advantage referred to is that each router can be configured once
   (for its key lifetime) by a trusted authority, independently of all
   other routers.  Thus router A can connect to the authority (typically
   in a secure environment) to receive a private key, or can have a
   private key delivered securely (out of band) from the authority.
   During normal operation of the MANET, there is no need for the

Internet-Draft          Identity-Based Signatures              July 2014


   trusted authority to be connected to the MANET, or even to still
   exist.  Additional routers can be authorized, with no reference to
   previously authorized routers (the trusted authority must still exist
   in this case).  A router's public key is its identity, which when
   tied to a packet or message (as is the case when using an address as,
   or as part of, the identity) means that there is no need for public
   key certificates or a certificate authority.

   The disadvantage referred to is that the trusted authority has
   complete authority, even more so than a conventional certificate
   authority.  Routers cannot generate their own private keys, only the
   trusted authority can do that.  Through the master secret held by the
   trusted authority, it could impersonate any router (existing or not).
   When used for identity-based encryption (not part of this
   specification) the trusted authority can decrypt anything.  However,
   note that the shared secret key options described in [RFC7182] also
   have this limitation.

   There are alternative mathematical realizations of identity-based
   signatures.  This specification uses one that has been previously
   published as [RFC6507], known as ECCSI (Elliptic Curve-Based
   Certificateless Signatures for Identity-Based Encryption).  In common
   with other identity-based encryption/signature approaches, it is
   based on the use of elliptic curves.  Unlike some, it does not use
   "pairings" (bilinear maps from a product of two elliptic curve groups
   to another group).  It thus may be easier to implement, and more
   efficient, than some alternatives, although with a greater signature
   size than some.  This specification allows the use of any elliptic
   curve that may be used by [RFC6507].

   The computational load imposed by ECCSI (and, perhaps more so, other
   IBS methods) is not trivial, though depending significantly on the
   quality of implementation of the required elliptic curve and other
   mathematical functions.  For a security level of 128 bits, the ICV
   data length is 129 octets, which is longer than for alternative ICVs
   specified in [RFC7182] (e.g., 32 octets for the similar strength
   HMAC-SHA-256).  The signature format used could have been slightly
   shortened (to 97 octets) by using a compressed representation of an
   elliptic curve point, however at the expense of some additional work
   when verifying a signature, and loss of direct compatibility with
   [RFC6507], and implementations thereof.

   The trusted authority is referred to in [RFC6507] as the KMS (Key
   Management Service).  That term will be used in the rest of this
   specification.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   Additionally, this document uses the terminology of [RFC5444],
   [RFC6507], and [RFC7182].


3.  Applicability Statement

   This specification adds an additional option to the framework
   specified in [RFC7182] for use by [RFC5444] formatted packets and
   messages.  It is applicable as described in [RFC7182], and subject to
   the additional comments in Section 6.

   Specific examples of protocols for which this specification is
   suitable are NHDP [RFC6130] and OLSRv2 [RFC7181].


4.  Specification

4.1.  Cryptographic Function

   This specification defines a cryptographic function named ECCSI that
   is implemented as specified as the "sign" function in Section 5.2.1
   of [RFC6507].  To use that specification:

   o  The ICV is not calculated as cryptographic-function(hash-
      function(content)) as defined in [RFC7182], but (like the HMAC
      ICVs defined there) uses the hash function within the
      cryptographic function.  The option "none" is not permitted for
      hash-function, and the hash function must have a known fixed
      length of N octets, as specified in Section 4.2.

   o  M in [RFC6507] is "content" as specified in in [RFC7182].

   o  ID, used in [RFC6507], is as specified in Section 4.3.

   o  KPAK, SSK and PVT, used in [RFC6507], are as specified in Sections
      4.2 and 5.1.1 of [RFC6507], provided by the KMS.

   The length of the signature is 4N+1 octets, as specified in
   [RFC6507], whose affine coordinate format (including an octet valued
   0x04 to identify this) is used unchanged.

Internet-Draft          Identity-Based Signatures              July 2014


   Verification of the ICV is not implemented by the receiver
   recalculating the ICV and comparing with the received ICV, as it is
   necessarily incapable of doing so.  Instead the receiver evaluates
   the "verify" function described in Section 5.2.2 of [RFC6507], which
   may pass or fail.

   To use that function M, KPAK, SSK and PVT are as specified above,
   while ID is deduced from the received packet or message, as specified
   in Section 4.3, using the <key-id> element in the <ICV-value>.  This
   element need not match that used by the receiver, and thus when using
   this cryptographic function, multiple ICV TLVs differing only in
   their <key-id>, or in the choice of cryptographic function from the
   two defined in this specification, SHOULD NOT be used unless routers
   are administratively configured to recognize which to verify.

   Routers MAY be administratively configured to reject a packet or
   message ICV TLV using ECCSI based on part or all of <key-id>; for
   example if this encodes a time after which this identity is no longer
   valid.

4.2.  ECCSI parameters

   Section 4.1 of [RFC6507] specifies parameters n, N, p, E, B, G, and
   q.  The first of these, n, is specified as "A security parameter; the
   size in bits of the prime p over which elliptic curve cryptography is
   to be performed."  For typical security levels (e.g., 128, 192 and
   256 bits), n must be at least twice the required bits of security,
   see Section 5.6.1 of [NIST-SP-800-57].

   Selection of an elliptic curve, and all related parameters, MUST be
   by administrative means, and known to all routers.  This
   specification follows [RFC6507] with a RECOMMENDED selection to
   follow Appendix D.1.2 of [NIST-FIPS-186-4].  (Note that n in that
   document is q in [RFC6507].)

   The parameter that is required by this specification is N, which is
   defined as Ceiling(n/8).  The hash function used must create an
   output of size N octets.  In particular for 128 bit security, and
   hence n = 256, N = 32, and the RECOMMENDED hash function is SHA-256.
   The signature (i.e. <ICV-data>) length is 4N + 1 octets, i.e., 129
   octets for N = 32.

   Note: [RFC6507] actually refers to the predecessor to
   [NIST-FIPS-186-4], but the latest version is specified here; there
   are no significant differences in this regard.

4.3.  Identity

   There are two options for the identity ID used by [RFC6507], which
   are indicated by there being two code points allocated for this
   cryptographic function, see Section 5.

   o  For the cryptographic function ECCSI ID is the element <key-id>
      defined in Section 12.1 of [RFC7182].  This MUST NOT be empty.

   o  For the cryptographic function ECCSI-ADDR, ID is the concatenation
      of an address (in network byte order) and the element <key-id>
      defined in Section 12.1 of [RFC7182], where the latter MAY be
      empty.  For a packet TLV this address is the IP source address of
      the IP datagram in which this packet is included.  For a message
      TLV or an address block TLV this address is the message originator
      address (the element <msg-orig-addr> defined in [RFC5444]) if that
      address is present, if not present and the message is known to
      have travelled only one hop, then the IP source address of the IP
      datagram in which this message is included is used, otherwise no
      address is defined and the message MUST be rejected.  (Note that
      HELLO messages specified in NHDP [RFC6130] and used in OLSRv2
      [RFC7181] always only travel one hop, and hence their IP source
      address SHOULD be used if no originator address is present.)

   Note that this identity is formatted by [RFC6507], and thus does not
   need a length field incorporated into it by this specification.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has, in accordance with [RFC7182], defined a registry for the
   cryptographic functions.  IANA is requested to modify this allocation
   as indicated.

6.  Security Considerations

   This specification extends the security framework for MANET routing
   protocols specified in [RFC7182] by the addition of an additional
   cryptographic function, in two forms according to how identity is
   specified.

   This cryptographic function implements a form of identity-based
   signature (IBS), a stronger form of integrity check value (ICV) that
   verifies not just that the received packet or message is valid but
   that the packet or message originated at a router that was assigned a
   private key for the specified identity.

   For a message the identity is, and for a packet it is recommended
   that it is, either the originator address of the router (i.e., an
   address unique to that router), or the originator address with
   additional information appended.  The use of that additional
   information is outside the scope of this specification, a typical use
   may be to indicate an expiry time for signatures created using that
   identity.

   In common with other forms of IBS, a feature of the form of IBS
   (known as ECCSI) used in this specification is that it requires a
   trusted authority (KMS) that issues all private keys, and has
   complete cryptographic information about all possible private keys.
   However to set against that, the solution is scalable, as all routers
   can be independently keyed, and does not need the KMS in the network.
   If no future keys will be required, then the KMS's master secret can
   be destroyed.  As routers are individually keyed, key revocation (by
   blacklist and time expiry of keys) is possible, but is beyond the
   scope of this specification.

   ECCSI is based on elliptic curve mathematics.  This specification
   follows [RFC6507] in its recommendation of elliptic curves, but any
   suitable (prime power) elliptic curve may be used; this must be
   administratively specified.  Implementation of this specification
   will require an available implementation of suitable mathematical
   functions.  Unlike some other forms of IBS, ECCSI requires only basic
   elliptic curve operations, it does not require "pairings" (bilinear
   functions of a product of two elliptic curve groups).  This increases
   the available range of suitable mathematical libraries.

   In order to provide an example of an ECCSI ICV Message TLV that may
   be added to this message, the fields shown need to all have numerical
   values, both by inserting defined numerical values (e.g. 0 for HELLO)
   and by selecting example values where needed.  The latter consists
   of:

   o  The message sequence number will be zero.

   o  The five addresses will be 192.0.2.1 to 192.0.2.5.

   o  The message validity time will be 6 seconds, and the message
      interval time will be 2 seconds, each encoded with a constant
      value C = 1/1024 seconds, as described in [RFC5497], as referenced

      from [RFC6130].

   In addition, when calculating an ICV, the hop count and hop limit are
   both set to zero.  This results in the message:

   The ICV TLV that will be added will have cryptographic function
   ECCSI-ADDR, and hash function SHA-256.  This message has no
   originator address, but it travels a single hop, and its IP source
   address can be used.  This will be assumed to be 192.0.2.0, with an
   empty <key-id>, thus the sender's identity will be, in hexadecimal
   form:
