1.  Introduction

   Guaranteeing both physical layer robustness and efficient usage of
   the radio resource has been in the core design of SATellite
   COMmunication (SATCOM) systems.  The trade-off often resided in how
   much redundancy a system had to add to cope from link impairments,
   without reducing the good-put when the channel quality is high.
   Generally speaking, enough redundancy is added so as to guarantee a
   Quasi-Error Free transmission; however, there are cases where the
   physical layer could hardly recover the transmission losses (e.g.
   with a mobile user) and layer 2 (or above) re-transmissions induce an
   at least 500 ms delay with a geostationary satellite.  Further
   exploiting network coding schemes at higher OSI-layers is an
   opportunity for releasing constraints on the physical layer and
   improve the performance of SATCOM systems when the physical layer is
   challenged.  We have noticed an active research activity on how
   network coding and SATCOM in the past.  That being said, not much has
   actually made it to industrial developments.  In this context, this
   memo aims at:

   o  summing up the current deployment of network coding schemes over
      LEO and GEO satellite systems;

   o  identifying opportunities for further usage of network coding in
      these systems.

1.1.  Glossary

   The glossary of this memo is related to the network coding taxonomy
   document [I-D.irtf-nwcrg-network-coding-taxonomy].

   The glossary is extended as follows:

   o  BBFRAME: Base-Band FRAME - satellite communication layer 2
      encapsulation work as follows: (1) each layer 3 packet is
      encapsulated with a Generic Stream Encapsulation (GSE) mechanism,
      (2) GSE packets are gathered to create BBFRAMEs, (3) BBFRAMEs
      contain information related to how they have to be modulated (4)
      BBFRAMEs are forwarded to the physical layer;

   o  CPE: Customer Premise Equipment;

   o  DTN: Delay/Disruption Tolerant Network;

   o  EPC: Evolved Packet Core;

   o  ETSI: European Telecommunications Standards Institute;

   o  PEP: Performance Enhanced Proxy - a typical PEP for satellite
      communications include compression, caching and TCP acceleration;

   o  PLFRAME: Physical Layer FRAME - modulated version of a BBFRAME
      with additional information (e.g. related to synchronization);

   o  SATCOM: generic term related to all kind of SATellite
      COMmunications systems;

   o  UMTRAN: Universal Mobile Terrestrial Radio Access Network;

   o  QoS: Quality-of-Service;

   o  QoE: Quality-of-Experience;

   o  VNF: Virtualized Network Function.

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  A note on satellite topology

   The objective of this section is to provide both a generic
   description of the components composing a generic satellite system
   and their interaction.  It provides a high level description of a
   multi-gateway satellites network.  There exist multiple SATCOM
   systems, such as those dedicated to broadcasting TV or to IoT
   applications: depending on the purpose of the SATCOM system, ground
   segments are specific.  This memo lays on SATCOM systems dedicated to
   Internet access that follows the DVB-S2/RCS2 standards.

   In this context, Figure 1 shows an example of a multi-gateway
   satellite system.  More details on a generic SATCOM ground segment
   architecture for a bi-directional Internet access can be found in
   [SAT2017].  We propose a multi-gateway system since some of the use-
   cases described in this document require multiple gateways.  In a
   multi-gateway system, some elements may be centralized and/or
   gathered: the relevance of one approach compared to another depends
   on the deployment scenario.  More information on these trade-off
   discussions can be found in [SAT2017].

   It is worth noting that some functional blocks aggregate the traffic
   coming from multiple users.  Even if network coding schemes could be
   applied to any individual traffic, it could also work on a aggregate.

3.  Status of network coding in actually deployed satellite systems

   Figure 2 presents the status of the network coding deployment in
   satellite systems.  The information is based on the taxonomy document
   [I-D.irtf-nwcrg-network-coding-taxonomy] and the notations are the
   following: End-to-End Coding (E2E), Network Coding (NC), Intra-Flow
   Coding (IntraF), Inter-Flow Coding (InterF), Single-Path Coding (SP)
   and Multi-Path Coding (MP).

   X1 embodies the source coding that could be used at application level
   for instance: for video streaming on a broadband access.  X2 embodies
   the physical layer, applied to the PLFRAME, to optimize the satellite
   capacity usage.  Furthermore, at the physical layer and when random
   accesses are exploited, FEC mechanisms are exploited.

4.  Details on the use cases

   This section details use-cases where network coding schemes could
   improve the overall performance of a SATCOM system (e.g. considering
   a more efficient usage of the satellite resource, delivery delay,
   delivery ratio).

   It is worth noting that these use-cases focus more on the middleware
   (e.g. aggregation nodes) and packetization UDP/IP of Figure 2.
   Indeed, there are already lots of recovery mechanisms at the physical
   and access layers in currently deployed systems while E2E source
   coding are done at the application level.  In a multi-gateway SATCOM
   Internet access, the specific opportunities are more relevant in
   specific SATCOM components such as the "network function" block or
   the "access gateway" of Figure 1.

4.1.  Two way relay channel mode

   This use-case considers a two-way communication between end users,
   through a satellite link.  We propose an illustration of this
   scenario in Figure 3.

   Satellite terminal A (resp.  B) transmits a flow A (resp.  B) to a
   server hosting NC capabilities, which forward a combination of the
   two flows to both terminals.  This results in non-negligible
   bandwidth saving and has been demonstrated at ASMS 2010 in Cagliari
   [ASMS2010].  Moreover, with On-Board Processing satellite payloads,
   the network coding operations could be done at the satellite level,
   thus reducing the end-to-end delay of the communication.

4.2.  Reliable multicast

   This use-case considers adding redundancy to a multicast flow
   depending on what has been received by different end-users, resulting
   in non-negligible scarce resource saving.  We propose an illustration
   for this scenario in Figure 4.

   A multicast flow (M) is forward to both satellite terminals A and B.
   On the uplink, terminal A (resp.  B) does not acknowledge the packet
   Ni by sending a Li signal (resp.  Nj, Lj) and either the access
   gateway or the multicast server includes the missing packets in the
   multicast flow so that the information transfer is reliable.  This
   could be achieved by using NACK-Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM)
   [RFC5740].  However, NORM does not consider other network coding
   schemes such as sliding window encoding described in
   [I-D.irtf-nwcrg-network-coding-taxonomy].

4.3.  Hybrid access

   This use-case considers the use of multiple path management with
   network coding at the transport level to increase the reliability
   and/or the total bandwidth (using multiple path does not guarantee an
   improvement of both the reliability and the total bandwidth).  We
   propose an illustration for this scenario in Figure 5.  This use-case
   is inspired from the Broadband Access via Integrated Terrestrial
   Satellite Systems (BATS) project and has been published as an ETSI
   Technical Report [ETSITR2017].  It is worth nothing that this kind of
   architecture is also discussed in the MPTCP working group
   [I-D.boucadair-mptcp-dhc].

   To cope from packet loss (due to either end-user movements or
   physical layer impairments), network coding could be introduced in
   both the CPE and at the concentrator.

4.4.  Dealing with varying capacity

   This use-case considers the usage of network coding to overcome cases
   where the wireless link characteristics quickly change overtime and
   where the physical layer codes could not be made robust in time.
   This is particularly relevant when end users are moving and the
   channel shows important variations [IEEEVT2001].

   The architecture is recalled in Figure 6.  The network coding schemes
   could be applied at the access gateway or the network function block
   levels to increase the reliability of the transmission.  This use-
   case is mostly relevant for when mobile users are considered or when
   the chosen band induce a required physical layer coding that may
   change over time (Q/V bands, Ka band, etc.).  Depending on the use-
   case (e.g. very high frequency bands, mobile users) or depending on
   the deployment use-cases (e.g. performance of the network between
   each individual block), the relevance of adding network coding is
   different.  Then, depending on the OSI level at which network coding
   is applied, the impact on the satellite terminal is different:
   network coding may be applied on IP packets or on layer-2 proprietary
   format packets.

   during gateway handovers.  Whether this is for off-loading one given
   equipment or because the transmission quality is not the same on each
   gateway, changing the transmission gateway may be relevant.  However,
   if gateways are not properly synchronized, this may result in packet
   loss.  During these critical phases, network coding can be added to
   improve the reliability of the transmission and propose a seamless
   gateway handover.  In this case, the network coding could be applied
   at either the access gateway or the network function block.  The
   entity responsible for taking the decision to change the
   communication gateway and changing the routes is the control plane
   manager; this entity exploits a management interface.

   An example architecture for this use-case is showed in Figure 7.  It
   is worth noting that depending on the ground architecture
   [I-D.chin-nfvrg-cloud-5g-core-structure-yang] [SAT2017], some
   equipment might be communalised.

4.6.  Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networks

   Establishing communications from terrestrial gateways to aerospace
   components is a challenge due to the distances involved.  As a matter
   of fact, reliable end-to-end (E2E) communications over such links
   must cope with long delay and frequent link disruptions.  Delay/

   Disruption Tolerant Networking [RFC4838] is a solution to enable
   reliable internetworking space communications where both standard ad-
   hoc routing and E2E Internet protocols cannot be used.  DTN can also
   be seen as an alternative solution to cope with satellite
   communications usually managed by PEP.  Therefore, the transport of
   data over such networks requires the use of replication, erasure
   codes and multipath protocol schemes [WANG05] [ZHANG06] to improve
   the bundle delivery ratio and/or delivery delay.  For instance,
   transport protocols such as LTP [RFC5326] for long delay links with
   connectivity disruptions, use Automatic Repeat-reQuest (ARQ) and
   unequal error protection to reduce the amount of non-mandatory re-
   transmissions.  The work in [TOURNOUX10] proposed upon LTP a robust
   streaming method based on an on-the-fly coding scheme, where encoding
   and decoding procedures are done at the source and destination nodes,
   respectively.  However, each link path loss rate may have various
   order of magnitude and re-encoding at an intermediate node to adapt
   the redundancy can be mandatory to prevent transmission wasting.
   This idea has been put forward in
   [I-D.zinky-dtnrg-random-binary-fec-scheme] and
   [I-D.zinky-dtnrg-erasure-coding-extension], where the authors
   proposed an encoding process at intermediate DTN nodes to explore the
   possibilities of Forward Error Correction (FEC) schemes inside the
   bundle protocol [RFC5050].  Another proposal is the use of erasure
   coding inside the CCSDS (Consultative Committee for Space Data
   Systems) architecture [COLA11].  The objective is to extend the CCSDS
   File Delivery Protocol (CFDP) [CCSDS-FDP] with erasure coding
   capabilities where a Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) [RFC6816] code
   with a large block size is chosen.  Recently, on-the-fly erasure
   coding schemes [LACAN08] [SUNDARARAJAN08] [TOURNOUX11] have shown
   their benefits in terms of recovery capability and configuration
   complexity compared to traditional FEC schemes.  Using a feedback
   path when available, on-the-fly schemes can be used to enable E2E
   reliable communication over DTN with adaptive re-encoding as proposed
   in [THAI15].

5.  Discussion on the deployability

   This section discusses the deployability of the use-cases detailed in
   Section 4.

   SATCOM systems typically feature Performance Enhancement Proxy
   RFC 3135 [RFC3135] which could be relevant to host network coding
   mechanisms and thus support the use-cases that have been discussed in
   Section 4.  In particular the discussion on how network coding can be
   integrated inside a PEP with QoS scheduler has been proposed in
   RFC 5865 [RFC5865].

   Related to the foreseen virtualized network infrastructure, the
   network coding schemes could be proposed as VNF and their
   deployability enhanced.  The architecture for the next generation of
   SATCOM ground segments would rely on a virtualized environment.  This
   trend can also be seen, making the discussions on the deployability
   of network coding in SATCOM extendable to other deployment scenarios
   [I-D.chin-nfvrg-cloud-5g-core-structure-yang].  As one example, the
   network coding VNF functions deployment in a virtualized environment
   is presented in [I-D.vazquez-nfvrg-netcod-function-virtualization].

6.  Conclusion

   This document presents presents the current deployment of network
   coding in some satellite telecommunications systems along with a
   discussion on the multiple opportunities to introduce these
   techniques at a wider scale.

   Even if this document focuses on satellite systems, it is worth
   pointing out that the some scenarios proposed may be relevant to
   other wireless telecommunication systems.  As one example, the
   generic architecture proposed in Figure 1 may be mapped to cellular
   networks as follows: the 'network function' block gather some of the
   functions of the Evolved Packet Core subsystem, while the 'access
   gateway' and 'physical gateway' blocks gather the same type of
   functions as the Universal Mobile Terrestrial Radio Access Network.
   This mapping extends the opportunities identified in this draft since
   they may be also relevant for cellular networks.
