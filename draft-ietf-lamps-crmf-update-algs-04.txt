1.  Introduction

   This document updates the cryptographic algorithm requirements for
   the Password-Based Message Authentication Code (MAC) in the Internet
   X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate Request Message Format
   (CRMF) [RFC4211].  The algorithms specified in [RFC4211] were
   appropriate in 2005; however, these algorithms are no longer
   considered the best choices.  This update specifies algorithms that
   are more appropriate today.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Signature Key POP

   Section 4.1 of [RFC4211] specifies the Proof-of-Possession (POP)
   processing.  This section is updated to explicitly allow the use of
   the PBMAC1 algorithm presented in Section 7.1 of [RFC8018].

   OLD:

      algId identifies the algorithm used to compute the MAC value.  All
      implementations MUST support id-PasswordBasedMAC.  The details on
      this algorithm are presented in section 4.4

Internet-Draft     CRMF Algorithm Requirements Update      February 2021


   NEW:

      algId identifies the algorithm used to compute the MAC value.  All
      implementations MUST support id-PasswordBasedMAC as presented in
      Section 4.4 of this document.  Implementations MAY also support
      PBMAC1 presented in Section 7.1 of [RFC8018].

4.  Password-Based Message Authentication Code

   Section 4.4 of [RFC4211] specifies a Password-Based MAC that relies
   on a one-way function to compute a symmetric key from the password
   and a MAC algorithm.  This section specifies algorithm requirements
   for the one-way function and the MAC algorithm.

4.1.  Introduction Paragraph

   Add guidance about limiting the use of the password.

   OLD:

      This MAC algorithm was designed to take a shared secret (a
      password) and use it to compute a check value over a piece of
      information.  The assumption is that, without the password, the
      correct check value cannot be computed.  The algorithm computes
      the one-way function multiple times in order to slow down any
      dictionary attacks against the password value.

   NEW:

      This MAC algorithm was designed to take a shared secret (a
      password) and use it to compute a check value over a piece of
      information.  The assumption is that, without the password, the
      correct check value cannot be computed.  The algorithm computes
      the one-way function multiple times in order to slow down any
      dictionary attacks against the password value.  The password used
      to compute this MAC SHOULD NOT be used for any other purpose.

4.2.  One-Way Function

   Change the paragraph describing the "owf" as follows:

   OLD:

      owf identifies the algorithm and associated parameters used to
      compute the key used in the MAC process.  All implementations MUST
      support SHA-1.

   NEW:

Internet-Draft     CRMF Algorithm Requirements Update      February 2021


      owf identifies the algorithm and associated parameters used to
      compute the key used in the MAC process.  All implementations MUST
      support SHA-256 [SHS].

4.3.  Iteration Count

   Update the guidance on appropriate iteration count values.

   OLD:

      iterationCount identifies the number of times the hash is applied
      during the key computation process.  The iterationCount MUST be a
      minimum of 100.  Many people suggest using values as high as 1000
      iterations as the minimum value.  The trade off here is between
      protection of the password from attacks and the time spent by the
      server processing all of the different iterations in deriving
      passwords.  Hashing is generally considered a cheap operation but
      this may not be true with all hash functions in the future.

   NEW:

      iterationCount identifies the number of times the hash is applied
      during the key computation process.  The iterationCount MUST be a
      minimum of 100; however, the iterationCount SHOULD be as large as
      server performance will allow, typically at least 10,000 [DIGALM].
      There is a trade off between protection of the password from
      attacks and the time spent by the server processing the
      iterations.  As part of that tradeoff, an iteration count smaller
      than 10,000 can be used when automated generation produces shared
      secrets with high entropy.

4.4.  MAC Algorithm

   Change the paragraph describing the "mac" as follows:

   OLD:

      mac identifies the algorithm and associated parameters of the MAC
      function to be used.  All implementations MUST support HMAC-SHA1
      [HMAC].  All implementations SHOULD support DES-MAC and Triple-
      DES-MAC [PKCS11].

   NEW:

      mac identifies the algorithm and associated parameters of the MAC
      function to be used.  All implementations MUST support HMAC-SHA256
      [HMAC].  All implementations SHOULD support AES-GMAC AES [GMAC]
      with a 128 bit key.

Internet-Draft     CRMF Algorithm Requirements Update      February 2021


   For convenience, the identifiers for these two algorithms are
   repeated here.

   The algorithm identifier for HMAC-SHA256 is defined in [RFC4231]:

      id-hmacWithSHA256 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2)
         us(840) rsadsi(113549) digestAlgorithm(2) 9 }

   When this algorithm identifier is used, the parameters SHOULD be
   present.  When present, the parameters MUST contain a type of NULL.

   The algorithm identifier for AES-GMAC [AES][GMAC] with a 128-bit key
   is defined in [I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-aes-gmac-alg]:

      id-aes128-GMAC OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { joint-iso-itu-t(2)
         country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) csor(3)
         nistAlgorithm(4) aes(1) 9 }

   When this algorithm identifier is used, the parameters MUST be
   present, and the parameters MUST contain the GMACParameters structure
   as follows:

      GMACParameters ::= SEQUENCE {
         nonce        OCTET STRING,
         length       MACLength DEFAULT 12 }

      MACLength ::= INTEGER (12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16)

   The GMACParameters nonce parameter is the GMAC initialization vector.
   The nonce may have any number of bits between 8 and (2^64)-1, but it
   MUST be a multiple of 8 bits.  Within the scope of any GMAC key, the
   nonce value MUST be unique.  A nonce value of 12 octets can be
   processed more efficiently, so that length for the nonce value is
   RECOMMENDED.

   The GMACParameters length parameter field tells the size of the
   message authentication code in octets.  GMAC supports lengths between
   12 and 16 octets, inclusive.  However, for use with CRMF, the maximum
   length of 16 octets MUST be used.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requests of the IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   The security of the password-based MAC relies on the number of times
   the hash function is applied as well as the entropy of the shared
   secret (the password).  Hardware support for hash calculation is
   available at very low cost [PHS], which reduces the protection
   provided by a high iterationCount value.  Therefore, the entropy of
   the password is crucial for the security of the password-based MAC
   function.  In 2010, researchers showed that about half of the real-
   world passwords can be broken with less than 150 million trials,
   indicating a median entropy of only 27 bits [DMR].  Higher entropy
   can be achieved by using randomly generated strings.  For example,
   assuming an alphabet of 60 characters a randomly chosen password with
   10 characters offers 59 bits a entropy, and 20 characters offers 118
   bits of entropy.  Using a one-time password also increases the
   security of the MAC, assuming that the integrity-protected
   transaction will complete before the attacker is able to learn the
   password with an offline attack.

   Cryptographic algorithms age; they become weaker with time.  As new
   cryptanalysis techniques are developed and computing capabilities
   improve, the work required to break a particular cryptographic
   algorithm will reduce, making an attack on the algorithm more
   feasible for more attackers.  While it is unknown how cryptoanalytic
   attacks will evolve, it is certain that they will get better.  It is
   unknown how much better they will become or when the advances will
   happen.  For this reason, the algorithm requirements for CRMF are
   updated by this specification.

   When a Password-Based MAC is used, implementations must protect the
   password and the MAC key.  Compromise of either the password or the
   MAC key may result in the ability of an attacker to undermine
   authentication.
