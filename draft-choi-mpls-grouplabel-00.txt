  Abstract 
  
  As the group communication become more important, the special label 
  should be allocated in support of group management and maintenance. 
  The allocation mechanism of group label can be applied to a point-to-
  multipoint communication in MPLS networks. Currently used label is 
  locally significant, while this special label should be common object 
  within a single MPLS domain. This document specifies the allocation 
  mechanism of group label in order to perform unidirectional point-to-
  multipoint communication.

  Group label allocation mechanism in MPLS network          March 2003 
                      
1. Introduction 
                        
  It is increasingly important to guarantee real-time application 
  requiring more strict QoS and higher bandwidth such as Internet 
  broadcasting, video conferencing and real-time delivery services, 
  therefore the group communication will become very useful for these 
  purposes. The special label should be allocated in support of group 
  management and maintenance. The allocation mechanism of group label 
  can be applied to a point-to-multipoint communication. 
                        
  Currently a variety of research is actively performed to support 
  point-to-multipoint communication focusing on RSVP-TE[4] or CR-LDP[5] 
  in MPLS networks and group label allocation also can be a scheme for 
  configuring MPLS networks.  
                        
  The group label is a common object to establish and maintain the 
  point-to-multipoint connection within a single MPLS domain. We can 
  discuss only unidirectional communication which means that only a 
  single sender creates group label request object requiring a group 
  label. The group label allocation for bidirectional communication is 
  a subject for future study, which means that several LSRs also create 
  group label request objects and send them to a single node. 
                        
2. Related works 
                        
  - RFC 3209, "RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels" 
                          
    This RFC describes the extension of RSVP for establishing traffic 
    engineered path. The proposed mechanism for resource reservation 
    is intended for group communication. 
                          
  - RFC 3353, "Framework for IP Multicast in MPLS" 
                      
    This RFC introduces the extended IP multicast mechanism for L2. It 
    proposes to establish the point-to-multipoint LSP using L3 
    multicasting rouging protocol. This mechanism addresses the 
    concept of group management and the common object identifying 
    among groups. 
                        
 - RFC 3212, "Constraint-Based LSP using LDP" 
   This RFC describes the procedure for establishing traffic 
   engineered path using extended LDP signaling. The proposed 
   mechanism is intended for configuring and negotiating traffic 
   parameters. 
                        
3. Applicability 
                       
  This document is considered as a group label allocation which defines 
  the multicasting support in MPLS networks. Instead of local 
  significant concept of a label, the common group label with a single 
  MPLS network is allocated to support point-to-multipoint

  communication so that interactive broadcasting and Video on demand 
  service can be provided.  
                        
  In view of expenditure and maintenance, it is difficult to realize 
  the multicasting with a group label including server application in 
  backbone MPLS network, while access MPLS network may provide high 
  capacity services such as content delivery, preserving network 
  infrastructure. 
                        
  The globally unique server which manages local servers every MPLS 
  domain will be applicable in the future. So, the enhancement for the 
  point-to-multipoint technology will be gradually achieved from access 
  to backbone MPLS network.  
                      
4. Architecture 
                      
4.1 Point-to-multipoint communication based on client-server model 
                        
  A single Server is equipped with the concept of multipoint control 
  unit (MCU) which can enable two or more receivers to intercommunicate 
  with a single sender like conferencing. So, the point-to-multipoint 
  connection can be established using a single server locally. This 
  server has two functions; one is a merging function for Path message 
  with group label request object and the other is a replication 
  function for Resv message with group label.  
                        
  It is totally reliable and robust to establish this communication 
  because a server manages the traffic engineered explicit routes to 
  avoid link failure before forwarding a Path message from a sender.  
                        
4.1.1 Replication function 
                        
  A Replication function point in the MPLS network is a point in a 
  point-to-multipoint connection where Path message with group label 
  request from one incoming path is replicated on two or more outgoing 
  paths. In MPLS network, a replication function is based on the group 
  label request object. At the replication point each group label 
  request is copied onto two or more outgoing paths. The server checks 
  whether a explicit route is traffic-engineered and then forwards Path 
  message to those routes. If explicit routes are negotiable, server 
  node allocates the Path message with group label request for them, 
  otherwise they cannot be involved in the point-to-multipoint 
  connection.

4.1.2 Merging function 
                        
  A Merging Function point in the MPLS network is a point in a point-
  to-multipoint connection where Resv messages with group label from 
  two or more paths are combined in a single path. In this document, 
  merging function exists in only Resv message since unidirectional 
  point-to-multipoint connection is just supported.

4.1.3 Neighbor information base (NIB) 
                        
  The server contains this database which has IPv4 address/IPv6 address 
  and explicit routes of all LSRs within a single MPLS domain. All of 
  the LSRs in a single MPLS domain periodically sends hello message to 
  the server, therefore the server can maintain and update the 
  information of all LSRs within a MPLS domain. The server use this 
  information to handle a group label request received from a sender. 
                       
4.2 Point-to-multipoint communication based on peer model 
                        
  This model doesn't need any server and hello message for group 
  management because a LSR which wants to establish point-to-multipoint 
  connection can directly send Path message containing group label 
  request to all of the LSRs within a MPLS domain. A LSR which sends 
  Path message doesn't know who will receive. All of the LSRs which 
  received Path message determine whether to join a point-to-multipoint 
  connection. If they accept the request, they send Resv message with 
  group label. Otherwise, they ignore the request. After receiving Resv 
  messages from LSRs, the point-to-multipoint connection between a 
  single sender and multiple receivers can be established within a MPLS 
  domain. The common group label should be used in this communication.  
                       
  In peer model, there are much smaller overhead for messages and 
  maintaining a server with a huge database. On the other hand, the 
  failing possibility to establish a point-to-multipoint connection is 
  much higher than the client-server model, since a server which 
  chooses traffic engineered explicit route between a sender and 
  receivers doesn't exist.

4.3 Unidirectional point-to-multipoint communication mechanism 
                      
4.3.1 Procedures for setting up unidirectional point-to-multipoint 
      communication 
                        
  All of the LSRs within a single MPLS domain can be a sender or 
  receiver. If a sender node is designated, rest of them becomes 
  receivers. There exists a server per MPLS domain. The following is 
  the procedures of setting up unidirectional point-to-multipoint 
  communication.  
                        
  1. All of the LSRS within a single MPLS domain send hello message to 
     a server so that the server can register each IP address and 
     explicit route of each LSR to the NIB. The server has the NIB 
     including IP address and explicit route. So, the server maintains 
     the NIB due to periodical transmission of a hello message. 
                        
  2. If a single LSR sends the Path message containing group label 
     request to a server, all of the LSRs except for a sender become 
     receivers within a MPLS domain. 
                        
  3. After choosing explicit routes registered in NIB, the server 
     copies group label request as the number of chosen explicit route 
     and sends the Path message including group label request.  
                        
  4. Among nodes receiving the Path message containing group label  
     requet, the node which is ready to accept the group label request 
     and join the point-to-multipoint communication allocates group 
     label to the Resv message. 
                        
  5. The server received several Resv messages containing group label 
     performs the merging function. Then, the server creates and send 
     new Resv message containing group label to a sender. 
                        
  6. After distributing the Resv message from multiple receiver to a 
     sender, the point-to-multipoint LSP is established and starts 
     point-to-multipoint communication, which a single sender and two 
     or more receivers are sharing the common group label.

4.3.2 Joining mechanism 
                        
  After establishing point-to-multipoint communication, the following 
  mechanism is applied when a new LSR intends to join this group. 
                       
  - a new LSR sends a join message to a server. 
  
  - The server stores the information extracted from a Join message in 
    NIB and then forwards the join message to the sender. 
    
  - The sender received the join message sends a Path message 
    containing group label request to the server.  
    
  - The server received the Path message sends it to the new LSR if 
    being traffic-negotiable about explicit route. 
    Otherwise, the server sends notification message to the sender and 
    teardown message to the new LSR. 
    
  - The new LSR received the Path message sends Resv message to a 
    server.  
    
  - Then, the server forwards it to the sender and the new LSR can 
    join the point-to-multipoint communication. 
                        
  The procedure of joining mechanism is illustrated in Figure 4.

4.3.3 Leaving mechanism 
                        
  Among LSRs joining the point-to-multipoint communication, the LSR 
  which intends to tear down the connection sends a leave message to a 
  server. The server sends a notification message to the sender and a 
  teardown message to the LSR which requests to leave.  
  The procedure of leaving mechanism is illustrated in Figure 5.

5.1 Path message 
                      
  In case a single LSR within a MPLS domain creates a Path message with 
  label request which requires allocating group label and sends to the 
  server, the rest of LSRS becomes receivers. The server sends Path 
  message along the explicit routes registered in NIB. The modified 
  message is shown in Figure 6.

6.2 Group label object 
                      
  The group label is recognized to all of the LSRs within point-to-
  multipoint label switched path of a single MPLS domain. Since the 
  Path message reserves the traffic engineered explicit registered in 
  NIB, this label may be carried by Resv message and forwarded to the 
  reverse explicit routes. 
  If a node handles the Resv message with the common group label object, 
  this node can join the point-to-multipoint communication. 
  The group label object has the following format: 
                        
  LABEL class = 16, C-Type = 2

6.3 Group label request object 
                      
  To establish a point-to-multipoint communication, the sender creates 
  path message with label request object for group label allocation. 
  This label request object specifies the range of group label and  
  triggers the nodes registered in NIB to allocate a group label and to 
  place the group label of Resv message. The group label must be 
  allocated from that range. The group label request object is shown in 
  Figure 10.

7. Other issues 
  This document specifies that only sender creates the group label 
  request object and sends the Path message with group label request. 
  the rest of LSRs within a single MPLS domain becomes receiver, 
  therefore, it is possible to perform unidirectional point-to-
  multipoint communication. The research for bidirectional point-to-
  multipoint communication remains in the future, which two or more 
  LSRs not only receive Path message from a single node but also create 
  and send Path message to a single node.
