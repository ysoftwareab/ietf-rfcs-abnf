               Adaptive Subscription to YANG Notification
              draft-wang-netconf-adaptive-subscription-07

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG data model and associated mechanism
   enabling subscriber's adaptive subscriptions to a publisher's event
   streams with various different period intervals to report updates.
   Applying these elements allows servers automatically adjust the
   volume of telemetry traffic and rate of traffic sent from publisher
   to the receivers.

1.  Introduction

   YANG-Push subscriptions [RFC8641] allow client applications to
   subscribe to continuous datastore updates without needing to poll.
   It defines a mechanism (i.e.,update trigger) to determine when an
   update record needs to be generated.  Two type of subscriptions are
   introduced in [RFC8641], distinguished by how updates are triggered:
   periodic and on-change.

Internet-Draft            Adaptive Subscription             October 2021


   *  Periodic subscription allows subscribed data to be streamed to the
      destination at a configured fixed periodic interval

   *  On-change subscription allows update to be triggered whenever a
      change in the subscribed information is detected.  The periodic
      interval is set to zero value in the on-change subscription case.

   However in some large scale deployments (e.g., wireless network
   performance monitoring) where an increased data collection rate is
   being used, it becomes more likely that a burst of streamed data may
   temporarily overwhelm a receiver and consume expensive network
   resource (e.g., radio resource).  If the rate at which we can collect
   a stream of data is set too low or getting low priority telemetry
   data dropped, these telemetry data are not sufficient to detect and
   diagnose problems and verify correct network behavior.

   There is a need for a service to configure both clients and servers
   with multiple different period intervals and corresponding
   subscription update policy which allows servers/publishers
   automatically switch to different period intervals according to
   resource usage change without the interaction with the client for
   policy update instruction, e.g., when the wireless signal strength
   falls below a configured low watermark, the subscribed data can be
   streamed at a higher rate while when the wireless signal strength
   crosses a configured high watermark, the subscribed data can be
   streamed at lower rate.

   This document defines a YANG data model and associated mechanism
   enabling subscriber's adaptive subscriptions to a publisher's event
   streams.  Applying these elements allows servers to automatically
   adjust the volume of telemetry traffic and rate of traffic sent from
   publisher to the receivers.

      different period intervals according to the resource usage change
      without the interaction with the client for update policy
      instruction.

2.  Model Overview

   This document defines a YANG module "ietf-adaptive-subscription",
   which augments the "update-trigger" choice defined in the "ietf-yang-
   push" module [RFC8641] with subscription configuration parameters
   that are specific to adaptive subscription.

   In addition to Subscription state notifications defined in [RFC8639]
   and Notifications for Subscribed Content defined in [RFC8641], "ietf-
   adaptive-subscription" YANG module also defines "adaptive-period-
   update" notification to report update interval change.

   The following tree diagrams [RFC8340] provide an overview of the data
   model for "ietf-adaptive-subscription.yang" module.

2.1.  Subscription Configuration

   For adaptive subscriptions, triggered updates will occur at the
   boundaries of specified time intervals when a trigger condition is
   satisfied.  These boundaries can be calculated from the adaptive
   periodic parameters:

   *  a "period" that defines the new duration between push updates, the
      period can be changed based on trigger condition.

Internet-Draft            Adaptive Subscription             October 2021


   *  an "anchor-time" update intervals fall on the points in time that
      are a multiple of a "period" from an "anchor-time".  If an
      "anchor-time" is not provided, then the "anchor-time" MUST be set
      with the creation time of the initial update record.

   *  a "watermark" that defines the threshold value of the targeted
      data object, e.g., it can be lower boundary or upper boundary of
      targeted data object.

   *  a "xpath-external-eval" represents a stanard XPath Evaluation
      criteria (See section 6.4 of [RFC7950]) that is applied against
      the targeted data object, which is used to trigger update interval
      switch in the server.  It follows the rules defined in section 3.4
      of [XPATH1.0] and contains comparisons of datastore node with its
      value to the specific threshold (i.e., watermark) and associated
      logical operation in the XPath format.  Different from stream-
      xpath-filter defined in [RFC8639], it doesn't influence the event
      records output generation from a publisher.

2.2.  YANG RPC

2.2.1.  "establish-subscription" RPC

   The augmentation of YANG module ietf-yang-push made to RPCs specified
   in YANG module ietf-subscribed-notifications [RFC8639] is introduced.
   This augmentation concerns the "establish- subscription" RPC, which
   is augmented with parameters that are needed to specify adaptive
   subscriptions.  These parameters are same as one defined in
   Section 2.1.

2.3.  Notifications for Adaptive Subscribed Content

   The adaptive update notification is similar to Subscription state
   change notifications defined in [RFC8639].  It is inserted into the
   sequence of notification messages sent to a particular receiver.  The
   adaptive update notification cannot be dropped or filtered out, it
   cannot be stored in replay buffers, and it is delivered only to
   impacted receivers of a subscription.  The identification of adaptive
   update notification is easy to separate from other notification
   messages through the use of the YANG extension "subscription-state-
   notif".  This extension tags a notification as a subscription state
   change notification.

   The objects in the 'adpative-update' notification include:

   *  a "period" that defines the duration between push updates, the
      period can be changed based on trigger condition.

Internet-Draft            Adaptive Subscription             October 2021


   *  an "anchor-time"; update intervals fall on the points in time that
      are a multiple of a "period" from an "anchor-time".  If an
      "anchor-time" is not provided, then the "anchor-time" MUST be set
      with the creation time of the initial update record.

   *  A selection filter identifying YANG nodes of interest in a
      datastore.  Filter contents are specified via a reference to an
      existing filter or via an in-line definition for only that
      subscription based on XPath Evaluation criteria defined in section
      6.4 of [RFC7950].  Referenced filters allow an implementation
      avoid evaluating filter acceptability during a dynamic
      subscription request.  The "case" statement differentiates the
      options.  Note that filter contents are not affected by "xpath-
      external-eval" parameter and "watermark" parameter defined by
      update trigger.

3.  Arbitrary XPath Complexity Evaluation

   YANG-Push subscriptions [RFC8641] specifies selection filters to
   identify targeted YANG datastore nodes and/or datastore subtrees for
   which updates are to be pushed.  In addition, it specifies update
   policies that contain conditions that trigger the generation and
   pushing of new update records.  To support adaptive subscription
   defined in this document, the trigger condition can also use similar
   selection filter to express a standard XPath Evaluation criteria
   (section 6.4 of [RFC7950]) against targeted data object.

   Similar to on change subscription, the adaptive subscription are
   particularly effective for data that changes infrequently, the
   following complex design choices need to be cautious, although these
   designs have already been well supported by the section 3.4 of
   [XPATH1.0]:

   *  Support XPath Evaluation criteria against every data objects;

   *  Support any type of node set in the XPath Evaluation criteria,
      e.g., string,int64, uint64, and decimal64 types;

   *  Both objects in the XPath Evaluation criteria to be compared are
      node-sets;

   *  Two objects to be compared are in different data type, e.g., one
      is integer, the other is string

   As described in section 6.4 of RFC7950, Numbers in XPath 1.0 are IEEE
   754 [IEEE754-2008] double-precision floating-point values; some
   values of int64, uint64, and decimal64 types cannot be exactly
   represented in XPath expressions.

Internet-Draft            Adaptive Subscription             October 2021


   If Two Objects to be compared are in different data type, conversion
   function is needed to convert different data type into numbers.

   In both objects in the XPath Evaluation criteria to be compared are
   node-sets, more computation resources are required which add
   complexity.

   To reduce these complexities, the following design principles are
   recommended:

   *  XPath Evaluation criteria against minimal set of data objects in
      the data model, these minimal set of data objects can be
      advertised using Notification capabilities model defined in [I-
      D.netconf-notification-capabilities].

   *  XPath Evaluation criteria only support condition expression that
      filter updates based on numbers.

   *  One object to be compared in the XPath Evaluation criteria MUST be
      nodeset.

   *  The other object to be compared in the XPath Evaluation criteria
      MUST be numbers data type.

   Following the format in [RFC3688], the following registrations are
   requested to be made:

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-adaptive-subscription

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive in some
   network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config) to these
   data nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   *  /sn:subscriptions/sn:subscription/yp:update-trigger/as:adaptive-
      subscriptions/as:adaptive-period/as:watermark

   *  /sn:subscriptions/sn:subscription/yp:update-trigger/as:adaptive-
      subscriptions/as:adaptive-period/as:period

   *  /sn:subscriptions/sn:subscription/yp:update-trigger/as:adaptive-
      subscriptions/as:adaptive-period/as:anchor-time

   *  /sn:establish-subscription/sn:input/yp:update-trigger/as:adaptive-
      subscriptions/as:adaptive-period/as:watermark

   *  /sn:establish-subscription/sn:input/yp:update-trigger/as:adaptive-
      subscriptions/as:adaptive-period/as:period

   *  /sn:establish-subscription/sn:input/yp:update-trigger/as:adaptive-

Appendix B.  Adaptive Subscription and Notification Example

   The examples within this document use the normative YANG module
   "ietf-adaptive-subscription" as defined in Section 4 and the non-
   normative example YANG module "example-wifi-network-diagnostic" as
   defined in Appendix A.1.

   This section shows some typical adaptive subscription and
   notification message exchanges.

B.1.  "edit-config" Example

   The client configures adaptive subscription policy parameters on the
   server.  The adaptive subscription configuration parameters require
   the server to support two update intervals (i.e., 5 seconds, 60
   seconds) and scan all clients every 60 seconds in the sampling window
   if the rssi value of client is greater than or equal to -65dB in the
   sampling window; If the rssi value of client is less than -65dB,
   switch to 5 seconds period value, and then scan all clients every 60
   seconds.

B.2.  Create Adaptive Subscription Example

   The subscriber sends an "establish-subscription" RPC with the
   parameters listed in to request the creation of a adaptive
   subscription.  The adaptive subscription configuration parameters
   require the server to scan all clients every 5 seconds if the rssi
   value of client is less than -65dB; If the rssi value of client is
   great than or equal to -65dB, switch to 60 seconds period value, and
   then report all clients every 60 seconds or scan every 5 seconds,
   collect 12 measurement values but report the last measurement value
   or average value of 12 measurement values.  (Section 2)

   <netconf:rpc message-id="101"
    xmlns:netconf="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
    <establish-subscription
     xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-subscribed-notifications"
     xmlns:yp="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-yang-push">
     <yp:datastore
      xmlns:ds="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-datastores">
             ds:running
     </yp:datastore>
     <yp:datastore-xpath-filter
      xmlns:wnd="https://example.com/sample-data/1.0">
          /wnd:example-wifi-network-diagnostic
     </yp:datastore-xpath-filter>
     <as:adaptive-subscriptions
      xmlns:as="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-adaptive-subscription">
      <as:adaptive-period>
      <as:xpath-external-eval>wnd:server[rssi &lt; -65]
            </as:xpath-external-eval>
       <as:watermark>-65</as:watermark>
       <as:period>5</as:period>
      </as:adaptive-period>
      <as:adaptive-period>
       <as:xpath-external-eval>wnd:server[rssi &ge; -65]
       </as:xpath-external-eval>
       <as:watermark>-65</as:watermark>
       <as:period>60</as:period>
      </as:adaptive-period>
     </as:adaptive-subscriptions>
    </establish-subscription>
   </netconf:rpc>

   In another example, the adaptive subscription configuration
   parameters could also require the server to scan all clients every 5
   seconds and report if the difference between maximum value of client
   rssi and minimum value of client rssi is greater than 0.20 dB in the
   sampling window; If the difference between maximum value of client

Internet-Draft            Adaptive Subscription             October 2021


   rssi and minimum value of client rssi is less than 0.20 dB, switch to
   60 seconds period value and then scan all clients every 60 seconds
   and report the last measurement value.  If the difference between
   maximum value of client rssi and minimum value of client rssi is
   greater than or equal to 0.20 dB in two consecutive sampling windows,
   then in the second sampling window, only report the measurement value
   not reported by the previous sampling window.

B.3.  "adaptive-period-update" notification example

   Upon the server switches to from the update interval 5 seconds to the
   new update interval 60 seconds, Before sending event records to
   receivers, the "adaptive-update" notification should be generated and
   sent to the receivers to inform the receivers that the update
   interval value is switched to the new value.
