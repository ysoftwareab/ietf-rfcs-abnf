                   Segment Routing in IP RAN use case
                 draft-kh-spring-ip-ran-use-case-01.txt

Abstract

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  An
   ingress node steers a packet through a controlled set of
   instructions, called segments, by pre-pending the packet with an SR
   header.  A segment can represent any instruction, topological or
   service-based.  A segment can have a local semantic to an SR node or
   global within an SR domain.  SR allows one to enforce a flow through
   any topological path and service chain while maintaining per-flow
   state only at the ingress node of the SR domain.  This document
   introduces the segment routing in IP Radio Access Network (IP RAN,
   mobile backhaul network) use case.  Additional requirements to
   support segment routing in the IP RAN scenarios are discussed.

1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  An
   ingress node steers a packet through a controlled set of
   instructions, called segments, by pre-pending the packet with an SR
   header.  A segment can represent any instruction, topological or
   service-based.  A segment can have a local semantic to an SR node or
   global within an SR domain.  Segment Routing allows one to enforce a
   flow through any topological path and service chaining while
   maintaining per-flow state only at the ingress node to the Segment
   Routing domain

   The Segment Routing architecture is described in
   ([I-D.filsfils-rtgwg-segment-routing]) The Segment Routing control
   plane is agnostic to the data plane, and hence it can be applied to
   both MPLS (and its many variants) and IPv6.

   Seamless MPLS([I-D.ietf-mpls-seamless-mpls])describes an architecture
   which can be used to extend MPLS networks to integrate access and
   core/aggregation networks into a single MPLS domain.  It provides a

   highly flexible and a scalable architecture and the possibility to
   integrate hundreds of thousands of nodes.

   This document describes the possibility of applying the segment
   routing technology to the IP RAN scenario.  The segment routing could
   simplify the network complexity in case of IP RAN.  LDP and RSVP-TE
   signaling protocols are not required, and the end-to-end service
   deployment can be achieved very easily.

                         Figure 1: IP RAN Network Scenario

   A typical mobile backhaul network is shown as figure 1.  In the
   mobile backhaul network, being different from the typical access
   devices(DSLAM, MSAN), CSGs and RSGs of the mobile backhaul network
   needs to support rich MPLS features such as path design, protection
   switch, OAM, etc.

3.2.  Requirements for IP RAN network

   (1)  End-to-end transport LSP: MPLS based forwarding SHALL be
        provided by the Seamless MPLS based infrastructure between any
        nodes.  The MPLS based service could be setup by L3VPN, L2VPN or
        pseudo wire.

   (2)  OAM: The Seamless MPLS architecture should propose unified OAM
        mechanisms to satisfy the requirements of the end-to-end
        services.

   (3)  Protection: The protection switch mechanism has been provided in
        IP RAN network to achieve convergence in 50 ms.

   (4)  Scalability: With the proliferation of 3G/LTE, more and more
        node-Bs are deployed.  IP/MPLS equipment in IP RAN network are
        very huge.  In addition, there is more complex configuration for
        IP RAN network, because of the richer MPLS TE properties/
        features requirements.  So there is more challenge in scaling
        the IP RAN network.

   (5)  Security: The session security should be better or at least as
        good as in traditional IP/MPLS network.

Internet-Draft             SR IP RAN use case                  June 2014


   (6)  Survivability: The survivability should be better or at least as
        good as in traditional IP/MPLS network.

   (7)  Flexibility and Overheads: The additional overheads, if any, due
        to using SR should be offset by the flexibility provided by the
        SR in IP RANs.

4.  Benefit for segment routing in IP RAN network

   (1)  Simplify end-to-end LSP tunnel establishment: The data plane in
        IP RAN network is MPLS based forwarding.  Segment routing
        technology is based on MPLS data plane, and there is no change
        for MPLS forwarding, so the data plane in IP RAN could use the
        segment routing forwarding technology.  Segment routing simplify
        the control plane by IGP protocol distribution, there is no need
        for RSVP-TE and LDP signaling protocol.  RSVP-TE, LDP protocol
        usually run in an AS, while IP-RAN network may cross AS domains.
        Therefore the cross-AS issue should be considered in the IP-RAN,
        and this is a very complex issue.  Segment routing uses IGP
        protocol to distribute SID, and hence there is no cross-AS issue
        for segment routing.  The BGP protocol could be extended to
        distribute SID in
        ([I-D.gredler-idr-bgp-ls-segment-routing-extension]) SR as well.
        The segment routing technology can simplify end-to-end LSP
        tunnel establishment.

   (2)  Network virtualization: Service chaining could be introduced
        into SR domain.  An SR header could be used to carry the set of
        forwarding or services that need to be applied to the packet.
        This can be achieved by creating an SR header with the desired
        sequence of service IDs that need to be applied to the packet.

   (3)  Unified OAM mechanism: OAM mechanism could be implemented across
        AS by IGP and BGP extension of SID flooding.  This is an easy-
        to-implement the cross-AS OAM mechanism.  If the control plane
        is one or several centralized controller, the OAM policy can be
        determined by the controller, and the related OAM policy can be
        downloaded to the SR nodes seamlessly

   (4)  Traffic engineering: Traffic Engineering has been widely
        addressed by using the IGP protocol extensions (for resources
        information propagation) and RSVP-TE for signaling explicit
        paths.  Different contexts and modes have been defined (single
        vs. multiple domains, with or without bandwidth admission
        control, centralized vs. distributed path computation, etc),
        segment routing can help to implement traffic engineering in IP
        RAN network.

Internet-Draft             SR IP RAN use case                  June 2014


   (5)  FRR: FRR technologies have been deployed by network operators in
        order to cope with link or node failures through pre-computation
        of backup paths.  Segment routing can use the IP FRR technology
        to simplify MPLS-TE
        FRR([I-D.francois-spring-resiliency-use-case]).

   (6)  Flexible policy deployment: A key goal for SR is to steer a
        packet to follow a specific path through the network.  It is
        possible to control the service performed at each SR node that
        is forwarding the packets.  Forwarding is one such service
        provided by an SR node.  The service policy can be applied to
        the packets in each SR node.

   (7)  Simplification of management and operations: The complex RSVP-TE
        and LDP signaling protocol are not required in the IP RAN
        network anymore.  Therefore, the configuration and operation
        management become much simple than tradition RSVP-TE based IP
        RAN network.

   (8)  Centralization controller or distribution protocol: the control
        plane in IP RAN network can be IGP/BGP distribution protocol or
        centralization controller.

5.  Unified Service Deployment

   The centralization controller is supported in problem statement draft
   ([I-D.previdi-spring-problem-statement]) this section describe how
   centralization controller is applied to the IP RAN network for
   unified service deployment.

                         Figure 2: Centralization of Controller


   Figure 2 shows an architecture for centralization of controller.  The
   control plane is separated from the forwarding plane.  IP RAN
   Controller is a software system that can be deployed either in a
   network device or a separate computer server.  IP RAN controllers
   control the entire IP RAN network domain, the size of the domain can
   be defined by Network Operator based on the actual network planning
   and use cases.  IP RAN controllers manage the IP RAN network based on
   the network topology, actual states and status, which are operated by
   the network administrator.  The controller provide the northbound
   interface to network management system used for service deployment,
   monitoring, troubleshooting, fault location, etc.

   CSG, ASG and RSG (we call them forwarding nodes) are only responsible
   for MPLS stack forwarding.  RSVP-TE and LDP signaling protocol are
   not required in these forwarding nodes.  They only need to support
   topology collecting and report them to controller.  Forwarding nodes
   keep the basic routing functions in order to establish control and
   management channel between IP RAN Controller/NMG and all the
   forwarding nodes accepts network resources and states from the
   controller.

5.1.  Requirement for Control Node

   The logical centralization controller is introduced in the IP RAN
   network.  Centralization controller is responsible for network
   topology collecting and label distribution based on the service.

   Requirement for control node:

   (1)  Control node should support collecting network topology, and
        managing network resource, route computing, and MPLS label
        distribution.

   (2)  Control node support service chaining.

   (3)  Control node support secure channel, and it should establish the
        secure connection between forwarding node.

5.2.  Requirement for Forwarding Node

5.2.1.  Forwarding Node Structure

   The forwarding node structure in segment routing based IP RAN network
   is as following:

   as signal protocol component, signal label database, and a new
   component Control Agent is introduced to communicate with the
   centralization Controller.

   Control Agent: control agent is used to communicate with the
   centralization controller.  The forwarding node reports its topology
   and resource information, and receives the label distributed and
   policy through control agent.  The control agent establishes the
   secure channel with controller.  The BGP-LS protocol is recommended
   to use as the communication protocol between control agent and
   controller in this document.

   Config: the config component is used for management and
   configuration.  It is the interface with network management.

   Routing: is the traditional component, is used for route computing.
   The routing protocol (ISIS, OSPF, and BGP) is required for the
   forwarding node.

   Topo management: Topology management is responsible for topology
   computing, and topology status reporting.

   TEDB: The label database.

   Policy DB: policy database.
