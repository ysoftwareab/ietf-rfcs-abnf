1. Introduction 

   With the deployment of IP video multicast service, there is an 
   increasing demand for the performance monitoring for providers' 
   multicast network.  The benefits of performance monitoring are to 
   guarantee the service level agreement (SLA) provided to the customers, 
   to discover the network performance defects proactively, to react in 
   response to the failure quickly, and further to optimize the network 
   resources utilizations.  

   This document describes an IP multicast network performance 
   monitoring solution referred to as Inline Real Stream Monitoring 
   (IRSM) based on the requirements given in [2].  IRSM is proposed to 
   meet the service provider's manageability requirements on 
   increasingly deployed multicast network.  It enables efficient 
   measurement of performance metrics of a multicast channel and 
   provides diagnostic information in case of performance degradation or 
   failure.

3. Characteristics of IRSM 

   IRSM currently utilizes packet Loss Measurement (LM) and packet Delay 
   Measurement (DM) to accomplish performance monitoring.  It has 
   following features desirable as a carrier-grade monitoring scheme, as 
   required in [2]:

   o Independency - It is operated independently from multicast 
   forwarding plane and control plane and it does not have bad 
   influences on the running of the two planes. 

   o Real stream - The data to be monitored is from real multicast 
   stream, usually specified by (S,G) or (*,G) pairs.   

   o Inline - It enables the on-the-spot measurement or monitoring when 
   carrier network is loaded with customer multicast traffic. 

   o Inband - The OAM measurement packet is routed following strictly 
   the same multicast forwarding path as the monitored multicast stream, 
   which help gathering the true network forwarding metrics. 

   o End-to-End and per segment measurement - It is capable of 
   monitoring the whole end-to-end forwarding path from one multicast 
   root to one or more leaf nodes, which provides the path performance 
   for a particular multicast stream as a whole.  It also supports 
   measurement for each segment (i.e. a forwarding branch, a forwarding 
   node or the combination of them) of a multicast forwarding path.  The 
   features enable the monitoring of a whole multicast tree, of one or 
   more forwarding paths, and of parts of the tree or path(s).  

   o Proactive and on-demand modes - It is capable of carrying out a 
   measurement session proactively or on demand according to the 
   configured management policy.  

4. Principle of IRSM  

4.1. Measurement Architecture 

   Three functional entities are defined in IRSM measurement 
   architecture: MEP-I (Maintenance Entity Point - Ingress), MIP 
   (Maintenance Intermediate Point) and MEP-E (Maintenance Entity Point 
   - Egress).  They are logical entities that can be configured on the 
   incoming or outgoing interfaces of the monitoring equipments.  The 
   relationship of these entities is illustrated in figure 1.

          Figure 1.  The relationship of MEP and MIP entities 

   The basic function of MEP-I is to initiate a measurement session.  It 
   generates OAM measurement packets.  During a packet loss measurement, 
   MEP-I takes count of the transmitted packets from a specific 
   multicast stream and sends out the Loss Measurement (LM) message 
   along the multicast path carrying this packet count.  For delay 
   measurement, MEP-I generates the Delay Measurement (DM) message 
   recording the locally generated timestamp. 

   MEP-E is the end point of the measurement path.  It terminates the 
   OAM measurement packets and measures the end-to-end packet loss or 
   delay from MEP-I to MEP-E.  MEP-E calculates the packet loss from 
   MEP-I according to local packet count of the stream and the packet 
   count in the received LM packet sent by MEP-I, and calculates the 
   delay from MEP-I by comparing the timestamp carried in the DM message 
   and local time for receiving this message. 

   MIP entity locates between MEP-I and MEP-E and forward OAM packets 
   from upstream MEP-I to downstream MEP-E(s).  It is optionally 
   configured on the intermediate node of a multicast forwarding path.  
   If MIP function is not enabled on the intermediate nodes, then only 
   end-to-end measurement is available.  Otherwise if MIP is enabled on 
   an intermediate node, it can perform the measurement segment by 
   segment through snooping the OAM measurement packets.  MIP calculates 
   the packet loss and the packet delay from MEP-I to itself in the same 
   way as the MEP-E node does. 

   If MIP-I is configured on the root node and MEP-E configured on the 
   leaf node, then the monitored path is a complete multicast forward 
   path, as shown in figure 1.  If MIP-I or MIP-E is configured on an 
   intermediate node, then part of the multicast path could be monitored.

4.2. Packet Loss Measurement 

   Packet loss measurement could be performed proactively or on demand 
   according to the configuration of a measurement session.  In 
   proactive mode, LM packet will be transmitted by MEP-I continuously 
   with a specific time interval.  For on-demand mode, LM will be sent 
   based on a specified schedule, which could be periodically, or based 
   on a pre-arranged schedule.  If the schedule is for a single 
   measurement, then two LM messages are required to be generated to 
   perform this packet loss detection. 

   When a measurement session starts, MEP-I counts the transmitted 
   packets from a multicast data stream within a time interval.  If the 
   counting timer expires, MEP-I generates a LM packet carrying this 
   transmitted packet count (say Tx_C1) of the tested multicast stream.  
   The LM packet is inserted into the data stream, and forwarded in the 
   same way as a real multicast data packet.  

   If MIP function is enabled on an intermediate node, it will snoop the 
   measurement packets and count the received data packets locally.  On 
   receiving a LM packet, it records the current local packet count (say 
   Rx_C1) and the transmitted packet count Tx_C1 in the received LM 
   packet.  And after receiving a subsequent LM packet, it takes the 
   same action as above to acquire the local packet count (say Rx_C2) 
   and the transmitted packet count carried in this LM packet (say 
   Tx_C2).  The packet loss is calculated as (Tx_C2-Tx_C1)-(Rx_C2-Rx_C1).  
   The calculation could be performed in a process component within 
   (e.g., a dedicated process component) or outside (e.g., NMS) the MIP 
   node. 

   Each MIP and MEP-E node on the path could obtain the packet loss 
   statistics of the path from MEP-I to itself by this means and both 
   per-segment and end-to-end performance monitoring are available 
   within a measurement session.  The integration of the overall 
   measurement results could help to detect and locate the failure 
   point(s) and the performance bottle point(s) along the forwarding 
   path. 

4.3. Packet Delay Measurement 

   Time synchronization among the measuring entities is required for 
   packet delay measurement.  The measurement process of DM is almost 
   the same as packet loss measurement.  It can be operated proactively 
   or on-demand.  The only difference is that the process is based on a 
   timestamp value other than a packet counter.

   When a measurement session starts, MEP-I generates DM packets 
   carrying the local timestamps and sends them onto the multicast path. 
   The DM packets are forwarded in the same way as the normal multicast 
   data. 

   Similarly, if MIP function is enabled in an intermediate node, it 
   will snoop the DM packet to get the timestamps of the time when 
   sending the DM packets at MEP-I.  On receipt of a DM packet, the MIP 
   node records the local timestamp (say Rx_T1) and the timestamp (say 
   Tx_T1) carried in the received DM packet. The packet delay between 
   MEP-I and MIP could be calculated as (Rx_T1- Tx_T1).  The calculation 
   could be performed in a process component within (e.g., a dedicated 
   process component) or outside (e.g., NMS) the MIP node. 

   Each MIP and MEP-E could acquire the packet delay information from 
   MEP-I to itself.  By this means it is able to perform per-segment and 
   end-end delay measurement within a single measurement session, which 
   helps detection and isolation of performance defect points. 

5. Message Format 

   IRSM measurement messages are encapsulated in IP packets.  A 
   dedicated IP protocol type in IP header could be used to identify the 
   IRSM measurement packets.  Currently two messages types are utilized: 
   Loss Measurement message and Delay Measurement message.  The data 
   part of an IRSM message adopts the popular Type-Length-Value 
   structure, as shown in figure 2. 

   Type - the type of the OAM message. 

       0, LM - Loss Measurement message 

       1, DM - Delay Measurement message 

       2-255, reserved for future use 

   Length - the length of the OAM message, not including the common IP 
       header, the Type field and the Length field itself. 

   Value - the content of a specific OAM messages except for the Type 
   and the Length field.

6.1. Fault Detection and Location Based on LM 

   The sending and processing of LM packets by MEP and MIP enable the 
   fault detection and location for performance monitoring.  Suppose in 
   figure 5, the link C-E between router1 and router2 has performance 
   bottleneck which causes packet losses.  Based on the method given in 
   section 4.2, all the monitoring entities on the downstream of the 
   link will perceive this loss.  Because the downstream entities (i.e. 
   MIP5, MIP6, MIP7, MEP-E2, MEP-E3) detect the packet losses, whereas 
   the upstream entities (i.e. MIP1 and MIP2) do not, it can be inferred 
   that the link between C and E are suffering from performance problem. 

   The degradation of an intermediate node can also be detected and 
   isolated in this way.  For example if router2 has forwarding defect 
   which introduces packet loss, by snooping LM messages and counting 
   locally received packets, MIP6, MIP7, MEP-E2, and MEP-E3 will detect 
   the packet loss while the upstream MIP1, MIP2 and MIP5 will not.  The 
   fault point of router2 will be easily located.  

   It is even possible to detect multiple point failures along the 
   multicast forwarding path, if such errors occur.  In figure 5, if

   link C-E and H-J both undergo packet losses, all the entities down 
   from the C-E will detect the defects.  But as MIP7 and MEP-E3 have 
   different packet loss values from MIP5, additional fault point of 
   link H-J could be easily picked out. 

6.2. Fault Detection and Location Based on DM 

   The fault detection and location principle of the packet delay 
   measurement is the same as that of packet loss measurement given in 
   section 6.1.  If the link or node has defects that cause packet delay 
   increasing, their downstream MIPs and MEP-Es will perceive them.  If 
   the delay value rises over a reasonable threshold level, then it can 
   be judged that the link or node is undergoing performance abnormities.  
   The DM could be operated to support single-point link and node 
   detection, multipoint link and node detection, as long as the 
   forwarding path is equipped with enough monitoring entities. 

7.  Deployment Considerations 

   When IRSM is deployed in practical network, many issues should be 
   considered to enable the scheme to work efficiently.  Here are 
   emulated some of the key aspects that should be paid special 
   attention to when implementing IRSM. 

7.1. Acquisition of monitored stream 

   Because LM needs to take count of the data packet from a real stream, 
   an IRSM-enabled node must provide the means to acquire the monitored 
   multicast stream.  In practice this could be implemented by an ACL 
   method.  If the stream to be monitored is specified by an (S,G) or a 
   (*,G) pair, the ACL policy could be set to permit the packets belong 
   to this stream to be processed by the IRSM module.  

7.2. Identification of OAM packets 

   Because LM and DM OAM packets are forwarded along the real forwarding 
   path, MIP and MEP-E nodes should be able to recognize them from 
   normal multicast data.  In section 5, a dedicated IP protocol number 
   is suggested to be assigned to be used by OAM packets.  There is 
   another choice that a UDP port number is assigned to make this 
   identification.  Using UDP port requires the intermediate MIP node to 
   look deeper into an OAM packet, which introduces additional 
   processing burden on MIP nodes.

7.3. Alarm and Reporting Processing 

   The alarming and reporting method in case of abnormal and normal 
   status should be in the scope of network planning and should be 
   designed according to the local policy of the management and the 
   scale of the multicast tree.  To prevent alarm and report from 
   overburdening the network and the NMS systems, the amount of these 
   messages generated should be minimized. 

   In IRSM performance monitoring, a feasible scheme is to let only the 
   MEP-E entities alarm the exception state when packet loss or 
   unacceptable packet delay is detected.  MIP nodes only log the 
   exception and will only send report to the management system 
   regularly or passively in response to the queries.  It needs further 
   study on how to design in detail the alarming and reporting functions 
   of an IRSM system. 

7.4. Configuration of Monitoring Nodes 

   IRSM performance monitoring system should be flexible enough for the 
   provider to operate.  For example, the provider may at this time 
   prefer proactively monitoring and in other occasions need to take 
   some discrete tests on demand.  He may choose to monitor the whole 
   multicast tree, only some important forwarding paths or branches, or 
   even merely several nodes prone to performance degradation.  An IRSM-
   capable node should be able to be enabled or disabled its monitoring 
   function as required by a configuration operation to support this 
   flexibility. 

   The configuration should also be used to provide the parameters of a 
   monitoring session, such as the OAM execution frequency, the starting 
   or ending of a monitoring session, the multicast stream to be 
   monitored, etc.  The configuration could be implemented as the manual 
   manner by an administrator, or by a control plane protocol.  The 
   latter has the advantages of flexibility and scalability.  It is for 
   further study on how to realize a practical configuration control. 

7.5. Topology Discovery  

   Topology discovery is the precondition of the monitoring of a 
   multicast tree.  IRSM administrator could make use of current 
   available multicast tree topology discovery tool in a multicast 
   management system.  If this is unavailable, it is possible to define 
   a lightweight tool specific for IRSM uses.

7.6. Interoperation Among Different Vendors 

   If equipments from different vendors are deployed in the same 
   multicast tree or on the same multicast forwarding path, cares should 
   be taken to interoperate them well to fulfill the performance 
   monitoring task.  Because the LM and DM packets are treated normally 
   as the multicast data packets, the only interoperability requirement 
   is that those intermediate IRSM-incapable equipments do not discard 
   the LM or DM packets.  

8. Security Considerations 

   IRSM system should provide security support to meet the requirements 
   of a performance monitoring management system.  These aspects will be 
   discussed in the future version of the memo. 

9. IANA Considerations 

   If IP Protocol in IP header is used as the Identification of IRSM OAM 
   packets, then new IP protocol value is required to be assigned by 
   IANA. 

   If UDP port number in UDP header is used as the identification of 
   IRSM OAM packets, then new UDP value is required to be assigned by 
   IANA.
