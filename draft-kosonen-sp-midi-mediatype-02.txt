Abstract 
 
   The MIDI Manufacturers Association (MMA) and the Association of Music 
   Electronics industry (AMEI) have produced the Scalable Polyphony MIDI 
   (SP-MIDI) standard [n1].  SP-MIDI has been approved for 3GPP 
   standardization and a dedicated SP-MIDI profile has been defined for 
   3GPP SP-MIDI devices [n2].  Since MIDI information is a very compact 
   media type, 3GPP is initially focusing on the application of SP-MIDI 
   for music downloading and messaging applications that require MIME 
   registration.

Internet-Draft               SP-MIDI MIME             22 December 2006 
 
 
1.  Introduction 
 
   MIDI content is commonly used in the Internet.  However, such use is 
   based on informal ad hoc MIME type definitions that have not been 
   registered by IETF.  The present MIME type registration is harmonized 
   with the typical Internet usage of unregistered audio/midi and 
   audio/x-midi MIME types.  Commonly, MIDI information is stored in the 
   Standard MIDI File (SMF) format [n3].  The present MIME type 
   registration also uses the SMF format for the encapsulation of SP-
   MIDI data.  Whereas previous MIDI specifications have been based on 
   common minimum requirements for all playback devices supporting the 
   same specification, SP-MIDI is able to support a wider range of 
   playback devices because playback adaptations can be encoded in the 
   MIDI content.  Due to this difference, a separate MIME type, 
   audio/sp-midi needs to be registered to distinguish SP-MIDI content. 
 
2.  Registration of audio/sp-midi 
 
   Type name: audio 
 
   Subtype name: sp-midi 
 
   Required parameters: none 
 
   Optional parameters: none 
    
   Encoding considerations: 
    
      sp-midi data is binary data and must be encoded for non-binary 
      transport; Base64 is suitable for Email. 
    
   Security considerations: 
    
      Many synthetic audio compositions have associated intellectual 
      property rights.  It is conceivable that the rights owners of sp-
      midi content will want to protect their rights by applying 
      security mechanisms that prohibit the rendering of the content 
      without a legally acquired license to do so.  These mechanisms 
      would be applied externally to the Content-Type defined here; sp-
      midi content itself is not encrypted internally.  sp-midi streams 
      do not contain executable content.  sp-midi players are robust 
      against corrupted sp-midi content, because sp-midi players ignore 
      unidentified content.

   Interoperability considerations: 
    
      Scalable Polyphony MIDI (SP-MIDI) is a Musical Instrument Digital 
      Interface (MIDI) specification developed by MMA and AMEI.  SP-MIDI 
      is based on the MIDI 1.0 specification [n3], which standardizes a 
      protocol for the electronic transmission of music performance data 
      suitable for communication between a transmitter and receiver 
      using MIDI messages.  SP-MIDI data is stored in Standard MIDI 
      Files (SMF) [n3]. 
       
      The SP-MIDI format [n1] provides a scalable representation of MIDI 
      content enabling broadly interoperable music applications.  SP-
      MIDI files have encoded information about playback requirements 
      allowing SP-MIDI playback devices with different device 
      capabilities to play the same content according to the composer's 
      polyphony requirements and Channel priority order definitions.  
      SP-MIDI player requirements are specified in separate SP-MIDI 
      profile specifications [n2] defining the supported MIDI messages 
      and device requirement.  All SP-MIDI profiles follow the 
      definitions of the SP-MIDI specification [n1]. 
       
      MMA and AMEI have previously defined the General MIDI (GM) system 
      standards GM1 [i4] GM2 [i5], and GML [i6].  These specifications 
      are technically related to the SP-MIDI specification, but do not 
      support polyphony scalability.  Due to the differences between GM 
      and SP-MIDI systems, GM synthesizers do not support all SP-MIDI 
      content.  Likewise, not all SP-MIDI synthesizers support all GM 
      content.  Thus, a separate MIME definition is needed to 
      distinguish SP-MIDI from the informally used audio/midi content.

   Applications which use this media type: 
    
      SP-MIDI is a synthetic audio format for the flexible presentation 
      of MIDI data on a wide range of playback devices, particularly 
      portable appliances such as mobile phones, PDAs, and palmtop 
      computers.
