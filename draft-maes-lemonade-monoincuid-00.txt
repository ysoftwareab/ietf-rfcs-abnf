Abstract 
    
   MONOINCUID defines an extension to the IMAPv4 Rev1 protocol [RFC3501] 
   for optimization in a mobile setting, aimed at delivering extended 
   functionality for mobile devices with limited resources. To reduce 
   client complexity, the IMAP UID in a server compliant to MONOINCUID 
   are fixed and monotonically increasing.   
 
Conventions used in this document 
    
   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and 
   server respectively. 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 
    
   An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or more 
   of the MUST or REQUIRED level requirements for the protocol(s) it 
   implements. An implementation that satisfies all the MUST or REQUIRED 
   level and all the SHOULD level requirements for a protocol is said to 
   be "unconditionally compliant" to that protocol; one that satisfies 
   all the MUST level requirements but not all the SHOULD level 
   requirements is said to be "conditionally compliant."  When 
   describing the general syntax, some definitions are omitted as they 
   are defined in [RFC3501].

1.    Introduction 
    
   The Push-IMAP protocol (P-IMAP) is based on IMAPv4 Rev1 [RFC3501], 
   but contains additional enhancements for simplification of the 
   client. This is achieved by imposing that IMAP UID in a server 
   compliant to MONOINCUID are fixed and monotonically increasing. This 
   takes into account the limited resources of mobile devices, as well 
   as extra functionality desired.  
    
   MONOINCUID contributes also to supporting unstable mobile connections 
   by allowing the client to determine easily missing events and changes 
   based on gaps or changes in the UID sequences.  
 
2.   Revisions to IMAPv4 Rev1 Behavior 
    
   The section describes the differences between how an IMAPv4 Rev1 
   server vs. a server compliant to MONOINCUID.  
     
   A compliant server must implement all the commands in IMAPv4 Rev1, 
   with these revisions.  The IMAPv4Rev1 syntax on commands and 
   responses are found in sections 6 and 7 in [RFC3501].   
    
2.1.     UID 
    
   As specified in RFC 3501, section 2.3.1.1, "The unique identifier of 
   a message MUST NOT change during the session, and SHOULD NOT change 
   between sessions."  Changing the UID of email messages imposes a very 
   heavy computational and bandwidth burden on a mobile client. For a  
   server compliant to MONOINCUID, the UID MUST always monotonically 
   increase. It MUST remain unchanged between sessions and monotonically 
   increase. It MAY also increase without gaps in its sequence. 
    
3.   The CAPABILITY Command 
    
   The CAPABILITY command is defined in RFC3501, section 6.1.1.  The 
   client sends a CAPABILITY command so it can query the server to find 
   out what commands it supports.  In RFC3501, the IMAP server is 
   allowed to specify additional capabilities not included in that 
   specification.  A server that supports MONOINCUID conforms to that 
   requirement, and MUST list that it supports MONOINCUID.

   A server can also enumerate individually the other commands that it 
   supports.  
    
   capability_cmd =  tag SP "CAPABILITY"  
   Valid States:  NOT AUTHENTICATED, AUTHENTICATED, SELECTED, or LOGOUT 
   Responses:  REQUIRED untagged response: CAPABILITY 
   Result:  OK - capability completed 
      BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid 
    
   Example: A P-IMAP server that implements MONOINCUID.  
      C: a001 CAPABILITY 
      S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 AUTH=LOGIN IDLE MONOINCUID 
      S: a001 OK CAPABILITY completed 
    
Security Considerations 
    
   MONOINCUID does not introduce additional security consideration with 
   respect to IMAPv4Rev1.
