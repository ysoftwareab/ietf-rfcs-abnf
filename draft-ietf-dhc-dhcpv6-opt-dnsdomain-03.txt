Internet-Draft      domain suffix option for DHCPv6            June 2006


1.  Introduction

   This document describes a new option for DHCPv6 [RFC3315] that 
   provides a mechanism for specifying a domain name suffix. Using this
   option, the DHCPv6 server can specify a domain name suffix to the 
   DHCPv6 client. 

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document should be read in conjunction with the DHCPv6 
   specification, [RFC3315]. Definitions for terms and acronyms used in
   this document are defined in RFC3315.


2.  Domain Suffix Option

   The domain suffix option for DHCPv6 is used by the DHCPv6 server to 
   tell the DHCPv6 client the domain suffix that the DHCPv6 server 
   administrator has specified for that DHCPv6 client.

   The format of the domain suffix option is:

     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |          option-code          |         option-length         |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                                                               |
    ~                          domain suffix                        ~
    |                                                               |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   option-code:     OPTION_DOMAIN_SUFFIX (TBD).

   option-length:   length of the "domain suffix" field in octets.

   domain suffix:   the specification of a domain suffix.

   The domain suffix in the 'domain suffix' field MUST include only one
   item, and MUST be encoded as specified in the section of RFC3315 
   titled "Representation and use of domain names".

Internet-Draft      domain suffix option for DHCPv6            June 2006
   
2.1  Usage
 
   A DHCPv6 client MUST include the option code in Option Request 
   Option [RFC3315] if it desires the domain suffix option, and the 
   DHCPv6 server SHOULD include this option in an Advertise or Reply 
   if requested by the client in the Option Request Option.
   
   A DHCPv6 server may provide different values for the domain suffix
   option to different clients.  The mechanism for choosing which
   suffix to assign to which client is a matter of implementation and 
   administrative policy, and is therefore not specified in this 
   document.

      
3.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations in DHCP are described in section 23,
   "Security Considerations" of RFC3315.
 

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a DHCPv6 option code for the 
   OPTION_DOMAIN_SUFFIX.
