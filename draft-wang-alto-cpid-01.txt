An Aggregate Network and Cost Map (CPID) Extension for the ALTO Protocol
                        draft-wang-alto-cpid-01

Abstract

   The goal of the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)
   protocol is to provide guidance to applications which have to select
   one or several hosts from a set of candidates, all of which are able
   to provide the desired resource.  The goal of the mechanisms
   specified in this document is to extend the existing solution, and
   provide basic attributes to each end terminal to make it network-
   aware.  These mechanisms introduce a way to directly transfer the
   guidance or costs using Network Location identifiers/PIDs, called
   CPIDs.  And the exisiting The proposed solution inherits the existing
   solution's architecture, messages, and other mechanisms.  It can be
   used as an independent solution or function together with other
   functions in the existing solution to provide guidance for different
   client and balance the workload on the server.  Additional details
   for the process will be provided in the next version of the draft.

Internet-Draft        CPID ALTO Protocol Extension             July 2010


1.  Introduction

   Many Internet applications, including widely used overlay
   applications for peer-to-peer file sharing and video streaming, need
   to access resources available in several equivalent replicas on
   different hosts, for example pieces of information or server
   processes.  The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)
   [I-D.ietf-alto-problem-statement] is to provide guidance to the
   applications, which have to select one or several hosts from a set of
   candidates able to provide the desired resource.

   Participants have proposed a number of solutions to the ALTO WG,
   which have been merged to produce [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol].  The goal
   of the mechanisms specified in this document is to extend the
   existing solution to improve the performance of the protocol and
   better satisfy the privacy requirements.  These mechanisms introduce
   a way to directly transfer the guidance or costs using Network
   Location identifiers/PIDs, called CPIDs.  The proposed solution
   inherits the existing solution's architecture, messages, and other
   mechanisms.  It can be used as an independent solution or function
   together with other functions in the existing solution to provide
   guidance for different client and balance the workload on the server.
   It can also reduce the risk regarding to the privacy issue,
   especially for P2P applications.  This document is a work in progress
   and will be updated in the future.


2.  Terminology and Concepts

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document also reuses the concepts defined in
   [I-D.ietf-alto-problem-statement] and [I-D.ietf-alto-reqs].


3.  Overview

   The protocol proposed in this draft can be considered as an extension
   of or a complementary to the merged ALTO protocol, and inherits
   existing architecture from the draft [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol].

                             ALTO Architecture


   Figure 1 (extracted from [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol]) shows the overall
   system architecture of the ALTO protocol.  This draft is also
   consistent with this architecture.  In this architecture, an ALTO
   Client uses ALTO Service Discovery to identify an appropriate ALTO
   Server; an ALTO Server prepares ALTO Information; and the ALTO Client
   requests available ALTO Information from the ALTO Server using the
   ALTO Protocol.

   In our proposed ALTO protocol, the ALTO guidance messages are
   simplified to cost-peer-identifiers (CPID) request/response only.
   ALTO Information from the ALTO Server is abstracted and dispersed to
   each potential peer.  When ALTO clients get the CPIDs, they also

Internet-Draft        CPID ALTO Protocol Extension             July 2010


   obtain the ALTO guidance regarding those peers at the same time.  As
   a result, requests and server workload, as well as privacy risks, are
   significantly reduced.

3.1.  CPID Defined

3.1.1.  What is a CPID?

   In [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol], the Network Map and the Cost Map are two
   separate data objects, even though the Cost Map is based on and
   reflects the realtionship between the elements of the Network Map. If
   clients want to get ALTO guidance, they obtain both the the PIDs of
   candidate peers in the Network Map, as well as path ratings using the
   obtained PIDs.  In our proposed extension, the Network Map and the
   Cost Map are combined into one map.  The elements in this map act as
   new type of PID.  As with the original PID in the network map, this
   new PID type, which we called CPID, provides an implicit way to
   specify a network aggregation.  CPIDs reflect the costs/weights
   between peers indirectly.  Assuming that CPID1 is the CPID of peer1,
   and CPID2 is the CPID of peer2, then cost between these two peers
   could be represented as the following equation.

   COST(peer1, peer2) = FUNC(CPID1, CPID2)

   Here, the cost FUNC can be a simple multiplication, a cross-
   production or any formula that the ISP [QUESTION:should this be ISP,
   or ALTO server?] defines.  After getting CPIDs of two peers, through
   this simple function ALTO clients can easily obtain the cost between
   these two peers for use as a path rating.

   Both cost type and cost mode can use existing mechanisms.  The cost
   Type attribute indicates what the cost represents.  For example, an
   ALTO Server could define costs representing air-miles, hop-counts, or
   generic routing costs.  The Mode attribute indicates how costs should
   be interpreted.  For example, the cost can be interpreted as
   numerical values or ordinal rankings.  Note that the type of CPID is
   independent of cost type and cost mode.  The cost between two peers
   is calculated by the cost function with the two CPIDs as inputs,
   whatever the type of CPID is.

   A CPID could be a simple binary code, a coordinates, or any other
   types defined freely.  The type is decided by the method of CPID
   construction.  The CPID construction method also decides the cost
   FUNC.  The details of the construction method are not inside the
   scope of this draft.  ISP may internally construct CPID using any
   method it chooses.  A single CPID to a peer ostensibly is only an
   identifier no matter the type it chooses.  When the CPIDs of the
   source peer and destination peers have been obtained, ALTO client

Internet-Draft        CPID ALTO Protocol Extension             July 2010


   could calculate the costs for better peer selection.


4.  Protocol Overview

   The first step for a P2P application to use ALTO guidance is to
   discover one or more corresponding ALTO servers.  ALTO Services and
   Servers are discovered through some certain mechanisms such as DNS,
   DHCP [I-D.song-alto-server-discovery].  After finding the correct
   ALTO server, ALTO client needs to know what the ALTO server could
   provide to assist its peer selection.  By negotiation, ALTO Client
   will get a configuration file from a particular ALTO Server.  The
   configuration file includes, for example, details about the type of
   CPID, cost FUNC, and cost metrics supported by the ALTO Server.
   Then, ALTO Client starts ALTO guidance requesting.  In this protocol,
   the guidance for peer selection is derived through CPID of Endpoints.
   ALTO Client sends a Query to ALTO server for requesting CPID(s) of
   one or a set of Host Location Attributes (HLAs, [1]) of peers.  ALTO
   Server considers the request and should reply with the corresponding
   CPID(s).  When a P2P tracker acts as an ALTO client, it could
   retrieve the CPID for a peer when it joins and stores it locally for
   later use.  If a P2P client requests for candidate source providers,
   P2P tracker will gather destination candidates and get the CPIDs of
   source and destination candidates locally.  Then, P2P tracker
   calculates the costs of source and destination pairs by using cost
   FUNC with their CPIDs as the inputs.  Finally, P2P tracker could
   determine the candidates to select according to the sorted costs.
   When a P2P client acts as an ALTO client, it could retrieve the CPID
   for itself and stores it locally for later use.  P2P Applications
   could adopt CPID as an attribute of the application.  The CPID could
   take part in the process of peer selection.  When P2P client does
   resource discovery, it also gathers their CPIDs at the same time,
   e.g. the DHT will tell the requester the CPIDs of destination peers.
   Then P2P client could calculate and compare the costs, and determine
   the candidates to select finally.  Note that the CPID should have a
   part to distinguish the ISP it belongs to.  For the CPIDs in the same
   ISP, P2P client/trackers could directly calculate the cost of the
   path between the source peer and the destination peer.  If the
   candidate peers in the same ISP are not enough, P2P client/tracker
   could use the ways in other drafts [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol] for
   guidance requesting, or directly use an ISP priority map for crossed
   ISP peer selection.

4.1.  Messages

Internet-Draft        CPID ALTO Protocol Extension             July 2010


4.1.1.  Capabilities Query

   For seeking guidance in Resource Provider selection, an ALTO Client
   sends a Capability query to one or more ALTO Servers to discover
   which rating criteria are supported and at which accuracy level.
   Through some certain mechanisms such as DNS, DHCP
   [I-D.song-alto-server-discovery], ALTO Services and Servers could be
   discovered.

   The capability query and response could be the same as other ALTO
   protocols.  Through the queries and responses between servers and
   clients, ALTO server and client could negotiate about the PID type
   and cost FUNC for generating the cost from CPIDs, and may also about
   which rating criteria and which accuracy level for the ALTO server to
   adopt to provide CPID to ALTO client.

4.1.2.  Guidance

   In this solution, the guidance for peer selection is through CPID of
   Endpoints.  In draft [6], the Endpoint Property Lookup query allows
   an ALTO Client to query for the properties of Endpoints known to the
   ALTO Server.  CPID is also a type of PID, so we can reuse the
   Endpoint Property Lookup query to retrieve the CPID of each endpoint.

   An ALTO Client sends an Endpoint Property Lookup query to an ALTO
   Server to request the guidance for peer selection.  When a P2P
   tracker acts as an ALTO client, the query may include one or a set of
   HLAs of peers.  This HLA represents new joint peer or the peer whose
   CPID need to be update.  When a P2P client acts as an ALTO client,
   the query may include HLA itself or set null only.

   The response from ALTO server should provide a CPID for each peer in
   the associated query.  ALTO Client will store the CPID(s) locally for
   later use, and may also maintains a back-end database that updates at
   pre-determined intervals or sudden changes.

   A Server may contain the used response cost FUNC in order to further
   assist the client to generate the cost for peer selection.  It also
   could be retrieved in other ways.  For example, the returned
   documents including cost FUNC can be downloaded by ALTO Clients or
   provisioned into devices.

5.1.  ALTO Client Embedded in P2P Tracker

   A P2P tracker could handle a large number of clients.  When a P2P
   tracker acts as an ALTO client to enable more network-efficient
   traffic patterns and improve application performance, the P2P tracker
   should request the ALTO information (CPIDs) for peers.

   Figure 2 ALTO Client Embedded in P2P Tracker

   Figure 2 shows an example that a P2P tracker as an ALTO Client uses
   ALTO information for peer selection.  The example process is shown as
   follows:

   1.  When A P2P Client joins the swarm or need to be update, the P2P
   Tracker requests and obtains its CPID and then stores it locally.
   The P2P Tracker could collect new joint peers or the peers need to be
   updated together for CPID requesting.

   2.  A P2P Client requests a peer list from the P2P Tracker.

   3.  The P2P Tracker gathers destination candidates and gets the CPIDs
   of source and destination candidates locally.  In case of sufficient
   candidate peers in the same ISP, the P2P Tracker then runs the COST-
   CALCULATE function to rank the candidate peers using their CPID.  If
   not, P2P tracker could use the ways in other drafts
   [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol] for guidance requesting, or directly use an
   ISP priority map for crossed ISP peer selection.

   4.  The P2P Tracker returns the selected peer list to P2P client.

   5.  The P2P Client connects to the selected peers.

5.2.  ALTO Client Embedded in P2P Client

   P2P clients may also utilize ALTO information themselves for better
   peer selection.  When a P2P Client works as an ALTO client, it
   typically queries only the ALTO Server that belongs to its own ISP
   for its own CPID.  P2P Applications could adopt CPID as an attribute
   of the application.  This CPID could take part in the process of peer
   selection, such as resource discovery.  When P2P client discovers the
   candidate peers, it also gathers their CPIDs at the same time.

   Figure 3: ALTO Client Embedded in P2P Client

   Figure 3 shows an example use the case that a P2P client as an ALTO
   Client uses ALTO information for peer selection.  The example process
   is shown as follows:

   1.  The P2P Client requests and gets it own CPID from its ALTO Server
   and then stores it locally

   2.  The P2P Client discovers peers together with their CPIDs from
   sources such as Peer Exchange (PEX) from other P2P Clients,
   Distributed Hash Tables (DHT), and P2P Trackers.

   3.  In case of sufficient candidate peers in the same ISP, the P2P
   client then runs the COST-CALCULATE function to rank the candidate
   peers using their CPID and determines the peers to be select
   according to the rank.  If not, P2P client could use the ways in
   other drafts [I-D.ietf-alto-protocol] for guidance requesting, or
   directly use an ISP priority map for crossed ISP peer selection.

   4.  The P2P Client connects to the selected peers.

6.  Security Considerations

   An ALTO Server may optionally use authentication and encryption to
   protect ALTO information for preventing the information being
   disclosed on the path.  This will be further discussed in other
   documents.


7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA may need to assign numbers to distinguish different ISPs with
   this solution.

Appendix A.  Examples

   To reflect the relationships of peer pairs exactly, we can use an
   n-dim vector to represent the CPID.  The basic idea is that each node
   (can be a peer or an aggregated peer group) in an n-dimension
   hyperplane constructed by n nodes can be represented by an
   n-dimension coordinate at least.  We already have all the distance/
   cost values between pair of nodes.  Thus, we can formulae an n*n
   dimension weight matrix W, where ELEMENTij means the weight value
   from node i to node j.  Presumably, ELEMENTij in the weight matrix W
   can be considered as the inner product of node i and node j.  Thus,
   we can find an n-dimension vector X to represent each node through
   matrix decomposition W= C*C^T.

   Assuming that we have n nodes needed to be assigned CPID and we have
   obtained the weights of all node pairs, we can formulate a weight
   matrix W as shown in Figure 4.  The row suffix i and the column
   suffix j of each element Wij represent the source and destination of
   a path with the weight value or priority value Wij. The priority
   value can be an ordinary number from 1 to n or other weighted number
   according to the sorting of weight value for the same source node i.
   The diagonal elements which mean the source node and the destination
   node are the same have the highest weight or priority, if the highest
   weight or priority means the nearest or lowest cost.

   There are many ways to obtain a matrix C satisfying W= C*C^T. The
   simplest way is Cholesky decomposition.  Cholesky decomposition is a
   decomposition of a symmetric, positive-definite matrix into a lower
   triangular matrix and the transpose of the lower triangular matrix.
   The necessary condition for applying Cholesky decomposition is that
   the matrix W is symmetric and positive definite.  Assuming that the
   weights of two directions between two nodes are the same and the
   weight in same node is high enough, these conditions can be
   satisfied.  Then we can easily apply Cholesky decomposition on W, as
   shown in Equation. 1.  The i-th row of matrix C is the coordinates of
   node i as the CPID.

   Equation. 1

   When selecting peers in the same ISP for peer A, what we need to do
   is only calculating the inner products of CPIDs of peer A and other
   peers.  And then sort the inner products and choose peers with high
   inner product values.

   However, a problem of these above methods is the assumption that the
   weights from node i to j and from j to i should be same.  Although it
   is the true in most cases, we still want to control or distinguish
   the weight Wij and Wji .  The basic idea is to separate the
   coordinates of node to two parts.  For node i, part of coordinate is
   the identifier Csoui as source, and the other is the identifier Cdesi
   as destination.  Therefore, Wij = Csoui * Cdesj^T is different from
   Wji = Csouj * Cdesi^T .  Similarly, what we want here is not a
   coordinate matrix C but a source coordinate matrix Csou and a
   destination matrix Cdes.  And the coordinate of node i is the
   combination of the i-th row of Csou and the i-th row of Cdes .  There

   are lots of matrix decomposition methods for finding Csou and Cdes
   satisfying W= Csou * Cdes^T such as LU, QR, Singular value
   decomposition (SVD).  LU decomposition is a matrix decomposition
   which writes a matrix as the product of a lower triangular matrix and
   an upper triangular matrix.  Cholesky decomposition is a special case
   of the symmetric LU decomposition, with L = U^T. Here we adopt SVD
   which is more efficiency and easier to extend.  SVD is an important
   factorization of a rectangular real or complex matrix, with several
   applications in signal processing and statistics.  Through applying
   SVD on W, we could obtain an equation W=U*S*V^T , where U is an
   n-by-n unitary matrix, S is an n-by-n diagonal matrix with
   nonnegative real numbers on the diagonal, and V^T , an n-by-n unitary
   matrix, denotes the conjugate transpose of V,.  Usually the diagonal
   entries Si,i are ordered in non-increasing fashion.  In this case,
   the diagonal matrix S is uniquely determined by W (though the
   matrices U and V are not).  The diagonal entries of S are known as
   the singular values of W. Through matrix transformation (choose
   freely) we could get the Csou and Cdes as shown in Equation. 2.

   This multi-dimension CPID can be also performed in a hierarchical
   construction manner.  We obtain the Csou and Cdes matrixes from
   weight or priority matrix of each level, and combine the ID of each
   level as the final representation.  Noticed that if we want calculate
   the inner product of combined IDs directly, the weights or priorities
   in the high level should be larger enough than the low level to
   distinct different levels.

   When peer A wants to select peers, it can send request only using the
   source part of CPID.  The P2P tracker calculates the inner products
   of the source part of peer A's CPID with the destination part of
   CPIDs of other candidate peers in the same ISP.  And then sort the
   inner products and choose the peers with high inner product values.
   It is an easy way to keep the secrecy.

   Representing CPID with large dimensional data may be inconvenient and
   lead to low efficiency in message transmission and priority
   calculation, since the number of nodes needed to be assigned to an
   CPID is too big.  At the same time, there is much redundant
   information in the weight matrix or n-dimension coordinates, since
   the network design usually follows some strategies and rules to some
   extent.  Moreover, the consistency between different groups of nodes
   needs to be guaranteed.  Therefore, a more efficient peer
   representation can be found.  A common way is to reduce the
   dimensionality to an appropriate number.  There are several methods
   for dimension reduction, including principal components analysis
   (PCA), projection pursuit, principal curves, self-organizing maps, as
   well as provides neural network implementations of some of the
   reviewed statistical models.  We can use PCA for the dimension
   reduction because PCA allows each node's coordinate values to be
   represented by a set of uncorrelated low dimensional parameters and
   can minimize reconstruction error optimally under the L2 norm.  In
   our case, we can apply the PCA to process the weight matrix
   decomposition directly, which can minimize the reconstruction error
   of weight matrix than applying PCA to coordinate matrix.  By choosing
   the first r (r <<n) principal components (PCs) from PCA transform, we
   can reduce the size of the matrix significantly without losing much
   information of the topology.

   Equation. 5

   As a result, an r-dimension representation is obtained for each node
   and the coordinates set of all nodes can be described using n*r
   matrixes Cnew-sou and Cnew-des to describe.  Applying this
   r-dimension representation as CPID for peer selection is the same as
   n-dimension CPID.

   The number of r could be decided in different ways.  In our
   application, we can adopt a simple method using projection error.  It
   is equipped with the Euclidean norm.  Actually, projecting the
   vectors on the optimal hyperplane is equivalent to discarding all
   singular values except the largest r, so the projection error can be
   written in Equation. 6.

    e =  SUM{square(||Xi-Xi'||)},   i=1 to n
      =  SUM{square(||sj||)},       j=r+1 to n

   Equation. 6

          SUM{square(||sj||)},   j=1 to r
    Er = ----------------------------------
          SUM{square(||sj||)},   j=1 to n

   Equation. 7

   Then the ratio Er (Equation. 7) indicates how much information is
   retained by projecting the vectors on the optimal r-dimensional
   hyperplane.  In our test, the average of Er = 90 % of weight
   relationships of network can be achieved only using 8 PCs, by which
   the reconstructed weight shows very small difference from the
   original weight.
