1.  Introduction

   Today's challenges of evolving threats and improved analytics to
   address such threats highlight a need to automate the securing of
   both information and the systems that store, process and transmit the
   information.  SACM's charter focuses on addressing some of these
   challenges in a narrower scope by bounding the task to address use
   cases that pertain to the posture assessment of endpoints.

   This document focuses on describing the requirements for facilitating
   the exchange of posture assessment information, in particular, for
   the use cases as exemplified in [I-D.ietf-sacm-use-cases].

2.  Terminology

   Currently defined in [I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology].

3.  Requirements

   This document defines requirements based on the SACM WG's use cases
   defined in [I-D.ietf-sacm-use-cases].  This section describes the
   requirements used by the SACM WG to assess and compare candidate
   information models and protocols to suit the architecture.  These
   requirements express characteristics or features that a candidate
   protocol or data model must be capable of offering so as to ensure
   security and interoperability.

3.1.  Reference Architecture Model

   Until a richer architecture is agreed upon, the requirements are
   predicated on the following model:

                        Simple Architectural Model

   The Architectural Model shown above demonstrates:

   o  Asset: is the endpoint of interest that is posture validated.

   o  Evaluator: is the service that evaluates the posture assessment
      and stores the posture result into a repository.

   o  Repository: is the storage component bound to the Evaluator that
      contains the posture assessment information.

   o  Posture Assessment Repository: is another type of repository (or a
      Collector) that holds posture assessment information.  While not
      bound to the Evaluator, it is another source of posture assessment
      information (e.g. a data aggregation point aggregating posture
      assessment with other attributes) that can provide information to
      serve SACM use cases.

   o  Assessment Consumer: is the service that requires the posture
      assessments information of one or more assets.

   Using this architectural reference model, the interfaces, data models
   and transports used to affect the posture assessment, e.g. A in the
   figure above have already been defined by different mechanisms, for
   example, an IETF defined one through NEA.  As the focus of SACM is
   the information exchange to obtain the posture assessment
   information, it can be achieved through the interfaces shown as B.
   That is, it is not clear that there is a requirement for the
   Assessment Consumer to tap directly into the Repository.  Similarly,

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title              February 2014


   it is not clear that SACM is chartered to define the interfaces and
   data model for how an Evaluator stores and transports the assessment
   results to the Repository.  Thus, the focus of the requirements will
   revolve around the data models, protocols and transports for B, the
   communication of posture assessment from an Evaluator to an
   Assessment Consumer.

3.2.  General SACM requirements

   The use cases defined in [I-D.ietf-sacm-use-cases] apply to many
   deployment scenarios.  To ensure interoperability, scalability and
   flexibility in any of these deployments, the following requirements
   are defined for all use cases:

   G-001  The data models, protocols and transports defined by the SACM
    WG must be extensible to allow support for non-standard and future
    extensions.

   G-002  The data models, protocols and transports must be specified
    with enough details and state machine to ensure interoperability.

   G-003  SACM must support a broad set of deployment scenarios.  As
    such, it is possible that the size or posture assessment information
    can vary from a single assessment that is small in (record or
    datagram) size to a very large datagram or a very large set of
    assessments and must be addressed by the SACM specifications
    defined.  Thus, the data models, protocols and transports must be
    scalable.

   G-004  Considerations for the lightweight implementations of data
    models and transports is required.  Use cases, especially in the
    vulnerability assessment and threat defense applications require
    time criticality in both obtaining the information as well as
    consuming (e.g. parsing) the data.  The agility requirement is to
    ensure that the data model, protocols, transports and its
    implementations are suitable to fit in different deployment models
    and scenarios.

   G-005  Different transports must be supported to address different
    deployment and time constraints.  Supporting layer 2, layer 3 and
    layer 7 transports are to be considered.

   G-006  For interoperability and scope boundary, an explicit set of
    data attributes as mandatory to implement should be defined.  While
    the SACM charter defines the focus to be on posture assessment,
    attributes corresponding to Posture Assessment should be described.

   G-007  To address security and privacy considerations, the data
    model, protocols and transport must consider authorization based on
    roles to only allow authorized requestors and publishers to access
    the information being requested or published.

3.3.  Requirements based on Use Cases

   This section describes the requirements that may apply to information
   models, data models, protocols or transports as identified by the use
   cases in [I-D.ietf-sacm-use-cases] and referenced by the section
   numbers from that draft.

   REQ-001  Use Cases in the whole of Section 2 describe the need for an
    Attribute Dictionary.  With SACM's scope focused on Posture
    Assessment, the attribute collection and aggregation must have a
    well understood set of attributes inclusive of their meaning or
    usage intent.

   REQ-002  Use Case 2.1.1 describes the need for an Information Model
    to drive content definition.  As the SACM WG will endeavor to reuse
    already existing standards which may have their own data models
    defined by instantiating an information model, the data models can
    be mapped to SACM's information model.  See [RFC3444] for a
    description and distinctions between an information and data model.

   REQ-003  Use Case 2.1.1 describes the need to instantiate a data
    model that can map to the SACM protocols for posture content
    operations such as publication, query, change detection and
    asynchronous notifications.

   REQ-004  Use Case 2.1.2 describes the need to discover endpoints and
    their composition.

   REQ-005  Use Case 2.1.2 describes the need for the data model to
    support a query operation based on a set of attributes to facilitate
    collection of information such as posture assessment, inventory (of
    endpoints or endpoint components) and configuration checklist.

   REQ-006  Use Case 2.1.3 describes the need for the data model to
    support the means for the information to be collected through a
    query mechanism.

   REQ-007  Use Cases 2.1.4 and 2.1.5 describe the need for the data
    model to support the means for the information to be published
    asynchronously.  Similarly, the data model must support the means
    for a requestor to obtain updates or change modifications
    asynchronously.

   REQ-008  Use Cases 2.1.4 and 2.1.5 describes the need for the data
    model to support scalability.  For example, the query operation may
    result in a very large set of attributes as well as a large set of
    targets.

   Montville for reviewing and contributing to this draft.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document defines the requirements for the SACM WG.  As such, it
   is expected that several data models, protocols and transports may be
   defined or reused from already existing standards.  This section will
   highlight security considerations that may apply to SACM based on the
   architecture and standards applied in SACM.
