1. Introduction

   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) [4] defines a syntax for
   describing multimedia sessions, including audio, video, and text.
   SDP is used by several other Internet protocols, including the
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [5] and the Real Time Streaming
   Protocol (RTSP) [6].  When used by SIP, SDP is exchanged by each
   participant using an offer/answer model [8].

   Although SDP is meant to support a variety of different sessions, its
   primary usage was for sessions carried using the Real Time Transport
   Protocol (RTP) [7].  RTP is carried over UDP.  As a result of this,
   although TCP-based sessions were discussed in RFC 2327, they were not
   the focus.

   Recent applications of SDP for describing TCP-based sessions led to
   the discovery of some gaps in SDP.  To remedy those gaps, a set of
   extensions to SDP for supporting connection oriented media were
   developed, generally referred to as the  comedia [2] extension.
   These attributes help resolve which participant in a two-party
   session will open a connection, when the connection is to be closed,
   and when each participant can cease listening on its advertised
   ports.

   Since the development of the comedia extension, another application
   has materialized.  This application is instant messaging sessions
   [1].  It has been proposed that IM sessions should be transported
   using a relatively simple protocol called "CPIM over TCP" [3].  Since
   CPIM over TCP runs over TCP (big surprise), it can make use of
   comedia.  However, it was discovered that comedia was unable to meet
   several of the needs for IM sessions.

   This document first briefly summarizes the comedia extension.  Then,
   it outlines the problems identified with comedia.  Lastly, it
   proposes new behavior and attributes to fix these problems.

2. Overview of Comedia

   The comedia specification is relatively simple.  The main issue with
   TCP-based sessions is who will open the connection.  Ideally, a
   session between a pair of participants will use a single TCP
   connection to exchange data in both directions.  Since a connection
   is opened only by one participant, there must be a way to determine
   who will open it.  This determination is made through the a=direction
   attribute defined in the specification.  It can contain three values
   - active, passive, or both.  Active means that the participant would
   like to initiate the connection.  Passive means that it would like to
   receive the connection.  Both means that it can do either.  If one
   participant sends an SDP with an active attribute, the other sends an
   SDP with the passive attribute, and the active side opens to the
   passive side.  If both sides indicate a direction of "both", they
   both open connections, and if both succeed, an attempt is made to use
   just one of them, allowing the other to be closed after timeout.

   Comedia provides rules for connection lifetime management.  A client
   has to listen on an advertised port until a connection has been
   established on it.  The connection is kept open for the lifetime of
   the session.  Comedia also specifies that a connection closure
   requires a new exchange of SDP to re-open the connection, if it still
   needs to be used.

   Comedia also allows the active side of the connection to indicate the
   source IP/port it will use when opening the connection.  The
   specification describes two uses.  One is in firewalls, which can
   allocate a "pinhole" for this session, using a full five-tuple,
   rather than just a cone (using the destination information only) when
   the source is unknown.  The second use is allowing the passive side
   to disambiguate which client is connecting, in the case of port
   reuse.  This has clear problems with NAT, which are mentioned in the
   spec.

3. Problems with Comedia

   We have identified several key problems with the specification as
   currently written.  Most of them manifest themselves when considering
   usage of comedia on servers that support multiple sessions (such as
   gateways to the PSTN), or on intermediaries.

3.1 Port Multiplicity on Servers

   The first problem with comedia is, for all intents and purposes, a
   user agent needs to allocate a single port for every single session
   that it handles.  This constraint is not an issue for single user
   devices, like PCs or wireless phones, but it is a serious constraint
   for servers handling multiple sessions.  Examples of such servers
   include gateways to other networks, such as an SMS gateway, and
   application servers, such as an IM recording application.

   To its credit, comedia does say that a UA can reuse a port for
   multiple sessions.  However, in order to do this, a server must be
   able to correlate a connection with the session that is using it.
   Consider an SMS gateway that receives SIP INVITE requests for IM
   sessions.  In the SDP answer it generates, it always places the same
   IP address and port information.  Each client that connects to it
   opens a new TCP connection to the server.  However, the gateway needs
   to know which session each connection is associated with.  When it
   receives an SMS from the PSTN, it will look up the intended
   recipient, and figure out which SIP dialog to send the message on.
   From that, it needs to determine which connection to use.  How is
   such a matching done?

   Comedia suggests that it is accomplished using the source IP address
   and port of the TCP connection request.  When the client sends its
   SDP offer to the gateway, it can include the source IP and port it
   intends to use.  The gateway could match this up with the source
   address of the TCP SYN packets.  However, this mechanism completely
   fails in the presence of NAT.  Since the gateway doesn't know whether
   the client is connecting through NAT, it has no way to know whether
   it can trust the source address information.  This limits connection
   sharing to very specific network deployments where all participants
   are aware that there are no NATs.  Unfortunately, that covers very
   few cases.

   So, since port sharing is basically impossible for all but the most
   specific cases, the server must allocate a single port for each
   incoming session, so that the port number itself is used to correlate
   each connection to the session.  Besides having known scaling
   problems, this makes firewall policy configuration complicated, since
   a single well-known port cannot be used by the server.

3.2 No Connection Reuse

   A more serious problem than the one outlined in Section 3.1 is that
   there is no possibility of connection reuse between elements which
   share multiple sessions.  This occurs between servers (such as a pair
   of SMS gateways), and also between intermediaries.

                                Figure 1

   Consider the network of Figure 1.  In this network, there are two
   enterprises, foo and bar.  These enterprises are both connected to
   the public Internet, and would like to "federate".  This means that
   they would like to communicate with each other through a secure
   connection between the enterprises.  To do that, both enterprises
   deploy a SIP proxy on the border of their network.  These proxies, in
   addition to processing SIP traffic, also act as an intermediary for
   instant messaging sessions.  A single TLS connection is used in each

Internet-Draft              Comedia Changes                December 2002


   direction, terminating on port 5061, between the proxies to handle
   the SIP traffic.  Furthermore, it is desired that a single TLS
   connection is used between the enterprises (or two, one in each
   direction), terminating on a well known port.  This is important for
   purposes of congestion control, scale, and security.  The enterprises
   would like to configure their firewalls to allow outbound connections
   to the proxy in the peer network, but only to the specific port used
   for the instant messaging traffic.  Indeed, RFC 2779 [9] explicitly
   identifies this as a requirement.

   This configuration is not practical with comedia.  The reason is that
   the comedia specification tightly binds the lifetime of the
   connection and the lifetime of the sessions.  Each proxy would need
   to reference count the number of sessions using the connection.  Only
   when the number of sessions using the connection goes to zero could
   the proxies close the connection.  Worse, if the connection closed
   due to some kind of network outage, the only way to re-establish
   would be for the proxies to generate re-INVITEs.  This would require
   full b2bua functionality, rather than just a proxy.

   Furthermore, as describe in Section 3.1, internally, each proxy would
   need to allocate a single port for each client that connects to it.
   This has serious scale problems.

3.3 Security Considerations

   Comedia introduces some important security considerations which are
   not discussed in the current specification.

   Consider an attacker who wishes to hijack a call, so that Alice
   thinks she is calling Bob, but instead communicates with the
   attacker, Carol.  Alice sends a SIP INVITE request with SDP that
   contains some comedia sessions.  Alice indicates a direction
   attribute of "both".  Carol is capable of eavesdropping, but not
   modifying, the contents of the messages.  Carol observes the IP
   address and port listed by Alice.  Similarly, Bob places his IP
   address and port in the answer, which is also observed by Carol.
   Carol then opens two TCP connections - one to the address indicated
   by Alice, and one to the address indicated by Bob.  Both of these
   succeed, and are established before the connections initiated by
   Alice and Bob themselves.  Carol immediately uses the connections she
   just established, forcing Alice and Bob to use that connection
   instead of the one each just established to the other.  As a result,
   Carol can now communicate bidirectionally with Alice and with Bob,
   even though Alice and Bob think they are talking to each other.

   This attack doesn't occur with normal SDP/RTP usage.  Hijacking a
   media stream in that case requires an attacker to act as a

Internet-Draft              Comedia Changes                December 2002


   man-in-the-middle (MITM), modifying the IP address and port
   information.  Here, the attacker need only eavesdrop.  Since
   eavesdropping is much simpler to do than acting as a MITM, comedia
   significantly increases the risk of this attack.

   Sadly, this attack is difficult to prevent.  Even if SIP S/MIME and
   the sips method are used, the attack can still take place.  As long
   as the attacker can guess the IP address and port that either Alice
   or Bob will use, once the attacker just observes a communication
   attempt, they can launch the attack against the range of ports which
   are likely to be used.  The only way to prevent this attack is with
   secure media streams, which are difficult to deploy.

   Furthermore, the current security considerations described by comedia
   cannot be implemented.  The specification indicates that firewalls
   should make sure that the SDP comes from a trusted source before
   establishing the pinholes implied by the SDP.  However, firewalls are
   intermediaries on the signaling paths.  As such, they cannot
   participate in authentication mechanisms such as digest and S/MIME.
   There is, therefore, no way to reliably authenticate the sender of
   the SDP.  Furthermore, the source address present in the SDP may not
   be correct, because the SDP has passed through a NAT which did not
   implement an ALG function for this SDP parameter.

4. Proposed Changes to Comedia

   We propose several changes to the operation of comedia in order to
   address these shortcomings.  Generally speaking, these changes are
   aimed at two specific goals.  The first is to decouple the connection
   lifetimes and session lifetimes.  The second is to provide a way to
   bind connections to sessions which does not require IP addressing
   information.

4.1 The Endpoint ID

   The first part of this proposal is the usage of an endpoint
   identifier to bind connections to sessions.  Each endpoint that
   participates in a comedia session would choose a globally unique,
   cryptographically random ID which serves as an endpoint identifier.
   Single user endpoints can choose a different identifier for each
   session.  Intermediaries would need to use more long-lived
   identifiers.

   When a client generates an offer, it includes its endpoint identifier
   in the SDP, as an attribute associated with the comedia session.  The
   answerer responds with its own endpoint ID.  Both sides proceed to
   open connections, as described in the comedia specification.  Once
   the connection is established, each side sends its own endpoint ID to
   the other side.  The active side always sends their ID first.

                                Figure 2

   The basic flow for connection establishment is shown in Figure 2.
   The offerer sends a SIP INVITE request with SDP (1).  This SDP offer
   indicates a single media session (instant messaging), using comedia.
   The offerer is listening on IP address 1.2.3.4 port 7766.  The
   offerer also provides an endpoint ID, 3344.  The answerer indicates
   its IP address and port (5.6.7.8:8899) and its endpoint ID, 1122.
   The offerer opens a TCP connection to the answerer.  Once the
   connection is established, the first bytes sent by the offerer are
   its endpoint ID (3344), and the first bytes sent by the answerer are
   its endpoint ID (1122).  The endpoint IDs are exchanged only during
   connection establishment, at the very beginning.  Once they are
   exchanged, the data sent over the connection depends on the session
   type.

   The purpose of these endpoint IDs is to provide correlation.  When
   the answerer accepts the TCP connection, and receives the endpoint ID
   3344 over it, it knows that the connection is associated with the SIP
   dialog/offer-answer exchange that just occurred.  A multi-user device
   (such as a gateway) could advertise a single IP address and port,
   accepting connections on it.  As these connections are established,
   each client would send a different endpoint ID, allowing the gateway
   to determine which dialog/session the connection is associated with.

   This mechanism directly addresses the problem outlined in Section
   3.1.  A single TCP port can be used for all media sessions of a
   specific type.  Sessions can be correlated to the connection using an

   ID not directly related to an IP address.  The mechanism therefore
   works through NAT.

   A side-effect of this proposal is to address the security problem
   described in Section 3.3.  Without any additional security measures,
   our proposal is subject to the same attack.  However, preventing it
   is much easier.  If clients choose sufficiently random endpoint IDs,
   so long as the SIP packets cannot be eavesdropped, an attacker cannot
   hijack the session.  Even if the attacker can guess the IP address
   and port, if they cannot send the correct endpoint ID, the connection
   is ignored.  Therefore, protecting the attack only requires
   confidentiality protection of the SIP packets.  This can be done with
   sips, or with S/MIME.  With the current comedia specification,
   neither sips nor S/MIME is sufficient to prevent this attack.

   We would also propose that the source address information be removed
   from the direction attribute.  It is unreliable for connection
   identification, and cannot be validated by a firewall.  We feel that
   the brittleness it introduces far outweighs the potential benefits.

4.2 Decoupled Lifetimes

   We also propose that connection lifetimes be decoupled with session
   lifetimes.  Specifically, we would propose that the active side of
   the connection MAY close it at any time.  The passive side SHOULD let
   the active side close it.  If a participant indicated a direction of
   active or both, and it needs to send data, but no connection is open,
   it can open a new connection to the same IP address and port last
   received from its peer.  No new SIP signaling is required.  The
   endpoint ID exchange occurs as above when the new connection is
   established.  A participant MUST continue to listen on its advertised
   address and port, and MUST be prepared to support multiple
   connections with the same endpoint ID pairs (that is, two connections
   which both resulted in the exchange of the same endpoint IDs).  In
   that case, the connections are treated as equivalent, and either can
   be used.  The active side may close one of them at any time.

   The effect of this proposal is that the TCP connection can be opened
   and closed during the lifetime of a session.  It is not strongly
   bound to the session, and indeed, the same connection could be reused
   for subsequent sessions, as long as the underlying media type (such
   as instant messages) supports a de-multiplex function.  This
   addresses the problem of Section 3.2.  The intermediaries can use a
   single connection for the messaging traffic.  So long as both
   intermediaries indicated a direction of "both", either side could
   close the connection at will, and reopen it when they had data to
   send.  This avoids the need for the intermediaries to be session
   stateful.  They no longer need to reference count sessions on the

   connection.  Should the connection close due to network outage, it
   can be reopened at any time.

   The only difficulty is when there are NATs between the active and
   passive side.  If the passive side closes the connection, and then
   determines that it has data to send, it will not be able to reopen
   the connection.  That is why the passive side of the connection
   SHOULD let the active side close it.  Of course, the corrolary is
   that the active side shouldn't close the connection until it knows
   its done with it.  In the case of a single user device, this means it
   would keep the connection open for the lifetime of the session.

   With this new behavior, the reconnect attribute is no longer needed.
   If one side wishes to force the other to reconnect, it merely drops
   the connection.  When the other side has data to send, it will
   establish a new connection.

5. Conclusion

   We have proposed a number of changes to the semantics and syntax of
   the comedia specification.  We believe these changes will allow
   comedia to be relevant for many useful situations, whereas its
   current specification limits it to corner cases.  We do not believe
   this proposal introduces any increase in complexity.

6. Security Considerations

   Section 3.3 discusses security considerations introduced by
   connection oriented media.  We believe this proposal helps resolve
   the security considerations described there.  If the endpoint ID is
   chosen randomly for each new session, the hijacking attack is
   mitigated using sips or S/MIME.  However, intermediaries will want to
   maintain a more long-lived endpoint ID in order to facilitate
   connection reuse.  Once the endpoint ID becomes long lived, it loses
   its utility in preventing the hijacking attack.  For this reason,
   intermediaries need to be very careful about use of endpoint IDs.  It
   is RECOMMENDED that the same endpoint ID be reused only in
   communicating with a next hop with whom the element has an
   administrative relationship, through which it knows connection reuse
   is desired.  [[OPEN ISSUE: This limits connection reuse to the
   federated model only.  Is there a way to reuse connections in an
   ad-hoc fashion without incurring security risk? Need to think some
   more on that.]]
