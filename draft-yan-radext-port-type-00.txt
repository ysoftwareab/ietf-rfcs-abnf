2.  NAS-Port-Type Value

   This document defines new values for the NAS-Port-Type Attribute.
   This specification concerns the following values:
   
     Value     Description
   -------------------------------------------------
     TBD     Wireless - IEEE 802.16 [802.16]
     TBD     Wireless - IEEE 802.20 [802.20]
     TBD     Wireless - IEEE 802.22 [802.22]

   They are intended to indicate the physical port of the NAS which is 
   authenticating the user accessing using 802.16, 802.20 and 802.22.
   

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign Type values, TBD, for this attribute 
   from the RADIUS Types registry [RADTYP], according to the allocation
   policy given in [RFC3575].
   

4.  Security Considerations

   This specification neither adds to nor detracts from the security of
   the RADIUS protocol.
