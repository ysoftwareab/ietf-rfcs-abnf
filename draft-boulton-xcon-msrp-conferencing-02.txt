Internet-Draft              MSRP Conferencing             September 2005


1.  Introduction

   A Centralized Conference as defined by the XCON working group is both
   signaling and protocol agnostic.  The primary focus of the XCON work
   has been centered on the Session Initiation Protocol for signaling
   and Audio/Video for the media types.  The requirements to support
   conferences of session-based instant messages, private messaging, and
   sidebars are introduced in [6].  This document defines the mechanisms
   and associated framework elements involved when using the Message
   Session Relay Protocol(MSRP) in a Centralized Conference(XCON) in
   support of those requirements.

   [Editors Note: This document is still in early stages of development
   and is intended to invoke discussion.  It is not intended to provide
   exact solutions at his stage, but rather explores a potential
   approach to a solution.]

   This document has been constructed in full compliance with both the
   XCON Framework[2] document and the SIPPING Conference Framework [3]
   document.  The XCON Framework provides the data model and interfaces
   to be used while the SIPPING Framework provides details of the SIP
   signaling protocol operations.  For the purpose of this document,
   MSRP will be discussed in the context of SIP being the carrying
   protocol, as defined in the core MSRP [4] specification.


2.  Conventions and Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1] and indicate requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.


3.  Protocol and Framework Overview

   MSRP is defined as a peer-to-peer protocol that enables a direct
   connection between two compliant endpoints, unless an MSRP relay is
   inserted in the MSRP signaling path.  The MSRP Relay specification
   [5] details the associated functionality with a relay in the
   signaling path.  Centralized conferencing using MSRP can be achieved
   by the Conference Server appearing as an MSRP endpoint for Conference
   Participants, with the Conference server distributing the messages by
   relaying them to each of the conference participants.

   Figure 1 provides an illustration of MSRP clients having a direct,
   1:1 connection to the Conference server.  The MSRP Conference Server

Internet-Draft              MSRP Conferencing             September 2005


   can be roughly categorized as a hybrid MSRP entity that combines both
   MSRP client and MSRP relay functionality.  An MSRP SEND sent to the
   conference will arrive at the conference server and then be
   replicated to all appropriate MSRP sessions.

   Figure 1: Client Connection

   The approach in this document is to minimize the impact no the MSRP
   protocol, while taking full advantage of the functionality provided
   by the XCON and SIPPING Conferencing frameworks.  The solution
   proposal in this document, as described in Section 3.1, meets many of
   the requirements identified in the requirements document for
   Multiparty MSRP [6].  Some of the requirements introduce additional



Boulton & Barnes         Expires March 26, 2006                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft              MSRP Conferencing             September 2005


   concepts that are not yet fully addressed within the context of the
   XCON framework or associated protocol documents, however, they are
   general enough that they should be addressed.  For example, the
   notion of privacy and anonymity of participants is introduced in the
   framework in the context of security, but no discussion of mechanism
   is provided.  [Editor's Note: Further elaboration of how this
   solution proposal meets those requirements is likely required,
   although a simple checklist in the appendix, or inline references to
   those requirements (e.g. ...solution text...(REQ-GEN-10) might
   suffice. ]

   A basic solution for IM chat sessions, also meeting the Multiparty
   MSRP requirements, is documented in [7].  The solution proposed in
   that document requires extensions to the base MSRP protocol.  It uses
   the concept of an "MSRP switch" as the centralized component, whose
   role is very similar to the MSRP Conferencing Server in this
   document.  The solution in [7] doesn't explicitly take advantage of
   the XCON FW data model, as it primarily intends to make use of the
   basic SIP conferencing framework to provide the basic chat
   functionality.  However, that solution approach is compatible with
   the solution components described in this document, with no impact on
   that basic solution proposal.  One of the advantages of applying the
   two solutions in concert would be a reuse of the XCON FW model for
   sidebars and private conferences and manipulation of the conference
   data.  [Editor's Note: Ideally, discussion of this document can be
   used to further the model for sidebars and private conferences within
   the XCON FW document, which is currently very sketchy].

3.1.  Framework operations

   As mentioned in the overview, an MSRP client connecting to a
   Conference server has a 1:1 relationship with the MSRP signaling
   entity, each having a unique MSRP session ID (session ID's are
   contained in MSRP URLs).  When referring to MSRP session ID's the
   document is making reference to the locally (at Conference Server)
   generated Session ID that is inserted into the local Path SDP
   attribute and used for MSRP session signaling identification.  An
   important concept in this proposal is the creation and management of
   MSRP sessions.  It is important that each MSRP session created, as
   identified by the unique session ID, is explicitly tied to an
   associated Conference, represented by the Conference Identifier (as
   defined in the XCON Conference Framework [3]).  This provides the
   relevant association between MSRP and an XCON Conference.  An example
   representation is illustrated by the rows contained in Figure 2

             |         MSRP Session  ID=389hewu         |
             ---------------------------------------------


   Figure 2: Simple Session Association

   The XCON Framework[3] introduces the concept of a Conference User
   Identifier, which is also defined in [TODO].  When a user joins an
   Conference Instance through the signaling protocol, it is allocated
   an appropriate Conference User Identifer either through
   authentication or system allocation.  The Conference User Identifer
   MUST be used in conjunction with the MSRP sessions identifier to
   internally represent a participant in an Conference Instance.
   Figure 2 is then expanded to look like Figure 3.  Again a row in the
   table representing a single entry.


   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   |                   Conference Identifier                        |
   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   |         MSRP Session ID=8asjdhk  |  Conf User ID=839ULjj       |
   |         MSRP Session ID=38iuhds  |  Conf User ID=0283hHu       |
   |         MSRP Session ID=djiowid  |  Conf User ID=ncH37H        |
   |         MSRP Session ID=389hewu  |  Conf User ID=pakdjjH       |
   -------------------------------------------------------------------


   Figure 3: Advanced Session Association

   A more complex session association is necessary due to potential for
   a user to have multiple MSRP sessions in a single conference instance
   e.g. multi-lingual conference support.  The conference representation
   in Figure 3 allows for such functionality when separate SIP dialogs
   represent MSRP sessions.  This process becomes complex when multiple
   SDP MSRP media sessions (m=) are defined in a single payload.  This
   internal representation now needs expanding to enable a Conference
   System to explicitly associate a media session (m=).  This involves
   including the media label, as defined in [8], to maintain the
   internal conference association.  An example is illustrated in
   Figure 4

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   |                        Conference Identifier                            |

   |     MSRP Session ID=8asjdhk  |  Conf User ID=839ULjj  |  Label=iede3    |

   |     MSRP Session ID=Ko03jdk  |  Conf User ID=pakdj7H  |  Label=ehy3h    |
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------


   Figure 4: Advanced Session Association + Media Label

   In Figure 4 Conference User Identifiers '0283hHu' and 'pakdj7H'
   appear twice.  The combination of multiple Conference User
   Identifiers and a unique MSRP session ID enables the conference
   system to clearly identify a specific MSRP instance.  The
   representation also includes the media label, as defined in [8],for
   identification purposes.  This added property, which is extracted
   from the SDP media line, enables clear identification when multi SDP
   media (m=) lines appear in the same SDP payload.

   On issuing an MSRP SEND request to an MSRP media session that is a
   member of an XCON Conference instance, the SEND request will be
   replicated and forwarded, in the relevant context, to all other MSRP
   media sessions that are participants of the Conference Instance.

   An MSRP capable client wishing to join a conference uses standardized
   XCON mechanisms for creating and joining a Conference.  SIP signaling
   mechanisms for creating and joining a conference are defined in
   SIPPING Conference Framework [3] and non signaling specific
   mechanisms are defined in the XCON Framework [2].  A client MUST
   include the media label attribute defined in [8] when including
   multiple MSRP sessions in the same SDP payload.

   Even in the simplest Conference System, where users are allowed to
   enter anonymously, the internal representation described in this
   section should be observed.  In this case the Conference System would
   still internally create a Conference User Identifier for participant
   reference purposes.


4.  Text Sidebar

   The Session Based Messaging Conferencing requirements document [6]
   identifies the requirement (REQ-GEN-12) to set up a sidebar
   conference with one or more participants of the conference.



Boulton & Barnes         Expires March 26, 2006                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft              MSRP Conferencing             September 2005


   The concept of a 'sidebar' in an XCON compliant conference system is
   fully described in section 7.3 of the XCON Framework document [2].
   The creation, manipulation and deletion of sidebars for MSRP based
   sessions has the same principles.

   [Editors note: see current sidebar proposal in the XCON FW relating
   to cloning a conference object with no associated time reference.
   This provides a current sub-conference.]

   Creating a sidebar representation for MSRP would have internal
   ramifications in a Conference System.  It would involve the creation
   of a cloned conference object (see editor's note above) that
   associates the appropriate Conference users.  This would then involve
   a new session being established to convey the Sidebar information.

   [Editors note: Lots more detail to insert.]


5.  Private Message

   [Editors note: This section needs updating to align with updates to
   niemi-simple-chat.]


6.  Security Considerations

   As discussed in the XCON Framework, there are a wide variety of
   potential attacks related to conferencing, due to the natural
   involvement of multiple endpoints and the many, often user-invoked,
   capabilities provided by the conferencing system.  Examples of
   attacks in the context of MSRP conferencing would include the
   following: an endpoint attempting to receive the messages for
   conferences in which it is not authorized to participate, an endpoint
   attempting to disconnect other users, and theft of service, by an
   endpoint, in attempting to create conferences it is not allowed to
   create.

   Since this solution makes use of existing protocols (e.g.  MSRP,
   Conference Control Protocol, SIP), it also re-uses the security
   solutions for those protocols and the associated authorization
   mechanisms.  There are security issues associated with the
   authorization to specifically perform the MSRP conferencing
   capability.  Since, this solution makes use of the XCON framework, it
   makes use of the policy associated with the Conference Object to
   ensure that only authorized entities are able to manipulate the data
   to access the capabilities.  This solution also makes use of the
   privacy and security of the identity of a user in the conference, as
   discussed in the XCON Framework.

   conferencing that aren't covered by based MSRP, MSRP relays or the
   conferencing framework? ]
