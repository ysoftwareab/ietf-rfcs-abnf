Abstract

   The Time Protocol Servers option for IPv6 DHCP (RFC 3315) carries the
   IPv6 addresses of servers that a host should use for the Time
   Protocol (RFC 868).

Internet-Draft   IPv6 DHCP Time Protocol Servers Option   September 2005


   The Time Protocol [1] can be used to obtain the current time from a
   server.  The Time Protocol Servers option defined in this document
   provides an option to provide the IPv6 addresses of Time Protocol
   servers to a host through DHCP [2].

   The option defined in this document is based on the IPv4 DHCP [3]
   Time Server option [4].  This document has no effect on IPv4 DHCP,
   which will continue to use the Time Server option to provide the IPv4
   addresses of RFC 868 Time Protocol servers to clients.


2.  Terminology

   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in RFC2119 [5].

   Throughout this document, unless indicated otherwise for clarity, the
   acronym "DHCP" refers to "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for
   IPv6" [2].


3.  Format of the Time Protocol Servers option

   The Time Protocol Servers option defines a list of Time Protocol
   servers available to the DHCP client.  The IPv6 address of each
   server is included in the option.  The addresses SHOULD be listed in
   order of preference.  The addresses MUST be unicast or anycast
   addresses.

   The Time Protocol Servers option has the following format:

4.  Security Considerations

   A server could use this option to return invalid or incorrect
   addresses or valid addresses of malicious Time Protocol servers to
   the client.

   Authentication of DHCP messages [2] can be used to ensure that the
   contents of this option are not altered in transit between the DHCP
   server and client.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an option code from the IPv6 DHCP options
   registry to OPTION_RFC868_SERVER.
