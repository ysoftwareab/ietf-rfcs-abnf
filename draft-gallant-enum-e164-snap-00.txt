3. What E.164 Means

   E.164 refers to ITU-T Recommendation E.164 ("The international
   public telecommunication numbering plan", May 1997) [2].  Among
   other things, it describes various kinds of "country codes" used for
   international telephone calls (and for many other uses as well).


3.1 E.164 Numbers

   The term "E.164 number" is often refers to a full international
   number for connecting to a telephone via the PSTN (public switched
   telephone network).  Here are two examples of E.164 numbers:

   -  IETF Secretariat (Reston, VA, USA)     +1 703 620 8990
   -  ITU (Geneva, Switzerland)             +41 22 730 51 11

   The "+" sign isn't actually dialed.  It indicates that an
   international prefix is needed, such as "011" from the US, or "00"
   from many countries.  To place such a call, one might first have to
   reach an outside line, then dial the international prefix, and then
   the international number.  The line and the prefix depend on where
   the caller is.  The E.164 number (including country code) identify
   the called party.

   If someone wanted to call the David L. Lawrence Convention Center in
   Pittsburgh from an office or hotel room in one of those many
   countries, the dialed digits would be: 9 - 00 - 1 415 565 6000.  If
   someone else wanted to call the ITU from a Pittsburgh hotel, the
   dialed digits would be: 9 - 011 - 41 22 730 51 11.

3.2 Published E.164-Series Documents

   The E.164 series currently includes two published Supplements and
   one other published Recommendation in addition to E.164 itself.
   They are:

   -  Supplement 1 (03/98) to Rec. E.164, "Alternatives for carrier
      selection and network identification" [3],

   -  Supplement 2 (11/98) to Rec. E.164, "Number Portability" [4], and

   -  Recommendation E.164.1 (03/98), "Criteria and procedures for the
      reservation, assignment and reclamation of E.164 country codes
      and associated Identification Codes (ICs)" [5].

   There are some other E.164-series documents in different stages of
   development or approval, and are identified later in this document.


3.3 Types of E.164 "Country Codes"

   E.164 describes three types of "country codes" that may be used for
   international telephone numbers involving geographic areas, global
   services, and Networks.  Examples of these three kinds of E.164
   country codes are the following:

   -  + 41    is assigned for Switzerland,
   -  +800    is assigned for International Freephone Service, and
   -  +882 nn is reserved/assigned for certain international Networks.

   However, there are several notes.  There is some E.164-specific
   terminology (e.g., "global services" and "Networks") and usage
   contained in E.164.  Also, various other Recommendations or drafts
   may apply to codes, number formats, and usage.  Finally, there are
   some other E.164 codes and uses that these three types do not cover.
   This is a very active area of work.

   E.164 itself does not contain lists of assigned, reserved, or spare
   country codes.  The ITU publishes specific updates in its
   Operational Bulletin [6], issued twice monthly.  The most recent
   complete list of E.164 country codes was published as an Annex to
   the 1 June 2000 issue of the Operational Bulletin [7].


3.4 Work on E.164

   During the 1997-2000 study period, work on E.164 was the
   responsibility of Q1/2 of WP1/2 of SG2 of the ITU-T coordinated with
   the ITU TSB.




Gallant                Expires January 11, 2001               [Page 3]
Internet Draft              E.164 Snapshot               July 12, 2000


   In other words:

   -  Q1/2  is Question 1 (Applications of numbering and addressing
      plans for fixed and mobile services) of SG2,

   -  WP1/2 is Working Party 1 (Numbering, routing, global mobility and
      Services Definition) of SG2,

   -  SG2   is Study Group 2 (Network and service operation),

   -  ITU-T is the Telecommunication Standardization Sector of the ITU,

   -  ITU   is the International Telecommunication Union, and

   -  TSB   is the ITU Telecommunication Standardization Bureau.

   There were other Questions where E.164-related work took place,
   including Q2/2 (Routing and interworking plans for fixed and mobile
   networks) and Q10/2 (Management and development of PSTN-based
   telecommunication services).  This document is a snapshot focused on
   E.164, so other E.164-related work is not discussed here.

   A lot of information about the ITU, including documents, current
   structure, procedures, and more, may be found on the ITU web site
   [8].  However, certain conditions (e.g., registration, subscription,
   or purchase) may apply in some instances.


4. Some E.164 Country Code Assignments/Reservations

   In addition to the E.164 country codes that are used for a "country"
   or an "integrated numbering plan," a number of codes are assigned or
   reserved for different purposes.  Various Recommendations, or draft
   Recommendations under development, may apply.

   Some of those codes are given below.  They show the wide range of
   E.164 usage.  The situation continues to be dynamic.

   Note:  IC (identification code) is the field of digits that comes
   after the CC (country code) in some shared codes.

   -  Codes 0XX are reserved for the present.

   -  Code 388 is assigned as a shared code for a Group of Countries;
      the CC+IC of "+388 3" is assigned to the network ETNS (European
      Telephony Numbering Space).

   -  Code 800 is assigned for the International Freephone Service.

Internet Draft              E.164 Snapshot               July 12, 2000


   -  Codes 808 and 979 are reserved for the International Shared Cost
      Service (ISCS) and the International Premium Rate Service (IPRS),
      respectively.

   -  Code 878 is reserved for the UPT (Universal Personal
      Telecommunication) Service; the set of E.164 numbers beginning
      with "+878 878" is reserved for UPT field trials via IP-based
      technology.

   -  Code 991 is reserved as a shared code for International Trials.

   -  Code 882 is assigned as a shared code for International Networks;
      a number of CC+ICs of the form "+882 nn" are assigned or reserved
      for certain Networks.

   -  Code 881 is assigned as a shared code for Global Mobile Satellite
      Systems (GMSS); several pairs of CC+ICs of the form "+881 n" have
      been assigned or reserved for certain GMSS networks.

   -  Codes 87X are assigned or reserved for a number of uses that
      include historical and/or national matters.  Code 870 is assigned
      for Inmarsat SNAC (single network access code), and codes 871
      through 874 now in use for Ocean Regions will be returned in a
      number of years.  Codes 875 through 877 are reserved for Maritime
      Mobile Service Applications, and code 879 is reserved for
      national non-commercial purposes.

   -  Codes 28X, 83X, and 89X are reserved for E.164 country code
      expansion.


5. Future Decisions, Meetings, and Work

   Work and issues surrounding ITU-T Rec. E.164 will involve decisions
   to be made on current and ongoing work, meetings, and the
   organization, plans, and scope of future work.


5.1 Upcoming Decisions on Recommendations

   At the last meeting of ITU-T SG2 for the 1997-2000 study period
   (Geneva, 7-17 March 2000), Recommendations that were not yet
   approved were grouped into three sets according to their status.

   SG2 identified one Recommendation for SG2 to approve at its next
   meeting and two Recommendations for SG2 to develop further, as well
   as three Recommendations proposed for approval at the WTSA-2000.

Internet Draft              E.164 Snapshot               July 12, 2000


   First, three E.164-related Recommendations were proposed by SG2 for
   approval by the September 27 to October 6 meeting of WTSA-2000 [9]:

   -  Recommendation E.169.2 (New) - Application of Recommendation
      E.164 Numbering Plan for Universal International Premium Rate
      Numbers for the International Premium Rate Service,

   -  Recommendation E.169.3 - Application of Recommendation E.164
      Numbering Plan for Universal International Shared Cost Numbers
      for International Shared Cost Service, and

   -  Recommendation E.195 (New) - ITU-T International Numbering
      Resource Administration.

   Next, one E.164-related Recommendation is proposed by SG2 for
   approval at its next meeting (possibly 23-26 January 2001) [10]:

   -  Draft Recommendation E.164.2 - E.164 numbering resources for
      trials.

   Among the Recommendations listed by SG2 as requiring further
   development, the two E.164-related ones are [11]:

   -  Draft Recommendation E.164.3 - Principles, criteria and
      procedures for the assignment and reclamation of E.164 country
      codes and associated identification codes for groups of
      countries, and

   -  Draft Recommendation E.TIPI - Naming, numbering and addressing
      for interworking between E.164 and IP address-based networks.

   Note again that while Q1/2 (on numbering) was responsible for E.164,
   E.164-related work also took place in other Questions, most notably
   Q2/2 (on routing) and Q10/2 (on PSTN-based services).  As mentioned
   above in this document, that other work is not discussed here.


5.2 Future Meetings

   It is important to clarify that future work depends on the upcoming
   meeting of the WTSA-2000 (World Telecommunication Standardization
   Assembly, Montreal, September 27 to October 6, 2000) [12].

   The WTSA will consider inputs from SG2, the other ITU-T Study
   Groups, and the June 2000 Geneva meeting of TSAG (the
   Telecommunication Standardization Advisory Group).  On the WTSA's
   agenda are proposals on the work program and organization of the
   entire ITU-T.





Gallant                Expires January 11, 2001               [Page 6]
Internet Draft              E.164 Snapshot               July 12, 2000


   Therefore, assumptions about E.164 work going on in a future SG2,
   including a next meeting possibly being in January 2001, should only
   be seen as tentative until they are finalized after the WTSA.

   In addition to the WTSA and the proposed SG2 meetings, there is an
   "interregnum" meeting of Working Party 1/2 (Numbering, Routing,
   Global Mobility, and Service Definition) scheduled for 19-26 October
   2000 in Berlin [13].  The meeting includes Q1/2, Q2/2, and Q10/2.

   To summarize chronologically, the upcoming meetings are:

   -  WTSA   27 Sep to 6 Oct 2000   Montreal
   -  WP1/2  19 to 26 Oct 2000      Berlin      (interregnum meeting)
   -  SG2    23 to 26 Jan 2001(?)   Geneva(?)   (depends on WTSA)


5.3 Future E.164 Work

   Proposals for future SG2 work, including work on E.164, have been
   prepared for the WTSA to consider [14].  Some of the project areas
   proposed for the future Question on numbering include the following:

   -  Requests for numbering resources for new services;
   -  Naming, numbering, and addressing for interworking between E.164
        and IP address-based networks;
   -  E.164 resources for international trials;
   -  Number portability
   -  Criteria for the assignment of codes to groups of countries, for
        the assignment of E.212 (IMSI/MCC/MNC) resources, and for
        allocation of Rec. E.353 international routing addresses;
   -  E.164 country code exhaust;
   -  Activation of, and opening access to, E.164 Numbering Resources;
   -  Mobile numbering issues (as needed); and
   -  Global evolution of naming, numbering, and addressing.

   Other future ITU-T Questions will also have significant work related
   to E.164.  Also, coordination with other fora (i.e., the IETF) will
   be essential.  It will be interesting to see what the final actions
   of WTSA-2000 on ITU-T working methods, the ITU-T work program and
   structure, and other matters will hold in store for future E.164
   work.


6. Security Considerations

      None.
