1.  Introduction

   This document describes the technical details of the interfaces
   provided by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
   (ICANN) to other contracted parties to fulfill reporting
   requirements.  The interface provided by ICANN to Registry Operators
   and Data Escrow Agents to fulfill the requirements of Specifications
   2 and 3 of the gTLD Base Registry Agreement [ICANN-GTLD-RA-20170731]
   are described in this document.  Additionally, interfaces for
   retrieving the IP addresses of the probe nodes used in the SLA
   Monitoring System (SLAM) and interfaces for supporting maintenance
   window objects are described in this document.

   Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 as described in
   [W3C.REC-xml-20081126] and XML Schema notation as described in
   [W3C.REC-xmlschema-1-20041028] and [W3C.REC-xmlschema-2-20041028] are
   used in this specification.

   The provisioning of credentials and authentication methods used in
   the interfaces are outside of this document's scope.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   XML is case sensitive.  Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
   and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
   character case presented to develop a conforming implementation.

1.2.  Date and Time

   Numerous fields indicate "date and time", such as the creation and
   receipt dates for data escrow deposits.  These fields SHALL contain
   timestamps indicating the date and time in UTC as specified in
   [RFC3339], with no offset from the zero meridian.

1.3.  Common elements used in this specification

   Common elements used in this specification are explained in this
   section.

   o  <base-url>: The base URL used in the reporting interfaces examples
      must be replaced with the URL indicated by ICANN.

1.4.  Object Description

   This section describes the base objects supported by this
   specification.

1.4.1.  <iirdea:result> object

   The ICANN interfaces for registries and data escrow agents (IIRDEA)
   <iirdea:result> object is used to provide information on the result
   of a verification process when interacting with the interfaces.  The
   XML Schema for the <iirdea:result> object can be found in
   Section 7.1.

   The <iirdea:result> object contains the following attributes and
   child elements:

   o  A "code" attribute whose value is a four-digit decimal number that
      identifies the result of a process.  Available result code values
      MUST be defined for the corresponding process.

   o  An OPTIONAL "domainCount" attribute indicates the number of domain
      names related to the reported result.

   o  A <msg> element contains a human-readable description of the
      result code.

   o  An OPTIONAL <description> element that includes additional details
      on the result conditions.

   An example of a <iirdea:result> object is presented below:

   <result code="2001">
       <msg>The structure of the report is invalid.</msg>
       <description>
          'XX' could not be parsed as a number (line: 2 column:3)
       </description>
   </result>

1.4.2.  <rdeReport:report> object

   The contents of a data escrow deposit are described using a
   <rdeReport:report> object.  The XML Schema for the <rdeReport:report>
   object can be found in Section 7.2.

   The <rdeReport:report> object contains the following child elements:

   o  An <id> element that contains the identifier assigned to this
      report.  The report identifier MUST be the same as the "id"
      attribute from the <deposit>.  If the data escrow deposit does not
      include a unique identifier, the Data Escrow Agent MUST generate a
      unique identifier to reference the data escrow deposit and use it
      in the <id> element.

   o  A <version> element contains the version of the specification
      used.  This value MUST be 1.

   o  A <rydeSpecEscrow> element contains the version of the Data Escrow
      Specification (e.g., RFC8909) used to create the deposit.  After
      the specification is published as an RFC, the value MUST be the
      RFC number assigned by IANA.

   o  An OPTIONAL <rydeSpecMapping> element contains the version of the
      Domain Name Registration Data (DNRD) Objects Mapping (e.g.,
      RFC9022) used to create the deposit.  After the specification is
      published as an RFC, the value MUST be the RFC number assigned by
      IANA.  The <rydeSpecMapping> element MUST be included if the
      deposit was created using any version of the DNRD objects mapping
      specification (see [RFC9022]).

   o  A <resend> element contains the value of the "resend" attribute of
      the <deposit>.

   o  A <crDate> element contains the date and time that the Registry
      Operator created the deposit.

   o  A <kind> element is used to identify the kind of deposit: FULL,
      INCR (Incremental), or DIFF (Differential).

   o  A <watermark> element contains the date and time corresponding to
      the Timeline Watermark (<watermark> element) of the <deposit>.

   o  A <rdeHeader:header> element contains the header of the <deposit>
      as defined in [RFC9022].

   An example of a <rdeReport:report> object is available in
   Section 2.1.

1.4.3.  <rdeNotification:notification> object

   The <rdeNotification:notification> object is used by Data Escrow
   Agents to document the result of the data escrow deposit verification
   process.  The XML Schema for the <rdeNotification:notification>
   object can be found in Section 7.3.

   The <rdeNotification:notification> object contains the following
   child elements:

   o  A <deaName> element contains the name of the Data Escrow Agent.

   o  A <version> element contains the version of the specification
      used.  This value MUST be 1.

   o  A <repDate> element contains the reported date.  In the case of a
      DVPN or DVFN notification, this value MUST be the date of the
      <watermark> element of the <deposit>.  In the case of a DRFN
      deposit notification, this value MUST be the date for which no
      deposit was received from the Registrar or Registry Operator.

   o  A <status> element is used to specify the status of <repDate>.
      The possible values of status are DVPN, DVFN, and DRFN.  The three
      types of notices determine the value for the <status> element:

      *  Deposit Receipt Failure Notice (DRFN): generated by the Data
         Escrow Agent when no deposit is received according to the data
         escrow deposit schedule.

      *  Deposit Verification Failure Notice (DVFN): generated by the
         Data Escrow Agent when a deposit is received, but the final
         result of the verification process is a failure.

      *  Deposit Verification Pass Notice (DVPN): generated by the Data
         Escrow Agent when a deposit is received, and the final result
         of the verification process is a success.

   o  An OPTIONAL <results> element contains the errors detected during
      the data escrow deposit verification process performed by the Data

      Escrow Agent.  The <results> element includes one or more
      <iirdea:result> elements as defined in Section 1.4.1.  In the case
      of a DRFN or DVPN deposit notification, the <results> element MUST
      NOT be present.

   o  An OPTIONAL <reDate> element contains the date and time that the
      Data Escrow Agent successfully received the deposit.  In the case
      of a DRFN deposit notification, this element MUST NOT be present.

   o  An OPTIONAL <vaDate> element contains the date and time that the
      Data Escrow Agent processed the deposit for validation.  In the
      case of a DRFN deposit notification, this element MUST NOT be
      present.

   o  An OPTIONAL <lastFullDate> element contains the date of the
      Timeline Watermark (<watermark> element) of the most recent FULL
      deposit that the Data Escrow Agent successfully validated.  This
      element MUST NOT be present if a successfully validated full
      deposit has never been deposited.

   o  An OPTIONAL <rdeReport:report> element is used by the Data Escrow
      Agent to provide extended information about the deposit.  In the
      case of a DRFN deposit notification, this element MUST NOT be
      present.  In the case of a DVPN or DVFN deposit notification, this
      element MUST be present.  When this element is present, the
      <rdeHeader:header> element MUST be generated by the Data Escrow
      Agent for the Timeline Watermark (<watermark> element) of the
      deposit being processed.  If the deposit being processed is a
      differential or incremental deposit, the Data Escrow Agent MUST
      create a dataset by following Section 5.2 of [RFC8909] to generate
      the <rdeHeader:header> element.

   o  Note: In the case of a DVPN or DVFN deposit notification, the <id>
      is used as a unique identifier.

   An example of a <rdeNotification:notification> object is available in
   Section 2.2.

1.4.4.  <rriReporting:summary> Object

   Interfaces that support monitoring the reporting status for a
   specific repository provide a <rriReporting:summary> object as
   defined by the schema in Section 7.4 in the HTTP Entity-body when a
   HTTP/200 code is sent by the interface.

   The <rriReporting:summary> element includes the following child
   elements:

   o  A choice of one of the elements as defined in the
      "rdeHeader:repositoryTypeGroup" (see [RFC9022]) that indicates the
      unique identifier for the repository being escrowed.

   o  A <creationDate> element with the date and time in which the
      queried repository was created in the system.

   o  A <depositSchedule> OPTIONAL element indicating the current Data
      Escrow Deposit schedule for the queried repository.  Possible
      values are "None", "Weekly", and "Daily".

   o  An OPTIONAL <lastFullDate> element indicating the date of the
      Timeline Watermark (<watermark> element) of the most recent FULL
      deposit that was successfully validated for the queried repository
      as notified by the Data Escrow Agent.

   o  A <statusReports> element with a <statusReport> element for each
      report type for the queried repository.  Each <statusReport>
      element includes the following child elements:

      *  <type>: a string value indicating the report type to which the
         information provided pertains.

      *  <enabled>: a boolean value indicating if the report type is
         enabled for the repository.

      *  <status>: a string value indicating the reporting status.  A
         value of "ok" indicates no reporting issues in the
         corresponding report type, otherwise the value of
         "unsatisfactory" is shown.

      *  An OPTIONAL <issues> element included only when the <status>
         element has a value of "unsatisfactory", and includes an empty
         <issue> element for each date with a reporting problem found in
         the corresponding report type.  Each <issue> element includes a
         REQUIRED "date" attribute in "YYYY-MM-DD" format and a REQUIRED
         "description" attribute to describe the issue.  The possible
         values to describe each reporting issue are:

         +  "Missing_Deposit_Full": If the latest notification received
            from the Data Escrow Agent for the date indicates that a
            scheduled "Full" deposit was not submitted by the repository
            owner.

         +  "Missing_Deposit_Diff": If the latest notification received
            from the Data Escrow Agent for the date indicates that a

      received the notification.

   o  A <rdeNotification:notification> element as defined in
      Section 1.4.3 as received by ICANN.

1.4.7.  <schedule:schedule> object

   The <schedule:schedule> object is used to provide details of an
   instance of a maintenance window.  The maintenance window is
   identified by a Universally Unique IDentifier version 4 (see
   [RFC4122]) captured in the attribute "scheduleId".  An additional
   attribute "enabled" defined as a boolean can be used to enable (value
   of true) or disable (value of false) the maintenance window.  The XML
   Schema for the <schedule:schedule> object can be found in
   Section 7.7.

   The <schedule:schedule> object contains the following child elements:

      the definition of <schedule:schedule>.

   An example of a <schedule:schedules> object is available in
   Section 4.

1.4.9.  <probeNode:probeNodes> object

   The <probeNode:probeNodes> object is used to provide the list of
   probe nodes used by the SLA Monitoring System.  The XML Schema for
   the <probeNode:probeNodes> object can be found in Section 7.8.

   The <probeNode:probeNodes> object contains the following child
   elements:

   o  One or more <probeNode> elements.  Each <probeNode> element
      contains the following child elements:

      *  A <city> element contains the name of the city where the node
         is located.

      *  One or more <addr> element contains the IP addresses used in
         the node to originate test connections.  An "ip" attribute
         contains the string "v4" if the IP address is an IPv4 address
         or "v6" if the IP address is an IPv6 address.

   o  A <updateTime> element contains the date and time of the last
      update of the list.

2.  Interfaces for Specification 2 - Data Escrow Reporting

   This section describes the interfaces provided by ICANN to Registry
   Operators and Data Escrow Agents to fulfill the reporting
   requirements detailed in Specification 2 of the gTLD Base Registry
   Agreement [ICANN-GTLD-RA-20170731].

2.1.  Registry Operator Reporting

   The gTLD Base Registry Agreement [ICANN-GTLD-RA-20170731],
   Specification 2, Part A, Section 7 requires Registry Operators to
   provide ICANN with a written statement that includes a copy of the
   report generated upon creation of a deposit and a statement that the

Internet-Draft          ICANN Registry Interfaces               Sep 2021


   deposit has been inspected by the Registry Operator and is complete
   and accurate.

   In order to satisfy this requirement, the Registry Operator sends to
   ICANN a <rdeReport:report> object as defined in Section 1.4.2 for
   each deposit successfully sent to the Data Escrow Agent, using the
   PUT HTTP verb in the interface provided by ICANN at:

      <base-url>/report/registry-escrow-report/<tld>/<id>

      Where:

      *  <tld> MUST be substituted by the TLD for which the report is
         being provided.  In the case of an IDN TLD, the A-label (see
         [RFC5890]) MUST be used.

      *  <id> MUST be substituted by the identifier assigned to this
         report, which MUST be the same as the "id" attribute from the
         <deposit>.

      Note: the interface supports overwriting the information of a
      particular report <id> to support asynchronous interfaces between
      Registry Operators and Data Escrow Agents.

   Example of a <rdeReport:report> object for a data escrow deposit
   corresponding to a TLD Registry repository:

2.2.  Data Escrow Agent Reporting

   The gTLD Base Registry Agreement [ICANN-GTLD-RA-20170731],
   Specification 2, Part B, Section 7 requires Data Escrow Agents to
   deliver ICANN with a notification object every time a successfully
   processed deposit is received from the Registry Operator regardless
   of the final status of the verification process.

   To satisfy this requirement, the Data Escrow Agent sends to ICANN a
   <rdeNotification:notification> object as defined in Section 1.4.3,
   using the POST HTTP verb in the interface provided by ICANN at:

      Where:

      *  <tld> MUST be substituted by the TLD for which the notification
         is being provided.  In the case of an IDN TLD, the A-label (see
         [RFC5890]) MUST be used.

   If by 23:59:59 UTC, a deposit has not been successfully processed
   regardless of the final status of the verification process, a
   <rdeNotification:notification> object with DRFN status MUST be sent
   to ICANN.

         syntactically valid data escrow notification was received for
         the queried date.

      *  The interface provides an HTTP/404 status code if a
         syntactically valid data escrow notification has not been
         received for the queried date.

3.  Interfaces of Specification 3 - Registry Operator Monthly Reporting

   Specification 3 of the gTLD Base Registry Agreement
   [ICANN-GTLD-RA-20170731] requires Registry Operators to provide a set
   of monthly reports per gTLD.  Two types of reports are required to be
   sent by Registries: Per-Registrar Transactions Report and Registry
   Functions Activity Report.  This section specifies the interfaces
   provided by ICANN to automate the upload of these reports by Registry
   Operators.

   The cut-off date for the reception of the reports specified in
   specification 3 is defined in the gTLD Base Registry Agreement
   [ICANN-GTLD-RA-20170731].  Before the cut-off date, the Registry
   Operator MAY replace a successfully validated report as many times as
   needed.

Internet-Draft          ICANN Registry Interfaces               Sep 2021


3.1.  Per-Registrar Transactions Report

   The Per-Registrar Transactions Report is a CSV report encoded in
   UTF-8 described in Section 1 of Specification 3 of the gTLD Base
   Registry Agreement [ICANN-GTLD-RA-20170731].

   To satisfy this requirement, the Registry Operator sends a CSV report
   monthly as described in the gTLD Base Registry Agreement
   [ICANN-GTLD-RA-20170731], using the PUT HTTP verb in the interface
   provided by ICANN at:

      <base-url>/report/registrar-transactions/<tld>/<date>

      Where:

      *  <tld> MUST be substituted by the TLD for which the report is
         being provided.  In the case of an IDN TLD, the A-label (see
         [RFC5890]) MUST be used.

      *  <date> MUST be substituted by the month for which the report is
         being provided in the form of YYYY-MM.  Where 'YYYY' is the
         year, and 'MM' is the two-digit month number.  For example,
         2013-03.

3.2.  Registry Functions Activity Report

   The Registry Functions Activity Report is a CSV report encoded in
   UTF-8 described in Section 2 of Specification 3 of the gTLD Base
   Registry Agreement [ICANN-GTLD-RA-20170731].

   To satisfy this requirement, the Registry Operator sends a CSV report
   monthly as described in the gTLD Base Registry Agreement
   [ICANN-GTLD-RA-20170731], using the PUT HTTP verb in the interface
   provided by ICANN at:

      <base-url>/report/registry-functions-activity/<tld>/<date>

      Where:

      *  <tld> MUST be substituted by the TLD for which the report is
         being provided.  In the case of an IDN TLD, the A-label (see
         [RFC5890]) MUST be used.

      *  <date> MUST be substituted by the month for which the report is
         being provided in the form of YYYY-MM.  Where 'YYYY' is the
         year, and 'MM' is the two-digit month number.  For example,

3.3.  Monitoring the reporting status

   Registries MAY monitor the status of the reports described in
   Specification 3 of the gTLD Base Registry Agreement
   [ICANN-GTLD-RA-20170731] using the following interfaces that support
   the HEAD HTTP verb:

3.3.1.  Monitoring the status of Registry Functions Activity Report

   Registries MAY monitor the status of Registry Functions Activity
   Report using the following interface:

      <base-url>/info/report/registry-functions-activity/<tld>/<date>

      Where:

      *  <tld> MUST be substituted by the TLD being queried.  In the
         case of an IDN TLD, the A-label (see [RFC5890]) MUST be used.

      *  <date> MUST be substituted by the month being queried.  For
         example, 2013-03.

      Possible results are:

      *  The interface provides an HTTP/200 status code if a
         syntactically valid registry functions activity report was
         received for the queried month.

      *  The interface provides an HTTP/404 status code if a
         syntactically valid registry functions activity report has not
         been received for the queried month.

3.3.2.  Monitoring the status of the Per-Registrar Transactions Report

   Registries MAY monitor the status of Per-Registrar Transactions
   Report using the following interface:

      <base-url>/info/report/registrar-transactions/<tld>/<date>

      Where:

      *  <tld> MUST be substituted by the TLD being queried.  In the
         case of an IDN TLD, the A-label (see [RFC5890]) MUST be used.

      *  <date> MUST be substituted by the month being queried.  For
         example, 2013-03.

      *  The interface provides an HTTP/200 status code if a
         syntactically valid per-registrar transactions report was
         received for the queried month.

      *  The interface provides an HTTP/404 status code if a
         syntactically valid per-registrar transactions report has not
         been received for the queried month.

4.  Maintenance Windows

   Specification 10 of the gTLD Base Registry Agreement
   [ICANN-GTLD-RA-20170731] allows Registry Operators to provide notice
   to ICANN about plans of maintenance.  This section specifies the
   interfaces provided by ICANN to programmatically manage maintenance
   windows by Registry Operators.

4.1.  Creating and updating a maintenance window

   To create or update a previously created maintenance window, the
   Registry Operator sends a <schedule:schedule> object (see
   Section 1.4.7) using the PUT HTTP verb in the interface provided by
   ICANN at:

      <base-url>/maintenance-window/<tld>/<service>/<scheduleId>

      Where:

      *  <tld> MUST be substituted by the TLD for which the report is
         being provided.  In the case of an IDN TLD, the A-label (see
         [RFC5890]) MUST be used.

      *  <service> MUST be substituted by a service for which a
         maintenance window could be created (e.g., RDDS).

      *  <scheduleId> MUST be substituted by a Universally Unique
         IDentifier version 4 (see [RFC4122]).

4.2.  Deleting a maintenance window

   To delete a previously created maintenance window, the Registry
   Operator uses the DELETE HTTP verb in the interface provided by ICANN
   at:

      <base-url>/maintenance-window/<tld>/<service>/<scheduleId>

Internet-Draft          ICANN Registry Interfaces               Sep 2021


4.3.  Getting the persisted data for a maintenance window

   To get the persisted data for a maintenance window, the Registry
   Operator uses the GET HTTP verb in the interface provided by ICANN
   at:

      <base-url>/maintenance-window/<tld>/<service>/<scheduleId>

   The interface provides an HTTP/200 status code and sets the HTTP
   header Content-type: text/xml after a successful request, and
   includes a <schedule:schedule> object as defined in Section 1.4.7.

   Example of a <schedule:schedule> object of a Maintenance Window:

 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 <schedule:schedule xmlns:schedule="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:schedule-1.0"
 enabled="true" scheduleId="6257b2b9-1ff7-4159-bc0d-397fec035d38">
     <schedule:name>Maintenance window for RDDS semester II-2017
     </schedule:name>
     <schedule:description>Pre-planned maintenance window for RDDS
     </schedule:description>
     <schedule:startTime>2010-10-17T00:15:00.0Z</schedule:startTime>
     <schedule:endTime>2010-10-17T02:15:00.0Z</schedule:endTime>
     <schedule:version>1</schedule:version>
 </schedule:schedule>

4.4.  Getting a list of maintenance windows

   To get the list of all the maintenance windows that have not ended
   yet (see Section 4), the Registry Operator uses the GET HTTP verb in
   the interface provided by ICANN at:

      <base-url>maintenance-window/<tld>/<service>

   The interface provides an HTTP/200 status code and sets the HTTP
   header Content-type: text/xml after a successful request, and
   includes a <schedule:schedules> object as defined in Section 1.4.8.

   Example of a <schedule:schedules>:

6.  Technical details of the interfaces

   This section describes the technical details of the interfaces
   described in this document.

6.1.  General technical details

   This section describes the technical details that apply to all the
   interfaces described in this document.

   The following HTTP status codes are returned:

   o  The interface provides an HTTP/401 status code and sets the HTTP
      header Content-type: text/plain, if the credentials provided do
      not authorize the user to perform the action requested for that
      <tld>.

   o  The interface provides an HTTP/403 status code and sets the HTTP
      header Content-type: text/plain, if the user attempts to access a
      resource that permission is not granted for, or the connecting IP
      address is not authorized for the <tld>.

   o  The interface provides an HTTP/404 status code if the object
      referenced in the URL is not found.

   o  The interface provides an HTTP/405 status code if the interface
      does not support the request method.

   o  The interface provides an HTTP/500 status code and sets the HTTP
      header Content-type: text/plain, if the system is experiencing a

      general failure.  The sending party is responsible for sending the
      input again.

   o  The interface provides an HTTP/501 status code and sets the HTTP
      header Content-type: text/plain, if the functionality has not yet
      been implemented.

   After sending the response, the interfaces close the TCP connection.

   The interfaces support HTTP streams only (HTTP multi-part forms are
   not supported).

6.2.  Specific technical details

   This section describes the technical details that apply to the
   following interfaces:

   o  Registry Operator Reporting (see Section 2.1)

   o  Data Escrow Agent Reporting (see Section 2.2)

   o  Per-Registrar Transactions Report (see Section 3.1)

   o  Registry Functions Activity Report (see Section 3.2)

   o  Creating and updating a maintenance window (see Section 4.1)

   o  Deleting a maintenance window (see Section 4.2)

   The following additional HTTP status codes are returned:

   o  The interface provides an HTTP/200 status code and sets the HTTP
      header Content-type: text/xml, if the interface was able to
      receive the input successfully, the client MUST review the
      response object (see Section 6.2.1) to verify the result code
      after processing the input.

   o  The interface provides an HTTP/400 status code and sets the HTTP
      header Content-type: text/xml, if the input is incorrect or the
      syntax of the input is invalid.  A response object (see
      Section 6.2.1) is included with the input validation failure
      details.

   Content-type value in the HTTP header:

   o  The client MUST set "text/xml" in the HTTP header Content-type
      when using the interfaces described in Section 2.1, Section 2.2,
      Section 4.1, and Section 4.2.

   3.  Editorial updates.

10.  Internationalization Considerations

   The interfaces described in this document use XML, which provides
   native support for encoding information using the Unicode character
   set and its more compact representations including UTF-8.  Conformant
   XML processors recognize both UTF-8 and UTF-16.  Though XML includes
   provisions to identify and use other character encodings through use
   of an "encoding" attribute in an <?xml?> declaration, use of UTF-8 is
   RECOMMENDED.

11.  IANA Considerations

   This document uses URNs to describe XML namespaces and XML schemas
   conforming to a registry mechanism described in [RFC3688].  Six URI
   assignments have been registered by the IANA.

   Registration request for the RRI IIRDEA Result namespace:

12.  Implementation Status

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section and the reference to
   RFC 7942 [RFC7942] before publication.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC 7942
   [RFC7942].  The description of implementations in this section is
   intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing
   drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual
   implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.
   Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information
   presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not
   intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available
   implementations or their features.  Readers are advised to note that
   other implementations may exist.

   According to RFC 7942 [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and
   working groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the
   benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable
   experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols
   more mature.  It is up to the individual working groups to use this
   information as they see fit".
