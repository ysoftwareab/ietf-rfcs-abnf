 Abstract 
     
    To achieve seamless layer 3 handover, mobile nodes must be able to 
    perform movement detection and neighborhood candidate access routers 
    discovery quickly and efficiently.  
     
    In this document, we present a conceptual overview on how to extend 
    the IEEE 802.11 Management frames to carry extensible application-
    specific Information Element, which allow access points to advertise 
    the capabilities information of its associated network/provider and 
    to improve movement detection. We believe that mobile nodes can thus 
    dynamically discover neighboring candidate access routers or 
    networks more quickly and efficiently, and also to obtain valuable 
    capabilities information so as to select the 'best' target access 
    router to initiate seamless handover.

 2. Introduction 
     
    In Mobile IPv6 [1], a mobile node can effectively maintain its 
    connectivity to the Internet when it changes its point-of-attachment 
    to the Internet. During the handover, the mobile node is unable to 
    send/receive IPv6 packets both due to its L2/L3 handover operations. 
    This handover latency is unacceptable to real-time or delay 
    sensitive traffic/applications. 

 2.1 Movement Detection based on Router Advertisements 
    Whenever a mobile node moves, it is required to perform movement 
    detection by discovering (sending Router Solicitation) its current 
    environment.  
     
    In Mobile IPv6 [1], the movement detection algorithm relies on the 
    periodic Router Advertisements to enable the mobile node to 
    determine their current location. To achieve optimum detection 
    performance, Router Advertisements can be broadcast at a faster 
    rate, which eventually results in poor link utilization. The 
    algorithm can be triggered through the indication from the 
    underlying L2 driver. However, we noted that not all L2 mobility 
    indication from the L2 driver indicates movement of the mobile node 
    to a new subnet (i.e. L3 movement).  
     
    Movement detection, which is achieved through the use of Neighbour 
    Discovery [4] requires routers to send unsolicited Router 
    Advertisement at a minimum interval of 3 seconds [section 6.2.4 of 
    [4]]. Upon receipt of a Router Solicitation message, the router MUST 
    delay its response (i.e. Router Advertisement) by a random time. 
    Lastly, the protocol also requires the mobile node to delay its 
    transmission of the initial solicitation for a random amount of 
    time. Such delay is simply not desirable in achieving seamless 
    handover. However, mobile IPv6 [1] relaxes such limit to allow 
    mobile nodes to quickly detect their movement by listening to Router 
    Advertisements, which are sent at a much faster rate.  

 2.2 Fast-Handoff Protocol 
    The fast handover protocol [2] is designed to achieve seamless 
    handoff of mobile nodes between the access routers.  
     
    In a mobile-initiated anticipated fast-handover described in [2], 
    the mobile node first sends a Router Solicitation for Proxy(RtSolPr) 
    to the current access router containing the link-layer address of 
    the new access point. The current access router replies with 
    RtrAdvPr, which contains the [AP-ID, AR-MAC, AR-IP] tuple. These 
    message exchanges allows a mobile node to obtain the new access

             Recommendations for Achieving Seamless IPv6 Handover 
                           in IEEE 802.11 Networks         February 2003 
  
  
    router's MAC address, which is needed to send packets once the 
    mobile node attaches to the new access router, and also to perform 
    'anticipative' configuration of the new IP address on the new subnet 
    using the New Router Prefix Information option carried in the 
    RtrAdvPr message. 
     
    However, the above protocol assumes that the L2 protocol is capable 
    of delivering the L2 identifier of the new access point to the 
    mobile node. More important, to initiate seamless handover, the 
    current AR must be capable of mapping this new L2 identifier into 
    the IP address of the new AR [6]. Lastly, it assumes that the mobile 
    node or the current access router have a priori knowledge (e.g. 
    capabilities) of the target of the handover (i.e. target access 
    router). 

 3. Proposal Overview 
    One of the challenges in achieving seamless L3 handover is the 
    ability of MN to perform movement detection and to discover and 
    select its new neighboring candidate access router quickly and 
    efficiently that matches closely to the mobile node preferences or 
    requirements. 
     
    In this document, we present an overview on how to extend the IEEE 
    802.11 Management frames to carry extensible application-specific 
    Information Element, which allow access points to advertise the 
    capabilities information of its associated network/provider. The 
    recommendation also improves in the movement detection mechanism by 
    avoiding unnecessary L3 messaging over the wireless link. More 
    importantly, we believe that mobile nodes can dynamically discover 
    neighboring candidate access routers or networks more quickly and 
    efficiently, and also to obtain valuable capabilities information so 
    as to select the 'best' target access router to initiate seamless 
    handover. The recommendation also allows new/removed access routers 
    and access points to be discovered without much human interventions.  

 3.1 Instantaneous/Faster Movement Detection 
    In this section, we describe how to configure the Extended Service 
    Set Identifier (ESSID) of an infrastructure 802.11 network such that 
    it includes the L3 identifier/Information of its associated AR or 
    network. 
     
    With this embedded identifier (e.g. IP address or prefix 
    information), MN can quickly detect movement to a new L3 subnet, 
    thus avoiding transmitting unnecessary L3 messages (i.e. Router 
    Solicitation/Advertisement) and delays.

    To perform instantaneous movement detection, we recommend that APs 
    to include the subnet prefix information for their associated AR 
    (Subnet-Router-Anycast-Address) into the ESSID. This recommendation 
    allows MN to discover new network when it established a L2 
    connection with the new AP in an instantaneous manner.

    However, to improve the inter-cell (802.11) handoff performance, 
    several APs belonging to different administrative domains (different 
    subnets) may choose to share similar ESSID. Therefore, as MN moves 
    across these cells, it only needs to initiate re-association instead 
    of the plain association process, which can take significantly 
    longer. In this case, instead of embedding network prefix 
    information into the ESSID, which is specific to each subnet, AP can 
    include Network-Prefix-Information (section 5.1.1) object using the 
    Application-Specific Information Element (section 5.1) into the 
    beacon frames.

    The table below shows an example of a list of beacon information 
    advertised by the neighboring APs received by the MN on a specific 
    wireless interface with an identifier, mniid.

    When MN moves, the underlying driver can indicate such movement 
    using triggers (e.g. onL2Up during the 802.11 Assoc/Re-Assoc events) 
    to the mobile IP stack. Based on the earlier cached configuration of 
    the new subnet, MN can immediately perform mobile IP operations 
    without performing movement detection using Router Solicitation and 
    Advertisement. 

 4. Dynamic Candidate Access Router Discovery 
    MN constantly listens for any beacons frame advertised by the 
    neighboring APs. When MN discovers a new AP/Advertisement, it stores 
    the advertised capabilities information, which is encapsulated 
    inside the Network-Capabilities-Information Object (section 5.1) 
    into its Neighborhood CAR list.

    MN can store these discovered information ordered by either the 
    signal strength or other parameters (e.g. Pricing). To 
    achieve/assist fast handoff operation, information such as L2/L3 
    address mapping of the AR can be obtained from the Access-Router-
    Information Object (section 5.1.3). 
     
    Therefore, the ability to dynamically discover neighboring CAR's 
    capabilities allows the MN to perform the selection of TAR based on 
    the mobile node's preference or requirements [6]. 

 4.1 Operations  
    In this section, we will briefly describe the operation on the MN.

     |           .               .              .            .   . 
                 .                advertisement              .   . 
     -           | <---------------------------------------- |   | 
                 |               |              |            |   | 
     -           |                assoc/re-assoc             |   |

     -           |               |              |            |   | 
     
    - Neighborhood Discovery Phase (NDP) 
      - MN discovers neighboring APs or networks and creates a list of  
        CARs with their advertised information (Table 2) 
      - Optionally, during the neighborhood discovery phase, MN can 
        configure in advance new CoA for each discovered APs on various  
        different subnets. 
    - 'Panic' Phase (PP) 
       - If the current associated AP's signal strength drops or if the       
         MN discovers a new AP, which offers 'better' service/pricing,  
         MN can immediately perform a handover to this new AP/AR. 
       - MN decides to perform association/re-association with a new AP  
         (e.g. AP3) based on MN's preference/requirements 
       - We assumed here that AP3 is associated with a different subnet; 
         MN will know that it has moved to a new network using the   
         cached information. 
       - Assuming MN is still attached to AP1, it quickly initiates  
         fast-handoff using the cached information of AP3(AR3-L2-ID,

         AR3-L3-ID). 
       - Or if the MN has already obtain a valid CoA for which the new  
         AR has reserved/defended, it can quickly initiate a  
         'lightweight-FHO' (a trigger to indicate movement confirmation) 

 5. Extensible Application-Specific Information Elements 
    We proposed to extend the current IEEE 802.11 Management frames to 
    carry extensible application-specific information elements. For 
    example, the IEEE 802.11 Beacon frame with the newly proposed IE is 
    shown in the figure 2.  
     
    The Extensible Application-specific IE allows future 
    applications/protocols to encapsulate their information into the 
    IEEE 802.11 frame easily, hopefully without much software 
    modification. With the new IE, we believe that valuable information 
    can then be easily included in the IEEE 802.11 Management frames and 
    discovered by roaming MN.

 5.1 Application-Specific Information Objects 
    In this conceptual document, we have proposed several application-
    specific objects to achieve our intended objective. We believed that 
    future application objects could be easily defined and carried 
    through the Extensible-Application Information Element without 
    defining new IEEE 802.11 information elements.

 6. Requirements 
     
    MN should be capable of receiving and passing the new Extensible 
    Application information up from the 802.11 driver to IP layer.  
     
    The IEEE 802.11 AP should be configurable such that new Application-
    specific information can be carried in the 802.11 frames without 
    much hassle. The AP should also be able to include this new IE into 
    the beacon or even the association/re-association frames.
