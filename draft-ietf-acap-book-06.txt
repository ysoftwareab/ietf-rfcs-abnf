Abstract
    
    Storing URLs [URL] for later access has become common in Internet
    applications (for example, web browsers, FTP clients); these saved
    URLs have become known as bookmarks.  It would be desirable to
    access one's bookmarks from multiple clients and multiple machines.
    
    The Application Configuration Access Protocol [ACAP] provides an
    ideal mechanism for storage of bookmarks, providing for ease of
    coordination and synchronization of bookmarks between diverse
    applications and systems, as well as for hierarchy, inheritance, and
    sharing between users.

3.  ACAP Bookmarks Dataset Class
    
    The ACAP Bookmarks dataset class defines a set of attributes for
    each bookmark, and provides for bookmark inheritance and hierarchy.
    
    
3.1.  ACAP Bookmarks Dataset Class Prefix
    
    Datasets whose names begin with "/bookmarks" are assumed to contain
    bookmark entries as defined in this specification.

Internet Draft        ACAP Bookmarks Dataset Class        February 2003


3.2.  ACAP Bookmarks Dataset Hierarchy
    
    Each user may have a hierarchical set of bookmarks.  Nested or
    hierarchical bookmarks (that is, bookmark folders) SHOULD be
    represented using the ACAP Hierarchy.  Any entry in a bookmarks
    dataset can be a hierarchy node by setting the "subdataset"
    attribute.
    
    Inheritance is likely to be useful both for inheriting sets of site
    or group default bookmarks as well as for inheriting user-specific
    bookmarks when using different machines.
    
    
4.  Recommended ACAP Bookmarks Dataset Attributes
    
    A Bookmarks dataset entry MUST have an "entry" attribute.  All other
    attributes are OPTIONAL.
    
    Attributes are specified using Augmented Backus-Naur Form [ABNF],
    including the Core Rules.  All attributes are single-valued and
    textual (do not contain binary data) unless otherwise stated.
    
    The ABNF defines the content of the attribute values prior to their
    encoding as an ACAP string.  Clients MUST conform to the syntax when
    generating these attributes, but MUST NOT assume that the attribute
    values will conform to this syntax on access.  Servers MUST NOT
    enforce the syntax.
    
    
4.1.  Basic Attributes
    
    These attributes are defined in ACAP [ACAP] and have meaning in all
    dataset classes.  The section describes how they are used in a
    bookmarks dataset.
    
    entry
        The "entry" attribute is used to uniquely identify the bookmark.
        The name MUST be unique, but is not expected to be descriptive,
        and generally is not suitable for display to users.  It is
        client-defined.
        
        The "entry" attribute is also used for ordering.  When selecting
        the "entry" attribute for a new bookmark, in addition to
        uniqueness, the client selects a string which causes the new
        entry to appear in the desired order, when sorted using the
        "i;ascii-casemap" comparator [ACAP].  For example, to insert an
        entry between "a1" and "a2", "a1a" could be used.

Internet Draft        ACAP Bookmarks Dataset Class        February 2003


    subdataset
        The "subdataset" attribute indicates that there is a subdataset
        of this entry.  The value of this attribute specifies the actual
        location of the subdataset, per [ACAP] section 3.1.1.  For the
        bookmarks dataset, a value of "." is most commonly used for a
        user's own entries, indicating that the subdataset exists
        directly beneath this one.  However, especially when inheriting
        bookmarks from group or site collections, the value of this
        attribute may point to a dataset on the same or a different ACAP
        server.
    
    
4.2.  Specific Attributes
    
    These attributes are specific to the Bookmarks dataset class.
    
    bookmarks.Date.Added
        This contains the date and time of the original creation of this
        entry.  The value is expressed in UTC with a timezone offset,
        indicating the user's local time.
        
        book-date           = datetime ;specified in Common ABNF
        
    bookmarks.Description
        This contains the user-assigned description of the entry, as a
        series of CRLF-separated lines.
        
        book-description    = *line ;specified in Common ABNF
        
        bookmarks.Last.Modified
        This contains the date and time of the most recent modification
        of the entry.  Modification includes any user-initiated action
        (such as editing the description) but not automatic actions
        (such as updating the "Last.Visited" attribute).  The value is
        expressed in UTC, with a timezone offset indicating the user's
        local time.
        
        book-modtime        = datetime ;specified in Common ABNF
        
    bookmarks.Last.Visited
        This contains the date and time of the most recent access of the
        location represented by the entry's URL.  The value is expressed
        in UTC, with a timezone offset indicating the user's local time.
        
        book-visit          = datetime ;specified in Common ABNF
        
    bookmarks.Name

Internet Draft        ACAP Bookmarks Dataset Class        February 2003


        This specifies a descriptive name for the entry.  It does not
        need to be unique.
        
        book-name           = 1*(VCHAR / SP)
        
    bookmarks.Type
        This contains a token describing the type of the entry.  The
        Separator type indicates the entry is separator for display
        purposes.  The Folder type is used for a container or folder
        (used with ACAP subdatasets).  The Alias type is used for an
        alias entry, in which case the URL is an ACAP URL to an entry in
        an ACAP Bookmarks dataset.  The Link type is used to refer to
        any type of object, for example, a web page or a file.  The
        Frameset type is used to contain the state of a web page with
        frames.  In this case the URL of the main page is contained in
        the 'bookmarks.URL' attribute, and the URLs for other frames are
        contained in subdataset entries.
        
        book-type           = "separator" / "link" / "alias" / "folder"
                              "frameset"
        
    bookmarks.URL
        This contains the URL of the object referred to by this entry.
        For Link type entries, this can be any type of URL.  For Alias
        type entries, this is an ACAP URL.  ACAP URLs are specified in
        [ACAP].
        
        book-url            = url ;defined in [URL]
        
        
5.  Common ABNF
    
    The following [ABNF] rules are used above.
    
        datetime    =   year month day hour minute second timezone 
                        ;UTC and offset to local time
        
        day         =   2DIGIT
        
        hour        =   2DIGIT
        
        line        =   *(VCHAR / SP) CRLF
        
        minute      =   2DIGIT
        
        month       =   2DIGIT
        
        second      =   2DIGIT

8.  Security Considerations
    
    As with ACAP datasets in general, it is important that access
    controls are set correctly on Bookmarks datasets.  Attributes may
    contain personal information which should not be disclosed except by
    explicit owner request.
