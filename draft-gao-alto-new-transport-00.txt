             ALTO Extension: New Transport Layer Protocols
                    draft-gao-alto-new-transport-00

Abstract

   The current ALTO transport is based on HTTP/1.x connections between
   ALTO servers and ALTO clients.  On the other hand, recent extensions
   to HTTP/1.x such as HTTP/2 [RFC7540] and HTTP/3 [I-D.ietf-quic-http]
   introduce capabilities such as server push and stream multiplexing,
   which can potentially be integrated into ALTO to improve ALTO
   capabilities such as incremental updates.  This document identifies
   use cases of ALTO and its extensions that may benefit from the
   advanced features of HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, and proposes ALTO extensions
   to fully leverage the benefits.

1.  Introduction

   The ALTO protocol {{RFC7285} and its extensions are based on HTTP/1.x
   connections between ALTO servers and clients.  Recently, newer
   versions of the HTTP protocol, i.e., HTTP/2 [RFC7540] and HTTP/3
   [I-D.ietf-quic-http], are introduced to the IETF.  The upgrades have
   many benefits such as performance gains and new features, most
   notably server push and stream multiplexing.  While the ALTO base
   protocol should work on top of HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 and gain performance
   improvement without modification, it is worth looking into the
   question of whether and how ALTO can further take advantage of the
   new features.

   The purpose of this document is 1) to identify use cases of the ALTO
   protocol and its extensions that may benefit from the new features of
   HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, and 2) to propose extensions to fully leverage the
   benefits.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

5.  Issues

5.1.  Server Push/Stream Multiplexing for Filtered Services

   An ALTO Client may send multiple requests to the same service with
   different filters, for example, making two different requests to the
   same Filtered Cost Map service.  An intelligent ALTO server may want
   to push the related Filtered Network Maps to the ALTO Client.
   However, the two Filtered Network Maps cannot be distinguished by
   their resource URI alone.

   A similar issue is already discussed in the incremental update
   extension [I-D.ietf-alto-incr-update-sse].

   TBD.

6.  ALTO Extensions

   TBD

7.  Security Considerations

   TBD
