Internet-Draft              XMPP URI Format               September 2003


1. Introduction

   The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [1] has been
   adapted by the XMPP WG from the open protocol originally developed by
   the Jabber community. Currently there exist tens of thousands of
   servers on the Jabber network, with millions of end users. The
   addresses of XMPP entities are not specified as full URIs on the
   network itself, i.e., within the context of the streaming XML
   technology that forms the foundation of XMPP. However, many
   applications external to the existing network would like to address
   XMPP entities as full URIs in compliance with RFC 2396 [2].

   Many types of applications can be built using XMPP. The best-known
   such application is instant messaging (IM) and presence as defined in
   XMPP IM [3]. Therefore it might seem appropriate to use the 'im:' and
   'pres:' URI schemes defined in Common Profile for Instant Messaging
   (CPIM) [4] and Common Profile for Presence (CPP) [5], rather than to
   define an XMPP-specific URI scheme. Unfortunately, these URI schemes
   are limited to instant messaging (usually understood as exchanging
   messages with a single other user) and presence. However,
   fundamentally XMPP is a technology for near-real-time messaging,
   presence, and request-response services using streaming XML, rather
   than only an IM or presence technology. XMPP is already in use in
   applications quite distinct from IM, including network management,
   workflow applications, generic publish-subscribe, remote procedure
   calls, content syndication, gaming, and middleware. These
   applications require an addressing scheme that is not tied to the
   particular semantics of the 'im:' and 'pres:' URI schemes. Therefore,
   this document defines a generic URI scheme that will enable
   applications to fully address any entity that can communicate via
   XMPP.

   On the XMPP network itself, entities must be addressed as <jid>
   rather than <xmpp:jid>. However, some interfaces to XMPP services may
   be provided by non-native applications (e.g., web browsers), and
   other applications may want to refer to XMPP entities using addresses
   that are full URIs. The xmpp: URI format is provided for the sake of
   such interfaces and applications, and MUST NOT be used by native
   applications for addressing on the XMPP network itself.

   An xmpp: URI is opaque rather than hierarchical, and thus is similar
   to a mailto: URI as defined in RFC 2368 [6]. Because an xmpp: URI is
   opaque, it SHOULD contain only the node identifier (optional) and
   domain identifier (required) portions of a JID as defined in Section
   3 of XMPP Core [1] (including by reference all relevant stringprep
   profiles). An xmpp: URI MAY include the resource identifier portion
   of a JID if the XMPP entity must be addressed as such, but this is
   NOT RECOMMENDED since the delimiter used before a resource identifier

   in XMPP addresses is the slash character ("/"), which is discouraged
   by RFC 2396 [2] in opaque URIs.

   If an xmpp: URI is presented in an interface to an XMPP service
   (e.g., in a web browser), interacting with such a URI should trigger
   the application to present a user with an appropriate interface to
   complete an action such as sending a message, sending presence,
   managing a subscription, sending an information request (IQ get), or
   updating relevant information (IQ set).

   This memo conforms to the requirements in Registration Procedures for
   URL Scheme Names [7]. This memo also follows the recommendations in
   Guidelines for new URL Schemes [8].

1.1 Terminology

   This document inherits terminology defined in XMPP Core [1].

   The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
   "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [9].

1.2 Discussion Venue

   The author welcomes discussion and comments related to the topics
   presented in this document. The preferred forum is the
   <xmppwg@jabber.org> mailing list, for which archives and subscription
   information are available at <http://www.jabber.org/cgi-bin/mailman/
   listinfo/xmppwg/>.

1.3 Intellectual Property Notice

   This document is in full compliance with all provisions of Section 10
   of RFC 2026. Parts of this specification use the term "jabber" for
   identifying namespaces and other protocol syntax. Jabber[tm] is a

2. xmpp: URI IANA Registration

   This section provides the information required to register the xmpp:
   URI scheme.

2.1 URI Scheme Name

   xmpp

2.2 URI Scheme Syntax

   The syntax for the xmpp: URI is defined below in Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form as defined by RFC 2234 [10].

   XMPP-URI      = "xmpp:" jid [ "/" resource]
   jid           = [ node "@" ] host
   node          = *( alphanum / escaped /
                   "-" / "_" / "." / "!" / "~" / "*" / "(" / ")" )
   host          = hostname / IPv4address / IPv6reference
   hostname      = *( domainlabel "." ) toplabel [ "." ]
   domainlabel   = alphanum / alphanum *( alphanum / "-" ) alphanum
   toplabel      = alpha / alpha *( alphanum / "-" ) alphanum
   IPv6reference = "[" IPv6address "]"
   IPv6address   = hexpart [ ":" IPv4address ]
   IPv4address   = 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT
   hexpart       = hexseq / hexseq "::" [ hexseq ] / "::" [ hexseq ]
   hexseq        = hex4 *( ":" hex4)
   hex4          = 1*4HEXDIG
   resource      = *( unreserved / escaped )
   reserved      = ";" / "/" / "?" / ":" / "@" / "&" / "=" / "+" /
                   "$" / "," / "[" / "]"


2.3 Character Encoding Considerations

   Representation of non-ASCII character sets in local-part strings is
   limited to the standard methods provided as extensions to RFC 2822
   [11].

2.4 Intended usage

   The xmpp: URI is intended to be used by interfaces to the XMPP
   network from non-native user agents such as web browsers, as well as
   by non-XMPP applications in order to address XMPP entities as full
   URIs.

2.5 Security considerations

4. Security Considerations

   Detailed security considerations for XMPP are given in XMPP Core [1].
   Providing an interface to XMPP services from non-native applications
   introduces new security concerns. For example, the ability to
   interact with XMPP entities via a web browser may expose sensitive
   information to attacks that are not possible or unlikely on a native
   XMPP network. Due care must be taken in deciding what information is
   appropriate for representing in xmpp: URIs; in particular, passwords
   MUST NOT be represented.
