Internet Draft        Dynamic HA Assignment             12 December 2005 
               
 
1. Introduction  
  
   This document adds to the Mobile IP protocol [1], by proposing a 
   messaging mechanism for dynamic home agent assignment and home agent 
   redirection during initial registration.  The goal is to assign an 
   optimal HA for a Mobile IP session.   The mobile node MUST use the 
   Network Access Identifier (NAI) extension [2] when requesting a 
   dynamically assigned HA.   
 
   The MN requests a dynamically assigned HA by setting the HA field in 
   the initial Registration Request to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR (defined in 
   section 2).  If the request is accepted, the HA sends a successful 
   Registration Reply containing the HA's own address.  The requested HA 
   can suggest an alternate HA and if so, the Registration Reply is 
   rejected with a new error code REDIRECT-HA-REQ and the alternate HA 
   address is specified in a new extension (Redirected HA Extension). 
    
   This document also defines a new Requested HA Extension for use in 
   Registration Requests when the HA field is set to ALL-ZERO-ONE-
   ADDRESS.  The Requested HA address is a hint to the network about the 
   MN's preferred HA.   
    
   The messaging mechanism is defined in this document so that the        
   MN can request and receive a dynamic HA address in Mobile IP         
   messages.  However, the mechanism by which the network selects         
   an HA for assignment to the MN is outside the scope of this         
   document.  For example, the selection may be made by any         
   network node that receives the registration request (or         
   information about the registration request), such as a Foreign         
   Agent, AAA server, or Home Agent.   The node that selects the         
   HA may select one based on a number of criteria, including but         
   not limited to HA load-balancing, geographical proximity,         
   administrative policy etc. 
    
    
2.  Requirements Terminology 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [6]. 
    
   The Mobile IP related terminology described in RFC 3344 [1] is used 
   in this document.   In addition, the following terms are used: 
    
   ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR: IP address 0.0.0.0 or 255.255.255.255.  An 
                      address of 255.255.255.255 indicates a preference 
                      for an HA in the home domain.  An address of 
                      0.0.0.0 indicates no preference for home vs.  
                      visited domain.

   Requested HA:      Destination IP address of Home Agent that the 
                      Registration Request is sent to.  Must be a 
                      unicast IP address.  This address can be 
                      obtained as described in section 6.   
                       
                      Note that this specification defines a new 
                      "Requested HA Extension" in section 3.4, which 
                      is different from the term "Requested HA".

   Redirected HA:     If the registration is rejected with error code 
                      REDIRECT-HA-REQ, the HA being referred to is 
                      specified in a new extension (Redirected HA

3.  Problem Statement 
    
   The Mobile IPv4 NAI Extension for IPv4 [2] introduced the concept of 
   identifying a MN by the NAI and enabling dynamic home address 
   assignment.  When the home address is dynamically assigned, it is

Internet Draft        Dynamic HA Assignment             12 December 2005 
               
 
   desirable to discover the Home Agent dynamically or inform the MN 
   about an optimal HA to use for a multitude of reasons, such as: 
    
   - If the distance between the visited network and the home network of 
   the mobile node is large, the signaling delay for these registrations 
   may be long.  In such a case the MN will be anchored to its distant 
   home agent, resulting in tunneled traffic traveling a long distance 
   between home agent and the mobile node.  When a Mobile IP session 
   initiates, if the mobile node can be assigned a home agent that is 
   close to the mobile node it can drastically reduce the latency 
   between the home agent and mobile node. 
    
   - In a large scale Mobile IP deployment, it is cumbersome to 
   provision MNs with multiple HA addresses.   
    
   - It is desirable to achieve some form of load balancing between 
   multiple HAs in the network.  Dynamic HA assignment and/or HA 
   redirection lets the network select the optimal HA from among a set 
   of HAs and thus achieve load balancing among a group of HAs.   
    
   - Local administrative policies. 
    
 
3.1 Scope 
    
    
   This specification does not address the problem of distributing a 
   security association between the MN and HA, and it can either be 
   statically preconfigured or dynamically distributed using other 
   mechanisms [7].   
    
   The draft introduces the terms Requested/Assigned/Redirected HA 
   (section 6).  The discovery of candidate HA addresses for insertion 
   into the Redirected HA Extension can be accomplished through various 
   means which are network and/or deployment specific and hence are 
   outside the scope of this specification. 
    
   The MN MAY request dynamic HA assignment when it is not aware of any 
   HA address and even when it is aware of at least one HA address. 
         
  
3.2 Dynamic Home Agent Discovery in Mobile IPv4      
           
   Mobile IPv4 [1] specifies the mechanism for discovering the mobile 
   node's home agent using subnet-directed broadcast IP address in the 
   home agent field of the Registration Request.   This mechanism was 
   designed for mobile nodes with a static home address and subnet 
   prefix, anchored on fixed home network.   However, using subnet 
   directed broadcast as the destination IP address of the Registration 
   Request, it is unlikely that the Registration Request will reach the 
   home subnet because routers will drop these packets by default.  See 
   CERT Advisory CA-1998-01 Smurf IP Denial-of-Service Attacks [3].

3.3 NAI usage and dynamic HA assignment 
  
   The Mobile IPv4 NAI Extension for IPv4 [2] introduced the 
   concept of identifying a MN by the NAI and enabling dynamic  
   home address assignment.  This document requires that while  
   using dynamic HA assignment, MN MUST use the NAI and obtain a home 
   address.  MN can still suggest a static home address in the 
   Registration Request, but must take the address in the Registration 
   Reply as the home address for the session.  This is compatible with 
   the procedures documented in the NAI specification [2]. 
    
    
3.4 Dynamic HA Extension 
    
   The Dynamic HA Extension, shown in figure 1, contains the address of 
   the HA.  This is a generic extension and can be used in Registration 
   Request and Reply messages.  It is a skippable extension.

       Type          DYNAMIC-HA-ADDRESS (skippable) (to be assigned by 
                    IANA) is the type, which specifies the dynamic HA 
                    address. 
    
       Sub-Type      Defines the use of this extension as: 
                    sub-type 1 = Requested HA Extension 
                             2 = Redirected HA Extension 
    
       Length        Indicates the length of the extension not 
                    including the type, sub-type and length fields.  
                    Length is always 4 bytes.

3.4.1 Requested HA Extension 
    
   The Requested HA Extension is a Dynamic HA Extension of subtype 1. 
    
   The MN may include the Requested HA Extension in the registration 
   request as a hint to the network where it wishes to be anchored.

   This extension contains the address of the HA.  A valid unicast IP 
   address MUST be used as HA address in this extension.   
    
   In absence of an FA, the Registration Request is forwarded to this 
   HA.  In presence of an FA, the FA MUST forward Registration Request 
   to the HA address in this extension. 
  
  
3.4.2 Redirected HA Extension 
  
   The Redirected HA Extension is a Dynamic HA Extension of subtype 2.   
    
   The Redirected HA Extension contains the address of the HA where the 
   MN should attempt the next registration.  The HA receiving a 
   Registration Request can suggest an alternate HA and, if so, the 
   Registration Reply is sent with a new error code REDIRECT-HA-REQ and 
   the alternate HA address is specified in this extension. 
    
   The Redirected HA Extension MUST be included in Registration Reply 
   when the reply code is REDIRECT-HA-REQ. 
    
 
4.  Messaging mechanism for dynamic HA assignment/redirection 
            
   This specification presents two alternatives for home agent 
   assignment.  The two alternatives are:  
   (a) Dynamic HA assignment (described in section 4.1) and  
   (b) HA redirection (described in section 4.2). 
 
4.1 Messaging for dynamic HA assignment 
    
   The following sequence of events occurs when the MN requests dynamic 
   Home Agent assignment: 
    
   1. The MN sets the Home Agent address field in the Registration 
      Request to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR.  If the MN is aware of a desired HA 
      address, it can add that address in the Requested HA Extension in 
      the Registration Request. If the HA does not support the 
      Requested HA Extension, see step 2 below. 
    
   2. This step is applicable, in lieu of step 1, for a MN that is 
      aware of the HA address and desires dynamic HA assignment. Also, 
      the MN follows this (when aware of a HA address) when it 
      discovers a legacy FA in the path or if the known HA does not 
      support the Requested HA Extension (see section 10). 
       
      The MN sets the Home Agent address field in the Registration 
      Request to the HA address (instead of setting it to ALL-ZERO-ONE-
      ADDR). The MN also adds the same HA address in the Requested HA 
      Extension in the Registration Request.

Internet Draft        Dynamic HA Assignment             12 December 2005 
               
 
   3. The MN (if using co-located CoA and registering directly with the 
      HA) or the FA (if the MN is registering via the FA) sends the 
      Registration Request to the "Requested HA".  If the Requested HA 
      Extension is present, Requested HA is specified in the "HA 
      Address" of this extension. 
      Per section 10, in case of a legacy FA, legacy FA forwards the 
      Registration Request to the address in the HA field of the 
      Request (thus, MN uses step 2 above in case of legacy FA instead 
      of step 1). 
    
   4. The "Requested HA" is the home agent that processes the 
      Registration Request in accordance with Mobile IPv4 [1] and as 
      per the specification in this document.  It creates mobility 
      binding for successful Registration Request.  It also sends a 
      Registration Reply to the MN. 
    
   5. The MN obtains an "Assigned HA" address from the HA field in the 
      successful Registration Reply and uses it for the remainder of 
      the session.  (Note that the "Assigned HA" will be same as the 
      "Requested HA"). 
    
   6. Subsequent Registration Request messages for renewal are sent to 
      the Assigned HA. 
 
   Section 5.3.1 describes the Assigned HA in detail.  Some ideas on how 
   to select the Requested HA are briefly covered in section 6.   
 
 
4.1.1 Example with Message Flow Diagram 
    
   Detailed explanation of this alternative is best described with the 
   help of a message flow diagram and description.   
    
   Figure 2 shows one specific example of a Mobile Node using an FA-
   located Care of Address (FA CoA) and FA understands the Requested HA 
   Extension per this specification.   
    
   Other scenarios such as when the mobile node uses a co-located care 
   of address and presence of a legacy HA or FA are not described below, 
   but the behavior is similar.

   1.  The MN sets the Home Agent address field in the Registration 
   Request to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR.  Since the MN is using FA CoA in this 
   example, it sends the Registration Request to the FA.  The 
   Registration Request is formatted as follows: 
    
   +-----------------------------------------------------------+  
   | Src IP=| Dest IP =  | MN HoA  |    HA Address =   | CoA = |  
   |  MN    |    FA      |         | ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR |FA CoA |  
   +-----------------------------------------------------------+  
    
   If the MN is aware of a desired HA address, it can add that address 
   in the Requested HA Extension in Registration Request as a hint.  
   That extension is not shown above. 
        
   2.  The FA sends the Registration Request to the Requested HA.  If 
   Requested HA Extension is present, Requested HA is the HA address in 
   this extension.  If the Requested HA Extension is not present, the FA 
   determines the Requested HA through means outside the scope of this 
   specification.  The Registration Request is formatted as follows: 
    
   +-----------------------------------------------------------+  
   | Src IP=| Dest IP =  | MN HoA  |    HA Address =   | CoA = |  
   |  FA    |Requested HA|         | ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR |FA CoA |  
   +-----------------------------------------------------------+   
    
   (If MN includes the Requested HA Extension, the FA copies that 
   extension.  The FA then forwards the Registration Request, along with 
   the Requested HA Extension, to the HA address specified in Requested 
   HA Extension.) 
       
   3.  The HA processes the Registration Request in accordance with 
   Mobile IPv4 [1] and the messaging defined in this document.  The HA 
   creates mobility binding for successful request and becomes the 
   Assigned HA.  The HA then sends Registration Reply to the FA, which 
   is formatted as follows: 
    
   +-----------------------------------------------------------+  
   | Src IP=| Dest IP =  | MN HoA  |    HA Address =   | CoA = |  
   |Assigned| Src IP of  |         |    Assigned HA    |FA CoA/|  
   |   HA   | the RRQ    |         |                   |       | 
   +-----------------------------------------------------------+   
       
   4.  The FA relays the Registration Reply to the MN, as follows.

   | Src IP=| Dest IP =  | MN HoA  |    HA Address =   | CoA = |  
   |  FA    |    MN      |         |    Assigned HA    |FA CoA/|  
   +-----------------------------------------------------------+   
    
   5.  The MN obtains the Assigned HA address from the HA field in the 
   successful Registration Reply and uses it for the remainder of the 
   session.  The MN sends subsequent Re-Registration or De-Registration 
   Requests for the remainder session directly to the Assigned HA.  The 
   Home Agent address field in this Registration Request is set to 
   ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR.  Note that the Assigned HA is the same as the 
   Requested HA. 
    
    
    
4.2 Messaging for HA redirection 
    
   This section describes the events that occur when the Requested HA 
   does not accept the Registration Request and redirects the mobile 
   node to another HA (aka Redirected HA) instead. This behavior is not 
   exhibited by a legacy HA and so is not referred in the description 
   below. In presence of a legacy FA, please refer to section 4.1 for 
   the specific field in the Registration Request. 
    
   1. The MN sets the Home Agent address field in the Registration 
     Request to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR. 
    
   2. The MN (if using co-located CoA and registering directly with the 
     HA) or FA (if the MN is registering via the FA) sends the 
     Registration Request to the "Requested HA".  If the MN is aware of 
     an HA address, it can add that address in the Requested HA 
     Extension in Registration Request. 
    
   3. When the HA receives the Registration Request, if the HA field is 
     set to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR, the HA may reject the request with Reply 
     code REDIRECT-HA-REQ and suggest an alternate HA.   
      
     The HA may reject the Request for a number of reasons, which are 
     outside the scope of this specification.  If the HA rejects the 
     Request, the HA field in the Reply is set to this HAs address.  
     The IP address of the HA that is the target of the redirection is 
     specified in Redirected HA Extension.  The presence of this 
     extension is mandatory when the reply code is set to REDIRECT-HA-
     REQ.  HA sends the Reply to the FA/MN. 
      
   4. FA sends the Reply to the MN.   
    
   5. If the error code is set to REDIRECT-HA-REQ, MN obtains the HA 
     address from Redirected HA Extension.  The MN then sends a 
     Registration Request to Redirected HA.  The MN may choose to add 
     Requested HA extension in this new Registration Request.  If a 
     registration loop occurs (the case when the Redirected HA is an HA

     that had already directed the MN to register elsewhere) then the 
     MN stops sending any further Registration Request and provides an 
     indication that the loop event was detected.  The number of 
     consecutive Redirected HAs remembered by MN for loop detection is 
     an implementation parameter. 
 
4.2.1 Example with Message Flow Diagram 
    
   Figure 3 shows one specific example of a Mobile Node using FA-located 
   Care of Address, where the FA is not a legacy FA.

      Figure 3: Example message flow for HA redirection 
    
    
   1.  The MN sets the Home Agent address field in the Registration 
   Request to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR.  Since the MN is using FA CoA in this 
   example, it sends the Registration Request to the FA.  The 
   Registration Request is formatted as follows: 
    
    
    
   +-----------------------------------------------------------+  
   | Src IP=| Dest IP =  | MN HoA  |    HA Address =   | CoA = |  
   |  MN    |    FA      |         | ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR |FA CoA | 
   +-----------------------------------------------------------+   
    
   If the MN is aware of an HA address, it can add that address in the 
   Requested HA Extension in Registration Request as a hint.  That 
   extension is not shown above. 
        
   2.  The FA sends the Registration Request to the Requested HA.  If 
   Requested HA Extension is present, Requested HA is the HA address in 
   this extension.  If the Requested HA Extension is not present, the FA 
   determines the Requested HA through means outside the scope of this 
   specification.  The Registration Request is formatted as follows:

   |  FA    |Requested HA|         | ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR |FA CoA | 
   +-----------------------------------------------------------+   
       
   3.  The HA processes the Registration Request in accordance with 
   Mobile IPv4 [1] and the messaging defined in this specification.  If 
   the registration is successful, but local configuration/ 
   administrative policy etc.  directs HA to refer the MN to another HA, 
   the HA rejects the Request with error code REDIRECT-HA-REQ.  The HA 
   fills in the address of the Redirected HA in the Redirected HA 
   Extension.  The HA then sends Registration Reply reject to the FA, 
   which is formatted as follows: 
    
   +-----------------------------------------------------------+  
   | Src IP=| Dest IP =  | MN HoA  |    HA Address =   | CoA = |  
   |        | Src IP of  |         |       HA          |FA CoA |

   | Redirected HA Extension ...                               | 
   +-----------------------------------------------------------+   
       
   4.  The FA relays the Registration Reply to the MN, as follows.   
    
   +-----------------------------------------------------------+  
   | Src IP=| Dest IP =  | MN HoA  |    HA Address =   | CoA = |  
   |  FA    |    MN      |         |       HA          |FA CoA/|  
   +-----------------------------------------------------------+   
   | Redirected HA Extension ...                               | 
   +-----------------------------------------------------------+   
    
   5.  If the MN can authenticate the Reply, the MN extracts the HA 
   address from the Redirected HA Extension.  The MN then sends a 
   Registration Request to the Redirected HA, unless it has already 
   received a redirection response from that HA while processing the 
   Registration Request.  The MN may choose to add Requested HA 
   extension in this new Registration Request. 
    
    
    
5.  Mobility Agent Considerations  
  
   The following sections describe the behavior of each mobility agent 
   in detail. 
    
  
5.1 Mobile Node Considerations           
    
   The mobile node MUST use the NAI extension for home address 
   assignment when using the messaging mechanism in this document.  
   Since MN uses the NAI extension, the Home Address field is set to 
   0.0.0.0.   
  
Kulkarni, Patel, Leung      Expires June 12, 2006         [Page 12] 
    
Internet Draft        Dynamic HA Assignment             12 December 2005 
               
 
    
   While dynamic HA assignment is in progress and the MN has not 
   successfully anchored at a Home Agent, the MN MUST set the Home Agent 
   field in the Registration Request to an ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR, which is 
   either 255.255.255.255 or 0.0.0.0.   
 
   The Registration Request MUST be protected by a valid authenticator 
   as specified in Mobile IPv4 [1] or Mobile IPv4 Challenge/Response 
   Extensions [5].  Configuring security associations is deployment 
   specific and hence outside the scope of this specification.  The 
   security associations between a MN and an individual HA may also be 
   dynamically derived during the dynamic HA assignment, based on a 
   shared secret between MN and AAA infrastructure [7].   
       
   The mobile node MUST maintain the remaining Mobile IP session with 
   the Assigned HA.   
    
   As mentioned in the Security Considerations (Section 9), there is a 
   possibility of more than one HA create a mobility binding entry for a 
   given MN, if a rogue node in the middle captures the Registration 
   Request and forwards it to other Home Agents.  MN can mitigate such 
   condition by using a short lifetime (e.g. 5 seconds) in the 
   Registration Request with Home Agent field set to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR. 
    
   The following sections describe MN behavior in FA CoA mode and co-
   located CoA mode. 
    
    
5.1.1 MN using FA CoA 
    
   When a mobile node initiates a Mobile IP session requesting dynamic 
   HA assignment, it MUST set the home agent address field in the 
   Registration Request to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR.  The destination IP 
   address of the Registration Request is the FA.  The FA will determine 
   the Requested HA and forward the Registration Request to the 
   Requested HA.  Registration Request processing takes place on the 
   Requested HA as per the specification in this draft. 
 
   The Registration Request MUST be appropriately authenticated for the 
   HA to validate the Request. 
    
   If a successful Registration Reply is received, the MN obtains the 
   Assigned HA from the HA field of Reply.  The Assigned HA address will 
   be the same as the Requested HA Extension, if it was included in the 
   Registration Request by the MN.   
    
   If a Registration Reply is received with code REDIRECT-HA-REQ, the MN 
   MUST authenticate the Reply based on HA address in HA field of Reply 
   and attempt Registration with the HA address specified in the 
   Redirected HA Extension.  The MN MUST put the Redirected HA address 
   as the Requested HA Extension of the new Registration Request.

Internet Draft        Dynamic HA Assignment             12 December 2005 
               
 
   In some cases, for the first Registration Request the MN may want to 
   hint to the network to be anchored at a specific HA.  The MN SHOULD 
   put that address in the HA address of the Requested HA Extension. 
    
    
5.1.2 MN using Co-located CoA 
    
   An MN in co-located CoA mode requesting dynamic HA assignment MUST 
   set the home agent address field in the Registration Request to ALL-
   ZERO-ONE-ADDR.  The destination IP address of the Registration 
   Request is the Requested HA.  Some ideas on how to select a Requested 
   HA are briefly covered in section 6.   
    
   If a successful Reply is received, the MN obtains the Assigned HA 
   address from the successful Registration Reply.  The Assigned HA will 
   be the same as Requested HA to which the Registration Request was 
   sent.  The MN MUST cache the Assigned HA address for the length of 
   the Mobile IP session.  The mobile node then MUST use this previously 
   cached Assigned HA address as the home agent address in subsequent 
   re-registration and de-registration request(s).  This will make sure 
   that for the duration of the Mobile IP session, the mobile node will 
   always be anchored to the assigned home agent with which it was 
   initially registered. 
    
   If a Registration Reply is received with code REDIRECT-HA-REQ, the MN 
   MUST authenticate the Reply based on HA address in HA field of Reply 
   and attempt Registration with the HA address specified in the 
   Redirected HA Extension.  The MN MUST put the Redirected HA in the 
   Requested HA Extension of the new Registration Request. 
    
   In some cases, for the first Registration Request MN may want to hint 
   to the network to be anchored at a specific HA and the MN SHOULD put 
   that address in the HA address of the Requested HA Extension. 
    
   While requesting dynamic HA assignment and registering directly with 
   an HA, the Requested HA Extension MUST be included and MUST contain 
   the address of the HA to which the Registration Request is sent.  
   When using co-located CoA but registering via a legacy FA, the HA 
   field in Reqistration Request may be set to Requested HA. 
    
   If the Registration Request contains the Requested HA Extension, the 
   HA address in that extension MUST match the destination IP of the 
   Request. 
    
    
5.1.3 Refreshing Assigned HA Address on Mobile Node 
    
   When the Mobile IP session terminates, the mobile node MAY clear the 
   Assigned HA address cached as the home agent address.  It MAY request 
   a new HA address for the new Mobile IP session by not including the 
   Requested HA Extension.  The advantage of this approach is that the 

  
Kulkarni, Patel, Leung      Expires June 12, 2006         [Page 14] 
    
Internet Draft        Dynamic HA Assignment             12 December 2005 
               
 
   mobile node will be always anchored to an optimal home agent from 
   where it initiated the Mobile IP session.   
 
   Alternately, the MN may save the Assigned HA address and use it in 
   the Requested HA Extension along with ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR HA address in 
   Registration Request for a new Mobile IP session. 
 
5.2 Foreign Agent Considerations 
    
   When the mobile node is using a FA CoA it always registers via the 
   FA.  When the MN is using a co-located CoA it may register through a 
   FA or it may register directly with an HA, unless the R bit is set in 
   the FA's agent advertisement, in which case it always registers 
   through the FA.   
    
   When the FA receives a Registration Request with HA address field set 
   to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR that doesn't contain the Requested HA Extension, 
   the FA obtains the Requested HA address to forward the Registration 
   Request using means outside the scope of this specification.  Some 
   ideas on how to select a Requested HA are briefly covered in section 
   6.   
    
   If the FA cannot obtain the Requested HA to which to forward a 
   Registration Request from MN, it MUST reject request with error code 
   NONZERO-HA-REQD. 
    
   If the MN has included the Requested HA Extension, the FA MUST 
   forward Registration Request to the address in this extension.  If 
   the HA address in this extension is not a routable unicast address, 
   the FA MUST reject request with error code NONZERO-HA-REQD. 
    
   If the Registration Request contains the Requested HA Extension, the 
   FA uses that address as the destination for the relayed Registration 
   Request. 
    
   Backward compatibility issues related to the mobility agents are 
   addressed in section 10. 
    
    
5.3 Home Agent Considerations 
    
   A Home Agent can process an incoming Registration Request in one of 
   the following two ways: 
    
   1.  The MN or FA sends the Registration Request to the Requested HA.  
   The term Requested HA has meaning in the context of a Registration 
   Request message.  When the Requested HA successfully processes the 
   Registration Request and creates a binding and sends a Reply with its 
   address, it becomes the Assigned HA.  The term Assigned HA is 
   meaningful in the context of a Registration Reply message.

Internet Draft        Dynamic HA Assignment             12 December 2005 
               
 
   2.  A Home Agent receiving a Registration Request with HA field set 
   to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR MAY reject the request even if successfully 
   authenticated and suggest an alternate HA address in Reply.  In such 
   a case, the HA puts its own address in HA field of Reply and sets the 
   Reply code to REDIRECT-HA-REQ and adds the Redirected HA Extension. 
    
   If the Registration Request contains the Requested HA Extension, the 
   HA address in that extension must match the destination IP of the 
   Request.  If it does not match, the Requested HA MUST reject the 
   Registration Request with error code 136. 
    
5.3.1 Assigned Home Agent Considerations  
    
   The HA that processes the incoming Registration Request fully in 
   accordance with Mobile IPv4 [1] and this specification becomes the 
   Assigned HA.  The Registration Request terminates at the Assigned HA.   
    
   The Assigned HA creates one mobility binding per MN and sends 
   Registration Reply to the MN by copying its address in the home agent 
   field and as the source IP address of the Reply. 
 
   The following table summarizes the behavior of the Assigned HA, based 
   on the value of the destination IP address and Home Agent field of 
   the Registration Request.

                              field of Reject.  HA suggests an 
                              alternate HA to use in the new 
                              Redirected HA Extension. 
    
   Table 1: Registration Request handling at Assigned HA 
    
 
   As per the messaging proposed here, the mobile node (or the foreign 
   agent) sends the Registration Request to the Requested HA address, 
   which is a unicast address.  Therefore, this document does not 
   specify any new behavior for the case where the HA receives a subnet 
   directed broadcast Registration Request as specified in section 
   3.8.2.1 of the Mobile IPv4 specification [1].   Although the Home 
   Agent field in the Registration Request is not a unicast address, the 
   destination IP address is a unicast address.   This avoids the 
   problem associated with subnet-directed broadcast destination IP 
   address that may result in multiple HAs responding.   Thus, there is 
   no need to deny the registration as stated in Mobile IPv4 [1] section 
   3.8.3.2. 
 
   When the destination IP address is a unicast address and the Home 
   Agent field is ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR, the HA accepts/denies registration 
   and sets the HA field to its own IP address in the reply (i.e.  the 
   registration is not rejected with error code 136).   
      
   The HA can reject the request with the error code REDIRECT-HA-REQ and 
   suggest an alternate HA.  This redirection can be used for load 
   balancing, geographical proximity based on care-of-address or other 
   reasons.  The HA puts its own address in HA field of the Registration 
   Reply message and puts the address of the redirected HA in the 
   Redirected HA Extension.  If the HA accepts the Request, it sets the 
   HA field in the Registration Reply to its own address. 
 
   The Requested HA always performs standard validity checks on the 
   Registration Request.  If there is any error, the Registration 
   Request is rejected with error codes specified in Mobile IPv4 [1]. 
    
    
6.  Requested Home Agent Selection 
    
   When dynamic HA assignment is requested, the MN (or FA in the case of 
   registration via FA) sends the Registration Request to the Requested 
   HA.   This address MUST be a unicast IP address.  If the MN has 
   included a Requested HA Extension in Registration Request, the HA 
   address in this extension is the Requested HA. 
    
   Some example methods by which the MN or the FA may select the 
   Requested HA are briefly described below: 
    
   DHCP:

Internet Draft        Dynamic HA Assignment             12 December 2005 
               
 
    
   MN performs DHCP to obtain an IP address on the visited network.  The 
   Requested HA is learned from the DHCP Mobile IP Home Agent Option 68 
   [4].  MN sends Registration Request directly to this HA and receives 
   the Assigned HA to be used for the remainder of the Mobile IP 
   session. 
    
    
   AAA: 
    
   MN performs challenge/response [5] with the FA.  The FA retrieves the 
   Requested HA from the AAA server and forwards the Registration 
   Request directly to this HA.   The Assigned HA sends a Registration 
   Reply to the FA, which relays it to the MN.   MN uses the Assigned HA 
   for the remainder of the Mobile IP session. 
    
    
   DNS: 
    
   In this case the hostname of the HA is configured on the MN or 
   obtained by some other means; e.g., using a service location 
   protocol.  MN performs DNS lookup on the HA hostname.  The DNS 
   infrastructure provides a resource record with information to 
   identify the optimal HA to the MN.  The MN sends a Registration 
   Request directly to the HA and receives the Assigned HA to be used 
   for remainder of the Mobile IP session. 
    
   Static configuration: 
    
   The HA address is statically configured on the MN.  The MN sends the 
   Registration Request to the configured address.  The Requested HA may 
   then redirect the MN to a Redirected HA. 
 
 
7.  Error Values 
    
   Each entry in the following table contains the name and value for the 
   error code to be returned in a Registration Reply.  It also includes 
   the section in which the error code is first mentioned in this 
   document. 
    
    
   Error Name       Value  Section  Description 
   ---------------  -----  -------  ----------------------------- 
   NONZERO-HA-REQD   XX     5.2     Non-zero HA address required 
                                    in Registration Request. 
   REDIRECT-HA-REQ   YY     5.3     Reregister with redirected HA. 
    
  
8.  IANA Considerations

   The code value NONZERO-HA-REQD is a Mobile IP response code [1] taken 
   from the range of values associated with rejection by the foreign 
   agent (i.e. value in the range 64-127).   
    
   The code value REDIRECT-HA-REQ is a Mobile IP response code [1] taken 
   from the range of values associated with rejection by the home agent 
   (i.e. value in the range 128-192).   
    
   The Dynamic HA Extension is assigned from the range of values 
   associated with skippable extensions at the home agent (i.e. value in 
   the range 128-255). 
    
   IANA should record the values as defined in Section 7 and 3.4. 
    
    
9.  Security Considerations 
    
   This specification assumes that a security configuration has been 
   preconfigured between the MN and the HA or is configured along with 
   the initial Registration Request/Registration Reply as per [7].   
    
   There is a possibility of more than one HA create a mobility binding 
   entry for a given MN, if a man in the middle captures the 
   Registration Request with HA field set to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR and 
   forwards it to other HAs.  This scenario assumes that the rogue node 
   can find out the addresses of the HAs which are able to authenticate 
   the Registration Request.  It also assumes that the rogue node has 
   the capability to store, duplicate, and send packets to the other HAs 
   within the limited time of the replay window. Otherwise these HAs 
   will reject the Registration Requests anyway.  In addition, this type 
   of attack is only possible when the Requested HA Extension is not 
   included in the registration message.  The Mobile Node can minimize 
   the duration of this condition by using a short lifetime (e.g. 5 
   seconds) in the Registration Request. 
    
   This specification does not change the security model established in 
   Mobile IPv4 [1].  Mobile Nodes are often connected to the network via 
   wireless links, which may be more prone to passive eavesdropping or 
   replay attacks.  Such an attack might lead to bogus registrations or 
   redirection of traffic or denial of service.   
    
   As per the messaging in this draft, the Assigned Home Agent will 
   process the incoming Registration Request as per Mobile IPv4 [1].  
   Hence the Assigned Home Agent will have same security concerns as 
   that of the Home Agent in Mobile IPv4 [1].  They are addressed in 
   Section 5 "Security Considerations" of Mobile IPv4 [1]. 
    
   The Registration Request and Registration Reply messages are 
   protected by a valid authenticator as specified in Mobile IPv4 [1].  
   Configuring security associations is a deployment specific issue and 
   is covered by other Mobile IP specifications.  There can be many ways

Internet Draft        Dynamic HA Assignment             12 December 2005 
               
 
   of configuring security associations, but this specification does not 
   require any specific way.   
       
   An example is where the security association between an MN and an 
   individual HA (Requested or Assigned) is dynamically derived during 
   the registration process based on a shared secret between MN and AAA 
   infrastructure, as defined in [7].  The Registration Request is 
   protected with MN-AAA authentication extension and Registration Reply 
   is protected with MN-HA Authentication Extension.  Because the 
   security association is shared between MN and AAA, any dynamically 
   assigned HA in the local domain can proxy authenticate the MN using 
   AAA as per [7]. 
       
   The Assigned Home Agent authenticates each Registration Request from 
   the mobile node as specified in Mobile IPv4 [1] and/or RFC-3012.  The 
   MN also authenticates the Registration Reply from the Assigned HA, 
   thus the existing trust model in Mobile IPv4 [1] is maintained. 
               
    
10.  Backward Compatibility Considerations 
    
   In this section, we examine concerns that may arise when using this 
   specification in a mixed environment where some nodes implement the 
   specification and others do not.   In each of the examples below, we 
   consider the case where one node is a "Legacy" node which does not 
   implement the specification in the context of other nodes which do. 
    
   Legacy Home Agent:  
    
   Legacy home agents may reject the Registration Request with error 
   code 136 because the Home Agent field is not a unicast address.  
   However, some legacy HA implementations may coincidentally process 
   the Registration Request in accordance with this draft, when the HA 
   field in Registration Request is set to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR. 
    
   Legacy Foreign Agent: 
    
   Legacy foreign agents may forward a Registration Request with home 
   agent field set to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR by setting the destination IP 
   address to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR.   This will result packet being dropped 
   or incidentally handled by a next hop HA, adjacent to the FA.  The MN 
   may not be aware of the dropped Registration Request and may probably 
   retry registration, thereby increasing the delay in registration.    
    
   To reduce the delay in registration, the MN should take following 
   steps: 
    
  1. The MN should send the Registration Request as specified in this 
     specification.  In other words, the MN should set the home agent 
     field in the Registration Request to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR and also add 
     the Requested HA Extension.

Internet Draft        Dynamic HA Assignment             12 December 2005 
               
 
  2. If the MN does not receive a Registration Reply within some time 
     and/or after sending a few Registration Requests, it can assume 
     that the Registration Request(s) has been dropped, either by a 
     legacy FA or an incorrect HA.  In addition, if the registration is 
     denied with error code 70 (poorly formed Request), the MN can 
     assume that the legacy FA cannot process this message.  In either 
     case, the MN should fall back to a recovery mechanism.  The MN 
     should quickly send a new Registration Request as mentioned in 
     section 4.1 step 2.  This step will ensure that a legacy FA will 
     forward the Registration Request to the Home Agent thereby making 
     dynamic HA assignment possible.  
 
   Legacy Mobile Node: 
    
    A MN that sends a registration request to an FA which can do dynamic 
    HA assignment, but does not set the HA field to ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR 
    will continue to be registered with its statically configured HA, 
    exactly according to RFC 3344.
