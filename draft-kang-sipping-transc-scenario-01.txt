Abstract 
 
   This document presents miscellaneous transcoding error cases and 
   multi-transcoding scenarios. The miscellaneous transcoding errors 
   can occur where there is a codec mismatch between two parties during 
   SIP/SDP codec negotiation in a multi-transcoding environment. The 
   multi-transcoding scenarios are useful for network environments with
   a signaling/media path separation and multi-transcoding.

1. Introduction  
    
   Communication media is getting more diverse in terms of the types of 
   network terminals. Therefore, the era of new communication media 
   types through several kinds of network terminals such as hardware IP 
   phones and software IP phones, POTS phones, ISDN phones and mobile 
   phones has been coming. 
    
   We believe that transcoding services are a key solution to supporting 
   uncommon communication media in heterogeneous networks and different 
   capability terminals. Some examples of heterogeneous networks are 
   ones between PSTN and 3GPP/3GPP2, PSTN and Internet Telephony, or 
   Internet Telephony and 3GPP/3GPP2. Uncommon communication media can 
   occur with communication between voice and text, video/voice and 
   voice, or video/voice and text. Codecs have adapted depending on 
   networks, media types, and applications. We need to define 
   transcoding error and scenario between different codecs for 
   BcN(broadband convergence network). 
    
   Speech codecs have been used in different networks according to the 
   network characteristics; G.711 in PSTN, AMR in GSM/3GPP, EVRC, QCELP 
   or SMV in 3GPP2. End users have adopted any codec since internet 
   phone; G.723.1, G.729, G.711, and internet Low Bit Rate Codec (iLBC). 
   ITSP(Internet Telephony Service Provider) tries to provide a 
   transcoding function for a wider service coverage. Thus, it is 
   possible to communicate between users without a common codec. 
    
   A transcoding function is needed in cases of interworking between 
   different networks with different codecs and communicating between 
   different applications as well as cases in support of deaf, hard of 
   hearing and speech-impaired individuals 
    
   The IETF sipping WG has been developing three models with SIP[1] for 
   transcoding services: ToIP(Text over IP), Third Party Call Control 
   Transcoding Model, and Conference Bridge Transcoding Model[3-8]. 
   Transcoding SHOULD apply by the principle based on SIP and SDP 
   Offer/Answer[2]. 
    
   This document presents miscellaneous transcoding error cases and the 
   multi-transcoding scenarios. The miscellaneous transcoding error can 
   occur where there is a codec mismatch between two parties during 
   SIP/SDP codec negotiation in a multi-transcoding environment. 
    
   The error cases and scenarios in this document are helpful for more 
   specifically defining error cause and/or a solution of ITSP 
   interworking. Scenarios are useful for network environment of 
   signaling/media path separation and multi-transcoding.

2. Scope 
    
   This document is focused on error cases and scenarios for multi-
   transcoding. The cases and scenarios can be used in network 
   environments: broadband convergence networks with SIP based internet, 
   2G, 2.5G, 3G, CDMA, ISDN, and PSTN. 
    
   This document excludes SIP/SDP Codec OFFER/ANSWER, Codec format 
   Error, bit stream inconsistency between both sides, and connectivity
   error. 
    
    
3. Terminology 
    
   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", 
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT 
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as 
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [11] and indicate requirement levels 
   for compliant implementations.

5. Response code for Miscellaneous Transcoding Error Cases 
    
    
   There are two paths at each node between calling party and called 
   party[13-14]. One is signaling path. The other is media path. Client

   side has both of them in one physical entity, even though it has two 
   paths logically. Intermediary node T has two separate paths logically 
   and physically. The signaling path will be located at T. The media 
   path will be located at T'. T negotiates supportable media to 
   adjacent party by SIP/SDP. T' supports media to adjacent party by 
   transcodec.  
    
   Data at T for a codec negotiating MUST consist of supporting media at 
   T'. The method for maintain consisting between T and T' is beyond the 
   scope of this document. That can use H.248/MEGACO, MGCP, or an 
   internal proprietary protocol.

                    Figure 1: Normal Transcoding Case 
    
   We are focused on ERROR Cases for transcoding service. If A receives 
   488(Not Acceptable Here) after trying to connect B via T, A does not 
   know which is 488(Not Acceptable Here), whether it occurred at T or 
   B. We want to know which part(T or B) an error occurred. We need an 
   additional response code to 404(Not Found), 406(Not Acceptable), 
   415(Unsupported Media Type), 500(Internal Server Error), 503(Service 
   Unavailable), and 606(Not Acceptable)[1]. These are derived from 
   several steps during call setup sequences; destination finding step, 
   media type check step, codec negotiation step, media format and 
   decoding step, etc. 
    
    
5.1 Not Acceptable at T and B for calling part A 
    
   If T and B can not support codec a, T SHOULD reply to A with a new 
   response code xx1(Not Supportable at T) after receiving 488(Not 
   Acceptable Here) from B. This new response code notifies the calling 
   party with the more detailed reason than 406(Not Acceptable). This 
   means not only 488(Not Acceptable Here) at called party B but also 
   transcoding not supportable A at T.

   from B.

   If calling party receives the xx1(Not Supportable at T), the calling 
   party will not try to connect a calling party B through T any more. 
    
    
    
6. Use Cases of Multi-transcoding 
    
    
   There are three kinds of use cases for multi-transcoding. 
    
   - one or more heterogeneous networks 
   - one or more ITSPs 
   - one or more wideband speech codecs 
                
   We can make a configuration as an example of multi-transcoding use 
   cases in Figure 4. In this convention, Capital letters mean a node 
   and lowercase(a, b, c, d, and e) means a codec.

           Figure 4: An Example of Multi-transcoding use case 
    
    
6.1 Use cases for heterogeneous networks 
    
   There are one or more heterogeneous networks[15]: enterprise networks 
   using IP-PBX, ITSP(Internet Telephony Service Provider), IMS in 
   3GPP2, PacketCable, and Wibro. They will not use a common codec. So, 
   they need multi transcoding such as; 
    
   - use case 1: A(a) - IP PBX T1(a-e, a-b) - ITSP T2(b-c, b-d) - 
                  IMS T3(a-d, d-e) - D(d) 
   - use case 2: A(a) - IP PBX T1(a-e, a-b) - ITSP T2(b-c, b-d) - 
                  PacketCable T4(c-d) - F(d) 
   - use case 3: E(e) - IMS T3(a-d, d-e) - Wibro T5(d-c) - G(c) 
                  
    
    
6.2 Use cases for ITSPs 
    
   There are one or more ITSPs[16] or SBC(Session Border Controllers) 
   because all of internet telephony subscribers will not subscribe to 
   only one ITSP. There are a lot of domestic ITSPs and international 
   ITSPs or ITXP. Internet telephony should be supported by any kind of 
   terminal vendor even though it supports a specific codec. It also

                    Multi-Transcoding Scenario            March 2006 
 
   supports multi call forwarding service. So, they need multi 
   transcoding such as; 
    
   - use case 4: C(c) - ITSP T2(c-b, b-d) - ITSP T6(b-a, b-d) - ITSP 
                  T7(a-d, d-e) - G(d) 
    
    
6.3 Use cases for wideband codecs 
    
   There are one or more wideband speech codecs. The wideband speech 
   codecs for internet telephony are being developed: AMR-WB in 3GPP, 
   VMR-WB in 3GPP2, G.729EV in ITU-T SG 16 Question 10, a wideband codec 
   in ITU-T SG 16 Question 9, AAC(Advanced Audio Coding), and 
   Speex[17,18].  
    
   A wideband codec encodes voice using 16,000 samples per second (50 ~ 
   7,000Hz), as opposed to the 8,000 samples per second (300 ~ 3,400Hz) 
   by narrowband codec. The voice quality of wideband codec is better 
   than one of narrowband codec due to supporting wider band. A tandem 
   transcoding means to encode narrowband codec such as G.711. So, it 
   makes down sampling and worsens the voice quality. If two parties 
   (calling party and called party) have two different wideband codecs, 
   transcoders should transcode a wideband codec to another wideband 
   codec without tandem transcoding. If we use a common codec with 
   G.711(tandem), there is no more need for multi-transcoding. But, we 
   need multi-transcoding for supplying a wideband speech high quality 
   to each side. 
    
   - use case 5: wideband codec to wideband codec without tandem 
                  transcoding 
    
   Multi-transcoding signaling can be useful for internet telephony 
   environments supported by this standard. Multi-trascoder can cover 
   the use case using one or more conference bridge transcoding models. 
    
    
7. Multi-transcoding Scenario 
    
   We explain scenarios in network environment with one more transcoding 
   nodes. 
    
   The transit party SHOULD provide all transcoding capability to the 
   calling party and called party during call negotiation in call set up 
   procedures. This minimizes codec mismatch call setup failure due to a 
   lack of codec negotiation information. 
    
   A discriminator for codec characteristics SHOULD provide the 
   information whether it will be transcoded or not. The discriminator

   prevents it from re-transcoding or transcoding-cycling in a multi-
   transcoding environment. 
    
   Multi-transcoding can decrease the quality of the codec, so we SHOULD 
   try to minimize the number of transcodings if it is possible. A 
   preference order among candidate codecs SHOULD send to the other side 
   according to the quality of codec. The preference is useful for codec 
   negotiation during the call set up. 
    
    
7.1 Multi-transcoding Scenario 1 
    
   The T (Transcoding intermediary node) can send to called side party 
   with its transcoding capabilities based on received calling side 
   party media.  
    
   T1 sends to T2 the codec a from A and the Tb from T1. T2 sends to T3 
   the a from A, the Tb from T1, and the Tc from T2. T3 sends to B the a 
   from A, the Tb from T1, the Tc from T2, and the Td from T3.

                 Figure 5: Multi-transcoding Scenario 1 
    
   T1 has the codec negotiation a between A and T1, Tb between T1 and 
   T2, Tc between T2 and T3, and Td between T3 and B. There are three 
   kinds of transcoding at both the signaling path and the media path 
   in this scenario. 
    
    
7.2 Multi-transcoding Scenario 2 
    
   The T (Transcoding intermediary node) can send to called side party 
   with its transcoding capabilities based on received calling side 
   party media.

                    Multi-Transcoding Scenario            March 2006 
 
   T1 sends to T2 the a from A and the Tb from T1. T2 sends to T3 the a 
   from A, the Tb from T1, and the Tc from T2. T3 sends to B the a from 
   A, the Tb from T1, the Td from T3, and the Tc from T2.  
    
   T3 has the capability which transcode directly higher priority codec 
   a to another codec Td, so codec sequence is a, Tb, Td, Tc instead of 
   a, Tb, Tc, Td. This method is useful for minimizing the number of 
   transcodings.  
    
   We assume that transcoder decreases the original media quality.

                 Figure 6: Multi-transcoding Scenario 2 
    
   T3 has the codec negotiation a between A and T3, and Td between T3 
   and B, so A to T3 media path is a and T3 to B media path is d. T1 and 
   T2 have the bypass only capability at both of signaling path and 
   media path in this scenario. 
    
 
7.3 Multi-transcoding Scenario 3 
    
   The T (Transcoding intermediary node) can send to called side party 
   with its transcoding capabilities based on received calling side 
   party media.  
    
   T1 sends to T2 the a from A and the Tb from T1. T2 sends to T3 the a 
   from A, the Tb from T1/T2, Tc from T2. T3 sends to B the a from A, 
   the Tb from T1/T2, and the Tc from T2/T3.  
    
   There are two kinds of priority decision methods. One is based on 
   first order; first order is first priority. The other is based on 
   quality; If T3 has two alternatives (one is a pair of wideband codec 
   a and narrowband codec Tb, the other is a pair of wideband codec a 
   and wideband codec Tc), so the codec sequence is a, Tc, Tb instead of

   a, Tb, Tc. We can make quality the first priority and order sequence 
   second. 
    
   We assume that wideband codec has better quality than narrowband. We 
   do not consider the performance of transcoder: T1's a-b and T2's a-b 
   or T2's a-c and T3's a-c.

                 Figure 7: Multi-transcoding Scenario 3 
    
   T3 has the codec negotiation a between A and T3, and Tc between T3 
   and B, so A to T3 media path is a and T3 to B media path is c. T1 and 
   T2 have the bypass only capability at both signaling path and media 
   path in this scenario. 
    
    
   These scenarios effect Transcoding-cycling avoidance, minimizing of 
   transcoding, call setup delay, and call waiting states during call 
   set up. 
    
    
8. The Maximum Tn of Multi-transcoding 
    
   We have to define the maximum number Tn of multi-transcodings. The 
   quality will be decreased according to increase in the number of 
   transcodings. We SHOULD consider defining the maximum Tn to avoid 
   quality deterioration and complex interoperability.

   The defining of maximum number Tn is for further study. This number 
   will be smaller than Max-Forwards in SIP Extension for Instant 
   Messaging[12].
