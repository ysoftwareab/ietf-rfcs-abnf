Abstract

     This document specifies a generic DNS resource record format for
     "direct authentication" of DSNKEY records with the SEP bit (Secure
     Entry Point) set to "1". Although a generic record format is
     specified with type fields allowing standardized or proprietary

     extensions, the only use of SDDA RR in DNSSEC operations is the
     support of trust anchor key management operations. Schemes using
     the SDDA-RR format are to be specified in other documents.

1. Introduction

     The SEP DNSSEC Direct Authenticator Resource Record (SDDA RR)
     provides a generic RR format for authentication mechanisms
     applicable to DNSKEY records with the SEP bit set. It is intended
     to fulfill the need of trust anchor key management, notably
     automated trust anchor key rollover. Typically, this is done using
     cryptographic mechanisms outside of the DNSSEC core specifications.

     Zero or more SDDA records may occur in a zone for a DNSKEY record 
     with the SEP bit, each using a different combination of algorithms
     and security context. An SDDA record provides additional
     information about the DNSKEY. This information may assist resolvers
     and/or parent zones in authenticating the DNSKEY record contents.

     Authentication mechanisms used with SDDA records are expected to
     require and/or exploit outside arrangements, e.g. authentication
     key establishment or a pre-existing security association.

2. Resource Record Specifications

2.1 General Characteristics

     The Type value for the SDDA RR type is [[to be determined]].

     The DNSKEY RR is class independent.

     The DNSKEY RR has no special TTL requirements.

2.2 SDDA RR Wire Format

     The RDATA for an SDDA record consists of a 2 octet key tag field,
     four 1 octet type fields, and a number of other fields as implied,
     directly or indirectly, by the type indications. The type fields
     are respectively for
       o  an algorithm type field,
       o  a digest type field,
       o  an authentication mechanism type field,
       o  an authentication context type field.

Moreau                      Standards Track                    [page 3]

Internet-Draft                  SDDA-RR                   October, 2005
     Among the other fields, an SDDA record encoding comprises a digest
     field. The DS RR record specifications from [RFC4034], section 5.1,
     mostly apply to the key tag field, the algorithm type field, the
     digest type field, and the digest field (i.e. if a provision in the
     present document relates to these fields and may be subject to more
     than one interpretation, an interpretation compatible with
     [RFC4034] shall prevail).

     It is not expected that a decoding software be able to parse the
     variable-length fields unless it is fully compliant with the set of
     type indication values.

     The SDDA RR fields are listed in the table below in their order in
     the SDDA RR wire encoding. Some fields are optional and/or can be
     repeated. The group of three fields starting with Authentication
     Algorithm in section 2.2.10 may be repeated more than once. The
     Authentication Mechanism Data value lies at the end of SDDA RR wire
     encoding, it may comprise zero, one, or more fields (e.g. a DSA
     signature value is two integers). An SDDA record points to a DNSKEY
     record using the fields NAME, Key Tag, Algorithm, Digest Type,
     optionally Digest Type Extension, and Digest.

2.2.10.3  Authentication Algorithm Common Parameters,

                    Zero or more occurrences based on Authentication
                    Mechanism Type and any Authentication Algorithm Type

2.2.1 The Key Tag Field

     The Key Tag field lists the key tag of the DNSKEY RR referred to by
     the SDDA record, in network byte order.

     The Key Tag used by the SDDA RR is as specified in Appendix B of
     [RFC4034].

2.2.2 The Algorithm Field

     The Algorithm field lists the algorithm number of the DNSKEY RR
     referred to by the SDDA record.

     The algorithm number used by the SDDA RR is identical to the
     algorithm number used by DNSKEY RRs. Appendix A.1 in [RFC4034]
     lists the algorithm number types.

2.2.3 The Digest Type Field

     The SDDA RR refers to a DNSKEY RR by including a digest of that
     DNSKEY RR.  The Digest Type field identifies the algorithm used to
     construct the digest. Appendix A.2 in [RFC4034] lists the possible
     digest algorithm types.

     In the event that private digest types become allowed in DS records

Moreau                      Standards Track                    [page 5]

Internet-Draft                  SDDA-RR                   October, 2005
     using an extension mechanism (e.g. similar to the private algorithm
     support in DNSKEY private algorithms PRIVATEDNS and PRIVATEOID),
     the Digest Type Extension optional field is specified in section
     2.2.6.

2.2.4 The Authentication Mechanism Type Field

     The SDDA RR provides authentication information for a DNSKEY RR
     according to an authentication mechanism. The Authentication
     Mechanism type field identifies the specific mechanism applicable
     to the SDDA record, and partly determines the format of the RDATA
     variable part after the digest field.

     The currently allocated authentication mechanisms are
     0:   reserved,
     1:   TAKREM key rollover message authentication defined in
          reference [TAKREM-DNSSEC],
     253: Private mechanism identified by a domain-name-encoded
          extension field, see section 2.2.7,
     254: Private mechanism identified by an ISO Object Identifier
          extension field, see section 2.2.7.

     Mechanism numbers 253 and 254 are reserved for private use and
     neither will be assigned to a specific mechanism. Private
     mechanisms use the Authentication Mechanism Type Extension optional
     field specified in section 2.2.7.

2.2.5 The Authentication Context Type Field

     Some authentication mechanism may need a reference to previously
     established parameters, e.g. a security association or a simple
     symmetric secret key. In cases where the Name field of the SDDA
     record does not provide sufficient context indication, a non-zero
     value in the Authentication Context Type field tells the format of
     reference information found in the Authentication Context Data
     field. The semantic rules of Authentication Context Data field
     should be specified with any authentication mechanisms that use a
     given format.



Moreau                      Standards Track                    [page 6]

Internet-Draft                  SDDA-RR                   October, 2005
     The currently allocated authentication context types are
     0:   none, i.e. the domain name provides adequate context
          information;
     1:   a DNS name (not compressed) is present in the Authentication
          Context Data field;
     2:   an opaque 32 bits value (encoded in network order) is present
          in the Authentication Context Data field.

2.2.6 The Digest Type Extension Field

     The Digest Type Extension optional field is specified in
     anticipation that private digest types may me allowed in the
     future. In this case, the present extension field should be used as
     a placeholder for a variable-length private digest type indication.
     In the meantime, this optional field is not used.

2.2.7 The Authentication Mechanism Type Extension Field

     When the Authentication Mechanism Type field value implies the
     presence of the present extension field, this subsection
     specification applies.

     If the Authentication Mechanism Type field value is 253, the
     present extension field contains a wire encoded domain name, which
     must not be compressed. The domain name indicates the private
     mechanism to use.  Entities should only use domain names they
     control to designate their private mechanisms.

     If the Authentication Mechanism Type field value is 254, the
     present extension field contains an unsigned length byte followed
     by a BER encoded Object Identifier (ISO OID) of that length.  The
     OID indicates the private mechanism to use. Entities should only
     use OIDs they control to designate their private mechanisms.

2.2.8 The Digest Field

     The SDDA RR refers to a DNSKEY RR by including a digest of that
     DNSKEY RR, exactly like a DS record does, see section 5.1.4 in
     [RFC4034]. The Digest Type field (perhaps with the Digest Type
     Extension field) identifies the algorithm used to construct the
     digest. The length and contents of this field is dependent on this
     digest algorithm.

Internet-Draft                  SDDA-RR                   October, 2005

2.2.9 The Authentication Context Data Field

     The Authentication Context Data field contains the security context
     identification data in a format identified by the Authentication
     Context Type field. This field is present if a non-zero value is
     present in the Authentication Context Type field. An authentication
     mechanism may need this information in an SDDA RR instance for a
     complete reference to previously established security parameters.

2.2.10 Algorithm-Related Fields

     A given authentication mechanism may rely on one or more
     cryptography algorithms, e.g. a digital signature mechanism may use
     two such algorithms: a cryptographic hash function and a public key
     primitive. For each cryptographic algorithm, a set of
     algorithm-related fields may be present. This allows the selection
     of a specific algorithm among a family of alternatives, and/or the
     specification of common parameters applicable to an algorithm
     instance. The presence of one or more sets is implicitly specified
     by the Authentication Mechanism Type indication in an SDDA RR, as
     are the algorithm-specific field contents and semantic.

     A set of algorithm-related fields comprises at least the
     Authentication Algorithm Type field described in section 2.2.10.1,
     optionally the Authentication Algorithm Type Extension field
     described in section 2.2.10.2, and optionally the Authentication
     Algorithm Common Parameters field described in section 2.2.10.3.
     When more than one algorithm deserve some algorithm-related fields,
     they should appear by groups, e.g. Authentication Algorithm Type,
     Authentication Algorithm Type Extension, and Authentication
     Algorithm Common Parameters for a first algorithm, then these three
     fields for the next algorithm.

2.2.10.1 The Authentication Algorithm Type Field

     The Authentication Algorithm Type field is optional and significant
     in the context of the Authentication Mechanism field value of a
     given SDDA RR encoding. This should be a one-octet field. The
     mechanism-specific allocation of algorithm type values may make use
     of the Authentication Algorithm Type Extension field for private
     algorithms.

Internet-Draft                  SDDA-RR                   October, 2005
2.2.10.2 The Authentication Algorithm Type Extension Field

     The Authentication Algorithm Type Extension field allows private
     algorithms to be specified in the Authentication Algorithm Type
     field, as may be specified for a given authentication mechanism.

2.2.10.3 The Authentication Algorithm Common Parameters Field

     Some cryptographic algorithm require the specification of common
     parameters, e.g. the Diffie-Hellman cryptosystem, other algorithms
     based on the discrete logarithm problem and elliptic curve
     cryptographic algorithms. The Authentication Algorithm Common
     Parameters field allows the specification of these parameters,
     using algorithm-specific rules. These rules may specify the common
     parameter values directly or by reference to values published
     elsewhere (e.g the United States NIST organization publishes
     elliptic curve parameters).

2.2.11 The Authentication Mechanism Data Field

     The Authentication Mechanism Data field contains the "payload" data
     relevant to the authentication mechanism applied to the DNSKEY RR
     linked to the SDDA RR. The rules applicable to this data field are
     governed by the authentication mechanism and any authentication
     algorithm specified in the previous fields of this SDDA RR.

2.3 The SDDA RR Presentation Format

     The presentation format of the RDATA portion is as follows:

     The Key Tag field MUST be represented as an unsigned decimal
     integer.

     The Algorithm field MUST be represented either as an unsigned
     decimal integer or as an algorithm mnemonic as specified in
     Appendix A.1 of [RFC4034].

     The Digest Type field MUST be represented as an unsigned decimal
     integer.

     The Authentication Mechanism Type MUST be represented as an
     unsigned decimal integer.

Moreau                      Standards Track                    [page 9]

Internet-Draft                  SDDA-RR                   October, 2005

     The Authentication Context Type MUST be represented as an unsigned
     decimal integer.

     The remaining portion of the RDATA field must be represented as a
     Base64 encoding of its contents. Whitespace is allowed within the
     Base64 text. For a definition of Base64 encoding, see [RFC3548].

3. Impact on DNSSEC Core Specifications

3.1 Impact on [RFC4033] Specifications

     In [RFC4033], section 3, second paragraph, the present document
     adds a DNSSEC resource record type for the SDDA RR (in addition to
     RRSIG, DNSKEY, DS, and NSEC).

     In [RFC4033], section 3.1, at the end of the before last paragraph
     (where typical DNSSEC authentication chains are introduced), the
     following text should be added:
          The SDDA record type allows optional authentication of a trust
          anchor key when a resolver explicitly requests it (i.e. there
          is no automatic inclusion of an SDDA RR when target DNSKEY
          with the SEP bit set is included in a reply). A resolver would
          typically query SDDA RR when a) it is DNSSEC-aware, b) it
          encountered a DNSKEY with the SEP bit set for which it is not
          currently configured with an acceptable level of trust, and c)
          it supports one or more SDDA authentication mechanism.

     In [RFC4033], section 8, first sentence, the SDDA resource record
     type should be added to the enumeration of RRSIG, DNSKEY, DS, and
     NSEC.

     In [RFC4033], section 9, end of first paragraph (about the name
     server including RRSIG records et al. in the additional data of
     responses), the following text should be added:
          A name server SHOULD NOT include SDDA records in a response
          unless explicitly requested in a query.

     In [RFC4033], section 10, the present document should be included
     in the "DNSSEC protocol document set".

Internet-Draft                  SDDA-RR                   October, 2005
3.2 Impact on [RFC4034] Specifications

     In [RFC4034], the SDDA resource record type should be mentioned in
     the abstract and the introduction.

     In [RFC4034], section 2.1.1, second paragraph, the following text
     should be added after the second sentence (where the DNSKEY SEP bit
     is reported to have no special meaning for resolvers):
          The introduction of SDDA RR scheme creates an exception to
          this rule justified by the stated goal of support for
          automated trust anchor key rollover. If it is to be automated,
          such a rollover has to be triggered by a resolver encountering
          a previously unknown DNSKEY with the SEP bit with some
          expectation that a supported SDDA RR might target this DNSKEY.
          This fully complies with the original intent of the SEP bit as
          set forth in [RFC3757].

     In the [RFC4034] section 7 on IANA considerations, it might be
     mentioned that DNSSEC algorithm numbers and digest types are used
     in the present specification.

3.3 Impact on [RFC4035] Specifications

     In [RFC4035], section 2.1, second paragraph (no secure entry point
     DNSKEY required for islands of security), the following text should
     be added:
          A DNSKEY RR acting as a secure entry point is also required if
          using an SDDA scheme for trust anchor key management.

     In [RFC4035], no change is required to section 2.2 as the general
     rule for including RRSIG signatures to RRsets apply to the SDDA
     RRset which may be present in a zone apex.

     In [RFC4035], no change is required to section 4.2 as the mandatory
     provisions for DS record validation are not reduced by the
     existence of a supported SDDA scheme for the same DNSKEY targeted
     by the DS record.

     In [RFC4035], end of section 4.5 (Configured Trust Anchors), there
     should be a mention that SDDA schemes can assist trust anchor key
     management.

     In [RFC4035], section 5.1 (Special Considerations for Islands of
     Security), there should be a mention that SDDA schemes can assist
     configuration management for islands of security.

     In [RFC4035], end of section 5.3.1 (stating the DNSKEY RR
     authentication requirements for DNS response processing), a third
     option should be added:
            o  the DNSKEY RR has the SEP bit set and the validator
               supports at least one SDDA scheme, retrieves the SDDA
               RRset from the same zone apex as the DNSKEY, and
               validates one of the SDDA RR targeting the DNSKEY RR
               following the rules of a supported SDDA scheme.

4. Security Considerations

     The present document specifies a DNS record format for
     authentication mechanisms that should rely on end-to-end
     cryptographic means for providing security services, i.e. trust
     anchor key authentication. The DNS as a transport mechanism for
     security-relevant information should be considered as an insecure
     transmission mechanism.

     Notably the digital signature present in a RRSIG record covering
     the SDDA RRset should not be trusted blindly (actually, if there is
     a reason to trust the signature of the SDDA RRset, there is almost
     certainly no justification to use an SDDA scheme in the first
     place).

5. IANA Considerations

     For the present DNS record type format specification to become
     effective, IANA would be requested to assign a DNS type code to the
     SDDA resource record from the Specification Required portion of the
     DNS Resource Record Type registry.

     If evolved into a recognized standard, the present document creates
     two "name spaces" ([RFC2434]) of relevance to IANA: the SDDA record
     Authentication Mechanism Type and the SDDA record Authentication
     Context Type. Other name spaces in the present document are either
     already covered by provisions of existing standards (Algorithm and
     Digest Type from [RFC4034]) or delegated to the specification for
     an authentication mechanism (Authentication Algorithm Type).
