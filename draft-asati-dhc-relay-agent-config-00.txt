Internet-Draft  DHCP Relay Agent Configuration Option    September 2010

1. Introduction

   There are scenarios in which a network operator (Service Provider or
   Enterprise) may desire the relay agent to be dynamically provisioned
   while facilitating the server-client communication to ultimately
   facilitate the service activation in a zero-touch manner.

     One example is the provisioning of the Provider Edge (PE) router,
     acting as the relay agent for the Customer Edge (CE) router,
     acting as the (DHCP) client, during IP/VPN [RFC4364] service
     activation.

   DHCP [RFC2131][ RFC3315] is the predominant signaling protocol to
   dynamically assign IP addresses and other TCP/IP configuration
   parameters to routers and hosts. DHCP Relay Agent functionality
   [RFC3046] is specified to facilitate the forwarding of DHCP messages
   between the client and server through the relay agent.

   DHCP server may use one or more sub-options within the "Relay Agent
   Information" option [RFC3046] appended by Relay Agent, for IP
   address and other parameter assignment policies to the Client. The
   "Relay Agent Information" option [RFC3046] is limited to providing
   the additional information from Relay Agent to the DHCP server to
   aid the server.

   This document proposes a new DHCP option (and sub-options) that the
   Relay Agent can use to request and receive the desired Relay Agent
   configuration information and that the DHCP server can use to
   deliver the requested configuration information. The document also
   describes the associated procedures and operations for the Relay
   Agent and Server to achieve the auto-provisioning of VPN information
   at the PE router acting as the relay agent.



2. Key Words to Reflect Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].  RFC 2119 defines the use of these key words to help make
   the intent of standards track documents as clear as possible.  While
   this document uses these keywords, this document is not a standards
   track document.

   Additionally, this document freely uses the terms that are defined
   in [RFC2131][RFC2132][RFC3046].

3. Problem / Requirement

   There are other methods to activate the VPN service by auto-
   provisioning the CE router after it establishes the layer2
   connectivity. However, this assumes and requires the adjacent PE
   router to be provisioned in advance to ensure that the CE gets the
   IP reachability through the PE router, and is able to participate in
   the any-to-any VPN such as BGP IP/VPN [RFC4364]. This is one of the
   key challenges that serve as one of the requirements for the
   solution prescribed in this document. Another requirement is to make
   use of the existing signaling protocol(s) and not impose multiple
   protocols to achieve this.



4. Relay Agent Configuration Option

   This document defines a new DHCP Option called the Relay Agent
   Configuration Option.  It is a "container" option for specific sub-
   options.  The format of the Relay Agent Configuration option is:



             Code   Len     Agent Configuration Field
            +------+------+------+------+------+------+--...-+------+
            |  TBD |   N  |  c1  |  c2  |  c3  |  c4  |      |  cN  |
            +------+------+------+------+------+------+--...-+------+

                Figure 1 Relay Agent Configuration Option



   Code  = DHCP Option for Relay Agent Configuration (to be allocated
   by IANA)

   Len   = Total number of octets (N) in the Agent Configuration Field
   (inclusive of all sub-options)

   Agent Configuration Field  = One or more Sub-options, each encoded
   as a SubOpt/Length/Value tuple, as shown below:

            |  1   |   N' |                                         |
            +------+------+------------------------------...--------+

              Figure 2 Relay Agent Configuration Sub-Option

   SubOpt            = DHCP Sub-Option for Relay Agent Configuration
   (to be allocated by IANA)

   Len               = Total number of octets (N') in a Sub-option

   Sub-option Value  = zero or more octets to encode the value.



   The sub-options need not appear in any particular order.



5. Operation



5.1. DHCP Relay Agent Procedures

   The relay agent adds the DHCP relay agent configuration option (&
   needed sub-options) in the relayed message to request the relay
   agent side configuration information from the server.

   The addition of this option SHOULD be configurable, and SHOULD be
   disabled by default.  Relay agents SHOULD have separate
   configurables for each sub-option to control whether it is added to
   client-to-server packets.

   A relay agent adding a Relay Agent Configuration Information Option
   MUST add it as the last option (but before 'End Option' 255, if
   present) or the second last option, if option 82 is present, in the
   DHCP options field of any recognized BOOTP or DHCP packet forwarded
   from a client to a server.

   If the configuration information, provided by the DHCP server in its
   response, is already present at the relay agent, then relay agent
   SHOULD compare the existing configuration with the new one, and in
   case of a mismatch, logs an error/event.

Internet-Draft  DHCP Relay Agent Configuration Option    September 2010

   The relay agent MUST remove the relay agent configuration option
   from the DHCP response and forward the remaining response to the
   client.

   The operation of relay agent for specific sub-options should be
   specified with that sub-option.



5.1.1. DHCP Relay Agent Chaining

   Relay agents receiving a DHCP packet from an untrusted circuit with
   giaddr set to zero (indicating that they are the first-hop router)
   but with a Relay Agent Configuration option already present in the
   packet SHALL discard the packet and increment an error count.

   A trusted circuit may contain a trusted downstream (closer to
   client) network element (bridge) between the relay agent and the
   client that MAY add a relay agent option but not set the giaddr
   field.  In this case, the relay agent does NOT add a "second" relay
   agent option, but forwards the DHCP packet per normal DHCP relay
   agent operations, setting the giaddr field as it deems appropriate.

   The mechanisms for distinguishing between "trusted" and "untrusted"
   circuits are specific to the type of circuit termination equipment,
   and may involve local administration.



5.2. DHCP Server Procedures

   The DHCP server examines the DHCP options in the incoming request,
   and constructs the response. The DHCP server may poll any other
   servers present in the OSS/BSS to construct the requested
   configuration information, and ultimately include it in the relay
   agent configuration option/sub-options of DHCP response.



5.3. DHCP Client Procedures

   This document doesn't specify any changes to the client functioning.

   The new option defined in this document is never passed to the
   client.

APPENDIX A: Applicability

A.1. Applicability to MPLS IP/VPN

   Figure 3 below illustrates a sample MPLS/VPN network topology in
   which CE1, CE2 and CE3 are part of the same Virtual Private Network
   (VPN), which is represented by VRF VPN1, say, in the MPLS/VPN
   network.



   CE1-------PE1-------MPLS/VPN Network-------PE2-----CE2
                           |         \--------PE3-----CE3
                           |
                          PE10
                           |
                     Network/Service Management Complex
                  (DHCP Server, DNS Server, TFTP Server, etc.)

                    Figure 3 A Sample Network Topology



   The "Network/Service Management Complex" is where the DHCP Server,
   DNS server, TFTP server etc. may reside.

   The PE router is assumed to have the DHCP relay agent functionality
   as suggested in this document. The relay agent functionality may be
   included globally for all PE-CE interfaces or selectively on
   individual PE-CE interfaces.

   Optionally, the unused PE-CE interfaces at the PE router may be
   assigned to a default VRF prior to the successful DHCP processing
   and auto-configuration. This helps to avoid having the CE get the
   global reachability by accident prior to the DHCP operation
   completion.

   Assuming that the PE-CE interface is ready for the layer1/layer2
   connectivity, CE would (be programmed to) broadcast the DHCP request
   when the layer2 connectivity is established on either all or
   designated port(s).

     . This ensures that the DHCP request reaches the PE router.
     . The DHCP request may include CE's unique identifier (such as
        MAC address or S/N or Unique Device Identifier (UDI) etc.) that
        is already known to the Servers in the Network/Service
        Management Complex.

   PE router upon receiving the DHCP request on a layer2 interface that
   isn't configured with any IP address, relays it to the DHCP server
   that may be pre-provisioned.

   PE adds the DHCP relay agent configuration option (& needed sub-
   options) in the relayed message to request the PE side configuration
   information.

   The DHCP server examines the DHCP options in the incoming request,
   and constructs the response. The DHCP server may poll any other
   servers present in the OSS/BSS for the PE configuration information,
   so as to include it in the options/sub-options of DHCP response.

   The PE configuration information, in RFC4364 environment, may
   contain one or more of the following -
    - IP address and subnet for PE-CE interface
    - VRF Configuration (RD, RT etc.)
    - Other PE-CE Interface configuration (description, vrf mapping
   etc.)
    - Selected Routing Protocol instance (for the CE)
    - Neighbor and ASN information in case of BGP or EIGRP
    - Security, QoS information etc. (for the CE)


   If the VRF configuration, provided by the DHCP server in its
   response, is already present at the PE router, then PE router must
   compare the existing config with the new one, and logs an
   error/event that could be sent to the DHCP server or to the OSS/BSS
   or both, in case of a mismatch.

   PE should accept the new config. The error/event log will help to
   get the operator attention for further validation.  New DHCP sub-
   option is defined for this purpose.

   The PE router removes the PE specific information (the new DHCP
   relay agent configuration option) from the DHCP response and forward
   the remaining response to the CE router, which will process it as
   usual (not impacted by this document).
