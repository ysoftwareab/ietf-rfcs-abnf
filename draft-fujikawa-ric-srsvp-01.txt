   This draft describes Simple Resource ReSerVation Protocol (SRSVP),
   which implements multicasting, resource reservation and charging in
   the Internet.


1. Introduction

   Simple Resource ReSerVation Protocol (SRSVP) is an extension of
   Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) [RSVP], and the purposes of it is
   as follows:
     * Multicasting
     * Resource reservation
     * Charging

INTERNET DRAFT                    SRSVP                        March 2001


   SRSVP creates multicast flows and resource-reserved flows (QoS flows).
   The state of a QoS flow is hard-state.

   SRSVP implements both of unicast and multicast resource reservations
   by a method of receiver-initiated resource reservation.

  1.1 Specification of QoS

   Quality of Services (QoSes) specified by hosts are defined in [SS].

  1.2 Terminology

   Flow
          A flow is a unit of resource reservation. There are two type of
          flows, a uni-source flow and a multi-source flow.

   Uni-source flow
          A flow is identified by protocol number, source address, source
          port, destination address, and destination port. Currently, a
          flow is regarded as a uni-source flow when the destination
          address of its session is unicast.

   Multi-source flow
          A flow is identified by protocol number, destination address,
          and destination port. Currently, a flow is regarded as a
          multi-source one when the destination address of its session is
          multicast.

   Rendezvous Point (RVP)
          A sender which forwards data in the case of a multi-source
          flow. It is generally an application gateway, and does not have
          to be a router.

   State of a flow
          State of a flow that a router manages. This includes incoming
          interfaces of Resv/Path and outgoing interfaces of Resv/Path.

   Routing Entry
          The information for forwarding a packet which incomes from a
          certain interface to a defined interface. An entry of a routing
          table.

   Area Information
          A router advertises information of addresses and charging as
          area information. Area information is global. See [HQLIP] for
          details.

   Link Information

INTERNET DRAFT                    SRSVP                        March 2001


          A link links an area to another area. A router advertises a
          metric and QoS parameters of bandwidth and delay as link
          information. Link information is global. There are two types of
          link information, external link information and internal link
          information. See [HQLIP] for details.

   Service Spec (Sspec)
          Specification of traffic that sender and receiver specify. A
          resource reservation is not established when two Sspec's of
          them match.

   Path QoS (PQ)
          A PQ shows link information at a link from the viewpoint of a
          reservation when the reservation is established. Assuming that
          a link of 10Kpps/50msec exists, a reservation is 3Kpps/50msec,
          and the link advertises 8Kpps/100msec as a result. In this
          case, the PQ shows 10Kpps/50msec is available. A PQ is local
          for each reservation.

   First Aggregated QoS (FAQ)
          Receivers and en-route routers may not get information around a
          sender or an RVP. A FAQ is a set of calculated QoSes from a
          sender or an RVP to centers of the areas containing it, and is
          sent to the receivers and en-route routers. A FAQ is local for
          each reservation.

   Policy
          A policy defined in SRSVP is for charging, and specifies for
          which areas a sender should pay according to a certain
          reservation.


2. Multicast Model

   The multicast model of SRSVP is based on RVP like PIM-SM. However, an
   RVP is generally an application gateway, and does not have to be a
   router. Distinguishable reservations (flows) are established, between
   a sender and an RVP, and between an RVP and receivers. A sender can be
   an RVP. Each sender sends multicast data to an RVP by unicasting. Each
   receiver joins a multicast group, and a tree rooted from an RVP is
   created as a result. A receiver is a leaf in the tree. Multicast data
   received at an RVP is forwarded along the created tree.

   RVP is described as ``sender'' in the case of a reservation between
   sender(s) and an RVP, and is described as ``receiver'' in the case of
   a reservation between an RVP and receiver(s), in this paper.

3. Messages

   The following six messages are used in SRSVP:
     * KeepALive Message
     * Resv Message
     * PathTear Message
     * ResvTear Message
     * PathChg Message
     * ResvChg Message

   SRSVP messages in BNF notation are shown as follows:

    KeepAlive = Header
    Path      = Header Dst Src Sspec Label Policy PQ FAQ [ Ref ]
    Resv      = Header Dst Src [ Sspec Label Policy PQ FAQ ]
    PathTear  = Header Dst Src [ Err ]
    ResvTear  = Header Dst Src [ Err ]
    PathChg   = Header Dst Src Ref Chg
    ResvChg   = Header Dst Src Ref Chg

   Dst
          Indicates protocol number, destination address and destination
          port.

   Src
          Indicates source address and source port. When Dst is a
          multicast address, Src can have multiple pairs of source
          address and source port.

   Sspec
          Service Specification

   Label
          A label used between adjacent nodes.

   Policy
          Indicates region where a sender is charged.

   PQ
          PQ.

   FAQ
          FAQ.

   Ref
          In order to distinguish charge information of each flow. a
          router, which requiring charging and is the nearest to a
          sender, attaches Ref to a Path message.

INTERNET DRAFT                    SRSVP                        March 2001



   Chg
          Indicates the total sum of charge.

   Err
          Error code.

  3.1 KeepAlive Message

   A KeepAlive message is used for maintaining TCP connection.

  3.2 Path Message

   A Path message MUST include a session, a sender template, Sspec and
   MAY include FAQ, PQ and policy if needed. A Path is sent from a sender
   in response to a Resv message. A request from a receiver, i.e. a Resv
   message, is restricted by a Path message.

  3.3 Resv Message

   There are two types of Resv messages. One is for obtaining Sspec, FAQ,
   PQ and policy, and the other is for actually requesting for a resource
   reservation. The former is called as Resv0 and the latter is called as
   Resv1. Resv0 MUST include session and sender template(s). Resv1 MUST
   include session, sender template(s) and Sspec, and MAY include FAQ and
   PQ. A Resv message is sent from a receiver.

  3.4 PathTear/ResvTear Message

   A PathTear message, which a sender or an RVP sends, and a ResvTear
   message, which a receiver sends, tear down a resource reservation and
   notify an error. A sender, an RVP or a receiver explicitly tear down a
   reservation by a PathTear/ResvTear message, while a sender, an RVP, a
   receiver or an en-route router tear down a reservation by a
   PathTear/ResvTear message with an error code. A PathTear/ResvTear MUST
   include session and sender template(s), and MAY include an object that
   indicates an error when the error occurs.

   Types of error objects are as follows:

   Unreachable Host (UH)
          Cannot reach a host

   Unavailable Bandwidth (UB)
          The bandwidth is unavailable

   Unsatisfying Delay (UD)
          The delay does not satisfy a request

INTERNET DRAFT                    SRSVP                        March 2001



   Unsatisfying Charge (UC)
          The charge does not satisfy a request

   Illegal Sspec (IS)
          The Sspec is illegal.

   Invalid Policy (IP)
          The policy is invalid.

  3.5 PathChg/ResvChg

   A PathChg and a ResvChg conveys charging information for a flow, and
   are transfered from a side of a sender to receivers, and from sides of
   receivers to a sender, respectively.


4. Basic Procedure of Making a Resource Reservation

   The following shows an abstract of a procedure of making a resource
   reservation.

  4.1 Abstract of Resource Reservation Procedure

    1. A receiver sends a Resv message without a Sspec, i.e. Resv0.
       En-route routers forwards it along the way to a sender, and
       memorize a state of the flow.
    2. A sender that received a Resv0 sends a Path message. It is
       forwarded along the reverse path of Resv0, with being added FAQ
       and PQs. Each router releases the state of the flow after
       forwarding the Path.
    3. The receiver that received the Path sends a Resv message (Resv1)
       with the received Sspec/Policy/FAQ/PQ. Each of the receiver and
       en-route routers calculates a QoS path from a sender to itself,
       and forwards Resv1 along the reverse path of that path, with
       memorizing a state of the flow.
    4. The sender that received the Resv1 sends a Path message. It is
       forwarded along the reverse path of Resv1, with being added FAQ
       and PQs. Each of the sender and en-route routers adds an entry of
       the flow, while sending/forwarding the Path.

  4.2 Differences between Uni-source Flow and Multi-source Flow

     * Source address and port are considered for identifying a
       uni-source flow, while they are not for a multi-source flow.
     * Source address and port are included in an entry for uni-source
       flow, while they are not for a multi-source flow.
     * A node looks up a correct Src (RVP), when it receives multiple

INTERNET DRAFT                    SRSVP                        March 2001


       Resv messages each of which indicates a different source, in the
       case of a reservation for a multi-source flow.

  4.3 Valid Period of Resv

   Though a router memorizes a state of the flow when it receives the
   flow, it deletes the state unless it receives a corresponding Path
   within 30 seconds from the reception of the Resv.

  4.4 Merging Resv Messages

   A router postpones the process of a Resv until it receives a Path,
   when it has already received a Resv for the same flow.

   It forwards a Path message to each direction it has received one of
   the Resv message, or sends a PathTear message when the Sspec of the
   Resv does not correspond to the Sspec of the Path, when it received
   the Path.

   These procedures mean merging reservations.

  4.5 Restriction of Reservation by Sender

   A Resv from a receiver is restricted by a Path of a sender. That is, a
   sender adds restriction to a reservation. Receivers obeys the
   restriction.

    4.5.1 Resv1 Received before Setting Up Reservation

   A router absolutely trusts Sspec/FAQ/PQ in a Resv and proceeds the
   reservation, when it receives the Resv before setting up the
   reservation.

    4.5.2 Resv1 Received after Setting Up Reservation

   Assuming that a reservation for the flow is already established when a
   router receives Resv1.

     * In the case that the Sspec of the Resv is the same as the Sspec of
       the Path, the FAQ of the Resv includes that of the Path, and the
       PQ of the Resv includes that of the Path:
       The router forwards the Resv1 to the upstream node, which has
       already established the reservation, as long as the router has not
       sent a Resv to the upstream node.
     * In the case that the Sspec of the Resv is different from the Sspec
       of the Path:
       The router forwards the Resv0 to the upstream node, which has
       already established the reservation, as long as the router has not

       sent a Resv to the upstream node. The router re-receives a Path
       and compares the Sspec to the Sspec of the Path. The resulting
       difference means an error.
     * In the case that the FAQ of the Resv does not include that of the
       Path, or the PQ of the Resv does not include that of the Path:
       The router forwards the Resv0 to the upstream node, which has
       already established the reservation, as long as the router has not
       sent a Resv to the upstream node. The router re-receives a Path
       and proceeds the Resv1 with FAQ/PQ in the Path.


5. Examples of Reservations

   The following shows an example of creating a multicast tree. See
   appendix C for more complicated examples.

  5.1 Notation

   Notation is as follows:

   L(bw=<bandwidth>,dly=<delay>):
          Link information.

   A(chg=<charge>):
          Area information.

   P(req=<request type>,bw=<bandwidth>,PQ(...),...):
          Path message.

   R(req=<request type>,bw=<bandwidth>,PQ(...),...):
          Resv message.

   PQ(<link>,bw=<bandwidth>):
          PQ.

   PT(err=<error type>):
          PathTear message.

   RT(err=<error type>):
          ResvTear message.

   where:

   bw=<bandwidth>:
          Bandwidth available at a link or requested by a Resv.

   dly=<delay>:
          Transmission delay at each link.

   chg=<charge>:
          Charge when a reservation is established.

   req=<request type>:
          This specifies a condition for calculating the shortest path
          tree. This is included in a Sspec or a Sspec. See [SS] for
          details.

   <link>:
          A link, which is written as A1->A2.

   err=<error type>
          A type of errors. Illegal Sspec (IF) and Unreachable Host (UH)
          are used here.

   Note that a ``+'' in a message means succeeds contents of the previous
   message.

  5.2 Initial State

   Consider a network in Figure C.2.1.

   Assuming that bandwidth or delay at each link is the same as that of
   the opposite direction for simplicity, though each of them is
   different from the opposite directions originally. Charging for
   passing an area is just defined for simplicity, though charging is
   based on both of incoming direction and outgoing direction originally.

  5.3 Reservation of Uni-source Flow

    5.3.1 Reservation of S1->P1

   Consider that RVP P1 makes a reservation of S1->P1. This reservation
   is one for a uni-source flow.

   First, P1 sends Resv0, and each router forwards it along the unicast
   path towards a sender S1. Each node memorizes the state of the flow at
   this time.

                       Figure C.3.1: P1->S1 Resv0

   S1 sends a Path towards the direction from which it has received a
   Resv, and each router forwards the Path along the reverse path of
   Resv0. (Figure C.3.2) The state of the flow is deleted after the Path
   was sent/forwarded.

   A FAQ is actually included, but is omitted here.

   P1 sends a Resv1 with a Sspec same as the Sspec included in the Path.
   Each router calculates a QoS path from S1 to itself, and forwards the
   Resv1 along the path reversely. (Figure C.3.3) Each router memorizes a
   state of the flow.

   A Path is forwarded along the reverse path of Resv1. As each router
   adds an entry, the reservation is established. The Path includes PQs.

6. TCP Connections for Exchanging Messages

   The way to establish TCP connections for exchanging SRSVP messages.

   The port number of XXXX is used for TCP connections. Each node
   searches adjacent nodes from link information of HQLIP, and establish
   a TCP connection to each of them. The direction of a TCP connection is
   decided by the way described in [HQLIP].

   A node tear down reservations related to the connection, when the
   connection is cut off.

A. Message Formats

  A.1 Header

     +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
     |            Length             |     Type      |     Flags     |
     +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+

   Length: 16bits
          The total length of message including the header (byte).

   Type: 8 bits
          0 = KeepAlive
          1 = Path
          2 = Resv
          5 = PathTear
          6 = ResvTear
          7 = PathChg
          8 = ResvChg

   Flags: 4 bits
          0x1 = Uncharged
          This bit is valid only for a Resv message. When this bit is
          set, the flow is not charged and parameters related to charging
          in Sspec, a path is calculated just according to bandwidth and
          delay.
