1  Introduction

   Different kinds of network Service Function (SF) have been deployed
   in current network to provide network service for traffic. But
   current SF deployments are tightly coupled to network topology and
   physical resources, and this limits the ability of an operator to
   introduce new services and/or service functions. To overcome the
   disadvantages of current SF deployments, flexible SFC (Service
   Function Chain) is under discussion in IETF [SFC PS].

   Though SFC domain is typically deployed by the owner of carrier
   network, here we treat SFC domain and carrier network as two separate
   network domain. A typical relationship between carrier network and
   SFC domain is shown in Figure 1. When network traffic goes through
   SFC domain, the SFC domain needs to know how to steer the traffic,
   i.e. which service chain the traffic should pass. The carrier network
   and SFC domain should interact properly in order to provide network
   service to traffic.

   LTE (Long Term Evolution) network [TS23.401] is standardized by 3rd
   Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), the basic architecture of LTE
   network is shown in Figure 2, three network entities including
   eNodeB, SGW and PDN-GW form the data path for user's traffic from UE
   to IP service network, and MME (Mobility Management Entity) acts as a
   central control point of the network.

   [TS29.061].

   Gi-LAN service area is presently used by mobile network operator to
   differentiate their services to their subscribers; mobile network
   operator could deploy any kinds of SFs, e.g. Firewall, video
   optimizer, NAT (Network Address Translator), to provide network
   service for user's traffic.

   This document use LTE network as an example to illustrate how carrier
   network and SFC domain could cooperate to provide network service to
   traffic.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   SFC domain: or SFC network, a network that implements SFC.

2.  Interaction between LTE network and SFC domain

   In this section, we will discuss how SFC domain could provide network
   service for traffic in LTE network.

2.1  Interaction model

   Before the discussion of interaction between LTE network and SFC
   domain, we first introduce the concept of Logical Service Function
   Chain (LSFC) and Physical Service Function Chain (PSFC). LSFC is a
   service function chain which is consisted of a list of SF type, and
   no specific SF instance is included in LSFC. 

   PSFC is a service function chain which is consisted of a list of SF
   instance, so PSFC could be viewed as an instance of LSFC. Considering
   of the requirements of load balance, there could be more than one
   instance for one type of SF, so a LSFC could be mapped into one or
   more PSFC.

   LSFC stands for a requirement of service function chain for certain
   traffic, and PSFC is a physical implementation that satisfies the
   requirement.

   When we take LTE network and SFC domain as two separate domains, LTE
   network plays the role of producing network service requirements and
   SFC domain plays the role of providing network service for LTE
   network's traffic.

   An overview of interaction between LTE network and SFC domain is
   depicted in Figure 4. LTE network creates LSFC for traffic and sends
   the LSFC to SFC domain, and then SFC domain is in charge of
   translating LSFC to PSFC. 

   Besides LSFC, additional information such as subscriber ID, that
   might be used but could not be accessed directly by SFC domain, will
   also be conveyed in service chain request procedure. 

              service chain request           
          +----------------------------+      
          |                            |      
          |                            |      
   +------|----+    traffic       +----V-----+
   |LTE Network| <==============> |SFC domain|
   +-----------+                  +----------+

  Figure 4 Overview of Interaction between LTE network and SFC domain

   There are sorts of information that could be used in creating of
   LSFC:

   - Mobile user's subscription information. For example, the network
   operator could provide video optimization service for gold and silver
   user's video traffic, but not for bronze user's traffic.
   - Network status information. For example, the radio access type that
   the mobile user currently attached to or the network congestion level
   could affect the choice of video optimizer for video traffic.
   - Agreement between content provider and network operator. Content
   provider, e.g. YouTube, could rent TCP optimization or video
   optimization function for its traffic, so for the traffic of content
   provider that has service agreement with network operator certain
   service function could be implemented. 
   - Application Characteristics. Application characteristics play very
   important role in creating service chain for the traffic, different
   kinds of application traffic, such as Web application and video
   application, would definitely go through different service chain.
   - QoS information of the service. QoS information of LTE network
   traffic could affect the choice of specific SF.

   Per operator's consideration, the combination of different
   information can be used in creating LSFC for the traffic.

2.2  Information exchange

   This sub-section discusses what information elements should be
   conveyed in service chain request procedure from LTE network to SFC
   domain as depicted in Figure 4.

   As discussed in sub-section 2.1, LSFC will be conveyed in service
   chain request.
   +-----------+---------------------------------------------------+
   | Match rule| To identify which traffic the LSFC is specific to.|
   +-----------+---------------------------------------------------+
   | LSFC      | To specify network service function chain that    |
   |           | will act on the traffic.                          |
   +-----------+---------------------------------------------------+
   | Additional| SFC related auxiliary information such as User's  |
   | info      | Subscriber ID.                                    |
