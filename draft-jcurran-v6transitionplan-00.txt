1. Introduction

  This memo provides one possible plan for transitioning the Internet 
  from a predominantly IPv4-based connectivity model to a predominantly 
  IPv6-based connectivity model.

  Other transition plans are possible and this purely informational
  document does not create an obligation on any party to undertake any 
  of the actions specified herein.

  The purpose of specifying this particular transition plan is to allow 
  for overall assessment of the viability of accomplishing the desired 
  transition and to begin the discussion of Internet-wide transition 
  plans in general. 

2. Phased Transition Model

  It is not reasonable to specify the changes that each and every system
  connected to the Internet must undergo in order to achieve the desired
  transition, as the number of connected systems precludes creating one 
  plan that contains such a level of detail.  Further, while there are
  common scenarios that may be specified for transitioning individual
  networks (refer to [RFC3750] [RFC4057] and [CAMP]), the specific
  timeline and mechanisms utilized for a given network will be unique.
  Despite these challenges, it is necessary to coordinate expectations
  on an overall basis so that Internet-wide connectivity is maintained 
  throughout the transition. 

  This plan delineates specific phases for the transition activities, 
  and further breaks downs the necessary activities within each phase 
  based on the role that an organization plays in the provision of
  Internet services. 

  The three proposed phases are: Preparation Phase, Transition Phase, 
  and Post-Transition Phase.

Internet-Draft          An Internet Transition Plan            July 2007

2.1  Preparation Phase - Present to December 2008

  In the Preparation Phase, entities prepare to provide 
  Internet-facing services via IPv6-based connectivity
  while continuing to provide Internet-facing services
  via IPv4 connectivity.

  During the Preparation Phase, the following principles apply:

  2.1.1 Service Providers SHOULD offer IPv6-based Internet Service 
       to their Internet customers.  IPv6-based Internet Service 
       MAY be provided via IPv6 transition mechanisms or native 
       IPv6 network service.
  2.1.2 Organizations SHOULD arrange for IPv6-based Interent 
       connectivity for any Internet-facing servers (e.g. web, 
       email, and domain name servers).  Internet-facing IPv6 
       servers MAY be treated as production by the organization, 
       but MUST NOT be treated as production by other Internet 
       organizations.
  2.1.3 Organizations MAY provide IPv6-based Internet connectivity 
       to internal user communities.

2.2  Transition Phase - January 2009 to December 2010

  In the Transition Phase, entities provide Internet-facing services
  via IPv6-based connectivity in addition to IPv4-based connectivity.

  During the Transition Phase, the following principles apply:

  2.2.1 Service Providers MUST offer IPv6-based Internet Service to 
       their Internet customers. IPv6-based Internet Service SHOULD 
       be via native IPv6 network service but MAY be via IPv6 
       transition mechanisms if necessary.  
  2.2.2 Organizations MUST arrange for IPv6-based Interent 
       connectivity for any Internet-facing servers (e.g. web, 
       email, and domain name servers).  Internet-facing IPv6 
       servers SHOULD be treated as production by the organization, 
       and MAY be treated as production by other Internet 
       organizations.
  2.2.3 Organizations SHOULD provide IPv6-based Internet connectivity
       to their internal user communities, and provide IPv6 internal
       supporting servers (e.g. DNS, DHCP). IPv6-based Internet 
       connectivity MAY be via native IPv6 network service or MAY 
       be via IPv6 transition mechanisms.

2.3 Post-Transition Phase - January 2011 to the Future

  In the Post-Transition Phase, entities provide all Internet-facing 
  services via IPv6-based connectivity.

  During the Post-Transition Phase, the following principles apply:
  2.3.1 Service Providers MUST offer IPv6-based Internet Service to 
       their Internet customers. IPv6-based Internet Service SHOULD be 
       via native IPv6 network service but MAY be via IPv6 transition 
       mechanisms if necessary.  IPv6-based Internet Service SHOULD be 
       treated as production by other Internet organizations.
  2.3.2 Organizations MUST arrange for IPv6-based Internet connectivity 
       for any Internet-facing servers (e.g. web, email, and domain  
       name servers).  Internet-facing IPv6 servers MUST be treated
       as production by the organization, and SHOULD be treated as 
       production by other Internet organizations.
  2.3.3 Organizations SHOULD provide IPv6-based Internet connectivity to 
       internal user communities, and provide IPv6 internal supporting 
       servers (e.g. DNS, DHCP)  IPv6-based Internet connectivity MAY
       be via native IPv6 network service or MAY be via IPv6 transition 
       mechanisms.  
  2.3.4 Service Providers area MAY continue to offer IPv4-based Internet 
       connectivity to their customers.  Organizations MAY continue to 
       use IPv4-based Internet connectivity.  Organizations MAY remove
       IPv4-based Internet connectivity from Internet-facing servers.


3. Summary

  In order to facilitate full Internet-wide connectivity during the 
  transition from IPv4-based connectivity to IPv6-based connectivity, 
  a transition plan which provides clear guidance to organizations 
  regarding expectations is necessary.  As the specific expectations 
  change over time, and vary greatly by organization, a phased approach 
  is specified in this document, with the timeline for each phase set 
  with the intention of allowing enough time for the necessary planning 
  and deployment steps which each organization much undertake.  This 
  Internet Transition Plan provides for transition to predominantly 
  IPv6-connectivity by January 2011 which, with careful management, may 
  meet the overall requirements of allowing the Internet to scale as 
  specified in "The Recommendation for the IP Next Generation Protocol" 
  [RFC1752].
  

4. Security Considerations

  This memo describes the transition of the Internet from IPv4-based 
  connectivity to predominantly IPv6-based connectivity.  This change
  inherently has security implications due to the widespread deployment
  of a new version of the Internet Protocol but these are beyond the 
  scope of this document and are covered in [IPV6SEC].  This document 
  raises no new security issues itself.

5. IANA Considerations

  While no new name or identifier space is created by this document, 
  the policies for management of Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4)
  address space (which were formed in accordance with [RFC2050]) may 
  not provide for IPv4 availability through the Transition Phase as 
  intended by this plan.  The IANA should continue work with all parties
  to encourage sufficient availability of IPv4 address resources as 
  necessary to support any resulting transition plan that receives 
  wide-spead adoption.
