1. Introduction

    To implement a Signature based single signON authentication
    

2. Background
     A signature based authentication is more natural than a User name
     password authentication, as one WWW user could have multiple User names
     and passwords in multiple services.
	I Switch on my laptop, computer or tablet and i sign in. The signature
     can be my favourite poem. And i should be able to change my Signature.
     When i create user accounts in services, i can associate this signature
     to the User accounts. New services can eliminate the need for User names
     as appropriate. 

	A Signature database can have information about the owner of the signature
     and services that user can access. 
	
3. General Information of the service
	
	
      A signature can also be send on the network and available in weblogs.
      A User Viewing my website knows signs on my weblogs and using that Public
      Signature, i can know many details about who has viewed my site. 

	But only the owner of the Signature can be able to access his or her services. 
      There are many solutions to this.But a USer signing in to a WWW computer with
      his SIgnature like "I really want to eat Vegan food but forced to eat South Indian
      food because of Cyber crime" OR "I hate interacting with Police as they are the 
      product of a corrupt and criminal system" does not need to know about the implementation
      details nor me as a WWW user defining requirements need to know about how it is implemented.
