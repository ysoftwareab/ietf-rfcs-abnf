                  draft-ietf-ospf-encapsulation-cap-05

Abstract

   Networks use tunnels for a variety of reasons.  A large variety of
   tunnel types are defined and the ingress needs to select a type of
   tunnel which is supported by the egress and itself.  This document
   defines how to advertise egress tunnel capabilities in OSPF Router
   Information Link State Advertisement (LSAs).

1.  Introduction

   Networks use tunnels for a variety of reasons, such as:

   o  Partial deployment of MPLS-SPRING as described in
      [I-D.xu-mpls-unified-source-routing-instruction], where IP tunnels

      are used between MPLS-SPRING-enabled routers to traverse non-MPLS
      routers.

   o  Partial deployment of MPLS-BIER as described in
      [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture], where IP tunnels are used between
      MPLS-BIER-capable routers to traverse non MPLS-BIER
      [I-D.ietf-bier-mpls-encapsulation] routers.

   o  Partial deployment of IPv6 in IPv4 networks or IPv4 in IPv6
      networks as described in [RFC5565], where IPvx tunnels are used
      between IPvx-enabled routers so as to traverse non-IPvx routers.

   o  Remote Loop-Free Alternate (RLFA) repair tunnels as described in
      [RFC7490], where tunnels are used between the Point of Local
      Repair and the selected PQ node.

   The ingress needs to select a type of tunnel which is supported by
   the egress and itself.  This document describes how to use OSPF
   Router Information Link State Advertisements (LSAs) to advertise the
   egress tunneling capabilities of OSPF routers.  In this document,
   OSPF refers to both OSPFv2 [RFC2328] and OSPFv3 [RFC5340].

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC7770].

3.  Advertising Encapsulation Capability

   Routers advertise their supported encapsulation type(s) by
   advertising a new TLV of the OSPF Router Information (RI) Opaque LSA
   [RFC7770], referred to as the Encapsulation Capability TLV.  This TLV
   is applicable to both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.  The Encapsulation
   Capability TLV SHOULD NOT appear more than once within a given OSPF
   Router Information (RI) Opaque LSA.  If the Encapsulation Capability
   TLV appears more than once in an OSPF Router Information LSA, only
   the first occurrence MUST be processed and others MUST be ignored.
   The scope of the advertisement depends on the application but it is
   recommended that it SHOULD be domain- wide.  The Type code of the
   Encapsulation Capability TLV is TBD1, the Length value is variable,
   and the Value field contains one or more Tunnel Encapsulation Type
   Sub-TLVs.  Each Encapsulation Type Sub-TLVs indicates a particular
   encapsulation format that the advertising router supports along with
   the parameters to be used for the tunnel.

4.  Tunnel Encapsulation Type

   The Tunnel Encapsulation Type Sub-TLV is structured as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |    Tunnel Type (2 Octets)     |        Length (2 Octets)      |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                                                               |
      |                            Sub-TLVs                           |
      |                                                               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      Tunnel Type (2 octets): Identifies the type of tunneling
      technology being signaled.  Tunnel types are shared with the BGP
      extension [RFC5512] and hence are defined in the IANA registry
      "BGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute Tunnel Types".  Unknown types
      are to be ignored and skipped upon receipt.

      Length (2 octets): Unsigned 16-bit integer indicating the total
      number of octets of the value field.

      Value (variable): Zero or more Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute Sub-
      TLVs as defined in Section 5.

5.  Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute

   The Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute Sub-TLV is structured as follows:

              +-----------------------------------+
              |      Sub-TLV Type (1 Octet)       |
              +-----------------------------------+
              |     Sub-TLV Length (1 Octet)      |
              +-----------------------------------+
              |     Sub-TLV Value (Variable)      |
              |                                   |
              +-----------------------------------+

      Sub-TLV Type (1 octet): Each Sub-TLV type defines a certain
      property of the tunnel TLV that contains this Sub-TLV.  This
      document defines such types Section 6 )

      Sub-TLV Length (1 octet): Unsigned 8-bit integer indicating the
      total number of octets of the Sub-TLV value field.

Internet-Draft                                                 July 2017


      Sub-TLV Value (variable): Encodings of the value field depend on
      the Sub-TLV type as enumerated above.  The following sub-sections
      define the encoding in detail.

   Any unknown Sub-TLVs MUST be ignored and skipped upon receipt.
   However, if the TLV is understood, the entire TLV MUST NOT be ignored
   just because it contains an unknown Sub-TLV.

   If a Sub-TLV is invalid, this specific Tunnel Encapsulation MUST be
   ignored and skipped.  However, other Tunnel Encapsulations MUST be
   considered.

6.  Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute Sub-TLVs

6.1.  Encapsulation Sub-TLV

   This Sub-TLV is defined in section 3.2 "Encapsulation Sub-TLVs for
   Particular Tunnel Types" of [I-D.ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps] from both a
   syntax and semantic standpoint.  Usage is defined in Section 7.

6.2.  Protocol Type Sub-TLV

   This Sub-TLV is defined in section 3.4.1 "Protocol Type sub-TLV" of
   [I-D.ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps] from a syntactic, semantic, and usage
   standpoint.

6.3.  Endpoint Sub-TLV

   The value field carries the Network Address to be used as tunnel
   destination address.

   If length is 4, the tunnel endpoint is an IPv4 address.

   If length is 16, the tunnel endpoint is an IPv6 address.

6.4.  Color Sub-TLV

   The valued field is a 4-octet opaque unsigned integer.

   The color value is user-defined and configured locally on the
   advertising routers.  It may be used by service providers to define
   policies on the ingress routers, for example, to control the
   selection of the tunnel to use.

   This color value can be referenced by BGP routes carrying Color
   Extended Community [I-D.ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps].  If the tunnel is
   used to reach the BGP Next-Hop of BGP routes, then attaching a Color

   Extended Community attached to those routes express the willingness
   of the BGP speaker to use a tunnel of the same color.

6.5.  IP QoS Field

   This Sub-TLV is defined in section 3.3.1 "IPv4 DS Field" of
   [I-D.ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps] from a syntactic, semantic and usage
   standpoint.

6.6.  UDP Destination Port

   This Sub-TLV is defined in section 3.3.2 "UDP Destination Port" of
   [I-D.ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps] from a syntactic, semantic and usage
   standpoint.

6.7.  future sub-TLV allocations

   [I-D.ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps] similarly defines Tunnel Encapsulation
   Attribute Sub-TLVs.  IGP and BGP have separate IANA registries
   allowing for separate sub-TLV definitions.  If the same information
   is to be advertised for both IGP and BGP tunnel encapsulation, it is
   RECOMMENDED to use the same code point, semantic and syntax.
   However, it is to be noted that the "BGP Tunnel Encapsulation
   Attribute Sub-TLVs" registry, allows for sub-TLV with two octets of
   length, while the "IGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute Sub-TLVs"
   registry only allows for one octet of length.  Hence two-octets BGP
   Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute Sub-TLVs won't be able to be defined
   for IGP Tunnels.  Eventually, their information may be split over
   multiple sub-TLVs.

7.  Usage of the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute

   The advertisement of an Encapsulation Type Sub-TLVs indicates that
   the advertising router support a particular tunnel encapsulation
   along with the parameters to be used for the tunnel.  The decision to
   use that tunnel is driven by the capability of the ingress router to
   support the encapsulation type and the policy on the ingress router.
   The color sub-TLV may be used as an input to this policy.  Note that
   some tunnel types may require the execution of an explicit tunnel
   setup protocol before they can be used to carry data.

   A tunnel MUST NOT be used if there is no route toward the IP address
   specified in the Endpoint Sub-TLV or if the route is not advertised
   by the router advertising the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute for the
   tunnel.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  OSPF Router Information

   This document requests IANA to allocate a new code point from the
   OSPF Router Information (RI) registry.

       Value   TLV Name                               Reference
       -----   ------------------------------------   -------------
       TBD1    Tunnel Capabilities                    This document

8.2.  IGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute Sub-TLVs Registry

   This document requests IANA to create a new registry "IGP Tunnel
   Encapsulation Attribute Sub-TLVs" with the following registration
   procedure:

              Registry Name: IGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute Sub-TLVs

   Value      Name                                      Reference
   -------    ------------------------------------      -------------

       255    Reserved                                  This document

   Assignments of Encapsulation Attribute Types are via Standards Action
   [RFC5226].

9.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations applicable to softwires can be found in the
   mesh framework [RFC5565].  In general, security issues of the tunnel
   protocols signaled through this OSPF capability extension are
   inherited.

   If a third-party is able to modify any of the information that is
   used to form encapsulation headers, to choose a tunnel type, or to
   choose a particular tunnel for a particular payload type, user data
   packets may end up getting misrouted, misdelivered, and/or dropped.
