        IANA Guidance for Managing the ULE Next-Header Registry
                   draft-fairhurst-ipdvb-ule-iana-06

Abstract

   This document proposes an update to RFC 4326 to clarify and update
   the allocation rules for the Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation
   (ULE) Next-Header registry.  This registry is used by ULE and Generic
   Stream Encapsulation (GSE) to record the code points of extension
   headers and protocols supported by these encapsulation protocols.

1.  Introduction

   The Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE) [RFC4326]
   specifies an encapsulation for links that employ the MPEG-2 Transport
   Stream, with support over a wide variety of physical-layer bearers
   [RFC4259].  The encapsulation header includes a Type field that
   identifies payload types and extension headers (e.g.[RFC5163]).  The
   ULE specification requested IANA to maintain the ULE next header
   registries to record the allocation of the values used to derive this
   Type field.

   The Digital Video Broadcast (DVB) Project has published an
   encapsulation for second-generation DVB physical layers.  This
   specifies the Generic Stream Encapsulation [GSE].  This encapsulation
   shares many of the network properties of ULE and uses a common format
   for the Type field [RFC5163].  The ULE Next Header registries are
   therefore also applicable to this encapsulation.

   This document updates the IANA rules and guidance defined in section
   11.1 of [RFC4326] in the following way:

   o  The document clarifies use of the ULE Next-Header registry by GSE
      as well as for ULE.

   o  Section 3 specifies that new allocations in the ULE Next-Header
      registry are to be assigned by IANA using the "Expert Review"
      policy and provides guidance to the expert reviewer.

   o  Section 3.3 reserves a range of allocated values.

   o  Section 4 adds an explanatory note to clarify the encoding used in
      the ULE Next-Header registry.

2.  Terminology

   This document assumes familiarity with the terminology of ULE
   [RFC4326] and [RFC5163].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.1.  The ULE Next Header Registries

   The mandatory extension headers are allocated in the ULE Next Header
   registry with decimal values in the range 0-255.  The registered
   value corresponds to the 16-bit Type value for the mandatory
   extension header or to identify a specific protocol.

   The optional extension headers are allocated in the ULE Next Header
   registry with decimal values in the range 256-511.  The registered
   value corresponds to the 16-bit Type value that would be used for an
   optional extension header with a length (H-LEN) of 1.

2.2.  Informative example of using a value from the optional range

   This section provides an informative example of how a registry entry
   is constructed to identify an optional ULE extension header.

   Values registered by IANA in the optional ULE extension header range
   correspond to a 16-bit Type value with the H-LEN field (in bits 5 to
   7) set to a decimal value of 1.  This registration format is used
   irrespective of the H-LEN value to be used.  Bits 8 to 15 of the
   value in the registry are combined with the actual required H-LEN
   value (bits 5 to 7) to form the 16-bit Type field.

   For example, the decimal value 256 has been allocated to denote the
   padding extension header.

   o  Type value 256: When a 2-byte padding extension header is used,
      the H-LEN is 1, resulting in a Type value with a decimal value of
      256 (as allocated), corresponding to a hexadecimal value of 0x100.

   o  Type value 768: When a 6-byte padding extension header is used,
      the H-LEN is 3, resulting in a Type value with a decimal value of
      768, corresponding to a hexadecimal value of 0x300.

3.  Updated IANA guidance on allocation in the ULE Next Header Registry

   The rules for allocation were defined in section 11 of [RFC4326].
   This document updates these rules by replacing them with the rules in
   this section:

   Allocations in the ULE Next-Header Registry are to be assigned by
   IANA using the "Expert Review" policy defined in [RFC5226].
   Applications must include a reference to a specification of the next
   header extension in a standards document.  An IETF standards-track
   RFC can provide such a reference.  Other specifications are also
   permitted.  The expert shall advise IANA on whether a particular
   specification constitutes a standards document.

3.1.  ULE Next-Header Registry

   This registry allocates Next-Header values within the range 0-511
   (decimal).  For each allocated value, it also specifies the set of
   allowed H-LEN values (see [RFC4326] section 5).  The combination of
   the IANA-registered value and the H-LEN are used by ULE and GSE to
   derive a set of allowed 16-bit values in the decimal range 0-1535.
   This forms the first part of the ULE Type space (see [RFC4326]
   section 4.4.1).

3.2.  IANA Guidelines

   The following contains the IANA guidelines for management of the ULE
   Next-Header registry.  This registry allocates decimal values 0-511
   (0x0000-0x01FF, hexadecimal).  IANA MUST NOT allocate values greater
   than 511 (decimal).

   The ULE Next-Header registry is divided into two ranges:

   1.  0-255 (decimal) IANA-assigned values, indicating Mandatory
       Extension Headers (or link-dependent Type fields).  Requests for
       assignment in this range MUST define the value and the name
       associated with the Extension Header, together with the procedure
       for processing the Extension Header.  This MUST also define the
       need for the Mandatory Extension and the intended use.  [RFC4326]
       made initial assignments to this range of values in the registry,
       updated by later requests.  The size of the Extension Header MUST
       be specified (by default the entire remaining payload).

   2.  256-511 (decimal) IANA-assigned values, indicating Optional
       Extension Headers.  Requests for assignment in this range MUST
       define the value and the name associated with the Extension
       Header, together with the procedure for processing the Extension
       Header.  The entry MUST specify the range of allowable H-LEN
       values that are permitted (in the range 1-5).  It MUST also
       define the need for the Optional Extension and the intended use.
       [RFC4326] made initial assignments to this range of values in the
       registry, updated by later requests.

3.3.  Reservation of Next Header values for Private Use

   This document reserves the range decimal 144-159 (0x80-0x8F,
   hexadecimal) for Private Use.

   These values are not available for allocation by IANA.  Appropriate
   use includes development of experimental options for which either no
   general-purpose solution was planned, where insufficient operational
   experience was available to understand if a general solution is
   needed, or where a more general solution is not yet mature.  This use
   is not coordinated between users of these values, so the uniqueness
   of a particular value can not be guaranteed.

   Authors of specifications (see Section 3.0) SHOULD contact IANA to
   request a new value to be allocated in the ULE Next-Header registry.
   An IANA-allocated value uniquely identifies the method.  Such an
   allocation is REQUIRED for any method that is to be standardised.

4.  Update to registry information

   This section requests IANA to record an additional explanatory note
   in the ULE Next-Header registry:

   "The Mandatory Extension Header range in the ULE Next-Header registry
   is used to allocate values in the range 0-255 (decimal).  These
   values are used to identify mandatory extension headers.  The
   registered value corresponds to the 16-bit Type value for the
   mandatory extension header or the specified protocol.

   The Optional Extension Header range in the ULE Next-Header registry
   is used to allocate values in the range 256-511 (decimal).  These
   values are used to identify optional extension headers.  The
   registered value corresponds to the 16-bit Type value that would be
   used for an optional extension header with a header length (H-LEN) of
   1."

   This additional note should be placed before the current note.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not present new security considerations.

6.  IANA Considerations

   Section 3 specifies updated IANA allocation rules

   Section 3.3 requests IANA to reserve the range decimal 144-159
   (0x80-0x8F, hexadecimal) and to mark this as Reserved for Private
   Use.

   Section 4 requests IANA to update the ULE Next-Header registry
   information.
