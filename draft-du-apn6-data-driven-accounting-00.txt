1.  Introduction

   Application-aware IPv6 Networking is a kind of self-identified
   mechanism per packet.  In the mechanism of APN6
   [I-D.li-apn6-problem-statement-usecases], an IPv6 packet can carry
   the APP ID information and SLA requirements of the traffic in its
   Extension Headers.  Therefore, the network equipment can analyze them
   in each packet and handle the packet accordingly.

   In this mechanism, different user traffic can get different
   treatments so that the network resource can be used more efficiently.
   As the emergence of various new services with various requirements,
   the same treatment for all traffic cannot continue to be sustainable
   in future.

   Current usecases in APN6 only mention different treatments of the
   traffic, but do not mention the way to account, which is essential
   for the operator.  If the operators can charge for APN services
   properly, the APN technologies will be adopted more quickly.

   This document introduces the usecase and the general process about
   the data-driven accounting in APN6.

2.  Current Mechanism in APN6

   As shown in Figure 1, the APN framework [I-D.li-apn-framework]
   includes App (Client and Server), App-aware Edge, App-aware-process
   Head-End, App-aware-process Mid-Point, and App-aware-process End-
   Point.

   The data-driven process of APN6 is described below.

   The APP or the APP-aware Edge will generate an APN packet which
   carries the application characteristic information in the
   encapsulation.  The information may include application-aware
   identification, such as SLA level, application ID, user ID, flow ID,
   etc., and network performance requirements, such as bandwidth,
   latency, jitter, packet loss ratio, etc.  The former is recorded in
   the Application-aware ID Options, and the latter is recorded in the
   Service-Para Options defined in the [I-D.li-apn-framework].

   App-aware-process Head-End can read that information and steer the
   packet into a given policy which satisfies the application
   requirements.  It is supposed that a set of paths, tunnels or SR
   policies, exist between the App-aware-process Head-End and the App-
   aware-process End-Point.  App-aware-process Head-End can find one
   existing path or establish a new one for the traffic.

3.  Data-driven Accounting Usecase

   In the APN architecture, a client can send both normal IPv6 packets
   and APN encapsulated packets simultaneously, which may trigger
   complicated accounting/charging mechanisms.

   As the treatment of the APN packets may be various according to
   multiple factors, such as the time of accessing the network, the
   network conditions, etc., a flexible accounting mechanism is needed.
   In addition, it is better that the accounting mechanism can support
   negotiations between the client and the accounting point.

   For example, a user occasionally needs to transfer an import file or
   attend an important meeting, they can use this APN-based data-driven
   mechanism to trigger a better network service and pay a reasonable
   amount of money.

4.  General Process of the Data-driven Accounting

   The general process of data-driven accounting is described as below.

   Firstly, the client inform the the accounting point, which is
   normally also the gateway of the client, about the requirement of the
   traffic, and optionally including the cost the user can offer.

   Secondly, the network provide the service accordingly.

   Thirdly, the client can do the accounting itself, and occasionally
   send a specific APN packet to the accounting point to align the
   accounting information.

   Fourthly, the network confirm the accounting information received
   from the client, and make a decision about further treatment of the
   traffic.

   Finally, the client may terminate the service and the accounting.

   As the client and the accounting point can negotiate by using this
   APN mechanism, a more flexible accounting mechanism is enabled.  In
   this mechanism, the client can participate the accounting, and the
   accounting point needs to confirm the legality of the APN accounting
   packets.  Therefore, the APN accounting packet should include
   accounting information of the flow and the signature of the client
   for the packet.

   The accounting point can notify the client about an SRv6 Accounting
   Function before the service accessing.  In this case, the accounting
   information and the signature can be carried in the SRv6 SID list or
   some other places of the SRH.
