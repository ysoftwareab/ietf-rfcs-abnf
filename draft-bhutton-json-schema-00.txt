        JSON Schema: A Media Type for Describing JSON Documents
                      draft-bhutton-json-schema-00

Abstract

   JSON Schema defines the media type "application/schema+json", a JSON-
   based format for describing the structure of JSON data.  JSON Schema
   asserts what a JSON document must look like, ways to extract
   information from it, and how to interact with it.  The "application/
   schema-instance+json" media type provides additional feature-rich
   integration with "application/schema+json" beyond what can be offered
   for "application/json" documents.

1.  Introduction

   JSON Schema is a JSON media type for defining the structure of JSON
   data.  JSON Schema is intended to define validation, documentation,
   hyperlink navigation, and interaction control of JSON data.

   This specification defines JSON Schema core terminology and
   mechanisms, including pointing to another JSON Schema by reference,
   dereferencing a JSON Schema reference, specifying the dialect being
   used, specifying a dialect's vocabulary requirements, and defining
   the expected output.

   Other specifications define the vocabularies that perform assertions
   about validation, linking, annotation, navigation, and interaction.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The terms "JSON", "JSON text", "JSON value", "member", "element",
   "object", "array", "number", "string", "boolean", "true", "false",
   and "null" in this document are to be interpreted as defined in RFC
   8259 [RFC8259].

3.  Overview

   This document proposes a new media type "application/schema+json" to
   identify a JSON Schema for describing JSON data.  It also proposes a
   further optional media type, "application/schema-instance+json", to
   provide additional integration features.  JSON Schemas are themselves
   JSON documents.  This, and related specifications, define keywords
   allowing authors to describe JSON data in several ways.

   JSON Schema uses keywords to assert constraints on JSON instances or
   annotate those instances with additional information.  Additional
   keywords are used to apply assertions and annotations to more complex
   JSON data structures, or based on some sort of condition.

   To facilitate re-use, keywords can be organized into vocabularies.  A
   vocabulary consists of a list of keywords, together with their syntax
   and semantics.  A dialect is defined as a set of vocabularies and
   their required support identified in a meta-schema.

   JSON Schema can be extended either by defining additional
   vocabularies, or less formally by defining additional keywords
   outside of any vocabulary.  Unrecognized individual keywords simply
   have their values collected as annotations, while the behavior with
   respect to an unrecognized vocabulary can be controlled when
   declaring which vocabularies are in use.

   This document defines a core vocabulary that MUST be supported by any
   implementation, and cannot be disabled.  Its keywords are each
   prefixed with a "$" character to emphasize their required nature.
   This vocabulary is essential to the functioning of the "application/
   schema+json" media type, and is used to bootstrap the loading of
   other vocabularies.

   Additionally, this document defines a RECOMMENDED vocabulary of
   keywords for applying subschemas conditionally, and for applying
   subschemas to the contents of objects and arrays.  Either this
   vocabulary or one very much like it is required to write schemas for

   non-trivial JSON instances, whether those schemas are intended for
   assertion validation, annotation, or both.  While not part of the
   required core vocabulary, for maximum interoperability this
   additional vocabulary is included in this document and its use is
   strongly encouraged.

   Further vocabularies for purposes such as structural validation or
   hypermedia annotation are defined in other documents.  These other
   documents each define a dialect collecting the standard sets of
   vocabularies needed to write schemas for that document's purpose.

4.  Definitions

4.1.  JSON Document

   A JSON document is an information resource (series of octets)
   described by the application/json media type.

   In JSON Schema, the terms "JSON document", "JSON text", and "JSON
   value" are interchangeable because of the data model it defines.

   JSON Schema is only defined over JSON documents.  However, any
   document or memory structure that can be parsed into or processed
   according to the JSON Schema data model can be interpreted against a
   JSON Schema, including media types like CBOR [RFC7049].

4.2.  Instance

   A JSON document to which a schema is applied is known as an
   "instance".

   JSON Schema is defined over "application/json" or compatible
   documents, including media types with the "+json" structured syntax
   suffix.

   Among these, this specification defines the "application/schema-
   instance+json" media type which defines handling for fragments in the
   URI.

4.2.1.  Instance Data Model

   JSON Schema interprets documents according to a data model.  A JSON
   value interpreted according to this data model is called an
   "instance".

   An instance has one of six primitive types, and a range of possible
   values depending on the type:




Wright, et al.            Expires June 11, 2021                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                 December 2020


   null:  A JSON "null" value

   boolean:  A "true" or "false" value, from the JSON "true" or "false"
      value

   object:  An unordered set of properties mapping a string to an
      instance, from the JSON "object" value

   array:  An ordered list of instances, from the JSON "array" value

   number:  An arbitrary-precision, base-10 decimal number value, from
      the JSON "number" value

   string:  A string of Unicode code points, from the JSON "string"
      value

   Whitespace and formatting concerns, including different lexical
   representations of numbers that are equal within the data model, are
   thus outside the scope of JSON Schema.  JSON Schema vocabularies
   (Section 8.1) that wish to work with such differences in lexical
   representations SHOULD define keywords to precisely interpret
   formatted strings within the data model rather than relying on having
   the original JSON representation Unicode characters available.

   Since an object cannot have two properties with the same key,
   behavior for a JSON document that tries to define two properties with
   the same key in a single object is undefined.

   Note that JSON Schema vocabularies are free to define their own
   extended type system.  This should not be confused with the core data
   model types defined here.  As an example, "integer" is a reasonable
   type for a vocabulary to define as a value for a keyword, but the
   data model makes no distinction between integers and other numbers.

4.2.2.  Instance Equality

   Two JSON instances are said to be equal if and only if they are of
   the same type and have the same value according to the data model.
   Specifically, this means:

      both are null; or

      both are true; or

      both are false; or

      both are strings, and are the same codepoint-for-codepoint; or




Wright, et al.            Expires June 11, 2021                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                 December 2020


      both are numbers, and have the same mathematical value; or

      both are arrays, and have an equal value item-for-item; or

      both are objects, and each property in one has exactly one
      property with a key equal to the other's, and that other property
      has an equal value.

   Implied in this definition is that arrays must be the same length,
   objects must have the same number of members, properties in objects
   are unordered, there is no way to define multiple properties with the
   same key, and mere formatting differences (indentation, placement of
   commas, trailing zeros) are insignificant.

4.2.3.  Non-JSON Instances

   It is possible to use JSON Schema with a superset of the JSON Schema
   data model, where an instance may be outside any of the six JSON data
   types.

   In this case, annotations still apply; but most validation keywords
   will not be useful, as they will always pass or always fail.

   A custom vocabulary may define support for a superset of the core
   data model.  The schema itself may only be expressible in this
   superset; for example, to make use of the "const" keyword.

4.3.  JSON Schema Documents

   A JSON Schema document, or simply a schema, is a JSON document used
   to describe an instance.  A schema can itself be interpreted as an
   instance, but SHOULD always be given the media type "application/
   schema+json" rather than "application/schema-instance+json".  The
   "application/schema+json" media type is defined to offer a superset
   of the fragment identifier syntax and semantics provided by
   "application/schema-instance+json".

   A JSON Schema MUST be an object or a boolean.

4.3.1.  JSON Schema Objects and Keywords

   Object properties that are applied to the instance are called
   keywords, or schema keywords.  Broadly speaking, keywords fall into
   one of five categories:

   identifiers:  control schema identification through setting the
      schema's canonical URI and/or changing how the base URI is
      determined

   assertions:  produce a boolean result when applied to an instance

   annotations:  attach information to an instance for application use

   applicators:  apply one or more subschemas to a particular location
      in the instance, and combine or modify their results

   reserved locations:  do not directly affect results, but reserve a
      place for a specific purpose to ensure interoperability

   Keywords may fall into multiple categories, although applicators
   SHOULD only produce assertion results based on their subschemas'
   results.  They should not define additional constraints independent
   of their subschemas.

   Keywords which are properties within the same schema object are
   referred to as adjacent keywords.

   Extension keywords, meaning those defined outside of this document
   and its companions, are free to define other behaviors as well.

   A JSON Schema MAY contain properties which are not schema keywords.
   Unknown keywords SHOULD be treated as annotations, where the value of
   the keyword is the value of the annotation.

   An empty schema is a JSON Schema with no properties, or only unknown
   properties.

4.3.2.  Boolean JSON Schemas

   The boolean schema values "true" and "false" are trivial schemas that
   always produce themselves as assertion results, regardless of the
   instance value.  They never produce annotation results.

   These boolean schemas exist to clarify schema author intent and
   facilitate schema processing optimizations.  They behave identically
   to the following schema objects (where "not" is part of the subschema
   application vocabulary defined in this document).

   true:  Always passes validation, as if the empty schema {}

   false:  Always fails validation, as if the schema { "not": {} }

   While the empty schema object is unambiguous, there are many possible
   equivalents to the "false" schema.  Using the boolean values ensures
   that the intent is clear to both human readers and implementations.

4.3.3.  Schema Vocabularies

   A schema vocabulary, or simply a vocabulary, is a set of keywords,
   their syntax, and their semantics.  A vocabulary is generally
   organized around a particular purpose.  Different uses of JSON
   Schema, such as validation, hypermedia, or user interface generation,
   will involve different sets of vocabularies.

   Vocabularies are the primary unit of re-use in JSON Schema, as schema
   authors can indicate what vocabularies are required or optional in
   order to process the schema.  Since vocabularies are identified by
   URIs in the meta-schema, generic implementations can load extensions
   to support previously unknown vocabularies.  While keywords can be
   supported outside of any vocabulary, there is no analogous mechanism
   to indicate individual keyword usage.

4.3.4.  Meta-Schemas

   A schema that itself describes a schema is called a meta-schema.
   Meta-schemas are used to validate JSON Schemas and specify which
   vocabularies they are using.

   Typically, a meta-schema will specify a set of vocabularies, and
   validate schemas that conform to the syntax of those vocabularies.
   However, meta-schemas and vocabularies are separate in order to allow
   meta-schemas to validate schema conformance more strictly or more
   loosely than the vocabularies' specifications call for.  Meta-schemas
   may also describe and validate additional keywords that are not part
   of a formal vocabulary.

4.3.5.  Root Schema and Subschemas and Resources

   A JSON Schema resource is a schema which is canonically [RFC6596]
   identified by an absolute URI [RFC3986].

   The root schema is the schema that comprises the entire JSON document
   in question.  The root schema is always a schema resource, where the
   URI is determined as described in section 9.1.1.

   Some keywords take schemas themselves, allowing JSON Schemas to be
   nested:

   {
       "title": "root",
       "items": {
           "title": "array item"
       }
   }


   In this example document, the schema titled "array item" is a
   subschema, and the schema titled "root" is the root schema.

   As with the root schema, a subschema is either an object or a
   boolean.

   As discussed in section 8.2.1, a JSON Schema document can contain
   multiple JSON Schema resources.  When used without qualification, the
   term "root schema" refers to the document's root schema.  In some
   cases, resource root schemas are discussed.  A resource's root schema
   is its top-level schema object, which would also be a document root
   schema if the resource were to be extracted to a standalone JSON
   Schema document.

   Whether multiple schema resources are embedded or linked with a
   reference, they are processed in the same way, with the same
   available behaviors.

5.  Fragment Identifiers

   In accordance with section 3.1 of RFC 6839 [RFC6839], the syntax and
   semantics of fragment identifiers specified for any +json media type
   SHOULD be as specified for "application/json".  (At publication of
   this document, there is no fragment identification syntax defined for
   "application/json".)

   Additionally, the "application/schema+json" media type supports two
   fragment identifier structures: plain names and JSON Pointers.  The
   "application/schema-instance+json" media type supports one fragment
   identifier structure: JSON Pointers.

   The use of JSON Pointers as URI fragment identifiers is described in
   RFC 6901 [RFC6901].  For "application/schema+json", which supports
   two fragment identifier syntaxes, fragment identifiers matching the
   JSON Pointer syntax, including the empty string, MUST be interpreted
   as JSON Pointer fragment identifiers.

   Per the W3C's best practices for fragment identifiers
   [W3C.WD-fragid-best-practices-20121025], plain name fragment
   identifiers in "application/schema+json" are reserved for referencing

   locally named schemas.  All fragment identifiers that do not match
   the JSON Pointer syntax MUST be interpreted as plain name fragment
   identifiers.

   Defining and referencing a plain name fragment identifier within an
   "application/schema+json" document are specified in the "$anchor"
   keyword (Section 8.2.2) section.

6.  General Considerations

6.1.  Range of JSON Values

   An instance may be any valid JSON value as defined by JSON [RFC8259].
   JSON Schema imposes no restrictions on type: JSON Schema can describe
   any JSON value, including, for example, null.

6.2.  Programming Language Independence

   JSON Schema is programming language agnostic, and supports the full
   range of values described in the data model.  Be aware, however, that
   some languages and JSON parsers may not be able to represent in
   memory the full range of values describable by JSON.

6.3.  Mathematical Integers

   Some programming languages and parsers use different internal
   representations for floating point numbers than they do for integers.

   For consistency, integer JSON numbers SHOULD NOT be encoded with a
   fractional part.

6.4.  Regular Expressions

   Keywords MAY use regular expressions to express constraints, or
   constrain the instance value to be a regular expression.  These
   regular expressions SHOULD be valid according to the regular
   expression dialect described in ECMA-262, section 21.2.1 [ecma262].

   Regular expressions SHOULD be built with the "u" flag (or equivalent)
   to provide Unicode support, or processed in such a way which provides
   Unicode support as defined by ECMA-262.

   Furthermore, given the high disparity in regular expression
   constructs support, schema authors SHOULD limit themselves to the
   following regular expression tokens:

      individual Unicode characters, as defined by the JSON
      specification [RFC8259];

      simple character classes ([abc]), range character classes ([a-z]);

      complemented character classes ([^abc], [^a-z]);

      simple quantifiers: "+" (one or more), "*" (zero or more), "?"
      (zero or one), and their lazy versions ("+?", "*?", "??");

      range quantifiers: "{x}" (exactly x occurrences), "{x,y}" (at
      least x, at most y, occurrences), {x,} (x occurrences or more),
      and their lazy versions;

      the beginning-of-input ("^") and end-of-input ("$") anchors;

      simple grouping ("(...)") and alternation ("|").

   Finally, implementations MUST NOT take regular expressions to be
   anchored, neither at the beginning nor at the end.  This means, for
   instance, the pattern "es" matches "expression".

6.5.  Extending JSON Schema

   Additional schema keywords and schema vocabularies MAY be defined by
   any entity.  Save for explicit agreement, schema authors SHALL NOT
   expect these additional keywords and vocabularies to be supported by
   implementations that do not explicitly document such support.
   Implementations SHOULD treat keywords they do not support as
   annotations, where the value of the keyword is the value of the
   annotation.

   Implementations MAY provide the ability to register or load handlers
   for vocabularies that they do not support directly.  The exact
   mechanism for registering and implementing such handlers is
   implementation-dependent.

7.  Keyword Behaviors

   JSON Schema keywords fall into several general behavior categories.
   Assertions validate that an instance satisfies constraints, producing
   a boolean result.  Annotations attach information that applications
   may use in any way they see fit.  Applicators apply subschemas to
   parts of the instance and combine their results.

   Extension keywords SHOULD stay within these categories, keeping in
   mind that annotations in particular are extremely flexible.  Complex
   behavior is usually better delegated to applications on the basis of
   annotation data than implemented directly as schema keywords.
   However, extension keywords MAY define other behaviors for
   specialized purposes.

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                 December 2020


   Evaluating an instance against a schema involves processing all of
   the keywords in the schema against the appropriate locations within
   the instance.  Typically, applicator keywords are processed until a
   schema object with no applicators (and therefore no subschemas) is
   reached.  The appropriate location in the instance is evaluated
   against the assertion and annotation keywords in the schema object,
   and their results are gathered into the parent schema according to
   the rules of the applicator.

   Evaluation of a parent schema object can complete once all of its
   subschemas have been evaluated, although in some circumstances
   evaluation may be short-circuited due to assertion results.  When
   annotations are being collected, some assertion result short-
   circuiting is not possible due to the need to examine all subschemas
   for annotation collection, including those that cannot further change
   the assertion result.

7.1.  Lexical Scope and Dynamic Scope

   While most JSON Schema keywords can be evaluated on their own, or at
   most need to take into account the values or results of adjacent
   keywords in the same schema object, a few have more complex behavior.

   The lexical scope of a keyword is determined by the nested JSON data
   structure of objects and arrays.  The largest such scope is an entire
   schema document.  The smallest scope is a single schema object with
   no subschemas.

   Keywords MAY be defined with a partial value, such as a URI-
   reference, which must be resolved against another value, such as
   another URI-reference or a full URI, which is found through the
   lexical structure of the JSON document.  The "$id", "$ref", and
   "$dynamicRef" core keywords, and the "base" JSON Hyper-Schema
   keyword, are examples of this sort of behavior.

   Note that some keywords, such as "$schema", apply to the lexical
   scope of the entire schema resource, and therefore MUST only appear
   in a schema resource's root schema.

   Other keywords may take into account the dynamic scope that exists
   during the evaluation of a schema, typically together with an
   instance document.  The outermost dynamic scope is the schema object
   at which processing begins, even if it is not a schema resource root.
   The path from this root schema to any particular keyword (that
   includes any "$ref" and "$dynamicRef" keywords that may have been
   resolved) is considered the keyword's "validation path."





Wright, et al.            Expires June 11, 2021                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                 December 2020


   Lexical and dynamic scopes align until a reference keyword is
   encountered.  While following the reference keyword moves processing
   from one lexical scope into a different one, from the perspective of
   dynamic scope, following a reference is no different from descending
   into a subschema present as a value.  A keyword on the far side of
   that reference that resolves information through the dynamic scope
   will consider the originating side of the reference to be their
   dynamic parent, rather than examining the local lexically enclosing
   parent.

   The concept of dynamic scope is primarily used with "$dynamicRef" and
   "$dynamicAnchor", and should be considered an advanced feature and
   used with caution when defining additional keywords.  It also appears
   when reporting errors and collected annotations, as it may be
   possible to revisit the same lexical scope repeatedly with different
   dynamic scopes.  In such cases, it is important to inform the user of
   the dynamic path that produced the error or annotation.

7.2.  Keyword Interactions

   Keyword behavior MAY be defined in terms of the annotation results of
   subschemas (Section 4.3.5) and/or adjacent keywords (keywords within
   the same schema object) and their subschemas.  Such keywords MUST NOT
   result in a circular dependency.  Keywords MAY modify their behavior
   based on the presence or absence of another keyword in the same
   schema object (Section 4.3).

7.3.  Default Behaviors

   A missing keyword MUST NOT produce a false assertion result, MUST NOT
   produce annotation results, and MUST NOT cause any other schema to be
   evaluated as part of its own behavioral definition.  However, given
   that missing keywords do not contribute annotations, the lack of
   annotation results may indirectly change the behavior of other
   keywords.

   In some cases, the missing keyword assertion behavior of a keyword is
   identical to that produced by a certain value, and keyword
   definitions SHOULD note such values where known.  However, even if
   the value which produces the default behavior would produce
   annotation results if present, the default behavior still MUST NOT
   result in annotations.

   Because annotation collection can add significant cost in terms of
   both computation and memory, implementations MAY opt out of this
   feature.  Keywords that are specified in terms of collected
   annotations SHOULD describe reasonable alternate approaches when




Wright, et al.            Expires June 11, 2021                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                 December 2020


   appropriate.  This approach is demonstrated by the "items" and
   "additionalProperties" keywords in this document.

   Note that when no such alternate approach is possible for a keyword,
   implementations that do not support annotation collections will not
   be able to support those keywords or vocabularies that contain them.

7.4.  Identifiers

   Identifiers set the canonical URI of a schema, or affect how such
   URIs are resolved in references (Section 8.2.3), or both.  The Core
   vocabulary defined in this document defines several identifying
   keywords, most notably "$id".

   Canonical schema URIs MUST NOT change while processing an instance,
   but keywords that affect URI-reference resolution MAY have behavior
   that is only fully determined at runtime.

   While custom identifier keywords are possible, vocabulary designers
   should take care not to disrupt the functioning of core keywords.
   For example, the "$dynamicAnchor" keyword in this specification
   limits its URI resolution effects to the matching "$dynamicRef"
   keyword, leaving the behavior of "$ref" undisturbed.

7.5.  Applicators

   Applicators allow for building more complex schemas than can be
   accomplished with a single schema object.  Evaluation of an instance
   against a schema document (Section 4.3) begins by applying the root
   schema (Section 4.3.5) to the complete instance document.  From
   there, keywords known as applicators are used to determine which
   additional schemas are applied.  Such schemas may be applied in-place
   to the current location, or to a child location.

   The schemas to be applied may be present as subschemas comprising all
   or part of the keyword's value.  Alternatively, an applicator may
   refer to a schema elsewhere in the same schema document, or in a
   different one.  The mechanism for identifying such referenced schemas
   is defined by the keyword.

   Applicator keywords also define how subschema or referenced schema
   boolean assertion (Section 7.6) results are modified and/or combined
   to produce the boolean result of the applicator.  Applicators may
   apply any boolean logic operation to the assertion results of
   subschemas, but MUST NOT introduce new assertion conditions of their
   own.

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                 December 2020


   Annotation (Section 7.7) results are preserved along with the
   instance location and the location of the schema keyword, so that
   applications can decide how to interpret multiple values.

7.5.1.  Referenced and Referencing Schemas

   As noted in Section 7.5, an applicator keyword may refer to a schema
   to be applied, rather than including it as a subschema in the
   applicator's value.  In such situations, the schema being applied is
   known as the referenced schema, while the schema containing the
   applicator keyword is the referencing schema.

   While root schemas and subschemas are static concepts based on a
   schema's position within a schema document, referenced and
   referencing schemas are dynamic.  Different pairs of schemas may find
   themselves in various referenced and referencing arrangements during
   the evaluation of an instance against a schema.

   For some by-reference applicators, such as "$ref" (Section 8.2.3.1),
   the referenced schema can be determined by static analysis of the
   schema document's lexical scope.  Others, such as "$dynamicRef" (with
   "$dynamicAnchor"), may make use of dynamic scoping, and therefore
   only be resolvable in the process of evaluating the schema with an
   instance.

7.6.  Assertions

   JSON Schema can be used to assert constraints on a JSON document,
   which either passes or fails the assertions.  This approach can be
   used to validate conformance with the constraints, or document what
   is needed to satisfy them.

   JSON Schema implementations produce a single boolean result when
   evaluating an instance against schema assertions.

   An instance can only fail an assertion that is present in the schema.

7.6.1.  Assertions and Instance Primitive Types

   Most assertions only constrain values within a certain primitive
   type.  When the type of the instance is not of the type targeted by
   the keyword, the instance is considered to conform to the assertion.

   For example, the "maxLength" keyword from the companion validation
   vocabulary [json-schema-validation]: will only restrict certain
   strings (that are too long) from being valid.  If the instance is a
   number, boolean, null, array, or object, then it is valid against
   this assertion.



Wright, et al.            Expires June 11, 2021                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                 December 2020


   This behavior allows keywords to be used more easily with instances
   that can be of multiple primitive types.  The companion validation
   vocabulary also includes a "type" keyword which can independently
   restrict the instance to one or more primitive types.  This allows
   for a concise expression of use cases such as a function that might
   return either a string of a certain length or a null value:


   {
       "type": ["string", "null"],
       "maxLength": 255
   }


   If "maxLength" also restricted the instance type to be a string, then
   this would be substantially more cumbersome to express because the
   example as written would not actually allow null values.  Each
   keyword is evaluated separately unless explicitly specified
   otherwise, so if "maxLength" restricted the instance to strings, then
   including "null" in "type" would not have any useful effect.

7.7.  Annotations

   JSON Schema can annotate an instance with information, whenever the
   instance validates against the schema object containing the
   annotation, and all of its parent schema objects.  The information
   can be a simple value, or can be calculated based on the instance
   contents.

   Annotations are attached to specific locations in an instance.  Since
   many subschemas can be applied to any single location, applications
   may need to decide how to handle differing annotation values being
   attached to the same instance location by the same schema keyword in
   different schema objects.

   Unlike assertion results, annotation data can take a wide variety of
   forms, which are provided to applications to use as they see fit.
   JSON Schema implementations are not expected to make use of the
   collected information on behalf of applications.

   Unless otherwise specified, the value of an annotation keyword is the
   keyword's value.  However, other behaviors are possible.  For
   example, JSON Hyper-Schema's [json-hyper-schema] "links" keyword is a
   complex annotation that produces a value based in part on the
   instance data.

   While "short-circuit" evaluation is possible for assertions,
   collecting annotations requires examining all schemas that apply to



Wright, et al.            Expires June 11, 2021                [Page 18]

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                 December 2020


   an instance location, even if they cannot change the overall
   assertion result.  The only exception is that subschemas of a schema
   object that has failed validation MAY be skipped, as annotations are
   not retained for failing schemas.

7.7.1.  Collecting Annotations

   Annotations are collected by keywords that explicitly define
   annotation-collecting behavior.  Note that boolean schemas cannot
   produce annotations as they do not make use of keywords.

   A collected annotation MUST include the following information:

      The name of the keyword that produces the annotation

      The instance location to which it is attached, as a JSON Pointer

      The schema location path, indicating how reference keywords such
      as "$ref" were followed to reach the absolute schema location.

      The absolute schema location of the attaching keyword, as a URI.
      This MAY be omitted if it is the same as the schema location path
      from above.

      The attached value(s)

7.7.1.1.  Distinguishing Among Multiple Values

   Applications MAY make decisions on which of multiple annotation
   values to use based on the schema location that contributed the
   value.  This is intended to allow flexible usage.  Collecting the
   schema location facilitates such usage.

   For example, consider this schema, which uses annotations and
   assertions from the Validation specification
   [json-schema-validation]:

   In this example, both Feature A and Feature B make use of the re-
   usable "enabledToggle" schema.  That schema uses the "title",
   "description", and "default" annotations.  Therefore the application
   has to decide how to handle the additional "default" value for
   Feature A, and the additional "description" value for Feature B.

   The application programmer and the schema author need to agree on the
   usage.  For this example, let's assume that they agree that the most
   specific "default" value will be used, and any additional, more
   generic "default" values will be silently ignored.  Let's also assume
   that they agree that all "description" text is to be used, starting
   with the most generic, and ending with the most specific.  This
   requires the schema author to write descriptions that work when
   combined in this way.

   The application can use the schema location path to determine which
   values are which.  The values in the feature's immediate "enabled"
   property schema are more specific, while the values under the re-
   usable schema that is referenced to with "$ref" are more generic.
   The schema location path will show whether each value was found by
   crossing a "$ref" or not.

   Feature A will therefore use a default value of true, while Feature B
   will use the generic default value of null.  Feature A will only have
   the generic description from the "enabledToggle" schema, while
   Feature B will use that description, and also append its locally
   defined description that explains how to interpret a null value.

   Note that there are other reasonable approaches that a different
   application might take.  For example, an application may consider the
   presence of two different values for "default" to be an error,
   regardless of their schema locations.

7.7.1.2.  Annotations and Assertions

   Schema objects that produce a false assertion result MUST NOT produce
   any annotation results, whether from their own keywords or from
   keywords in subschemas.

   Note that the overall schema results may still include annotations
   collected from other schema locations.  Given this schema:

   {
       "oneOf": [
           {
               "title": "Integer Value",
               "type": "integer"
           },
           {
               "title": "String Value",
               "type": "string"
           }
       ]
   }


   Against the instance ""This is a string"", the title annotation
   "Integer Value" is discarded because the type assertion in that
   schema object fails.  The title annotation "String Value" is kept, as
   the instance passes the string type assertions.

7.7.1.3.  Annotations and Applicators

   In addition to possibly defining annotation results of their own,
   applicator keywords aggregate the annotations collected in their
   subschema(s) or referenced schema(s).

7.8.  Reserved Locations

   A fourth category of keywords simply reserve a location to hold re-
   usable components or data of interest to schema authors that is not
   suitable for re-use.  These keywords do not affect validation or
   annotation results.  Their purpose in the core vocabulary is to
   ensure that locations are available for certain purposes and will not
   be redefined by extension keywords.

   While these keywords do not directly affect results, as explained in
   section 9.4.2 unrecognized extension keywords that reserve locations
   for re-usable schemas may have undesirable interactions with
   references in certain circumstances.

7.9.  Loading Instance Data

   While none of the vocabularies defined as part of this or the
   associated documents define a keyword which may target and/or load
   instance data, it is possible that other vocabularies may wish to do
   so.

   Keywords MAY be defined to use JSON Pointers or Relative JSON
   Pointers to examine parts of an instance outside the current
   evaluation location.

   Keywords that allow adjusting the location using a Relative JSON
   Pointer SHOULD default to using the current location if a default is
   desireable.

8.  The JSON Schema Core Vocabulary

   Keywords declared in this section, which all begin with "$", make up
   the JSON Schema Core vocabulary.  These keywords are either required
   in order to process any schema or meta-schema, including those split
   across multiple documents, or exist to reserve keywords for purposes
   that require guaranteed interoperability.

   The Core vocabulary MUST be considered mandatory at all times, in
   order to bootstrap the processing of further vocabularies.  Meta-
   schemas that use the "$vocabulary" (Section 8.1) keyword to declare
   the vocabularies in use MUST explicitly list the Core vocabulary,
   which MUST have a value of true indicating that it is required.

   The behavior of a false value for this vocabulary (and only this
   vocabulary) is undefined, as is the behavior when "$vocabulary" is
   present but the Core vocabulary is not included.  However, it is
   RECOMMENDED that implementations detect these cases and raise an
   error when they occur.  It is not meaningful to declare that a meta-
   schema optionally uses Core.

   Meta-schemas that do not use "$vocabulary" MUST be considered to
   require the Core vocabulary as if its URI were present with a value
   of true.

   The current URI for the Core vocabulary is: <https://json-schema.org/
   draft/2020-12/vocab/core>.

   The current URI for the corresponding meta-schema is: <https://json-
   schema.org/draft/2020-12/meta/core>.

   While the "$" prefix is not formally reserved for the Core
   vocabulary, it is RECOMMENDED that extension keywords (in
   vocabularies or otherwise) begin with a character other than "$" to
   avoid possible future collisions.

8.1.  Meta-Schemas and Vocabularies

   Two concepts, meta-schemas and vocabularies, are used to inform an
   implementation how to interpret a schema.  Every schema has a meta-
   schema, which can be declared using the "$schema" keyword.

   The meta-schema serves two purposes:

   Declaring the vocabularies in use  The "$vocabulary" keyword, when it
      appears in a meta-schema, declares which vocabularies are
      available to be used in schemas that refer to that meta-schema.
      Vocabularies define keyword semantics, as well as their general
      syntax.

   Describing valid schema syntax  A schema MUST successfully validate
      against its meta-schema, which constrains the syntax of the
      available keywords.  The syntax described is expected to be
      compatible with the vocabularies declared; while it is possible to
      describe an incompatible syntax, such a meta-schema would be
      unlikely to be useful.

   Meta-schemas are separate from vocabularies to allow for vocabularies
   to be combined in different ways, and for meta-schema authors to
   impose additional constraints such as forbidding certain keywords, or
   performing unusually strict syntactical validation, as might be done
   during a development and testing cycle.  Each vocabulary typically
   identifies a meta-schema consisting only of the vocabulary's
   keywords.

   Meta-schema authoring is an advanced usage of JSON Schema, so the
   design of meta-schema features emphasizes flexibility over
   simplicity.

8.1.1.  The "$schema" Keyword

   The "$schema" keyword is both used as a JSON Schema dialect
   identifier and as the identifier of a resource which is itself a JSON
   Schema, which describes the set of valid schemas written for this
   particular dialect.

   The value of this keyword MUST be a URI [RFC3986] (containing a
   scheme) and this URI MUST be normalized.  The current schema MUST be
   valid against the meta-schema identified by this URI.

   If this URI identifies a retrievable resource, that resource SHOULD
   be of media type "application/schema+json".





Wright, et al.            Expires June 11, 2021                [Page 24]

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                 December 2020


   The "$schema" keyword SHOULD be used in the document root schema
   object, and MAY be used in the root schema objects of embedded schema
   resources.  It MUST NOT appear in non-resource root schema objects.
   If absent from the document root schema, the resulting behavior is
   implementation-defined.

   Values for this property are defined elsewhere in this and other
   documents, and by other parties.

8.1.2.  The "$vocabulary" Keyword

   The "$vocabulary" keyword is used in meta-schemas to identify the
   vocabularies available for use in schemas described by that meta-
   schema.  It is also used to indicate whether each vocabulary is
   required or optional, in the sense that an implementation MUST
   understand the required vocabularies in order to successfully process
   the schema.  Together, this information forms a dialect.  Any
   vocabulary that is understood by the implementation MUST be processed
   in a manner consistent with the semantic definitions contained within
   the vocabulary.

   The value of this keyword MUST be an object.  The property names in
   the object MUST be URIs (containing a scheme) and this URI MUST be
   normalized.  Each URI that appears as a property name identifies a
   specific set of keywords and their semantics.

   The URI MAY be a URL, but the nature of the retrievable resource is
   currently undefined, and reserved for future use.  Vocabulary authors
   MAY use the URL of the vocabulary specification, in a human-readable
   media type such as text/html or text/plain, as the vocabulary URI.
   [[CREF1: Vocabulary documents may be added in forthcoming drafts.
   For now, identifying the keyword set is deemed sufficient as that,
   along with meta-schema validation, is how the current "vocabularies"
   work today.  Any future vocabulary document format will be specified
   as a JSON document, so using text/html or other non-JSON formats in
   the meantime will not produce any future ambiguity.  ]]

   The values of the object properties MUST be booleans.  If the value
   is true, then implementations that do not recognize the vocabulary
   MUST refuse to process any schemas that declare this meta-schema with
   "$schema".  If the value is false, implementations that do not
   recognize the vocabulary SHOULD proceed with processing such schemas.
   The value has no impact if the implementation understands the
   vocabulary.

   Per 6.5, unrecognized keywords SHOULD be treated as annotations.
   This remains the case for keywords defined by unrecognized
   vocabularies.  It is not currently possible to distinguish between

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                 December 2020


   unrecognized keywords that are defined in vocabularies from those
   that are not part of any vocabulary.

   The "$vocabulary" keyword SHOULD be used in the root schema of any
   schema document intended for use as a meta-schema.  It MUST NOT
   appear in subschemas.

   The "$vocabulary" keyword MUST be ignored in schema documents that
   are not being processed as a meta-schema.  This allows validating a
   meta-schema M against its own meta-schema M' without requiring the
   validator to understand the vocabularies declared by M.

8.1.2.1.  Default vocabularies

   If "$vocabulary" is absent, an implementation MAY determine behavior
   based on the meta-schema if it is recognized from the URI value of
   the referring schema's "$schema" keyword.  This is how behavior (such
   as Hyper-Schema usage) has been recognized prior to the existence of
   vocabularies.

   If the meta-schema, as referenced by the schema, is not recognized,
   or is missing, then the behavior is implementation-defined.  If the
   implementation proceeds with processing the schema, it MUST assume
   the use of the core vocabulary.  If the implementation is built for a
   specific purpose, then it SHOULD assume the use of all of the most
   relevant vocabularies for that purpose.

   For example, an implementation that is a validator SHOULD assume the
   use of all vocabularies in this specification and the companion
   Validation specification.

8.1.2.2.  Non-inheritability of vocabularies

   Note that the processing restrictions on "$vocabulary" mean that
   meta-schemas that reference other meta-schemas using "$ref" or
   similar keywords do not automatically inherit the vocabulary
   declarations of those other meta-schemas.  All such declarations must
   be repeated in the root of each schema document intended for use as a
   meta-schema.  This is demonstrated in the example meta-schema
   (Appendix D.2).  [[CREF2: This requirement allows implementations to
   find all vocabulary requirement information in a single place for
   each meta-schema.  As schema extensibility means that there are
   endless potential ways to combine more fine-grained meta-schemas by
   reference, requiring implementations to anticipate all possibilities
   and search for vocabularies in referenced meta-schemas would be
   overly burdensome.  ]]

8.1.3.  Updates to Meta-Schema and Vocabulary URIs

   Updated vocabulary and meta-schema URIs MAY be published between
   specification drafts in order to correct errors.  Implementations
   SHOULD consider URIs dated after this specification draft and before
   the next to indicate the same syntax and semantics as those listed
   here.

8.2.  Base URI, Anchors, and Dereferencing

   To differentiate between schemas in a vast ecosystem, schemas are
   identified by URI [RFC3986], and can embed references to other
   schemas by specifying their URI.

   Several keywords can accept a relative URI-reference [RFC3986], or a
   value used to construct a relative URI-reference.  For these
   keywords, it is necessary to establish a base URI in order to resolve
   the reference.

8.2.1.  The "$id" Keyword

   The "$id" keyword identifies a schema resource with its canonical
   [RFC6596] URI.

   Note that this URI is an identifier and not necessarily a network
   locator.  In the case of a network-addressable URL, a schema need not
   be downloadable from its canonical URI.

   If present, the value for this keyword MUST be a string, and MUST
   represent a valid URI-reference [RFC3986].  This URI-reference SHOULD
   be normalized, and MUST resolve to an absolute-URI [RFC3986] (without
   a fragment).  Therefore, "$id" MUST NOT contain a non-empty fragment,
   and SHOULD NOT contain an empty fragment.

   Since an empty fragment in the context of the application/schema+json
   media type refers to the same resource as the base URI without a
   fragment, an implementation MAY normalize a URI ending with an empty
   fragment by removing the fragment.  However, schema authors SHOULD
   NOT rely on this behavior across implementations.  [[CREF3: This is
   primarily allowed because older meta-schemas have an empty fragment
   in their $id (or previously, id).  A future draft may outright forbid
   even empty fragments in "$id".  ]]

   This URI also serves as the base URI for relative URI-references in
   keywords within the schema resource, in accordance with RFC 3986
   section 5.1.1 [RFC3986] regarding base URIs embedded in content.





Wright, et al.            Expires June 11, 2021                [Page 27]

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                 December 2020


   The presence of "$id" in a subschema indicates that the subschema
   constitutes a distinct schema resource within a single schema
   document.  Furthermore, in accordance with RFC 3986 section 5.1.2
   [RFC3986] regarding encapsulating entities, if an "$id" in a
   subschema is a relative URI-reference, the base URI for resolving
   that reference is the URI of the parent schema resource.

   If no parent schema object explicitly identifies itself as a resource
   with "$id", the base URI is that of the entire document, as
   established by the steps given in the previous section.
   (Section 9.1.1)

8.2.1.1.  Identifying the root schema

   The root schema of a JSON Schema document SHOULD contain an "$id"
   keyword with an absolute-URI [RFC3986] (containing a scheme, but no
   fragment).

8.2.2.  Defining location-independent identifiers

   Using JSON Pointer fragments requires knowledge of the structure of
   the schema.  When writing schema documents with the intention to
   provide re-usable schemas, it may be preferable to use a plain name
   fragment that is not tied to any particular structural location.
   This allows a subschema to be relocated without requiring JSON
   Pointer references to be updated.

   The "$anchor" and "$dynamicAnchor" keywords are used to specify such
   fragments.  They are identifier keywords that can only be used to
   create plain name fragments, rather than absolute URIs as seen with
   "$id".

   The base URI to which the resulting fragment is appended is the
   canonical URI of the schema resource containing the "$anchor" or
   "$dynamicAnchor" in question.  As discussed in the previous section,
   this is either the nearest "$id" in the same or parent schema object,
   or the base URI for the document as determined according to RFC 3986.

   Separately from the usual usage of URIs, "$dynamicAnchor" indicates
   that the fragment is an extension point when used with the
   "$dynamicRef" keyword.  This low-level, advanced feature makes it
   easier to extend recursive schemas such as the meta-schemas, without
   imposing any particular semantics on that extension.  See the section
   on "$dynamicRef" (Section 8.2.3.2) for details.

   In most cases, the normal fragment behavior both suffices and is more
   intuitive.  Therefore it is RECOMMENDED that "$anchor" be used to




Wright, et al.            Expires June 11, 2021                [Page 28]

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                 December 2020


   create plain name fragments unless there is a clear need for
   "$dynamicAnchor".

   If present, the value of this keyword MUST be a string and MUST start
   with a letter ([A-Za-z]) or underscore ("_"), followed by any number
   of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), and
   periods (".").  This matches the US-ASCII part of XML's NCName
   production [xml-names].  [[CREF4: Note that the anchor string does
   not include the "#" character, as it is not a URI-reference.  An
   "$anchor": "foo" becomes the fragment "#foo" when used in a URI.  See
   below for full examples.  ]]

   The effect of specifying the same fragment name multiple times within
   the same resource, using any combination of "$anchor" and/or
   "$dynamicAnchor", is undefined.  Implementations MAY raise an error
   if such usage is detected.

8.2.3.  Schema References

   Several keywords can be used to reference a schema which is to be
   applied to the current instance location. "$ref" and "$dynamicRef"
   are applicator keywords, applying the referenced schema to the
   instance.

   As the values of "$ref" and "$dynamicRef" are URI References, this
   allows the possibility to externalise or divide a schema across
   multiple files, and provides the ability to validate recursive
   structures through self-reference.

   The resolved URI produced by these keywords is not necessarily a
   network locator, only an identifier.  A schema need not be
   downloadable from the address if it is a network-addressable URL, and
   implementations SHOULD NOT assume they should perform a network
   operation when they encounter a network-addressable URI.

8.2.3.1.  Direct References with "$ref"

   The "$ref" keyword is an applicator that is used to reference a
   statically identified schema.  Its results are the results of the
   referenced schema.  [[CREF5: Note that this definition of how the
   results are determined means that other keywords can appear alongside
   of "$ref" in the same schema object.  ]]

   The value of the "$ref" keyword MUST be a string which is a URI-
   Reference.  Resolved against the current URI base, it produces the
   URI of the schema to apply.  This resolution is safe to perform on
   schema load, as the process of evaluating an instance cannot change
   how the reference resolves.

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                 December 2020


8.2.3.2.  Dynamic References with "$dynamicRef"

   The "$dynamicRef" keyword is an applicator that allows for deferring
   the full resolution until runtime, at which point it is resolved each
   time it is encountered while evaluating an instance.

   Together with "$dynamicAnchor", "$dynamicRef" implements a
   cooperative extension mechanism that is primarily useful with
   recursive schemas (schemas that reference themselves).  Both the
   extension point and the runtime-determined extension target are
   defined with "$dynamicAnchor", and only exhibit runtime dynamic
   behavior when referenced with "$dynamicRef".

   The value of the "$dynamicRef" property MUST be a string which is a
   URI-Reference.  Resolved against the current URI base, it produces
   the URI used as the starting point for runtime resolution.  This
   initial resolution is safe to perform on schema load.

   If the initially resolved starting point URI includes a fragment that
   was created by the "$dynamicAnchor" keyword, the initial URI MUST be
   replaced by the URI (including the fragment) for the outermost schema
   resource in the dynamic scope (Section 7.1) that defines an
   identically named fragment with "$dynamicAnchor".

   Otherwise, its behavior is identical to "$ref", and no runtime
   resolution is needed.

   For a full example using these keyword, see appendix C.  [[CREF6: The
   difference between the hyper-schema meta-schema in pre-2019 drafts
   and an this draft dramatically demonstrates the utility of these
   keywords.  ]]

8.2.4.  Schema Re-Use With "$defs"

   The "$defs" keyword reserves a location for schema authors to inline
   re-usable JSON Schemas into a more general schema.  The keyword does
   not directly affect the validation result.

   This keyword's value MUST be an object.  Each member value of this
   object MUST be a valid JSON Schema.

   As an example, here is a schema describing an array of positive
   integers, where the positive integer constraint is a subschema in
   "$defs":

   {
       "type": "array",
       "items": { "$ref": "#/$defs/positiveInteger" },
       "$defs": {
           "positiveInteger": {
               "type": "integer",
               "exclusiveMinimum": 0
           }
       }
   }


8.3.  Comments With "$comment"

   This keyword reserves a location for comments from schema authors to
   readers or maintainers of the schema.

   The value of this keyword MUST be a string.  Implementations MUST NOT
   present this string to end users.  Tools for editing schemas SHOULD
   support displaying and editing this keyword.  The value of this
   keyword MAY be used in debug or error output which is intended for
   developers making use of schemas.

   Schema vocabularies SHOULD allow "$comment" within any object
   containing vocabulary keywords.  Implementations MAY assume
   "$comment" is allowed unless the vocabulary specifically forbids it.
   Vocabularies MUST NOT specify any effect of "$comment" beyond what is
   described in this specification.

   Tools that translate other media types or programming languages to
   and from application/schema+json MAY choose to convert that media
   type or programming language's native comments to or from "$comment"
   values.  The behavior of such translation when both native comments
   and "$comment" properties are present is implementation-dependent.

   Implementations MAY strip "$comment" values at any point during
   processing.  In particular, this allows for shortening schemas when
   the size of deployed schemas is a concern.

   Implementations MUST NOT take any other action based on the presence,
   absence, or contents of "$comment" properties.  In particular, the
   value of "$comment" MUST NOT be collected as an annotation result.

9.1.  Loading a Schema

9.1.1.  Initial Base URI

   RFC3986 Section 5.1 [RFC3986] defines how to determine the default
   base URI of a document.

   Informatively, the initial base URI of a schema is the URI at which
   it was found, whether that was a network location, a local
   filesystem, or any other situation identifiable by a URI of any known
   scheme.

   If a schema document defines no explicit base URI with "$id"
   (embedded in content), the base URI is that determined per RFC 3986
   section 5 [RFC3986].

   If no source is known, or no URI scheme is known for the source, a
   suitable implementation-specific default URI MAY be used as described
   in RFC 3986 Section 5.1.4 [RFC3986].  It is RECOMMENDED that
   implementations document any default base URI that they assume.

   If a schema object is embedded in a document of another media type,
   then the initial base URI is determined according to the rules of
   that media type.

   Unless the "$id" keyword described in the next section is present in
   the root schema, this base URI SHOULD be considered the canonical URI
   of the schema document's root schema resource.

9.1.2.  Loading a referenced schema

   The use of URIs to identify remote schemas does not necessarily mean
   anything is downloaded, but instead JSON Schema implementations
   SHOULD understand ahead of time which schemas they will be using, and
   the URIs that identify them.

   When schemas are downloaded, for example by a generic user-agent that
   does not know until runtime which schemas to download, see Usage for
   Hypermedia (Section 9.5.1).

   Implementations SHOULD be able to associate arbitrary URIs with an
   arbitrary schema and/or automatically associate a schema's "$id"-
   given URI, depending on the trust that the validator has in the
   schema.  Such URIs and schemas can be supplied to an implementation
   prior to processing instances, or may be noted within a schema
   document as it is processed, producing associations as shown in
   appendix A.

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                 December 2020


   A schema MAY (and likely will) have multiple URIs, but there is no
   way for a URI to identify more than one schema.  When multiple
   schemas try to identify as the same URI, validators SHOULD raise an
   error condition.

9.1.3.  Detecting a Meta-Schema

   Implementations MUST recognize a schema as a meta-schema if it is
   being examined because it was identified as such by another schema's
   "$schema" keyword.  This means that a single schema document might
   sometimes be considered a regular schema, and other times be
   considered a meta-schema.

   In the case of examining a schema which is its own meta-schema, when
   an implementation begins processing it as a regular schema, it is
   processed under those rules.  However, when loaded a second time as a
   result of checking its own "$schema" value, it is treated as a meta-
   schema.  So the same document is processed both ways in the course of
   one session.

   Implementations MAY allow a schema to be explicitly passed as a meta-
   schema, for implementation-specific purposes, such as pre-loading a
   commonly used meta-schema and checking its vocabulary support
   requirements up front.  Meta-schema authors MUST NOT expect such
   features to be interoperable across implementations.

9.2.  Dereferencing

   Schemas can be identified by any URI that has been given to them,
   including a JSON Pointer or their URI given directly by "$id".  In
   all cases, dereferencing a "$ref" reference involves first resolving
   its value as a URI reference against the current base URI per RFC
   3986 [RFC3986].

   If the resulting URI identifies a schema within the current document,
   or within another schema document that has been made available to the
   implementation, then that schema SHOULD be used automatically.

   For example, consider this schema:












Wright, et al.            Expires June 11, 2021                [Page 33]

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                 December 2020


   {
       "$id": "https://example.net/root.json",
       "items": {
           "type": "array",
           "items": { "$ref": "#item" }
       },
       "$defs": {
           "single": {
               "$anchor": "item",
               "type": "object",
               "additionalProperties": { "$ref": "other.json" }
           }
       }
   }


   When an implementation encounters the <#/$defs/single> schema, it
   resolves the "$anchor" value as a fragment name against the current
   base URI to form <https://example.net/root.json#item>.

   When an implementation then looks inside the <#/items> schema, it
   encounters the <#item> reference, and resolves this to
   <https://example.net/root.json#item>, which it has seen defined in
   this same document and can therefore use automatically.

   When an implementation encounters the reference to "other.json", it
   resolves this to <https://example.net/other.json>, which is not
   defined in this document.  If a schema with that identifier has
   otherwise been supplied to the implementation, it can also be used
   automatically.  [[CREF7: What should implementations do when the
   referenced schema is not known?  Are there circumstances in which
   automatic network dereferencing is allowed?  A same origin policy?  A
   user-configurable option?  In the case of an evolving API described
   by Hyper-Schema, it is expected that new schemas will be added to the
   system dynamically, so placing an absolute requirement of pre-loading
   schema documents is not feasible.  ]]

9.2.1.  JSON Pointer fragments and embedded schema resources

   Since JSON Pointer URI fragments are constructed based on the
   structure of the schema document, an embedded schema resource and its
   subschemas can be identified by JSON Pointer fragments relative to
   either its own canonical URI, or relative to the containing
   resource's URI.

   Conceptually, a set of linked schema resources should behave
   identically whether each resource is a separate document connected




Wright, et al.            Expires June 11, 2021                [Page 34]

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                 December 2020


   with schema references (Section 8.2.3), or is structured as a single
   document with one or more schema resources embedded as subschemas.

   Since URIs involving JSON Pointer fragments relative to the parent
   schema resource's URI cease to be valid when the embedded schema is
   moved to a separate document and referenced, applications and schemas
   SHOULD NOT use such URIs to identify embedded schema resources or
   locations within them.

   Consider the following schema document that contains another schema
   resource embedded within it:


   {
       "$id": "https://example.com/foo",
       "items": {
           "$id": "https://example.com/bar",
           "additionalProperties": { }
       }
   }


   The URI "https://example.com/foo#/items/additionalProperties" points
   to the schema of the "additionalProperties" keyword in the embedded
   resource.  The canonical URI of that schema, however, is
   "https://example.com/bar#/additionalProperties".

   Now consider the following two schema resources linked by reference
   using a URI value for "$ref":


   {
       "$id": "https://example.com/foo",
       "items": {
           "$ref": "bar"
       }
   }

   {
       "$id": "https://example.com/bar",
       "additionalProperties": { }
   }


   Here we see that the canonical URI for that "additionalProperties"
   subschema is still valid, while the non-canonical URI with the
   fragment beginning with "#/items/$ref" now resolves to nothing.




Wright, et al.            Expires June 11, 2021                [Page 35]

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                 December 2020


   Note also that "https://example.com/foo#/items" is valid in both
   arrangements, but resolves to a different value.  This URI ends up
   functioning similarly to a retrieval URI for a resource.  While
   valid, examining the resolved value and either using the "$id" (if
   the value is a subschema), or resolving the reference and using the
   "$id" of the reference target, is preferable.

   An implementation MAY choose not to support addressing schemas by
   non-canonical URIs.  As such, it is RECOMMENDED that schema authors
   only use canonical URIs, as using non-canonical URIs may reduce
   schema interoperability.  [[CREF8: This is to avoid requiring
   implementations to keep track of a whole stack of possible base URIs
   and JSON Pointer fragments for each, given that all but one will be
   fragile if the schema resources are reorganized.  Some have argued
   that this is easy so there is no point in forbidding it, while others
   have argued that it complicates schema identification and should be
   forbidden.  Feedback on this topic is encouraged.  ]]

   Further examples of such non-canonical URIs, as well as the
   appropriate canonical URIs to use instead, are provided in appendix
   A.

9.3.  Compound Documents

   A Compound Schema Document is defined as a JSON document (sometimes
   called a "bundled" schema) which has multiple embedded JSON Schema
   Resources bundled into the same document to ease transportation.

   Each embedded Schema Resource MUST be treated as an individual Schema
   Resource, following standard schema loading and processing
   requirements, including determining vocabulary support.

9.3.1.  Bundling

   The bundling process for creating a Compound Schema Document is
   defined as taking references (such as "$ref") to an external Schema
   Resource and embedding the referenced Schema Resources within the
   referring document.  Bundling SHOULD be done in such a way that all
   URIs (used for referencing) in the base document and any referenced/
   embedded documents do not require altering.

   Each embedded JSON Schema Resource MUST identify itself with a URI
   using the "$id" keyword, and SHOULD make use of the "$schema" keyword
   to identify the dialect it is using, in the root of the schema
   resource.  It is RECOMMENDED that the URI identifier value of "$id"
   be an Absolute URI.





Wright, et al.            Expires June 11, 2021                [Page 36]

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                 December 2020


   When the Schema Resource referenced by a by-reference applicator is
   bundled, it is RECOMMENDED that the Schema Resource be located as a
   value of a "$defs" object at the containing schema's root.  The key
   of the "$defs" for the now embedded Schema Resource MAY be the "$id"
   of the bundled schema or some other form of application defined
   unique identifer (such as a UUID).  This key is not intended to be
   referenced in JSON Schema, but may be used by an application to aid
   the bundling process.

   A Schema Resource MAY be embedded in a location other than "$defs"
   where the location is defined as a schema value.

   A Bundled Schema Resource MUST NOT be bundled by replacing the schema
   object from which it was referenced, or by wrapping the Schema
   Resource in other applicator keywords.

   In order to produce identical output, references in the containing
   schema document to the previously external Schema Resources MUST NOT
   be changed, and now resolve to a schema using the "$id" of an
   embedded Schema Resource.  Such identical output includes validation
   evaluation and URIs or paths used in resulting annotations or errors.

   While the bundling process will often be the main method for creating
   a Compound Schema Document, it is also possible and expected that
   some will be created by hand, potentially without individual Schema
   Resources existing on their own previously.

9.3.2.  Differing and Default Dialects

   When multiple schema resources are present in a single document,
   schema resources which do not define with which dialect they should
   be processed MUST be processed with the same dialect as the enclosing
   resource.

   Since any schema that can be referenced can also be embedded,
   embedded schema resources MAY specify different processing dialects
   using the "$schema" values from their enclosing resource.

9.3.3.  Validating

   Given that a Compound Schema Document may have embedded resources
   which identify as using different dialects, these documents SHOULD
   NOT be validated by applying a meta-schema to the Compound Schema
   Document as an instance.  It is RECOMMENDED that an alternate
   validation process be provided in order to validate Schema Documents.
   Each Schema Resource SHOULD be separately validated against its
   associated meta-schema.  [[CREF9: If you know a schema is what's
   being validated, you can identify if the schemas is a Compound Schema



Wright, et al.            Expires June 11, 2021                [Page 37]

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                 December 2020


   Document or not, by way of use of "$id", which identifies an embedded
   resource when used not at the document's root.  ]]

   A Compound Schema Document in which all embedded resources identify
   as using the same dialect, or in which "$schema" is omitted and
   therefore defaults to that of the enclosing resource, MAY be
   validated by applying the appropriate meta-schema.

9.4.  Caveats

9.4.1.  Guarding Against Infinite Recursion

   A schema MUST NOT be run into an infinite loop against an instance.
   For example, if two schemas "#alice" and "#bob" both have an "allOf"
   property that refers to the other, a naive validator might get stuck
   in an infinite recursive loop trying to validate the instance.
   Schemas SHOULD NOT make use of infinite recursive nesting like this;
   the behavior is undefined.

9.4.2.  References to Possible Non-Schemas

   Subschema objects (or booleans) are recognized by their use with
   known applicator keywords or with location-reserving keywords such as
   "$defs" (Section 8.2.4) that take one or more subschemas as a value.
   These keywords may be "$defs" and the standard applicators from this
   document, or extension keywords from a known vocabulary, or
   implementation-specific custom keywords.

   Multi-level structures of unknown keywords are capable of introducing
   nested subschemas, which would be subject to the processing rules for
   "$id".  Therefore, having a reference target in such an unrecognized
   structure cannot be reliably implemented, and the resulting behavior
   is undefined.  Similarly, a reference target under a known keyword,
   for which the value is known not to be a schema, results in undefined
   behavior in order to avoid burdening implementations with the need to
   detect such targets.  [[CREF10: These scenarios are analogous to
   fetching a schema over HTTP but receiving a response with a Content-
   Type other than application/schema+json.  An implementation can
   certainly try to interpret it as a schema, but the origin server
   offered no guarantee that it actually is any such thing.  Therefore,
   interpreting it as such has security implications and may produce
   unpredictable results.  ]]

   Note that single-level custom keywords with identical syntax and
   semantics to "$defs" do not allow for any intervening "$id" keywords,
   and therefore will behave correctly under implementations that
   attempt to use any reference target as a schema.  However, this




Wright, et al.            Expires June 11, 2021                [Page 38]

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                 December 2020


   behavior is implementation-specific and MUST NOT be relied upon for
   interoperability.

9.5.  Associating Instances and Schemas

9.5.1.  Usage for Hypermedia

   JSON has been adopted widely by HTTP servers for automated APIs and
   robots.  This section describes how to enhance processing of JSON
   documents in a more RESTful manner when used with protocols that
   support media types and Web linking [RFC8288].

9.5.1.1.  Linking to a Schema

   It is RECOMMENDED that instances described by a schema provide a link
   to a downloadable JSON Schema using the link relation "describedby",
   as defined by Linked Data Protocol 1.0, section 8.1
   [W3C.REC-ldp-20150226].

   In HTTP, such links can be attached to any response using the Link
   header [RFC8288].  An example of such a header would be:


          Link: <https://example.com/my-hyper-schema>; rel="describedby"


9.5.1.2.  Usage Over HTTP

   When used for hypermedia systems over a network, HTTP [RFC7231] is
   frequently the protocol of choice for distributing schemas.
   Misbehaving clients can pose problems for server maintainers if they
   pull a schema over the network more frequently than necessary, when
   it's instead possible to cache a schema for a long period of time.

   HTTP servers SHOULD set long-lived caching headers on JSON Schemas.
   HTTP clients SHOULD observe caching headers and not re-request
   documents within their freshness period.  Distributed systems SHOULD
   make use of a shared cache and/or caching proxy.

   Clients SHOULD set or prepend a User-Agent header specific to the
   JSON Schema implementation or software product.  Since symbols are
   listed in decreasing order of significance, the JSON Schema library
   name/version should precede the more generic HTTP library name (if
   any).  For example:


        User-Agent: product-name/5.4.1 so-cool-json-schema/1.0.2 curl/7.43.0




Wright, et al.            Expires June 11, 2021                [Page 39]

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                 December 2020


   Clients SHOULD be able to make requests with a "From" header so that
   server operators can contact the owner of a potentially misbehaving
   script.

10.  A Vocabulary for Applying Subschemas

   This section defines a vocabulary of applicator keywords that are
   RECOMMENDED for use as the basis of other vocabularies.

   Meta-schemas that do not use "$vocabulary" SHOULD be considered to
   require this vocabulary as if its URI were present with a value of
   true.

   The current URI for this vocabulary, known as the Applicator
   vocabulary, is: <https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/vocab/
   applicator>.

   The current URI for the corresponding meta-schema is: <https://json-
   schema.org/draft/2020-12/meta/applicator>.

   Updated vocabulary and meta-schema URIs MAY be published between
   specification drafts in order to correct errors.  Implementations
   SHOULD consider URIs dated after this specification draft and before
   the next to indicate the same syntax and semantics as those listed
   here.

10.1.  Keyword Independence

   Schema keywords typically operate independently, without affecting
   each other's outcomes.

   For schema author convenience, there are some exceptions among the
   keywords in this vocabulary:

      "additionalProperties", whose behavior is defined in terms of
      "properties" and "patternProperties"

      "items", whose behavior is defined in terms of "prefixItems"

      "contains", whose behavior is defined in terms of "minContains"

10.2.  Keywords for Applying Subschemas in Place

   These keywords apply subschemas to the same location in the instance
   as the parent schema is being applied.  They allow combining or
   modifying the subschema results in various ways.





Wright, et al.            Expires June 11, 2021                [Page 40]

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                 December 2020


   Subschemas of these keywords evaluate the instance completely
   independently such that the results of one such subschema MUST NOT
   impact the results of sibling subschemas.  Therefore subschemas may
   be applied in any order.

10.2.1.  Keywords for Applying Subschemas With Logic

   These keywords correspond to logical operators for combining or
   modifying the boolean assertion results of the subschemas.  They have
   no direct impact on annotation collection, although they enable the
   same annotation keyword to be applied to an instance location with
   different values.  Annotation keywords define their own rules for
   combining such values.

10.2.1.1.  allOf

   This keyword's value MUST be a non-empty array.  Each item of the
   array MUST be a valid JSON Schema.

   An instance validates successfully against this keyword if it
   validates successfully against all schemas defined by this keyword's
   value.

10.2.1.2.  anyOf

   This keyword's value MUST be a non-empty array.  Each item of the
   array MUST be a valid JSON Schema.

   An instance validates successfully against this keyword if it
   validates successfully against at least one schema defined by this
   keyword's value.  Note that when annotations are being collected, all
   subschemas MUST be examined so that annotations are collected from
   each subschema that validates successfully.

10.2.1.3.  oneOf

   This keyword's value MUST be a non-empty array.  Each item of the
   array MUST be a valid JSON Schema.

   An instance validates successfully against this keyword if it
   validates successfully against exactly one schema defined by this
   keyword's value.

10.2.1.4.  not

   This keyword's value MUST be a valid JSON Schema.

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                 December 2020


   An instance is valid against this keyword if it fails to validate
   successfully against the schema defined by this keyword.

10.2.2.  Keywords for Applying Subschemas Conditionally

   Three of these keywords work together to implement conditional
   application of a subschema based on the outcome of another subschema.
   The fourth is a shortcut for a specific conditional case.

   "if", "then", and "else" MUST NOT interact with each other across
   subschema boundaries.  In other words, an "if" in one branch of an
   "allOf" MUST NOT have an impact on a "then" or "else" in another
   branch.

   There is no default behavior for "if", "then", or "else" when they
   are not present.  In particular, they MUST NOT be treated as if
   present with an empty schema, and when "if" is not present, both
   "then" and "else" MUST be entirely ignored.

10.2.2.1.  if

   This keyword's value MUST be a valid JSON Schema.

   This validation outcome of this keyword's subschema has no direct
   effect on the overall validation result.  Rather, it controls which
   of the "then" or "else" keywords are evaluated.

   Instances that successfully validate against this keyword's subschema
   MUST also be valid against the subschema value of the "then" keyword,
   if present.

   Instances that fail to validate against this keyword's subschema MUST
   also be valid against the subschema value of the "else" keyword, if
   present.

   If annotations (Section 7.7) are being collected, they are collected
   from this keyword's subschema in the usual way, including when the
   keyword is present without either "then" or "else".

10.2.2.2.  then

   This keyword's value MUST be a valid JSON Schema.

   When "if" is present, and the instance successfully validates against
   its subschema, then validation succeeds against this keyword if the
   instance also successfully validates against this keyword's
   subschema.

   This keyword has no effect when "if" is absent, or when the instance
   fails to validate against its subschema.  Implementations MUST NOT
   evaluate the instance against this keyword, for either validation or
   annotation collection purposes, in such cases.

10.2.2.3.  else

   This keyword's value MUST be a valid JSON Schema.

   When "if" is present, and the instance fails to validate against its
   subschema, then validation succeeds against this keyword if the
   instance successfully validates against this keyword's subschema.

   This keyword has no effect when "if" is absent, or when the instance
   successfully validates against its subschema.  Implementations MUST
   NOT evaluate the instance against this keyword, for either validation
   or annotation collection purposes, in such cases.

10.2.2.4.  dependentSchemas

   This keyword specifies subschemas that are evaluated if the instance
   is an object and contains a certain property.

   This keyword's value MUST be an object.  Each value in the object
   MUST be a valid JSON Schema.

   If the object key is a property in the instance, the entire instance
   must validate against the subschema.  Its use is dependent on the
   presence of the property.

   Omitting this keyword has the same behavior as an empty object.

10.3.  Keywords for Applying Subschemas to Child Instances

   Each of these keywords defines a rule for applying its subschema(s)
   to child instances, specifically object properties and array items,
   and combining their results.

10.3.1.  Keywords for Applying Subschemas to Arrays

10.3.1.1.  prefixItems

   The value of "prefixItems" MUST be a non-empty array of valid JSON
   Schemas.

   Validation succeeds if each element of the instance validates against
   the schema at the same position, if any.  This keyword does not
   constrain the length of the array.  If the array is longer than this

   keyword's value, this keyword validates only the prefix of matching
   length.

   This keyword produces an annotation value which is the largest index
   to which this keyword applied a subschema.  The value MAY be a
   boolean true if a subschema was applied to every index of the
   instance, such as is produced by the "items" keyword.  This
   annotation affects the behavior of "items" and "unevaluatedItems".

   Omitting this keyword has the same assertion behavior as an empty
   array.

10.3.1.2.  items

   The value of "items" MUST be a valid JSON Schema.

   This keyword applies its subschema to all instance elements at
   indexes greater than the length of the "prefixItems" array in the
   same schema object, as reported by the annotation result of that
   "prefixItems" keyword.  If no such annotation result exists, "items"
   applies its subschema to all instance array elements.  [[CREF11: Note
   that the behavior of "items" without "prefixItems" is identical to
   that of the schema form of "items" in prior drafts.  When
   "prefixItems" is present, the behavior of "items" is identical to the
   former "additionalItems" keyword.  ]]

   If the "items" subschema is applied to any positions within the
   instance array, it produces an annotation result of boolean true,
   indicating that all remaining array elements have been evaluated
   against this keyword's subschema.

   Omitting this keyword has the same assertion behavior as an empty
   schema.

   Implementations MAY choose to implement or optimize this keyword in
   another way that produces the same effect, such as by directly
   checking for the presence and size of a "prefixItems" array.
   Implementations that do not support annotation collection MUST do so.

10.3.1.3.  contains

   The value of this keyword MUST be a valid JSON Schema.

   An array instance is valid against "contains" if at least one of its
   elements is valid against the given schema.  The subschema MUST be
   applied to every array element even after the first match has been
   found, in order to collect annotations for use by other keywords.
   This is to ensure that all possible annotations are collected.

   Logically, the validation result of applying the value subschema to
   each item in the array MUST be ORed with "false", resulting in an
   overall validation result.

   This keyword produces an annotation value which is an array of the
   indexes to which this keyword validates successfully when applying
   its subschema, in ascending order.  The value MAY be a boolean "true"
   if the subschema validates successfully when applied to every index
   of the instance.  The annotation MUST be present if the instance
   array to which this keyword's schema applies is empty.

10.3.2.  Keywords for Applying Subschemas to Objects

10.3.2.1.  properties

   The value of "properties" MUST be an object.  Each value of this
   object MUST be a valid JSON Schema.

   Validation succeeds if, for each name that appears in both the
   instance and as a name within this keyword's value, the child
   instance for that name successfully validates against the
   corresponding schema.

   The annotation result of this keyword is the set of instance property
   names matched by this keyword.

   Omitting this keyword has the same assertion behavior as an empty
   object.

10.3.2.2.  patternProperties

   The value of "patternProperties" MUST be an object.  Each property
   name of this object SHOULD be a valid regular expression, according
   to the ECMA-262 regular expression dialect.  Each property value of
   this object MUST be a valid JSON Schema.

   Validation succeeds if, for each instance name that matches any
   regular expressions that appear as a property name in this keyword's
   value, the child instance for that name successfully validates
   against each schema that corresponds to a matching regular
   expression.

   The annotation result of this keyword is the set of instance property
   names matched by this keyword.

   Omitting this keyword has the same assertion behavior as an empty

10.3.2.3.  additionalProperties

   The value of "additionalProperties" MUST be a valid JSON Schema.

   The behavior of this keyword depends on the presence and annotation
   results of "properties" and "patternProperties" within the same
   schema object.  Validation with "additionalProperties" applies only
   to the child values of instance names that do not appear in the
   annotation results of either "properties" or "patternProperties".

   For all such properties, validation succeeds if the child instance
   validates against the "additionalProperties" schema.

   The annotation result of this keyword is the set of instance property
   names validated by this keyword's subschema.

   Omitting this keyword has the same assertion behavior as an empty
   schema.

   Implementations MAY choose to implement or optimize this keyword in
   another way that produces the same effect, such as by directly
   checking the names in "properties" and the patterns in
   "patternProperties" against the instance property set.
   Implementations that do not support annotation collection MUST do so.

10.3.2.4.  propertyNames

   The value of "propertyNames" MUST be a valid JSON Schema.

   If the instance is an object, this keyword validates if every
   property name in the instance validates against the provided schema.
   Note the property name that the schema is testing will always be a
   string.

   Omitting this keyword has the same behavior as an empty schema.

11.  A Vocabulary for Unevaluated Locations

   The purpose of these keywords is to enable schema authors to apply
   subschemas to array items or object properties that have not been
   successfully evaluated against any dynamic-scope subschema of any
   adjacent keywords.

   These instance items or properties may have been unsuccessfully
   evaluated against one or more adjacent keyword subschemas, such as
   when an assertion in a branch of an "anyOf" fails.  Such failed
   evaluations are not considered to contribute to whether or not the

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                 December 2020


   item or property has been evaluated.  Only successful evaluations are
   considered.

   If an item in an array or an object property is "successfully
   evaluated", it is logically considered to be valid in terms of the
   representation of the object or array that's expected.  For example
   if a subschema represents a car, which requires between 2-4 wheels,
   and the value of "wheels" is 6, the instance object is not
   "evaluated" to be a car, and the "wheels" property is considered
   "unevaluated (successfully as a known thing)", and does not retain
   any annotations.

   Recall that adjacent keywords are keywords within the same schema
   object, and that the dynamic-scope subschemas include reference
   targets as well as lexical subschemas.

   The behavior of these keywords depend on the annotation results of
   adjacent keywords that apply to the instance location being
   validated.

   Meta-schemas that do not use "$vocabulary" SHOULD be considered to
   require this vocabulary as if its URI were present with a value of
   true.

   The current URI for this vocabulary, known as the Unevaluated
   Applicator vocabulary, is: <https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-
   12/vocab/unevaluated>.

   The current URI for the corresponding meta-schema is: <https://json-
   schema.org/draft/2020-12/meta/unevaluated>.

   Updated vocabulary and meta-schema URIs MAY be published between
   specification drafts in order to correct errors.  Implementations
   SHOULD consider URIs dated after this specification draft and before
   the next to indicate the same syntax and semantics as those listed
   here.

11.1.  Keyword Independence

   Schema keywords typically operate independently, without affecting
   each other's outcomes.  However, the keywords in this vocabulary are
   notable exceptions:

      "unevaluatedItems", whose behavior is defined in terms of
      annotations from "prefixItems", "items", "contains", and itself

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                 December 2020


      "unevaluatedProperties", whose behavior is defined in terms of
      annotations from "properties", "patternProperties",
      "additionalProperties" and itself

11.2.  unevaluatedItems

   The value of "unevaluatedItems" MUST be a valid JSON Schema.

   The behavior of this keyword depends on the annotation results of
   adjacent keywords that apply to the instance location being
   validated.  Specifically, the annotations from "prefixItems",
   "items", and "contains", which can come from those keywords when they
   are adjacent to the "unevaluatedItems" keyword.  Those three
   annotations, as well as "unevaluatedItems", can also result from any
   and all adjacent in-place applicator (Section 10.2) keywords.  This
   includes but is not limited to the in-place applicators defined in
   this document.

   If no relevant annotations are present, the "unevaluatedItems"
   subschema MUST be applied to all locations in the array.  If a
   boolean true value is present from any of the relevant annotations,
   "unevaluatedItems" MUST be ignored.  Otherwise, the subschema MUST be
   applied to any index greater than the largest annotation value for
   "prefixItems", which does not appear in any annotation value for
   "contains".

   This means that "prefixItems", "items", "contains", and all in-place
   applicators MUST be evaluated before this keyword can be evaluated.
   Authors of extension keywords MUST NOT define an in-place applicator
   that would need to be evaluated after this keyword.

   If the "unevaluatedItems" subschema is applied to any positions
   within the instance array, it produces an annotation result of
   boolean true, analogous to the behavior of "items".

   Omitting this keyword has the same assertion behavior as an empty
   schema.

11.3.  unevaluatedProperties

   The value of "unevaluatedProperties" MUST be a valid JSON Schema.

   The behavior of this keyword depends on the annotation results of
   adjacent keywords that apply to the instance location being
   validated.  Specifically, the annotations from "properties",
   "patternProperties", and "additionalProperties", which can come from
   those keywords when they are adjacent to the "unevaluatedProperties"
   keyword.  Those three annotations, as well as

   "unevaluatedProperties", can also result from any and all adjacent
   in-place applicator (Section 10.2) keywords.  This includes but is
   not limited to the in-place applicators defined in this document.

   Validation with "unevaluatedProperties" applies only to the child
   values of instance names that do not appear in the "properties",
   "patternProperties", "additionalProperties", or
   "unevaluatedProperties" annotation results that apply to the instance
   location being validated.

   For all such properties, validation succeeds if the child instance
   validates against the "unevaluatedProperties" schema.

   This means that "properties", "patternProperties",
   "additionalProperties", and all in-place applicators MUST be
   evaluated before this keyword can be evaluated.  Authors of extension
   keywords MUST NOT define an in-place applicator that would need to be
   evaluated after this keyword.

   The annotation result of this keyword is the set of instance property
   names validated by this keyword's subschema.

   Omitting this keyword has the same assertion behavior as an empty
   schema.

12.  Output Formatting

   JSON Schema is defined to be platform-independent.  As such, to
   increase compatibility across platforms, implementations SHOULD
   conform to a standard validation output format.  This section
   describes the minimum requirements that consumers will need to
   properly interpret validation results.

12.1.  Format

   JSON Schema output is defined using the JSON Schema data instance
   model as described in section 4.2.1.  Implementations MAY deviate
   from this as supported by their specific languages and platforms,
   however it is RECOMMENDED that the output be convertible to the JSON
   format defined herein via serialization or other means.

12.2.  Output Formats

   This specification defines four output formats.  See the "Output
   Structure" section for the requirements of each format.

      Flag - A boolean which simply indicates the overall validation
      result with no further details.



Wright, et al.            Expires June 11, 2021                [Page 49]

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                 December 2020


      Basic - Provides validation information in a flat list structure.

      Detailed - Provides validation information in a condensed
      hierarchical structure based on the structure of the schema.

      Verbose - Provides validation information in an uncondensed
      hierarchical structure that matches the exact structure of the
      schema.

   An implementation SHOULD provide at least one of the "flag", "basic",
   or "detailed" format and MAY provide the "verbose" format.  If it
   provides one or more of the "detailed" or "verbose" formats, it MUST
   also provide the "flag" format.  Implementations SHOULD specify in
   their documentation which formats they support.

12.3.  Minimum Information

   Beyond the simplistic "flag" output, additional information is useful
   to aid in debugging a schema or instance.  Each sub-result SHOULD
   contain the information contained within this section at a minimum.

   A single object that contains all of these components is considered
   an output unit.

   Implementations MAY elect to provide additional information.

12.3.1.  Keyword Relative Location

   The relative location of the validating keyword that follows the
   validation path.  The value MUST be expressed as a JSON Pointer, and
   it MUST include any by-reference applicators such as "$ref" or
   "$dynamicRef".


   #/properties/width/$ref/minimum


   Note that this pointer may not be resolvable by the normal JSON
   Pointer process due to the inclusion of these by-reference applicator
   keywords.

   The JSON key for this information is "keywordLocation".

12.3.2.  Keyword Absolute Location

   The absolute, dereferenced location of the validating keyword.  The
   value MUST be expressed as a full URI using the canonical URI of the
   relevant schema object, and it MUST NOT include by-reference



Wright, et al.            Expires June 11, 2021                [Page 50]

   applicators such as "$ref" or "$dynamicRef" as non-terminal path
   components.  It MAY end in such keywords if the error or annotation
   is for that keyword, such as an unresolvable reference.  [[CREF12:
   Note that "absolute" here is in the sense of "absolute filesystem
   path" (meaning the complete location) rather than the "absolute-URI"
   terminology from RFC 3986 (meaning with scheme but without fragment).
   Keyword absolute locations will have a fragment in order to identify
   the keyword.  ]]


   https://example.com/schemas/common#/$defs/count/minimum


   This information MAY be omitted only if either the dynamic scope did
   not pass over a reference or if the schema does not declare an
   absolute URI as its "$id".

   The JSON key for this information is "absoluteKeywordLocation".

12.3.3.  Instance Location

   The location of the JSON value within the instance being validated.
   The value MUST be expressed as a JSON Pointer.

   The JSON key for this information is "instanceLocation".

12.3.4.  Error or Annotation

   The error or annotation that is produced by the validation.

   For errors, the specific wording for the message is not defined by
   this specification.  Implementations will need to provide this.

   For annotations, each keyword that produces an annotation specifies
   its format.  By default, it is the keyword's value.

   The JSON key for failed validations is "error"; for successful
   validations it is "annotation".

12.3.5.  Nested Results

   For the two hierarchical structures, this property will hold nested
   errors and annotations.

   The JSON key for nested results in failed validations is "errors";
   for successful validations it is "annotations".  Note the plural
   forms, as a keyword with nested results can also have a local error
   or annotation.

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                 December 2020


12.4.  Output Structure

   The output MUST be an object containing a boolean property named
   "valid".  When additional information about the result is required,
   the output MUST also contain "errors" or "annotations" as described
   below.

      "valid" - a boolean value indicating the overall validation
      success or failure

      "errors" - the collection of errors or annotations produced by a
      failed validation

      "annotations" - the collection of errors or annotations produced
      by a successful validation

   For these examples, the following schema and instance will be used.

     },
     {
       "x": 1,
       "z": 6.7
     }
   ]


   This instance will fail validation and produce errors, but it's
   trivial to deduce examples for passing schemas that produce
   annotations.

   Specifically, the errors it will produce are:

      The second object is missing a "y" property.

      The second object has a disallowed "z" property.

      There are only two objects, but three are required.

   Note that the error message wording as depicted in these examples is
   not a requirement of this specification.  Implementations SHOULD
   craft error messages tailored for their audience or provide a
   templating mechanism that allows their users to craft their own
   messages.

12.4.1.  Flag

   In the simplest case, merely the boolean result for the "valid" valid
   property needs to be fulfilled.


   {
     "valid": false
   }


   Because no errors or annotations are returned with this format, it is
   RECOMMENDED that implementations use short-circuiting logic to return
   failure or success as soon as the outcome can be determined.  For
   example, if an "anyOf" keyword contains five sub-schemas, and the
   second one passes, there is no need to check the other three.  The
   logic can simply return with success.

12.4.2.  Basic

   The "Basic" structure is a flat list of output units.

12.4.3.  Detailed

   The "Detailed" structure is based on the schema and can be more
   readable for both humans and machines.  Having the structure
   organized this way makes associations between the errors more
   apparent.  For example, the fact that the missing "y" property and
   the extra "z" property both stem from the same location in the
   instance is not immediately obvious in the "Basic" structure.  In a
   hierarchy, the correlation is more easily identified.

   The following rules govern the construction of the results object:

      All applicator keywords ("*Of", "$ref", "if"/"then"/"else", etc.)
      require a node.

      Nodes that have no children are removed.

      Nodes that have a single child are replaced by the child.

   Branch nodes do not require an error message or an annotation.

12.4.4.  Verbose

   The "Verbose" structure is a fully realized hierarchy that exactly
   matches that of the schema.  This structure has applications in form
   generation and validation where the error's location is important.

   The primary difference between this and the "Detailed" structure is
   that all results are returned.  This includes sub-schema validation

   results that would otherwise be removed (e.g. annotations for failed
   validations, successful validations inside a `not` keyword, etc.).
   Because of this, it is RECOMMENDED that each node also carry a

12.4.5.  Output validation schemas

   For convenience, JSON Schema has been provided to validate output
   generated by implementations.  Its URI is: <https://json-schema.org/
   draft/2020-12/output/schema>.

13.  Security Considerations

   Both schemas and instances are JSON values.  As such, all security
   considerations defined in RFC 8259 [RFC8259] apply.

   Instances and schemas are both frequently written by untrusted third
   parties, to be deployed on public Internet servers.  Validators
   should take care that the parsing and validating against schemas does
   not consume excessive system resources.  Validators MUST NOT fall
   into an infinite loop.

   A malicious party could cause an implementation to repeatedly collect
   a copy of a very large value as an annotation.  Implementations
   SHOULD guard against excessive consumption of system resources in
   such a scenario.

   Servers MUST ensure that malicious parties cannot change the
   functionality of existing schemas by uploading a schema with a pre-
   existing or very similar "$id".

   Individual JSON Schema vocabularies are liable to also have their own
   security considerations.  Consult the respective specifications for
   more information.

   Schema authors should take care with "$comment" contents, as a
   malicious implementation can display them to end-users in violation
   of a spec, or fail to strip them if such behavior is expected.

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                 December 2020


   A malicious schema author could place executable code or other
   dangerous material within a "$comment".  Implementations MUST NOT
   parse or otherwise take action based on "$comment" contents.

14.  IANA Considerations

14.1.  application/schema+json

   The proposed MIME media type for JSON Schema is defined as follows:

      Type name: application

      Subtype name: schema+json

      Required parameters: N/A

      Optional parameters:

      schema:  A non-empty list of space-separated URIs, each
         identifying a JSON Schema resource.  The instance SHOULD
         successfully validate against at least one of these meta-
         schemas.  Non-validating meta-schemas MAY be included for
         purposes such as allowing clients to make use of older versions
         of a meta-schema as long as the runtime instance validates
         against that older version.

      Encoding considerations: Encoding considerations are identical to
      those specified for the "application/json" media type.  See JSON
      [RFC8259].

      Security considerations: See Section 13 above.

      Interoperability considerations: See Sections 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4

   identify both the root schema and various subschemas, and "$anchor"
   being used to define plain name fragment identifiers.

       "$defs": {
           "A": { "$anchor": "foo" },
           "B": {
               "$id": "other.json",
               "$defs": {
                   "X": { "$anchor": "bar" },

Appendix B.  Manipulating schema documents and references

   Various tools have been created to rearrange schema documents based
   on how and where references ("$ref") appear.  This appendix discusses
   which use cases and actions are compliant with this specification.

B.1.  Bundling schema resources into a single document

   A set of schema resources intended for use together can be organized
   with each in its own schema document, all in the same schema
   document, or any granularity of document grouping in between.

   Numerous tools exist to perform various sorts of reference removal.
   A common case of this is producing a single file where all references
   can be resolved within that file.  This is typically done to simplify
   distribution, or to simplify coding so that various invocations of
   JSON Schema libraries do not have to keep track of and load a large
   number of resources.

   This transformation can be safely and reversibly done as long as all
   static references (e.g. "$ref") use URI-references that resolve to
   canonical URIs, and all schema resources have an absolute-URI as the
   "$id" in their root schema.

   With these conditions met, each external resource can be copied under
   "$defs", without breaking any references among the resources' schema
   objects, and without changing any aspect of validation or annotation
   results.  The names of the schemas under "$defs" do not affect
   behavior, assuming they are each unique, as they do not appear in
   canonical URIs for the embedded resources.

B.2.  Reference removal is not always safe

   Attempting to remove all references and produce a single schema
   document does not, in all cases, produce a schema with identical
   behavior to the original form.

   Since "$ref" is now treated like any other keyword, with other
   keywords allowed in the same schema objects, fully supporting non-
   recursive "$ref" removal in all cases can require relatively complex
   schema manipulations.  It is beyond the scope of this specification
   to determine or provide a set of safe "$ref" removal transformations,
   as they depend not only on the schema structure but also on the
   intended usage.

Appendix C.  Example of recursive schema extension

   Consider the following two schemas describing a simple recursive tree
   structure, where each node in the tree can have a "data" field of any
   type.  The first schema allows and ignores other instance properties.
   The second is more strict and only allows the "data" and "children"
   properties.  An example instance with "data" misspelled as "daat" is
   also shown.


   // tree schema, extensible
   {
       "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
       "$id": "https://example.com/tree",
       "$dynamicAnchor": "node",

       "type": "object",
       "properties": {
           "data": true,
           "children": {
               "type": "array",
               "items": {
                   "$dynamicRef": "#node"
               }
           }
       }
   }

   // strict-tree schema, guards against misspelled properties
   {
       "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
       "$id": "https://example.com/strict-tree",
       "$dynamicAnchor": "node",

       "$ref": "tree",
       "unevaluatedProperties": false
   }

   // instance with misspelled field
   {
       "children": [ { "daat": 1 } ]
   }


   When we load these two schemas, we will notice the "$dynamicAnchor"
   named "node" (note the lack of "#" as this is just the name) present
   in each, resulting in the following full schema URIs:




Wright, et al.            Expires June 11, 2021                [Page 67]

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                 December 2020


   o  "https://example.com/tree#node"

   o  "https://example.com/strict-tree#node"

   In addition, JSON Schema implementations keep track of the fact that
   these fragments were created with "$dynamicAnchor".

   If we apply the "strict-tree" schema to the instance, we will follow
   the "$ref" to the "tree" schema, examine its "children" subschema,
   and find the "$dynamicRef": to "#node" (note the "#" for URI fragment
   syntax) in its "items" subschema.  That reference resolves to
   "https://example.com/tree#node", which is a URI with a fragment
   created by "$dynamicAnchor".  Therefore we must examine the dynamic
   scope before following the reference.

   At this point, the dynamic path is "#/$ref/properties/children/
   items/$dynamicRef", with a dynamic scope containing (from the
   outermost scope to the innermost):

   1.  "https://example.com/strict-tree#"

   2.  "https://example.com/tree#"

   3.  "https://example.com/tree#/properties/children"

   4.  "https://example.com/tree#/properties/children/items"

   Since we are looking for a plain name fragment, which can be defined
   anywhere within a schema resource, the JSON Pointer fragments are
   irrelevant to this check.  That means that we can remove those
   fragments and eliminate consecutive duplicates, producing:

   1.  "https://example.com/strict-tree"

   2.  "https://example.com/tree"

   In this case, the outermost resource also has a "node" fragment
   defined by "$dynamicAnchor".  Therefore instead of resolving the
   "$dynamicRef" to "https://example.com/tree#node", we resolve it to
   "https://example.com/strict-tree#node".

   This way, the recursion in the "tree" schema recurses to the root of
   "strict-tree", instead of only applying "strict-tree" to the instance
   root, but applying "tree" to instance children.

   This example shows both "$dynamicAnchor"s in the same place in each
   schema, specifically the resource root schema.  Since plain-name
   fragments are independent of the JSON structure, this would work just

   as well if one or both of the node schema objects were moved under
   "$defs".  It is the matching "$dynamicAnchor" values which tell us
   how to resolve the dynamic reference, not any sort of correlation in
   JSON structure.

Appendix D.  Working with vocabularies

D.1.  Best practices for vocabulary and meta-schema authors

   Vocabulary authors should take care to avoid keyword name collisions
   if the vocabulary is intended for broad use, and potentially combined
   with other vocabularies.  JSON Schema does not provide any formal
   namespacing system, but also does not constrain keyword names,
   allowing for any number of namespacing approaches.

   Vocabularies may build on each other, such as by defining the
   behavior of their keywords with respect to the behavior of keywords
   from another vocabulary, or by using a keyword from another
   vocabulary with a restricted or expanded set of acceptable values.
   Not all such vocabulary re-use will result in a new vocabulary that
   is compatible with the vocabulary on which it is built.  Vocabulary
   authors should clearly document what level of compatibility, if any,
   is expected.

   Meta-schema authors should not use "$vocabulary" to combine multiple
   vocabularies that define conflicting syntax or semantics for the same
   keyword.  As semantic conflicts are not generally detectable through
   schema validation, implementations are not expected to detect such
   conflicts.  If conflicting vocabularies are declared, the resulting
   behavior is undefined.

   Vocabulary authors SHOULD provide a meta-schema that validates the
   expected usage of the vocabulary's keywords on their own.  Such meta-
   schemas SHOULD not forbid additional keywords, and MUST not forbid
   any keywords from the Core vocabulary.

   It is recommended that meta-schema authors reference each
   vocabulary's meta-schema using the "allOf" (Section 10.2.1.1)
   keyword, although other mechanisms for constructing the meta-schema
   may be appropriate for certain use cases.

   The recursive nature of meta-schemas makes the "$dynamicAnchor" and
   "$dynamicRef" keywords particularly useful for extending existing
   meta-schemas, as can be seen in the JSON Hyper-Schema meta-schema
   which extends the Validation meta-schema.

   Meta-schemas may impose additional constraints, including describing
   keywords not present in any vocabulary, beyond what the meta-schemas

Internet-Draft                 JSON Schema                 December 2020


   associated with the declared vocabularies describe.  This allows for
   restricting usage to a subset of a vocabulary, and for validating
   locally defined keywords not intended for re-use.

   However, meta-schemas should not contradict any vocabularies that
   they declare, such as by requiring a different JSON type than the
   vocabulary expects.  The resulting behavior is undefined.

   Meta-schemas intended for local use, with no need to test for
   vocabulary support in arbitrary implementations, can safely omit
   "$vocabulary" entirely.

D.2.  Example meta-schema with vocabulary declarations

   This meta-schema explicitly declares both the Core and Applicator
   vocabularies, together with an extension vocabulary, and combines
   their meta-schemas with an "allOf".  The extension vocabulary's meta-
   schema, which describes only the keywords in that vocabulary, is
   shown after the main example meta-schema.

   The main example meta-schema also restricts the usage of the
   Unevaluated vocabulary by forbidding the keywords prefixed with
   "unevaluated", which are particularly complex to implement.  This
   does not change the semantics or set of keywords defined by the other
   vocabularies.  It just ensures that schemas using this meta-schema
   that attempt to use the keywords prefixed with "unevaluated" will
   fail validation against this meta-schema.

   Finally, this meta-schema describes the syntax of a keyword,
   "localKeyword", that is not part of any vocabulary.  Presumably, the
   implementors and users of this meta-schema will understand the
   semantics of "localKeyword".  JSON Schema does not define any
   mechanism for expressing keyword semantics outside of vocabularies,
   making them unsuitable for use except in a specific environment in
   which they are understood.

       "https://example.com/vocab/example-vocab": true,
     },
     "type": ["object", "boolean"],
     "properties": {
       "minDate": {
         "type": "string",
         "pattern": "\d\d\d\d-\d\d-\d\d",
         "format": "date",
       }
     }
   }


   As shown above, even though each of the single-vocabulary meta-
   schemas referenced in the general-use meta-schema's "allOf" declares
   its corresponding vocabulary, this new meta-schema must re-declare
   them.

   The standard meta-schemas that combine all vocabularies defined by
   the Core and Validation specification, and that combine all
   vocabularies defined by those specifications as well as the Hyper-
   Schema specification, demonstrate additional complex combinations.
   These URIs for these meta-schemas may be found in the Validation and
   Hyper-Schema specifications, respectively.

   While the general-use meta-schema can validate the syntax of
   "minDate", it is the vocabulary that defines the logic behind the
   semantic meaning of "minDate".  Without an understanding of the
   semantics (in this example, that the instance value must be a date
   equal to or after the date provided as the keyword's value in the
   schema), an implementation can only validate the syntactic usage.  In
   this case, that means validating that it is a date-formatted string
   (using "pattern" to ensure that it is validated even when "format"
   functions purely as an annotation, as explained in the Validation
   specification [json-schema-validation].

Appendix E.  References and generative use cases

   While the presence of references is expected to be transparent to
   validation results, generative use cases such as code generators and
   UI renderers often consider references to be semantically
   significant.

   To make such use case-specific semantics explicit, the best practice
   is to create an annotation keyword for use in the same schema object
   alongside of a reference keyword such as "$ref".

   For example, here is a hypothetical keyword for determining whether a
   code generator should consider the reference target to be a distinct
   class, and how those classes are related.  Note that this example is
   solely for illustrative purposes, and is not intended to propose a
   functional code generation keyword.


   {
       "allOf": [
           {
               "classRelation": "is-a",
               "$ref": "classes/base.json"
           },
           {
               "$ref": "fields/common.json"
           }
       ],
       "properties": {
           "foo": {
               "classRelation": "has-a",
               "$ref": "classes/foo.json"
           },
           "date": {
               "$ref": "types/dateStruct.json",
           }
       }
   }


   Here, this schema represents some sort of object-oriented class.  The
   first reference in the "allOf" is noted as the base class.  The
   second is not assigned a class relationship, meaning that the code
   generator should combine the target's definition with this one as if
   no reference were involved.

   Looking at the properties, "foo" is flagged as object composition,
   while the "date" property is not.  It is simply a field with sub-
   fields, rather than an instance of a distinct class.

   This style of usage requires the annotation to be in the same object
   as the reference, which must be recognizable as a reference.
