            The Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol
                     draft-hardt-xauth-protocol-10

Abstract

   Client software often desires resources or identity claims that are
   independent of the client.  This protocol allows a user and/or
   resource owner to delegate resource authorization and/or release of
   identity claims to a server.  Client software can then request access
   to resources and/or identity claims by calling the server.  The
   server acquires consent and authorization from the user and/or
   resource owner if required, and then returns to the client software
   the authorization and identity claims that were approved.  This
   protocol may be extended to support alternative authorizations,
   claims, interactions, and client authentication mechanisms.

1.  Introduction

   *EDITOR NOTE*

   _This document captures a number of concepts that may be adopted by
   the proposed GNAP working group.  Please refer to this document as:_

   *XAuth*

   _The use of GNAP in this document is not intended to be a declaration
   of it being endorsed by the proposed GNAP working group._

   This document describes the core Grant Negotiation and Authorization
   Protocol (GNAP).  The protocol supports the widely deployed use cases
   supported by OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] & [RFC6750], OpenID Connect [OIDC] -
   an extension of OAuth 2.0, as well as other extensions.  Related
   documents include: GNAP - Advanced Features [GNAP_Advanced] and JOSE
   Authentication [JOSE_Authentication] that describes the JOSE
   mechanisms for client authentication.

   The technology landscape has changed since OAuth 2.0 was initially
   drafted.  More interactions happen on mobile devices than PCs.
   Modern browsers now directly support asymetric cryptographic
   functions.  Standards have emerged for signing and encrypting tokens
   with rich payloads (JOSE) that are widely deployed.

   GNAP simplifies the overall architectural model, takes advantage of
   today's technology landscape, provides support for all the widely
   deployed use cases, offers numerous extension points, and addresses
   many of the security issues in OAuth 2.0 by passing parameters
   securely between parties, rather than via a browser redirection. .

   While GNAP is not backwards compatible with OAuth 2.0, it strives to
   minimize the migration effort.

   GNAP centers around a Grant, a representation of the collection of
   user identity claims and/or resource authorizations the Client is
   requesting, and the resulting identity claims and/or resource
   authorizations granted by the Grant Server (GS).

   User consent is often required at the GS.  GNAP enables a Client and
   GS to negotiate the interaction mode for the GS to obtain consent.

   The suggested pronunciation of GNAP is the same as the English word
   "nap", a silent "g" as in "gnaw".

   This document specifies interactions between the Client and GS (1),
   and the Client and RS (2).

   *  *User* - the person interacting with the Client who has delegated
      access to identity claims about themselves to the Grant Server
      (GS), and can authenticate at the GS.

   *  *Client* - requests a Grant from the GS to access one or more
      Resource Servers (RSs), and/or identity claims about the User.
      The Grant may include access tokens that the Client uses to access
      the RS.  There are two types of Clients: Registered Clients and
      Dynamic Clients.  All Clients have a private asymetric key to
      authenticate with the Grant Server.

   *  *Registered Client* - a Client that has registered with the GS and
      has a Client ID to identify itself, and can prove it possesses a
      key that is linked to the Client ID.  The GS may have different
      policies for what different Registered Clients can request.  A
      Registered Client MAY be interacting with a User.

   *  *Dynamic Client* - a Client that has not been previously
      registered with the GS, and each instance will generate it's own
      asymetric key pair so it can prove it is the same instance of the
      Client on subsequent requests.  The GS MAY return a Dynamic Client
      a Client Handle for the Client to identify itself in subsequent
      requests.  A single-page application with no active server
      component is an example of a Dynamic Client.  A Dynamic Client
      MUST be interacting with a User.

Internet-DraThe Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol   June 2020


   *  *Grant Server* (GS) - manages Grants for access to APIs at RSs and
      release of identity claims about the User.  The GS may require
      explicit consent from the RO or User to provide these to the
      Client.  A GS may support Registered Clients and/or Dynamic
      Clients.  The GS is a combination of the Authorization Server (AS)
      in OAuth 2.0, and the OpenID Provider (OP) in OpenID Connect.

   *  *Resource Server* (RS) - has API resources that require an access
      token from the GS.  Some, or all of the resources are owned by the
      Resource Owner.

   *  *Resource Owner* (RO) - owns resources at the RS, and has
      delegated RS access management to the GS.  The RO may be the same
      entity as the User, or may be a different entity that the GS
      interacts with independently.  GS and RO interactions are out of
      scope of this document.

1.2.  Reused Terms

   *  *access token* - an access token as defined in [RFC6749]
      Section 1.4.

   *  *Claim* - a Claim as defined in [OIDC] Section 5.  Claims may be
      issued by the GS, or by other issuers.

   *  *Client ID* - a GS unique identifier for a Registered Client as
      defined in [RFC6749] Section 2.2.

   *  *ID Token* - an ID Token as defined in [OIDC] Section 2.

   *  *NumericDate* - a NumericDate as defined in [RFC7519] Section 2.

   *  *authN* - short for authentication.

   *  *authZ* - short for authorization.

1.3.  New Terms

   *  *GS URI* - the endpoint at the GS the Client calls to create a
      Grant, and is the unique identifier for the GS.

   *  *Grant* - the user identity claims and/or RS authorizations the GS
      has granted to the Client.  The GS MAY invalidate a Grant at any
      time.

   *  *Grant URI* - the URI that represents the Grant.  The Grant URI
      MUST start with the GS URI.

Internet-DraThe Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol   June 2020


   *  *Authorization* - the access granted by the RO to the Client and
      contains an access token.  The GS may invalidate an Authorization
      at any time.

   *  *Authorization URI* (AZ URI) - the URI that represents the
      Authorization the Client was granted by the RO.  The AZ URI MUST
      start with the GS URI.  The AZ URI is used to refresh an access
      token.

   *  *Interaction* - how the Client directs the User to interact with
      the GS.  This document defines the interaction modes: "redirect",
      "indirect", and "user_code" in Section 5

   *  *Client Handle* - a unique identifier at the GS for a Dynamic
      Client for the Dynamic Client to refer to itself in subsequent
      requests.

1.4.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   specification are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Certain security-related terms are to be understood in the sense
   defined in [RFC4949].  These terms include, but are not limited to,
   "attack", "authentication", "authorization", "certificate",
   "confidentiality", "credential", "encryption", "identity", "sign",
   "signature", "trust", "validate", and "verify".

   _[Editor: review terms]_

   Unless otherwise noted, all the protocol parameter names and values
   are case sensitive.

   Some protocol parameters are parts of a JSON document, and are
   referred to in JavaScript notation.  For example, foo.bar refers to
   the "bar" boolean attribute in the "foo" object in the following
   example JSON document:

   {
       "foo" : {
           "bar": true
       }
   }

2.  Sequences

   Before any sequence, the Client needs to be manually or
   programmatically configured for the GS.  See GS Options Section 3.6
   for details on programmatically acquiring GS metadata.

2.1.  "redirect" Interaction

   The Client is a web application and wants a Grant from the User:

   +--------+                                  +-------+

   1.  *Create Grant* The Client creates a Request JSON document
       Section 3.4 containing an interaction.redirect object and makes a
       Create Grant request (Section 3.2) by sending the JSON with an
       HTTP POST to the GS URI.

   2.  *Interaction Response* The GS determines that interaction with
       the User is required and sends an Interaction Response
       (Section 4.2) containing the Grant URI and an
       interaction.redirect object.

   3.  *Interaction Transfer* The Client redirects the User to the
       authorization_uri at the GS.

   4.  *User Authentication* The GS authenticates the User.

   5.  *User Authorization* If required, the GS interacts with the User
       to determine which identity claims and/or authorizations in the

   1.  *Create Grant* The Client creates a Request JSON document
       Section 3.4 containing an interaction.user_code object and makes
       a Create Grant request (Section 3.2) by sending the JSON with an
       HTTP POST to the GS URI.

   2.  *Interaction Response* The GS determines that interaction with
       the User is required and sends an Interaction Response
       (Section 4.2) containing the Grant URI and an
       interaction.user_code object.

   3.  *Read Grant* The Client makes an HTTP GET request to the Grant
       URI.

   4.  *User Authentication* The User loads display_uri in their
       browser, and the GS authenticates the User.

   5.  *User Code* The User enters the code at the GS.

   6.  *User Authorization* If required, the GS interacts with the User
       to determine which identity claims and/or authorizations in the

       (Section 4.1).

   8.  *Completion URI Redirect* The GS redirects the User to the
       completion_uri provided by the Client.

2.3.  Independent RO Authorization

   The Client wants access to resources that require the GS to interact
   with the RO, who is not interacting with the Client.  The
   authorization from the RO may take some time, so the GS instructs the
   Client to wait and check back later.

   4.  *RO AuthZ* The GS interacts with the RO to determine which
       identity claims and/or resource authorizations in the Grant
       Request are to be granted.

   5.  *Read Grant* The Client does an HTTP GET of the Grant URI
       (Section 3.3).

   6.  *Grant Response* The GS responds with a Grant Response
       (Section 4.1).

2.4.  Resource Server Access

   The Client received an AZ URI from the GS.  The Client acquires an
   access token, calls the RS, and later the access token expires.  The
   Client then gets a fresh access token.

   +--------+                             +----------+  +-------+

       token per Section 6 and receives a response from the RS.

   2.  *Resource Request* The Client attempts to access the RS, but
       receives an error indicating the access token needs to be
       refreshed.

   3.  *Read AuthZ* The Client makes a Read AuthZ (Section 3.5) with an
       HTTP GET to the AZ URI and receives an Response JSON
       "authorization" object (Section 4.4.4) with a fresh access token.

3.  GS APIs

   *Client Authentication*

   All GS APIs except for GS Options require the Client to authenticate.
   Authentication mechanisms include:

3.6.  GS Options

   The Client can get the metadata for the GS by doing an HTTP OPTIONS
   of the corresponding GS URI.  This is the only API where the GS MAY
   respond to an unauthenticated request.

   The GS MUST respond with the the following JSON document:

   *  *uri* - the GS URI.

   *  *client_authentication* - a JSON array of the Client
      Authentication mechanisms supported by the GS

   *  *interactions* - a JSON array of the interaction modes supported
      by the GS.

   *  *authorization* - an object containing the authorizations the
      Client may request from the GS, if any.

      -  Details TBD

4.6.  Response Verification

   On receipt of a response, the Client MUST verify the following:

   *  TBD

5.  Interaction Modes

   This document defines three interaction modes: "redirect",
   "indirect", and "user_code".  Extensions may define additional
   interaction modes.

   The "global" attribute is reserved in the interaction object for
   attributes that apply to all interaction modes.

5.1.  "redirect"

   A Redirect Interaction is characterized by the Client redirecting the
   User's browser to the GS, the GS interacting with the User, and then
   GS redirecting the User's browser back to the Client.  The GS
   correlates the Grant Request with the unique authorization_uri, and
   the Client correlates the Grant Request with the unique redirect_uri.

   *The request "interaction" object contains:*

   *  *redirect_uri* a unique URI at the Client that the GS will return
      the User to.  The URI MUST not contain the "nonce" from the Grant
      Request, and MUST not be guessable.  This attribute is REQUIRED.

   *The response "interaction" object contains:*

   *  *authorization_uri* a unique URI at the GS that the Client will
      redirect the User to.  The URI MUST not contain the "nonce" from
      the Grant Request, and MUST not be guessable.  This attribute is
      REQUIRED.

Internet-DraThe Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol   June 2020


5.2.  "indirect"

   An Indirect Interaction is characterized by the Client causing the
   User's browser to load the short_uri at GS, the GS interacting with
   the User, and then the GS MAY optionally redirect the User's Browser
   to a completion_uri.  There is no mechanism for the GS to redirect
   the User's browser back to the Client.

   Examples of how the Client may initiate the interaction are encoding
   the short_uri as a code scannable by the User's mobile device, or
   launching a system browser from a command line interface (CLI)
   application.

   The "indirect" mode is susceptible to session fixation attacks.  See
   TBD in the Security Considerations for details.

   *The request "interaction" object contains:*

   *  *completion_uri* an OPTIONAL URI that the GS will redirect the
      User's browser to after GS interaction.

   *The response "interaction" object contains:*

   *  *short_uri* the URI the Client will cause to load in the User's
      browser.  The URI SHOULD be short enough to be easily encoded in a
      scannable code.  The URI MUST not contain the "nonce" from the
      Grant Request, and MUST not be guessable. _[Editor: recommend a
      maximum length?]_

5.3.  "user_code"

   An Indirect Interaction is characterized by the Client displaying a
   code and a URI for the User to load in a browser and then enter the
   code.  _[Editor: recommend a minimum entropy?]_

   *The request "interaction" object contains:*

   *  *completion_uri* an OPTIONAL URI that the GS will redirect the
      User's browser to after GS interaction.

   *The response "interaction" object contains:*

   *  *code* the code the Client displays to the User to enter at the
      display_uri.  This attribute is REQUIRED.

   *  *display_uri* the URI the Client displays to the User to load in a
      browser to enter the code.

6.  RS Access

   The mechanism the Client MUST use to access an RS is in the
   Authorization JSON "mechanism" attribute Section 4.4.4.

   The "bearer" mechanism is defined in Section 2.1 of [RFC6750]

   The "jose" and "jose+body" mechanisms are defined in
   [JOSE_Authentication]

   A non-normative "bearer" example of the HTTP request headers follows:

   GET /calendar HTTP/2
   Host: calendar.example
   Authorization: bearer eyJJ2D6.example.access.token.mZf9pTSpA

7.  Error Responses

   *  TBD

8.  Warnings

   Warnings assist a Client in detecting non-fatal errors.

   *  TBD

9.  Extensibility

   This standard can be extended in a number of areas:

   *  *Client Authentication Mechanisms*

      -  An extension could define other mechanisms for the Client to
         authenticate to the GS and/or RS such as Mutual TLS or HTTP
         Signing.  Constrained environments could use CBOR [RFC7049]
         instead of JSON, and COSE [RFC8152] instead of JOSE, and CoAP
         [RFC8323] instead of HTTP/2.

   *  *Grant*

      -  An extension can define new objects in the Grant Request and
         Grant Response JSON that return new URIs.

   *  *Top Level*

      -  Top level objects SHOULD only be defined to represent
         functionality other the existing top level objects and
         attributes.

Internet-DraThe Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol   June 2020


   *  *"client" Object*

      -  Additional information about the Client that the GS would
         require related to an extension.

   *  *"user" Object*

      -  Additional information about the User that the GS would require
         related to an extension.

   *  *"authorization" Object*

      -  Additional authorization schemas in addition to OAuth 2.0
         scopes and RAR.

   *  *"claims" Object*

      -  Additional claim schemas in addition to OpenID Connect claims
         and Verified Credentials.

   *  *interaction modes*

      -  Additional types of interactions a Client can start with the
         User.

   *  *Continuous Authentication*

      -  An extension could define a mechanism for the Client to
         regularly provide continuous authentication signals and receive
         responses.

   _[Editor: do we specify access token introspection in this document,
   or leave that to an extension?]_

10.  Rational

   1.  *Why have both Client ID and Client Handle?*

       While they both refer to a Client in the protocol, the Client ID
       refers to a pre-registered client,and the Client Handle is
       specific to an instance of a Dynamic Client.  Using separate
       terms clearly differentiates which identifier is being presented
       to the GS.

   2.  *Why allow Client and GS to negotiate the user interaction mode?*






Hardt                   Expires 10 December 2020               [Page 28]

Internet-DraThe Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol   June 2020


       The Client knows what interaction modes it is capable of, and the
       GS knows which interaction modes it will permit for a given Grant
       Request.  The Client can then present the intersection to the
       User to choose which one is preferred.  For example, while a
       device based Client may be willing to do both "indirect" and
       "user_code", a GS may not enable "indirect" for concern of a
       session fixation attack.  Additional interaction modes will
       likely become available which allows new modes to be negotiated
       between Client and GS as each adds additional interaction modes.

   3.  *Why have both claims and authorizations?*

       There are use cases for each that are independent: authenticating
       a user and providing claims vs granting access to a resource.  A
       request for an authorization returns an access token which may
       have full CRUD capabilities, while a request for a claim returns
       the claim about the User - with no create, update or delete
       capabilities.  While the UserInfo endpoint in OIDC may be thought
       of as a resource, separating the concepts and how they are
       requested keeps each of them simpler in the Editor's opinion. :)

   4.  *Why do some of the JSON objects only have one child, such as the
       identifiers object in the user object in the Grant Request?*

       It is difficult to forecast future use cases.  Having more
       resolution may mean the difference between a simple extension,
       and a convoluted extension.  For example, the "global" object in
       the "interaction" object allows new global parameters to be added
       without impacting new interaction modes.

   5.  *Why is the "iss" included in the "oidc" identifier object?
       Would the "sub" not be enough for the GS to identify the User?*

       This decouples the GS from the OpenID Provider (OP).  The GS
       identifier is the GS URI, which is the endpoint at the GS.  The
       OP issuer identifier will likely not be the same as the GS URI.
       The GS may also provide claims from multiple OPs.

   6.  *Why is there not a UserInfo endpoint as there is with OpenID
       Connect?*

       Since the Client can Read Grant at any time, it get the same
       functionality as the UserInfo endpoint, without the Client having
       to manage a separate access token and refresh token.  If the
       Client would like additional claims, it can Update Grant, and the
       GS will let the Client know if an interaction is required to get
       any of the additional claims, which the Client can then start.

Internet-DraThe Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol   June 2020


       _[Editor: is there some other reason to have the UserInfo
       endpoint?]_

   7.  *Why use URIs for the Grant and Authorization?*

       *  Grant URI and AZ URI are defined to start with the GS URI,
          allowing the Client, and GS to determine which GS a Grant or
          Authorization belongs to.

       *  URIs also enable a RESTful interface to the GS functionality.

       *  A large scale GS can easily separate out the services that
          provide functionality as routing of requests can be done at
          the HTTP layer based on URI and HTTP verb.  This allows a
          separation of concerns, independent deployment, and
          resiliency.

   8.  *Why use the OPTIONS verb on the GS URI?  Why not use a .well-
       known mechanism?*

       Having the GS URI endpoint respond to the metadata allows the GS
       to provide Client specific results using the same Client
       authentication used for other requests to the GS.  It also
       reduces the risk of a mismatch between the advertised metadata,
       and the actual metadata.  A .well-known discovery mechanism may
       be defined to resolve from a hostname to the GS URI.

      XAuth

A.11.  draft-hardt-xauth-protocol-10

   *  added example of RAR authorization request

   *  fixed typos

Appendix B.  Comparison with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect

   *Changed Features*

   The major changes between GNAP and OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect are:

   *  The Client always uses a private asymetric key to authenticate to
      the GS.  There is no client secret. i

   *  The Client initiates the protocol by making a signed request
      directly to the GS instead of redirecting the User to the GS.

   *  The Client does not pass any parameters in redirecting the User to
      the GS.

   *  The refresh_token has been replaced with a AZ URI that both
      represents the authorization, and is the URI for obtaining a fresh
      access token.

   *  The Client can request identity claims to be returned independent
      of the ID Token.  There is no UserInfo endpoint to query claims as
      there is in OpenID Connect.

   *  The GS URI is the token endpoint.

   *Preserved Features*

   *  GNAP reuses the scopes, Client IDs, and access tokens of OAuth
      2.0.

   *  GNAP reuses the Client IDs, Claims and ID Token of OpenID Connect.

   *  No change is required by the Client or the RS for accessing
      existing bearer token protected APIs.

Internet-DraThe Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol   June 2020


   *New Features*

   *  All Client calls to the GS are authenticated with asymetric
      cryptography

   *  A Grant represents both the user identity claims and RS access
      granted to the Client.

   *  Support for scannable code initiated interactions.

   *  Highly extensible per Section 9.
