Abstract

   This memo is an extension to the SNMP MIB.  The origin of this memo
   is from RFC 1269 "Definitions of Managed Objects for the Border
   Gateway Protocol (Version 3)", which was updated to support BGP-4 in
   RFC 1657.  This memo fixes errors introduced when the MIB was
   converted to use the SNMPv2 SMI, as well as updates references to the
   current SNMP framework documents.

   This memo is intended to document deployed implementations of this
   MIB in a historical context, provide clarifications of some items and
   also note errors where the MIB fails to fully represent the BGP
   protocol.  Work is currently in progress to replace this MIB with a
   new one representing the current state of the BGP protocol and its
   extensions.

   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.  Please forward comments to
   idr@merit.net.


1. Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the
   Border Gateway Protocol Version 4 or lower [BGP, BGPAPPL].

2. The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

     -- An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

     -- Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC
        1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described
        in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and
        STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

     -- Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of
        the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the

        message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906
        [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

     -- Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of
        protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
        RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

     -- A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
        in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

3. Overview

   These objects are used to control and manage a BGP-4 implementation.

   Apart from a few system-wide scalar objects, this MIB is broken into
   three tables: the BGP Peer Table, the BGP Received Path Attribute
   Table, and the BGP-4 Received Path Attribute Table.  The BGP Peer
   Table contains information about state and current activity of
   connections with the BGP peers.  The Received Path Attribute Table
   contains path attributes received from all peers running BGP version
   3 or less.  The BGP-4 Received Path Attribute Table contains path
   attributes received from all BGP-4 peers.  The actual attributes used
   in determining a route are a subset of the received attribute tables
   after local routing policy has been applied.

8. Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write:

      bgpPeerAdminStatus
      bgpPeerConnectRetryInterval
      bgpPeerHoldTimeConfigured
      bgpPeerKeepAliveConfigured
      bgpPeerMinASOriginationInterval
      bgpPeerMinRouteAdvertisementInterval

   These objects should be considered sensitive or vulnerable in most
   network environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  Incorrect configuration of these parameters may
   cause BGP peer connections to terminate early or to send more routes
   under a flapping condition.

   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may be
   considered to contain sensitive information in the operation of a
   network.  For example, a BGP peer's local and remote addresses may be
   sensitive for ISPs who want to keep interface addresses on routers
   confidential to prevent router addresses used for a denial of service
   attack or spoofing.

   Therefore, it may be important in some environments to control read
   access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of
   these object when sending them over the network via SNMP.  Not all
   versions of SNMP provide features for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2274 [14] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2275 [17] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
