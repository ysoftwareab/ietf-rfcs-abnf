              draft-housley-hash-of-root-key-cert-extn-00

Abstract

   This document specifies a certificate extension that is carried in
   the self-signed certificate for a trust anchor, which is often called
   a Root Certification Authority (CA) certificate, to identify the next
   public key that will be used by the trust anchor.

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the Hash Of Root Key X.509 version 3
   certificate extension.  The extension is an optional addition to the
   Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate
   Revocation List (CRL) Profile [RFC5280].  The certificate extension
   facilitates the orderly transition from one Root Certification
   Authority (CA) public key to the next.  It does so by publishing the
   hash value of the next generation public key in the current self-
   signed certificate.  This allows a relying party to unambiguously
   recognize the next generation public key when it becomes available.

   A Root CA Certificate MAY include the Hashed Root Key certificate
   extension to provide the hash value of the next public key that will
   be used by the Root CA.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  ASN.1

   Certificates [RFC5280] are generated using ASN.1 [X680], which uses
   the Basic Encoding Rules (BER) and the Distinguished Encoding Rules
   (DER) [X690].

Internet-Draft         Hash Of Root Key Extension             March 2018


2.  Overview

   Before the initial deployment of the Root CA, the following are
   generated:

      R1 = The initial Root key pair
      C1 = Self-signed certificate for R1, which also contains H2
      R2 = The second generation Root key pair
      H2 = Thumbprint (hash) of the public key of R2

   C1 is a self-signed certificate, and it contains H2 within the
   hashOfRootKey extension.  C1 is distributed as part of the initial
   the system deployment.  The hashOfRootKey certificate extension is
   described in Section 3.

   When the time comes to replace the initial Root CA certificate, R1,
   the following are generated:

      R3 = The third generation Root key pair
      H3 = Thumbprint (hash) the public key of R3
      C2 = Self-signed certificate for R2, which contains H3

   This is an iterative process.  That is, R4 and H4 are generated when
   it is time for C3 to replace C2.  And so on.

   The successors to the Root CA self-signed certificate can be
   delivered by any means.  Whenever a new Root CA certificate is
   received, the recipient is able to verify that the potential Root CA
   certificate chains back to a previously authenticated Root CA
   certificate with the hashOfRootKey certificate extension.  That is,
   validate the self-signed signature and verify that the hash of the
   DER-encoded SubjectPublicKeyInfo from the potential Root CA
   certificate matches the value from the hashOfRootKey certificate
   extension of the current Root CA certificate.  If the signature does
   not validate or the hash values do not match, then potential Root CA
   certificate is not a valid replacement, and the recipient continues
   to use the current Root CA certificate.

3.  Hash Of Root Key Certificate Extension

   The HashOfRootKey certificate extension MUST NOT be critical.

   The following ASN.1 [X680][X690] syntax defines the HashOfRootKey
   certificate extension:

   ext-HashOfRootKey EXTENSION ::= {    -- Only in Root CA certificates
      SYNTAX         HashedRootKey
      IDENTIFIED BY  id-ce-hashOfRootKey
      CRITICALITY    {FALSE} }

   HashedRootKey ::= SEQUENCE {
      hashAlg        AlgorithmIdentifier,  -- Hash algorithm used
      hashValue      OCTET STRING }        -- Hash of DER-encoded
                                           --   SubjectPublicKeyInfo

   id-ce-hashOfRootKey  ::=  OBJECT IDENTIFIER { 1 3 6 1 4 1 TBD 2 1 }

   The definitions of EXTENSION and HashAlgorithm can be found in
   [RFC5912].

   The hashAlg indicates the one-way hash algorithm that was used to
   compute the hash value.

   The hashValue contains the hash value computed from the next
   generation public key.  The public key is DER-encoded
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo as defined in [RFC5280].

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requests of the IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations from [RFC5280] apply, especially the
   discussion of self-issued certificates.

   The Hash Of Root Key certificate extension facilitates the orderly
   transition from one Root CA public key to the next by publishing the
   hash value of the next generation public key in the current
   certificate.  This allows a relying party to unambiguously recognize
   the next generation public key when it becomes available; however,
   the full public key is not disclosed until the Root CA releases the
   next generation certificate.  In this way, attackers cannot begin to
   analyze the public key before the next generation Root CA certificate
   is released.

6.  Acknowledgements

   In the Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) [SET] specification
   published by MasterCard and VISA in 1997, a very similar certificate
   extension is described.  The SET certificate extension has
   essentially the same semantics, but the syntax fairly different.

   CTIA - The Wireless Association is developing a public key
   infrastructure that will make use of the certificate extension
   described in this document.
