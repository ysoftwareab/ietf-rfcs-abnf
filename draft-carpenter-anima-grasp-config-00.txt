1.  Introduction

   The GeneRic Autonomic Signaling Protocol (GRASP) is specified in
   [RFC8990].  It has a few parameters that might need configuration to
   non-standard values, but since any form of manual configuration is to
   be avoided in an autonomic network, this document describes how GRASP
   can configure itself within a given autonomic network.  For the
   general model of such a network, see [RFC8993].

   The method is for an authoritative source in the autonomic network,
   most likely associated with the Network Operations Center (NOC), to
   use GRASP's flooding mechanism to periodically distribute a GRASP
   objective (as defined in [RFC8990]) to all GRASP nodes in that
   network.  Each node will then validate the contents of the objective
   as much as possible, and then apply any relevant configuration
   changes locally.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "*MUST*", "*MUST NOT*", "*REQUIRED*", "*SHALL*",
   "*SHALL NOT*", "*SHOULD*", "*SHOULD NOT*", "*RECOMMENDED*", "*NOT
   RECOMMENDED*", "*MAY*", and "*OPTIONAL*" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only
   when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

3.  Format of the GRASP Objective

   The formal definition of the GRASP objective is as follow, defined in
   fragmentary CDDL [RFC8610].

   objective = ["GraspConfig", objective-flags, loop-count, objective-value]

   loop-count = 0..255         ; as in the GRASP specification
   objective-flags /=          ; as in the GRASP specification

   objective-value  /= { 1*gc-element }

   gc-element  = ( gc-element-codepoint => gc-element-value )
   gc-element-codepoint = uint
   gc-element-value     = any

   Initially, the following codepoints are defined:

      gc-element-codepoint //= ( &(sender:0) => ipv6-address )
      ipv6-address = bytes .size 16

   This provides the address of the original sender of the flooded
   objective.

      gc-element-codepoint //= ( &(sender-loop-count:1) => 1..255 )

   This provides the original loop count at the sender, so that the
   receiver can compute how many hops the flood has taken.

      gc-element-codepoint //= ( &(grasp-version:2) => 1..255 )

   At the moment there is only one version of GRASP.  This element is
   reserved for possible future use.

      gc-element-codepoint //= ( &(max-multicast:3) => 1..65535 )
      gc-element-codepoint //= ( &(max-unicast:4)   => 1..65535 )

   These elements can be used to change the default maximum message
   sizes for multicast and unicast GRASP messages respectively.  The
   sizes *MUST NOT* be reduced below the default specified by [RFC8990].

4.  Validation

   Upon receipt of a changed configuration element, each GRASP node
   *MUST* validate it to the extent possible.  The sender and sender-
   loop-count elements may be used as part of the validation process.

5.  Implementation Status [RFC Editor: please remove]

   An experimental Autonomic Service Agent (ASA) supporting the
   "GraspConfig" objective has been added to the Python prototype
   implementation of GRASP.  This ASA periodically checks for the
   flooded objective and reconfigures GRASP's multicast and unicast
   maximum message sizes accordingly.  Another experimental ASA has been
   implemented to periodically flood the "GraspConfig" objective as
   would be done by a NOC, based on a JSON file expressing the required
   configuration.  No problems were observed while running these two
   ASAs at the same time as other GRASP operations.  Code is on Github
   (https://github.com/becarpenter/graspy).

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new GRASP Objective Option name,
   "GraspConfig".  The IANA is requested to add this to the GRASP
   Objective Names Table registry defined by [RFC8990] (if approved).

   Open issue: Should IANA also register the gc-element-codepoints?  (A
   similar registration is described in [I-D.eckert-anima-grasp-dnssd]
   for the proposed "SRV." group of GRASP objectives.  Another option
   would be to change "GraspConfig" to "SRV.GraspConfig".)

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC8990] apply.

8.  Acknowledgements

   TBD
