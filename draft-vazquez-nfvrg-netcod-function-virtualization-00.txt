                 Network Coding Function Virtualization
         draft-vazquez-nfvrg-netcod-function-virtualization-00

Abstract

   This document describes network coding as a network function.  It
   also describes how a network coding function can be virtualized and
   integrated with virtual network functions architectures.  The network
   coding function is not a traditionally implemented network function
   in dedicated hardware as those that have triggered network function
   virtualization.  It refers to a novel network functionality that
   generalizes classic packet-level end-to-end coding.  Classic packet-
   level end-to-end coding helps in the provision of quality of service
   by trading off delay and reliability.  Network coding goes beyond
   that by enabling in-network optimized re-encoding, which can provide
   both throughput gains and diverse network-controlled degrees of
   reliability.  Consequently, a virtualized network coding function can
   serve as a flow engineering tool over virtualized networks (e.g. over
   network slices).

1.  Introduction

   Network coding(NC) is a novel technology that can be seen as the
   generalization of classic point to point coding to coding for network
   flows.  As with classic coding, both information theoretical and
   algebraic codes literature provide the conceptual solid basis of NC.
   Such conceptual basis has clarified NC benefits and corresponding
   tradeoffs, which need to be considered in practical implementations
   of the technology.

   NC does not replace end-to-end (packet-level block) coding, which is
   a well-established technology for the per-flow provision of quality
   of service by trading off delay and reliability.  Instead, NC
   provides coding within and across network flows relying on in-network

   re-encoding based on service-intent-oriented policy strategies.  By
   means of such policy strategies, the provision of quality of service
   that NC can offer can be tailored according to desired network
   service intent.

   For its operation, NC relies on having access to network, computation
   and storage resources throughout the network.  Such novel networking,
   computational and storage ingredients of a coding technology calls
   for novel practical design approaches to truly exploit the potential
   capabilities of NC.

   On the other hand, Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and NC can
   be seen as different ways to address different challenges in the
   design of upcoming network technologies.  Moreover, NC is not a
   traditionally implemented network function in dedicated hardware,
   which are the network functions that have triggered the design of NFV
   architectures.  However, in this document we show the feasibility and
   benefits of virtualizing the network coding function.

   The objective of this document is not to explain network coding
   technology.  The interested reader should find this information
   outside this document.

   The objective of this document is fundamentally two fold.  First, we
   show that NC can be designed as a (modular) network function.  The
   modularity is convenient for the user and is given as sets of
   elementary functionalities (toolboxes) that are defined independent
   of the physical network.  Second, we show that the NC function
   requirements of connectivity, computation and storage resources find
   a natural practical design solution in the integration of the NC
   function with available NFV architectural frameworks.  Such solution
   is described here and it combines network protocol-driven and system
   modular-driven design approaches.

   The resulting Virtual Network Coding Function (VNCF) can be useful
   for upcoming networking needs derived from network virtualization.

   Noncoherent Network Coding: Source and destination nodes do not know
   network topology and intermediate coding operations.  In this case,
   random network coding can be applied.

   Flow: A stream of physical packets logically grouped from the network
   coding perspective.  These packets may come from the same application
   (in that case they are identified by the five-tuple: source and
   destination IP address, transport protocol ID, and source and
   destination port of the transport protocol), or come from the same
   source host (in which case they are identified by the 3-tuple source
   and destination IP address, Type of Service (TOS) or Diffserv code
   point(DSCP)).  This distinction depends on the use-case where network
   coding is applied.

   Intra-flow coding: Network coding over payloads belonging to the same
   flow.

   Inter-flow coding: Network coding over payloads belonging to multiple
   flows.

   End-to-end coding : Transport stream is coded and decoded at end-
   points.

   Coding node: Node performing coding operations.

   Virtualized Infrastructure Manager (VIM): functional block that is
   responsible for controlling and managing the NFVI compute, storage
   and network resources, usually within one operator's Infrastructure
   Domain.

   Virtualized Network Function (VNF): implementation of a Network
   Function that can be deployed on a Network Function Virtualization
   Infrastructure (NFVI).

   Virtualized Network Function Manager (VNFM): functional block that is
   responsible for the lifecycle management of VNF.

   NFV Infrastructure (NFVI): totality of all hardware and software
   components which build up the environment in which VNFs are deployed.

   NFV Orchestrator (NFVO): functional block that manages the Network
   Service (NS) lifecycle and coordinates the management of NS
   lifecycle, VNF lifecycle (supported by the VNFM) and NFVI resources
   (supported by the VIM) to ensure an optimized allocation of the
   necessary resources and connectivity.

   NFV Management and Orchestration (NFV-MANO): functions collectively
   provided by NFVO, VNFM, and VIM.

3.  Network coding as a network function

   NC design involves different domains.  We can identify at least three
   domains:

   Coding domain - domain for the design of network coding codebooks,
   coherent or noncoherent encoding/decoding schemes, performance
   benchmarks, appropriate mathematical-to-logic maps, etc.  This is a
   domain fundamentally designed by coding theorists.

   Functional domain - domain for the design of the functional
   properties of NC to achieve the desired design requirements upon
   abstractions of networks and systems.  This domain jointly requires
   to consider physical-logical abstraction, identification of network
   coding application to either inter-flow or intra-flow network coding,
   service intent and related networking for the provision of quality of
   service.

   Protocol domain - domain for the design of physical signaling/
   transporting of the network coded information flow as one way or
   interactive protocols.

   The functional domain can be designed interpreting NC as a network
   function.  In order to provide the designer with sufficient
   flexibility, NC elementary functionalities can be grouped as a set of
   toolboxes that the designer can use.  We define the following three
   toolboxes:

   o  Coding/Re-encoding/Decoding Functionalities (CRDF).

   o  Flow Engineering Functionalities (FEF) performing optimization of
      available network resources to optimally perform NC to meet the
      service design targets depending on the (statistical) status of
      the networks (congestion, link failures, etc).

   o  Physical/Abstraction Functionalities (PAF) performing interaction
      with available storage and computation physical resources that are
      abstracted by the other toolboxes.

4.  Virtual Network Coding Function

4.1.  Virtualization of flows

   An important differentiating aspect of NC with respect to traditional
   networking technologies is the following.  A network flow for a NC
   network function is understood as a stream of physical packets
   logically grouped from the network coding perspective.




A. Vazquez-Castro, et al. Expires May 17, 2017                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft   Network Coding Function Virtualization    November 2016


   NC can optimize the NC operation abstracting such physical flow as a
   mathematical model, which can be subject of computational
   manipulation.  This makes NC to be naturally integrated into a
   virtualized framework of abstract entities such as virtual network or
   network slices.  This is because in the NC case, not only the network
   and resources are abstracted, but also the stream of packets is
   abstracted.

   Consequently, when interpreting NC as a functionality provided to the
   network, NC function virtualization simply consists of integrating
   the NC functional toolboxes described in the previous section into
   existing architectural NFV frameworks.  The virtualization of the
   network flow is managed by the NC function (CRDF toolbox), and the
   virtualization of all the functionalities described in Section 3 has
   no difference with respect to any other network function.

4.2.  Integration with ETSI NFV architecture

   Figure 1 shows our proposed virtual NC network function (VNCF).  It
   is integrated with the ETSI NFV architecture given the abstracted
   underlying physical system/network as part of NFVI.

   The integration naturally includes too exchanges between VNCF and
   NFV-MANO over reference points.

   Clearly, the functionalities of the FEF toolbox need to interact with
   the NFVO, VNFM, and VIM.  Note that the NFVO two main
   responsibilities of orchestration of NFVI resources across VIMs and
   the life-cycle management of network services, fit perfectly the
   needs of the FEF and PAF toolboxes.  Specifically, the FEF can obtain
   available network, connectivity and computation resources, geo-
   statistical status of the networks such as congestion, link failures,
   etc.  With these, NC operation can be optimized to meet the service
   design targets given the service-specific design constraints.  The
   optimization may result into manipulation of the (non-physical) flows
   and other flow engineering policies.  On the other hand, the FEF can
   interact with the VIM to obtain the allocation, upgrade, release, etc
   of NFVI resources.

4.3.  Example

   We describe here a high-level example of a general procedure of
   interaction between the VNCF and the NFV-MANO.  The NFV-MANO has
   repositories that hold different information regarding network
   services (NSs) and VNFs (VNCF is part of VNFs).  There are four types
   of repositories as follows:

   o  VNF catalogue represents the repository of all usable VNF
      packages, supporting the creation and management of the VNF
      packages.

   o  NS catalogue represents the repository of all usable NSs.

   o  NFV instances is the repository that holds details of all VNF
      instances and NS instances, represented by either a VNF record or
      a NS record, respectively, during the execution of VNF/NS life-
      cycle management operations.

Internet-Draft   Network Coding Function Virtualization    November 2016


   o  NFVI resources is the repository that holds information about NFVI
      resources utilized for the establishment of NS and VNF instances.

   Assume a network abstracted as a set of N coding nodes, each with
   encoding/re-encoding/decoding and (possibly) multi-link connectivity.
   A user of the VNCF wants to provide an ultra-reliable service (e.g.
   mission-critical communications) to the N nodes.  The performance
   objectives are given as a set of N reliability and delay objective
   performance metrics, which are geo-location dependent.  We call this
   VNCF instantiation as a virtual geo-network coding function (VGNCF),
   which is activated and its management and orchestration take place.

   A detailed interaction with the architectural blocks (some under
   definition) is as follows.
