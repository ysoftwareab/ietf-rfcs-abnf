Internet-Draft              An IESG charter                December 2002


1. Introduction

   The role of the IESG in the IETF management structure has been
   largely constant since 1992, when the structure of the Internet
   standards process was defined by RFC 1310 (which was later updated by
   RFC 1602, RFC 1871 and RFC 2026).

   Some of the functions were also defined in RFC 1603 (which was later
   updated by RFC 2418).

   As the community has grown, and the IESG has gathered experience, the
   way in which the IESG approaches its tasks has varied considerably,
   but the tasks have remained relatively constant.

   This document describes the tasks assigned to the IESG.

2. The composition of the IESG

   The IESG has the following members:

   o  The IETF Chair, who is also the General AD

   o  The Area Directors for the IETF Areas

   o  Liaisons

   The Chair and the Area Directors are selected by the IETF NomCom
   according to the procedures of RFC 2282 (Nomcom procedures).  The
   Liaisons are selected as appropriate by the liaising bodies.  At the
   time of this writing, the liaisons present are:

      The RFC Editor

      The IANA

      The IAB

   In addition, members of the IETF Secretariat are subscribed to the
   mailing list and present in the IESG meetings as needed in order to
   serve as a support function.

3. The IESG role in working group management

3.1 Working group creation

   The formation of working groups is described in RFC 2418 section 2.
   Each area director is responsible for ensuring that a working group
   being chartered is relevant, has achievable goals and constitutes an
   acceptable risk, has sufficient interest and so on.  The charter is
   the result of a negotiation between the AD and the prospective
   chairs, with review by the IAB and approval by the IESG.  Normally,
   there will be communication with the community of interest for the
   working group too.

   The AD is also responsible for selecting chairs for the working group
   that he thinks will be up to the task.

   The BOF procedure described in RFC 2418 section 2.4 also requires
   approval from the relevant AD.  A BOF is not required to start a
   working group, and a BOF may be held without the purpose being to
   create a working group.  BOFs are also often discussed with the IESG
   and IAB.

   If an AD determines that it is needed, he can take the initiative to
   create a working group.

3.2 Working group management

   The role of the Area Director in WG management is described in RFC
   2418 section 6.7.  The AD is responsible for making sure the working
   groups stay focused on the charter tasks, make forward progress, are
   coordinated with the rest of the area, and (with the IESG)
   coordinated with the rest of the IETF.

   In a well functioning working group, main responsibility for these
   things rests with the chairs; the AD will normally be able to
   concentrate on supporting the working group chairs' work.

   When a WG finds that it is essential that work gets done which is not
   on its charter, the AD is responsible for figuring out whether to add
   it to their charter, add it to another group's charter, task someone
   outside the WG to work on it, or initiate creation of another WG.

   The Area Director is also responsible for picking and, when
   necessary, replacing working group chairs.  This is usually done in
   consultation with the IESG.

4. The IESG role in document review

4.1 Working group documents

   This role is described in RFC 2418 section 7.5, and RFC 2026 section
   6.  The IESG role is one of review and approval.

4.2 Non-working group documents

4.2.1 Standards-track

   This role is described in RFC 2026 section 6.  Such documents are
   submitted to the IESG, which will assign them to a relevant area
   director.  The IESG is responsible for determining:

   o  Whether or not the specification is appropriate for standards
      track

   o  Whether or not the specification needs review by one or more
      existing WGs

   o  Whether or not the quality of the specification is adequate


4.2.2 Informational and Experimental

   These documents are usually submitted to the RFC Editor in accordance
   with the procedures of RFC 2026 section 4.2.3 and RFC 2418 section 8.
   The IESG is asked to review all documents submitted in this fashion
   for conflicts with the IETF standards process or work done in the
   IETF community; this is a modification of the RFC 2026 procedure, and
   documented in RFC 2418 section 8.

4.3 IESG review procedures

   The IESG review procedure is defined by the IESG.

   At the time of this writing, the procedure consists of:

   o  An initial review by the responsible AD, assisted by whatever
      reviewers the AD wants to bring to bear

   o  Once the responsible AD is satisfied that the document is worth
      sponsoring, a review by the entire IESG

   o  If the IESG has questions or comments, the responsible AD takes
      the token to resolve these with the authors or WG responsible
      before taking the (possibly revised) document back to the IESG for

      re-review.

   The IESG has web pages as part of the IETF web (www.ietf.org);
   current details of procedures should be published there.

5. The IESG role in area management

   The IETF divides its work into a number of areas, each comprising
   working groups that relate to that area's focus.  (RFC 2418 section
   1).  The area structure is defined by the IESG, and may be changed by
   the IESG.  The IESG decides which areas groups belong to.  When
   reassigning areas, the IESG can move responsibility for areas between
   IESG members, but the IESG can only add new members through the
   nomcom process.

   The primary task of area management is done by one or two area
   directors per area.  An area director may be advised by one or more
   directorates, which is selected and chaired by the area director (RFC
   2418 section 1).  Directorates may be specific to an area, specific
   to a technology, or chartered in some other fashion.

   The ADs for an area are responsible for making sure the WGs in the
   area are well coordinated, that there is coverage for the
   technologies needed in the area, and that the challenges that are
   most important to the Internet in that area are indeed being worked
   on.

   To that end, they may charter working groups, suggest modifications
   to working group charters, encourage people to work on specific work
   items within or outside working groups, or even shut down working
   groups that are not performing an useful function.

6. Other IESG roles

6.1 Staff supervision

   The IESG is the main body responsible for supporting the IETF Chair
   in supervising the work of the IETF Secretariat.

   The supervision of the IANA and the RFC Editor is handled by the IAB.

6.2 Process management

   The IESG is responsible for making sure the IETF process is
   functional in all aspects.  This includes taking responsibility for
   initiating consideration of updates of the process when required, as
   well as addressing obvious miscarriages of process even when it does
   not fall into the categories described above.

6.3 External relations

   The main responsibility for handling external relations rests with
   the IAB.  However, when technical cooperation is required, it is
   essential that the work be coordinated with the relevant ADs.  This
   often means that ADs will function in a liaison role with other
   organizations, but the same function may also be done by others when
   that seems more appropriate.

7. Security considerations

   The security of the Internet depends on standards giving proper
   thought to security.  Apart from that, there seem to be no
   considerations of security relevant to this memo.
