1. Abstract
   
   In this draft, we propose an architecture for the inter-area LSP setup
   based on criteria (combination of constraints). We derive the
   architectural requirements for the routing protocols, signaling
   protocols and the MIBs to support such an idea. We also demonstrate how
   such a mechanism will reduce the crankback during LSP setup. A possible
   outline of the modifications to the CSPF algorithm and examples are
   presented. In the companion document [INTER_AREA_EXT] we elaborate on
   the extensions required for such architecture.

3. Introduction
   
   Current work in the MPLS traffic engineering group (such as
   [TE_FRAMEWORK], [QOS_CONST]) focuses only on the intra-area LSP setup
   issues. In this work we propose an architecture to extend the traffic
   engineering capability across IGP areas and recommend relevant
   modifications to the routing protocols, signaling protocols and MIBs.
   
   The ISP's networks are divided into Autonomous Systems (ASs), where
   each AS is divided into IGP areas to allow the hiding and aggregating
   of routing information. Although this concept of hierarchical routing
   by an IGP makes sense from the routing perspective, it is a bottleneck
   for traffic engineering as it hides the path taken by a packet to
   destinations in the other routing areas. Hence, from the TE
   perspective, requirements such as path selection and crankback need
   different architectural additions to the existing IGPs and signaling
   protocols for inter-area LSP setup.
   
   Traffic engineering practice currently involves the setup and use of
   Label Switched Paths (LSPs) as dedicated bandwidth pipes between two
   end points. LSPs can be setup across several routers, either through
   the use of manually specified routes, or routes that are computed. The
   routes can be computed offline through the use of a dedicated tool, or
   through the use of online constraint based routing using an IGP
   [IGP_REQ, RSVP_EXT].
   
   The offline tool will be centralized, and has the advantage of being
   able to consider the traffic pattern history over a large period of
   time, and hence will be efficient in optimizing the resources over
   time, not just the particular instant when the request is received.
   
   The offline traffic engineering tool, if also used for LSP setup in
   addition to routing, may be able to optimize the resources across LSPs.
   This would include mechanisms to tear down LSP segments and reroute
   them when better resources become available or when new requests arrive.
   
   The online constraint based routing model [IGP_REQ] requires
   (1) a constraint based routing process implemented on certain LSRs that
   serve as LERs to the LSPs, and (2) a set of mechanisms to flood out and
   maintain the TE characteristics of the topology.
   
   From [TOOL_VS_RP] discussion, it is clear that traffic engineering can
   be implemented with the help of tools and routing protocol extensions,
   as initiated by [IGP_REQ]. Although there has been some work in the
   area of realizing some of the issues such as TE crankback [CRANKBACK]
   and DiffServ realizations [QOS_CONST], [QOS_TE_EXT], no work has been
   performed that is either directly related to the inter-area extensions
   or a framework for such in the TE working group.
  
   In our solution, we propose to send across IGP areas, the summary
   routes containing criteria-based route attributes, which will be used
   at the ASBRs in their TE path computation. Since an off-line TE tool
   cannot compute the complete explicit path from ASBR to ASBR unless it
   knows the complete routing table of the AS, we expect to have loose
   path specification, which can be translated into explicit path in-steps
   at the intermediate ABRs. The solutions we are providing in this draft
   are applicable to the destination networks inside the AS or outside the
   AS. For the sake of simplicity we consider the customer networks inside
   an autonomous system.
 
   In section 4, we present the outline of the architecture, which will be
   used to derive the routing and signaling requirements in section 5. We
   present examples in section 6 to consolidate the ideas presented in
   this document. Scalability issues of these solutions are discussed in
   section 7. Security considerations, acknowledgements and references
   follow in sections 8, 9 and 10 respectively.
   
   
4. Architecture
   
4.1. Definitions
   
   LSP section: An LSP section is that part of the inter-area LSP, that
   which lies completely inside an IGP area; the inter-area LSP is a
   sequence of LSP sections, connected at the ABRs. Each LSP section lies
   in a different area.
   
   Head node of the LSP section: The head node of an LSP section is either
   the originating node or transit ABR depending on whether the LSP
   section is the first or a subsequent LSP section.
   
   Criteria: A criteria is a combination of the constraints (as specified
   in the works in progress, such as [CR_ROUTING], [QOS_CONST]), which
   will provide a path setup mechanism to choose between different paths
   available between two end-points of the LSP.
   
4.2. Approach
   
   The current inter-area approaches try to setup an LSP across areas
   without prior knowledge of the resources available across the area
   boundaries. If the required constraints on the resources are not met,
   crankback schemes [CRANCKBACK] are used to backtrack to the previous
   nodes and take an alternate path. This may turn out to be expensive 
   in terms of the time needed to compute a new alternate path, and
   resources needed to maintain the state information to determine an
   alternate path (which is different from the current path kept as state
   information in memory).
   
   This draft presents an approach to solving the problem of LSP setup
   across IGP areas, through the use of the following components:
   
     -   IGP intra-area TE advertisements [INTRA_AREA, IGP_REQ]
     -   IGP inter-area TE summary advertisements [INTER_TE_OSPF,
         INTER_TE_EXT] and
     -   Extensions to the signaling protocols [INTER_TE_EXT]
   
   Our approach relies on the inter-area summary TE resource availability
   information to determine efficiently whether an inter-area path to the
   destination is at all possible with the constraints given. This inter-
   area TE resource availability information is obtained from the link
   state IGPs based on TE extensions [INTER_TE_OSPF, INTER_TE_EXT].
   
   These extensions provide a means to summarize the TE resource
   availability attributes of destinations outside an area and advertise
   these summaries into the target area by its ABR. Our solution is
   independent of the TE attributes that need to be summarized with some
   restrictions as discussed in the following sections. Since these
   summaries provide a clear picture of the resources available across
   areas, the probability of encountering a node (in another area) where
   resources cannot be allocated to the LSP, is minimized. The summary TE
   resource availability information also helps in determining the ABR
   that is "closest" to the destination in terms of the resources required
   for the LSP section. This determination is similar to the route
   calculation based on summarized routes across areas in the link state
   IGPs. Our draft presents a two criteria approach when selecting the
   ABR.
   
   At the originating node of the LSP, the ABR that is in the path to the
   destination with the most resources is determined using the TE summary
   LSAs. The originating node will then compute an intra-area path to this
   ABR based on the constraints. Such an intra-area path computation will
   be based on the intra-area TE LSAs [INTRA_AREA][IGP_REQ]. Once a path
   to the ABR is determined, an LSP is setup from the originating node to
   the ABR using the MPLS signaling mechanisms of RVSP-TE or CR-LDP. The
   signaling mechanisms of RSVP-TE and CR-LDP will be extended to carry
   the constraints of the LSP. Hence at the transit ABR, the original
   constraints are available for any further routing calculations.
   
   Once the first LSP section is setup up from the originating node of the
   LSP to the ABR (say ABR1), ABR1 will try to setup the next LSP section.
   If the final destination (of the inter-area LSP) is in one of ABR1's
   directly connected areas, the next LSP section is the last LSP section
   and terminates at the final destination of the inter-area LSP. Else, if
   the final destination (of the inter-area LSP) is in an area that can
   only be reached through another ABR (say ABR2), the next LSP section is
   a transit LSP section between ABR1 and ABR2.
   
   ABR1 will perform an intra-area route computation to determine a path
   for the next LSP section based on the constraints. ABR1 will then
   perform the signaling to setup this next LSP section. 
   
   If the LSP section just setup is the last LSP section, the constraint
   based LSP setup process is complete.
   
   Else, if the LSP section just setup is a transit LSP section to ABR2,
   the process of setting up an new LSP section toward the destination
   continues at ABR2, just like at ABR1. This process of setting up LSP
   sections is iterative, till the destination node is reached.
   
   If at any point in the LSP setup process an LSP setup is a failure, due
   to unavailability of resources, the LSP setup cranks back to the
   immediately preceding ABR.
   
   In an OSPF domain with no virtual links, a maximum of three LSP
   sections are possible (when the originating node and destination nodes
   are in different areas, neither of which is the backbone area).
   
4.3. Concept of criteria
   
   The LSP path setup mechanisms will use the criteria to determine the
   best possible path for the LSPs. We introduce the concept of primary
   and secondary criteria to determine the possible alternative paths for
   the LSPs. The application, which is requesting for an LSP setup, should
   be able to request for both the criteria, which will be used by the
   transit ABRs to determine the alternative path in case of a path with
   the primary criteria is not available.
   
   The concept of primary and secondary criteria is useful in the
   following cases:
   
     -  The resources to satisfy the primary criteria are not available in
        the intermediate areas - use the secondary instead of the primary criteria
        to reduce the crankback,
     -  The LSAs propagated by the IGP are not up-to-date and hence a
        failure occurs at the intermediate routers, and
     -  The intermediate ABRs make their own decisions based on the
        secondary criteria to reduce LSP setup time during crankback.
   
   The following are the guidelines for the proper operation of this
   concept:
   
      - The Secondary criteria SHOULD be a subset of the primary criteria
        or at least SHOULD be lower/inferior in terms of the resource
        requirements.
      - Both the primary and the secondary criteria SHOULD consist of TE
        attributes that are derivable from the summary information which is
        allowed to propagate across the ABRs, according to the proposed MIB
        requirements in the following sections.
      - The LSP constraints for the inter-area LSP can be a combination of
        several TE attributes, which can be satisfied during intra-area path
        computation. However, the primary criteria (and hence the secondary
        criteria) used for inter-area computations SHOULD be a subset of these LSP
        constraints so that the inter-area computations are not expensive.
      - Once a secondary criteria section is setup during path
        establishment, the remaining path computation SHOULD be performed based on
        the secondary criteria.
      - (Primary/secondary criteria, Primary LSP) SHOULD be complimentary
        to (Primary/Secondary criteria, Backup LSP), i.e., the primary and backup
        LSPs SHOULD not have any intersecting path.
   
4.3.1. Example for the selection of criteria
   
   Consider the following TE constraints:
   
     -  Class types [QOS_CONST],
     -  Available bandwidth [TE_FRAMEWORK],
     -  Color [TE_FRAMEWORK],
     -  TE metric [TE_FRAMEWORK],
     -  Delay,
     -  Number of hops, etc.
   
   A criteria can be a combination of the above constraints, such as
   (Class type 1, Available bandwidth = 10, Red color). If this is the
   primary criteria, then the secondary criteria should be a subset of the
   primary, such as (Class type 2, Color Red) where Class type 2 is
   inferior to Class type 1 in terms of "some" requirements. Also note
   that the available bandwidth requirement is also relaxed in the
   secondary criteria.
   
   Although it is not recommended that a summary LSA should advertise all
   the above constraints into other areas (from scalability point-of-
   view), note that for a  criteria to be accepted (either primary or
   secondary) for LSP setup, the criteria should be derivable from the
   summary LSA TE constraints. This poses the MIB requirements as
   mentioned in the above subsection on the guidelines.
   
4.4. The LSP setup process
   
   The process of setting up an LSP across areas is as follows. For each
   LSP section:
   
   1. At the source, a trigger to setup the primary and the secondary paths 
      is received by the LSP setup module.
   2. This module requests the routing module for a route to setup the 
      primary or secondary path.
   3. The routing module determines the closest ABR that has the best
      possible route based on the constraints, to the inter-area destination,
   4. The routing module calculates an intra-area route from the head
      node of the LSP section to the transit ABR that satisfies the constraints,
   5. The signaling module performs signaling and sets up the LSP section
      (intra-area) from the head node of the LSP section to the transit ABR.
   6. At the transit ABR, the signaling module transfers the constraints to 
      the routing module and requests a route for the next LSP section
   7. If the final destination is not in this area, repeat the setup
      process of 3, 4, 5 and 6 for the next LSP section, with the transit
      ABR at the head of the next LSP section. 
   8. If the final destination is in this area, calculate an intra-area
      route from the transit ABR to the destination that satisfies the
      constraints, then signal and setup the final LSP section completing 
      the inter-area LSP setup.
   9. If the setup of any LSP section is a failure, then crankback to
      the immediately preceding ABR and perform a new LSP section setup, up to a
      maximum of certain number of attempts.
   
4.5 Routing algorithm
   
   The routing process at the head node of each LSP section performs the
   following calculation:
   
      1. If the destination is in the same area, perform a complete intra-
         area route calculation based on all the constraints. If such a path is
         found, go to 4.
      2. If the destination is outside the area, do the following
         computation:
         2.1     ABR-list = {list of all ABRs in the area} -
                 {list of ABRs notified as ineligible via crankback}
         2.2 While (ABR-list != {}) /* do while ABR-list is not empty */
            {
                2.2.1 Use the inter-area TE summary LSAs to determine
                      the ABR with the greatest resources that satisfies
                      the primary criteria
                2.2.2 If no such ABR, break to 2.3.
                2.2.3 Use the intra-area TE LSAs to determine a path
                      to the selected ABR that satisfies all the
                      constraints of the LSP
                2.2.4 If such a path is found, goto 4 and start the
                      signaling process to setup the LSP section to the
                      selected ABR.
                2.2.5 Else, ABR-list = ABR-list - {selected ABR}
              }
          2.3 ABR-list = {list of all ABRs in the area} -
                  {list of ABRs notified as ineligible via crankback}
          2.4 While (ABR-list != {}) /* do while ABR-list is not empty */
             {
             2.4.1 Use the inter-area TE summary LSAs to determine
                   the ABR with the greatest resources that satisfies
                   the secondary criteria
             2.4.2 If no such ABR, break to 3.
             2.4.3 Use the intra-area TE LSAs to determine a path
                   to the selected ABR that satisfies all the
                   constraints of the LSP
             2.4.4 If such a path is found, goto 4 and start the
                   signaling process to setup the LSP section to the
                   selected ABR.
             2.4.5 Else, ABR-list = ABR-list - {selected ABR}
             }
      3. No suitable route was found and the LSP setup is a failure -signal
         back the error.
      4. A route was found, start the signaling process.
   
   In the case of backup LSP computation, the above algorithm applies with
   the following changes:
   
      1. In 2.1 and 2.3: ABR-list = {list of all ABRs in the area} 
	{list of ABRs notified as ineligible via crankback} - 
	{list of ABRs in the primary LSP}
      2. In 2.2.3 and 2.4.3, calculate the inter-area path that doesn't
         include any nodes in the primary path
   
   The following sections detail the requirements for the routing and
   signaling components, crankback and general applicability.
   
   
5. Requirements of the solution
   
   The requirements of criteria-based inter-area routing are separated
   into routing protocol requirements, signaling protocol requirements and
   other requirements.
   
5.1. Requirements for the IGP
   
5.1.1. Intra-area requirements
   
   The IGP SHOULD support [INTRA_TE] to advertise and distribute the TE
   information of the interfaces of the area. When there is a request for
   the setup of a constraint based LSP within the area, the IGP will
   determine the best path that satisfies the constraints by performing a
   CSPF computation on the TE resources of the area, as specified by the
   intra-area TE-LSAs.
   
   With respect to the setup of LSPs within an area, the constraints on
   the LSP can be one or more of the TE attributes flooded by the IGP in
   the intra-area TE LSA.
   
5.1.2. Inter-area requirements
   
   The Inter-area TE summary information is used by the route computation
   process:
   
      - to determine if a path to the inter-area destination that
        satisfies the constraints does exist, and
      - to determine the ABR to reach the next area.
   
   To do such a computation, the IGP SHOULD be able to support TE
   attribute summarization across areas, such as in [INTER_TE_OSPF] and
   [INTER_TE_EXT].
   
   To allow traffic engineering across areas, the ABRs of the IGP SHOULD
   perform TE attribute summarization; similar to the route summarization
   that is already a part of the link state IGPs. In the general case of
   TE attribute summarization, any number of TE attributes such as
   bandwidth, delay to a destination can be summarized. These attributes
   can be summarized through the use of a dijkstra or dijkstra-like
   algorithm depending on whether the TE attribute is an additive metric,
   or Max-Min metric, or some other type. The value of the TE summary
   attribute to a destination advertised by an ABR represents the TE
   resources of the best path available from the ABR to that destination
   based on that TE attribute alone. For example, the value of the
   summarized unreserved bandwidth attribute may be defined as in
   [INTER_TE_OSPF]:
   
   "The unreserved bandwidth to the summary destination is the largest of
   all path-unreserved bandwidths, each associated with a possible path to
   the destination. The path-unreserved bandwidth is the smallest
   unreserved bandwidth of all the links in the path. Hence, the
   unreserved bandwidth is the maximum amount of traffic that can
   currently be sent to that destination, the other traffic on the links
   being steady."
   
   
   The summarized TE attributes will be distributed inside the areas by
   the use of new link state messages for the purpose in OSPF and ISIS as
   defined in [INTER_TE_OSPF] and [INTER_TE_EXT].
   
5.1.3. Virtual links (TBD)
   
5.2. Signaling requirements
   
   The signaling requirements are divided into setting up the initial LSP
   (both primary and backup) and usage of the crankback facility during
   LSP setup.
   
5.2.1. LSP setup
   
5.2.1.1. Primary LSP setup
   
   Signaling SHOULD be extended to carry the criteria based elements, such
   as:
   
     -  Primary criteria (Attribute 1, ... , Attribute N)
     -  Secondary criteria (Attribute 1, ... , Attribute N)
   
   Signaling SHOULD trigger IGP computation for the explicit route in an
   area at the transit ABRs. If a path which satisfies the primary
   criteria is not available, then it should trigger an IGP computation
   for a path that satisfies the secondary criteria. It MAY inform the
   initiating node about the change in the criteria for the path set up in
   the intermediate path. This deliberate notification can also be derived
   when the actual setup is completed.
   
5.2.1.2. Setting up the backup LSP
   
   As this architecture distributes the LSP setup decisions, the
   intermediate ABRs SHOULD know the path taken by the primary and the
   backup LSPs. This enables the signaling component to request for a
   backup path that's different from the path taken by the primary LSP,
   during backup LSP setup. Hence, signaling SHOULD be extended to carry
   the complete path of the primary LSP when setting up the backup LSP.
   
   The same mechanisms used for the primary LSP setup SHOULD be used for
   the backup LSP setup also. During the computation of the backup LSP,
   the algorithm SHOULD consider the guidelines proposed in section 4.3.
   
5.2.2. Crankback during LSP setup
   
   Crankback in an area SHOULD always be performed from the upstream ABR
   of that LSP section. The mechanisms defined in section 5.2.1 will be
   used for the setting up of the primary or the backup LSP. If the path
   is not available, the information will be sent to the immediately
   preceding ABR to retry the setup.
   
   If the node that returns the error is itself an ABR, this node should
   not be tried in the following attempts. Hence, at the preceding ABR the
   routing process will determine a new route after pruning the previously
   selected but unsuccessful ABRs from the computation.
   
5.2.3. LSP section repair
   
   An interesting bi-product for this draft is the section repair. This
   draft considers repair of LSPs within a certain area - i.e., when
   the failure is in a certain an LSP section is detected (during the data
   transfer phase), an LSP section-level repair can be initiated. The
   error information is sent back to the immediately preceding ABR where a
   different path to the destination of the LSP section is determined, and
   a new LSP section setup is attempted. If successful, then the new LSP
   section is spliced in to repair the LSP.

5.3. MIB requirements
   
   The configuration requirements for such an architecture can be divided
   into:
   
      - Routing configuration, such as criteria filtering, criteria-
        constraint mapping etc.
      - LSP Setup configuration, such as primary criteria and backup
        criteria etc.
      - Signaling configuration, such as the criteria change in the
        intermediate segment notification, crankback in-progress notification
        required etc.
   
   These configuration items are further elaborated in the extensions to
   the inter-area draft for the signaling and routing [INTER_AREA_EXT].
   
6. Examples for the criteria-based route advertisement
   
   Let us assume that, as shown in Figure 1, an autonomous system has
   three areas, Area 1 with network N1, and area border routers ABR1, ABR3
   with area 0; and Area 2 with network N2, with area border routers ABR 2
   and ABR 4 with area 0. Consider the case when a router on N1 wishes to
   setup a criteria-based LSP to N2 with the primary criteria being:
   (required bandwidth = 10 Mbps and required interfaces = color red) and
   the secondary criteria being: (required interfaces = color red).

   Figure 1: An example for basic LSP setup across areas in an autonomous
   system
   
   The originating router and the area border routers calculate the
   primary LSP, primary criteria sections in their area. As shown in
   Figure 1, the sections PPS1, PPS3, PPS5 may represent the desired path.
   Similarly, the secondary path from N1 to N2 is PSS2, PSS4, PSS6. During
   the computation of the primary path, as a fallback when the primary
   criteria is not available (as on PPS3) the setup mechanism can take
   sections from secondary path (such as PSS7). Note that once the
   secondary criteria is used in a section, the later sections should also
   use the secondary criteria and convert the previous sections with
   primary criteria into secondary during the reservation phase.
   
6.2. Backup LSP creation example
   
   The same logic used in the previous case needs to be used except that
   the path selected for the backup should be non-intersecting with the
   above path. This can be done in a distributed manner if the primary LSP
   path is known.

   If PPS5 fails, as shown in Figure 2, the crankback can be done from
   ABR2 to by pass PPS5.
