   multicast over distributed mobility management (DMM) architecture,
   which considers the separation of the control and the data planes.
   This document describes three main use cases of IP multicast
   deployments over DMM depending on the placement of control and data
   plane functional entities.

1. Introduction

   Distributed mobility management is a new paradigm to solve current
   problems of centralized mobility management, such as a single point
   of failure, non-optimal routing [RFC7333].

   IP multicast is an efficient content distribution mechanism which is
   designed with the IP mobility to bring new user experience and
   reduce bandwidth cost. In the [RFC7333], one requirement for DMM is
   to enable multicast solutions to avoid the inefficiency in the
   multicast traffic delivery.

   Existing solutions for supporting multicast in DMM are bi-
   directional tunnel [TUNNEL] and direct routing [ROUTING]. These
   solutions focus on the placement of MLD proxy and multicast router
   functions into the Mobility Access Router.

   The current architecture of the DMM is being changed to employ the
   concept of data and control plane separation. The data plane nodes

   are configured by the control nodes via Forwarding Policy
   Configuration protocol, as defined in [I-D.ietf-dmm-fpc-cpdp]. The
   several deployment scenarios were presented in
   [I-D.wt-dmm-deployment-model].

   However, there is no work until now, mentioning about multicast
   support in such new DMM architectures. Therefore, this document
   presents possible deployment scenarios, which support multicast
   listener in the DMM architectures based on the concept of the data
   and control planes separation.

2. Functional Decomposition

   Two options for deploying the multicast over conventional
   distributed mobility management (i.e. without the control and data
   plane separation) are MLD Proxy and Multicast router [RFC3810]
   [RFC4605]. This section decomposes functions of MLD Proxy and
   Multicast router that are required to deliver the multicast traffic
   with the respect to the concept of data and control planes
   separation. Below table is represented about functional description
   for supporting multicast.

Internet-Draft    Multicast deployment scenario over DMM     July 2016


   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC4605] and
   [RFC3810]. Also, new entities are defined relying on the concept of
   data and control planes separation and the functional decomposition.
   Terminologies are similarly named as DMM functions defined in
   [wt-dmm-deployment-model].

   - CMA (Control plane Multicast Anchor): CMA consists of the control
      plane functions of the multicast router (Multicast Anchor). CMA is
      responsible for joining the multicast tree.
   - DMA (Data plane Multicast Anchor): DMA is the topological anchor
      point for multicast channels, subscribed by the MN. DMA provides
      packet treatment functions, such as packet forwarding, packet
      encapsulation. The DMA can be configured by the CMA via Forwarding
      Policy Configuration (FPC) protocol
   - CMN (Control plane Multicast Node): CMN is responsible for
      control plane functions of MLD-Proxy (multicast node) as described
      in the previous section.
   - DMN (Data plane Multicast Node): DMN is located at the first-hop
      router where the MN is attached. The DMN has the protocol
      interface with the CMN for configuration.

4. Use Cases Analysis

   Following defined terminologies, we adjust these entities into
   current centralized approaches which support multicast in
   centralized mobility architecture. Current multicast support
   approaches in centralized mobility architecture are defined in
   [RFC6224] and [RFC7028]. Since both approaches are based on PMIPv6,
   we use DMM entities which are mapped with PMIPv6 entities. Following
   table identifies the potential mapping of DMM function defined in
   [I-D.wt-dmm-deployment-model].

4.1. Use Case 1

     First use case is based on [RFC 6224], which LMA has a role of
     both unicast and multicast anchor in PMIPv6 domain. In that
     approaches, LMA  transposes any MLD message from a MAG into the
     multicast routing infrastructure and creates appropriate multicast
     forwarding states at its tunnel interface between LMA-to-MAG. 
     Additionally, LMA acts as a MLD Querier. MAG acts as MLD proxy
     which forwards multicast traffic and initiates related signaling
     down to the appropriate MN. In this approach, most importantly,
     mobility entities are tightly coupled with multicast support
     functions. In other words, there is no additional entities to
     support multicast besides adding more functions into their PMIPv6
     entities.
   
     Considering DMM deployment scenario with separation of control and
     data plane, two possible deployment models are existed. First
     model is that separated control and user plane model presented in
     Figure 3. In this model, the control plane function of multicast
     anchor is handled by the CMA and where as the data plane function
     is handled by DMA. The control plane function of the MLD proxy is
     handled by CMN and where as the data plane function is handled by
     DMN. Between control plane nodes, CMA and CMN, multicast related
     signaling messages are used to manage multicast group and make
     upstream/downstream interfaces to appropriate nodes. After a
     mobile node wants to join specific multicast channel and all
     related signaling messages are exchanged between control plane
     functions, control plane functions interact with their
     corresponding data plane nodes for the multicast traffic
     forwarding state management.

     Another possible deployment model is that centralized control
     plane model presented in Figure 4. In this model, the control
     plane functions of multicast anchor and MLD proxy are combined
     into a combined control function of DMM. There is no signaling
     messages between multicast anchor and MLD proxy. Between the
     control plane and the data plane nodes, FPC protocol defined
     [I-D.ietf-dmm-fpc-cpdp] can be used to managing forwarding states
     of multicast traffic.

4.2. Use Case 2

     In [RFC 7028], it separates multicast function into PMIPv6
     entities. Following that document, two approaches are proposed;
     Multicast Tree Mobility Anchor (MTMA) solution and Direct routing
     solution. In the MTMA solution, the MTMA is dedicated to multicast
     traffic and used to get access to remote multicast content. That
     is, the MTMA acts as multicast router or MLD proxy. When MN attach
     to this architecture and receive both unicast and multicast
     traffic, since the MAG connects to both unicast anchor (e.g. LMA)
     and multicast anchor (e.g. MTMA), MN can simultaneously receive
     both unicast and multicast traffic from same MAG. For that, the
     MAG should support MLD proxy function in [RFC4605] and maintain
     its upstream/downstream interfaces to appropriate nodes. For
     multicast traffic, a multicast tunnel is established between MAG
     and MTMA.

Internet-Draft    Multicast deployment scenario over DMM     July 2016


     Considering DMM deployment scenario with separation of control and
     data plane, MTMA approach can be described as Figure 5. In this
     figure, all multicast functions are deployed separately from
     unicast DMM function except access data plane function. In the
     access data plane, it maintains two forwarding states; unicast
     traffic forwarding states and multicast forwarding states. Unicast
     forwarding states are anchored by Home-DPA and multicast
     forwarding states are anchored by DMA. The control plane functions
     of DMM can be centralized and also the control functions of
     multicast can be centralized.

     Figure 5: MTMA solution model with separated control
               and data plane

     Direct routing solution in [RFC7028] allows the MAG to directly
     connect to a multicast router. In this case, there is no multicast
     anchor and the MAG acts as the MLD proxy. For multicast traffic,
     the upstream interface of the MLD proxy instance has been
     configured pointing to a multicast router internal to the PMIPv6
     domain. The MAG does not manage multicast group information. It
     just maintain upstream/downstream interface and performs MLD proxy
     operations defined in [RFC4605].

     Considering DMM deployment scenario with separation of control and
     data plane, direct routing approach can be described as Figure 6.
     In this figure, the multicast anchor function and the multicast
     access function are combined into single control/data plane nodes.
     In the access data plane node, it maintains both unicast and
     multicast forwarding states and interfaces to the appropriate
     nodes. Similar with the MTMA solution, the control plane functions
     of DMM or the control functions of multicast can be centralized.

5. Forwarding Policy Configuration for Multicast

     For communicating between DMM control plane and data plane
     function, Forwarding Policy Configuration (FPC) protocol is
     proposed in [I-D.ietf-dmm-fpc-cpdp]. FPC protocol enables the
     configuration of any data plane node and type by the abstraction
     of configuration details and the use of common configuration
     semantics. In recent document gives detail protocol attributes and
     operation parameters. Considering multicast support, we need to
     make sure that the current FPC protocol is resolved to create a
     forwarding rules for multicast traffic. For example, we can add
     identifier which represent multicast source address or add
     attribute for specific multicast group.
