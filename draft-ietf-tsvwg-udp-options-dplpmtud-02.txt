                    Datagram PLPMTUD for UDP Options
                draft-ietf-tsvwg-udp-options-dplpmtud-02

Abstract

   This document specifies how a UDP Options sender implements Datagram
   Packetization Layer Path Maximum Transmission Unit Discovery
   (DPLPMTUD) as a robust method for Path Maximum Transmission Unit
   discovery.  This method uses the UDP Options packetization layer.  It
   allows a datagram application to discover the largest size of
   datagram that can be sent across a specific network path.

1.  Introduction

   The User Datagram Protocol [RFC0768] offers a minimal transport
   service on top of IP and is frequently used as a substrate for other
   protocols.  Section 3.5 of UDP Guidelines [RFC8085] recommends that
   applications implement some form of Path MTU discovery to avoid the
   generation of IP fragments:

   "Consequently, an application SHOULD either use the path MTU
   information provided by the IP layer or implement Path MTU Discovery
   (PMTUD)".

   The UDP API [RFC8304] offers calls for applications to receive ICMP
   Packet Too Big (PTB) messages and to control the maximum size of
   datagrams that are sent, but does not offer any automated mechanisms
   for an application to discover the maximum packet size supported by a
   path.  Upper layer protocols (which can include applications)
   implement mechanisms for Path MTU discovery above the UDP API.

   Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery (PLPMTUD) [RFC4821] describes
   a method for a Packetization Layer (PL) (such as UDP Options) to
   search for the largest Packetization Layer PMTU (PLPMTU) supported on
   a path.  Datagram PLPMTUD (DPLPMTUD) [RFC8899] specifies this support

Internet-Draft                UDPO DPLPMTUD                November 2021


   for datagram transports.  PLPMTUD and DPLPMTUD gain robustness by
   using a probing mechanism that does not solely rely on ICMP PTB
   messages and works on paths that drop ICMP PTB messages.

   This document specifies how UDP Options [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options]
   can be used as a PL to implement DPLPMTUD (see Section 6.1 of
   [RFC8899]).  In summary, UDP Options [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options]
   supplies functionality that can be used to implement DPLPMTUD within
   the UDP transport service.  Implementing DPLPMTUD using UDP Options
   avoids the need for each upper layer protocol or application to
   implement the DPLPMTUD method.  This provides a standard method for
   applications to discover the current maximum packet size for a path
   and to detect when this changes.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119]
   [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown
   here.

3.  DPLPMTUD for UDP Options

   There are two ways an upper PL can perform DPLPMTUD:

   *  The UDP Options sender implementing DPLPMTUD uses the method
      specified in [RFC8899] and the upper PL (or application) does not
      perform PMTU discovery.  In this case, UDP Options processing is
      responsible for sending probes to determine a PLPMTU, as described
      in this document.  "An application SHOULD avoid using DPLPMTUD
      when the underlying transport system provides this capability"
      (Section 6.1 of [RFC8899]).  This discovered PLPMTU can be used by
      UDP Options to either:

      -  set the maximum datagram size for the current path (based on
         the discovered largest IP packet that can be received across
         the current path).

      -  set the maximum fragment size when a sender uses the UDP
         Fragmentation Option to divide a datagram into multiple UDP
         fragments for transmission.  Each UDP fragment is then less
         than the discovered largest IP packet that can be received
         across the current path.

   *  An upper PL (or application performs DPLPMTUD (e.g., QUIC
      [RFC9000]).  This upper PL then uses probes to determine a safe
      PLPMTU for the datagrams that it sends.  The format and content of

Internet-Draft                UDPO DPLPMTUD                November 2021


      any probe is determined by the upper PL.  Such a design should
      avoid performing discovery at multiple levels, so, when when
      configurable, this upper PL SHOULD disable DPLPMTUD by UDP
      Options.

   This section describes packet formats and procedures for DPLPMTUD
   using UDP Options.

4.  Sending UDP-Options Probe Packets

   DPLPMTUD relies upon the ability of a UDP Options sender to generate
   a probe with a specific size, up to the maximum for the size
   supported by a local interface.  This MUST NOT be constrained by the
   maximum PMTU set by network layer mechanisms (such as PMTUD
   [RFC1191][RFC8201] or the PMTU size held in the IP- layer cache), as
   noted in bullet 2 of Section 2 in [RFC8899]).

   Probe packets consume network capacity and incur endpoint processing
   (see Section 4.1 of [RFC8899]).  Implementations ought to send a
   probe with an REQ Option only when required by their local DPLPMTUD
   state machine, i.e., when confirming the base PMTU for the path,
   probing to increase the PLPMTU or to confirm the current PLPMTU.

4.1.  Packet Probes using the Echo Request and Response Options

   A UDP Options node that supports DPLPMTUD MUST support sending and
   receiving of the REQ Option and the RES Option.  When not supported,
   DPLPMTUD will be unable to confirm the Path or to discover the PMTU.

   This section describes a format of probe consisting of an empty UDP
   datagram, UDP Options area and Padding.

   A Probe Packet includes the UDP Options area containing a RES Option
   and any other required options concluded with an EOL Option followed
   by any padding needed to inflate to the required probe size.

   The UDP Options used in this document are described in Section 6 of
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options]:

   *  The REQ Option is set by a sending PL to solicit a response from a
      remote UDP Options receiver.  A four-byte token identifies each
      request.

   *  The RES Option is generated by the UDP Options receiver in
      response to reception of a previously received REQ Option.  Each
      RES Option echoes a previously received four-byte token.

Internet-Draft                UDPO DPLPMTUD                November 2021


   *  Reception of a RES Option confirms reception of a specific
      received probe by the remote UDP Options receiver.

   The token value allows a sender to distinguish between
   acknowledgements for initial probes and acknowledgements confirming
   receipt of subsequent probes (e.g., travelling along alternate paths
   with a larger round trip time).  This needs each probe to be uniquely
   identifiable by the UDP Options sender within the Maximum Segment
   Lifetime (MSL).  The UDP Options sender therefore MUST NOT recycle
   token values until they have expired or have been acknowledged.  A
   four byte value for the token field provides sufficient space for
   multiple unique probes to be made within the MSL.  Since UDP Options
   operates over UDP, the token values only need to be unique for the
   specific 5-tuple over which DPLPMTUD is operating.

   The initial value of the four byte token field SHOULD be assigned to
   a randomised value to enhance protection from off-path attacks, as
   described in Section 5.1 of [RFC8085]).

4.2.  DPLPMTUD Procedures for UDP Options

   DPLPMTUD utilises three types of probes.  These are described in the
   following sections:

   *  A probe to confirm the path can support the BASE_PLPMTU see
      Section 5.1.4 of [RFC8899]).

   *  A probe to detect whether the path can support a larger PLPMTU.

   *  A probe to validate the path supports the current PLPMTU.

4.2.1.  Confirmation of Connectivity across a Path

   The DPLPMTUD method requires a PL to confirm connectivity over the
   path using the BASE_PLPMTU (see Section 5.1.4 of [RFC8899]), but UDP
   does not offer a mechanism for this.

   UDP Options can provide this required functionality.  A UDP Options
   sender implementing this specification MUST elicit a positive
   confirmation of connectivity for the path, by sending a probe, padded
   to size BASE_PLPMTU.  This confirmation probe MUST include a UDP
   Option that elicits a response from the remote endpoint (e.g., by
   including the RES and REQ Options) to confirm that a packet of the
   size traversed the path.  This also confirms that the remote receiver
   supports use of the RES and REQ Options.

Internet-Draft                UDPO DPLPMTUD                November 2021


4.2.2.  Sending Probe Packets to Increase the PLPMTU

   From time to time, DPLPMTUD enters the SEARCHING state [RFC8899]
   (e.g., after expiry of the PMTU_RAISE_TIMER) to detect whether the
   current path can support a larger PLPMTU.  When the remote endpoint
   advertises a UDP Maximum Segment Size (MSS) option, this value can be
   used as a hint to initialise this search to increase the PLPMTU.

   Probe packets seeking to increase the PLPMTU SHOULD NOT carry
   application data (see "Probing using padding data" in Section 4.1 of
   [RFC8899]), since they will be lost whenever their size exceeds the
   actual PMTU.

   A probe seeking to increase the PLPMTU needs to elicit a positive
   acknowledgment that the path has delivered a datagram of the specific
   probed size and, therefore, MUST include the REQ Option.

   Received probes that do not carry application data do not form a part
   of the end-to-end transport data and are not delivered to the upper
   layer protocol.

4.2.3.  Validating the Path with UDP Options

   A PL using DPLPMTUD needs to validate that a path continues to
   support the PLPMTU discovered in a previous search for a suitable
   PLPMTU value (see Section 6.1.4 of [RFC8899]).  This validation sends
   probes in the DPLPMTUD SEARCH_COMPLETE state to detect black-holing
   of data (see Section 4.2 of [RFC8899]).

   This function can be implemented within UDP Options, by generating a
   probe of size PLPMTU, which MUST include a RES Option to elicit a
   positive confirmation whether the path has delivered the probe.  This
   confirmation probe MAY use "Probing using padding data" or "Probing
   using application data and padding data" (see Section 4.1 of
   [RFC8899]) or can construct a probe packet that does not carry any
   application data, as described in a previous section.

4.2.4.  Sending Packet Probes that include Application Data

   The method can be designed to only use probes that are formed of a
   UDP datagram that includes application data (which could be
   applications control information), padded to the required size and
   include a RES Option.  This implements "Probing using padding data",
   and avoids having to retransmit application data when a probe fails.
   This type of probe must be used when searching to increase the
   PLPMTU.  In this use, the RES and REQ Options do not form a part of
   the end-to-end transport data and a receiver does not deliver them to
   the upper layer protocol.  A simple implementation of the method



Fairhurst & Jones          Expires 29 May 2022                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                UDPO DPLPMTUD                November 2021


   might be designed to only use this format for all probes.

   The probe used to confirm the connectivity or to validate support for
   the current PLPMTU are also permitted to carry application data,
   since this type of probe is expected to be successful.  Section 4.1
   of [RFC8899] provides a discussion of the merits and demerits of
   including application data.  For example, this reduces the need to
   send an additional datagram when confirming that the current path
   supports datagrams of size PLPMTU and could be designed to utilise a
   control message format defined by the PL that does not need to be
   delivered reliably.  In this use, the RES and REQ Options need to be
   included by the sending upper layer and the values of tokens need to
   be coordinated with values used for other DPLPMTUD probe packets.
   These probes do form a part of the end-to-end transport data and a
   receiver does deliver the RES and REQ Options to the upper layer
   protocol.

4.2.5.  Changes in the Path

   A change in the path or the loss of probe packets can result in a
   change of the PLPMTU.  DPLPMTUD [RFC8899] recommends that methods are
   robust to path changes that could have occurred since the path
   characteristics were last confirmed and to the possibility of
   inconsistent path information being received.  For example, a
   notification that a path could have changed could trigger path
   validation to provide black hole protection Section 4.3 of
   [RFC8899]).

   Section 3 of [RFC8899] requires any methods designed to share the
   PLPMTU between PLs (such as updating the IP cache PMTU for an
   interface/destination) to be robust to the wide variety of underlying
   network forwarding behaviors.  For example, an implementation could
   avoid sharing PMTU information that could potentially relate to
   packets sent with the same address over a different interface.

4.3.  PTB Message Handling for this Method

   Support for receiving ICMP PTB messages is OPTIONAL for use with
   DPLPMTUD.  A UDP Options sender can therefore ignore received ICMP
   PTB messages.

   A UDP Options sender that utilises ICMP PTB messages received in
   response to a probe packet MUST use the quoted packet to validate the
   UDP port information in combination with the token value contained in
   the UDP Option, before processing the packet using the DPLPMTUD
   method.  Section 4.6.1 of [RFC8899] specifies this validation
   procedure.  An implementation unable to support this validation needs
   to ignore received ICMP PTB messages.

   This memo includes no requests to IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for using UDP Options are described in
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options].  The proposed new method does not
   change the integrity protection offered by the UDP options method.

   The specification recommends that the token in the REQ Option is
   initialised to a randomised value to enhance protection from off-path
   attacks.

   The security considerations for using DPLPMTUD are described in
   [RFC8899].  The proposed new method does not change the ICMP PTB
   message validation method described DPLPMTUD: A UDP Options sender
   that utilies ICMP PTB messages received to a probe packet MUST use
   the quoted packet to validate the UDP port information in combination
   with the token and/or timestamp value contained in the UDP Option,
   before processing the packet using the DPLPMTUD method.
