needSuccess = true, needAll = true:  doAll [doUntilFailure]
          In this case, all contained transactions must succeed.  If any
          failure occurs, the entire set must be rolled back.

needSuccess = false, needAll = true: tryAll
          With this combination set, the command responder must try to
          achieve all the transactions, however if any fail it is not
          required to roll back the rest of the transactions.  The
          failed transactions themselves, however, must individually
          revert to the before-write state.

needSuccess = true, needAll = false:  doAtLeastOne  [doUntilSuc¡
          cess]
          In this case, at least one must succeed for the transaction as
          a whole to succeed.  More importantly, if any one transaction
          component does succeed, processing MUST be stopped and the
          transaction as a whole is considered successful.  Another way
          to put it: at most one successful component is executed never
          more than one.

needSuccess = false, needAll = false:  tryAtLeastOne
          In this case, at least one must succeed for the transaction as
          a whole to succeed.  More importantly, if any one transaction
          component does succeed, processing MUST be stopped and the
          transaction as a whole is considered successful.  Another way
          to put it: at most one successful component is executed never
          more than one.  However, in this case even if none of the
          transaction components succeeds, the transaction as a whole is
          still considered successful.  It is impossible for a transac¡
          tion of this type to be considered a failure in itself.
