            Problem Statement for Identity Enabled Networks
                 draft-padma-ideas-problem-statement-01

Abstract

   The forthcoming deployment of 5G coupled with emerging applications
   such as augmented reality, virtual reality and 8k videos are likely
   to raise more stringent requirements in terms of ultra-low latency
   while ensuring session continuity.  The emergence of IoT services
   also raises new challenges (with respect to their interoperability,
   discovery, naming and addressing) which may lead to identity-based
   designs.  This problem statement examines how the existing solutions
   for networks whose forwarding scheme assumes the decoupling between
   the identifier and the locator information (called Identity Enabled
   Networks) will struggle to meet such requirements.  It advocates for
   a standardized, secured common control plane with data integrity for
   Identity Services such as identifier registration, mapping and
   resolution.  This memo also identifies several key areas to be
   further investigated for the architecture design of these services.

1.  Introduction

   The current Internet architecture was designed for an environment
   very different from today's networks.  The October 2006 IAB Routing
   and Addressing Workshop [RFC4984] identified several future trends



Pillay-Esnault, et al. Expires September 13, 2017               [Page 2]

Internet-Draft                                                March 2017


   and challenges.  [RFC4984]  suggests that a generic identifier-
   locator separation would be a possible solution to support billions
   of mobile devices without "bringing undue impact on global routing
   scalability and stability".  Indeed, the concept of identifier-
   locator separation is key to meeting future trends and challenges.
   At the same time, proposed solutions in this space do not currently
   address all requirements.

   The Routing Research Group (RRG) identified several identifier-based
   solutions in [RFC6115].  The technique relies upon the decoupling of
   the identifier from the locator and therefore the change of location
   is transparent to higher layers.  The changes of LOC are handled by
   an infrastructure that maps the ID to the LOC.

   As Machine to Machine (M2M) communications become more pervasive, IoT
   devices are slated to be highly interconnected and unsupervised.  As
   these communications will most likely be unmonitored, there are
   concerns regarding their discovery (privacy) , accessibility
   (possible breach) and data integrity (confidentiality).  Furthermore,
   the multitude of diverse IoT devices using different communication
   protocols may create siloed communications.  The sheer number of IoT
   devices expected to be deployed by 2020 will introduce new challenges
   that may be overcome by using the infrastructure of Identifier-based
   solutions.

   The deployment of 5G network infrastructures coupled with
   applications (such as augmented reality, virtual reality, 8k videos)
   are also putting more constraints, such as ultra-low latency with
   session continuity, on the underlying connectivity infrastructures
   [GSMA1] [GSMA2].  Identifier-based protocols can support mobility
   provided they have an efficient mapping service.

   Furthermore the vision of Network Slicing, that is a fundamental
   feature of the 5G systems, has evolved from a simple network overlay
   concept to enabling dynamic multi-service and multi-tenancy support,
   that transforms the networking perspective by abstracting, isolating
   and separating logical network behaviors from the underlying physical
   network resources.  The generic architecture proposed by IDEAS
   facilitates these applications, in particular the decoupling of the
   entity identifier from the locator can also help to select the
   optimal control plane and user plane as well as compose and allocate
   virtualized network functions inside the core or radio access network
   depending on the service requirements.  In the same way, the
   dynamically and on-demand virtual slices creation need an efficient
   mapping service between entity identifier and locator.

   This document examines the possible changes and improvements needed
   to address these challenges in Identity Enabled Networks (IDEAS).

   To provide some background, this memo gives a brief overview of what
   are Identity Enabled Networks.  Next, it describes the problem
   statement and advocates for a standardized common control plane for
   identity services, including identifier registration, mapping, and
   resolution services.

   Several key areas that should be investigated for the architecture
   design of these services and how they interface with current and
   future Identifier-aware protocols are listed.

   The goal of the work proposed by this IDEAS initiative is to provide
   a generic architecture that is scalable, extensible, robust, secure,
   and flexible for future networks.

2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Definition of Terms

      Entity : An entity is a communication endpoint.  It can be a
      device, a node, or a (software) process, that needs to be
      identified.  An entity may have one or multiple identifiers
      simultaneously.  An entity is reached by the resolution of one or
      more of its identifiers to one or more locators.

      Entity Collection: A set of entities with its own identifier,
      e.g., a multicast group, or an ad-hoc vehicular network that needs
      to be uniquely identified (e.g., a train entity may represent a
      Closed User Group (CUG) and may contain all the passengers'
      devices that share the same fate for connectivity).

      Identifier (ID): denotes information to unambiguously identify an
      entity within a given scope.  There is no constraint on the
      format, obfuscation or routability of an ID.  The ID may or may
      not be present in the packet whose format is defined by ID-based
      protocols.

      Locator (LOC): denotes information that is topology-dependent and
      which is used to forward packets to a given entity attached to a
      network.  An entity can be reached using one or multiple locators;
      these locators may have a limited validity lifetime.

      Identity: the essence of "being" of a specific entity.  An
      identity is not to be confused with an identifier: while an
      identifier may be used to refer to an entity, an identifier's

      lifecycle is not necessarily tied to the lifecycle of the identity
      it is referencing.  On the other hand, the identity's lifecycle is
      inherently tied to the lifecycle of the entity itself.

      IDentity Enabled Networks (IDEAS): IDEAS are networks that support
      the identifier/locator decoupling.  Reaching an entity is achieved
      by the resolution of identifier(s) to locator(s).

      Identifier-based (ID-based): When an entity is only reachable
      through one or more communication access then a protocol or a
      solution is said to be ID-based if it uses an ID-LOC decoupling
      and a mapping system (MS) as base components of the architecture.

      Identity-capable (ID-capable): An application is said to be ID-
      capable if it makes use of an Identifier of an entity to establish
      communication.  For example, an application that initiates its
      sessions using an ID.  An application may use an IP-address as a
      proxy for an ID if the network resolves this ambiguity.  We regard
      such an application as being ID-capable.

      Generic Resilient Identity Services (GRIDS): GRIDS is a set of
      services to manage the lifecycle of IDs, to map and resolve
      identifiers and locators, and to associate metadata (META) with
      entities and entity collections.  It is a distributed system that
      stores the ID, the associated LOC(s), and metadata (META) in the
      form of tuples (ID, LOC, and META).

      Metadata (META): is data associated with an Identity.  The
      metadata may contain information such as the nature of the entity
      for example.

      5G: Fifth generation wireless broadband technology [NEWS-3GPP].

      Scope: denotes the domain of applicability or usability of an ID.
      A scope may be limited (e.g., considered local with geographic
      proximity, or private within an administrative domain) or be
      global.

4.  Brief Overview of ID Enabled Networks

   The proposals of separating the ID from the LOC are not new.
   Location/Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP) [RFC6830] and
   Identifier Locator Addressing [ILA] solutions have been deployed in
   data centers (DC).  Host Identity Protocol (HIP) [RFC7401] has been
   deployed as a host-based solution.

   The use of mobile devices with critical applications and fast
   mobility introduce additional constraints to address the combination
   of the following requirements:

   a.  Ultra-low latency [GSMA1][GSMA2]

   b.  Session continuity

   c.  Mobility across heterogeneous multi-access networks

   d.  Network Slicing

   IoT device technologies introduce other constraints such as battery
   life (up to ten year battery life for low power devices [GSMA2]) may
   not allow connected devices to constantly signal their position or
   limit the way they communicate.  For example, in order to save energy
   a pet tracker may have intermittent one-way communication just to
   signal periodically its location.

   As the number of personal devices increases, they may be grouped in a
   cluster belonging to a closed user group or perhaps a class of
   devices.  There will be a need to identify such groups and register
   them for multicasting or broadcasting.  As the number of personal
   devices increases, they may be grouped in various clusters or closed
   user groups (depending on the nature of the IoT service and the need
   to manage small communities on the fly) or perhaps a service-inferred
   class of Devices (e.g., healthcare bracelets, heat sensors, infrared
   CCTV, etc.).  There will be a need to identify such groups and
   clusters, and register them for multicasting or broadcasting purposes
   (e.g., to optimize resource management when sending a set of
   commands).  Another example Energy management in smart cities may
   send commands to all lampposts that belong to different groupings
   (street or neighborhood).

   Therefore, any ID/LOC separation solution will require an
   infrastructure that secures registration, efficient discovery, and
   can manage complex lookups(e.g. all cameras of a brand in a factory
   floor) as well mapping/resolution services.

4.1.  Identifiers Role in a Communication Session

   The IDentity Enabled networkS (IDEAS) intend to define the use of
   Identifiers (ID) as follows:

   o  An ID is a way to identify communication endpoints of an entity.
      The ID of an entity abstracts its communication endpoints from its
      location.  There is a distinction as well that the ID to a locator




Pillay-Esnault, et al. Expires September 13, 2017               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                                                March 2017


      address mapping is a way to reach the entity but not tied to a
      specific interface address on the device itself.

   o  Even though IDs may be sent inside a packet, they may be encrypted
      (or not) and may not be globally routable.

   o  A single entity may have multiple IDs, and IDs of the same entity
      may have different life spans that are different from the lifespan
      of the entity.  Furthermore, it is understood that IDs may have
      different lifecycles, which may be permanent or ephemeral by
      choice or design.

   o  Ephemeral (temporary) IDs may be used as a short-lived pseudonym
      for a permanent ID to protect the privacy of the related entity.

   o  Involved entities may have multiple IDs that are used to initiate
      a communication .  Specifically, they are not just passive objects
      that need to be referenced and located in the Internet, but are
      live endpoints that may initiate a session while in motion or not.

   o  Finally, entities with these IDs may be moving over large
      geographical distances and across multiple administrative domains.
      Therefore, there is no guarantee that they will retain their IP
      address.

4.2.  Mapping/Resolution Services in GRIDS differ from Domain Name
      Service (DNS)

   The resolution of the ID into a locator is often mistaken as a NAT-
   like translation or even a DNS type of indirection.  Since the 1980s,
   DNS has been pivotal to translate human readable names that are easy
   to remember into hard-to-remember IP addresses.  It provides a global
   distributed directory service and is a very powerful and useful
   technology to translate the domain name hierarchy to IP address
   space.  ].  The use of DNS, as is, is therefore unlikely to meet the
   challenges posed to GRIDS.

   Even though the DNS was designed to be resilient, it is prone to DDOS
   attacks as discussed extensively in the Technical Plenary of IETF97.
   Furthermore, some studies have also described challenges in the
   response time and caching techniques and latency in the Internet
   [DNS1] [DNS2] [DNS3].  The use of a mapping system rather than using
   DNS system has been discussed extensively in [IVIP], [RFC6115] and on
   the lisp-wg mailing list [LISP-DIS].

5.  Key Problems

5.1.  Common Control Plane Infrastructure

   Today, most locator/identifier separation solutions rely on a control
   plane that resolves an ID to one or multiple locators.  Eventually,
   the control plane may be used to define other policies that are
   enforced by the devices that participate to the delivery and the
   operation of a connectivity service.  These solutions implement their
   own resolution methods.  The resolution service may leverage push-
   based protocols (traditional routing protocols and [LISP-SUBS]),
   pull-based control planes (DNS and LISP), third party software, or
   any combination thereof.

   Currently, each of the ID-based protocols uses its own specific
   mapping databases.  While ID-enabled data plane mechanisms may serve
   fundamentally different objectives and may not need to interoperate
   in the past, there is a potential benefit in providing them with a
   common interface for services such as registration, discovery, update
   and resolution and new services such as security or access control
   policy.  Furthermore, the lack of a mapping system with standardized
   invocation interfaces has the following downsides:

   a.  An impediment for the deployment of ID-enabled solutions.
       Indeed, it would be inefficient to deploy several specialized
       mapping/resolution network databases within the same
       administrative domain.  Furthermore, there will be additional
       expense and overhead to administer multiple proprietary mapping
       systems.

   b.  Difficulty to have an overall view of the network.  If multiple
       ID-enabled solutions with distinct mapping systems are deployed,
       troubleshooting may be difficult as the information may be
       located in different places.

   c.  Complex Management due to disjoint information spread over
       several mapping systems.  Operations such as merging networks are
       error prone and more challenging to detect and fix.
       Additionally, there will be considerable management overhead
       whenever devices migrate.

   d.  Barriers to the application of common and consistent policies.
       For example, in cross-platform IoT networking, brokering services
       may be needed to enforce routing/security/QoS/TE policies on
       behalf of partnering structures - service provider, energy
       provider, content provider, etc.

Internet-Draft                                                March 2017


   e.  Risk for fragmented connectivity.  A high diversity of mapping
       system variants will create silos of communications.

   f.  Complex cross-MS communications.  A common resolution system
       infrastructure may facilitate cross-MS communications.  Today it
       is difficult to communicate with multiple customized ID mapping
       systems with distinct interfaces.

   The common control plane may support limited or private scopes.  In
   addition support of private instances provides the necessary
   separation for specific users or applications.

   The emergence of dynamic (small-sized) communities or closed, on-the-
   fly, user groups puts additional pressure on the mapping system, from
   several standpoints that include robustness, availability,
   scalability and reliability.

5.2.  Identifier Lifecycle

   Currently, there is no guidance or allocation scheme for public IDs.
   Each protocol has historically assigned their ID independently, be it
   structured or not.  An agreed upon ID format and scope may facilitate
   cross-domain communication and simplify the implementation of some
   use cases to facilitate cross-silo communications or to better
   address the merging of networks

   The support of several allocation schemes by carving specific ranges
   within a name space and recycling should be explored for the future
   mapping systems.  The operations and ease of deployment should also
   be considered as they may influence policy enforcement schemes
   related to the allocation of IDs of the use of relevant metadata.

5.3.  Security of Mapping Systems

   As access to a mapping system may reveal the location and other
   sensitive information about an ID, any breach is therefore considered
   a security risk.

   Secured access and data integrity to current mapping systems may not
   be guaranteed.  It is possible to register erroneous information in
   some cases if the system is under attack [LISP-SEC].  Similarly, in
   the absence of DNSSEC, HIP RR is vulnerable [RFC8005].

5.4.  Distributed Denial of Service Attack Prone

   The DNS system is vulnerable to DDOS attacks.  The HIP protocol
   relies on DNS for the publication of public Host Identifier
   [HIP-ARCH].

Internet-Draft                                                March 2017


   The other current mapping systems are not specifically designed to be
   protected against a DDOS attack.  This is a potential issue as they
   have well-known IP addresses and registration depends on their
   reachability.

6.  Use Cases

   The use cases are discussed in detail in [IDEAS-USE].

7.  Relationship between IDEAS and other IETF Working Groups

   This document is meant to encourage the IETF community to investigate
   the opportunity of a new specification effort to address some
   specific problems from an ID Enabled Networks standpoint in general.
   The focus is to find a common solution and infrastructure that can be
   shared by current protocols and facilitate the introduction of new
   ID-based services while avoiding rehashing the same problems again
   each time a new service pops up.

   It proposes to address these problems with a Generic Resilient ID
   Services infrastructure which includes standardized access and
   multiple services.  The services include secured registration,
   discovery, updates with data integrity, mapping and resolution
   capabilities, define relationships between IDs or group of IDs,
   access control policy and security.

   Some other working groups are already working to address some
   specific limitations or enhancement of ID-capable protocols.  These
   working groups include LISP, HIP and NVO3.

   Protocols and architectures defined by these WGs may assume a mapping
   system or other resolution techniques, but they are not currently
   covering the other services mentioned in this document.

7.1.  LISP WG

   The LISP WG has been working on multiple mapping systems (ALT, DDT)
   for the LISP control plane and the primary function of this mapping
   system is to map and resolve the ID to IP addresses (EID/RLOC
   mapping).  Though some requirements are common, GRIDS has new
   specific requirements that are described in [IDEAS-REQ].

7.2.  HIP WG

   The HIP WG has based its resolution service on DNS and sections 4.2,
   5.3 and 5.4 of this document describe some of the vulnerabilities of
   this solution to address the requirement for fast mobility with low

7.3.  NVO3 WG

   The NV03 WG has been working on a mapping of VN names to VN IDs in
   the network virtualization space and their requirements differ from
   the wireless broadband requirements and cross-silo communications
   that have been mentioned in this document.

8.  Security Considerations

   Due to the sensitivity of Identity tied to identifier and locator,
   there is a need to pay attention to security ramifications.  In
   particular, the security goals should include confidentiality,
   possible encryption for integrity of sensitive data and privacy.
   Various aspects of security and the security requirements for IDEAS
   are discussed in TBD document.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
