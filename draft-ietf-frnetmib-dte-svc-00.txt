	1.  Status of this Memo
	
	This document is an Internet-Draft.  Internet-Drafts are
	working documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force
	(IETF), its areas, and its working groups.  Note that other
	groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-
	Drafts.
	
	Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
	months.  Internet-Drafts may be updated, replaced, or
	obsoleted by other documents at any time.  It is not
	appropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference material or to
	cite them other than as a ``working draft'' or ``work in
	progress.''
		
	To learn the current status of any Internet-Draft, please
	check the 1id-abstracts.txt listing contained in the
	Internet-Drafts Shadow Directories on ds.internic.net,
	nic.nordu.net, ftp.nisc.sri.com, or munnari.oz.au.
	
	This draft document will be submitted to the RFC editor as an
	extension to the Frame Relay DTE MIB. Please send comments the
	the author, copying iplpdn@cnri.reston.va.us.  It expires
	November 1997.


	2.  Abstract
	
	This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
	(MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-
	based internets.  In particular, it defines objects for
	managing Frame Relay Switched Virtual Circuit's.
	
	This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet
	community.

	3.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework
	
	The major components of the SNMPv2 Network Management
	framework are described in the documents listed below.
	
	o    RFC 1902 [1] defines the Structure of Management
	     Information (SMI), the mechanisms used for describing and
	     naming objects for the purpose of management.
	
	o    STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] defines MIB-II, the core set of
	     managed objects (MO) for the Internet suite of protocols.
	
	o    RFC 1905 [3] defines the protocol used for network access
	     to managed objects.
	
	o    RFC 1315 [4] defines the protocol used for managing
	     Frame Relay DTE's.

	The framework is adaptable/extensible by defining new MIBs to
	suit  the requirements of specific
	applications/protocols/situations.
	
	Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
	the  MIB.  Objects  in  the  MIB  are  defined  using the
	subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the
	SMI. In particular, each object type is named by an OBJECT
	IDENTIFIER, which is an administratively assigned name. The
	object  type  together  with  an  object  instance  serves  to
	uniquely  identify  a  specific  instantiation  of the object.
	For human convenience, often a textual string, termed the
	descriptor, is  used  to refer to the object type.

	4.1.  Frame Relay Extensions for SVC's 

	This MIB addresses the instances needed to be able to manage both the
	Frame Relay Forum's Implementation agreement for SVC's (FRF.4) as well 
	as the ITU's X.36 Specification [10]. A copy of FRF.4 is available
