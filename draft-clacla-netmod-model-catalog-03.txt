1.  Introduction

   YANG [RFC6020] [RFC7950] became the standard data modeling language
   of choice.  Not only is it used by the IETF for specifying models,
   but also in many Standard Development Organizations (SDOs),
   consortia, and open-source projects: the IEEE, the Broadband Forum
   (BFF), DMTF, MEF, ITU, OpenDaylight, Open ROADM, Openconfig, sysrepo,
   and more.

   With the rise of data model-driven management and the success of YANG
   as a key piece comes a challenge: the entire industry develops YANG
   models.  In order for operators to automate coherent services, the
   industry must ensure the following:

   1.  Data models must work together

   2.  There exists a toolchain to help one search and understand models

   3.  Metadata is present to further describe model attributes

   The site <https://www.yangcatalog.org> (and the YANG catalog that it
   provides) is an attempt to address these key tenants.  From a high
   level point of view, the goal of this catalog is to become a
   reference for all YANG modules available in the industry, for both
   YANG developers (to search on what exists already) and for operators
   (to discover the more mature YANG models to automate services).  This
   YANG catalog should not only contain pointers to the YANG modules
   themselves, but also contain metadata related to those YANG modules:
   What is the module type (service model or not?); what is the maturity
   level? (e.g., for the IETF: is this an RFC, a working group document
   or an individual draft?); is this module implemented?; who is the
   contact?; is there open-source code available?  And we expect many
   more in the future.  The industry has begun to understand that the
   metadata related to YANG models become equally important as the YANG
   models themselves.

   This document defines a YANG [RFC7950] module called yang-
   catalog.yang that contains the metadata definitions that are
   complementary to the related YANG modules themselves.  The design for
   this module is based on experience and real code.  As such, it's
   expected that this YANG module will be a living document.
   Furthermore, new use cases, which require new metadata in this YANG
   module, are discovered on a regular basis.

   The yangcatalog.org instantiation of the catalog provides a means for
   module authors and vendors implementing modules to upload their
   metadata, which is then searchable via an API, as well as using a
   variety of web-based tools.  The instructions for contributing and
   searching for metadata can be found at <https://www.yangcatalog.org/
   contribe.php>.

1.1.  Status of Work and Open Issues

   The top open issues are:

   1.  Obtain feedback from vendors and SDOs

   2.  Socialize module at the IETF and incorporate feedback

   3.  Provide module bundle support

2.  Learning from Experience

   While implementing the catalog and tools at yangcatalog.org, we
   initially looked at the "Catalog and registry for YANG models"
   [I-D.openconfig-netmod-model-catalog] as a starting point but we

Internet-Draft                YANG Catalog                    April 2018


   quickly realized that the objectives are different.  As a
   consequence, even if some of the information is similar, this YANG
   module started to diverge.  Below are the justifications for the
   divergence, our observations, and our learning experience as we have
   been developing and getting feedback.

2.1.  YANG Module Library

   In order for the YANG catalog to become a complete inventory of which
   models are supported on the different platforms, content such as the
   support of the YANG module/deviation/feature/etc. should be easy to
   import and update.  An easy way to populate this information is to
   have a similar structure as the YANG Module Library [RFC7895].  That
   way, querying the YANG Module Library from a platform provides,
   directly in the right format, the input for the YANG catalog
   inventory.

   There are some similar entries between the YANG Module Library and
   the Openconfig catalog.  For example, the Openconfig catalog model
   defines a "uri" leaf which is similar to "schema" from [RFC7895]).
   And this adds to the overall confusion.

2.2.  YANG Catalog Data Model

   The structure of the yang-catalog.yang module described in this
   document is found below.  The meaning of the symbols in this and
   seubsequent tree diagrams in this document is explained in

   Various elements of this module tree will be discussed in the
   subsequent sections.

2.3.  Module Sub-Tree

   Each module in the YANG Catalog is enumerated by its metadata and by
   various vendor implementations.  While initially each module used the
   "module-list" grouping from the YANG Library [RFC7895], it was found
   that some of the nodes within that grouping such as "conformance-
   type", "feature", and "deviation" are only valid when a module is
   implemented by a server.  As pure YANG data (which the Catalog is) it
   is not possible to provide meaningful values for those nodes.  As
   such, common leafs were extracted from the YANG Library's "module-
   list" for use in the module sub-tree of yang-catalog.  Those server-
   specific nodes are moved under the implementation sub-tree.  The
   yang-catalog module then augments these common nodes to add metadata
   elements that aid module developers and module consumers alike in
   understanding the relative maturity, compilation status, and the
   support contact(s) of each YANG module.

   Many of these additional metadata fields are self-explanatory,
   especially given their descriptions in the module itself and the fact
   that many elements translate directly to YANG schema elements.
   However, those requiring additional explanation or context as to why
   they are needed are described in the subsequent sections.

2.4.  Compilation Information

   For the inventory to be complete, YANG modules at different stages of
   their lifecyle should be taken into account, including YANG modules
   that are clearly works-in-progress (i.e., that do not validate
   correctly either because of faulty YANG constructs, because of a
   faulty imported YANG module, or simply because of warnings).  The
   results of compilation testing are denoted in the "compilation-
   status" leaf with links to the output of the tests stored in the
   "compilation-result" leaf.  Note that some warnings seen in
   "compilation-result" are not always show-stoppers from a code
   generation point of view (see the Generated From section).
   Nonetheless, the compilation or validation status, along with the
   compilation output, provide a clear indication of a given YANG
   module's development phase and stability.  The current set of
   validator is pyang, confdc, yangdump-pro, and yanglint.

   The current instantiation of the YANG Catalog at
   <https://www.yangcatalog.org> uses a number of different YANG
   compilers for testing.  The wrapper that handles validation attempts
   to use metadata from the catalog to determine which tests to perform
   on a given module.  For example, if the module is authored by the
   IETF, IETF-specific tests will be conducted to provide the most
   accurate and complete set of tests possible.

2.5.  Maturity Level

   Models also have inherent maturity levels from their respective
   Standards Development Organizations (SDOs).  These maturity levels
   help module consumers understand how complete, tested, etc. a module
   is.

leaf maturity-level {
type enumeration {
enum ratified {
  description
    "Maturity of a module that is fully approved (e.g., a standard).";
}
enum adopted {
  description
    "Maturity of a module that is actively being developed by a organization towards ratification.";
}
enum initial {
  description
    "Maturity of a module that has been initially created, but has no official
     organization-level status.";
}
enum not-applicable {
  description
    "The maturity level is not used for vendor-supplied models, and thus all vendor
     modules will have a maturity of not-applicable";
}
}
description
"The current maturity of the module with respect to the body that created it.
 This allows one to understand where the module is in its overall life cycle.";
}

   This enumeration mapping has been implemented for the YANG modules
   from IETF and BBF.  The "maturity-level" MUST be "not-applicable" for
   all vendor-authored modules.

   In addition to a module's maturity, modules that are part of works-
   in-progress (e.g., IETF internet drafts) may expire if work ceases on
   the related document.  To track that, the catalog has two module
   leafs: "expires" and "expired".  The "expires" leaf indicates a date
   and time when the module is expected to expire whereas the "expired"
   leaf indicates whether or not the module has already expired.  For
   those modules that will never expire, the "expired" leaf MUST be set
   to "not-applicable".

2.6.  Generated From

   While many models are written by hand (i.e., authored by humans)
   others are generated from things such as vendor code or CLI
   constructs or from SMI-based MIB modules.  These "generated" modules
   do not necessarily require the same stringent validity checking that
   hand-written modules require.  As such, these modules have a
   generated-from value that is designed to inform validators how much
   checking to do.

        leaf generated-from {
          type enumeration {
            enum "mib" {
              description
                "Module generated from Structure of Management Information (SMI)
                 MIB per RFC6643.";
            }
            enum "not-applicable" {
              description
                "Module was not generated but it was authored manually.";
            }
            enum "native" {
              description
                "Module generated from platform internal,
                 proprietary structure, or code.";
            }
          }
          default "not-applicable";
          description
            "This statement defines weather the module was generated or not.
             Default value is set to not-applicable, which means that module
             was created manualy and not generated.";
        }

2.7.  Implementation

   As of version 02 of openconfig-model-catalog.yang
   [I-D.openconfig-netmod-model-catalog] it is not possible to identify
   the implementations of one specific module.  Instead modules are
   grouped into feature-bundle, and feature-bundles are implemented by
   devices.  Because of this, we added our own implementation sub-tree
   under each module to yang-catalog.yang.  Our implementation sub-tree
   is:

+--rw implementation* [vendor platform software-version software-flavor]
 +--rw vendor              string
 +--rw platform            string

 +--rw software-flavor     string

 +--rw deviation* [name revision]
 |  +--rw name        yang:yang-identifier
 |  +--rw revision    union
 +--rw conformance-type?   enumeration

   The keys in this sub-tree can be used in the "vendor" sub-tree
   defined below to walk through each vendor, platform, and software
   release to get a full list of supported YANG modules for that
   release.

   The "software-flavor" key leaf identifies a variation of a specific
   version where YANG model support may be different.  Depending on the
   vendor, this could be a license, additional software component, or a
   feature set.

   The other non-key leaves in the implementation sub-tree represent
   optional elements of a software release that some vendors may choose
   to use for informational purposes.  These leafs are duplicated under
   the vendor sub-tree.

2.8.  Vendor Sub-Tree

   The vendor sub-tree provides a way, especially for module consumers,
   to walk through a specific device and software release to find a list
   of modules supported therein.  This sub-tree turns the
   "implementation" sub-tree on its head to provide an optimized index
   for one wanting to go from a platform to a full list of modules.

   In addition to the module list, the vendor sub-tree lists the YANG-
   based protocols (e.g., NETCONF or RESTCONF) that the platforms
   support.

                                   +--rw conformance-type?   enumeration

   This sub-tree structure also enables one to look for YANG modules for
   a class of platforms (e.g., list of modules for Cisco, or list of
   modules for Cisco ASR9K routers) instead of only being able to look
   for YANG modules for a specific platform and software release.

2.9.  Regex Expression Differences

   Another challenge encountered when trying to using
   [I-D.openconfig-netmod-model-catalog] as the canonical catalog is the
   regular expression syntax it uses.  The Openconfig module uses a
   POSIX-compliant regular expression syntax whereas YANG-based protocol
   implementations like ConfD [1] expect the IETF-chosen W3C syntax.  In
   order to load the Openconfig catalog in such engines, changes to the

Internet-Draft                YANG Catalog                    April 2018


   regular expression syntax had to be done, and these one-off changes
   are not supportable.

3.  YANG Catalog Use Cases

   The YANG Catalog module is currently targeted to address the
   following use cases.

3.1.  YANG Search Metadata

   The yangcatalog.org toolchain provides a service for searching [2]
   for YANG modules based on keywords.  The resulting search data
   currently stores the module and node metadata in a proprietary format
   along with the search index data.  By populating the yang-catalog
   module, this search service can instead pull the metadata from the
   implementation of the module.  Populating this instance of the yang-
   catalog module will be using an API that is still under development,
   but will ultimately allow SDOs and vendors to provide metadata and
   ensure the search service has the most up-to-date data for all
   available modules.

3.2.  Identify YANG Module Support in Devices

   By organizing the yang-catalog module so that one can either find all
   implementations for a given module, or find all modules supported by
   a vendor platform and software release, the catalog will provide a
   straight-forward way for one to understand the extent of YANG module
   support in participating vendors' software releases.  Eventually a
   web-based graphical interface will be connected to this on
   yangcatalog.org to make it easier for consumers to leverage the
   instance of the yang-catalog module for this use case.

3.3.  Identify The Backward Compatibility between YANG Module Revisions

   The YANG catalog contains not only the most up-to-date YANG module
   revision of a given module, but keeps all previous revisions as well.
   With APIs in mind, it's important to understand whether different
   YANG module revisions are backward compatible (this is specifically
   imported for native YANG modules, i.e. the ones where generated-from
   = native).  This document uses the following semver.org semantic
   [semver] to compare the YANG module backwards (in)compatibility:

      MAJOR is incremented when the new version of the specification is
      incompatible with previous versions.

      MINOR is incremented when new functionality is added in a manner
      that is backward-compatible with previous versions.

Internet-Draft                YANG Catalog                    April 2018


      PATCH is incremented when bug fixes are made in a backward-
      compatible manner.

   Two distinct leaves in the YANG module contains this semver semantic:

      the semantic-version leaf contains the value reported as metadata
      by a specific YANG module.

      the derived-semantic-version leaf is established by examining the
      the YANG module themselves.  As such, only the YANG syntax, as
      opposed to the implementation changes that lead some some semantic
      changes.

   Typically, an Openconfig YANG module would contain an extension,
   which is mapped to the semantic-version leaf.

       description
         "The OpenConfig version number for the module. This is
         expressed as a semantic version number of the form:
           x.y.z
          where:
           * x corresponds to the major version,
           * y corresponds to a minor version,
           * z corresponds to a patch version.
         This version corresponds to the model file within which it is
         defined, and does not cover the whole set of OpenConfig models.
         Where several modules are used to build up a single block of
         functionality, the same module version is specified across each
         file that makes up the module.

         A major version number of 0 indicates that this model is still
         in development (whether within OpenConfig or with industry
         partners), and is potentially subject to change.

         Following a release of major version 1, all modules will
         increment major revision number where backwards incompatible
         changes to the model are made.

         The minor version is changed when features are added to the
         model that do not impact current clients use of the model.

         The patch-level version is incremented when non-feature changes
         (such as bugfixes or clarifications to human-readable
         descriptions that do not impact model functionality) are made
         that maintain backwards compatibility.

         The version number is stored in the module meta-data.";
     }

   Note that the absolute numbers in the semantic-version and derived-
   semantic-version are actually meaningless: the difference between two
   YANG module semver fields should be looked at.

   In addition to the semantic versions, the yang-tree field points to
   the respective module's simplified graphical representation of its
   model as described by [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-tree-diagrams].  This
   diagram can be compared between two revisions of the same module to
   visually determine any structural differences when MAJOR or MINOR
   semantic versions differ.

5.  Security Considerations

   The goal of the YANG Catalog module and yangcatalog.org is to
   document a large library of YANG modules and their implementations.
   Already, we have seen some SDOs hestitant to provide modules that
   have not reached a "ratified" maturity level because of intellectual
   property leakage concerns or simply organization process that
   mandates only fully ratified modules can be published.  Care must be
   paid that through private automated testing and validation of such
   modules that their metadata does not leak before the publishing
   organization approves the release of such data.

   Similarly, from a vendor implementation standpoint, data that is
   exposed to the catalog before the vendor has fully vetted it could
   cause confusion amongst that vendor's customers or reveal product
   releases to the market before they have been officially announced.

   Ultimately, there is a balance to be struck with respect to providing
   a rich library of YANG module metadata, and doing so at the right
   time to avoid information leakage.

6.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA action is requested.

Appendix B.  Changes From Previous Revisions

   RFC Editor to remove this section prior to publication.

   Draft -00 to -01:

   o  Redesign of module sub-tree based on review.

   o  Modularize some leafs and create typedefs to share with API YANG
      modules.

   o  Add module conformance-type, deviation and feature leafs under the
      implementation branch.

   o  Change yang-version to be an enum.

   o  Add a leaf for module-classification based on [RFC8199].

   o  Normalize enums to be lowercase.

   o  Use identities for protocols instead of an enumeration.

   o  Make conformance-type optional as not all vendors implement
      [RFC7895].

   o  Add a leaf for tree-type based on [RFC8342].

   o  Add a reference to contributing to the YANG Catalog at
      yangcatalog.org.

   o  Various wording and style changes to the document text.

   Draft -01 to -02:

   o  Add a belongs-to leaf to track parent modules.

   o  Add leafs to track dependents and dependencies for a given module.

   o  Simplify the generated-from enumerated values.

   o  Refine the type for compilation-result to be an inet:uri.

   o  Add leafs for semantic versioning.

   o  Reorder the organization leaf to be with other module keys.

   o  Add text to describe generated-from and semantic versioning.

   Draft -02 to -03:

   o  Change YANG ref to RFC7950 as the catalog module now needs YANG
      1.1.

   o  Add a reference to I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-tree-diagrams.

   o  Document the new yang-tree node in the catalog.

   o  Document the new expires and expired leafs and their relation to
      maturity.

   o  Updtae NMDA reference to point to new RFC number.
