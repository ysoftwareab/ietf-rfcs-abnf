Abstract 

   The purpose of this draft is to describe a methodology specific to 
   the benchmarking of MPLS imposition, forwarding and disposition 
   devices. The scope of this benchmarking will be limited to various 
   types of packet-forwarding and delay measurements. It builds upon the 
   tenets set forth in RFC2544, RFC1242 and other IETF Benchmarking 
   Methodology Working Group (BMWG) efforts.  This document seeks to 
   extend these efforts into the MPLS paradigm.

   The BMWG produces two major classes of documents: Benchmarking 
   Terminology documents and Benchmarking Methodology documents.  The 
   Terminology documents present the benchmarks and other related terms. 
   The Methodology documents define the procedures required to collect 
   the benchmarks cited in the corresponding Terminology documents.

1. Introduction 

   Over the past several years MPLS networks have gained greater 
   popularity, however there is no standard method to compare and 
   contrast the varying implementations and their strong and weak 
   points. This document proposes several criteria and a methodology for 
   the comparison of various implementations of basic MPLS forwarding 
   devices.

2. Document Scope 

   Generic MPLS is a foundation enabling technology for other more 
   advanced technologies such as IPv4 MPLS-VPNS, Layer 2 VPNs, and MPLS 
   Traffic Engineering. This document will limit it self to only generic 
   MPLS such as basic label forwarding and LDP for control-plane 
   activities. Child technologies will be covered in a subsequent set of 
   documents.  

3. Key Words to Reflect Requirements 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 
   [Br97].  RFC 2119 defines the use of these key words to help make the 
   intent of standards track documents as clear as possible.  While this 
   document uses these keywords, this document is not a standards track 
   document. 

4. Test Setup 

   The set of methodologies described in this document will use the 
   topologies described in this section. An effort has been made to 
   exclude superfluous equipment needs such that each test can be 
   carried out with the minimum number of requirements.

   Where (x) is determined by the maximum unidirectional forwarding 
   throughput of the DUT and the load capacity of the media between the 
   Test Ports and DUT. For example, if the DUT's forwarding throughput 
   is 100 frames per second (fps), and the media capacity is 50 fps than 
   x = 2.  

   The minimum value for Bx is 2, as multiple B interfaces are needed 
   for head of line blocking testing (Section TBD).  

4.1. Test Considerations 

   This methodology assumes a full-duplex uniform medium topology. The 
   medium used MUST be reported in each test result. Issues regarding 
   mixed transmission media, speed mismatches, media header differences 
   etc, are not under consideration. Flow control, QoS, Graceful Restart 
   and other non-essential traffic or traffic-effecting features MUST be 
   disabled, unless explicitly requested by the test case. 

4.1.1. IGP Support 

   It is highly RECOMMENDED that all of the interfaces (A1, DA1, DB1, 
   A2..) support an IGP such as IS-IS or OSPF. While technically, MPLS 
   can work in conjunction with RIP, EIGRP, or static routes etc, 
   practically, devices will be used with either OSPF or IS-IS. 
   Furthermore, there are testing considerations in this document that 
   the device is able to provide a stable control-plane during heavy 
   forwarding workloads. The route distribution method used (OSPF, IS-
   IS, static) MUST be repoted. 

    

4.1.2. LDP Support 

   The DUT must support at least one protocol for exchanging MPLS 
   labels. The most commonly used protocol is Label Distribution 
   Protocol (LDP) [RFC3036]. All of the interfaces connected to the DUT 
   such as A1, DA1, DB1, A2 etc., MUST support Label Distribution 
   Protocol (LDP) for IPv4 or IPv6 FECs. The test traffic generator will 
   need to learn and advertise labels from and to the DUT using LDP. 

4.1.3. Frame Sizes 

   Each test SHOULD be run with different frame sizes in different 
   trials. For Ethernet, the recommended sizes (in bytes) are 64, 128, 
   256, 512, 1024, 1280 and 1518.  Recommended sizes for other media can 
   be found in RFC 2544.  

 
 
Akhter, et al.           Expires May 30, 2007                  [Page 4] 

Internet-Draft      MPLS Benchmarking Methodology         November 2006 
    

   In addition to the individual frame size trials, an IMIX traffic 
   trial SHOULD also be included. 

   When running trials between different frame sizes, the DUT 
   configuration MUST remain the same.  

4.1.4. TTL 

   The MPLS TTL or IP TTL (depending on which portion of the packet the 
   DUT is basing the forwarding behavior) MUST be large enough to 
   traverse the DUT.  

4.1.5. Trial Duration 

   Unless otherwise specified, the test portion of each trial SHOULD be 
   no less than 30 seconds when static routing is in place and no less 
   than 200 seconds when a dynamic routing protocol and LDP (default LDP 
   hold-down timer is 180 seconds) are being used. If non-default hold-
   down and keepalive times are being used in the control plane, these 
   should be reported and the trial duration adjusted such that the test 
   portion of the trial period is longer than a full control-plane 
   holddown cycle. 

   The longer trial time for when dynamic routing protocols are being 
   used is for verifying that the DUT is able to maintain a stable 
   control-plane when the data-forwarding plane is under stress. 

    

4.1.6. Traffic Verification 

   In all cases, the sent traffic MUST be accounted for, whether it was 
   received on the wrong port, correct port or not received at all. In 
   addition, the presence of the MPLS shim, checksum, frame sequencing 
   and correct TTL MUST be verified. 

   The MPLS label presence will be determined by the test. Some tests 
   will require the label to be popped while others will require a swap. 
   In general, many test tools will by default only verify that they 
   have received the embedded instrumented signature on the receive 
   side, but will not validate MPLS stack depth. An even greater level 
   of verification would be to check if the correct label was imposed, 
   but that is considered out of scope for these tests.

Internet-Draft      MPLS Benchmarking Methodology         November 2006 
    

4.1.7. Address Resolution and Dynamic Protocol State 

   If the test or media is making use of a dynamic protocol (eg ARP, 
   OSPF, LDP), all state for the protocols should be pre-established and 
   in a stable condition before the start of the trial.

     reachable via ) Px. 

     y := number of network. (ie the first network reachable via B1 
     would be called B1RN1 and the 5th network would be called B1RN5)

6. Test Cases - MPLS Forwarding 

6.1. MPLS Forwarding and Throughput 

   This section contains the description of the tests that are related 
   to the characterization of frame forwarding of a DUT in various MPLS 
   environments.  

6.1.1. Determination of Unidirectional Static Label Imposition Rate 

   Objective 

     To obtain the maximum label imposition rate for a regular (IPv4 or 
     IPv6) packet by the DUT.  

   Test Setup 

     It is recommended that a single A and B interface SHOULD be used. 
     However, if the forwarding rate of the DUT is more than that of the 
     media rate, then additional A and B interfaces MUST be enabled so 
     as to match up the DUT's forwarding throughput. The traffic streams 
     offered MUST conform to section 16 of RFC 2544.

     For this unidirectional test, the test tool will be sending 
     unlabeled traffic to ports DAx and receiving labeled traffic on 
     ports Bx. 

     The DUT will be configured such that a single network address will 
     be reachable via each Bx port. For example, there will be the 
     connected network on the link between DB1 and B1, and a single 
     network (B1RN1) will be reachable via B1's Layer 3 address.  Test 
     tool traffic will be destined to an address in each BxRN1. 

      

     The DUT will be statically configured to impose a unique non-null 
     label for each BxRN1 

    

   Discussion 

      

   Procedure 

     Offer traffic from port Ax towards DUT at a constant load towards 
     all BxRN1 addresses for a fixed duration of time.  

     If any frame loss is detected, the offered load is decreased and 
     the sender will transmit again. An iterative search algorithm MUST 
     be used to determine the maximum offered frame rate with a zero 
     frame loss. 

     Each iteration will involve varying the offered load of the regular 
     traffic, while keeping the other parameters (test duration, number 
     of interfaces, number of addresses, frame size etc) constant, until 
     the maximum rate at which none of the offered frames are dropped is 
     determined. 

      

   Reporting Format 

     The following parameters MUST be reflected in the test report, in 
     addition to the parameters in section 4: 

      

     o Maximum throughput as defined in RFC 1242, section 3.17.

     o Values for each BxRN1 (eg 1.1.1.0/24) 

      

     Results for each test SHOULD be in the form of a table with a row 
     for each of the tested frame sizes. Additional columns SHOULD 
     include: offered load and measured throughput.  

      

    

6.1.2. Determination of Unidirectional Static Single Label Disposition 
   Rate 

    

   Objective 

     To obtain the maximum label disposition rate for a regular (IPv4) 
     packet by the DUT.  

      

   Test Setup 

     It is recommended that a single A and B interface SHOULD be used. 
     However, if the forwarding throughput of the DUT is more than that 
     of the media rate, then additional A and B interfaces MUST be 
     enabled so as to match up the DUT's forwarding rate. The traffic 
     streams offered MUST conform to section 16 of RFC 2544.  

     For this unidirectional test, the test tool will be sending labeled 
     traffic to ports DAx and receiving on ports Bx. 

     The DUT will be configured such that a single network address will 
     be reachable via each Bx port. For example, there will be the 
     connected network on the link between DB1 and B1 (B1AN), and a 
     single network (B1RN1) will be reachable via B1's Layer 3 address.   

     The DUT will be statically configured such that each BxRN1 and BxAN 
     is assigned a unique non-null label, and that label is installed in 
     the LFIB. 

     Test tool traffic will be destined to BxRN1 and BxAN in a weighted 
     round robin fashion. The labels assigned to BxRN1 and BxAN on the 
     DUT will be used. The weighting ratio between  BxRN1 and BxAN is a

     constant test parameter. A suggested ratio is 1:100 with 
     BxAN:BxRN1. 

    

   Discussion 

      

   Procedure 

     Offer traffic from port Ax towards DUT at a constant load towards 
     all BxRN1 addresses for a fixed duration of time.  

     If any frame loss is detected, the offered load is decreased and 
     the sender will transmit again. An iterative search algorithm MUST 
     be used to determine the maximum offered frame rate with a zero 
     frame loss. 

     Each iteration will involve varying the offered load of the regular 
     traffic, while keeping the other parameters (test duration, number 
     of interfaces, number of addresses, frame size, ratio of BxAN and 
     BxRN1 etc) constant, until the maximum rate at which none of the 
     offered frames are dropped is determined. 

   Reporting Format 

     The following parameters MUST be reflected in the test report, in 
     addition to the parameters in section 4: 

     o Maximum throughput as defined in RFC 1242, section 3.17. 

     o Values for each BxAN (eg 1.1.1.0/24) 

     o Ratio of BxAN:BxRN1 

      

     Results for each test SHOULD be in the form of a table with a row 
     for each of the tested frame sizes. Additional columns SHOULD 
     include: offered load and measured throughput.

   Objective 

     To obtain the maximum label swap rate for a labeled packet by the 
     DUT.  

      

   Test Setup 

     Although only a single A and B interface SHOULD be used, it is 
     possible that the forwarding capacity of the box may exceed the 
     media capacity. In such a case additional A and B interfaces MUST 
     be enabled and traffic streams offered MUST conform to section 16 
     of RFC 2544.  

     For this unidirectional test, the test tool will be sending labeled 
     traffic to ports DAx and receiving labeled traffic on ports Bx. 

     The DUT will be configured such that a single network address will 
     be reachable via each Bx port. For example, there will be the 
     connected network on the link between DB1 and B1 (B1AN), and a 
     single network (B1RN1) will be reachable via B1's Layer 3 address.   

     The DUT will be statically configured such that each BxRN1 is 
     assigned a unique non-null label, and that label is installed in 
     the LFIB. 

     The DUT will be statically configured such that each BxRN1 incoming 
     label (defined above) also has an outgoing label associated with 
     the Bx next-hop, such that a label swap will occour. 

     Test tool traffic will be destined to BxRN1. The labels assigned to 
     BxRN1 on the DUT will be used.

     Offer traffic from port Ax towards DUT at a constant load towards 
     all BxRN1 addresses for a fixed duration of time.

     be used to determine the maximum offered frame rate with a zero 
     frame loss. 

     Each iteration will involve varying the offered load of the regular 
     traffic, while keeping the other parameters (test duration, number 
     of interfaces, number of addresses, frame size, etc) constant,

     Results for each test SHOULD be in the form of a table with a row 
     for each of the tested frame sizes. Additional columns SHOULD

6.1.4. Determination of Bidirectional Static Single Label Imposition and 
   Disposition Rate 

    

   Objective 

     To obtain the maximum label imposition and disposition rate for a 
     labeled packet by the DUT.  

      

   Test Setup 

     Although only a single A and B interface SHOULD be used, it is 
     possible that the forwarding capacity of the box may exceed the 
     media capacity. In such a case additional A and B interfaces MUST 
     be enabled and traffic streams offered MUST conform to section 16 
     of RFC 2544.

     For this bidirectional test, the test tool will be 
     sending/receiving labeled traffic via ports DAx and 
     receiving/sending unlabeled traffic via ports DBx. 

      

     The DUT will be configured such that a single network address will 
     be reachable via each Bx and Ax port. For example, there will be 
     the connected network on the link between DB1 and B1 (B1AN), and a 
     single network (B1RN1) will be reachable via B1's Layer 3 address.   

      

     The DUT will be statically configured such that each AxRN1 is 
     assigned a unique non-null label, and that label is installed in 
     the LFIB as an outgoing label for AxRN1. Each BxRN1 will also be 
     assigned a label, but this label will have an outgoing behavior of 
     'pop'. 

      

     Test tool traffic will be destined to BxRN1 and AxRN1. The labels 
     assigned to BxRN1 on the DUT will be used in traffic via DAx to 
     BxRN1. Traffic destined to AxRN1 will be unlabeled and sent via 
     DBx. 

    

   Discussion 

      

   Procedure 

     Offer traffic from port Ax towards DUT at a constant load towards 
     all BxRN1 addresses for a fixed duration of time. At the same time, 
     traffic is offered from Bx towards DUT at a constant load towards 
     the AxRN1 addresses.  

      

     If any frame loss is detected, the offered load is decreased on 
     both Ax and Bx and the sender will transmit again. An iterative 
     search algorithm MUST be used to determine the maximum offered 
     frame rate with a zero frame loss.

     Each iteration will involve varying the offered load of the regular 
     traffic, while keeping the other parameters (test duration, number 
     of interfaces, number of addresses, frame size, etc) constant, 
     until the maximum rate at which none of the offered frames are 
     dropped is determined. 

      

   Reporting Format 

     The following parameters MUST be reflected in the test report, in 
     addition to the parameters in section 4: 

      

     . Maximum throughput as defined in RFC 1242, section 3.17. 
     . If the load out of Ax and Bx are not the same, the differences 
       must be noted. 
      

     Results for each test SHOULD be in the form of a table with a row 
     for each of the tested frame sizes. Additional columns SHOULD 
     include: offered load and measured throughput.

   Objective

   Test Setup 

     It is recommended that a single A and B interface SHOULD be used. 
     However, if the forwarding rate of the DUT is more than that of the 
     media rate, then additional A and B interfaces MUST be enabled so 
     as to exceed the DUT's maximum forwarding rate. The traffic streams 
     offered MUST conform to section 16 of RFC 2544.

     For this unidirectional test, the test tool will be sending 
     unlabeled traffic to ports DAx and receiving multi-labeled traffic 
     on ports Bx. 

     The DUT will be configured such that a single network address will 
     be reachable via each Bx port. For example, there will be the 
     connected network on the link between DB1 and B1, and a single 
     network (B1RN1) will be reachable via B1's Layer 3 address.  Test 
     tool traffic will be destined to an address in each BxRN1.  

      

     The DUT will be configured to enable imposing a multi-label MPLS 
     shim header consistiting of unique non-null labels for each BxRN1. 
     The multi-label may be imposed by BxRN1 being reachable via a MPLS-
     TE (Traffic Engineering) tunnel, BxRN1 being a MPLS-L3VPN address 
     or other forms. Specifically, MPLS L2VPNs MUST NOT be used to 
     create the multi-label state. 

    

   Discussion 

     MPLS-TE as as well as MPLS-VPNs would require the DUT to process 
     the IP headers of the test packet. However, in the case of MPLS-
     L2VPNs, the IP header is not processed at all and therefore the DUT 
     has fewer and simpler operations to perform.  

     In addition, the number of 'IGP LSPs' (number of outer label LSP 
     tunnels used to deliver the inner label packets to the destination 
     ports), MUST be a minimum of 1 per DBx. 

    

   Procedure 

    

     Offer traffic from port Ax towards DUT at a constant load towards 
     all BxRN1 addresses for a fixed duration of time.

     Each iteration will involve varying the offered load of the regular 
     traffic, while keeping the other parameters (test duration, number 
     of interfaces, number of addresses, frame size, ratio of BxAN and 
     BxRN1 etc) constant, until the maximum rate at which none of the 
     offered frames are dropped is determined. 

   Reporting Format 

     The following parameters MUST be reflected in the test report, in 
     addition to the parameters in section 4: 

     o Maximum throughput as defined in RFC 1242, section 3.17. 

     o Values for each BxAN (eg 1.1.1.0/24) 

      

     Results for each test SHOULD be in the form of a table with a row 
     for each of the tested frame sizes. Additional columns SHOULD 
     include: offered load and measured throughput.  

    

6.1.12. Determination of Unidirectional Static Single label Swap Rate 
   for Aggregate Label 

   Objective 

     To obtain the maximum label swap rate for a labeled packet by the 
     DUT, where the ingress label is an aggregate label.

     Although only a single A and B interface SHOULD be used, it is 
     possible that the forwarding capacity of the box may exceed the 
     media capacity. In such a case additional A and B interfaces MUST 
     be enabled and traffic streams offered MUST conform to section 16 
     of RFC 2544.  

     For this unidirectional test, the test tool will be sending labeled 
     traffic to ports DAx and receiving labeled traffic on ports Bx. 

     The DUT will be configured such that a single network address will 
     be reachable via each Bx port. For example, there will be the 
     connected network on the link between DB1 and B1 (B1AN), and a 
     single network (B1RN1) will be reachable via B1's Layer 3 address.   

     The DUT will be configured such that each BxRN1 is assigned a 
     unique non-null aggregate label, and that label is installed in the 
     LFIB. 

     The DUT will be statically configured such that each BxRN1 incoming 
     label (defined above) also has an outgoing label associated with 
     the Bx next-hop, such that a label swap will occur. 

     Test tool traffic will be destined to BxRN1. The aggregate labels 
     mapping to BxRN1 on the DUT will be used. 

    

   Discussion 

      

   Procedure 

     Offer traffic from port Ax towards DUT at a constant load towards 
     all BxRN1 addresses for a fixed duration of time.  

     If any frame loss is detected, the offered load is decreased and 
     the sender will transmit again. An iterative search algorithm MUST 
     be used to determine the maximum offered frame rate with a zero 
     frame loss. 

     Each iteration will involve varying the offered load of the regular 
     traffic, while keeping the other parameters (test duration, number 
     of interfaces, number of addresses, frame size, etc) constant, 
     until the maximum rate at which none of the offered frames are 
     dropped is determined.

   Reporting Format 

     The following parameters MUST be reflected in the test report, in 
     addition to the parameters in section 4: 

     o Maximum throughput as defined in RFC 1242, section 3.17. 

      

     Results for each test SHOULD be in the form of a table with a row 
     for each of the tested frame sizes. Additional columns SHOULD 
     include: offered load and measured throughput.  

    

6.1.13. Determination of Unidirectional IPv4 packet Fragmentation Rate 
   with Imposition 

    

   Objective 

     To obtain the maximum label imposition rate for a packet by the 
     DUT, where label imposition results in IP fragmentation.  

      

   Test Setup 

     Although only a single A and B interface SHOULD be used, it is 
     possible that the forwarding capacity of the box may exceed the 
     media capacity. In such a case additional A and B interfaces MUST 
     be enabled and traffic streams offered MUST conform to section 16 
     of RFC 2544.  

     The MTU on ports DBx should be reduced such that single label 
     imposition results in IP fragmentation. 

     For this unidirectional test, the test tool will be sending 
     unlabeled traffic to ports DAx and receiving fragmented labeled 
     traffic on ports Bx. 

     The DUT will be configured such that a single network address will 
     be reachable via each Bx port. For example, there will be the

     connected network on the link between DB1 and B1 (B1AN), and a 
     single network (B1RN1) will be reachable via B1's Layer 3 address.   

     The DUT will be statically configured to impose a unique non-null 
     label for each BxRN1 

    

   Discussion 

     Given that test tools may not be able to completely validate the 
     fragmentation, as the instrumented signature would only be present 
     in one of the fragments, or spread out amongst multiple fragments, 
     it is acceptable to use packet counts to validate the received 
     packets. 

   Procedure 

     Offer traffic from port Ax towards DUT at a constant load towards 
     all BxRN1 addresses for a fixed duration of time.  

     If any frame loss is detected, the offered load is decreased and 
     the sender will transmit again. An iterative search algorithm MUST 
     be used to determine the maximum offered frame rate with a zero 
     frame loss.

     dropped is determined.

     addition to the parameters in section 4:

     o Changed MTU value 

     o Size and number of fragments from each test packet

6.1.14. Stability Verification under Unidirectional MPLS Imposition with 
   IPv6 Extension Header 

   Objective 

     Verify that control plane remains stable while processing IPv6 
     packet with hop-by-hop extension header.  

   Test Setup 

     For this unidirectional test, the test tool will be sending 
     unlabeled IPv6 traffic to ports DAx and receiving labeled traffic 
     on ports Bx. The unlabeled traffic will include a hop-by-hop Router 
     Alert (RFC2711) extension header that will need to be processed by 
     the local software module.  

     The configuration of policing technology such that LER resources 
     are not overwhelmed as long as this policy is also present for all 
     other tests is allowed and recommended. 

     Other factors in this setup can be the same as in the previous 
     testcase with unidirectional MPLS imposition. 

   Discussion 

     The IPv6 hop-by-hop router alert extension header requires the 
     software module of the LER to follow special processing of the 
     packet. As the router alert is not considered regular traffic, the 
     purpose of this test is not to benchmark the maximum forwarding 
     rate, but to ensure that the router can maintain self stability as 
     well as a stable control plane while dealing with router alert 
     traffic. 

   Procedure 

     Offer traffic from port Ax towards DUT at a constant load towards 
     all BxRN1 addresses for a fixed duration of time.  

     Relevant LER resources (CPU, memory, etc) should be monitored for 
     reporting. Control plane (IGP, LDP, etc) MUST be monitored such

     that control session does not drop and relevant hello packets are 
     within receive and transmit windows. 

     If any frame loss is detected, the loss rate should be recorded. 

   Reporting Format 

     The following parameters MUST be reflected in the test report, in 
     addition to the parameters in section 4: 

     o Changed packet rate such at 1%, 10% and 50% of interface 
      bandwidth is consumed. 

     Results for each test SHOULD be in the form of a table with a row 
     for each of the tested frame sizes. Additional columns SHOULD 
     include: offered load and measured throughput.  

6.1.15. Stability Verification for Unidirectional MPLS Imposition with 
   IPv4 Router Options 

   The test is exactly the same as the 'Stability Verification under 
   Unidirectional MPLS Imposition with IPv6 Extension Header' test 
   except IPv4 traffic with the router-alert option is to be used. 

6.1.16. Stability Verification under Unidirectional MPLS Forwarding with 
   Router Alert Label 

   Objective 

     Verify that control plane remains stable while processing MPLS 
     frame with Router Alert label.  

   Test Setup 

      

     For this unidirectional test, the test tool will be sending labeled 
     traffic to ports DAx and receiving labeled traffic on ports Bx. The 
     traffic will include a Router Alert label as well an additional 
     label that will determine forwarding.  

     The configuration of policing technology such that LER resources 
     are not overwhelmed as long as this policy is also present for all 
     other tests is allowed and recommended. 

     As the control plane stability is being tested, a dynamic label 
     distribution protocol must be used on both port A and B.

     Other factors in this setup can be the same as in the previous 
     testcase with unidirectional MPLS label swapping. 

   Discussion 

     The MPLS Router Alert label requires the software module of the LSR 
     to follow special processing of the packet. As the router alert is 
     not considered regular traffic, the purpose of this test is not to 
     benchmark the maximum forwarding rate, but to ensure that the 
     router can maintain self stability as well as a stable control 
     plane while dealing with router alert traffic. 

   Procedure 

     Offer traffic from port Ax towards DUT at a constant load towards 
     all BxRN1 addresses for a fixed duration of time.  

     Relevant LER resources (CPU, memory, etc) should be monitored for 
     reporting. Control plane (IGP, LDP, etc) MUST be monitored such 
     that control session does not drop and relevant hello packets are 
     within receive and transmit windows.

      bandwidth is consumed.

     Offer traffic from port Ax towards DUT at a constant load towards 
     all BxRN1 addresses for a fixed duration of time.  

     If any frame loss is detected, the offered load is decreased and 
     the sender will transmit again. An iterative search algorithm MUST

     frame loss.

     Each iteration will involve varying the offered load of the regular 
     traffic, while keeping the other parameters (test duration, number 
     of interfaces, number of addresses, frame size, etc) constant. 

7. Security Considerations 

   During the course of test, the test topology must be disconnected 
   from devices that may forward the test traffic into a production 
   environment. 

   There are no specific security considerations within the scope of 
   this document. 

8. IANA Considerations 

   There are no considerations for IANA at this time.
