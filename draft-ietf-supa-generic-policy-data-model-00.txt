              draft-ietf-supa-generic-policy-data-model-00


Abstract 

   This document defines two YANG policy data models. The first is a
   generic policy model that is meant to be extended on an application-
   specific basis. The second is an exemplary extension of the first
   generic policy model, and defines rules as event-condition-action
   policies. Both models are independent of the level of abstraction of
   the content and meaning of a policy.

1. Overview

   This document defines two YANG [RFC6020] [RFC6991] policy data
   models. The first is a generic policy model that is meant to be
   extended on an application-specific basis. It is derived from the
   Generic Policy Information Model (GPIM) defined in [1]. The second
   is an exemplary extension of the first (generic policy) model, and
   defines policy rules as event-condition-action tuples. Both models
   are independent of the level of abstraction of the content and
   meaning of a policy.

   The GPIM defines a common framework as a set of model elements
   (e.g., classes, attributes, and relationships) that specify a
   common set of policy management concepts that are independent of the
   type of policy (e.g., imperative, procedural, declarative, or
   otherwise). The first YANG data model is a translation of the GPIM
   to a YANG module. The Eca Policy Rule Information Model (EPRIM),
   also defined in [1], extends the GPIM to represent policy rules that
   use the Event-Condition-Action (ECA) paradigm. The second YANG data
   model maps the EPRIM to YANG. The second YANG data model MAY be
   used to augment the functionality of the first YANG data model.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. In 
   this document, these words will appear with that interpretation   
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to 
   be interpreted as carrying [RFC2119] significance.

   This section defines acronyms, terms, and symbology used in the 
   rest of this document.

3.1.  Acronyms

3.2.  Definitions

   Action:  a set of purposeful activities that have a set of
      associated behavior.

   Boolean Clause:  a logical statement that evaluates to either TRUE
      or FALSE.  Also called Boolean Expression.

   Condition:  a set of attributes, features, and/or values that are to
      be compared with a set of known attributes, features, and/or
      values in order to make a decision.  A Condition, when used in
      the context of a Policy Rule, is used to determine whether or not
      the set of Actions in that Policy Rul can be executed or not.

   Constraint:    A constraint is a limitation or restriction.
      Constraints may be added to any type of object (e.g., events,
      conditions, and actions in Policy Rules).

   Constraint Programming:  a type of programming that uses constraints
      to define relations between variables in order to find
      a feasible (and not necessarily optimal) solution.

   Data Model:  a data model is a representation of concepts of
      interest to an environment in a form that is dependent on data
      repository, data definition language, query language,
      implementation language, and protocol (typically one or more of
      these).

   ECA:    Event - Condition - Action policy.

Internet-Draft      SUPA Generic Policy YANG Data Model       July 2016


   Event:  an Event is defined as any important occurrence in time of
      a change in the system being managed, and/or in the environment
      of the system being managed. An Event, when used in the context
      of a Policy Rule, is used to determine whether the condition
      clause of an imperative Policy Rule can be evaluated or not.

   Information Model:  an information model is a representation of
      concepts of interest to an environment in a form that is
      independent of data repository, data definition language, query
      language, implementation language, and protocol.

   Metadata:  is data that provides descriptive and/or prescriptive
   information about the object(s) to which it is attached.

   Policy Rule:    A Policy Rule is a set of rules that are used to
      manage and control the changing or maintaining of the state of one
      or more managed objects.


3.3.  Symbology

   The following representation is used to describe YANG data modules
   defined in this draft.

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      data (read-write), and "ro" means state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!"
      means a presence container, and "*" denotes a list and leaf-list.

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.


4.  Design of the SUPA Policy Data Models

   This will be completed in the next version of this draft. Three
   important points are:
   
   - different policy models have common semantics
   - capture those semantics within a common framework (GPIM)
   - extend these semantics with a specific ECA example (EPRIM)

5.  SUPA Policy Data Model YANG Module

   The SUPA YANG data model module is divided into two main parts:

      1) a set of containers that represent the objects that make
         updated a Policy Rule and its Policy Rule Components
      2) a set of containers that represent the objects that define and
         apply metadata to Policy Rules and/or Policy Rule Components
