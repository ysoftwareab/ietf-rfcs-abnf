                    draft-anderson-v6ops-siit-dc-00

Abstract

   This document describes SIIT-DC, an extension to Stateless IP/ICMP
   Translation (SIIT) [RFC6145] that makes it ideally suited for use in
   IPv6 data centre environments.  SIIT-DC simultaneously facilitates
   IPv6 deployment and IPv4 address conservation.  The overall SIIT-DC
   architecture is described, as well as guidelines for operators.
   Finally, the normative implementation requirements are described, as
   a list of additions and changes to SIIT [RFC6145].

1.  Introduction

   SIIT-DC is an extension of SIIT [RFC6145], and provides a a network-
   centric stateless translation service that allows a data centre
   operator or Internet Content Provider (ICP) to run a data centre
   network, servers, and applications using exclusively IPv6, while at
   the same time ensuring that end users that have only IPv4
   connectivity will be able to continue to access the services and
   applications.

1.1.  Motivation and Goals

   Historically, dual stack [RFC4213] has been the recommended way to
   transition from an IPv4-only environment to one capable of serving
   IPv6 users.  For data centre and Internet content providers, dual
   stack operation has a number of disadvantages compared to single
   stack operation.  In particular, the increased complexity and
   operational overhead, and very low expected return of investment in
   the short to medium term, as there are practically no end-users who
   have only connectivity to the IPv6 Internet.  Furthermore, the dual
   stack approach does not in any way help with the depletion of the
   IPv4 address space.

   Therefore, a better approach is needed.  The design goals are:

   o  Promote the deployment of native IPv6 services (cf. [RFC6540]).

   o  Provide IPv4 service availability for legacy users with no loss of
      performance or functionality.

   o  To ensure that that the legacy users' IPv4 addresses remain
      available to the servers and applications.

   o  To conserve and maximise the utilisation of IPv4 addresses.

   o  To avoid introducing more complexity than absolutely necessary,
      especially on the servers and applications.

   o  To be easy to scale and deploy in a fault-tolerant manner.

   The following subsections elaborates on how SIIT-DC meets these
   goals.

1.1.1.  Single Stack IPv6 Operation




Anderson                 Expires March 19, 2015                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                   SIIT-DC                  September 2014


   SIIT-DC allows an operator to build their applications on an
   IPv6-only foundation.  IPv4 end-user connectivity becomes a service
   provided by the network, which systems administration and application
   development staff do not need to concern themselves with.

   Obviously, this will promote universal IPv6 deployment for all of the
   provider's services and applications.

   It is worth noting that SIIT-DC requires no special support or change
   from the underlying IPv6 infrastructure, it will work with any kind
   of IPv6 network.  Traffic between IPv6-enabled end users and
   IPv6-enabled services will always be native, and SIIT-DC will not be
   involved in it at all.

1.1.2.  Stateless Operation

   Unlike other solutions that provide either dual stack availability to
   single-stack services (e.g., Stateful NAT64 [RFC6146] and Layer-4/7
   proxies), or that provide conservation of IPv4 addresses (e.g.,
   NAPT44 [RFC3022]), a SIIT-DC Gateway does not keep any state between
   each packet in a single connection or flow.  In this sense it
   operates exactly like a normal IP router, and has similar scaling
   properties - the limiting factors are packets per second and
   bandwidth.  The number of concurrent flows and flow initiation rates
   are irrelevant for performance.

   This not only allows individual SIIT-DC Gateways to easily attain
   "line rate" performance, it also allows for per-packet load balancing
   between multiple SIIT-DC Gateways using Equal-Cost Multipath Routing
   [RFC2991].  Asymmetric routing is also acceptable, which makes it
   easy to avoid sub-optimal traffic patterns; the prefixes involved may
   be anycasted from all the SIIT-DC Gateways in the provider's network,
   thus ensuring that the most optimal path through the network is used,
   even where the optimal path in one direction differs from the optimal
   path in the opposite direction.

   Finally, stateless operation means that high availability is easily
   achieved.  If an SIIT-DC Gateway should fail, its traffic can be re-
   routed onto another SIIT-DC Gateway using a standard IP routing
   protocol.  This does not impact existing flows any more than what any
   other IP re-routing event would.

1.1.3.  No Loss of End User's Source Address

Internet-Draft                   SIIT-DC                  September 2014


   SIIT-DC will map the entire end-user's source address into an
   predefined IPv6 translation prefix.  This allows the application
   server to identify the user by an IPv4 address, which is useful for
   performing tasks like Geo-Location, logging, abuse handling, and so
   forth.

1.1.4.  No Forklift Upgrades Required

   Except for the introduction of the SIIT-DC Gateways themselves, there
   is no change required in the network, servers, applications, or
   anywhere else to specifically support SIIT-DC, compared to a dual
   stack deployment.  From the clients', the servers', the IPv6 data
   centre network's, and the IPv4 Internet's point of view, SIIT-DC is
   practically invisible.  It will work with any standards-compliant
   IPv4 or IPv6 stack.

1.1.5.  No Architectural Dependency on IPv4

   SIIT-DC will allow an ICP or data centre operator to build
   infrastructure and applications entirely on IPv6.  This means that
   when the day comes to discontinue support for IPv4, no change needs
   to be made to the overall architecture - it's only a matter of
   shutting off the SIIT-DC Gateways.  Therefore, by deploying native
   IPv6 along with SIIT-DC, operators will avoid future migration or
   deployment projects relating to IPv6 roll-out and/or IPv4 sun-
   setting.

2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   IPv4 Service Address  A public IPv4 address with which IPv4-only
      clients will communicate.  This communication will be translated
      to IPv6 by the SIIT-DC Gateway.

   IPv4 Service Address Pool  One or more IPv4 prefixes routed to the
      SIIT-DC Gateway's IPv4 interface.  IPv4 Service Addresses are
      allocated from this pool.  Note that this does not necessarily
      have to be a "pool" per se, as it could also be one or more host
      routes (whose prefix length is equal to /32).  The primary purpose
      of using a pool rather than host routes is to facilitate IPv4
      route aggregation and ease provisioning of new IPv4 Service
      Addresses.

   IPv6 Service Address  A public IPv6 address assigned to a server or
      application in the IPv6 network.  IPv6-only and dual stacked
      clients communicates with this address directly without invoking
      SIIT-DC.  IPv4-only clients also communicates with this address
      through the SIIT-DC Gateway and via an IPv4 Service Address.

   SIIT-DC Host Agent  A logical function very similar to an SIIT-DC
      Gateway that resides on a server and provides virtual IPv4
      connectivity to applications, by reversing the translations done
      by the SIIT-DC Gateway.  It is an optional component of the SIIT-
      DC architecture, that may be used to increase application support.
      See [I-D.anderson-v6ops-siit-dc-2xlat].

   SIIT-DC Gateway  A device or a logical function that translates
      between IPv4 and IPv6 in accordance with Section 5.

   Static Address Mapping  A bi-directional mapping between an IPv4
      Service Address and an IPv6 Service Address configured in the
      SIIT-DC Gateway.  When translating between IPv4 and IPv6, the
      SIIT-DC Gateway changes the address fields in the translated
      packet's IP header according to any matching Static Address
      Mapping.

   Translation Prefix  An IPv6 prefix into which the entire IPv4 address
      space is mapped.  This prefix is routed to the SIIT-DC Gateway's
      IPv6 interface.  It is either an Network-Specific Prefix or a
      Well-Known Prefix as specified in [RFC6052].  When translating
      between IPv4 and IPv6, the SIIT-DC Gateway prepends or strips the
      Translation Prefix from the address fields in the translated
      packet's IP header, unless a Static Address Mapping exists for the
      IP address in question.

   In this example, 192.0.2.0/24 is allocated as an IPv4 Service Address
   Pool.  Individual IPv4 Service Addresses are assigned from this pool.
   The provider must route this prefix to the SIIT-DC Gateway's IPv4
   interface.  Note that there are no restrictions on how many IPv4

   Service Address Pools are used or their prefix length, as long as
   they are all routed to the SIIT-DC Gateway's IPv4 interface.

   The Static Address Mapping list is used when translating an IPv4
   Service Address (here 192.0.2.1) to its corresponding IPv6 Service
   Address (here 2001:db8:12:34::1) and vice versa.  When the SIIT-DC
   Gateway translates an IPv4 packet to IPv6, any IPv4 Service Address
   found in the original IPv4 header will be replaced with the
   corresponding IPv6 Service Address in the resulting IPv6 header, and
   vice versa when translating an IPv6 packet to IPv4.

   2001:db8:46::/96 is the Translation Prefix into which the entire IPv4
   address space is mapped.  It is used for translation of the end
   user's IPv4 address to IPv6 and vice versa according to the algorithm
   defined in Section 2.2 of RFC6052 [RFC6052].  This algorithmic
   mapping has a lower precedence than the configured Static Address
   Mappings.

   The SIIT-DC Gateway itself can be either a separate device or a
   logical function in another multi-purpose device, for example an IP
   router.  Any number of SIIT-DC Gateways may exist simultaneously in
   an operators infrastructure, as long as they all have the same
   translation prefix and list of Static Mappings configured.

3.1.  DNS Configuration

   The IPv6 Service Address of should be registered in DNS using an AAAA
   record, while its corresponding IPv4 Service Address should be
   registered using an A record.  This results in the following DNS
   records:

              DNS Configuration for a SIIT-DC enabled service

               app.domain.tld.    IN AAAA  2001:db8:12:34::1
               app.domain.tld.    IN A     192.0.2.1

                                 Figure 2

3.2.  Packet Flow

   In this example, "IPv4-only user" initiates a request to the
   application running on the IPv6-only server.  He starts by looking up
   the IN A record of "app.domain.tld" in DNS, and attempts to connect
   to this address on the service by transmitting the following IPv4
   packet destined for the IPv4 Service Address:

   The destination address field was translated to the IPv6 Service
   Address according to the configured Static Address Mapping, while the
   source address was field translated according to the [RFC6052]
   mapping using the Translation Prefix (because it did not match any
   Static Address Mapping).  The rest of the IP header was translated
   according to [RFC6145].  The Layer 4 payload is copied verbatim, with
   the exception of the TCP checksum being recalculated.

   Note that the IPv6 address 2001:db8:46::203.0.113.50 may also be

   The response packet is routed to the (nearest) SIIT-DC Gateway's IPv6
   interface, which will translate it back to IPv4 as follows:

            +------------------------------------------------+

                                 Figure 6

   This time, the source address matched the Static Address Mapping and
   was translated accordingly, while the destination address did not,
   and was therefore translated according to [RFC6052] by having the
   Translation Prefix stripped.  The rest of the packet was translated
   according to [RFC6145].

   The resulting IPv4 packet is transmitted back to the end user over
   the IPv4 Internet.  Subsequent packets in the flow will follow the
   exact same translation pattern.  They may or may not cross the same
   translators as earlier packets in the same flow.

   The end user's IPv4 stack has no idea that it is communicating with
   an IPv6 server, nor does the server's IPv6 stack have any idea that
   is is communicating with an IPv4 client.  To them, it's just plain
   IPv4 or IPv6, respectively.  However, the applications running on the
   server may optionally be updated to recognise and strip the
   Translation Prefix, so that the end user's IPv4 address may be used
   for logging, Geo-Location, abuse handling, and so forth.

4.  Deployment Guidelines

Internet-Draft                   SIIT-DC                  September 2014


   In this section, we list recommendations and guidelines for operators
   who would like to deploy a SIIT-DC service in their data centre
   network.

4.1.  Application Support for NAT

   Not all application protocols are able to operate in a network
   environment where rewriting of IP addresses occur.  An operator
   should therefore carefully evaluate the applications he would like to
   make available for IPv4 users through SIIT-DC, to ensure they do not
   fall in this category.  In general, if an application layer protocol
   works correctly through standard NAT44 (see [RFC3235]), it will most
   likely work correctly through SIIT-DC as well.

   Higher-level protocols that embed IP addresses as part of their
   payload are especially problematic, as noted in [RFC2663], [RFC2993],
   and [RFC3022].  Such protocols will most likely not work through any
   form of address translation, including SIIT-DC.  One well-known
   example of such a protocol is FTP [RFC0959].

   The SIIT-DC architecture may be extended with a Host Agent that
   reverses the translation performed by the SIIT-DC Gateway before
   passing the packets to the application software.  This allows the
   problematic application protocols described above to work correctly
   in an SIIT-DC environment as well.  See
   [I-D.anderson-v6ops-siit-dc-2xlat] for a description of this
   extension.

4.2.  Application Support for IPv6

   SIIT-DC requires that the application software supports IPv6
   networking, and that it has no dependency on IPv4 networking.  If
   this is not the case, the approach described in
   [I-D.anderson-v6ops-siit-dc-2xlat] may be used, as it provides the
   application with seemingly native IPv4 connectivity.  This allows
   IPv4-only applications to work correctly in an otherwise IPv6-only
   environment.

4.3.  Application Communication Pattern

   SIIT-DC is ideally suited for applications where IPv4-only nodes on
   the Internet initiate traffic towards the IPv6-only services, which
   in turn are only passively listening for inbound traffic and
   responding as necessary.  One well-known example of such a protocol
   is HTTP [RFC2616].  This is due to the fact that in this case, an
   IPv4 user looks exactly like an ordinary IPv6 user from the host and
   application's point of view, and requires no special treatment.




Anderson                 Expires March 19, 2015                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                   SIIT-DC                  September 2014


   It is possible to combine SIIT-DC with DNS64 [RFC6147] in order to
   allow an IPv6-only application to initiate communication with
   IPv4-only nodes through an SIIT-DC Gateway.  However, in this case,
   care must be taken so that all outgoing communication is sourced from
   the IPv6 Service Address that has a Static Mapping configured on the
   SIIT-DC Gateway.  If another unmapped address is used, the SIIT-DC
   Gateway will discard the packet.

   An alternative approach to the above would be to make use of an SIIT-
   DC Host Agent as described in [I-D.anderson-v6ops-siit-dc-2xlat].
   This provides the application with seemingly native IPv4
   connectivity, which it may use for both inbound and outbound
   communication without requiring the application to select a specific
   source address for its outbound communications.

4.4.  Choice of Translation Prefix

   Either a Network-Specific Prefix (NSP) from the provider's own IPv6
   address space or the IANA-allocated Well-Known Prefix 64:ff9b::/96
   (WKP) may be used.  From a technical point of view, both should work
   equally well, however as only a single WKP exists, if a provider
   would like to deploy more than one instance of SIIT-DC in his
   network, or Stateful NAT64 [RFC6146], an NSP must be used anyway for
   all but one of those deployments.

   Furthermore, the WKP cannot be used in inter-domain routing.  By
   using an NSP, a provider will have the possibility to provide SIIT-DC
   service to other operators across Autonomous System borders.

   For these reasons, this document recommends that an NSP is used.
   Section 3.3 of [RFC6052] discusses the choice of translation prefix
   in more detail.

   The Translation Prefix may use any of the lengths described in
   Section 2.2 of RFC6052 [RFC6052], but /96 has two distinct advantages
   over the others.  First, converting it to IPv4 can be done in a
   single operation by simply stripping off the first 96 bits; second,
   it allows for IPv4 addresses to be embedded directly into the text
   representation of an IPv6 address using the familiar dotted quad
   notation, e.g., "2001:db8::198.51.100.10" (cf. Section 2.4 of RFC6052
   [RFC6052])), instead of being converted to hexadecimal notation.
   This makes it easier to write IPv6 ACLs and similar that match
   translated endpoints in the IPv4 Internet.  Use of a /96 prefix
   length is therefore recommended.

4.5.  Routing Considerations

Internet-Draft                   SIIT-DC                  September 2014


   The prefixes that constitute the IPv4 Service Address Pool and the
   IPv6 Translation Prefix may be routed to the SIIT-DC Gateway(s) as
   any other IPv4 or IPv6 route in the provider's network.

   If more than one SIIT-DC Gateway is being deployed, it is recommended
   that a dynamic routing protocol (such as BGP, IS-IS, or OSPF) is
   being used to advertise the routes within the provider's network.
   This will ensure that the traffic that is to be translated will reach
   the closest SIIT-DC Gateway, reducing or eliminating sub-optimal
   traffic patterns, as well as provide high availability - if one SIIT-
   DC Gateway fails, the dynamic routing protocol will automatically
   redirect the traffic to the next-best translator.

4.6.  Location of the SIIT-DC Gateways

   It is optimal to place the SIIT-DC Gateways as close as possible to
   the direct path between the servers and the end users.  If the
   closest translator is located a long way from the optimal path, all
   packets in both directions must make a detour.  This would increase
   the RTT between the server and the end user by by two times the extra
   latency incurred by the detour, as well as cause unnecessary load on
   the network links on the detour path.

   The ideal location of the SIIT-DC Gateways would be a logical
   function within the IP routers would have handled the traffic anyway
   (if the topology was dual stacked) This way, the translation service
   would not need separate networks ports to be assigned (which might
   become saturated and impact the service quality), nor would it need
   extra rack space or energy.  Some good choices of the location could
   be within a data centre's access routers, or inside the provider's
   border routers.  If every single application in the data centre or
   the provider's network eventually get single-stacked, there would no
   need to run IPv4 on the inside of the SIIT-DC Gateway - thus allowing
   the operator to reclaim IPv4 addresses from the network
   infrastructure that may instead be used for translated services.

4.7.  Migration from Dual Stack

   While this document discusses the use of IPv6-only servers and
   applications, there is no technical requirement that the servers are
   IPv4 free.  SIIT-DC works equally well for dual stacked servers,
   which makes migration easy - after setting up the translation
   function, the DNS A record for the service is updated to point to the
   IPv4 address that will be translated to IPv6, the previously used
   IPv4 service address may continue to be assigned to the server.  This
   makes roll-back to dual stack easy, as it is only a matter of
   changing the DNS record back to what it was before.

   For high-volume services migrating to SIIT-DC from dual stack, DNS
   Round Robin may be used to gradually migrate the service's IPv4
   traffic from its native IPv4 address(es) to the translated IPv4
   Service Address(s).

4.8.  Packet Size and Fragmentation Considerations

   There are two key differences between IPv4 and IPv6 relating to
   packet sizes that one should consider when deploying SIIT-DC.  They
   result in a few problematic corner cases, which can be dealt with in
   a few different ways.

   The operator may find that relying on fragmentation in the IPv6
   domain is undesired or even operationally impossible
   [I-D.taylor-v6ops-fragdrop].  For this reason, the recommendations in
   this section seeks to minimise the use of IPv6 fragmentation.

   Unless otherwise stated, this section assumes that the MTU in both
   the IPv4 and IPv6 domains is 1500 bytes.

4.8.1.  IP Header Size Difference

   The IPv6 header is up to 20 bytes larger than the IPv4 header.  This
   means that a full-size 1500 bytes large IPv4 packet cannot be
   translated to IPv6 without being fragmented, otherwise it would
   likely have resulted in a 1520 bytes large IPv6 packet.

   If the transport protocol used is TCP, this is generally not a
   problem, as the IPv6 server will advertise a TCP MSS of 1440 bytes.
   This causes the client to never send larger packets than what can be
   translated to a single full-size IPv6 packet, eliminating any need
   for fragmentation.

   For other transport protocols, full-size IPv4 packets with the DF
   flag cleared will need to be fragmented by the SIIT-DC Gateway.  The
   only way to avoid this is to increase the Path MTU between the SIIT-
   DC Gateway and the servers to 1520 bytes.  Note that the servers' MTU
   SHOULD NOT be increased accordingly, as that would cause them to
   undergo Path MTU Discovery for most native IPv6 destinations.
   However, the servers would need to be able to accept and process
   incoming packets larger than their own MTU.  If the server's IPv6
   implementation allows the MTU to be set differently for specific
   destinations, it could be increased to 1520 for destinations within
   the Translation Prefix specifically.

4.8.2.  Minimum Path MTU Difference

Internet-Draft                   SIIT-DC                  September 2014


   The minimum allowed link MTU in IPv6 is 1280 bytes.  In IPv4, the
   corresponding value is 68 bytes.  This means that an 1280 byte large
   IPv6 packet sent to an IPv4 client may need to be fragmented by a
   router in the IPv4 network, if the path to the IPv4 client involves a
   link with a MTU lower than 1260 bytes.

   By default, an SIIT-DC Gateway will set the DF flag when translating
   from IPv6 to IPv4, resulting in a situation where the IPv6 server may
   receive an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big error where the indicated MTU value
   is less than the IPv6 minimum of 1280.  In this situation, the IPv6
   server has two choices on how to proceed, according to the last
   paragraph of Section 5 of RFC2460 [RFC2460]:

   o  It may reduce its Path MTU value to the value indicated in the
      Packet Too Big. This causes no problems for the SIIT-DC function.

   o  It may reduce its Path MTU value to exactly 1280, and also include
      a Fragmentation header in each subsequent packet sent to that
      destination.  The Fragmentation header signals to the the SIIT-DC
      Gateway that the DF flag should be cleared in the resulting IPv4
      packet, and it also provides the Identification value.

   If the use of the IPv6 Fragmentation header is problematic, and the
   operator has IPv6 servers that implement the second option above, the
   operator should enable a feature on the SIIT-DC Gateways which
   ensures that the resulting MTU field is always set to 1280 or higher
   when translating ICMPv4 Need to Fragment into ICMPv6 Packet Too Big,
   and that when translating IPv6 packets smaller or equal to 1280 bytes
   the resulting IPv4 packets will have the DF flag cleared and an
   Identification value generated, cf. Section 5.5.

4.8.3.  "Atomic Fragments"

   By default, an SIIT-DC Gateway will include a Fragmentation header in
   the resulting IPv6 packet when translating from an IPv4 packet with
   the DF flag cleared, cf. Section 4 of RFC6145 [RFC6145].

   This happens even though the resulting IPv6 packet isn't actually
   fragmented into several pieces, resulting in an "Atomic Fragment"
   [RFC6946].  This is generally not useful in a data centre
   environment, and it is therefore recommended that this behaviour is
   disabled in the SIIT-DC Gateway(s).  See Section 5.4.

5.  Implementation Requirements

   This normative section specifies the SIIT-DC protocol that is
   implemented by an SIIT Gateway.  Because SIIT-DC builds on and
   closely resembles SIIT [RFC6145], this section should be read as a
   set of additions and changes that are applied to an implementation
   already compliant to SIIT [RFC6145].  Each of the following
   subsections discuss how the requirement relates to with any
   corresponding requirements in SIIT [RFC6145].

5.1.  Compliance with RFC6145 and RFC6052

   Unless otherwise stated in the following sections, an SIIT-DC
   implementation MUST comply fully with [RFC6145].  It must also
   implement the algorithmic address mapping defined in [RFC6052].

5.2.  Static Address Mapping Function

   The implementation MUST allow the operator to configure an arbitrary
   number of Static Address Mappings which override the default
   [RFC6052] algorithm.  It SHOULD be possible to specify a single bi-
   directional mapping that will be used in both the IPv4=>IPv6 and
   IPv6=>IPv4 directions, but it MAY additionally (or alternatively)
   support unidirectional mappings.

   An example of such a bidirectional Static Address Mapping would be:

   o  192.0.2.1 <=> 2001:db8:12:34::1

   To accomplish the same using unidirectional mappings, the following
   two mappings must instead be configured:

   o  192.0.2.1 => 2001:db8:12:34::1

   o  2001:db8:12:34::1 => 192.0.2.1

   In both cases, if the SIIT-DC Gateway receives an IPv6 packet that
   has the value 2001:db8:12:34::1 in either the source or destination
   field of the IPv6 header, it MUST rewrite this field to 192 0.2.1
   when translating to IPv4.  Similarly, if the SIIT-DC Gateway receives
   an IPv4 packet that has the value 192.0.2.1 as the either the source
   or destination field of the IPv4 header, it MUST rewrite this field
   to 2001:db8:12:34::1 when translating to IPv6.  For all IPv4 or IPv6
   source or destination field values for which there are no Static
   Address Mapping, [RFC6052] compliant mapping MUST be used instead.

   Relation to [RFC6145]: The Static Address Mapping is a novel feature
   feature that is not discussed in [RFC6145].  It conflicts with

Internet-Draft                   SIIT-DC                  September 2014


   [RFC6145]'s requirement that all addresses must be translated
   according to the [RFC6052] algorithm.

5.3.  Support for Increasing the IPv6 Path MTU

   The SIIT-DC Gateway MUST provide a configuration function for the
   network administrator to adjust the threshold of the minimum IPv6 MTU
   to a value that reflects the real value of the minimum IPv6 MTU in
   the network (greater than 1280 bytes).  This will help reduce the
   chance of including the Fragment Header in the packets.

   Relation to [RFC6145]: This strengthens the corresponding "MAY"
   requirement located in Section 4 of RFC6145 [RFC6145] to a "MUST".

5.4.  Support for Disabling "Atomic Fragments"

   When the IPv4 sender does not set the DF bit, the SIIT-DC Gateway
   SHOULD NOT include an IPv6 Fragment Header in resulting non-
   fragmented IPv6 packets.  If does, the SIIT-DC Gateway MUST provide a
   configuration function that allows the SIIT-DC Gateway not to include
   the Fragment Header for the non-fragmented IPv6 packets.

   Relation to [RFC6145]: This is an update of the corresponding
   requirement in Section 4 of RFC6145 [RFC6145].  It inverts the
   recommended default behaviour to not generate IPv6 Atomic Fragments,
   and strengthens the "MAY" requirement for making it possible to
   disable this behaviour to a "MUST".

   For the definition of an "Atomic Fragment", see [RFC6946].

5.5.  Feature for Handling IPv4 Path MTUs Lower than 1260

   In order to prevent unnecessary fragments, the implementation SHOULD
   support a feature which, if enabled by the operator, changes the
   SIIT-DC Gateway's default behaviour accordingly:

   o  When translating an ICMPv4 Need To Fragment packet indicating a
      Path MTU smaller than or equal to 1260, the MTU field in the
      resulting ICMPv6 Packet Too Big is set to 1280.

   o  When translating an IPv6 packet that is smaller or equal to 1280
      bytes, the DF flag in the resulting IPv4 packet is cleared, and an
      IPv4 Identification value is generated.  The SIIT-DC Gateway MUST
      NOT create or maintain any state as a result of this.

   Relation to [RFC6145]: This is a modified version of the second
   approach described in Section 6 of RFC6145 [RFC6145].  The
   modifications are:

   1.  In the IPv4-to-IPv6 direction, the algorithm only used for ICMPv4
       Need To Fragment packets that indicate an MTU value smaller or
       equal to 1260.  The corresponding value used by [RFC6145] is
       smaller than 1280.

   2.  In the IPv6-to-IPv4 direction, an SIIT Gateway MUST NOT generate
       and maintain any state due to generating IPv4 Identification
       values.  [RFC6145] RECOMMENDS that this is done.

   Also see [I-D.gont-6man-deprecate-atomfrag-generation], which seeks
   to formally update [RFC6145] with the approach described in this
   section.

5.6.  Loop Prevention Mechanism

   As noted in Section 9.2, there is a potential for packets looping
   through the SIIT-DC function if it receives an IPv4 packet for which
   there is no Static Address Mapping.  It is therefore RECOMMENDED that
   the implementation has a mechanism that automatically prevents this
   behaviour.  One way this could be accomplished would be to discard
   any IPv4 packets that would be translated into an IPv6 packet that
   would be routed straight back into the SIIT-DC function.

   If such a mechanism isn't provided, the implementation MUST provide a
   way to manually filter or null-route the destination addresses that
   would otherwise cause loops.

   Relation to [RFC6145]: This security consideration applies only when
   an SIIT-DC Gateway translates a packet in "pure" SIIT [RFC6145] mode
   (i.e., both address fields are translated according to [RFC6052]).
   This consideration is in other words not specific to SIIT-DC, it is
   inherited from [RFC6145].  In spite of this, [RFC6145] does not
   describe this consideration or any methods of prevention.  The
   requirements in this section is therefore novel to SIIT-DC, even
   though they apply equally to [RFC6145].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

8.  IANA Considerations

   This draft makes no request of the IANA.  The RFC Editor may remove
   this section prior to publication.

9.  Security Considerations

9.1.  Mistaking the Translation Prefix for a Trusted Network

   If a Network-Specific Prefix from the provider's own address space is
   chosen for the translation prefix, as is recommended, care must be
   taken if the translation service is used in front of services that
   have application-level ACLs that distinguish between the operator's
   own networks and the Internet at large, as the translated IPv4 end
   users on the Internet will appear to come from within the provider's
   own IPv6 address space.  It is therefore important that the
   translation prefix is treated the same as the Internet at large,
   rather than as a trusted network.

9.2.  Packets Looping Through the SIIT-DC Function

   If the SIIT-DC Gateway receives an IPv4 packet destined to an address
   for which there is no Static Address Mapping, its destination address
   will be rewritten according to [RFC6052], making the resulting IPv6
   packet have a destination address within the translation prefix,
   which is likely routed to back to the SIIT-DC function.  This will
   cause the packet to loop until its Time To Live / Hop Limit reaches
   zero, potentially creating a Denial Of Service vulnerability.

   To avoid this, it should be ensured that packets sent to IPv4
   destinations addresses for which there are no Static Address
   Mappings, or whose resulting IPv6 address does not have a more-
   specific route to the IPv6 network, are immediately discarded.

Appendix A.  Complete SIIT-DC topology example

   This figure shows a more complete SIIT-DC topology, in order to
   better demonstrate the beneficial properties it has.  In particular,
   it tries to highlight the following:











Anderson                 Expires March 19, 2015                [Page 21]

Internet-Draft                   SIIT-DC                  September 2014


   o  Stateless operation: Any number of SIIT-DC Gateways may be
      deployed side-by side, or indeed anywhere in the IPv6 network, as
      any standard routing mechanism may be used to direct traffic to
      them (shown here with BGP on the IPv4 side and ECMP on the IPv6
      side).  This in turn leads to high availability, should one of the
      SIIT-DC Gateways fail or become unavailable, those standard
      routing mechanisms will ensure that traffic is automatically
      redirect one of the remaining SIIT-DC Gateways.

   o  IPv4 address conservation: Even though the to customers in the
      example have several hundred servers, most of them are not used
      for externally available services, and thus do not require an IPv4
      address.  The network between the servers and the SIIT-DC Gateways
      require no IPv4 addresses, either.  Furthermore, the IPv4
      addresses that are used do not have to be assigned to customers in
      the form of aggregated blocks or prefixes; which makes it easy to
      achieve 100% effective utilisation of the IPv4 service address
      pools.

   o  Application support: The translation-friendly applications HTTP
      and SMTP will work through SIIT-DC without requiring any special
      customisation.  Furthermore, translation-unfriendly applications
      such as FTP will also work if an host agent in present, cf.
      [I-D.anderson-v6ops-siit-dc-2xlat].

   o  Native IPv6 as the foundation: Every server, application, and
      network component has access to native and untranslated IPv6
      connectivity to each other and to the Internet.  Traffic through
      the SIIT-DC Gateways will diminish over time as IPv6 is deployed
      throughout the Internet.  Eventually they may be shut down
      entirely, which causes no disruption to the application stacks'
      ability to deliver their services over native IPv6.

                                 Figure 7

Appendix B.  Comparison to Other Deployment Approaches

   There are a number of alternative deployment strategies a data centre
   operator may follow.  They each have different properties and helps
   solve a different set of challenges.  This section aims to compare
   the SIIT-DC approach with each of the most common ones, by
   highlighting the benefits and disadvantages of each.

B.1.  IPv4-only

   At the time of writing, IPv4-only operation remains the status quo
   for most operators.  As such, it is well understood and supported.
   An operator can reasonably expect everything to work correctly in an
   IPv4-only environment.

   Benefits of IPv4-only operation compared to SIIT-DC include:

   o  No translation occurs, the end-to-end principle is intact.

   o  Compatible with all common application protocols.

   o  Compatible with IPv4-only devices.

   o  Compatible with IPv4-only application software, without requiring
      a host agent.

   Disadvantages of IPv4-only operation compared to SIIT-DC include:

   o  Does not provide any form of IPv6 connectivity.

   o  Does not alleviate IPv4 address scarcity.

B.2.  IPv4-only + NAPT44

   An operator who would otherwise chose a traditional IPv4-only
   approach, but cannot due to having insufficient public IPv4 addresses
   available, could chose to deploy using a combination of private IPv4
   addresses [RFC1918] and NAPT44 [RFC3022] devices which will translate
   between a smaller number of public IPv4 addresses and the private
   addresses assigned to the servers that provide public services to the
   Internet.

   Benefits of IPv4-only + NAPT44 operation compared to SIIT-DC include:

   o  Compatible with IPv4-only devices.




Anderson                 Expires March 19, 2015                [Page 24]

Internet-Draft                   SIIT-DC                  September 2014


   o  Compatible with IPv4-only application software, without requiring
      a host agent.

   Disadvantages of IPv4-only + NAPT44 operation compared to SIIT-DC
   include:

   o  Does not provide any form of IPv6 availability.

   o  Requires network devices that track all flow state, which may
      create a performance bottleneck and be an easy target for Denial
      of Service attacks.

   o  Limits routing flexibility (prevents closest exit routing), as
      outbound traffic must pass across the same NAPT44 device that
      handled the inbound traffic.

   o  Limited potential for horizontal scaling, as packets cannot be
      load-balanced across multiple NAT devices.

   o  Depending on whether or not the NAPT44 device rewrites source
      addresses in order to attract the return traffic to itself:

   o

      *  Obscures the true source address of the user from the server/
         application, preventing it from e.g. performing geo-location
         lookups, or:

      *  Requires an IPv4 default route to be pointed to the NAPT44
         device, also attracting native traffic that does not need to
         undergo translation.

   In addition, application compatibility is a consideration with both
   NAPT44 and SIIT-DC, but the exact nature depends from application to
   application, so it is hard to objectively quantify if there is a
   clear advantage to either approach here.  Some translation-unfriendly
   application protocols may work without host modifications through the
   use of Application Layer Gateway support in the NAPT44 device (e.g.,
   FTP [RFC0959]), or in the SIIT-DC architecture when a host agent is
   being used [I-D.anderson-v6ops-siit-dc-2xlat].  Other application
   protocols might not work with NAPT44 at all, but will work in the
   SIIT-DC if a host agent is being used (e.g., FTP/TLS [RFC4217]).

   In summary, the most accurate statement would be to say that a NAPT44
   architecture is more compatible with translation-unfriendly protocols
   than plain SIIT-DC, while SIIT-DC is more compatible than NAPT44 if a
   host agent is used.

   For a more complete discussion of potential issues with running
   NAPT44, see Architectural Implications of NAT [RFC2993].

B.3.  Dual Stack

   Dual Stack [RFC4213] could be used both with or without NAPT44 to
   handle IPv4.  In general, the benefits and disadvantages are equal to
   the corresponding IPv4-only option, except for the fact that Dual
   Stack does provides IPv6 connectivity.  Therefore, his section only
   lists the benefits and disadvantages which are unique to a Dual Stack
   environment.

   Benefits of Dual Stack operation compared to SIIT-DC include:

   o  No translation occurring, the end-to-end principle is intact
      (assuming NAPT44 isn't used).

   o  Compatible with all common application protocols (assuming NAPT44
      isn't used).

   o  Compatible with IPv4-only devices.

   o  Compatible with IPv4-only application software, without requiring
      a host agent.

   Disadvantages of Dual Stack operation compared to SIIT-DC include:

   o  Does not alleviate IPv4 address scarcity (assuming NAPT44 isn't
      used).

   o  Increases the complexity of the infrastructure, as many things
      must done twice (once for IPv4 and once for IPv6).  Examples of
      things that must be duplicated in this manner under Dual Stack:
      Firewall rules/ACLs, IGP topology, monitoring, troubleshooting.

   o  Encourages software developers, systems administrators, etc. to
      build architectures that cannot operate correctly without IPv4.
      This in turn makes it difficult to make use of Dual Stack as a
      short term transitional stage, rather than a near-permanent end
      state.

   o  Increases the amount of things that can encounter failures, and
      increases the time required to locate and fix such failures.  This
      reduces reliability.
