1.  Introduction

   This specification defines mechanisms in the form of Atom Format
   [RFC4287] extensions that Atom Feed publishers can use to explicitly
   indicate that specific Atom Entries have been explicitly removed from
   a feed for any reason.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119]

   This specification uses XML Namespaces [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114]
   to uniquely identify XML element names.  It uses the following
   namespace prefix for the indicated namespace URI;

   {Ed.  Note: this namespace MUST be changed to a proper IETF namespace
   scheme prior to publication}

    "at": "http://purl.org/atompub/tombstones/1.0"


3.  The 'deleted-entry' element

   The 'deleted-entry' element MAY appear as a child of atom:feed to
   represent an Atom Entry that has been explicitly removed from the
   feed The element consists of a required 'id' attribute whose value
   specifies the universally unique atom:id value of the deleted entry
   and an optional 'when' attribute whose value is an [RFC3339] "date-
   time" specifying the instant the entry was deleted.  An uppercase "T"
   character MUST be used to separate date and time, and an uppercase
   "Z" character MUST be present in the absence of a numeric time zone
   offset

     deletedEntry = element at:deleted-entry {
       atomCommonAttributes,
       & attribute id { atomURI },
       & attribute when { atomDateConstruct }?,
       ( by?,
       & comment?,
       & undefinedContent )
     }

   The 'deleted-entry' element MAY contain at most one 'by' element that
   identifies the entity that deleted the entry.

   The 'deleted-entry' element MAY contain at most one 'comment' element
   whose content provides additional information about the deletion
   operation.

   Atom Feed Documents MAY contain any number of 'deleted-entry'
   elements.

     <feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
        ...
        <at:deleted-entry
          id="tag:example.org,2005:/entries/1"
          when="2005-11-29T12:12:12Z">
          <at:by>
            <name>John Doe</name>
            <email>jdoe@example.org</email>
          </at:by>
          <at:comment>Removed comment spam</at:comment>
        </at:deleted-entry>
        <at:deleted-entry
          id="tag:example.org,2005:/entries/2"
          when="2005-11-29T12:11:12Z">
          <at:by>
            <name>John Doe</name>
            <email>jdoe@example.org</email>
          </at:by>
          <at:comment>Removed comment spam</at:comment>
        </at:deleted-entry>
        ...
     </feed>


4.  The 'by' Element

   The 'by' element is an Atom Person Construct used to identify the
   entity that removed the entry from the feed.

     by = element at:by { atomPersonConstruct }


5.  The 'comment' Element

   The 'comment' element in an Atom Text Construct used to provide
   additional human readable information about the removal of the entry
   from the feed.

     comment = element at:comment { atomTextConstruct }

6.  Security Considerations

   As specified in [RFC4287], Atom processors should be aware of the
   potential for spoofing attacks where an attacked publishes atom:entry
   elements with the same atom:id value of entries from other Atom
   feeds.  The same potential exists with the mechanisms defined here in
   that an attacker may attempt to spoof an application into believing
   that a given entry has been removed from a feed.  To mitigate this
   issue, Atom processors are advised to ignore 'deleted-entry' elements
   referencing entries that have not previously appeared within the
   containing Feed document and should take steps to verify the origin
   of the Atom feed before considering the entries to be removed.


7.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations introduced by this specification.
