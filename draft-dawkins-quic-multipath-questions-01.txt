                  Questions for Multiple Paths In QUIC
               draft-dawkins-quic-multipath-questions-01

Abstract

   The IETF QUIC working group has been chartered to produce extensions
   that would "enable ... multipath capabilities" since the working
   group was formed in 2016, but because multipath was an extension,
   work on multipath, and the other extensions named in the charter,
   waited while work proceeded on the core QUIC protocol specifications.

   After the QUIC working group chairs requested publication for the
   core QUIC protocol specifications, they scheduled a virtual interim
   meeting to understand the use cases that various groups inside and
   outside the IETF were envisioning for multipath with QUIC.

   As part of that discussion, it became obvious that people had a
   variety of ideas about how multiple paths would be used, because they
   weren't looking at the same use cases, and so had different
   assumptions about how applications might use QUIC over multiple
   paths.

   This document is intended to capture questions that have come up in
   discussions, with some suggested answers, to inform further
   discussion in the working group.

Internet-Draft          QUIC Multipath Questions            January 2021


1.  Introduction

   The IETF QUIC working group has been chartered to produce extensions
   that would "enable ... multipath capabilities" ([QUIC-charter]) since
   the working group was formed in 2016, but because multipath was an
   extension, work on multipath, and the other extensions named in the
   charter, waited while work proceeded on the core QUIC protocol
   specifications ([I-D.ietf-quic-transport] and related
   specifications).

   After the QUIC working group chairs requested publication for the
   core QUIC protocol specifications, they scheduled a virtual interim
   meeting ([QUIC-interim-20-10]) to understand the use cases that
   various groups inside and outside the IETF were envisioning for
   multipath with QUIC.

   As part of that discussion, which continued on the QUIC working group
   mailing list and at IETF 109 [QUIC-IETF-109-minutes], it became
   obvious that people had a variety of ideas about how multiple paths
   would be used, because they weren't looking at the same use cases,
   and so had different assumptions about how QUIC applications might
   use multiple paths.

   This document is intended to capture questions that have come up in
   discussions, with some suggested answers, to inform further
   discussion in the working group.

1.1.  A 2500-year Side Trip

   The story that might have been titled "The People Unable to See and
   the Elephant" [Elephant-By-Touch] in 2021, is from the Indian
   subcontinent, and is at least 2500 years old (it is recorded in the
   Buddhist text Udana 6.4 [Udana-6-4]).  The story, which has spread
   widely throughout the world, is about people unable to see, who are
   brought before the king, and shown an elephant - but they only
   touched the part of the elephant they were each standing in front of,
   and then began to argue about what an elephant was like (in
   [Udana-6-4].  Their descriptions were that "an elephant is like" a
   jar, a basket, a plowshare, the pole of a plow, a granary, a post, a
   mortar, a pestle, or a broom.

   None were completely wrong (they had their hands on the part of the
   elephant they were right about), but none were completely right,
   either (an elephant was more than the parts they hand their hands
   on).  And the king pointed to the monks of different sects who had
   been arguing about the teachings of the Buddha, and said, "they keep
   on arguing, quarreling, and disputing, wounding one another with

   weapons of the mouth, saying, 'The teaching is like this, it's not
   like that.  The teaching is not like that, it's like this.'"

1.2.  Back to the Introduction

   Let us turn our attention from "describing an elephant", to
   "describing what multiple paths in QUIC might mean",

   o  the QUIC working group virtual interim meeting minutes on
      multipath at [QUIC-interim-20-10-minutes], which include pointers
      to the video recording from the meeting, pointers to each
      presentation given, questions and answers after each presentation,

   o  discussion that continued following the virtual interim meeting
      the QUIC working group mailing list, and

   o  discussion during the QUIC working group session at IETF 109
      [QUIC-IETF-109-minutes].

   We are not unable to see the parts of QUIC over multiple paths that
   we have touched, but we can't agree on the shape of multipath for
   QUIC without understanding what other people are touching.

1.3.  Notes for Readers

   It cannot be emphasized enough that multiple proposals for "QUIC
   multipath" have been submitted to the IETF (at a minimum,
   [I-D.deconinck-quic-multipath], [I-D.an-multipath-quic] and
   [I-D.an-multipath-quic-application-policy], [I-D.liu-multipath-quic],
   and [I-D.huitema-quic-mpath-option]).  In this document, "QUIC
   multipath" means only "QUIC using multiple paths", and draws from the
   discussion in the QUIC working group mailing list, some of which has
   been guided by one or more of the current proposals.

   This document does reuse some terminology from [I-D.dawkins-quic-
   what-to-do-with-multipath}}, especially "Traffic Switching" and
   "Traffic Splitting", which are summarized in Section 3.2.

   This document is an informational Internet-Draft, not adopted by any
   IETF working group, and does not carry any special status within the
   IETF.

   Please note well that this document reflects the author's current
   understanding of working group discussions.  It is likely that there
   are more questions than currently included in the document, and it is
   even more likely that some of the suggested answers are incomplete or
   (unlike the people in Section 1.1) completely wrong.  Contributions

2.  Metaquestions About QUIC Multipath

   We've had considerable discussion about the details of multipath
   implementation in QUIC, but it's worth starting out with a couple of
   metaquestions:

   o  Do we need multipath in QUIC? (see Section 2.1)

   o  Do we already have multipath in QUIC? (see Section 2.2)

2.1.  MQ-Need Do We Need Multipath in QUIC?

   The most compelling explanation of the point of view that we don't
   need multipath is likely the [Chromium-Multipath] presentation given
   at [QUIC-interim-20-10].  The short summary of this presentation was
   that Google had included multipath in planning for their gQUIC
   implementation, but subsequently stopped working on this, choosing
   instead to focus on making connection migration work, given that this
   was what customers were asking for.

   As of the date of [QUIC-interim-20-10], few if any implementations
   were using connection migration, which was defined in
   [I-D.ietf-quic-transport].  So there was a well-supported point of
   view that the right thing to do was to get deployment experience with
   connection migration, and then see what use cases remain that could
   not be supported using connection migration.

   Suggested answer to MQ-01: "Maybe".

Internet-Draft          QUIC Multipath Questions            January 2021


2.2.  MQ-Have Do We Already Have Multipath in QUIC?

   We noted in discussions that [I-D.ietf-quic-transport] allows an
   implementation to open two or more connections on different paths,
   verify the paths, and even probe to ensure that a path is still valid
   before migrating from one connection to another.  When an
   implementation does this proactively, there is no connection
   establishment delay when the implementation migrates from one path to
   another.  So it's a reasonable question to ask, "do we already have
   multipath support in QUIC?"

   For some applications, yes, but this is highly application-dependent.

   The key point in discussion was that this level of support allows
   rapid migration from one path to another (what
   [I-D.dawkins-quic-what-to-do-with-multipath] calls "traffic
   switching"}, but does not allow sustained simultaneous use of
   multiple paths (what [I-D.dawkins-quic-what-to-do-with-multipath]
   calls "traffic splitting").

   Even for traffic switching, the QUIC implementation does not know the
   capacity of the path that the connection migrates to, and must learn
   it, and this means that a successful connection migration can lead to
   a detectable difference in performance if the migrated-from
   connection was carrying a significant amount of traffic.

   Suggested answer to MQ-02: "For applications that perform traffic
   switching, possibly so.  For applications that perform traffic
   splitting, no".

3.  Questions about Multipath in QUIC

   Once discussion moves beyond the metaquestions in Section 2,
   questions remain.

   Please note that this document only includes high-level questions.
   There have also been discussions about topics like whether a single
   sequence number space is shared across paths, etc.  These questions
   aren't included in this document, even though they're important.

3.1.  Q-HowMany Is There One "Multipath"?

   Based on mailing list discussion, the answer is almost certainly
   "No".  "Multipath" is at best an umbrella term covering a variety of
   use cases that can make use of multiple paths in a variety of ways,
   to accomplish a variety of goals.  Some examples are listed in
   Section 3.7.




Dawkins                   Expires July 21, 2021                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft          QUIC Multipath Questions            January 2021


   If an application can use connections over multiple paths
   independently from each other, the application could possibly make
   use of multiple paths, without any "multipath" support in QUIC at
   all.  But this is highly application-dependent.

   We noted that there are many strategies for using multiple paths
   (some, but certainly not all, described in
   [I-D.dawkins-quic-what-to-do-with-multipath]).  It's worth also
   noting that these strategies may not have much in common with each
   other.  There are use cases that expect to move from path to path,
   depending on the relative financial costs of those paths.  Other use
   cases expect to move from path to path depending on the measured RTT
   of each path, picking a path with the lowest measured RTT.  Still
   others may expect to use multiple paths for a single connection, if
   the measured path characteristics are "sufficiently similar" to each
   other.

   Suggested answer to Q-HowMany: "It's not clear that one multipath
   scheduler can support all of these use cases".

3.2.  Q-Transport Do Transport Protocols Need to Support Multipath?

   This question seems to revolve around two sub-questions:

   o  Whether we can identify use cases with enough in common with each
      other to reuse a single scheduler, whether or not there are other
      use cases that need different schedulers.

   From a code reuse perspective, we note that multipath is complicated
   enough to get right that depending on applications to get multipath
   right isn't desirable, although it's unavoidable.  One reason QUIC
   was originally chartered to do multipath was because we noticed that
   both TCP [RFC0793] and SCTP [RFC4960] were retrofitted with support
   for some aspects of multipath operation ([RFC8684] added multipath
   support for TCP, and [RFC5061] added fast failover to another path
   for SCTP).

   o  Whether we think there are enough use cases that don't rely on
      application-specific awareness to make scheduling decisions.

   We have been successful when we've included Traffic Switching in
   transport protocols, but we've only been successful including Traffic
   Splitting in transport protocols when relevant path characteristics
   have been similar between various paths, and the use case involved
   traffic that didn't require the transport to distinguish between
   different types of application-level information when selecting an
   appropriate path.  If an application wants to send some types of
   video frames over one path and other types over a different path,



Dawkins                   Expires July 21, 2021                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          QUIC Multipath Questions            January 2021


   that's not going to be easy to do using a general-purpose transport
   mechanism.  And while the Internet is more than the World Wide Web,
   we noted that the World Wide Web has been moving away from bulk
   transfers for some time, so that user-perceived latency matters much
   more than bandwidth utilization.

   Suggested answer to Q-Transport: "Maybe.  But it's important to have
   realistic expectations.  We will likely end up with multiple
   schedulers, and we may very well end up with applications that can't
   use any of the schedulers we describe, and have to handle multiple
   paths on their own".

3.3.  Q-HTTP3 Does Multipath for QUIC Imply Multipath for HTTP/3-QUIC?

   [QUIC-charter] has focused on supporting HTTP since the working group
   was chartered in 2016.  Although it is certainly possible for
   applications to use [I-D.ietf-quic-transport] as their interface to
   the QUIC protocol, that's not what most applications we have
   implementation and deployment experience with have used, and the
   recent discussions in the MASQUE working group [MASQUE-charter] has
   pointed towards reusing HTTP/3, even for a tunneling and proxying
   application that may not make much use of HTTP beyond connection set-
   up.  Some use cases include tunneling, so are reasonable candidates
   to use HTTP/3 to set up MASQUE tunnels anyway.

   Suggested answer to Q-HTTP3: "Probably so, especially if the goal is
   to provide a multipath capability for QUIC without duplicating
   testing that has already been carried out at scale for HTTP/3".

3.4.  Q-Symmetric Do Applications Need Symmetric Multipath QUIC?

   The QUIC transport protocol is so closely tied to HTTP/3 that both
   [I-D.ietf-quic-transport] and [I-D.ietf-quic-http] were specified in
   the same working group ([QUIC-charter]), and one result of this close
   relationship is that QUIC is an asymmetric client-server transport
   protocol, not a symmetric "host to host" transport protocol.  Each
   connection is initiated by a client endpoint, sending to a server
   endpoint.

   This is a very reasonable architecture, for a transport protocol
   targeting use by HTTP, a client-server application protocol, and this
   fits well into the current Internet architecture, which (for better
   or worse) includes middleboxes that enforce this directionality.
   These middleboxes include firewalls that force communications to be
   initiated from "inside" a network perimeter, which works fine when
   the goal is to provide clients "inside" access to servers "outside",
   and Network Address Translators often enforce similar restrictions,
   so that a packet arriving at the NAT from an unassigned address



Dawkins                   Expires July 21, 2021                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft          QUIC Multipath Questions            January 2021


   "inside" the network will be bound to an address "outside" the
   network, but a packet arriving from an unassigned address "outside"
   the network will simply be dropped.

   If HTTP/3 is the driving use case for QUIC multipath, the client-
   server nature of the QUIC transport protocol is fine.  If the goal is
   to support other applications, especially bidirectional application
   protocols, we need to think about this in more detail.

   We noted that QUIC connection migration isn't entirely client-server
   - a server can send the client a preferred_address transport
   parameter during the initial handshake.  This capability is limited,
   in that it can only happen once, early in the life of a connection,
   and the client might not actually migrate to the preferred address.
   Even if the server does want to migrate the connection, often the
   client must be the one to initiate that communication because of the
   previously noted middlebox constraints.

   Suggested answer for Q-Symmetric: "Need a clearer understanding of
   the applications that will make use of QUIC multipath, in order to
   know this".

3.5.  Q-Reorder What are the Expectations about Reordering?

   We've had at least two starting points for people in these
   discussions - one that expects traffic to be delivered in-order to
   applications, and one that expects applications to handle their own
   out-of-order delivery, since the sending application needs to track
   what's actually being delivered, including being delivered
   significantly out of order, in order to select a path more
   effectively.

   For latency-sensitive applications, it's likely that out-of-order
   delivery across paths is something the application would want to be
   aware of.  And it's worth noting that we're chatting about the
   desirability of reliable streams, versus partially reliable streams,
   versus datagrams, in at least a couple of use cases, and partial
   reliability isn't part of streams in [I-D.ietf-quic-transport], so if
   we think partially reliable streams are the right answer, there's
   still some specification work to do.

   It's also worth mentioning that repair strategies for reordering
   across multiple paths may be closer to research than to engineering.
   Some helpful perspectives are provided in
   [I-D.amend-iccrg-multipath-reordering].

   Suggested answer for Q-Reorder: "Answer unclear".

3.6.  Q-CB How Will We Measure the Benefits and Costs of Multipath?

   This has come up most often in private conversations, but I've heard
   concerns about our ability to measure whether we are making the best
   use of multiple paths at scale, in a reproducible way.

   It seems obvious that this question is important, and while it may be
   early in the process to expect a detailed answer, this question is
   recorded in this document so that we don't lose track of it.

   Suggested answer for Q-CB: "Please check back later".

3.7.  Q-Goals What Are the Goals for using Multiple Paths?

   At least one point of view is that different use cases have different
   goals.  Some goals that were shared in the QUIC multipath virtual
   interim ((QUIC-interim-20-10}} include

   o  to migrate from one path to another, possibly because a path has
      stopped working, or because a "better" path becomes available.

   o  using all available bandwidth between two endpoints, across
      multiple paths.

   o  minimizing latency for the best possible user experience,
      especially for page loads on the Web.

   o  maximizing reliability of specific traffic, by transmitting the
      same traffic on multiple paths, either at all times or at specific
      times, such as "when radio signals are fading".

   Other goals certainly exist, including goals described in
   [I-D.an-multipath-quic-application-policy] and
   [I-D.bonaventure-iccrg-schedulers], and it's likely that even this
   set doesn't include all possible strategies.  It's also worth noting
   that few of the presentations given at [QUIC-interim-20-10] shared a
   common set of even two or three strategies.

   Note that actual use cases may be more nuanced about their goals -
   for instance, sending low-latency traffic over the lowest-latency
   path, and then using all remaining available bandwidth across all
   paths for other traffic.

   It will be very helpful if we can look for a small number of simple
   concepts that would allow a small number of schedulers to meet most
   application requirements.  The alternative - adding schedulers every
   time someone thinks of a new strategy - is too painful to
   contemplate.

Internet-Draft          QUIC Multipath Questions            January 2021


   Suggested answer for Q-Goals: "We sure hope we can narrow the set of
   goals down to something manageable".

3.8.  Q-API What are the API Considerations for Multipath?

   We've noted a number of times that the most useful features of
   protocols won't be used if there is no way for an application to use
   them.

   HTTP/2 stream priorities [RFC7540] was mentioned frequently, but
   other features were mentioned.

   We need a better understanding of the goals (see Section 3.7 to
   answer this question, but it's included in this document so we don't
   forget it.

   Suggested answer for Q-API: "Please check back later".

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not make any request to IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   QUIC-specific security considerations are discussed in Section 21 of
   [I-D.ietf-quic-transport].

   Section 6 of [I-D.ietf-quic-datagram] discusses security
   considerations specific to the use of the Unreliable Datagram
   Extension to QUIC.

   Some multipath QUIC-specific security considerations can be found in
   Section 8 of the individual draft [I-D.deconinck-quic-multipath].
   The other QUIC multipath proposals named in Section 1.3 have "to be
   determined" security considerations sections, which is not unusual
   for individual Internet-Drafts.

6.  Acknowledgements

   I'd like to thank Lars Eggert and Lucas Pardue, the QUIC working
   group chairs, who called the QUIC virtual interim meeting on
   multipath.

   I'd also like to thank the presenters at the QUIC virtual interim,
   who put together valuable presentations on short notice.

   Mikkel Fahnoee Joergensen, Lars Eggert, and Mike Bishop provided
   thoughts about symmetrical multipath QUIC that informed Section 3.4.

Internet-Draft          QUIC Multipath Questions            January 2021


   Christian Huitema made a plea for sanity about the number of goals
   for multipath QUIC, that is now included in Section 3.7.

   Many thanks to (your name could easily appear here) for reviews and
   comments.

   I've been through the QUIC working group archives on multipath
   discussions, along with the minutes from [QUIC-interim-20-10] and
   IETF 109 [QUIC-IETF-109-minutes], and too many people have commented
   in those venues for me to list them all.  My apologies for that, but
   thank you all for contributing.

   And it's worth noting that the story described in Section 1.1
   included the people who were trying to describe the elephant beating
   other people who disagreed with their description.  Thanks for not
   going there in the QUIC working group.
