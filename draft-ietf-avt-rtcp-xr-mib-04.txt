1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

2. Overview

   An "RTP System" may be a host end-system that runs an application
   program that sends or receives RTP data packets, or it may be an
   intermediate-system that forwards RTP packets.  RTP Control Protocol
   (RTCP) packets are sent by senders and receivers to convey
   information about RTP packet transmission and reception [RFC3550].
   RTCP Extended Report (XR) [RFC3611] packets are sent by receivers 
   to convey additional information about certain types of RTP packet 
   reception.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

2.1 Components

   The RTCP XR MIB is structured around "Session", "Source", 
   "Destination" and "Receiver" conceptual abstractions.

Clark             Expires August 2006                         [Page 2]

   2.1.1  An RTP Session is an association of two or more participants
   communicating with RTP.  For each participant, the session is defined
   by a particular pair of destination transport addresses (one network
   address plus a port pair for RTP and RTCP).  The destination
   transport addresses may be common for all participants, as in the
   case of IP multicast, or may be different for each, as in the case of
   individual unicast addresses plus a common port pair," as defined in
   section 3 of [RFC3550].

   2.1.2 A "Sender" is identified within an RTP session by a 32-bit
   numeric "Synchronization Source," or "SSRC", value and is "...the
   source of a stream of RTP packets" as defined in section 3 of
   [RFC3550].  The sender is also a source of RTCP Sender Report packets
   as specified in section 6 of [RFC3550].

   2.1.3 A "Receiver" of a "stream of RTP packets" can be a unicast or
   multicast Receiver as described in 2.1.1, above.  An RTP Receiver has
   an SSRC value that is unique to the session.  An RTP Receiver is a
   source of RTCP Receiver Reports as specified in section 6 of
   [RFC3550] and RTCP XR VoIP Metrics Reports as specified in section
   4.7 of [RFC3611].

2.2 Applicability of the MIB to RTP System Implementations

   The RTCP XR MIB may be used in RTP Host Systems (end systems), see
   section 3 of [RFC3550], that are supporting Voice over IP (VoIP host
   systems) or in intermediate systems.

   2.2.1 VoIP host Systems are end-systems that may use the RTCP XR MIB 
   to collect RTP Voice over IP session data that the host is sending or
   receiving; these data may be used by a network manager to detect and
   diagnose faults that occur over the lifetime of a VoIP session as in
   a "help-desk" scenario.

   2.2.2 Monitors of RTP Voice over IP sessions may be third-party or
   may be located in the RTP host.  Monitors may use the RTCP XR MIB to
   collect Voice over IP session statistical data; these data may be
   used by a network manager for planning and other network-management
   purposes.  A Monitor may use the RTCP XR MIB to collect data to 
   permit a network manager to diagnose faults in VoIP sessions.  

2.3  Relationship to the RTP MIB V2

   The RTP MIB V2 [draft-ietf-avt-mib-rtp-bis-00.txt] defines a table
   of session identifying information.  The tables in the RTCP XR MIB
   augment the session data from the RTP MIB V2, providing detailed 
   performance information for RTP sessions transporting Voice over
   IP.  The RTP MIB V2 session table MUST be implemented if the RTCP
   XR MIB Basic Parameter and Call Quality tables are implemented.
   The history table in this MIB contains aggregate information and
   does not have any relationship to the RTP MIB V2 session table.
   In implementations that use only the RTCP XR history table to
   report aggregate data, the RTP MIB V2 session table MUST NOT be
   implemented.

2.4  Relationship to the RAQMON Architecture

   The Real-time Application QoS monitoring (RAQMON) Framework [RAQMON] 
   defines an architecture that extends the Remote Monitoring (RMON) 
   family of applications for monitoring of application QoS in real
   time, and an extensible data model with objects carried between
   RAQMON data sources and RAQMON collectors. The RAQMON work is 
   more generic, and complementary in concept to RTCP-XR, covering a
   wider range of applications running concurrently, while RTCP-XR
   focuses on in-depth QoS monitoring of media traffic in VoIP. 

   The Real-time Application QoS Monitoring (RAQMON) MIB is defined 
   by [xxx] and runs on RAQMON collectors. A performance monitoring
   application may query (i) RAQMON collectors for RAQMON MIB
   information about the QoS parameters of multiple concurrent
   applications (ii) end-points and gateways for in-depth RTCP-XR
   information about the media QoS of VoIP or (iii) both.

2.5  The Structure of the RTCP XR MIB

   There are three tables in the RTCP XR MIB  

   The rtcpXrBasicParametersTable contains basic packet loss, discard 
   and delay related parameters about a session.
 
   The rtcpXrVoiceQualityMetricsTable contains information about the 
   call quality of a session

   The rtcpXrHistoryTable contains aggregate information about a group 
   of sessions.

2.6 Application to multi-party and multicast calls

   The RTCP XR MIB may be applied to multi-party calls.  The RTP MIB
   Session table is defined in terms of uni-directional RTP streams
   from a source to a destination.  

   For a multi-party IP-IP conference call in which parties are 
   directly interconnected in a mesh network, a row should be created
   in the session table for each such interconnection.

   For a multi-party call in which parties are interconnected via
   a bridge function and RTP streams are literally or logically
   terminated at the bridge, a row should be created in the session
   table for the RTP sessions established to and from each endpoint
   and the bridge.

   For a multicast call in which RTP sessions are terminated in
   logical IP addresses from they are redistributed, a row in the
   session table should be created for the source to multicast
   address RTP session.

-- RTCP Extended Reports - Voice over IP Metrics
--
-- Description
--    This MIB module provides basic voice quality monitoring
--    capabilities for Voice-over-packet systems. The MIB contains 
--    3 tables of information that augment the data available in
--    the RTP MIB V2.
--         a table of basic parameters for each Stream
--         a table of call quality metrics for each Stream
--         a table of aggregate statistics for groups of calls
--    the indexes to these tables are imported from the RTP MIB V2
--    and hence this MIB MUST be used in conjunction with at least
--    the RTP session table from that MIB

4.  Security Considerations


   Access to rtcpXrHistoryReset can result in resetting the table of
   aggregate call quality information, which results in the loss of
   useful management data.

   It is thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to
   these objects and possibly to even encrypt their values when sending
   them over the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

5. IANA Considerations

   An OID within the mib-2 tree is requested, following which this note
   may be deleted.
