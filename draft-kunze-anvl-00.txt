Abstract

   ANVL (A Name-Value Language) is a simple record syntax based on email
   headers.  An ANVL record is a sequence of data elements ending in a
   blank line.  An element consists of a label, a colon, and an optional
   value.

   character is treated as if it were not present; this is a "comment"
   line.

Internet Draft             ANVL Record Format              February 2005


1.  A Name-Value Language

   ANVL (A Name-Value Language) is a simple record syntax based on email
   headers [RFC822].  It is generally much simpler than email headers,
   but it adds comment lines, record boundaries, and the assumption of
   UTF-8 [RFC3629] character encoding.

   An ANVL record is a sequence of data elements ending in a blank line.
   An element consists of a label, a colon, and an optional value.  Here
   is an example of a record in the ANVL syntax.

     entry:
     # first draft
     who:   Gilbert, W.S. | Sullivan, Arthur
     what:  The Yeomen of
            the Guard
     when/created:  1888

   A long value may be folded (continued) onto the next line by insert¡
   ing a newline and indenting the next line.  An element value folded
   across several lines is treated as if the lines were joined together
   on one long line, with the end-of-line and any subsequent spaces and
   tabs considered equivalent to exactly one space.  Finally, any line
   beginning with a `#' (hash) character is treated as if it were not
   present; this is a "comment" line.

   The ANVL specification is silent on the nature or lexical composition
   of both names and values.  Other specifications may use ANVL by lay¡
   ering on semantics and additional syntactic rules, but that is out¡
   side the scope of ANVL.

2.  Registration of MIME Media Type text/anvl

   This section describes, as per [RFC2048], the MIME type associated
   with the ANVL format.

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: anvl

   Required parameters: None

   Optional parameters:  None

   Encoding considerations:

   UTF-8 is the default character encoding.  While [RFC2046] (section
   4.1.1) stipulates that "text" types use CRLF (hex 0d + hex 0a) as an
   end-of-line marker, in practice this is not always true (e.g.,
   text/xml).  It is important for applications also to accept CR or LF
   by itself as an end-of-line.

   Security considerations:

   The ANVL record syntax poses no direct risk to computers and
   networks.  Implementors need to be aware of source authority and
   trustworthiness of information structured in ANVL.  Readers and
   writers subject themselves to all the risks that accompany normal
   operation of data processing services (e.g., buffer overflow
   attacks).  Because it discloses and bounds data elements, ANVL may
   actually be used to clarify and secure a communication that would
   otherwise be completely unstructured.

   Interoperability considerations: None

   Published specification: RFC yyy

   Applications which use this media type: Any simple data transfer

   Additional information: none

   Person and email address to contact for further information:

   John Kunze jak@ucop.edu

   Intended usage: COMMON

   Author/Change controller: IESG

3.  IANA Considerations

   After IESG approval, IANA is expected to register the ANVL type
   "text/anvl" using the application provided in this document.
