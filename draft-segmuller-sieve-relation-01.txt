Abstract

  This document describes the RELATIONAL extension to the Sieve mail
  filtering language [SIEVE].  This extension allows relational
  operators on field values and on the number of entities in header
  fields and addresses.

  - Strip leading and trailing spaces when using a match-type of
     ":value".

1 Introduction

  The RELATIONAL extension provides relational operators on the
  address, envelope and header tests.  This extension also provides a
  way of counting the entities in a message header or address field.

  With this extension, the sieve script may now determine if a field is
  greater than or less than a value instead of just equal to.  One use
  is for the x-priority field: move messages with a priority greater
  than 3 to the "work on later" folder.  Mail could also be sorted by
  the from address.  Those userids that start with 'a'-'m' go to one
  folder, and the rest go to another folder.

  The sieve script can also determine the number of fields in the
  header, or the number of addresses in a recipient field.  An example:
  are there more than 5 addresses in the to and cc fields.

2 Conventions used in this document

  Conventions for notations are as in [SIEVE] section 1.1,  including
  use of [KEYWORDS] and "Syntax:" label for the definition of action
  and tagged arguments syntax, and the use of [ABNF]

  The capability string associated with extension defined in this
  document is "relational".

3 Match Type

  This document defines two new match types.  They are the VALUE match
  type and the COUNT match type.

  The syntax is:

     MATCH-TYPE =/ COUNT / VALUE

     COUNT = ":count" relational-match

     VALUE = ":value" relational-match

     relational-match = DQUOTE ( "gt" / "ge" / "lt" 
                                 / "le" / "eq" / "ne" ) DQUOTE

3.1  Match Type Value

  The VALUE match type does a relational comparison between strings.

  The VALUE match type may be used with any comparator which returns
  sort information.

  Leading and trailing white space MUST be removed from the value from
  the message for the comparison.  White space is defined as

     SP / HTAB / CRLF / CR / LF

  A value from the message is considered the left side of the relation.
  A value from the test expression, the key-list for address, envelope,
  and header tests, is the right side of the relation.

  If there are multiple values on either side or both sides, the test
  is considered true if any pair is true.

3.2  Match Type Count

  The COUNT match type first determines the number of the specified
  entities in the message and does a relational comparison of the
  number of entities to the values specified in the test expression.

  The COUNT match type SHOULD only be used with numeric comparators.  A
  suitable comparator is "i;ascii-numeric" which is defined in [ACAP].

  For the Address Test, this counts the number of recipients in the
  specified fields.  Group names are ignored.

  For the Envelope Test, this counts the number of recipients in the
  specified envelope parts.

  For the Header Test, this counts the total number of instances of the
  specified fields.  This does not count individual addresses in the
  "to", "cc", and other recipient fields.

  In all cases, if more than one field name is specified, the counts
  for all specified fields are added together to obtain the number for
  comparison.  Thus, specifying ["to", "cc"] in an address COUNT test
  will compare the total number of "to" and "cc" addresses; if separate
  counts are desired, they must be done in two comparisons, perhaps
  joined by "allof" or "anyof".

4 Security Considerations

  Security considerations are discussed in [SIEVE].

  It is belived that this  extension  doesn't  introduce any additional
  security concerns.

5 Example

  Using the message:

     received: ...
     received: ...
     subject: example
     to: foo@example.com.invalid, baz@example.com.invalid
     cc: qux@example.com.invalid

  The test

       address :count "ge" :comparator "i;ascii-numeric" ["to", "cc"]
     ["3"]

  would be true and the test

       anyof ( address :count "ge" :comparator "i;ascii-numeric" 
                       ["to"] ["3"],
               address :count "ge" :comparator "i;ascii-numeric"
                       ["cc"] ["3"] )

  would be false.

  To check the number of received fields in the header, the following
  test may be used:

       header :count "ge" :comparator "i;ascii-numeric"
                      ["received"] ["3"]

  This would return false.  But 

       header :count "ge" :comparator "i;ascii-numeric" 
                        ["received", "subject"] ["3"]

  would return true.

  The test:

       header :count "ge" :comparator "i;ascii-numeric" 
                     ["to", "cc"] ["3"]

  will always return false on an RFC 822 compliant message [RFC822],
  since a message can have at most one "to" field and at most one "cc"
  field.  This test counts the number of fields, not the number of
  addresses.

6 Extended Example

  require "relational";

  if header :value "lt" :comparator "i;ascii-numeric" 
            ["x-priority"] ["3"]
  {
     fileinto "Priority";
  }

  elseif address :count "gt" :comparator "i;ascii-numeric" 
             ["to"] ["5"]
  { 
     # everything with more than 5 recipients in the "to" field
     # is considered SPAM
     fileinto "SPAM";
  }

  elseif address :value "gt" :all :comparator "i;ascii-casemap" 
             ["from"] ["M"]
