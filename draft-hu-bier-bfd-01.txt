1.  Introduction

   Bit Index Explicit Replication(BIER)[RFC8279] provides optimal
   forwarding of multicast data packets through a multicast domain.  It
   does so without requiring any explicit tree-building protocol and
   without requiring intermediate nodes to maintain any per-flow state.

   [I-D.ietf-bfd-multipoint] defines a method of using Bidirectional
   Detection(BFD) to monitor and detect unicast failures between the
   sender (head) and one or more receivers (tails) in multipoint or
   multicast networks.

   This document describes the procedures for using such mode of BFD
   protocol to verify multipoint or multicast connectivity between a
   multipoint sender (the "head", Bit-Forwarding Ingress Routers(BFIRs))
   and a set of one or more multipoint receivers (the"tails", Bit-
   Forwarding Egress Routers(BFERs)).  The BIER BFD only supports the
   unidirectional multicast.  This document defines use of the point-to-
   multipoint BFD for BIER domain.

2.1.  Terminology

   This document uses the acronyms defined in [RFC8279] along with the
   following:

   BFD: Bidirectional Forwarding Detection.

   NLPID: Network Layer Protocol Identifier.

   OAM: Operations, Administration, and Maintenance.

   P2MP: Point to Multi-Point.

2.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  BIER BFD Encapsulation

   BIER BFD encapsulation uses the BIER OAM packet format defined in
   [I-D.ietf-bier-ping].  If the Msg type field is 3(TBD, it is assigned
   by IANA), it indicates that the OAM packet is BIER BFD packet.

   The message type of OAM packet is defined as the following:

                   +-------+----------+---------------+
                   |  Type |  Value   |   Reference   |
                   +-------+----------+---------------+
                   |   3   | BIER BFD | This document |
                   +-------+----------+---------------+

                                  Table 1

4.  Bootstrapping BIER BFD

4.1.  One-hop Bootstrapping

   The ISIS BFD-Enable TLV is defined in [RFC6213], which could be used
   for BIER BFD bootstrapping if the underlay routing protocol is ISIS
   routing protocol.  When the adjacency between BIER nodes reaches the
   2-Way state, ISIS Hellos will already have been exchanged.  If an
   BIER node supports BFD, it will have learned whether the other BIER
   node has BFD enabled by whether or not a BFD-Enabled TLV was included
   in its Hellos.  The BFD-Enable TLV format is defined in [RFC6213] and

   reused in this document.  The MT ID is the BIER multi-topology
   identify.  If the BIER node only supports single ISIS topology, the
   MT ID is zero.  The NLPIDs encoded in the TLV are defined in
   [ISO9577].

4.2.  Multi-hop Bootstrapping

   The BIER OAM ping could be used for BIER BFD bootstrap.  The
   multipoint header sends the BIER OAM packet with Target SI-Bitstring
   TLV (section 3.3.2 of [I-D.ietf-bier-ping]) carrying the set of BFER
   information (Sub-domain-id, Set ID, BS Len, Bitstring) to the
   multipoint tails to bootstrap the BIER BFD sessions.

5.  Discriminators and Packet Demultiplexing

   The tail(BFER) demultiplexes incoming BFD packets based on a
   combination of the source address and My discriminator as specified
   in [I-D.ietf-bfd-multipoint].  The source address is BFIR-id and BIER
   MPLS Label(MPLS network) or BFIR-id and BIFT-id(Non-MPLS network)for
   BIER BFD.

6.  Security Considerations

   For BIER OAM packet procssing security considerations, see
   [I-D.ietf-bier-ping].

   For general multipoint BFD security considerations, see
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-multipoint].

   No additional security issues are raised in this document beyond
   those that exist in the referenced BFD documents.

   Authors would like to thank the comments and suggestions from Jeffrey
   (Zhaohui) Zhang, Donald Eastlake 3rd.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign new type from the BIER OAM Message Type
   registry as follows:
