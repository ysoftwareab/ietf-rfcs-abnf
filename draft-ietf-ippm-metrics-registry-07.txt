Abstract


   This memo defines a registry for IP Performance Metrics (IPPM).  It
   assigns and registers an initial set of OBJECT IDENTITIES to
   currently defined metrics in the IETF.


   This memo also defines the rules for adding new IP Performance
   Metrics that are defined in the future.  There are branches for other
   standards bodies and enterprises defined to encourage all IP
   performance metrics to be registered here.


   IANA has been assigned to administer this new registry.

Internet-Draft      IP Performance Metrics Registry            June 2004



1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework


   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual
   information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
   MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network
   Management Protocol (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the
   mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).
   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2,
   which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579
   [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].


2.  Overview


   This memo defines a registry of the current metrics and a framework
   for the integration of future metrics for the following reasons:


   o  to permit metrics to be clearly referenced by MIB modules or other
      data models;


   o  Metrics identifiers are needed to allow measurement
      interoperability; As specification of new metrics is a continuous
      process, special care must be taken for the integration of future
      standardized metrics;


   o  Since the intent of the IPPM WG is to cooperate with other
      appropriate standards bodies (or fora) to promote consistent
      metrics, a branch where other standards bodies can register their
      metrics is provided to encourage IP performance metrics to have
      OBJECT IDENTITIES rooted at a common point;


   o  Similarly, a branch is provided for registered enterprises to
      register metrics.



3.  IP Performance Metrics Registry Framework


   MIB modules need to be able to precisely reference IPPM Metrics.  The
   registry associates an OBJECT-IDENTITY with each metric.  As an
   example Type-P-One-way-Delay and Type-P-One-way-Delay-Poisson-Stream
   have different OBJECT IDENTITIES.


   The registry has 3 main branches.  The origin of the document
   defining the metrics determines the node which branch the metric is
   identified in:


   o  Metrics defined by IETF are identified in the




Stephan                Expires December 28, 2004                [Page 3]
Internet-Draft      IP Performance Metrics Registry            June 2004



      'ianaIppmIetfMetrics' tree;


   o  Metrics defined in cooperation with standards bodies or fora may
      be identified in the 'ianaIppmForaMetrics' tree.


   o  Vendors may register private metrics in the
      'ianaIppmEnterprisesMetrics' tree.


   This document defines an initial registry of the existing metrics and
   the rules to manage the registry.


   Documents defining metrics in the future will include in the IANA
   section the registration information to unambiguously identify these
   metrics.


4.  Initial IPPM Metrics Registry Creation


   The initial registry identifies the metrics currently defined in the
   RFCs produced in the IPPM WG.  To date, the IPPM WG defined 33
   metrics related to 7 topics:


   o  IPPM Metrics for Measuring Connectivity, RFC 2678 [RFC2678];


   o  One-way Delay Metrics, RFC 2679  [RFC2679];


   o  One-way Packet Loss Metrics, RFC 2680 [RFC2680];


   o  Round-trip Delay Metrics, RFC 2681 [RFC2681];


   o  One-way Loss Pattern Sample Metrics, RFC 3357 [RFC3357];


   o  IP Packet Delay Variation Metric, RFC 3393 [RFC3393];


   o  IPPM Metrics for periodic streams, RFC 3432 [RFC3432];



5.  IANA Considerations


   This section describes the rules for the management of the registry
   by IANA.


5.1  Management rules


   Registrations are done by IANA on the bases of 'Specification
   Required' as defined in [RFC2434].


   The reference of the specification must point to a stable document
   including a title, a revision and a date.




Stephan                Expires December 28, 2004                [Page 4]
Internet-Draft      IP Performance Metrics Registry            June 2004



5.1.1  Naming Conventions


   The name of the metric in the registry must respect the SMIv2 rules
   for descriptors defined in the section 3.1 of [RFC2578]:


   o  Descriptors longer than 32 characters are not recommended;


   o  Initial character must be a lower-case letter;


   o  Hyphens are not allowed;


   The following rules are applied to allocate the name and the
   identifier of a metric:


   o  The name always starts with the name of the organization;


   o  OBJECT IDENTITIES for metrics are sequentially numbered by IANA;


   o  A OBJECT IDENTITY assigned to a metric is definitive and cannot be
      reused;


   o  If a new version of a metric is produced then it is assigned with
      a new name and a new identifier.



5.1.2  Metrics Defined by IETF


   Such metrics are registered in the node ianaIppmIetfMetrics(1).  The
   guidelines used for the existing metrics, and encouraged for new
   metrics, are


   o  The name always starts with the prefix 'ietf'.


   o  'Type-P' prefix is removed.


   o  '-' are removed;


   o  The letter following a '-' is changed to upper case;



5.1.3  Metrics Defined in Cooperation with Standards bodies or Fora


   IANA already assigns enterprises with unambiguous identifiers named
   enterprise numbers or vendorID.  See
   http://www.iana.org/numbers.html.


   o  An organisation without an entreprise number should apply for one;





Stephan                Expires December 28, 2004                [Page 5]
Internet-Draft      IP Performance Metrics Registry            June 2004



   o  IANA registers the metrics of an organisation under the branch
      ianaIppmForaMetrics(2), in the subtree corresponding to its
      enterprise number.


   o  The name of the metric always starts with (an abbreviation of) the
      name of the organization.


   For example, if the organisation ForumA has been assigned {
   enterprises 696 }, it will register its metrics in the subtree
   ianaIppmMetricsRegistry(x).ianaIppmForaMetrics(2).696.  The name of a
   metric starts with the prefix 'ForumA'.


   Nothing prevents these bodies from registering metrics in their own
   OBJECT INDENTIFIER trees.


5.1.4  Entreprise Metrics Registration


   IANA already assigns enterprises with unambiguous identifiers named
   enterprise numbers or vendorID.  See
   http://www.iana.org/numbers.html.


   o  An enterprise without an entreprise number should apply for one;


   o  IANA registers the metrics of an enterprise under the branch
      ianaIppmEnterprisesMetrics(3), in the subtree corresponding to its
      enterprise number.


   o  The name of the metric always starts with (an abbreviation of) the
      name of the company.


   For example, if Acme Networks has been assigned { enterprises 696 },
   it will register its metrics in the subtree
   ianaIppmMetricsRegistry(x).ianaIppmEnterprisesMetrics(3).696.  The
   name of a metric starts with the prefix 'Acme'.


5.2  Registration templates


   A document that creates new Metrics would have an IANA considerations
   section in which it would describe new metrics to register.


5.2.1  IETF RFCs


   For each metric, that section would have a statement aka:

      IANA-IPPM-METRICS-REGISTRY-MIB:

7.  Security Considerations


   This module does not define any management objects.  Instead, it
   assigns a set of OBJECT-IDENTITIES which may be used by other MIB
   modules to identify specific IP Performance Metrics.


   Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB
   modules that define management objects.  This document has therefore
   no impact on the security of the Internet.
