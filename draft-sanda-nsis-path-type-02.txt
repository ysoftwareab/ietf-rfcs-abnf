Abstract 
   
  NSIS state management needs to track data path changes and update the 
  states along the affected data paths. However, in certain scenarios, 
  there are multiple concurrent paths involved in the communication. In 
  this case, the normal NSIS scheme does not provide sufficient support 
  for the state manipulation. Therefore, extra functionality for data 
  path identification and distinction is necessary. In current Internet, 
  with the increasing use of multi-homing devices and the employment of 
  Mobile IP, the above issue is getting more prominent. This draft 
  discusses in detail the problems and issues involved in the NSIS 
  state management relevant to the data path differentiation. Specific 
  scenarios for multi-homing and Mobile IP route optimization are

1. Introduction 
   
  In the defined NSIS framework [2], a two-layer architecture is used, 
  wherein the NTLP layer handles the general message routing and 
  transport and NSLP layer carries out the actual signaling application. 
  The GIMPS draft [3] defines the NTLP layer, and the QoS NSLP draft 
  [4] specifies an instance of the NSLP signaling application for the 
  QoS provisioning and control. These drafts specify that each 
  signaling path state is managed with two identifiers, i.e. the flow 
  identifier (Flow ID) and the session identifier (Session ID). 
   
  In certain scenarios, communication nodes utilize plural data paths 
  for one session. For example, a terminal that has multiple 
  communication interfaces may communicate with the Correspondent Node 
  (CN) using multiple data paths via multiple links for one session. 
  For these multi-homed cases, the network may observe several path 
  reservations even without any terminal movement. Therefore, special 
  techniques have to be employed to distinguish this from an actual 
  mobility event, so that no mobility handling procedure would be

  triggered. Another example is the Route Optimization (RO) in the 
  Mobile IP environment. When a successful RO is performed, data will 
  flow directly between the CN and the Mobile Node (MN) without going 
  through the Home Agent (HA). Since the RO procedure makes use of the 
  triangular (TR) path (path via the HA), it will always happen after 
  the TR path is set up. Even after RO procedure is completed, TR path 
  will be used when RO path is down. This means that the MN may use 
  multiple paths to communicate with the CN. In the RO procedure, there 
  is always a data path change involved, even though there is no actual 
  address change.  
   
  It is obvious from the above that the Flow ID and Session ID defined 
  [3,4] are not sufficient to support these more complicated 
  reservation management, when multiple data paths are involved. In 
  this draft, details of the problems and a solution using a Path Type 
  ID are discussed. Impacts on the current protocol design, and the 
  advantage and disadvantage of each solution are also analyzed in the 
  subsections of the draft.  
   
   
2. Terminology 
   
  The Terminology defined in [3,4,6] applies to this draft. In addition, 
  the following terms are used: 
   
  TR path:  Triangular Path. A route between MN and CN with tunneled 
   
  RO path:  Route Optimized path. A direct route between MN and CN 
   
   
3. Multi-interface terminal scenario 
3.1 Problems in multi-interface terminal scenario 
   
  It is common nowadays for a terminal to be equipped with multiple 
  communication technologies. For example, it is nature to have a 
  combination of Ethernet, Wireless LAN, InfraRed, and Bluetooth 
  interfaces installed on a laptop. Those best selling PDAs usually 
  have cellular and Wireless LAN interfaces. In this draft, a multi-
  interface terminal is defined as one that can utilize more than two 
  interfaces for one communication session. With the advance of the 
  interworking study, e.g. IEEE802.11u and IEEE802.21, this may become 
  a normal practice. In this case, multiple data paths are used for the 
  communication simultaneously. Furthermore, if the interfaces are 
  wireless, such as 802.11 WLAN, UMTS and so on, each interface can 
  switch its attachment point independently. This means data paths are 
  changed separately. 
   
  The scenario discussed here is shown in Figure 1. MN is communicating 
  with CN using two interfaces, "p" and "s", for one session. Interface

  "p" has a data path (Path1) via AP1, AR1 and QNE1 while interface "s" 
  has a data path (Path2) via AP2, AR2 and QNE1. According to the NSIS 
  draft [3,4], QoS state would be installed on each data path and the 
  same Session ID and different Flow IDs would be allocated for them.

  When the interface "s" performs a handover from AP2 to AP3 as shown 
  in Figure 1(b), QoS state for Path2 is replaced by Path3, while Path1 
  should be maintained. In this case, QNE1 needs to know which 
  path/state must be replaced by Path3. However, since Flow ID for 
  Path1, Path2 and Path3 are different and Session IDs for all paths 
  are the same, it is impossible for QNE1 to know how to operate each 
  path.

  A possible solution for this is to have the MN indicate which path to 
  be maintained or replaced explicitly by specifying the specific Flow 
  ID to replace in an extra message exchange with the QNEs, which will 
  increase signaling overhead. 
   
3.2 Solution with Path Type ID utilization 
   
  In the scenario discussed in sec. 3.1, it is desirable for QNE1 to 
  determine which path/state should be replaced or maintained with 
  minimal signaling exchanges. For this purpose, each QNE could utilize 
  a new identifier called "Path Type ID", which identifies a MN's 
  interface. Path type ID is indicated in RESERVE messages. Each QoS 
  state in QNEs has a Path Type ID as well as a Session ID and a Flow 
  ID so that QNE can differentiate MN's interfaces without explicit 
  signaling. In the scenario in Figure 1(b), Path Type ID for Path2 and 
  Path3 is an identical code or number (e.g., "s"), which is different 
  from that for Path1 (e.g., "p").  
   
   
4. Mobile IP scenario 
4.1 Problems in Mobile IP RO scenario 
   
  As described in MIPv6 [6], the RO will be performed if both the MN 
  and the CN supports it. With optimization, data traffic will flow 
  directly between MN and CN without going through the HA. This 
  improves the efficiency of network resources utilization, and reduces 
  the communication dependency on the MN's Home network. 
   
  Due to the MIPv6 security requirements, a Return Routability 
  procedure must be carried out during the RO. Therefore, the data path 
  through the HA needs to be available before the RO is carried out.  
   
  The relationship between a RO path and TR path is special. They are 
  separate data paths, with different characteristics, but they are 
  also related since the MN is actually at the same location using the 
  same CoA. The MN could communicate with the CN using different path 
  at different stage of the session. Moreover, when the MN moves to a 
  new location, the TR path will need to be used again. Therefore, the 
  change of the data path in RO procedure is different from that 
  resulted from a MN changing its point of attachment. 
   
  The NSIS signaling for the TR path and RO path of the same session 
  may have overlapped sections. When NSIS QoS state is installed, 
  double resource reservation over these paths needs to be avoided. To 
  this end, mechanisms similar to those for a MN handover could be used. 
  However, unlike path change caused by MN's movement, MN is still 
  reachable to CN via the TR path in RO case. TR path would be reused 
  when RO path is aborted, or MN moves to a new location. Therefore

Internet-Draft  Path type support for NSIS signaling   February 2005 
 
 
  reservation state for the old path, i.e. TR path, may have to be kept. 
  Simultaneously, reserved resource for TR path may have to be reduced 
  not to waste limited resources. Signaling management for each path 
  would also need to be done separately, depending on control policies. 
   
  Reservation state handling for TR path and RO path requires more 
  flexibility than state handling for path changes caused by MN's move 
  or re-routing. To realize flexible operation, it is desirable that 
  every NSIS Node could differentiate RO path and TR path reservation 
  state with NSIS protocols. 
   
  Figure 2 shows one example scenario of TR path and RO path with MN 
  A's movement. Each QNE along overlapping sections needs to recognize 
  each path and decide on how to operate the states, e.g. which paths 
  are required to be replaced or refreshed.

  When identifiers are manipulated as specified by the current NSIS 
  protocols, there are two ways to differentiate the TR and RO paths.  
   
  One possible method is to use different Session IDs to identify each 
  path. In this case, each path will be treated as an independent 
  session and would be managed separately. For example in Figure 2, the 
  TR path (between CN B and MN A at location1, i.e. path x) and the RO 
  path (between CN B and MN A at location1, i.e. path y) can be 
  differentiated by QNEs easily since the Session IDs used are 
  different. Differentiations between TR paths at different locations 
  (e.g. path x and path z), and RO paths at different locations (e.g.

  path y and path w) are also easy because corresponding Flow ID 
  changes when MN moves. However, using different Session IDs for TR 
  and RO paths means that a session binding function is needed to 
  associate the two paths at the same location to avoid double 
  reservation. Besides, when a MN performs handover, session binding 
  needs to be modified according to the change of crossover node 
  between TR and RO paths. This operation could be complicated and will 
  be initiated by MN because only MN knows which path is TR or RO path. 
  This reduces the flexibility of the NSIS protocols, and adds burden 
  to MN that has limited resources, e.g. computation power and memory.  
   
  Another possible method for TR and RO path handling is to use the 
  same Session ID. In this case, session binding function is not 
  necessary. However, QNEs (such as QNE1 and QNE3 in Figure 2) cannot 
  distinguish the path change caused by RO procedure from that caused 
  by MN's movement. Besides, when a MN performs handover, a crossover 
  node (such as QNE4 in Figure 2) cannot distinguish which path/state 
  must be replaced or maintained without explicit signaling that 
  designates specific Flow ID from MN. 
   
   
4.2 Solution with Path Type ID utilization 
   
  As discussed in Sec. 4.1, current NSIS protocol design cannot 
  indicate the complicated relationship between TR path and RO path in 
  the signaling. Since the RO is common for a MIPv6 enable network, 
  NSIS protocols cannot support mobility properly without a solution to 
  this problem. 
   
  The general problem is regarding how to differentiate the TR and RO 
  paths. Since the Flow ID is not able to indicate that, some extra 
  information element is necessary. For this purpose, each QNE could 
  utilize "Path Type ID", which identifies the TR and RO paths. Path 
  type ID is indicated in RESERVE messages. Each QoS state in QNEs has 
  a Path Type ID as well as a Session ID and a Flow ID so that QNE can 
  differentiate the TR and RO paths without explicit signaling. In the 
  scenario in Figure 2, Path Type ID for paths "x" and "z" is an 
  identical code or number (e.g., "TR") while Path Type ID for paths 
  "y" and "w" is also identical but different from that for paths "x" 
  and "z" (e.g., "RO"). Since it is short, certain reserved fields of 
  NSIS message header could be used to carry it. Therefore, minimum 
  overhead would be added to the signaling. 
   
  MN can decide Path Type ID by the information from MIP layer, e.g. 
  receiving Binding ACK message, and then set the Path Type ID in 
  RESERVE message.  
   
  In the case with same Session ID and different Flow IDs, when states 
  for path x followed by path y are installed, QNE1 and QNE3 could

  distinguish the path change caused by RO procedure from that caused 
  by MN's movement. Flexible operation for these two paths is also 
  possible. Even when MN A moves to location 2, QNEs could still 
  distinguish the old path and new path by comparing Path Type ID and 
  Flow ID. However, the method to explicitly associate TR path and RO 
  path at the same location may be required. For supporting this 
  functionality, an object to decide MN's location, such as 
  mobility_event_counter mentioned in Applicability Statement draft [5] 
  could be useful. 
   
   
5. Other requirements relevant to NSIS identifiers 
5.1 Use of packet classifier vs. Flow ID 
   
  In the current NSIS protocol [3,4], it is suggesting that the Flow ID 
  should contain the data packet routing information, and that it would 
  be used for classifying the data traffic. However, this may cause 
  problems in a complicated scenario. A few examples are given below:  
   
  a) In some scenarios, reservation pre-setup would be necessary. One 
  example is the state pre-establishment in a mobile environment, e.g. 
  a proxy establishes a new path before a MN's actual movement. In this 
  case, full information to classify data packets, e.g. MN's new CoA, 
  may not be available at the first time. If the Flow ID is employed as 
  the data packet classifier, it is impossible for a proxy to generate 
  the Flow ID, and time will be wasted for the proxy to wait for MN 
  obtaining the new CoA. However, if the Flow ID is not related to the 
  packet classifier, the proxy can create a Flow ID with, for example, 
  proxy's IP address instead of MN's CoA, and can send signaling 
  messages for installing GIMPS state along the new path and for 
  discovering the CRN. 
   
  Another example is the scheduled reservation, i.e. resource 
  reservation for pre-set time such as scheduled teleconference. This 
  case, full information to classify data packets, e.g. port numbers, 
  may not be available. However, if Flow ID can only be used for 
  signaling path management, port numbers would not always be necessary 
  in it. 
   
  Therefore, the separation of Flow ID from data packet classifier 
  information is necessary.  
   
  b) Nowadays, a communication session usually contains several threads, 
  e.g. a FTP client would create 3 to 5 threads simultaneously to boost 
  up the downloading speed. Therefore, packets for the same session may 
  bear different address attributes. In this case, the current Flow ID 
  is not sufficient for the classification of the data packets for a 
  session.  
   
 
 
T. Sanda et al.         Expires - August 2005                [Page 9] 

Internet-Draft  Path type support for NSIS signaling   February 2005 
 
 
  For example, in a FTP session, a user terminal would fork up several 
  threads, with each taking a local port, say 10001 and 10002. When 
  connected to the FTP server, different ports would be allocated for 
  these threads, say 21001 and 21002. If NSIS is to be used for the QoS 
  management for this session, a single Flow ID is not able to 
  represent the different ports involved in the session.  
   
  Although wildcarding is mentioned in [3], it still does not solve the 
  problem, especially there are other sessions exist between these two 
  nodes. For example, the same user may be accessing AV streaming from 
  the same server at the same time using port 10003 and 10004. 
  Wildcarding would not be able to support separation of the FTP and AV 
  streaming sessions.  
   
  Multimedia application is another widely used example of multi-port 
  communications. When the RTP is employed for AV streaming/conference, 
  different RTP sessions would be used for audio and video streams. So, 
  NSIS would face the same problem if the audio and video streams are 
  to be managed as one NSIS session. When aggregation happened, the 
  multi-port communication would also be incurred. This mainly occurs 
  on NSIS nodes that is not the communication ends. 
        
  With the above example, it is clear that using the Flow ID as the 
  packet classifier does not support the most commonly used 
  applications over the Internet. Thus, a classifier that can represent 
  multiple address attributes should be separated from the Flow ID. 
   
   
  c) As discussed in draft [3,5], a Flow ID will be generated based on 
  the protocol address information. For the RO path in Mobile IP 
  scenario, it is quite obvious that the Flow ID would be based on the 
  CoA of the MN and the CN address. However for a TR path there are 
  tunnels involved between MN and HA. Therefore, several combinations 
  are possible for the use of Flow IDs to represent the paths in NSIS 
  signaling. Generally, there are three options:  
    - Flow ID based on HoA of MN and CN address for the whole TR path; 
     - Combination of Flow ID based on CoA of MN and HA address for 
     tunneled section and Flow ID based on HoA of MN and CN address for 
     section between HA and CN; 
     - Flow ID based on CoA of MN and CN address for the whole TR path. 
      
  In first case and third case, Flow ID could not be used as packet 
  classifier because header information for TR path is not the same as 
  what is used to generate Flow ID. Therefore, packet classifier should 
  be considered separately from Flow ID.  
   
  Usually, the data packet classifying information depends on the NSLP 
  application, e.g. the QoS Model used. Therefore, it would be proper 
  to include that in the NSLP layer, e.g. in the QSpec. Some object

  like FlowSpec would be useful in QSpec to indicate the actual packet 
  filter information.   
   
 
6. Security Considerations 
   
  Security should be considered in the NTLP/NSLP specifications as an 
  integrated part. Specific issues in Route Optimization case will be 
  essentially covered by the Route Optimization security in Mobile IPv6 
  [6]. Future version of this draft would discuss the relevant security 
  requirements for the solutions in detail. 
   
7. Conclusions 
   
  This draft discussed potential problems related to NSIS QoS state 
  management for multiple paths caused by multi-interface terminal and 
  Mobile IP RO procedures. As one possible solution, Path Type ID was 
  introduced so that QNEs could perform flexible state management for 
  each path. 
   
  This draft also includes some other discussions relevant to the 
  problems on usage of Flow ID as a packet classifier. Use cases are 
  analyzed with regarding to the requirements.
