Internet-Draft       Calendar Access Protocol (CAP)        November 2002


1. Introduction

   This document specifies how a Calendar CUA interacts with a CS to
   manage calendar information.  In particular, it specifies how to
   query, create, modify, and delete iCalendar components (e.g., events,
   to-dos, or daily journal entries).  It further specifies how to
   search for available busy time information.  Synchronization with
   CUAs is not covered.

   CAP is specified as a BEEP "profile".  As such, many aspects of the
   protocol (e.g., authentication and privacy) are provided within
   [BEEP].  The protocol data units leverage the standard iCalendar
   format [iCAL] to convey calendar related information.

   CAP can also be used to store and fetch [iTIP] objects and when those
   objects are used in this memo, they mean exactly the same as defined
   in [iTIP].  When iCalendar objects are transfered between the CUA and
   a CS, some additional properties and parameters may be added and the
   CUA is responsible for correctly generating iCalendar objects to non
   CAP processes.

   The definition of new components, properties, parameter's, and value
   types are broken into two parts.  The first part summarizes and
   defined the new objects.  The second part provides the detail and any
   ABNF for those objects.

1.1 Formatting Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFCWORDS].

   Calendaring and scheduling roles are referred to in quoted-strings of
   text with the first character of each word in upper case.  For
   example, "Organizer" refers to a role of a "Calendar User" (CU)
   within the protocol defined by [iTIP].  Calendar components defined
   by [iCAL] are referred to with capitalized, quoted-strings of text.
   All iCalendar components should start with the letter "V".  For
   example, "VEVENT" refers to the event calendar component, "VTODO"
   refers to the to-do component and "VJOURNAL" refers to the daily
   journal component.

   Scheduling methods defined by [iTIP], are referred to with
   capitalized, quoted-strings of text.  For example, "REPLY" refers to
   the method for replying to a "REQUEST".

   CAP commands are referred to by upper-case, quoted-strings of text,
   followed by the word "command".  For example, "CREATE" command refers

Internet-Draft       Calendar Access Protocol (CAP)        November 2002


   to the command for creating a calendar entry, "SEARCH" command refers
   to the command for reading calendar components.  CAP Commands are
   named using the "CMD" property.

   Properties defined by this memo are referred to with capitalized,
   quoted-strings of text, followed by the word "property".  For
   example, "ATTENDEE" property refers to the iCalendar property used to
   convey the calendar address that has been invited to a "VEVENT" or
   "VTODO" component.

   Property parameters defined by this memo are referred to with
   capitalized, quoted-strings of text, followed by the word
   "parameter".  For example, "PARTSTAT" parameter refers to the
   iCalendar property parameter used to specify the participation status
   of an attendee.  Enumerated values defined by this memo are referred
   to with capitalized text, either alone or followed by the word
   "value".

   Object states defined by this memo are referred to with capitalized,
   quoted-strings of text, followed by the word "state".  For example,
   "BOOKED" state refers to an object in the booked state.

   Within a query, the different parts are referred to as a "clause" and
   its value as "clause value" and the clause name will be in uppercase
   enclosed in quotes.  Example, The "SELECT" clause or if the "SELECT"
   clause value contains ...

   In tables, the quoted-string text is specified without quotes in
   order to minimize the table length.

1.2 Related Documents

   Implementers will need to be familiar with several other memos that,
   along with this one, describe the Internet calendaring and scheduling
   standards.  These documents are:

   [iCAL] -  (RFC2445) Which specifies the objects, data types,
      properties and property parameters used in the protocols, along
      with the methods for representing and encoding them.

   [iTIP] -  (RFC2446) Which specifies an interoperability protocol for
      scheduling between different installations.

   [iMIP] -  (RFC2447) Which specifies the Internet email binding for
      [iTIP].

   [GUIDE] -  (RFC3283),  a guide to implementers and describes the
      elements of a calendaring system, how they interact with each

Internet-Draft       Calendar Access Protocol (CAP)        November 2002


      other, how they interact with end users, and how the standards and
      protocols are used.

   This memo does not attempt to repeat the specification of concepts
   and definitions from these other memos.  Where possible, references
   are made to the memo that provides for the specification of these
   concepts and definitions.

1.3 Definitions

   BOOKED -  An obect in the calendar store has one of three conceptual
      states.  It is "UNPROCESSED" state, "BOOKED" state or marked as
      "DELETED" state.  How the implementation stores the state of any
      object is not a protocol issues and is not discussed.  An object
      can be said to be booked, unprocessed, or marked for delete.



      1.  An "UNPROCESSED" state scheduling object has been stored in
          the calendar store but has not been acted on by a CU or CUA.
          All scheduled entries are [iTIP] objects.  All [iTIP] objects
          in the store are not in the "BOOKED" state.  To retrieve any
          [iTIP] object, simply do a query asking for any objects that
          were stored in the "UNPROCESSED" state.

      2.  A "BOOKED" state entry is stored with the "CREATE" command.
          It is an object that has  been acted on by a CU or CUA and
          there has been a decision to store an object.  To retrieve any
          booked object, simply do a query asking for any objects that
          were stored in the "BOOKED" state.

      3.  A "DELETED" state entry is created by sending a "DELETE"
          command with the "OPTION" parameter value set to "MARK".  To
          retrieve any deleted object, simply do a query asking for any
          objects that were stored in the "DELETED" state.  By default
          objects marked for delete are not returned.  The CUA must
          specifically ask for marked for delete objects.  You can not
          ask for components in the "DELETED" state and in other states
          in the same "VQUERY" component, as there would be no way to
          distinguish between them in the reply.

   Calendar -  A collection of logically related objects or entities
      each of which may be associated with a calendar date and possibly
      time of day.  These entities can include calendar properties or
      components.  In addition, a calendar might be related to other
      calendars with the "RELATED-TO" property.  A calendar is
      identified by its unique calendar identifier.  The [iCAL] defines
      the initial calendar properties, calendar components and

      properties that make up the contents of a calendar.

   Calendar Access Protocol (CAP) -  The standard Internet protocol that
      permits a CUA to access and manipulate calendars residing on a
      Calendar Store.  (this memo)

   Calendar Access Rights (VCAR) -  The mechanism for specifying the CAP
      operations ("PERMISSION") that a particular calendar user ("UPN")
      is granted or denied permission to perform on a given calendar
      object ("SCOPE").  The calendar access rights are specified with a
      "VCAR" component.

   Calendar Address -  Also See Calendar URL - they are one in the same
      for CAP addresses.  The calendar address can also be the value to
      the "ATTENDEE" and "ORGANIZER" properties as defined in [iCAL].

   Calendar URL -  A calendar URL is a URL defined in this memo that
      specifies the address of a CS or Calendar.

   Component-  Any object that conforms to the iCalendar object format
      and that is either defined in an internet draft, registered with
      IANA, or is an experimental object that is prefixed with "x-".
      Some types of components include calendars, events, to-dos,
      journals, alarms, and time zones.  A component consists of
      properties and possibly other contained components.  For example,
      an event may contain an alarm component.

   Container -  This is a generic name for VCALSTORE or VAGENDA.

   Properties -  An attribute of a particular component.  Some
      properties are applicable to  different types of components.  For
      example, the "DTSTART" property is applicable to the "VEVENT",
      "VTODO", and "VJOURNAL" components.  Other components are
      applicable only to an individual type of calendar component.  For
      example, the "TZURL" property may only be applicable to the
      "VTIMEZONE" components.

   Calendar Identifier (CalID) -  A globally unique identifier
      associated with a calendar.  Calendars reside within a CS.  See
      Qualified Calendar Identifier and Relative Calendar Identifier.
      All CalIDs start with "cap:".

   Calendar Policy -  A CAP operational restriction on the access or
      manipulation of a calendar.  These may be outside of the scope of
      the CAP protocol.  An example of an implementation or site policy
      is, "events MUST BE scheduled in unit intervals of one hour".

   Calendar Property -  An attribute of a calendar ("VAGENDA").  The

Internet-Draft       Calendar Access Protocol (CAP)        November 2002


      attribute applies to the calendar, as a whole.  For example, the
      "CALSCALE" property specifies the calendar scale (e.g., the
      "GREGORIAN" value) for the all entries within the calendar.

   Calendar Store (CS) -  The data and service model definition for a
      Calendar Store as defined in this memo.  This memo does not
      specify how the CS is implemented.

   Calendar Server -  An implementation of a Calendar Store (CS) that
      manages one or more calendars.

   Calendar Store Identifier (CSID) -  The globally unique identifier
      for an individual CS.  A CSID consists of the host and port
      portions of a "Common Internet Scheme Syntax" part of a URL, as
      defined by [URL].  The CSID excludes any reference to a specific
      calendar.

   Calendar Store Components -  Components maintained in a CS specify a
      grouping of calendar store-wide information.

   Calendar Store Properties -  Properties maintained in a Calendar
      Store calendar store-wide information.

   Calendar User (CU) -  An entity (often biological) that uses a
      calendaring system.

   Calendar User Agent (CUA) -  The client application that a CU
      utilizes to access and manipulate a calendar.

   CAP Session -  An open communication channel between a CUA and a
      Calendar Server.  If the CAP session is authenticated, the CU is
      "authenticated" and it is an "authenticated CAP session".

   Contained Component / Contained Properties -  A component or property
      that is contained inside of another component.  A "VALARM"
      component for example may be contained inside of a "VEVENT"
      component.  And a "TRIGGER" property could be a contained property
      of a "VALARM" component.

   Delegate -  A CU (sometimes called the delegatee) who has been
      assigned participation in a scheduled component (e.g., VEVENT) by
      one of the attendees in the scheduled component (sometimes called
      the delegator).  An example of a delegate is a team member told to
      go to a particular meeting in place of another Attendee who is
      unable to attend.

   Designate -  A CU who is authorized to act on behalf of another CU.
      An example of a designate is an assistant.

Internet-Draft       Calendar Access Protocol (CAP)        November 2002


   Experiential -  The CUA and CS may implement experimental extensions
      to the protocol.  They also might have experimental components,
      properties, and parameters.  These extensions MUST start with "x-"
      (or "X-") and should include a vendor prefix (such as "x-myvendor-
      ").  There is no guarantee that these experimental extensions will
      interoperate with other implementations.  There is no guarantee
      that they will not interact in unpredictable ways with other
      vendor experimental extensions.  Implementations should limit
      sending those extensions to other implementations.

   Object -  A generic name for any component, property, parameter, or
      value type to be used in iCalendar.

   Overlapped Booking -  A policy which indicates whether or not
      components with a "TRANSP" property not set to "TRANSPARENT-
      NOCONFLICT" or "OPAQUE-NOCONFLICT" value can overlap one another.
      When the policy is applied to a calendar it indicates whether or
      not the time span of any component (VEVENT, VTODO, ...) in the
      calendar can overlap the time span of any other component in the
      same calendar.  When applied to an individual object, it indicates
      whether or not any other component's time span can overlap that
      individual component.  If the CS does not allow overlapped
      booking, then the CS is unwilling to allow any overlapped bookings
      within any calendar in the CS.

   Owner -  One or more CUs or UGs that are listed in the "OWNER"
      property in a calendar.  There can be more than one owner.  The "

   Qualified Calendar Identifier (Qualified CalID) -  A CalID in which
      both the scheme and csid of the CAP URI are present.

   Realm -  A collection of calendar user accounts, identified by a
      string.  The name of the Realm is only used in UPNs.  In order to
      avoid namespace conflict, the Realm SHOULD be postfixed with an
      appropriate DNS domain name.  (e.g., the foobar Realm could be
      called foobar.example.com).

   Relative Calendar Identifier (Relative CalID) -  An identifier for an
      individual calendar in a calendar store.  It MUST BE unique within
      a calendar store.  A Relative CalID consists of the "URL path" of
      the "Common Internet Scheme Syntax" portion of a URL, as defined
      by [URI] and [URLGUIDE].

   Session Identity -  A UPN associated with a CAP session.  A session
      gains an identity after successful authentication.  The identity
      is used in combination with VCAR to determine access to data in
      the CS.

Internet-Draft       Calendar Access Protocol (CAP)        November 2002


   User Group (UG) -  A collection of Calendar Users and/or User Groups.
      These groups are expanded by the CS and may reside either locally
      or in an external database or directory.  The group membership may
      be fixed or dynamic over time.

   Username -  A name which denotes a Calendar User within a Realm.
      This is part of a UPN.

   User Principal Name (UPN) -  A unique identifier that denotes a CU or
      a group of CU.  A UPN is a RFC 822 compliant email address, with
      exceptions listed below, and in most cases it is deliverable to
      the CU.  In some cases it is identical to the CU's well known
      email address.  A CU's UPN MUST never be an e-mail address that is
      deliverable to a different person as there is no requirement that
      a person's UPN MUST BE their e-mail address.  A UPN is formatted
      as a user name followed by "@" followed by a Realm in the form of
      a valid, and unique, DNS domain name.  The user name MUST BE
      unique within the Realm.  In  it's simplest form it looks like
      "user@example.com".

      In certain cases a UPN will not be RFC 822 compliant.  When
      anonymous authentication is used, or anonymous authorization is
      being defined, the special UPN "@" will be used.  When
      authentication MUST BE used, but unique identity MUST BE obscured,
      a UPN of the form @DNS-domain-name may be used.  For example,
      "@example.com".

2. Additions to iCalendar

   Several new components, properties, parameters, and value types are
   added in CAP.  This section summarizes those new objects.

   This memo extends the properties that can go into 'calprops' as
   defined in [iCAL] section 4.6 page 51 to allow [iTIP] objects
   transmitted between a CAP aware CUA and the CS to contain the
   "TARGET" and "CMD" properties.  This memo does not address how a CUA
   transmits [iTIP] or [iMIP] objects to non CAP programs.


   calprops   = 2*(

              ; 'prodid' and 'version' are both REQUIRED,
              ; but MUST NOT occur more than once.
              ;
                prodid /version /

              ; These are optional, but MUST NOT occur
              ; more than once.
              ;
                calscale        /
                method          /
                cmd             /

              ; These are optional, and may occur more
              ; than once.
              ;
                target          /
                iana-prop       /
                x-prop


   Another change is that the 'component' part of the 'icalbody' ABNF as
   described in [iCAL] section 4.6 is optional when sending a command as
   shown in the following updated ABNF:

   icalbody = calprops component

             ; If the "VCALENDAR" component contains the "CMD"
             ; component then the 'component' is optional:
             ;
             / calprops     ; Which MUST include a "CMD" property


   In addition a problem exists with the control of "VALARM" components
   and their "TRIGGER" properties.  A CU may wish to set their own alarm



Royer, Babics, Hill, Mansour    Expires May 4, 2003            [Page 12]

Internet-Draft       Calendar Access Protocol (CAP)        November 2002


   (local alarms) on components.  These local alarms are not to be
   forwarded to other CUs, CUAs, or CSs as are the "SEQUENCE" property
   and the "ENABLE" parameter.  So for the protocol between a CUA and a
   CS, the following changes apply to the CAP protocol from [iCAL]
   section "4.6.6" page 67:


     alarmc     = "BEGIN" ":" "VALARM" CRLF
   	       alarm-seq
   	       iana-prop
   	       (audioprop / dispprop / emailprop / procprop)
   	       "END" ":" "VALARM" CRLF

    alarm-seq   = "SEQUENCE" alarmseqparam ":" integer CRLF

   alarmseqparam = *( ";" xparam)
   	      / ";" local-param


   The CUA adds a "SEQUENCE" property to each "VALARM" component as it
   books the component.  This property along with the "LOCAL" and
   "ENABLE" parameters allow the CUA to uniquely identify any VALARM in
   any component.  The CUA should remove those before forwarding to non
   CAP aware CUAs (including [iMIP] CUAs).

   In addition, if a CUA wished to ignore a "TRIGGER" property in a
   "VALARM" component that was supplied to it by the "Organizer", the
   CUA needs a common way to tag that trigger as disabled.  So for the
   protocol between a CUA and a CS, the following is a modification to
   [iCAL] section "4.8.6.3" page 127:


   trigger    = "TRIGGER" 1*(";" enable-param) (trigrel / trigabs)


   Section 7.1 and Section 7.2.

   These additions will be transmitted between a CS and a CAP aware CUA.
   So the "VERSION" value will remain at "2.0" as no existing [iTIP] or
   [iMIP] implementation will be effected.

2.1 New Value Types (summary)

   UPN The UPN value type is text value type restricted to only UPN
      values.  (Section 6.1.2)

   UPN-FILTER Like the UPN value type, but also includes filter rules
      that allow wildcards.  (Section 6.1.3)

Internet-Draft       Calendar Access Protocol (CAP)        November 2002


   CALQUERY The "CAL-QUERY" (Section 6.1.1) value type is a query syntax
      that is used by the CUA to specify the rules that apply to a CAP
      command.  In the case of "SEARCH" command the query language is
      used to fetch objects from the CS.  When used with the "DELETED"
      command, the selected objects are deleted from the CS.  "CAL-
      QUERY" value type can also be used with "MOVE" and "MODIFY"
      commands.


2.1.1 New Parameters (summary)

   ENABLE -

      The "ENABLE" parameter in CAP is used to tag a "TRIGGER" property
      in a component as disabled or enabled.  This is used when a
      scheduling request arrives and the CU wishes to ignore the trigger
      time included.  (Section 7.1).

      Formal Definition: The "ENABLE" parameter is defined by the
      following notation:


   enable-param  = "ENABLE" "=" ("TRUE" / "FALSE")


   LOCAL -

      The "LOCAL" parameter in CAP is used to tag a "SEQUENCE" property
      in a "VALARM" component to signify that a VALARM is local or to be
      distributed.  (Section 7.2).

      For example, when inviting others to an event, the "Organizer's"
      booked "VEVENT" component might contain "VALARM" components, and
      those "VALARM" component might be 'alarm be 5 minutes before the
      meeting'.  However other "Attendees" may have to set their own
      "VALARM" components for the same event (assuming they reply that
      they will be attending).  So, by tagging the "VALARM" component as
      local the CUA MUST never forward those local "VALARM" components
      to other CS's or CUAs.

      The CUA can not simply delete any "VALARM components where the CU
      is not the "Organizer".  If it did, any [iTIP] "COUNTER" method
      would result in the "Organizer" thinking that the "Attendee"
      wished to also counter with removing those "VALARM" components.
      And in addition, any update to an existing component would re-
      create those "VALARM" components in the "Attendees" CS.

      Formal Definition: The "LOCAL" parameter is defined by the

Internet-Draft       Calendar Access Protocol (CAP)        November 2002


      following notation:


   local-param  = "LOCAL" "=" ("TRUE" / "FALSE")



2.1.2 New Properties (summary)

   ALLOW-CONFLICT -  Some entries in a calendar might not be valid if
      other entries were allowed to overlap the same time span.  Renting
      a car for example.  It would not make sense to allow two
      reservations for the same car at the same time.  The "ALLOW-
      CONFLICT" property takes a boolean value.  If FALSE, then
      conflicts are not allowed.  (Section 8.1)

   ATT-COUNTER -  When storing a "METHOD" property with the "COUNTER"
      method, there needs to be a way to remember who sent the COUNTER.
      The ATT-COUNTER property MUST BE added to all "COUNTER" [iTIP]
      components by the CUA before storing in a CS.  (Section 8.2)

   CSID -  Each CS needs its own unique identifier.  The "CSID" property
      is the official unique identifier for the CS.  If the BEEP
      'serverName' attribute was supplied in the BEEP 'start' message,
      then the CSID will be mapped to the virtual host name supplied and
      the host name part of the CSID MUST BE the same as the
      'serverName' value.  This allows one CS implementation to service
      multiple virtual hosts.  CS's are not required to support virtual
      hosting.  If a CS does not support virtual hosting then it must
      ignore the BEEP 'serverName' attribute.  (Section 8.6)

   CALID -  Each calendar within a CS needs to be uniquely identifiable.
      The "CALID" property identifies a unique calendar within a CS.  It
      can be a full CALID or a relative CALID.  (Section 8.3)

   CALMASTER -  The "CALMASTER" property specifies the contact
      information for the CS.  (Section 8.4)

   CARID -  Access rights can be saved and fetched by unique ID - the
      "CARID" property.  (Section 8.5)

   CMD -  The CAP commands, as well as replies are transmitted using the
      "CMD" property.  (Section 10.1)

   DECREED -  Some access rights are not changeable by the CUA.  When
      that is the case, the "DECREED" property value in the "VCAR"
      component will be TRUE.  (Section 8.7)

Internet-Draft       Calendar Access Protocol (CAP)        November 2002


   DEFAULT-CHARSET -  The list of charsets supported by the CS.  The
      first entry MUST BE the default for the CS.  (Section 8.8)

   DEFAULT-LOCALE -  The list of locales supported by the CS.  The first
      entry in the list is the default locale.  (Section 8.9)

   DEFAULT-TZID -  This is the list of known timezones supported.  The
      first entry is the default.  (Section 8.10)

   DEFAULT-VCARS -  A list of the "CARID" properties that will be used
      to create new calendars.  (Section 8.11)

   DENY -  The UPNs listed in the "DENY" property of a "VCAR" component
      will denied access as described in the "VRIGHT" component.
      (Section 8.12)

   EXPAND -  This property tells the CS if the query reply should expand
      components into multiple instances.  The default is FALSE.
      (Section 8.13)

   GRANT -  The UPNs listed in the "GRANT" property of a "VCAR"
      component will allowed access as described in the "VRIGHT"
      component.  (Section 8.14)

   MAXDATE -  The maximum date supported by the CS.  (Section 8.15)

   MINDATE -  The minimum date supported by the CS.  (Section 8.16)

   MULTIPART -  Passed in the capability messages to indicate which MIME
      multipart types the sender supports.  (Section 8.17)

   NAME -  Several storeable components such as "VCAR" and "VQUERY" may
      have the "NAME" property contained in them to describe in various
      locals the purpose of the component.  Components may have multiple
      "NAME" properties each with a unique "LANGUAGE" parameter.
      (Section 8.18)

   OWNER -  Each calendar has at least one "OWNER" property.  (xref
      target="OWNER"/>) Related to the "CAL-OWNERS()" (Section 6.1.1.1)
      query clause.

   PERMISSION -  This property specifies the permission being granted or
      denied.  Examples are the "SEARCH" and "MODIFY" values.  (Section
      8.20)

   QUERY -  Used to hold the CAL-QUERY (Section 8.21) for the component.

   QUERYID -  A unique id for a stored query.  (Section 8.22)

Internet-Draft       Calendar Access Protocol (CAP)        November 2002


   REQUEST-STATUS -  The [iCAL] "REQUEST-STATUS" property is extended to
      include new error numbers.  (Section 8.23)

   RESTRICTION -  In the final check when granting calendar access
      requests, the CS test the results to the value of the
      "RESTRICTION" property in the corresponding "VRIGHT" component to
      determine if the access meets that restriction.  (Section 8.24)

   SCOPE -  The "SCOPE" property is used in "VRIGHT"s component to
      select the subset of data that may be acted upon when checking
      access rights.  (Section 8.25)

   TARGET -  The new "VCALENDAR" component property "TARGET" (Section
      8.26) is used to specify which calendar(s) will be the subject of
      the CAP command.

   TRANSP -  This is a modification the [iCAL] "TRANSP" property and it
      allows more values.  The new values are related to conflict
      control.  (Section 8.27)


2.1.3 New Components (summary)

   VAGENDA -  CAP allows the fetching and storing of the entire contents
      of a calendar.  The "VCALENDAR" component is not sufficient to
      encapsulate all of the needed data that describes a calendar.  The
      "VAGENDA" component is the encapsulating object for an entire
      calendar.  (Section 9.1)

   VCALSTORE -  Each CS contains one or more calendars (VAGENDAs), the
      "VCALSTORE" component is the encapsulating object that can hold
      all of the "VAGENDA" components along with any components and
      properties that are unique to the store level.  (Section 9.2)

   VCAR -  Calendar Access Rights are specified and encapsulated in the
      new iCalendar "VCAR" (Section 9.3) component.  The "VCAR"
      component holds some new properties and at least one "VRIGHT"
      component.

   VRIGHT -  (Section 9.4) This component encapsulates a set of
      instructions to the CS that define the rights or restrictions
      needed.

   VREPLY -  (Section 9.5) This component encapsulates a set of data
      that can consist of an arbitrary amounts of properties and
      components.  Its contents is dependent on the command that was
      issued.

Internet-Draft       Calendar Access Protocol (CAP)        November 2002


   VQUERY -  The search operation makes use of a new component, called
      "VQUERY" (Section 9.6) and a new value type "CAL-QUERY" (Section
      6.1.1).  The "VQUERY" component is used to fetch objects from the
      CS.


2.2 Relationship of RFC-2446 (ITIP) and CAP

   [iTIP] describes scheduling methods which result in indirect
   manipulation of components.  In CAP, the "CREATE" command is used to
   deposit entities into the store.  Other CAP commands such as
   "DELETE", "MODIFY" and "MOVE" command values provide direct
   manipulation of components.  In the CAP calendar store model,
   scheduling messages are conceptually kept separate from other
   components by their state.

   All scheduling operations and are as define in [iTIP].  This memo
   makes no changes to any of the workflow described in [iTIP].  In this
   memo referring to the presence of the "METHOD" property in an object
   is the same as saying an [iTIP] object.

   A CUA may create a "BOOKED" state object by depositing a iCalendar
   object into the store.  This is done by depositing an object that
   does not have a "METHOD" property.  The CS then knows to set the
   state of the object to the "BOOKED" state.  If the object has a
   "METHOD" property then the object is stored in the "UNPROCESSED"
   state.

   If existing "UNPROCESSED" state objects exist in the CS for the same
   UID then a CUA may wish to consolidate the objects in to one "BOOKED"
   state object.  The CUA would fetch the "UNPROCESSED" state objects
   for  that UID and process them in the CUA as described in [iTIP].
   Then if the CUA wished to book the UID, the CUA would issue a
   "CREATE" command to create the new "BOOKED" state object in the CS,
   followed by a "DELETE" command to remove any related old [iTIP]
   objects from the CS.  And it might also involve having the CUA send
   some [iMIP] objects or contacting other CS's and performing CAP
   operations on those CSs.

   The CUA could also decide not to book the object.  In which case the
   "UNPROCESSED" state objects could be removed from the CS or the CUA
   could set those object to the marked for delete state.  The CUA could
   also ignore objects for later processing.

   The marked for delete state is used to keep the object around so that
   the CUA can process duplicate requests automatically.  If a duplicate
   [iTIP] object is deposited into the CS and there exists identical
   marked for delete objects, then a CUA acting on behalf of the "OWNER"

Internet-Draft       Calendar Access Protocol (CAP)        November 2002


   can silently drop those duplicate entries.

   Another purpose for the marked for delete state is so that when a CU
   decides they do not wish to have the object show in their calendar,
   the CUA can book the object; changing the "PARTSTAT" parameter to
   "DECLINED" in the "ATTENDEE" property that corresponds to their UPN.
   Perform an [iTIP] processing such as sending back a decline.  Then
   mark that object as marked for delete.  Their CUA might be
   configurable to automatically drop any updates for that object
   knowing the CU has already declined.

   When synchronizing with multiple CUAs, the marked for delete state
   could be used to inform the synchronization process that an object is
   to be deleted.  How synchronization is done is not specified in this
   memo.

   Several "UNPROCESSED" state entries can be in the CS for the same
   UID.  However once consolidated, then only one object exists in the
   CS and that is the booked object.  The others MUST BE removed, or
   have their state changed to "DELETED".

   There MUST NOT BE more than one "BOOKED" state object in a calendar
   for the same "UID".  The "ADD" method value may create multiple
   objects all in the "BOOKED" state for the same UID, however for the
   purpose of this memo, they are the same object that simply have
   multiple "VCALENDAR" components.

   For example, if you were on vacation, you could have receive a
   "REQUEST" method to attend a meeting and several updates to that
   meeting.  Your CUA would have to issue "SEARCH" commands to find them
   in the CS using CAP, process them, determine what the final state of
   the object from a possible combination of user input and programmed
   logic.  Then the CUA would instruct the CS to create a new booked
   object from the consolidated results.  Finally, the CUA could do a
   "DELETE" command to remove the related "UNPROCESSED" state objects.
   See [iTIP] for details on resolving multiple [iTIP] scheduling
   entries.

3. CAP Design

3.1 System Model

   The system model describes the high level components of a calendar
   system and how they interact with each other.

   CAP is used by a CUA to send commands to and receive responses from a
   CS.

   The CUA prepares a [MIME] encapsulated command, sends it to the CS,
   and receives a [MIME] encapsulated response.  The calendaring related
   information within these messages are represented by iCalendar
   objects.  In addition the "GET-CAPABIBILITY" command can be sent from
   the CS to the CUA.

   There are two distinct protocols in operation to accomplish this
   exchange.  [BEEP] is the transport protocol is used to move these
   encapsulations between a CUA and a CS.  CAP's [BEEP] profile defines
   the application protocol where the content and semantics of the
   messages sent between the CUA and the CS are specified.

3.2 Calendar Store Object Model

   [iCAL] describes components such as events, todos, alarms, and
   timezones.  [CAP] requires additional object infrastructure.  In
   particular,  detailed definitions of the containers for events and
   todos (calendars), access control objects, and a query language.

   The conceptual model for a calendar store is shown below.  The
   calendar store (VCALSTORE - Section 9.2) contains "VCAR"s, "VQUERY"s,
   "VTIMEZONE"s, "VAGENDA"s and calendar store properties.

   Calendars (VAGENDAs) contain "VEVENT"s, "VTODO"s, "VJOURNAL"s,
   "VCAR"s, "VTIMEZONE"s, "VFREEBUSY", "VQUERY"s and calendar
   properties.

   The component "VCALSTORE" is used to denote the a root of the
   calendar store and contains all of the calendars.

   Calendars within a Calendar Store are identified by their unique
   Relative CALID.

3.3 Protocol Model

   CAP uses beep as the transport and authentication protocol.

   The initial charset MUST BE UTF-8 for the session in an unknown
   locale.  If the CS supplied the BEEP 'localize' attribute in the BEEP
   'greeting' then the CUA may tell the CS to switch locales for the
   session by issuing the "SET-LOCALE" CAP command and supplying one of
   the locales supplied by the BEEP 'localize' attribute.  If supplied
   the first locale supplied in the BEEP 'localize' attribute MUST BE
   the default locale of the CS.  The locale is switched only after a
   successful reply.

Internet-Draft       Calendar Access Protocol (CAP)        November 2002


   The "DEFAULT-CHARSET" property of the CS contains the list of
   charsets supported by the CS with the first value being the default
   for new calendars.  If the CUA wishes to switch to one of those
   charsets for the session, the CUA issues the "SET-LOCALE" command.
   The CUA would have to first perform a "GET-CAPABILITY" command on the
   CS to get the list of charsets supported by the CS.  The charset is
   switched only after a successful reply.

   The CUA may switch locales and charsets as needed.  There is no
   requirement that a CS support multiple locales or charsets.

3.3.1 Use of BEEP, MIME and iCalendar

   CAP uses the BEEP application protocol over TCP.  (refer to [BEEP]
   and [BEEPTCP] for more information).  The default port that the
   Calendar Server listens for connections is on user port 1026.

   The BEEP data exchanged in CAP is a iCalendar MIME content that fully
   conforms to [iCAL] iCalendar format.

   This example tells the CS to generate and return 10 UIDs to be used
   by the CUA.  (Note throughout this memo, 'C:' refers to what the CUA
   sends, 'S:' refers to what the CS sends, 'I:' refers to what the
   initiator sends, and 'L:' refers to what the listener sends.  Where
   initiator and responder are used as defined in [BEEP].)


   C: MSG 1 2 . 432 62
   C: Content-Type: text/calendar
   C:
   C: BEGIN:VCALENDAR
   C: VERSION:2.0
   C: PRODID:-//someone's prodid
   C: CMD;ID=unique-per-cua-123;OPTIONS=10:GENERATE-UID
   C: END:VCALENDAR


   NOTE: The following examples will not include the BEEP header and
   footer information.  Only the iCalendar objects that are sent between
   the CUA and CS will be shown as the BEEP payload boundaries are
   independent of CAP.

   The commands listed below are used to manipulate or access the data
   on the calendar store:

   ABORT -  Sent to halt the processing of any command except ABORT.
      (Section 10.1.2)

   CONTINUE -  Sent to continue processing a command that has had its
      specified timeout time reached.  (Section 10.1.3)

   CREATE -  Create a new object on the CS.  This can be implied for
      [iTIP] objects.  Initiated by the CUA only.  (Section 10.1.4)

   SET-LOCALE -  Tell the CS to use any named locale and charset
      supplied.  Initiated by the CUA only.  (Section 10.9)

   DELETE -  Delete objects from the CS.  Initiated by the CUA only.
      Can also be used to mark a object for deletion.  (Section 10.1.5)

   GENERATE-UID -  Generate one or more unique ids.  Initiated by the
      CUA only.  (Section 10.2)

   GET-CAPABILITY - Query the capabilities the other end point of the
      session.  (Section 10.3)

   IDENTIFY -  Set a new identity for the session.  Initiated by the CUA
      only.  (Section 10.4)

   MODIFY -  Modify components.  Initiated by the CUA only.  (Section
      10.5)

   MOVE -  Move components to another container.  Initiated by the CUA
      only.  (Section 10.6)

   REPLY -  When replying to a command, the "CMD" value will be set to
      "REPLY" so that it will not be confused with a new command.
      (Section 10.7)

   SEARCH -  Search for components.  Initiated by the CUA only.
      (Section 10.8)

   TIMEOUT -  Sent when a specified amount of time has lapsed and a
      command has not finished.  (Section 10.10)

4. Security Model

   The BEEP transport performs all session authentication.

4.1 Calendar User and UPNs

   A CU is an entity that can be authenticated.  It is represented in
   CAP as a UPN, which is a key part of access rights.  The UPN
   representation is independent of the authentication mechanism used
   during a particular CUA/CS interaction.  This is because UPNs are
   used within VCARs.  If the UPN were dependent on the authentication
   mechanism, a VCAR could not be consistently evaluated.  A CU may use
   one mechanism while using one CUA but the same CU may use a different
   authentication mechanism when using a different CUA, or while
   connecting from a different location.

   The user may also have multiple UPNs for various purposes.

   Note that the immutability of the user's UPN may be achieved by using
   SASL's authorization identity feature.  (The transmitted
   authorization identity may be different than the identity in the
   client's authentication credentials.) [SASL, section 3].  This also
   permits a CU to authenticate using their own credentials, yet request
   the access privileges of the identity for which they are proxying
   SASL.  Also, the form of authentication identity supplied by a
   service like TLS may not correspond to the UPNs used to express a
   server's access rights, requiring a server specific mapping to be
   done.  The method by which a server determines a UPN, based on the
   authentication credentials supplied by a client, is implementation
   specific.  See [BEEP] for authentication details; [BEEP] relies on
   SASL.

4.1.1 UPNs and Certificates

   When using X.509 certificates for purposes of CAP authentication, the
   UPN should appear in the certificate.  Unfortunately there is no
   single correct guideline for which field should contain the UPN.

   From RFC-2459, section 4.1.2.6 (Subject):

      If subject naming information is present only in the subjectAlt-
      Name extension (e.g., a key bound only to an email address or
      URI), then the subject name MUST be an empty sequence and the
      subjectAltName extension MUST BE critical.

      Implementations of this specification MAY use these comparison
      rules to process unfamiliar attribute types (i.e., for name
      chaining).  This allows implementations to process certificates



Royer, Babics, Hill, Mansour    Expires May 4, 2003            [Page 24]

Internet-Draft       Calendar Access Protocol (CAP)        November 2002


      with unfamiliar attributes in the subject name.

      In addition, legacy implementations exist where an RFC 822 name is
      embedded in the subject distinguished name as an EmailAddress
      attribute.  The attribute value for EmailAddress is of type
      IA5String to permit inclusion of the character '@', which is not
      part of the PrintableString character set.  EmailAddress attribute
      values are not case sensitive (e.g., "fanfeedback@redsox.com" is
      the same as "FANFEEDBACK@REDSOX.COM").

      Conforming implementations generating new certificates with
      electronic mail addresses MUST use the rfc822Name in the subject
      alternative name field (see sec.  4.2.1.7 of [X509CRL]) to
      describe such identities.  Simultaneous inclusion of the
      EmailAddress attribute in the subject distinguished name to
      support legacy implementations is deprecated but permitted.

   Since no single method of including the UPN in the certificate will
   work in all cases, CAP implementations MUST support the ability to
   configure what the mapping will be by the CS administrator.
   Implementations MAY support multiple mapping definitions, for
   example, the UPN may be found in either the subject alternative name
   field, or the UPN may be embedded in the subject distinguished name
   as an EmailAddress attribute.

   Note: If a CS or CUA is validating data received via [iMIP], if the
   "ORGANIZER" or "ATTENDEE" properties said (e.g.) "ATTENDEE;CN=Joe
   Random User:MAILTO:juser@example.com" then the email address should
   be checked against the UPN.  This is so the "ATTENDEE" property
   cannot be changed to something misleading like "ATTENDEE;CN=Joe
   Rictus User:MAILTO:jrictus@example.com" and have it pass validation.
   Note that it is the email addresses that miscompare, the CN
   miscompare is irrelevant.

4.1.2 Anonymous Users and Authentication

   Anonymous access is often desirable.  For example an organization may
   publish calendar information that does not require any access control
   for viewing or login.  Conversely, a user may wish to view
   unrestricted calendar information without revealing their identity.

4.1.3 User Groups

   A User Group is used to represent a collection of CUs or other UGs
   that can be referenced in VCARs.  A UG is represented in CAP as a
   UPN.  The CUA cannot distinguish between a UPN that represents a CU
   or a UG.




Royer, Babics, Hill, Mansour    Expires May 4, 2003            [Page 25]

Internet-Draft       Calendar Access Protocol (CAP)        November 2002


   UGs are expanded as necessary by the CS.  The CS MAY expand a UG
   (including nested UGs) to obtain a list of unique CUs.  Duplicate
   UPNs are filtered during expansion.

   How the UG expansion is maintained across commands is implementation
   specific.  A UG may reference a static list of members, or it may
   represent a dynamic list.  Operations SHOULD recognize changes to UG
   membership.

   CAP does not define commands or methods for managing UGs.

4.2 Access Rights

   Access rights are used to grant or deny access to calendars,
   components, properties, and parameters in a CS to a CU.  CAP defines
   a new component type called a Calendar Access Right (VCAR).
   Specifically, a "VCAR" component grants, or denies, UPNs the right to
   search and write components, properties, and parameters on calendars
   within a CS.

   The "VCAR" component model does not put any restriction on the
   sequence in which the object and access rights are created.  That is,
   an object associated with a particular "VCAR" component might be
   created before or after the actual "VCAR" component is defined.  In
   addition, the "VCAR" and "VEVENT" components might be created in the
   same iCalendar object and passed together in a single object.

   All rights MUST BE denied unless specifically granted.

   If two rights specified in "VCAR" components are in conflict, the
   right that denies access always takes precedence over the right that
   grants access.  Any attempt to create a "VCAR" component that
   conflicts with an immutable "VCAR" components must fail.

4.2.1 Access Control and NOCONFLICT

   The "TRANSP" property can take on values "TRANSPARENT-NOCONFLICT" and
   "OPAQUE-NOCONFLICT" that prohibit other components from overlapping
   it.  This setting overrides access.  The "ALLOW-CONFLICT" CS,
   Calendar or component setting may also prevent overlap, returning an
   error code "6.3".

4.2.2 Calendar Access Right (VCAR)

   Access rights within CAP are specified with the "VCAR" component,
   "RIGHTS" value type and the "GRANT", "DENY" and "CARID" properties.

   Properties within an iCalendar object are unordered.  This also is

Internet-Draft       Calendar Access Protocol (CAP)        November 2002


   the case for the "VCAR" component properties.

4.2.3 Predefined VCARs

   Predefined calendar access CARIDs that MUST BE implemented are:

   CARID:READBUSYTIMEINFO -  Specifies the "GRANT" and "DENY" rules that
      allow UPNs to search "VFREEBUSY" components.  An example
      definition for this VCAR is:




    BEGIN:VCAR
    CARID:READBUSYTIMEINFO
    BEGIN:VRIGHT
    GRANT:*
    PERMISSION:SEARCH
    SCOPE:SELECT * FROM VFREEBUSY
    END:VRIGHT
    END:VCAR


   CARID:REQUESTONLY -  Specifies the "GRANT" and "DENY" rules to UPNs
      other than the owner of the calendar the ability to write new
      objects with the property "METHOD" property set to the "REQUEST"
      value.  This CARID allows the owner to specify which UPNs are
      allowed to make scheduling requests.  An example definition for
      this VCAR is:




    BEGIN:VCAR
    CARID:REQUESTONLY
    BEGIN:VRIGHT
    GRANT:NON CAL-OWNERS()
    PERMISSION:CREATE
    RESTRICTION:SELECT VEVENT FROM VAGENDA WHERE METHOD = 'REQUEST'
    RESTRICTION:SELECT VTODO FROM VAGENDA WHERE METHOD = 'REQUEST'
    RESTRICTION:SELECT VJOURNAL FROM VAGENDA WHERE METHOD = 'REQUEST'
    END:VRIGHT
    END:VCAR


   CARID:UPDATEPARTSTATUS -  Grants to authenticated users the right to
      modify the instances of the "ATTENDEE" property set to one of
      their calendar addresses in any components for any booked



Royer, Babics, Hill, Mansour    Expires May 4, 2003            [Page 27]

Internet-Draft       Calendar Access Protocol (CAP)        November 2002


      component containing a "ATTENDEE" property.  This allows (or
      denies) a CU the ability to update their own participation status
      in a calendar where they might not otherwise have "MODIFY" command
      access.  They are not allowed to change the "ATTENDEE" property
      value.  An example definition for this VCAR is (This example only
      effects the "VEVENT" components):




    BEGIN:VCAR
    CARID:UPDATEPARTSTATUS
    BEGIN:VRIGHT
    GRANT:*
    PERMISSION:MODIFY
    SCOPE:SELECT ATTENDEE FROM VEVENT
     WHERE ATTENDEE = SELF()
     AND ORGANIZER = CURRENT-TARGET()
     AND STATE() = 'BOOKED'
    RESTRICTION:SELECT * FROM VEVENT
     WHERE ATTENDEE = SELF()
    END:VRIGHT
    END:VCAR


   CARID:DEFAULTOWNER -  Grants to any owner the permission they have
      for the target.  An example definition for this VCAR is:




    BEGIN:VCAR
    CARID:DEFAULTOWNER
    BEGIN:VRIGHT
    GRANT:CAL-OWNERS()
    PERMISSION:*
    SCOPE:SELECT * FROM VAGENDA
    END:VRIGHT
    END:VCAR



4.2.4 Decreed VCARs

   A CS MAY choose to implement and allow persistent immutable VCARs
   that may be configured by the CS administrator.  A reply from the CS
   may dynamically create "VCAR" components that are decreed depending
   on the implementation.  To the CUA any "VCAR" component with the



Royer, Babics, Hill, Mansour    Expires May 4, 2003            [Page 28]

Internet-Draft       Calendar Access Protocol (CAP)        November 2002


   "DECREED" property set to "TRUE" can not be changed by the currently
   authenticated UPN, and depending on the implementation and other
   "VCAR" components; might not be able to be changed by any UPN using
   CAP, and never when the CUA gets a "DECREED:TRUE" VCAR.

   When a user attempts to modify or override a decreed "VCAR" component
   rules an error will be returned indicating that the user has
   insufficient authorization to perform the operation.  The reply to
   the CUA MUST BE the same as if a non-decreed VCAR caused the failure.

   The CAP protocol does not define the semantics used to initially
   create a decreed VCAR.  This administrative task is outside the scope
   of the CAP protocol.

   For example; an implementation or a CS administrator may wish to
   define a VCAR that will always allow the calendar owners to have full
   access to their own calendars.

   Decreed "VCAR" components MUST BE readable by the calendar owner in
   standard "VCAR" component format.

4.3 CAP Session Identity

   A BEEP session has an associated set of authentication credentials,
   from which is derived a UPN.  This UPN is the identity of the CAP
   session, and is used to determine access rights for the session.

   The CUA may change the identity of a CAP session by calling the
   "IDENTIFY" command.  The Calendar Server only permits the operation
   if the session's authentication credentials are good for the
   requested identity.  The method of checking this permission is
   implementation dependent, but may be thought of as a mapping from
   authentication credentials to UPNs.  The "IDENTIFY" command allows a
   single set of authentication credentials to choose from multiple
   identities, and allows multiple sets of authentication credentials to
   assume the same identity.

   For anonymous access the identity of the session is "@".  A UPN with
   a null Username and null Realm is anonymous.  A UPN with a null
   Username, but non-null Realm, such as "@foo.com" may be used to mean
   any identity from that Realm, which is useful to grant access rights
   to all users in a given Realm.  A UPN with a non-null Username and
   null Realm, such as "bob@" could be a security risk and MUST NOT be
   used.

   Since the UPN includes Realm information it may be used to govern
   calendar store access rights across Realms.  However, governing
   access rights across Realms is only useful if login access is

   available.  This could be done through a trusted server relationship
   or a temporary account.  Note that trusted server relationships are
   outside the scope of [CAP].

   The "IDENTIFY" command also provides for a weak group implementation.
   By allowing multiple sets of authentication credentials belonging to
   different users to identify as the same UPN, that UPN essentially
   identifies a group of people, and may be used for group calendar
   ownership, or the granting of access rights to a group.

5. CAP URL and Calendar Address

   The CAP URL scheme is used to designate calendar stores and calendars
   accessible using the CAP protocol.

   The CAP URL scheme conform to the generic URL syntax, defined in RFC
   2396, and follows the Guidelines for URL Schemes, set forth in RFC
   2718.

   A CAP URL begins with the protocol prefix "cap" and is defined by the
   following grammar.


   capurl   = "cap://" csid [ "/" relcalid ]
   csid     = hostport   ; As defined in Section 3.2.2 of RFC 2396
   relcalid = *uric      ; As defined in Section 2 of RFC 2396


   A 'relcalid' is an identifier that uniquely identifies a calendar on
   a particular calendar store.  There is no implied structure in a
   Relative CALID.  It may refer to the calendar of a user or of a
   resource such as a conference room.  It MUST BE unique within the
   calendar store.

   Examples:


   cap://cal.example.com
   cap://cal.example.com/Company/Holidays
   cap://cal.example.com/abcd1234Usr


   Relative CAP URLs are permitted and are resolved according to the
   rules defined in Section 5 of RFC 2396.

   Examples of valid relative CAP URLs:


   opqaueXzz123String
   UserName/Personal


   A Calendar addresses can be described as qualified or relative CAP
   URLs.

   For a user currently authenticated to the CS on cal.example.com,
   these two example calendar addresses refer to the same calendar:

6. New Value Types

   The following sections contains new components, properties,
   parameters, and value definitions.

   The purpose of these is to extend the iCalendar objects in a
   compatible way so that existing iCalendar "VERSION" property "2.0"
   value parsers can still parse the objects without modification.

6.1 Property Value Data Types

6.1.1 CAL-QUERY Value Type

   Subject: Registration of text/calendar MIME value type CAL-QUERY

   Value Name: CAL-QUERY

   Value Type Purpose: This value type is used to identify values and
   contains query statements targeted at locating those values.

   This is based on [SQL92] and [SQLCOM].

   1.  For the purpose of a query, all components should be handled as
       tables, and the properties of those components, should be handled
       as columns.

   2.  All VAGENDAs and CS's look like tables for the purpose of a
       QUERY.  And all of their properties look like columns in those
       tables.

   3.  You CAN NOT do any cross component-type joins.  And that means
       you can ONLY have one component, OR one "VAGENDA" component OR
       one "VCALSTORE" component in the "FROM" clause.

   4.  Everything in the "SELECT" clause and "WHERE" clauses in MUST BE
       from the same component type, or "VAGENDA" component OR
       "VCALSTORE" component in the "FROM" clause.

   5.  When multiple "QUERY" properties are supplied in a single
       "VQUERY" component, the results returned are the same as the
       results returned for multiple "VQUERY" components having each a
       single "QUERY" property and the results are return in the same
       order as the "VQUERY" properties were specified in the original
       command.

   6.  The '.' is used to separate the table name (component) and column
       name (property or component) when selecting a property that is
       contained inside of a component that is targeted in the TARGET

       property.

   7.  A contained component without a '.' is not the same as
       "component-name.*".  If given as "component-name" (no dot) the
       encapsulating BEGIN/END statement will be supplied for
       "component-name".:

   In this example the '.' is used to separate the "TRIGGER" property
   from its contained component (VALARM).  Which is contained in any
   "VEVENT" component in the selected "TARGET" property value (a
   relcalid).  All "TRIGGER" properties in any "VEVENT" component in
   relcalid would be returned.



   TARGET:relcalid
   QUERY:SELECT VALARM.TRIGGER FROM VEVENT




   SELECT VALARM FROM VEVENT WHERE UID = "123"

   This return one BEGIN/END "VALARM" component for each
   "VALARM" component in the matching "VEVENT" component.
   As there is no '.' (dot) in the VALARM after the SELECT above:

   BEGIN:VALARM
   TRIGGER;RELATED=END:PT5M
   REPEAT:4
   ...
   END:VALARM
   BEGIN:VALARM
   TRIGGER;RELATED=START:PT5M
   DURATION:PT10M
   ...
   END:VALARM
   ...
   ...


   If provided as "component-name.*", then only the properties and any
   contained components will be returned:

   SELECT VALARM.* FROM VEVENT WHERE UID = "123"

   Will return all of the properties in each "VALARM" component
   in the matching "VEVENT" component:

   TRIGGER;RELATED=END:PT5M
   REPEAT:4
   ...
   TRIGGER;RELATED=START:PT5M
   DURATION:PT10M

       (b) SELECT VALARM FROM VEVENT

       (c) SELECT VALARM.* FROM VEVENT

       (d) SELECT * FROM VEVENT

       (e) SELECT * FROM VEVENT WHERE
            VALARM.TRIGGER < '20020201T000000Z'
            AND VALARM.TRIGGER > '20020101T000000Z'

   Note:
       (a) Selects all instances of <a-property-name>
   	from all "VEVENT" components.

       (b) and (c) Select all "VALARM" components from all
   	"VEVENT" components. (b) would return then in
   	BEGIN/END VALARM tags. (c) would return all
   	of the properties without BEGIN/END VALARM tags.

       (d) Selects every property and every component
   	that is in any "VEVENT" component.

       (e) Selects all properties and all contained
   	components in all "VEVENT" components that have a "VALARM"
   	component with a "TRIGGER" property value between
   	the provided dates and times.

   NOT VALID:

       (f) SELECT VEVENT.VALARM.TRIGGER FROM VEVENT

6.1.1.1 [NOT] CAL-OWNERS()

   This function returns the list of "OWNER" properties for the named
   calendar when used in the "SELECT" clause.

   If called as 'CAL-OWNERS()', it is equivalent to the comma separated

   list of all of the owners of the calendar that match the provided
   "TARGET" property value.  If the target is a "VCALSTORE", it returns
   the "CALMASTER" property.

   If called as 'CAL-OWNERS(cal-address)', then it is the equivalent to
   the comma separated list of owners for the named calendar id.  If
   'cal-address' is a CS, it returns the "CALMASTER" property.

   If used in the in the "WHERE" clause it then returns true if the
   currently authenticated UPN is an owner of the currently selected
   object matched in the provided "TARGET" property.  Used in a CAL-
   QUERY "WHERE" clause and in the UPN-FILTER.

6.1.1.2 CURRENT-TARGET()

   Is equivalent to the value of the "TARGET" property in the current
   command.  Used in a CAL-QUERY "WHERE" clause.

6.1.1.3 PARAM()

   Used in a CAL-QUERY.  Returns the value of the named parameter from
   the named property.  If there are multiple properties in the object,
   then PARAM() returns a comma separated list of parameter values.  If
   needed each value can be quoted or contain backslash escaped
   contents.

   When used in a "SELECT" clause, it returns the entire property and
   all of that propertiies parameters (the result is not limited to the
   supplied parameter).  If the property does not contain the named
   parameter, then the property is not returned (It could however be
   returned as a result of another "SELECT" clause value.) If multiple
   properties of the supplied name have the named parameter, all
   properties with that named parameter are returned.

   When used in the "WHERE" clause, a match is true when the parameter
   value is "IN" or "LIKE" compare clause according to the supplied
   WHERE values.  If multiple named properties contain the named
   parameter, then each parameter value is compared to the condition and
   if any match, then the results would be true for that condition the
   same as if only one had existed.

6.1.1.4 SELF()

   Used in a CAL-QUERY "WHERE" clause.  Returns the UPN of the currently
   authenticated UPN.

6.1.1.5 STATE()

   Returns one of three values, 'BOOKED', 'UNPROCESSED', or 'DELETED'
   depending on the state of the object.  Used in a CAL-QUERY "WHERE"
   clause.

6.1.1.6 Ordering of Results

   Sorting will take place in the order the columns are supplied in the
   QUERY command.  The CS MUST sort at least the first column.  The CS
   MAY sort additional columns.

   Float and integer values MUST BE sorted by their numeric value.  This
   means the result of a sort on an integer value type will be:


       1, 2, 100, 1000

   and not

       1, 100, 1000, 2


   This means the result of a sort on an float value type will be:


       1.1, 2.23, 100.332, 1000.12

   and not

       1.1, 100.332, 1000.12, 2.23


   Date and date time values will be sorted by their equivalent value in
   UTC.  No matter what the returned time zone in the result set
   returns.  This is so that if multiple components are returned each in
   a unique time zone, the results will be sorted in UTC.  This does not
   mean the values MUST BE converted to UTC in the data returned to the
   CUA.  It means the CS must do the sort in UTC.

   All other values are sorted according to the locale sorting order as
   specified in the command.  Or the calendar locale if known, or the CS
   locale if the calendar does not have any locale set.  And the locale
   to use for the sort is determined in that order.

6.1.1.7 Date sorting order

   If the cap-cols is only "*" and nothing else and the result set has a

Internet-Draft       Calendar Access Protocol (CAP)        November 2002


   DTSTART, then:

   If EXPAND=FALSE sorting will be by the "DTSTART" property value
   ascending as if it were in UTC.

   If EXPAND=TRUE sorting will be by the "RECURRENCE-ID" property value
   ascending as if it were in UTC.

   If one or more "DTSTART" or "RECURRENCE-ID" property values in
   multiple components have exactly the same value, the order for those
   matching components is unspecified.

   If the selected component(s) do not contain a "DTSTART" property or a
   "RECURRENCE-ID" property, then the order is unspecified.

   If an instance does not have a "RECURRENCE-ID" property and the query
   compares "RECURRENCE-ID" properties (comparing a RECURRENCE-ID to the
   date or date/time of a single instance object), then the CS MUST
   compare the "DTSTART" property value as if it were a "RECURRENCE-ID"
   even for single instance objects that do not contain a "RECURRENCE-
   ID" property.

   A component with a DATE and no TIME value is returned before objects
   with both a DATE and TIME value when the dates of those two (or more)
   objects are the same, sorted by date.

6.1.1.8 Use of single quote

   All literal values are surrounded by single quotes ('), not double
   quotes ("), and not without any quotes.  If the value contains quotes
   or any other ESCAPED-CHAR, they MUST BE backslash escaped as
   described in section "4.3.11 Text" of RFC2445.  Any "LIKE" clause
   wildcard characters that are part of any literal data that is
   preceded by a "LIKE" clause and is not intended to mean wildcard
   search, MUST BE escaped as described in note (7) below.

6.1.1.9 Comparing DATE and DATE-TIME values

   When comparing "DATE-TIME" values to "DATE" values and when comparing
   "DATE" values to "DATE-TIME" values, the result will be true if the
   "DATE" value is on the same day as the "DATE-TIME" value.  And they
   are compared in UTC no matter what time zone the data may actual have
   been stored in.

   (in UTC-0)          (in UTC-7)


   When the "DATE" value or "DATE-TIME" value is not associated with a
   time zone, then the CS will compare the value assuming that the no
   time zone values are in the calendars default time zone.

   When comparing "DATE" values and "DATE-TIME" values with the "LIKE"
   clause the comparison will be done as if the value is a RFC2445 DATE
   or DATE-TIME string value.


   LIKE '2002%' will match anything in the year 2002.

   LIKE '200201%' will match anything in January 2002.

   LIKE '%T000000' will match anything at midnight.

   LIKE '____01__T%' will match anything for any year or
   	      time that is in January.
   	      (Four '_', '01', two '_' 'T%').


   Using a "LIKE" clause value of "%00%, would return any value that
   contained two consecutive zeros.

   All comparisons will be done in UTC.

6.1.1.10 DTEND and DURATION

   When a "QUERY" property value contains a "DTEND" value, then the CS
   MUST also evaluate any existing "DURATION" property value and
   determine if it has an effective end time that matches the "QUERY"
   property supplied "DTEND" value or any range of values supplied by
   the "QUERY" property.

   When a "QUERY" property contains a "DURATION" value, then the CS MUST
   also evaluate any existing "DTEND" property values and determine if
   they have an effective duration that matches the "QUERY" property

   value supplied "DURATION" value or any range of values supplied by
   the "QUERY" property.

   As "DTEND" value is the first time that is excluded from a components
   time range, any "DURATION" value supplied by the "QUERY" poperty
   value that is exactly one second less than the "DTEND" property value
   MUST match the QUERY.  And if the "DURATION" property value ends
   exactly at the computed DTEND it MUST NOT match.

   Any "DTEND" value supplied by the "QUERY" property that is exactly
   one second more than an end time computed from a DURATION MUST match
   the QUERY.  Any end time that is computed from a DURATION that
   exactly matches the supplied DTEND MUST NOT match.

   Given a meeting room reserved with a component that contains (date-
   time-example-1):

        AND DURATION = 'P59M59S'


   MUST match both (date-time-example-1) and (date-time-example-2)

6.1.1.11 [NOT] LIKE

   The pattern matching characters are the '%' that matches zero or more
   characters, and '_' that matches exactly one character (where
   character does not always mean octet).

   "LIKE" clause pattern matches always cover the entire string.  To
   match a pattern anywhere within a string, the pattern must start and
   end with a percent sign.

   To match a '%' or '_' in the data and not have it interpreted as a
   wildcard character, they MUST BE backslash escaped.  That is to
   search for a '%' or '_' in the string:


     LIKE '%\%%'    Matches any string with a '%' in it.
     LIKE '%\_%'    Matches any string with a '_' in it.


   Strings compared using the "LIKE" clause MUST BE performed using case
   in-sensitive comparisons when the locale allows.  (Example: in US-
   ASCII the compare assumes 'a' = 'A').

   If the "LIKE" clause is preceded by 'NOT' then there is a match when
   the string compare fails.

   Some property values (such as the 'recur' value type), contain commas
   and are not multi valued.  The CS must understand the objects being
   compared and understand how to determine how any multi valued or
   multi instances properties or parameter values are separated, quoted,
   and backslash escaped and perform the comparisons as if each value
   existed by itself and not quoted or backslash escaped when comparing
   using the IN element.

   See related examples in Section 6.1.1.13

6.1.1.12 Empty vs. NULL

   When used in a CAL-QUERY value, "NULL" means that the property or
   parameter is not present in the object.

   If the property (or parameter) exists, but has no value then "NULL"
   MUST NOT match.

   If the property (or parameter) exists, but has no value then it
   matches the empty string '' (quote quote).

6.1.1.13 [NOT] IN

   This is similar to the "LIKE" clause, except it does value matching
   and not string comparison matches.

   Some iCalendar objects can be multi instance and multi valued.  The
   "IN" clause will return a match if the literal value supplied as part
   of the "IN" clause is contained in the value of any instance of the
   named property or parameter, or is in any of the multiple values in
   the named property or parameter.  Unlike the "LIKE" clause, the '%'
   and '_' matching characters are not used with the "IN" clause and
   have no special meaning.

          parameter LIKE ','            would match (e) only.


   Some property values (such as the "RECUR" value type), contain commas
   and are not multi valued.  The CS must understand the objects being
   compared and understand how to determine how any multi valued or
   multi instances properties or parameter values are separated, quoted,
   and backslash escaped and perform the comparisons as if each value
   existed by itself and not quoted or backslash escaped when comparing
   using the IN element.

   If the "IN" clause is preceded by 'NOT' then there is a match when
   the value does not exist in the property or parameter value.

6.1.1.14 DATE-TIME and TIME values in a WHEN clause

   All "DATE-TIME" and "TIME" literal values supplied in a "WHEN" clause
   MUST BE terminated with 'Z'.  That means that the CUA MUST supply the
   values in UTC.

   Valid:

   WHERE alarm.TRIGGER < '20020201T000000Z'
   AND alarm.TRIGGER > '20020101T000000Z'


   Not valid and it is a syntax error and the CS MUST reject the QUERY.


   WHERE alarm.TRIGGER < '20020201T000000'
   AND alarm.TRIGGER > '20020101T000000'



6.1.1.15 Multiple contained components

   All comparisons MUST BE done from the same instance of a contained
   component or property and repeated for each instance.  As in the
   following example that uses a "VALARM" component contained in a
   "VEVENT" component .  If any instance of a "VALARM" component in any
   "VEVENT" component  matches the query and the rest of the query is
   satisfied, then the "UID", "SUMMARY", and "DESCRIPTION" properties
   from all "VEVENT" components will be returned.  If there were two
   "VALARM" components in a "VEVENT" component, then both "VALARM"
   components are tested and in this example only when the "VEVENT"
   component state is booked:



   BEGIN:VQUERY
   EXPAND:TRUE
   QUERY:SELECT UID,SUMMARY,DESCRIPTION FROM VEVENT
   WHERE VALARM.TRIGGER >= '20000101T030405Z'
   AND VALARM.TRIGGER <= '20001231T235959Z'
   AND STATE() = 'BOOKED'
   END:VQUERY



6.1.1.16 Example, Query by UID

   The following example would match the entire content of a "VEVENT" or
   "VTODO" component with the "UID" property equal to "uid123" and not
   expand any multiple instances of the component.  If the CUA does not
   know  if "uid123" was a "VEVENT", "VTODO", "VJOURNAL", or any other
   component, then all components that the CUA supports MUST BE supplied
   in a QUERY property.  This example assumes the CUA is only interested
   in "VTODO" and "VEVENT" components.

   If the results were empty it could also mean that "uid123" was a
   property in a component other than a VTODO or VEVENT.


   BEGIN:VQUERY
   QUERY:SELECT * FROM VTODO WHERE UID = 'uid123'
   QUERY:SELECT * FROM VEVENT WHERE UID = 'uid123'
   END:VQUERY



6.1.1.17 Query by Date-Time range

   This query selects the entire content of every booked "VEVENT"
   component that has an instance greater than or equal to July 1st,
   2000 00:00:00 UTC and less than or equal to July 31st, 2000 23:59:59
   UTC.  This includes single instance "VEVENT" components that do no
   explicitly contain a "RECURRENCE-ID" property.


   BEGIN:VQUERY
   EXPAND:TRUE
   QUERY:SELECT * FROM VEVENT
   WHERE RECURRENCE-ID >= '20000801T000000Z'
   AND RECURRENCE-ID <= '20000831T235959Z'
   AND STATE() = 'BOOKED'
   END:VQUERY



6.1.1.18 Query for all Unprocessed Entries

   The following example selects the entire contents of all non-booked
   "VTODO" and "VEVENT" components in the "UNPROCESSED" state.  The
   default for the "EXPAND" property is FALSE, so the recurrence rules
   will not be expanded.


   BEGIN:VQUERY
   QUERYID:Fetch VEVENT and VTODO iTIP components
   QUERY:SELECT * FROM VEVENT WHERE
   STATE() = 'UNPROCESSED'
   QUERY:SELECT * FROM VTODO WHERE
   STATE() = 'UNPROCESSED'
   END:VQUERY


   The following example fetches all "VEVENT" and "VTODO" components in

   the "BOOKED" state.


   BEGIN:VQUERY
   QUERYID:Fetch All Booked VEVENT and VTODO components
   QUERY:SELECT * FROM VEVENT WHERE STATE() = 'BOOKED'
   QUERY:SELECT * FROM VTODO WHERE STATE() = 'BOOKED'
   END:VQUERY


   The following fetches the "UID" property for all "VEVENT" and
   "fVTODO" components that have been marked for delete.


   BEGIN:VQUERY
   QUERYID:Fetch UIDs of marked for delete VEVENTs and VTODOs
   QUERY:SELECT UID FROM VEVENT WHERE STATE() = 'DELETE'
   QUERY:SELECT UID FROM VTODO WHERE STATE() = 'DELETE'
   END:VQUERY


   In the examples above they were bunched into groups of similar
   queries.  They could be performed all at once by having all of the
   "QUERY" properties in one BEGIN/END "VQUERY" component.  The replies
   MUST BE in the same order as the supplied "QUERY" properties.

6.1.1.19 Query with Subset of Properties by Date/Time

   In this example only the named properties will be selected and all
   booked and non-booked components will be selected that have a
   "DTSTART" value from February 1st to February 10th 2000 (in UTC).


   BEGIN:VQUERY
   QUERY:SELECT UID,DTSTART,DESCRIPTION,SUMMARY FROM VEVENT
   WHERE DTSTART >= '20000201T000000Z'
   AND DTSTART <= '20000210T235959Z'
   END:VQUERY



6.1.1.20 Query with Components and Alarms In A Range

   This example fetches all booked "VEVENT" components with an alarm
   that triggers within the specified time range.  In this case only the
   "UID", "SUMMARY", and "DESCRIPTION" properties will be selected for
   all booked "VEVENTS" components that have an alarm between the two
   date-times supplied.

7. New Parameters

7.1 ENABLE Parameter

   Parameter Name: ENABLE

   Purpose: This parameter indicates whether or not the "TRIGGER"
   property in a "VALARM" component should be ignored.

   Value Type: BOOLEAN

   Conformance: This property can be specified in the "TRIGGER"
   properties.

   Description: When a non owner sends an [iTIP] "REQUEST" to a calendar
   that object might contain a "VALARM" component.  The owner may wish
   to have local control over their own CUA and when or how alarms are
   triggered.

   A CUA may add the "ENABLE" parameter to any "TRIGGER" property before
   booking the component.  If the "ENABLE" parameter is set to "FALSE",
   then the alarm will be ignored by the CUA.  If set to "TRUE", or if
   the "ENABLE" property is not in the "TRIGGER" property, the alarm is
   enabled.  The CUA should remove the "ENABLE" parameter before
   forwarding the component to a non-cap CUA.

   Formal Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:


   enable-param       = "ENABLE" "=" boolean


   Example: The following is an example of this property for a "VAGENDA"
   component:


   TRIGGER;ENABLE=FALSE;RELATED=END:PT5M

   Conformance: This parameter can be specified in the "SEQUENCE"
   properties in a "VALARM" component.

   Description: When a non owner sends an [iTIP] "REQUEST" to a calendar
   that object might contain a "VALARM" component.  The owner may wish
   to have local control over their own CUA and when or how alarms are
   triggered.

   A CUA may add the "LOCAL" parameter to the "SEQUENCE" property before
   booking the component.  If the "LOCAL" parameter is set to "FALSE",
   then the alarm MUST NOT be forwarded to any non organizer calendar.
   If set to "TRUE", or of the "LOCAL" property is not in the "SEQUENCE"
   property, the alarm is global.  The CUA should remove the "LOCAL"
   parameter before forwarding the component to a non-cap CUA and to non
   organizer calendars.

   Formal Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

   following table and ABNF notation.  The creation of a "VCALSTORE"
   component is an administrative task and not part of the CAP protocol.

   The following is a summary of the properties of the calendar store.


   Name           Read  Description
   	  Only
   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   ALLOW-CONFLICT  Y    This boolean value indicates Whether or not
                        the VCALSTORE supports object conflicts. That
                        is, whether or not any of the objects in any
                        calendar can overlap. If FALSE, then the CS
                        does not allow conflicts for any object in any
                        calendar. How this property is set in the
                        VCALSTORE is an administrative or implementation
                        specific issue and is not covered in CAP.

   CALSCALE        Y    A comma separated list of CALSCALEs supported
                        by this CS. All Calendar CALSCALE properties
                        MUST BE from this list. MUST contain at least
                        "GREGORIAN". The default for newly created
                        calendars is the first entry. How this property
                        is set in the VCALSTORE is an administrative
                        or implementation specific issue and is not
                        covered in CAP.

   CALMASTER       N    URL of contact address for person responsible.
                        SHOULD BE mailto URL. MUST BE an IANA registered
                        URL scheme. This is to allow external entities a
                        contact point for the CS.

   CHILDREN        N    A multi instance property that lists all of the
                        calendars in this VCALSTORE. The values are the
                        relative CSID for each calendar.

   CREATED         Y    The timestamp of the CS creation time.

   CSID            Y    The CSID of this calendar store. MUST NOT be
                        empty.  How this property is set in the VCALSTORE
                        is an administrative or implementation specific
                        issue and is not covered in CAP.

   DEFAULT-CHARSET Y    A comma separated lists of charsets supported
                        by this CS. MUST contain at least "UTF-8".
                        The first is the default for all newly created
                        calendars. How this property is set in the
                        VCALSTORE is an administrative or implementation

                        specific issue and is not covered in CAP.

   DEFAULT-LOCALE  Y    A comma separated list of locales supported
                        by this CS. MUST contain at least one entry.
                        ("en_US" for example). The first is the default
                        for  all newly created calendars. There is
                        no default for this property in the VCALSTORE.

   DEFAULT-VCARS   N    A multivalued property containing the CARID's for
                        the default VCARs for newly created top level
                        calendars. It MUST include at a minimum
                        READBUSYTIMEINFO, REQUESTONLY, UPDATEPARTSTATUS,
                        and DEFAULTOWNER.

   DEFAULT-TZID    N    A comma separated list of TZID's supported by
                        the CS. These will be known across all calendars.
                        Calendar entries take precedence if they exist
                        in both the CS and calendar. It MUST include at least
                        UTC. First entry is default for all newly created
                        calendars.

   LAST-MODIFIED   Y    The timestamp when the Properties of the CS
                        were last updated or calendars were created
                        or deleted.

   NAME            N    Optional, multi instance display names for
                        this CS. It is a localizable string. May
                        be multiple instance and no two instances may
                        have the same LANG parameter. All instances
                        MUST have the LANG parameter in the VCALSTORE.

   RELATED-TO      N    An optional multi-instance property indicating
                        any relationship to other CSs and those CALIDs.

9.3 VCAR Component

   Component Name: VCAR

   Purpose: Provide a grouping of calendar access rights.

   Formal Definition: A "VCAR" component is defined by the following
   notation:

   carc    =  "BEGIN" ":" "VCAR" CRLF
   	carprop 1*rightc
   	"END" ":" "VCAR" CRLF

   carprop = 1*(

        ; 'carid' is REQUIRED,
        ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

        carid /

        ; the following are OPTIONAL,
        ; and MAY occur more than once

        name / x-prop / iana-prop
        )


   Description: A "VCAR" component is a grouping of properties, and
   "VRIGHT" components, that represents access rights granted or denied
   to UPNs.

   The "CARID" property specifies the local identifier for the "VCAR"
   component.  The "NAME" property specifies a localizable display name.

   Example: In the following example, the UPN "foo@example.com" is given
   search access to the "DTSTART" and "DTEND" VEVENT properties.  No
   other access is specified:


   BEGIN:VCAR
   CARID:View Start and End Times
   NAME:View Start and End Times
   BEGIN:VRIGHT
   GRANT:foo@example.com
   PERMISSION:SEARCH
   SCOPE:SELECT DTSTART,DTEND FROM VEVENT
   END:VRIGHT
   END:VCAR


   In this example, all UPNs are given search access to "DTSTART" and
   "DTEND" properties of VEVENT components.  "All CUs and UGs" are
   specified by the UPN value "*".  Note that this enumerated UPN value
   is not in quotes:

Internet-Draft       Calendar Access Protocol (CAP)        November 2002


   BEGIN:VCAR
   CARID:ViewStartEnd2
   NAME:View Start and End Times 2
   BEGIN:VRIGHT
   GRANT:*
   PERMISSION:SEARCH
   SCOPE:SELECT DTSTART,DTEND FROM VEVENT
   END:VRIGHT
   END:VCAR


   In these examples, full calendar access rights are given to the CAL-
   OWNERS(), and a hypothetical administrator is given access rights to
   specify calendar access rights.  If no other rights are specified,
   only these two UPNs can specify calendar access rights:


   BEGIN:VCAR
   CARID:some-id-3
   NAME:Only OWNER or ADMIN Settable VCARs
   BEGIN:VRIGHT
   GRANT:CAL-OWNERS()
   PERMISSION:*
   SCOPE:SELECT * FROM VAGENDA
   END:VRIGHT
   BEGIN:VRIGHT
   GRANT:cal-admin@example.com
   PERMISSION:*
   SCOPE:SELECT * FROM VCAR
   RESTRICTION:SELECT * FROM VCAR
   END:VRIGHT
   END:VCAR


   In this example, rights to write, search, modify or delete calendar
   access rights are denied to all UPNs.  This example would disable
   providing different access rights to the calendar store or calendar.
   This calendar access right should be specified with great care, as it
   removes the ability to change calendar access; even for the owner or
   administrator.  It could be used by small devices that do not support
   the changing of any VCAR:

   NAME:No CAR At All
   BEGIN:VRIGHT
   DENY:*
   PERMISSION:*
   SCOPE:SELECT * FROM VCAR
   END:VRIGHT
   END:VCAR



9.4 VRIGHT Component

   Component Name: "VRIGHT"

   Purpose: Provide a grouping of properties that describe an access
   right (granted or denied).

   Formal Definition: A "VRIGHT" component is defined by the following
   notation:


   rightc    =  "BEGIN" ":" "VRIGHT" CRLF
   	  rightprop
   	  "END" ":" "VRIGHT" CRLF

   rightprop = 2*(

             ; either 'grant' or 'deny' MUST
             ; occur at least once
             ; and MAY occur more than once

              grant / deny /

             ; 'permission' MUST occur at least once
             ; and MAY occur more than once

              permission /

             ; the following are optional,
             ; and MAY occur more than once

              scope / restriction / x-prop / iana-prop

          )

Internet-Draft       Calendar Access Protocol (CAP)        November 2002


   Description: A "VRIGHT" component is a grouping of calendar access
   right properties.

   The "GRANT" property specifies the UPN that is being granted access.
   The "DENY" property specifies the UPN is being denied access.  The
   "PERMISSION" property specifies the actual permission being set.  The
   "SCOPE" property identifies the calendar store properties, calendar
   properties, components, or properties to which the access right
   applies.  The "RESTRICTION" property specifies restriction on the
   value that may take calendar store properties, calendar properties,
   calendar components, and properties after a "CREATE" or "MODIFY"
   command.  Values MUST match all the instances of the "RESTRICTION"
   property to be valid.

9.5 VREPLY Component

   Component Name: "VREPLY"

   Purpose: Provide a grouping of arbitrary properties and components
   that are the data set result from an issued command.

   Formal Definition: A "VREPLY" component is defined by the following
   notation:


   replyc           =  "BEGIN" ":" "VREPLY" CRLF
                       any-prop-or-comp
                       "END" ":" "VREPLY" CRLF

   any-prop-or-comp = ; Zero or more iana or experimental
                      ; properties and components, in any order.


   Description: Provide a grouping of arbitrary properties and
   components that are the data set result from an issued command.

   A query can return a predictable set of arbitrary properties and
   components.  This component is used by query and other commands to
   return data that does not fit into any other component.  It may
   contain any valid property or component, even if they are not
   registered.

9.6 VQUERY Component

   Component Name: VQUERY

   Purpose: A component to specify what is to be fetched from a CS.

Internet-Draft       Calendar Access Protocol (CAP)        November 2002


   Formal Definition: A "VQUERY" component is defined by the following
   notation:


   queryc    =  "BEGIN" ":" "VQUERY" CRLF
                queryprop
                "END" ":" "VCAR" CRLF

   queryprop = 1*(

             ; 'queryid' is OPTIONAL but MUST NOT occur
             ; more than once. If the "TARGET" property
             ; is supplied then the "QUERYID" property
             ; MUST BE supplied.
             ;
              queryid / target

             ; the following are OPTIONAL, and MAY occur
             ; more than once
             ;
             / name / x-prop / iana-prop

             ; the following MUST occur at least once.
             ;
             / query

           )


   Description: A "VQUERY" contains properties that specify which
   properties and components the CS is requested to return during a
   SEARCH command.

   The "QUERYID" property specifies the local identifier for a stored
   "VQUERY" component.  The "NAME" property specifies a localizable
   display name of a stored "VQUERY" component.  Normally "NAME" and
   "QUERYID" properties are used when looking for a correct stored
   "VQUERY" component, or when storing a "VQUERY" component.

   For a search, if the "TARGET" property is supplied in a "VQUERY"
   component, then the CS is to search for the query in the calid
   supplied by the "TARGET" property value.

   For a create the "TARGET" property MUST NOT be supplied as the
   destination container is already supplied in the "TARGET" property of
   the "VCALENDAR" component.

   For examples, see Section 6.1.1.

10. Commands and Responses

   CAP commands and responses are described in this section.

10.1 CAP Commands (CMD)

   All commands are send using the CMD property.

   Property Name: CMD

   Purpose: The property defines the command to be sent.

   Value Type: TEXT

   Property Parameters: Non-standard, id, localize, latency, action or
   options.

   Conformance: This property is the method used to specify the commands
   to a CS and can exist in any object sent to the CS.

   Description: All of the command to the CS are supplied in this
   property.  The "OPTIONS" parameter is overloaded and its meaning is
   dependent on the CMD value supplied.

   Formal Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:


   cmd              = "CMD" (
                    / abort-cmd

                      ; CMD.

   option-value     = paramtext


   Calendaring commands allow a CUA to directly manipulate a calendar.

   Calendar access rights can be granted or denied for any commands.

10.1.1 Bounded Latency

   A CAP command can have an associated maximum latency time by
   specifying the "LATENCY" parameter.  If the command is unable to be
   completed in the specified amount of time (as specified by the
   "LATENCY" parameter value), then a "TIMEOUT" command MUST BE sent on
   the same channel to which there MUST BE a an "ABORT" or a "CONTINUE"
   command reply.  If the CUA initiated the original command, then the
   CS would issue the "TIMEOUT" command and the CUA would then have to
   issue an "ABORT" or "CONTINUE" command.  If the CS initiated the

   original command then the CUA would have to issue the "TIMEOUT" and
   the CS would send the "ABORT" or "CONTINUE".

   Upon receiving an "ABORT" command, the command must then be
   terminated.  Only the "ABORT", "TIMEOUT", "REPLY, and "CONTINUE"
   commands can not be aborted.  The "ABORT", "TIMEOUT", and "REPLY"
   commands MUST NOT have latency set.

   Upon receiving a "CONTINUE" command the work continues.  Note that a
   new latency time MAY BE included in a "CONTINUE" command indicating
   to continue the original command until the "LATENCY" parameter value
   expires or the results of the original command can be returned.

   Both the "LATENCY" parameter and the "ACTION" parameter MUST BE
   supplied to any "CMD" property, or nether can be added to the "CMD"
   property.  The "LATENCY" parameter MUST BE set to the maximum latency
   time in seconds.  The "ACTION" parameter accepts the following
   values: "ASK" and "ABORT" parameters.

   If the maximum latency time is exceeded and the "ACTION" parameter is
   set to the "ASK" value, then "TIMEOUT" command MUST BE sent.
   Otherwise if the "ACTION" parameter is set to the "ABORT" value then
   the command MUST BE terminated and return a REQUEST-STATUS code of
   2.0.3 for the original command.

   If a CS can both start sending the reply to a command and guarantee
   that all of the results can be sent from a command (short of
   something like network or power falure), prior to the "LATENCY"
   timeout value, then the "LETENCY" time has not expired.

   Example:

   In this example the initiator asks for the listeners capabilities.

   A CUA MAY send a "CREATE" command to a CS.  The "CREATE" command MUST
   BE implemented by all CSs.

   The CS MUST NOT send a "CREATE" command to any CUA.

   The "TARGET" property specifies the containers where the component(s)
   will be created.  This can be a "CSID", or a "CALID" value type.

   If the iCalendar object being created does not have a "METHOD"
   property, then is not an [iTIP] object, then its state will be
   "BOOKED".  Use the "DELETE" command to set the state of an object to
   the "DELETED" state.  A CUA can not use the "CREATE" command to
   create an object in the "DELETED" state.

   If an [iTIP] object is being booked, then the "METHOD" property MUST
   NOT BE supplied".  Otherwise any [iTIP] object MUST have a valid
   [iTIP] "METHOD" property value and it is a scheduling request being
   deposited into the CS and will have its state set to "UNPROCESSED"
   state.

   To create a new component in multiple containers simply name all of
   the containers in the "TARGET" in the create command.  Here a new
   "VEVENT" component is created in two TARGET components.  In this
   example, the "VEVENT" component is one new [iTIP] "REQUEST" to be
   stored in two calendars.  The results would be iCalendar objects that
   conform to the [iTIP] replies as defined in [iTIP].

   The "VREPLY" components MUST always be returned in the same order
   that the objects were listed in the original "CREATE" command.  If
   there are multiple "TARGET" properties and components in the same
   create command then the reply is first listed by the "TARGET" order
   of the original create command, then component replies within that
   "TARGET" are ordered the same as in the original create command.

   This example shows two "VEVENT" components being created in each of
   the two supplied "TARGET" properties:

   Purpose: The "DELETE" command physically removes the QUERY result
   from the store or marks it for deletion.

                ; and MAY occur more than once

                / (";" xparam)

               )


   The "DELETE" command is used to delete calendars or components.  The
   included "VQUERY" component(s) specifies the container(s) to delete.

   If a component is to be marked for delete and not physically removed,
   then include the "OPTIONS" parameter with its value set to the "MARK"
   value in order to alter its state to "DELETED".

   When components are deleted, only the top most component "REQUEST-
   STATUS" properties are returned.  No "REQUEST-STATUS" properties are
   returned for components inside of the selected components.  There
   MUST BE one "VREPLY" component returned for each object that is
   deleted or marked for delete.

   value in the above example.  Each unique "METHOD" property value that
   was deleted from the store MUST BE in a separate iCalendar object.
   This is because only one "METHOD" property is allowed in a single
   "VCALENDAR" BEGIN/END block.

10.2 GENERATE-UID Command

   CMD: GENERATE-UID

   Purpose: The "GENERATE-UID" command returns one or more unique
   identifiers which MUST BE globally unique.

   The "GENERATE-UID" command MAY BE sent to any CS.  The "GENERATE-UID"
   command MUST BE implemented by all CSs.

   The "GENERATE-UID" command MUST NOT be sent to a CUA.

10.3 GET-CAPABILITY Command

   CMD: GET-CAPABILITY

   Purpose: The "GET-CAPABILITY" command returns the capabilities of the
   other end of the session.

   A CUA MUST send a "GET-CAPABILITY" command to a CS after the initial
   connection.  The "GET-CAPABILITY" command MUST BE implemented by all
   CSs.

   The CS MUST send a "GET-CAPABILITY" command to a CUA after the
   initial connection.  The CUA MUST recogonize the "GET-CAPABILITY"
   command and MAY return a not implemented reply meaning that the CUA
   supports only the default capababilities.

   Formal Definition: A "GET-CAPABILITY" command is defined by the
   following notation:

                      )


   Response:

   The "GET-CAPABILITY" command returns information about the Calendar
   other end of the session given the current state of the connection.
   The values returned may differ depending on current user identify and
   the security level of the connection.

   Client implementations SHOULD NOT require any capability element
   beyond those defined in this specification, and MAY ignore any
   nonstandard, experimental capability elements.  The "GET-CAPABILITY"
   reply may return  different results depending on the UPN and if the
   UPN is authenticated.

   When sending a reply to a "GET-CAPABILITY" command, all of these MUST
   BE supplied.  If the CUA does not support sending a full reply and
   sends not-implemented error, then the CS MUST assume the CUA supports
   the default values as defined below.  A CS MUST always send the full
   reply when queried.

   When the CUA does not support sending a "GET-CAPABILITY" reply, then
   the CS MUST assume the defaults listed below.  The following
   properties are returned in response to a "GET-CAPABILITY" command:

                              for this version of CAP. Like the "VERSION"
                              property, it may have a range. Uses the exact
                              same syntax as the "VERSION" property value.
                              The default is "1.0".

     CAR-LEVEL          1     Indicates level of CAR support. CAR-NONE,
                              CAR-MIN or CAR-FULL-1. If CAR-FULL-1 is
                              supplied then CAR-MIN MUST BE assumed.
                              A CAR-MIN implementation only supports
                              the DEFAULT-VCARS listed in the VCALSTORE
                              and does not support the creation or
                              modification of VCARS.
                              The default is CAR-NONE.

                              includes any components inside of
                              other components (VALARM for example).
                              It MUST include at least VCALSTORE, VCALENDAR,
                              VREPLY, and VAGENDA and at least one of VEVENT,

                              separately when they are stored (RRULEs
                              converted to RDATEs) and when sent. If
                              FALSE then it expands instances dynamically
                              during sending. Default is FALSE.

      DATE-MAX          1     The datetime value in UTC beyond which the
                              server cannot accept. The default and and

      MAX-COMPONENT-SIZE
                        1     A positive integer value that specifies
                              the size of the largest iCalendar object
                              that can be accepted in octets.  Objects
                              larger than this will be rejected. A
                              default value of zero (0) means no limit.
                              This is also the maximum value of any BEEP
                              payload that will be accepted or sent.

      MULTIPART         1     A comma separated list of MIME multipart
                              the sender supports in lower case. The
                              default is no multipart support (empty
                              list). Example: MULTIPART:related,alternate

      PRODID            1     The product id. If supplied in the "VCALENDAR"
                              components, the values MUST BE identical to
                              what is sent in the "GET-CAPABILITY" reply
                              from the CUA or CS. The CUA and CS PRODID
                              values may differ from each other.

      QUERY-LEVEL       1     Indicates level of SQL support. The default
                              is CAL-QL-1 and CAL-QL-NONE can be supplied.
                              (CAL-QL-NONE is for CS's that allow ITIP
                              methods only to be deposited and nothing else).
                              The default value is CAL-QL-1.

                             The default of Zero (0) means unlimited.

      VERSION           1    Versions of iCalendar support. MUST BE at
                             least "2.0" (the default). This is the same
                             property as defined in [iCAL].

      RECUR-ACCEPTED    1    Whether recurrence rules are acceptable.

   "IDENTIFY" commands.

   The CS MUST NOT send a "IDENTIFY" command to any CUA.

   The CS determines through an internal mechanism if the credentials
   supplied at authentication permit the operation as the selected
   identity.  If they do, the session assumes the new identity,
   otherwise a security error is returned.

   Example:


      C: Content-Type: text/calendar
      C:
      C: BEGIN:VCALENDAR
      C: VERSION:2.0
      C: PRODID:-//someone's prodid

      S: VERSION:2.0
      S: PRODID:-//someone's prodid
      S: REQUEST-STATUS:2.0;Request Approved
      S: END:VCALENDAR

      Or if denied:

      S: Content-Type: text/calendar
      S:
      S: BEGIN:VCALENDAR
      S: PRODID:-//someone's prodid
      S: VERSION:2.0
      S: REQUEST-STATUS:6.4;Request Denied
      S: END:VCALENDAR

      And for the CUA to return to its original authenticated identity
      the OPTIONS parameter is omitted:

      C: Content-Type: text/calendar
      C:
      C: BEGIN:VCALENDAR
      C: VERSION:2.0
      C: PRODID:-//someone's prodid
      C: CMD;ID=unique-per-cua-995:IDENTIFY
      C: END:VCALENDAR


   The CS may accept (2.0) or deny (6.4) the request to return to the
   original identity.

   If a CS considers the "IDENTIFY" command an attempt to violate
   security, the CS MAY terminate the BEEP session without any further
   notice to the CUA after sending the "REQUEST-STATUS" 6.4 reply.

10.5 MODIFY Command

   CMD: MODIFY

   Purpose: The "MODIFY" command is used to modify existing components.

   A CUA MAY send a "MODIFY" command to a CS.  The "MODIFY" command MUST

   The "MODIFY" command is used to modify existing components.  The
   TARGET property specifies the calendars where the components exist
   that are going to be modified.

   The format of the request is two components inside of "VCALENDAR"
   component:


           BEGIN:VCALENDAR
           ...
           BEGIN:VQUERY
           ...
           END:VQUERY
           BEGIN:XXX
           ...old-values...
           END:XXX
           BEGIN:XXX
           ...new-values...
           END:XXX
           END:CALENDAR


   The "VQUERY" component selects the components that are to be
   modified.

   Where "XXX" above is a named component type (VEVENT, VTODO, ...).
   Both the old and new components MUST BE of the same type.

   The old-values is a component and the contents of that component are
   going to change and may contain information that helps uniquely
   identify the original component (SEQUENCE in the example below).  If
   the CS can not find a component that matches the QUERY and does not
   have at least all of the OLD-VALUES, then a 6.1 error is returned.

   The new-values is a component of the same type as old-values and new-
   values contains the new data for each selected component.  Any data
   that is in old-values and not in new-values is deleted from the
   selected component.  Any values in new-values that was not in old-
   values is added to the component.

   In this example the "VEVENT" component with a "UID" property value of
   'unique-58' has; the "LOCATION" property and "LAST-MODIFIED" property
   changed, the "VALARM" component with the "SEQUENCE" property with a
   value of "3" has its "TRIGGER" property disabled, the "X-LOCAL"
   property is removed from the "VEVENT" component, and a "COMMENT"
   property is added.

   Because "SEQUENCE" property is used to locate the "VALARM" component
   in this example,  both the old-values and the new-values contain the
   "SEQUENCE" property with a value of "3" and if the "SEQUENCE"
   property were to be left out of new-values, it would have been
   deleted.

     Example:

     C: Content-Type: text/calendar
     C:
     C: BEGIN:VCALENDAR
     C: VERSION:2.0
     C: PRODID:-//someone's prodid
     C: TARGET:my-cal
     C: CMD:ID=unique-mod:MODIFY
     C: BEGIN:VQUERY                   <- Query to select data set.
     C: QUERY:SELECT * FROM VEVENT WHERE UID = 'unique-58'
     C: END:VQUERY
     C: BEGIN:VEVENT                   <- Start of old data.
     C: LOCATION:building 3
     C: LAST-MODIFIED:20020101T123456Z
     C: X-LOCAL:some private stuff
     C: BEGIN:VALARM
     C: SEQUENCE:3
     C: TRIGGER;RELATED=END:PT5M
     C: END:VALARM
     C: END:VEVENT
     C: BEGIN:VEVENT                   <- End of new data.
     C: LOCATION:building 4
     C: LAST-MODIFIED:20020202T010203Z
     C: COMMENT:Ignore global trigger.
     C: BEGIN:VALARM
     C: SEQUENCE:3
     C: TRIGGER;ENABLE=FALSE:RELATED=END:PT5M
     C: END:VALARM
     C: END:VEVENT


   The "X-LOCAL" property was not supplied in the new-values, so it was
   deleted.  The "LOCATION" property value was altered, as was the
   "LAST-MODIFIED" value.  The "VALARM" component with a "SEQUENCE"
   property value of "3" had its "TRIGGER" property disabled, and the
   "SEQUENCE" property value did not change so it was not effected.  The
   "COMMENT" property was added.

   When it comes to inline ATTACHMENTs, the CUA only needs to uniquely
   identify the contents of the ATTACHMENT value in the old-values in
   order to delete them.  When the CS compares the attachment data it is
   compared in its binary form.  The ATTACHMENT value supplied by the
   CUA MUST BE valid encoded information.

   For example, to delete the same huge inline attachment from every
   VEVENT in 'my-cal' that has an "ATTACH" property value with the old-
   values:

           TARGET:my-cal
           CMD:MODIFY
           BEGIN:VQUERY
           QUERY:SELECT ATTACH FROM VEVENT
           END:VQUERY
           BEGIN:VEVENT
           ATTACH;FMTTYPE=image/basic;ENCODING=BASE64;VALUE=BINARY:

           END:VEVENT
           BEGIN:VEVENT
           END:VEVENT
           END:VCALENDAR


   Above the new-values is empty, so everything in the old-values is
   deleted.

   Furthermore, the following additional restrictions apply:

   1.  One can not change the "UID" property of a component.

   2.  If a contained component is changed inside of a selected
       component, and that contained component has multiple instances,
       then old-values MUST contain information that uniquely identifies
       the instance or instances that are changing.  It is valid to
       change more than one.  As all contained components that match
       old-values will be modified.  In the first modify example above,
       if "SEQUENCE" properties were to be deleted from both the old-
       values and new-values, then all "TRIGGER" properties that matched
       the old-values in all "VALARM" components in the selected
       "VEVENT" components would be disabled.

   3.  The result of the modify MUST BE a valid iCalendar object.

   Response:  A "VCALENDAR" component is returns with one ore more
   "REQUEST-STATUS" property values.

   If any error occurred:

      No component will be changed at all.  That is, it will appear just
      as it was prior to the modify and the CAP server SHOULD return a
      "REQUEST-STATUS" property for each error that occurred.

      There MUST BE at least one error reported.

   If multiple components are selected, then what uniquely identified
   the component MUST BE returned (UID, QUERYID, ...) if the component
   contains a unique identifier.  If not, sufficient information to
   uniquely identify the modified components MUST BE returned in the
   reply.

      Response:
              The REQUEST-STATUS in a VCALENDAR object.


   The content of each "result" is subject to the result restriction
   table defined below.

   The access control on the "VAGENDA" component after it has been moved
   to its new location in the calstore MUST BE at least as secure as it
   was prior to the move.  If the CS is not able to ensure the same
   level of security, a permission denied "REQUEST-STATUS" property
   value MUST BE returned and the "MOVE" command not performed.

   The "TARGET" property value specifies the new location, and the
   "VQUERY" component specifies the old location.

   Restriction Table for the "REPLY" command of any "MOVE" command.

   Response:

   The data in each result contains an iCalendar object composed of all
   the selected components enclosed in a "VREPLY" component.  Only
   "REQUEST-STATUS" property and the properties mentioned in the
   "SELECT" clause of the QUERY are included in the components.  Each
   iCalendar object is tagged with the "TARGET" property.

   Searching for objects

   In the example below objects on March 10,1999 between 080000Z and
   190000Z are read.  In this case only 4 properties for each objects
   are returned.  Two calendars are specified.  Only booked (vs
   scheduled) entries are to be returned (this example only selected
   VEVENT objects):

   The return values are subject to VCAR filtering.  That is, if the
   request contains properties to which the UPN does not have access,
   those properties will not appear in the return values.  If the UPN
   has access to at least one property of the component, but has been
   denied access to all properties called out in the request, the
   response will contain a single "REQUEST-STATUS" property indicating
   the error.

   Here the request was successful, but the "VEVENT" component contents
   were not accessible (4.1).

10.10 TIMEOUT Command

   CMD: TIMEOUT

   Purpose: The "TIMEOUT" command is only sent after a command has been
   sent with a latency value set.  When received it means the command
   could not be completed in the time allowed.

   Formal Definition: A "CONTINUE" command is defined by the following
   notation:

                        )

       The REPLY of any "TIMEOUT" command is:

         timeout-reply  = "BEGIN" ":" "VCALENDAR" CRLF
                           calprops

                           "END" ":" "VREPLY" CRLF



10.11 Response Codes

   Numeric response codes are returned using the "REQUEST-STATUS"
   property.

   The format of these codes is described in [iCAL], and extend in
   [iTIP] and [iMIP].  The following describes new codes added to this
   set and how existing codes apply to CAP.

   At the application layer response codes are returned as the value of
   a "REQUEST-STATUS" property.  The value type of this property is
   modified from that defined in [iCAL], in order to make the
   accompanying "REQUEST-STATUS" property text optional.


       Code              Description
       --------------------------------------------------------------
       2.0               Success. The parameters vary with the
                         operation and are specified.

       2.0.3             In response to the client issuing an
                         "abort" reply, this reply code indicates
                         that any command currently underway was
                         successfully aborted.

       3.1.4             Capability not supported.

                         such that it would overlap another object
                         in either of the following two circumstances:

                         (a) One of the objects has a TRANSP
                         property set to OPAQUE-NOCONFLICT or
                         TRANSPARENT-NOCONFLICT.

                         (b) The calendar's ALLOW-CONFLICT
                         property is set to FALSE.

       6.3               Bad args.

       6.4               Permission denied - VCAR restriction.
                         A VCAR exists and the CS will not perform
                         the operation.

       7.0               A timeout has occurred. The server was
                         unable to complete the operation in the
                         requested time.

       8.0               A failure has occurred in the Calendar Server
                         that prevents the operation from
                         succeeding.

       8.1               A query was performed and the query is
                         too complex for the CS. The operation
                         was not performed.

       8.2               Used to signal that an iCalendar object has
                         exceeded the server's size limit

       8.3               A DATETIME value was too far in the future
                         represented on this Calendar.

       8.4               A DATETIME value was too far in the past
                         to be represented on this Calendar.

       8.5               An attempt was made to create a new
                         object but the unique UID specified is
                         already in use.

       9.0               An unrecognized command was received.
                         Or an unsupported command was received.


       10.4              The operation has not been performed
                         because it would cause the resources
                         (memory, disk, CPU, etc) to exceed the

11. Object Registration

   This section provides the process for registration of new or modified
   properties, parameters, commands, or other modifications, additions,
   or deletions to objects.

11.1 Registration of New and Modified Entities

   New objects are registered by the publication of an IETF Request for
   Comment (RFC).  Changes to a objects are registered by the
   publication of a revision to the RFC in a new RFC.

11.2 Post the item definition

   The object description MUST BE posted to the new object discussion
   list: ietf-calendar@imc.org.

11.3 Allow a comment period

   Discussion on a new object MUST BE allowed to take place on the list
   for a minimum of two weeks.  Consensus MUST BE reached on the object
   before proceeding to the next step.

11.4 Release a new RFC

   The new object will be submitted for publication as any other
   internet draft requesting RFC status.

12. BEEP and CAP

12.1 BEEP Profile Registration

   TBD

12.2 BEEP Exchange Styles

   [BEEP] defines three styles of message exchange:

   MSG/ANS,ANS,...,NUL -  For one to many exchanges.

   MSG/RPY -  For one to one exchanges.

   MSG/ERR -  For requests the cannot be processed due to an error.

   A CAP request, targeted at more than one containers, MAY use a one-
   to-many exchange, with a distinct answer associated with each target.
   CAP request targeted at a single container MAY use a one-to-one
   exchange or a one-to-many exchange.  "MSG/ERR" MAY only be used when
   an error condition prevents the execution of the request on all the
   targeted calendars.

13. IANA Considerations

   This memo defines IANA registered extensions to the attributes
   defined by iCalendar, as defined in [iCAL], and [iTIP].

   IANA registration proposals for iCalendar and [iTIP] are to be mailed
   to the registration agent for the "text/calendar" [MIME] content-
   type, <MAILTO: ietf-calendar@imc.org> using the format defined in
   section 7 of [iCAL].

   If the IESG approves this memo for publication, then the IANA
   registers the profile specified in Section 12.1, and selects an IANA-
   specific URI, e.g., http://iana.org/beep/cap/1.0.

14. Security Considerations

   Access rights should be granted cautiously, consult Section 2.4.2 for
   a discussion of the subject.  Without careful planning it is possible
   to open up access to a greater degree than desired.

   The "IDENTIFY" command should be carefully implemented as discussed
   in Section 6.1.3.

   In addition, since CAP is a profile of the BEEP, consult [BEEP]'s
   Section 9 for a discussion of BEEP-specific security issues.

   Although service provisioning is a policy matter, at a minimum, all
   implementations must provide the following tuning profiles:

      for authentication: http://iana.org/beep/SASL/DIGEST-MD5

      for confidentiality: http://iana.org/beep/TLS (using the
      TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA cipher)

      for both: http://iana.org/beep/TLS (using the
      TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA cipher supporting client-side
      certificates)
