   At a congestion event, if the current _cwnd_ is less than _W_max_,
   this indicates that the saturation point experienced by this flow is
   getting reduced because of a change in available bandwidth.  Then we
   allow this flow to release more bandwidth by reducing _W_max_
   further.  This action effectively lengthens the time for this flow to
   increase its congestion window, because the reduced _W_max_ forces
   the flow to plateau earlier.  This allows more time for the new flow
   to catch up to its congestion window size.

   Fast Convergence is designed for network environments with multiple
   CUBIC flows.  In network environments with only a single CUBIC flow
   and without any other traffic, Fast Convergence SHOULD be disabled.
