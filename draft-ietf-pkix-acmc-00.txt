Abstract

   This document specifies modifications to the Certificate Management
   Messages over CMS specification ([CMCbis]) to permit the management
   of attribute certificates.  This document does not stand alone, but
   must be used in conjunction with [CMCbis].  It is expected that the
   modifications proposed here will also be used in conjunction with the
   Attribute Certificate Request Message Format specification ([ACRMF]).

1.  Introduction

   The key words "MUST", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "RECOMMENDED", and "MAY"
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   CMC [CMCbis] specifies the exchanges, structures, and controls for
   managing public key certificates.  This document extends CMC to
   handle attribute certificates.  It profiles CMC, adding new elements
   as necessary.

   CMC supports "Simple PKI Requests" and "Full PKI Requests".  The ACMC



Yee                                                             [Page 1]

Internet Draft                                              January 2002


   specification requires the use of the Full PKI Request form and its
   corresponding response.

2.  Request Modifications

   The two primary data structures in CMC are the PKIData content object
   and the ResponseBody content object.  Based on the name of the
   PKIData structure, one might not think that it is appropriate for
   attribute certificates; however its content is well-aligned with our
   purpose.  In particular, no changes are required at the top level of
   either PKIData or ResponseBody.

   Within the PKIData structure, the reqSequence (a sequence of
   TaggedRequest) element is modified in order to carry the ACRMF and
   other requests.  Thus, TaggedRequest becomes:

   TaggedRequest ::= CHOICE {
       tcr               [0] TaggedCertificationRequest, -- original
       crm               [1] CertRequestMsg,             -- original
       other             [2] ANY DEFINED BY OID -- others including ACRMF

   Implementations MAY allow requests for both public key and attribute
   certificates in a single reqSequence.


3.  Control Attribute Modifications

   CMC specifies a large number of control attributes that can be
   applied as part of certificate requests.  Many of these are
   inappropriate for attribute certificates.  In particular, ACMC only
   uses the following controls:

      Control Attribute         OID            Syntax
      _________________       __________     ______________
      dataReturn              id-cmc 4       OCTET STRING
      transactionID           id-cmc 5       INTEGER
      senderNonce             id-cmc 6       OCTET STRING
      recipientNonce          id-cmc 7       OCTET STRING

      getCert                 id-cmc 15      GetCert
      getCRL                  id-cmc 16      GetCRL
      revokeRequest           id-cmc 17      RevokeRequest
      regInfo                 id-cmc 18      OCTET STRING
      responseInfo            id-cmc 19      OCTET STRING
      queryPending            id-cmc 21      OCTET STRING
      idConfirmCertAcceptance id-cmc 24      CMCCertId
      cmcStatusInfoExt        id-cmc XX      CMCStatusInfoExt




Yee                                                             [Page 2]

Internet Draft                                              January 2002


   Additional control attributes are defined: addAttribute and sendCert,
   discussed later.

      Control Attribute         OID            Syntax
      _________________       __________       ______________
      addAttribute            id-cmc <acmc01>  AddAttribute
      sendTo                  id-cmc <acmc02>  SendTo

   It is possible that a control attribute to support additional
   retrieval indices for attribute certificates will be added if getCert
   cannot be suitably modified.


3.1.  Data Return Control Attribute

   dataReturn, [CMCbis] Section 5.4, is supported without modification
   by ACMC.


3.2.  Transaction ID Control Attribute

   transactionID, [CMCbis] Section 5.6, is supported without
   modification by ACMC.


3.3.  Sender Nonce Control Attribute

   senderNonce, [CMCbis] Section 5.6, is supported without modification
   by ACMC.


3.4.  Recipient Nonce Control Attribute

   recipientNonce, [CMCbis] Section 5.6, is supported without
   modification by ACMC.


3.5.  Add Extensions Control Attribute

   The addExtensions control attribute, [CMCbis] Section 5.5, is
   supported by ACMC.  In order to match [ACRMF] messages, the
   certReferences sequence is additionally allowed to be equal to the
   attrCertReqId of the AttrCertRequest within an AttrCertReqMsg (see
   ACRMF, Section 3).  Also, when the extensions are being applied to an
   attribute certificate, the requirement shall be that servers MUST be
   able to process all extensions defined in [ACPROF].

3.6.  Get Certificate Control Attribute

   ACMC supports the getCert control attribute ([CMCbis] Section 5.9).
   Currently, getCert only supports retrieval based upon the issuerName
   and serialNumber combination.

   Additional retrieval scenarios are envisaged, as expressed in
   [CERTHTTP].  Beyond that, attribute certificates have other means by
   which they can be indexed and retrieved.  In particular, retrieval by
   holder name in conjunction with a particular set of attribute types
   would be useful.


3.7.  Get CRL Control Attribute

   The getCRL control attribute ([CMCbis] Section 5.10) is supported as
   is by ACMC.


3.8.  Revoke Request Control Attribute

   The revokeRequest control attribute ([CMCbis] Section 5.11)is
   supported as specified in CMC.  Some of the CRLReason codes used,
   however, are not suitable for use with attribute certificates.  In
   particular, only the unspecified, affliationChanged, superseded,
   cessationOfOperation, privilegeWithdrawn, or aACompromise values
   should be used when revoking an attribute certificate.

   More generally, this control attribute is not appropriate to employ
   if the noRevAvail extension is present in the attribute certificate
   and its value is set to TRUE.

   The protocol does not specify which entities are allowed to request
   the revocation of a certificate.

   The revoke request control attribute allows revocation of a public
   key certificate without having a signature on the request.  A
   password is used for authentication in this case.  For attribute
   certificates, this capability is not supported.  If the private
   signing key is lost, then the public key certificate should be
   revoked.  Attribute certificates that are explicitly linked to the
   public key certificate being revoked will simply fail to verify.


3.9.  Registration Information Control Attribute

   The regInfo control attribute ([CMCbis] Section 5.12) is supported as
   specified in CMC.



Yee                                                             [Page 4]

Internet Draft                                              January 2002


3.10.  Response Information Control Attribute

   The responseInfo control attribute ([CMCbis] Section 5.12) is
   supported as specified in CMC.


3.11.  Query Pending Control Attribute

   The queryPending control attribute ([CMCbis] Section 5.13) is
   supported as specified in CMC.


3.12.  Confirm Certificate Acceptance Control Attribute

   The idConfirmCertAcceptance control attribute ([CMCbis] Section 5.14)
   is supported as specified in CMC.

4.  New Control Attributes


4.1.  Add Attributes Control Attribute

   The addAttributes control attribute is analogous to the addExtensions
   control attribute.

   The Add Attributes control attribute is used by LARAs to specify
   additional attributes that are to be placed on certificates.  This
   attribute uses the following ASN.1 definition:

        AddAttributes ::= SEQUENCE

            pkiDataReference             BodyPartID
            certReferences               SEQUENCE OF BodyPartID,
            attributes                   SEQUENCE OF Attribute
        }

   -- pkiDataReference field contains the body part identifier of the
   embedded request message.

   -- certReferences field is a list of references to one or more of the
   payloads contained within a PKIData.  Each element of the
   certReferences sequence MUST be equal to either the bodyPartID of a
   TaggedCertificationRequest, the certReqId of the CertRequest within a
   CertReqMsg, or the attrCertReqId of the AttrCertRequest within an
   AttrCertReqMsg.  By definition, the listed attributes are to be
   applied to every element referenced in the certReferences sequence.
   If a request corresponding to bodyPartID cannot be found, the error
   badRequest is returned referencing this control attribute.



Yee                                                             [Page 5]

Internet Draft                                              January 2002


   -- attributes field contains the sequence of attributes to be applied
   to the referenced certificate requests.

   Servers MUST be able to process all attributes defined in [ACPROF].
   Servers are not required to be able to process every attribute
   transmitted using this protocol.  Servers are not required to put all
   LARA-requested attributes into a certificate.  Servers are permitted
   to modify LARA-requested attributes.  Servers MUST NOT alter an
   attribute so as to reverse the meaning of a client-requested
   attribute.  If a certification request is denied due to the inability
   to handle a requested attribute and a response is returned, the
   server MUST return a failInfo attribute with the value of
   unsupportedAttr.

   If multiple Add Attributes statements exist in an enrollment message,
   the exact behavior is left up to the certificate issuer policy.
   However it is recommended that the following policy be used.  These
   rules would be applied to individual attribute within an Add
   Attributes control attribute (as opposed to an "all or nothing"
   approach).

   1. If the conflict is within a single PKIData object, the certificate
   request would be rejected with an error of badRequest.

   2. If the conflict is between different PKIData objects, the
   outermost version of the attribute would be used (allowing a LARA to
   override the attribute requested by the end-entity).  If the
   attributes requested by an end-entity are overridden, then the
   returned status SHALL so indicate (see Section X.Y).


4.2.  Send To Control Attribute

   The Send To Control Attribute indicates to the Attribute Authority
   that a copy of the generated attribute certificate should be sent to
   the designated recipient.  Such a service is useful in cases when the
   entity for whom the attribute certificate is issued is not the
   requester.  [Probably want a good example here.]

        SendTo ::=   -- Syntax TBD

   [Additional syntax-based description of SendTo goes here.]


5.  Status Modifications

   To support attribute certificates, additional return values for the
   cmcStatusInfoExt control attribute are defined.  The set of failure



Yee                                                             [Page 6]

Internet Draft                                              January 2002


   information values defined in [CMC] Section 5.1.4 are extended with:

        unsupportedAttr    (13) -- A requested attribute was not
        supported by the recipient AA attrModified       (14) --
        Requested attribute values were modified by the AA
        policydoesnotAllow (15) -- Policy does not allow the granting of
        a requested attribute or -- attribute value

6.  Additional Notes

   In the Full PKI Response generated when a new attribute certificate
   is requested, this profile requires that the certificates field of
   the signedData object MUST contain (at a minimum) the AA's PKC.
   Other certificates that form the certificate chain for the AA's PKC
   MAY be included in the certificates field.


   Security considerations are not yet discussed in this memo.
