Abstract

   This draft proposes unified L2 abstractions for L3-driven fast
   handovers.  For efficient network communication, it is vital for a
   protocol layer to know or utilize other layer's information such as a
   form of L2 triggers.  However, each protocol layer is basically
   designed independently.  Since each protocol layer is also
   implemented independently in current operating systems, it is very
   hard to exchange control information between protocol layers.  To
   solve the problem, this draft defines nine kinds of L2 abstractions
   in the form of "primitive" to achieve fast handovers in the network
   layer.  This mechanism is called "L3-driven fast handovers" because
   the network layer initiates L2 and L3 handovers by using the
   "primitives".

1.  Introduction

   In recent years, the execution environment around computers is not
   static and changes dynamically.  Especially, when a mobile node moves
   to a different network, its communication environment considerably
   changes.  For example, in the case of wireless communication,
   parameters such as radio strength largely changes depending on time
   or site.

   For efficient network communication, it is vital for a protocol layer
   to know or utilize other layer's control information.  There are
   several proposals for seamless handovers in IPv6 network such as Fast
   Handovers for Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6) [1] and Hierarchical Mobile IPv6
   (HMIPv6) [2].  In FMIPv6, the network layer must know the indication
   of a handover from the link layer in advance to achieve seamless
   handovers.  However, control information exchange between protocol
   layers is not allowed because each protocol layer is designed
   independently.

   To solve the problem, this draft defines nine kinds of L2
   abstractions in the form of "primitive" to achieve fast handovers in
   the network layer.  This mechanism is called "L3-driven fast
   handovers" because the network layer initiates L2 and L3 handovers by
   using the "primitives".

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms.


   L3-Driven Fast Handover

      The handover mechanism which is initiated by the network layer on
      a mobile node.  Since this mechanism allows the handover
      preparation in L3 before the start of an L2 handover on the mobile
      node, it can reduce packet loss during a handover.  The L3-driven
      fast handover mechanism requires L2 information as a trigger of a
      handover procedure.


   PoA

      The attachment point of a mobile node. (e.g., An access point in
      IEEE 802.11 networks.)


   Primitive

      A unit of information which is sent from one layer to another.
      There are four classes of primitives: Request, Confirm, Indication
      and Response.  One or more classes of a primitive are exchanged
      depending on the type of the primitive.

3.  Primitives for L2 Abstractions

   Each layer offers its services in the form of primitives.  Four
   classes of primitives are defined as shown in Figure 1.  Request is
   issued by the layer that wants to get the services or the information
   from another layer, and Confirm is the acknowledgment of the request.
   Indication is the notification of the information to the layer that
   requested the service, and Response is the acknowledgment of the
   indication.  In this architecture, a layer can evenly communicate
   with each other.


   -------------------------   -----------------------------
             Request                       Response
               ||      /\             /\      ||
   Layer N     ||      ||             ||      ||
   ------------||------||---   -------||------||------------
               ||      ||             ||      ||
               \/      ||             ||      \/
   Layer N-m        Confirm       Indication
   -------------------------   -----------------------------

                Figure 1: Interaction Model between Layers


   The primitive consists of five fields: protocol layer ID, protocol
   ID, primitive class (Request, Response, Indication, or Confirm),
   primitive name, and parameters.  The protocol layer ID specifies to
   which layer this primitive should be sent, e.g., Layer 2 or Layer 3.
   The protocol ID specifies to which protocol entity this primitive
   should be sent, e.g., IEEE802.11 or IEEE802.3.

   For unified L2 abstractions for L3-driven fast handovers, three
   different usages of "Primitives" are defined as described below:

   Type 1.  To provide L2 information to upper layers immediately

            This type of primitives is used to provide the L2
            information to upper layers immediately.  The "Request" and
            "Confirm" classes of primitives MUST be exchanged for the
            interaction.  The "Request" primitive is for an acquisition
            request for the L2 information.  The "Confirm" primitive is
            for the answer.

   Type 2.  To notify upper layers of L2 events asynchronously

            This type of primitives is used to notify upper layers of L2
            events asynchronously.  The "Request", "Confirm" and

Internet-Draft               L2 Abstractions               February 2007


            "Indication" classes of primivits MUST be exchanged and the
            "Response" class MAY be exchanged for the interaction.  The
            "Request" and "Confirm" primitives are used just for
            registration.  When an event occurs, the "Indication"
            primitive is asynchronously delivered to the upper layer.

   Type 3.  To control L2 actions from upper layers

            This type of primitives is used to control L2 actions from
            upper layers.  The "Request" and "Confirm" classes of
            primitives MUST be exchanged for the interaction.  The
            "Request" primitive is a request for operation.  Ack or nack
            returns immediately as the "Confirm" primitive.

   A protocol entity can register primitives anytime by exchanging the
   Request and Confirm messages which include the fields defined above.
   When the registered event occurs, the Indication and Response
   messages are exchanged as well.

   The way how to exchange a message between protocol entities is out of
   scope of this document.  Any information exchange method between
   layers such as the work [3] can be used.

   The timing when an Indication primitive is sent is also out of scope
   of this document.  For example, a layer 2 event is generated when
   layer 2 status has been changed and this is depended on how you
   implement e.g. scanning algorithms.

4.  Definitions of Primitives

   To obtain and exchange L2 information, the following Primitives are
   defined.

4.1.  L2-LinkStatus (Type 1)

   The L2-LinkStatus.request primitive is sent to the link layer when an
   upper layer needs the current information of a link.  The L2-
   LinkStatus.request primitive contains the "Network Interface ID"
   parameter.  In response, the L2-LinkStatus.confirm primitive returns.
   The L2-LinkStatus.confirm primitive contains three parameters:
   "Network Interface ID", "PoA", and "Condition".  "PoA" and
   "Condition" indicate the current status of the link between the
   mobile node and a PoA.

4.2.  L2-PoAList (Type 1)

   The L2-PoAList.request primitive is sent to the link layer when an
   upper layer needs a list of the candidate PoAs.  The L2-
   PoAList.request primitive contains the "Network Interface ID"
   parameter.  In response, the L2-PoAList.confirm primitive returns
   with the "Network Interface ID" parameter and the "PoA List"
   parameter.  The "PoA List" parameter is a list of the candidate PoAs.

4.3.  L2-PoAFound (Type 2)

   The L2-PoAFound.indication primitive is asynchronously provided to an
   upper layer when new PoAs are detected.  This primitive carries the
   "Network Interface ID" parameter and the "PoA List" parameter.  The
   "PoA List" parameter contains the information of new PoAs detected by
   the mobile node.  In order to use this notification, the registration
   process using the L2-PoAFound.request primitive and the L2-
   PoAFound.confirm primitive is needed in advance.  The L2-
   PoAFound.request primitive has two parameters: "Network Interface ID"
   and "Enable/Disable".  The "Enable/Disable" parameter shows whether
   this notification function is turned on.  When this registration
   succeeds, the L2-PoAFound.confirm primitive returns with the "Network
   Interface ID" parameter and the "Ack" parameter in response.

4.4.  L2-PoALost (Type 2)

   The L2-PoALost.indication primitive is asynchronously provided to an
   upper layer when a PoA included in the list of candidate PoAs
   disappears.  This primitive carries the "Network Interface ID"
   parameter and the "PoA List" parameter.  The "PoA List" parameter
   contains the information of the PoAs which disappeared from the
   candidates list.  The registration process using the L2-

Internet-Draft               L2 Abstractions               February 2007


   PoALost.request primitive and the L2-PoALost.confirm primitive is
   similar to the L2-PoAFound primitive described above.

4.5.  L2-LinkUp (Type 2)

   The L2-LinkUp.indication primitive is asynchronously provided to an
   upper layer when a new link is connected.  This primitive carries the
   "Network Interface ID" parameter and the "PoA" parameter.  The L2-
   LinkUp.request primitive contains the "Network Interface ID"
   parameter and the "Enable/Disable" parameter for registration.  When
   the registration succeeded, the L2-LinkUp.confirm primitive with the
   "Network Interface ID" parameter and the "Ack" parameter returns.

4.6.  L2-LinkDown (Type 2)

   The L2-LinkDown.indication primitive is asynchronously provided to an
   upper layer when an existing link is disconnected.  The registration
   processing is same as the L2-LinkUp primitive described above.

4.7.  L2-LinkStatusChanged (Type 2)

   The L2-LinkStatusChanged.indication primitive is asynchronously
   provided to an upper layer when the status of an link has changed.
   This notification contains three parameters: "Network Interface ID",
   "PoA", and "Condition".  The "PoA" parameter indicates the attachment
   point at which the link quality changed.  In the registration
   processing, the L2-LinkStatusChanged.request primitive carries the
   "Network Interface ID" parameter, the "Enable/Disable" parameter, and
   the "Condition" parameter.  "Condition" indicates the event type and
   the threshold for the indication.

4.8.  L2-LinkConnect (Type 3)

   The L2-LinkConnect.request primitive is sent to the link layer when
   an upper layer has to establish a new link to the specific "PoA".
   This primitive carries the "Network Interface ID" parameter and the
   "PoA" parameter.  This operation begins after the link layer returns
   the L2-LinkConnect.confirm primitive with "Ack".

4.9.  L2-LinkDisconnect (Type 3)

   The L2-LinkDisconnect.request primitive is sent to the link layer
   when an upper layer has to tear down an existing link to the specific
   "PoA".  This primitive carries the "Network Interface ID" parameter
   and the "PoA" parameter.  This operation begins after the link layer
   returns the L2-LinkDisconnect.confirm primitive with "Ack".

5.  Definitions of Static Parameters

   This section lists static parameters.  Once the values of static
   parameters are configured, they basically remain unchanged during
   communication.  The following parameters are transferred as a part of
   primitives.

5.1.  Network Interface ID

   The "Network interface ID" parameter uniquely identifies the network
   interface in the node.  The syntax of the identifier is
   implementation-specific (e.g., name, index or unique address assigned
   to each interface).  This parameter also contains the network
   interface type which indicates the kind of technology of the network
   interface (e.g., IEEE802.11a/b/g, 3GPP, etc.).  This parameter is
   required in all primitives.

Internet-Draft               L2 Abstractions               February 2007


6.  Definitions of Dynamic Parameters

   This section lists dynamic parameters.  The values of dynamic
   parameters change frequently during communication.  The following
   parameters are transferred as a part of primitives.

6.1.  PoA

   The "PoA" parameter uniquely identifies the PoA.

6.2.  Condition

   The "Condition" parameter consists of the following sub-parameters:
   available bandwidth and link quality level.  These sub-parameters are
   the abstracted information that indicates the current quality-of
   service.  The abstraction algorithms of sub-parameters depend on
   hardware devices and software implementation.  The useful range of
   link quality is divided into five levels; EXCELLENT, GOOD, FAIR, BAD,
   NONE in descending order.

6.3.  PoA List

   The "PoA List" parameter consists of arbitrary couples of two sub-
   parameters: "PoA" and "Condition".  This parameter shows a list of
   PoAs and its condition.

6.4.  Enable/Disable

   The "Enable/Disable" flag is used for turning event notification on/
   off.  When an upper layer needs notifications, the "Request"
   primitive with "Enable" is sent to the link layer as registration.
   When an upper layer needs no more notifications, the "Request"
   primitive with "Disable" is sent.

6.5.  Ack/Error

   When an upper layer requests some notifications, the link layer
   receives and confirms this "Request".  If the "Request" is valid, the
   "Confirm" primitive with "Ack" is sent to the upper layer.  If it is
   invalid, the "Confirm" with "Error" is sent to the upper layer.

7.  Architectural Considerations

   The IAB document "Architectural Implications of Link Indications" [4]
   discusses the role and the issues of link indications within the
   Internet Architecture.  This section discusses the architectural
   considerations mentioned in Section 2 of the IAB document.


   [1]   Proposals should avoid use of simplified link models in
         circumstances where they do not apply.

         The information in each layer should be abstracted before it is
         sent to another layer.  For example, in IEEE 802.11, the
         Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), the number of
         retransmissions and existence of association between the mobile
         node and the access point are used so that the link layer
         indications can adjust themselves to various environments or
         situations.  The thresholds needed for some link indications
         are defined from empirical study.

         In the conventional protocol layering model, the Protocol
         Entity (PE) is defined as the entity that processes a specific
         protocol.  Our proposal introduced the Abstract Entity (AE) to
         achieve link independency of the link indications.  An AE and a
         PE make a pair.  An AE abstracts the PE-dependent information
         to the PE-independent information.

         Figure 2 shows AEs and PEs using primitives.


   [2]   Link indications should be clearly defined, so that it is
         understood when they are generated on different link layers.

         To make the link information/indications clear, our proposal
         defines the 4 types of primitives; request/confirm and
         indication/response as described in Section 3.  The request is
         used to obtain the information of another layer.  The confirm
         is the reply to the request and it includes the requested
         information.  The indication is generated when a particular
         event occurred.  The response is the reply to the indication.

         In our proposal about IEEE 802.11b, L2-LinkUp is defined as the
         status in which an association to the AP is established, and
         L2-LinkDown is defined as the status in which an association to
         the AP is not established.  L2-LinkGoingdown is generated when
         the link quality becomes below the predefined threshold.  Since
         the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the number of
         retransmissions are used to abstract and evaluate the link

         quality, L2-LinkStatusChanged represents the link quality in
         both directions.  It should use an average of RSSI or the
         number of retransmissions damped for one second or more to cope
         with transient link conditions.


   [3]   Proposals must demonstrate robustness against misleading
         indications.

         Since RSSI changes largely even when the mobile node stands
         still according to the measurements in our experiments, our
         proposal uses the RSSI, the number of retransmissions, and the
         existence of an association to calculate the link status as
         described above.  In our experiments, there were some "ping-
         pong" handovers between two APs.  Such ping-pong handovers
         could be reduced by detecting the most suitable AP by L2-
         LinkStatus when L2-LinkStatusChanged is notified.  The use of
         L2 indications is related to parameter thresholds which trigger
         handover.  These thresholds vary based on the deployment
         scenario, and if not configured properly, could lead to
         misleading indications.


   [4]   Upper layers should utilize a timely recovery step so as to
         limit the potential damage from link indications determined to
         be invalid after they have been acted on.

         The proposed L3-driven handover described in Appendix D uses
         the L2-LinkStatusChanged indication as the trigger for starting
         handover.  L2-LinkStatusChanged is indicated when the link
         quality goes down below the specific threshold.  This
         indication is not canceled even if the link quality goes up
         soon.  As described above, L2-LinkStatus can be used to detect
         the most suitable AP.  The IP layer can cancel a handover if it
         finds that the current AP is the most suitable one by using L2-
         LinkStatus when L2-LinkStatusChanged is notified.


   [5]   Proposals must demonstrate that effective congestion control is
         maintained.

         Since this mechanism is coupled to the IP layer, and not
         directly to the transport layer, the proposed mechanism is not
         directly affecting congestion control.

   [6]   Proposals must demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed
         optimizations.

         In IPv6 mobility, the L3-driven handover mechanism using link
         indications can dramatically reduce gap time due to handover.
         The L3-driven handover mechanism needs the L2-LinkStatusChanged
         indication to predict disconnection.  But L2-LinkStatusChanged
         is not sometimes trusted because it is difficult to abstract
         the link quality.  Invalid L2-LinkStatusChanged may cause
         redundant handover.  A handover mechanism using only L2-LinkUp/
         L2-LinkDown can also reduce gap time modestly.  An example of
         an implementation and an evaluation of the L3-driven handover
         mechanism is described in Appendix D.


   [7]   Link indications should not be required by upper layers, in
         order to maintain link independence.

         Our proposal does not require any modifications to the
         transport and upper layers.


   [8]   Proposals should avoid race conditions, which can occur where
         link indications are utilized directly by multiple layers of
         the stack.

         Since our proposal defines the link indications to only the IP
         layer, race conditions between multiple layers never happen.


   [9]   Proposals should avoid inconsistencies between link and routing
         layer metrics.

         Our proposal does not deal with routing metrics.


   [10]  Overhead reduction schemes must avoid compromising
         interoperability and introducing link layer dependencies into
         the Internet and Transport layers.

         As described above, the link indications in our proposal are
         abstracted to the information independent of link types to
         reduce the gap time due to a handover, and the ordinary host
         can execute handover without using the link indications defined
         in our proposal.

   [11]  Proposals advocating the transport of link indications beyond
         the local host need to carefully consider the layering,
         security and transport implications.  In general, implicit
         signals are preferred to explicit transport of link indications
         since they add no new packets in times of network distress,
         operate more reliably in the presence of middle boxes such as
         NA(P)Ts, are more likely to be backward compatible, and are
         less likely to result in security vulnerabilities.

         Our proposal does not define exchange of link indications
         between nodes.

8.  Security Considerations

   The IAB document "Architectural Implications of Link Indications" [4]
   discusses the role and the issues of link indications within the
   Internet Architecture.  This section discusses the security
   considerations mentioned in Section 4 of the IAB document.


   [1]  Spoofing

        Our proposal is no more insecure than a particular link layer on
        which it is implemented.


   [2]  Indication validation

        Transportation of the link indications between nodes is not
        assumed, hence this consideration is out of scope in our
        proposal.


   [3]  Denial of service

        Our proposal is no more insecure than a particular link layer on
        which it is implemented.

   First, the L3 issues LinkUp.request to receive LinkUp.indication when
   the link becomes available.  The L3 also issues
   LinkStatusChanged.request to receive LinkStatusChanged.indication
   when the link quality goes down below the threshold.

   In the beginning of the L3-driven handover procedure, the L2 detects
   the radio signal strength is going down.  Then the L2 sends L2-
   LinkStatusChanged.indication to the L3.  The L3 prepares for handover
   (e.g., CoA generation, DAD, ND cache creation, and routing table
   setting) and sends L2-PoAList.request to the L2 if the list of access
   points is needed.

   If the L3 decides to perform handover according to some rules, the L3
   sends L2-LinkConnect.request with some parameters about candidate
   access points to request L2 handover.  L2 handover begins after the
   L3 sends L2-LinkConnect.confirm to the L2.  When the L2 handover
   finished, the L2 sends L2-LinkUp.indication to notify the L3.
   Finally, the L3 performs handover (e.g., sending BU).

   One of the important features of L3-driven fast handover using
   Primitives is that the L3 handover preparation can be done during
   communication.  So, it can reduce disruption time during handover.

   the access point identifiers to the subnet router information.  To

   send RtSolPr, a MN discovers one or more access points by sending L2-
   PoAList.request to the link layer.  As a response to L2-
   PoAList.request, L2-PoAList.confirm returns with "PoA List" parameter
   which contains identifiers and conditions of nearby access points.
   After initial AP discovery, L2-PoAFound.indication with "PoA List" is
   also sent from the link layer when one or more access points are
   discovered.

   When the link layer of the MN detects that radio signal strength is
   going down, it sends L2-LinkStatusChanged.indication to the network
   layer.  Then, the MN sends the FBU message to the PAR as the
   beginning of the L3 handover procedure.  The NCoA required for the
   FBU message is determined according to the MN's policy database and
   the received PrRtAdv message.  As a response to the FBU message, the
   MN receives the FBack message and then immediately switches its link
   by L2-LinkConnect.request with the specific "PoA" parameter.  The
   handover policy of the MN is outside the scope of this document.

   After L2 handover, the link layer of the MN sends L2-
   LinkUp.indication to the network layer.  The MN immediately sends the
   FNA message to the NAR.  The NAR will send tunneled and buffered
   packets to the MN.

   Scenario 1 was used in this experiment.  Upon receiving L2-
   LinkStatusChanged.indication, the L3 of the MN sends the FBU message
   and then receives the FBack message.  It took 20ms from the
   transmission of the FBU message and the reception of the FBack
   message.  After receiving the FBack message, the L3 of the MN issues
   L2-LinkConnect.request to the L2.  When L2 handover finishes, the L3
   receives L2-LinkUp.ind from the L2.  It took 1ms for an L2 handover.
   Next, the MN sends the FNA message to the NAR.  Upon receiving the
   FNA message, the NAR starts forwarding packets to the NM.  ICMP echo
   request packets were sent at 10ms intervals.  It was observed that no
   or 1 ICMP echo reply packet was lost during a handover.

Appendix C.  Example Mapping of Primitives and IEEE802.11

   This section shows examples of the mapping between "Primitives" and
   IEEE802.11 parameters.

C.1.  L2-LinkStatus

   Most of parameters of L2-LinkStatus are related to the configuration
   of network interface hardware.  The operating system and the device
   driver module can easily collect such information.  However, to
   create the "Condition" parameter, the MN should maintain statistics
   and parameters related to the current wireless environment.

   There are two sub-parameters of the "Condition" parameter: available
   bandwidth and link quality level.  The available bandwidth of the
   current PoA can be obtained by maintaining the transmission rate
   indication and the statistics of frame transmission at every time a
   frame is sent.  A link quality level can be updated by maintaining
   the following parameters and statistics at every time a frame is
   received: receive signal strength indication (RSSI), transmission/
   reception rate indication, transmit/receive latency, bit error rate,
   frame error rate and noise level.  Link quality level is divided into
   five levels: EXCELLENT, GOOD, FAIR, BAD, and NONE in descending
   order.  Some parameters can be managed by setting threshold from
   software.  When the parameters cross the threshold, an interrupt is
   generated for the software.

C.2.  L2-PoAList

   In IEEE 802.11 networks, L2-PoAList returns the detected APs which
   quality level exceeds the specified threshold as PoA candidates (by
   the "PoA List" parameter).  Therefore, the MN should always maintain
   the database of available access points according to reception of
   beacon frame, probe response frame and all frames.  This AP database
   is managed in consideration of time, number of frames and signal
   strength.  There are some kinds of network interface hardware that
   can notify events to operating system only when the desired event
   occurs, by setting a threshold from software.  Moreover, the MN can
   transmit the probe request frame for access point discovery, if
   needed.

C.3.  L2-PoAFound

   In IEEE 802.11 networks, L2-PoAFound is notified when new PoAs which
   link quality level exceeds the specified threshold are detected by
   listening beacons or scanning APs.  If the received frame (mainly the
   beacon or the probe response) is not in the AP database described in
   Appendix C.2, then the link layer creates L2-PoAFound.indication.



Teraoka, et al.          Expires August 24, 2007               [Page 27]

Internet-Draft               L2 Abstractions               February 2007


   For example, if the threshold of link quality level specified by L2-
   PoAFound.request is GOOD, the L2-PoAFound.ind is made and sent to the
   upper layer when PoA's link quality becomes stronger than to the
   level of GOOD.

C.4.  L2-PoALost

   In IEEE 802.11 networks, L2-PoALost is notified when an AP included
   in the list of candidate APs is got lost by listening beacons or
   scanning APs.  If the entry in the AP database described in
   Appendix C.2 expires, or link quality level goes under the threshold,
   then the link layer creates L2-PoALost.indication.  To calculate the
   link quality level, the signal strength of the received frame (mainly
   the beacon or the probe response) can be used.  For example, if the
   threshold of the link quality specified by L2-PoALost is BAD, L2-
   PoALost.ind is made and sent to the upper layer when PoA's link
   quality becomes weaker than the level of BAD.

C.5.  L2-LinkUp

   In IEEE 802.11 networks, L2-LinkUp is notified when association or
   reassociation event occurs.  When such event occurs, the MN receives
   the association response frame or the reassociation response frame.
   Immediately after receiving it, the link layer creates L2-
   LinkUp.indication.

C.6.  L2-LinkDown

   In IEEE 802.11 networks, L2-LinkDown is notified when disassociation
   event occurs or when no beacon is received during a certain time.
   When such event occurs, the MN sends the disassociation frame to the
   AP, or the entry of the specific AP is deleted from the AP database
   described in Appendix C.2.  By detecting such events, the link layer
   creates L2-LinkDown.indication.

C.7.  L2-LinkStatusChanged

   In IEEE 802.11 networks, L2-LinkStatusChanged is notified when the
   radio signal strength of the connected AP is going down and becomes
   under the specified threshold.

C.8.  L2-LinkConnect

   In IEEE802.11 networks, each AP is identified by the BSSID and the
   service set of several APs is identified by the SSID.  When L2-
   LinkConnect is used to connect a specific AP or a service set, the
   link layer should set the BSSID or the SSID.  Also, the channel
   should be set appropriately at the same time by searching the

   database described in Appendix C.2.  To connect to the AP, the MN
   should be authenticated by the AP.  The MN sends the authentication
   message to the AP, and then the MN sends the association message to
   associate with the AP.

C.9.  L2-LinkDisconnect

   In IEEE802.11 networks, the MN sends the disassociation message to
   the AP for disconnection.  When L2-LinkDisconnect is used for
   disconnection from the current AP, the link layer should send the
   disassociation message to the appropriate AP, and stop data
   transmission.

Appendix D.  Implementation and Evaluation of the Proposed Model

   This section describes an implementation of the proposed link
   indication architecture and its evaluation.

   An IEEE802.11a wireless LAN device driver was modified to provide
   abstract link layer information in the form of primitives defined in
   Section 4.  The modified driver has two AP lists.  One contains the
   device dependent information such as the RSSI, the retransmission
   count, various AP parameters and various statistics.  The device
   dependent information except for the AP parameters is updated
   whenever the device receives a frame.  If the received frame is the
   management frame, the AP parameters are also updated according to the
   parameters in the frame.

   Another AP list contains the abstract information.  The abstract
   information is updated periodically by using the device dependent
   information.  In the abstraction processing, for example, the RSSI or
   the retransmission count is converted to the common indicator "link
   quality".

   L2-PoAList and L2-LinkStatus were implemented by using only the
   abstract information.  Thus, the upper layers can use information of
   the current AP and the adjacent APs without depending on the devices.
   L2-PoAFound or L2-PoALost is notified if the link quality went up or
   down beyond the thresholds when the abstract information is updated.
   If the link quality of the current AP went down below the specific
   threshold, L2-LinkStatusChanged is notified.  L2-LinkUp or L2-
   LinkDown is notified when an association with an AP is established or
   destroyed.  To realize L2-LinkConnect and L2-LinkDisconnect,
   functions to connect or disconnect to the specified AP were
   implemented.  In these functions, since only abstract information is
   needed to specify the AP, other layers need not to know the device
   dependent information.

   In our outdoor testbed, there are eight ARs, each of which is located
   at a 80-100m interval.  The AP is collocated at the AR.  IEEE802.11a
   was used as the link layer.  The same wireless channel was used at
   all the APs.  Thus there are eight wireless IPv6 subnets in the
   testbed.  The mobile node in a car moved at a speed of 30-40 km/h.
   When link quality of the current AP goes down, the mobile node
   executes L3-driven handover described in Appendix A.  An application
   called DVTS was running on the mobile node and sent digital video
   data at about a 15Mbps data rate through the wireless IPv6 subnet to
   the correspondent node, which replayed received digital video data.
   In this environment, the L2 handover needed less than 1 msec and
   mobility protocol LIN6 [5] needed a few msec for location
   registration.  Thus, the total gap time due to the handover was 3-4

   msec.  In most case, there was no influence to the replayed pictures
   over handover.
