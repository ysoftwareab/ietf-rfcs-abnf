Internet-Draft      Time sync mode in mobile backhaul         April 2009


1.  Introduction

   As the transport network for mobile backhaul has being migrated from
   circuit-switched technology to packet-switched technology such as
   Ethernet, IP/MPLS, packet-switched transport network is expected to
   provide timing and synchronization distribution function as SDH/SONET
   network does.

   In 2G mobile backhaul network (e.g.  GSM), only frequency
   synchronization is needed largely by locking base station clock onto
   a PRC traceable frequency source (i.e.  E1/T1 links).  By
   introduction of 3G cellular system (e.g.  UMTS TDD, CDMA2000, TD-
   SCDMA, WiMAX), base stations need to be aligned each other in phase/
   time in order to guarantee smooth handover. 3G system with TDD mode
   stringently requires micro-second level phase/time synchronization.
   So currently the prevalent way to satisfy this requirement is that
   base station is synchronized to UTC time by installing GPS receiver
   on each of them.  Due to the high cost and security issues, cellular
   operators are seeking solutions to replace or minimize the use of GPS
   and thus to distributes phase/time synchronization through transport
   network to base stations.

   This I-D describes how to transport phase/time employing popular
   packet-based method IEEE Std 1588-2008 i.e.  PTP with support of
   common physical layer method Synchronous Ethernet in a packet-
   switched transport network for mobile backhaul and considerations on
   phase/time transfer protection switching.

3.  Phase/time distribution in packet-switched transport network

   The transport network in mobile backhaul between RNC and base station
   in general comprises aggregation part and access part.  The RNC is
   connected to aggregation equipment (e.g. router or switch) which
   could be selected as time server or Grand Master (GM) in terms of PTP
   protocol.  In this case, the equipment receives the UTC time by
   dedicated time interface (e.g. 1PPS + ToD) from GPS or BITS.  The
   time server distributes time information by PTP interface to RNC and
   downstream equipment respectively.  At the far end, access equipment
   outputs time signal to base station via dedicated time interface
   (e.g. 1PPS + ToD) or synchronizes the base station via PTP interface.

   The later case requires that the base station support PTP protocol.
   The time distribution path from the GM to end equipment is logically
   a tree like topology.

3.1.  Equipment type

   There are basically two types of equipment in the time
   synchronization network, named PTP aware equipment and non-PTP aware
   equipment.  PTP aware equipment includes standalone or integrated
   devices that implement Ordinary clock, Boundary clock, End-to-End
   transparent clock, Peer-to-Peer transparent clock or Management
   nodes.  In this I-D, we focus on application of PTP equipment with
   Ordinary clock and Boundary clock.  Other types of devices would be
   discussed in future.  PTP equipment could enable BMC algorithm and
   each PTP port could be configured to use Delay Request-response
   measurement or Peer Delay measurement.  Non-PTP equipment aware
   refers to switches or routers that deal with PTP packet as general
   data unit.

   Normally, the number of nodes in aggregation network is much smaller
   than that in access network.  So the employment of non-PTP equipment
   in aggregation network, in some respects, avoids the accumulated
   phase error induced by Boundary clock at cost of increasing the
   processing load of GM as well as introducing more PDV.  In real
   network engineering, the PTP packet from GM may traverse some non-PTP
   equipments and is terminated by a Boundary clock at the demarcation
   point of aggregation network and access network.

3.2.  Synchronous Ethernet support

   PTP is based on the idea that master clock periodically adjust slave
   clock by calculating time difference between, compensated by
   transmission delay and node residence delay.  So the frequency
   accuracy and stability of slave clock has considerable impact on the
   performance of PTP system.  If the slave, for example, has local
   clock with frequency accuracy of 1ppm, the generated time offset rate
   will be 1us per second.  This could be unacceptable for design and
   engineering of the network.  In fact, the frequency accuracy of local
   clock has worse freerun or holdover performance than 1ppm in most of
   equipments particularly in access network.  On the other hand, the
   better frequency accuracy makes the slave clock come into steady
   state as soon as possible, i.e. minimize the convergence time of the
   PTP.  The less convergence time is also addressed by operators in
   case time source and/or time synchronization path protection switch
   occurs.

   A possible way to enhance the performance under condition of low
   quality local clock is to increase the sync packet rate of master

   clock in PTP, e.g. 100 or 1000 packet per second, but this would not
   be always effective if the congestion is introduced by intermediate
   non-PTP equipments.  Obviously, the high rate of sync packet brings
   out more bandwidth consumption and spending of CPU resources.

   Alternatively, the Synchronous Ethernet is a physical layer method
   that locks local clock to external stable frequency source or line
   timing signal from frequency synchronization network traceable to
   PRC.  This provides an easy and reliable scheme for the time
   synchronization path to build the PTP operation on well-synchronized
   frequency distribution path.  Each Boundary clock implements
   Synchronous Ethernet function including SSM detection and processing.

3.3.  Building of phase/time synchronization path

   The overview of time synchronization path construction is given by
   the flow chart in figure 1

   Initially, a frequency synchronization path is formed on a link by
   link basis.  The primary frequency source of the backhaul network
   could be the same source of time, e.g. given by GPS.  In this case,
   all PTP equipments (with Ordinary clock or Boundary clock)
   hierarchically follow the frequency output of GM and a tree like
   frequency synchronization path is established from the GM to end
   equipments in the access network.  The frequency source cloud be
   otherwise given from existing synchronization network and/or other
   external frequency source (e.g.  BITS/SSU).  The PTP equipment should
   perform clock source selection among multi frequency sources (e.g.
   recovered line timing from GE or 10GE Synchronous Ethernet links
   and/or external frequency source) by means of SSM detection or pre-
   configuration.  It is noted that, the timing loop in frequency
   synchronization path should be prevented by network engineering or
   some enhanced automatic SSM mechanisms in order to avoid clock
   quality degradation.

   After all nodes clock have entered into locked mode, each NE decides
   the PTP port state according to BMC algorithms.

   O  In general case, the frequency reference source and the phase/time
      source are colocated in backhaul network.  So the frequency
      distribution path and the phase/time distribution path could be
      congruent.  Consenquently, slave port of PTP BC could be simply
      selected as the port from which the timing signal is received and
      selected as reference frequency source.  When multi phase/time
      sources exist and seperate from frequency source, the BMC chooses
      the best master clock from set of priorities and thus logically
      selects the only PTP slave port.

   O  Particularly, if the frequency reference source of the node is
      coming from any external clock (e.g. fed by BITS/SSU), the PTP
      slave port is decided by BMC.

   O  If the node enters into holdover mode or before it locks/relocks
      to certain frequency reference source, time holdover steps in and
      PTP will neither change the port state nor receive and send sync
      packets until frequency stable state is recovered.

   On the other hand, if a PTP port is not capable of recovering
   frequency from line timing, the port should syntonize the local clock
   by using receiving PTP message and complete phase/time alighment
   based on the tuned clock.

4.  Phase/time distribution path switch

   To show the relationship between time distribution path and frequency
   distribution path, and also the switch process of each, figure 2 and
   figure 3 are given below.  In figure 2, PTP equipment A, B, C, D, E
   and F are interconnected by Synchronous Ethernet links in a ring
   topology.  The time and frequency reference source of the network are
   co-located.  The port I of each node is set to priority 1, the port
   II of each node is set to priority 2 in accordance with ITU-T G.781.
   Each node selects frequency reference source based on SSM code in QL-
   enabled mode as defined in ITU-T G.8264 and G.781.  The frequency
   distribution path is indicated by flow arrows when all nodes are in
   locked mode.  Port III of node A is configured as PTP slave port and
   port I and II are configured as PTP master port.  Other nodes assign
   the PTP port state by above given rules.  In this example, no PTP
   port is assigned as passive state.  Finally, the time distribution
   path is formed congruent with frequency distribution path.

   Figure 3 shows the case when the link between node E and node F is
   broken.  Time distribution path stays unchanged but node E enters
   into time holdover and stop transmitting PTP message at master port.
   At the same time, node E sends SSM code DNU to inform node D to
   switch the frequency source.  When node D finishes clock source
   switch, node E will follow line timing from port II of node D. At
   last, node D and node E re-entered into locked mode, thus a new
   frequency distribution path is built indicated by flow arrows.  The
   PTP port state of node D and node E are consequently switched.  Time
   transfer restores with the new time distribution path along rebuilt
   frequency distribution path.
