   Figure 1 shows an example of interworking between flexible and fixed
   grid nodes.  Node A, B, D, E support flexible grid.  All these nodes
   can support frequency slots with central frequency granularity of
   6.25 GHz and slotwidth granularity of 12.5 GHz.  At the same time,
   the channel spacing and slotwidth can be configured to integral
   multiple of 6.25 GHz and 12.5 GHz respectively.  As shown in figure
   2, they are backward compatible to the fixed grid situation (flexible
   frequency slot with channel spacing of 8*6.25 and slotwidth of 4*12.5
   GHz is equivalent to fixed-grid DWDM channel with channel spacing of
   50 GHz).  As node C can only support the fixed grid DWDM property
   with channel spacing of 50 GHz, to establish a LSP through node
   B,C,D, the links between B to C and C to D must set to align with the
   fixed grid values.  This link grid property must be negotiated before
   establishing the LSP.
