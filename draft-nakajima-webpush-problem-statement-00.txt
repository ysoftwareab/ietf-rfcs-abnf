              draft-nakajima-webpush-problem-statement-00

Abstract

   The Web Push protocol provides a means of delivering the events to
   clients based on the registration made by the application.  Also, the
   emergency alert notification system has been developed and deployed
   widely with mobile phones or smartphones, but has not deployed to
   Web-only devices.

   This document outlines various existing emergency alert notification
   system in other protocols and use cases with their requirements.

1.  Introduction

   The delivery of real-time events such as incoming calls or messages
   is an essential feature of mobile application and its platform.  The
   Web Push [I-D.thomson-webpush-http2] protocol has been proposed to
   enable delivering the events required by W3C Web Push API [PushAPI].

   Also, emergency alerting is an apparently important feature of
   telecommunication network such as cellular networks, allowing the
   governments or authorities to send a warnings of natural disaster or
   accident.

   This document will describe various use cases and requirements of
   emergency notification system using Web Push.

2.  Terminology

   In cases where normative language needs to be emphasized, this
   document back on established shorthands for expressing
   interoperability requirements on implementations: the capitalized
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD" and "MAY".  The meaning of these
   is described in [RFC2119].

3.1.  Issues on existing emergency alerting system

   This section describes the survey and issues of existing emergency
   alerting system.

   In the cellular network, several emergency alerting mechanisms have
   been proposed and merged into Public Warning System(PWS)
   [_3GPP.22.268].  PWS provides several functions for example:

   o  Able to broadcast Warning notifications to multiple devices
      simultaneously.

   o  Able to broadcast Warning notifications based on geographical
      information.

   o  Provides reliable, secure delivery of Warning notification over
      3GPP system.

   Addition to PWS, some work has been made to distribute the emergency
   alerting notification on different network.  In the WiFi network,
   IEEE 802.11u [IEEE80211u] has an emergency support which uses Common
   Alerting Protocol (CAP) [CAP].  Also, Atoca WG has worked for
   defining the secure alerting format to broadcast CAP-based alert over
   IP network.

   Those previous contributions have been made to develop the method to
   distribute an emergency alerting notification.  However, those
   systems require a specific access network such as 3GPP or WiFi.
   There is an issue that desktop device or device not equipped with
   3GPP or WiFi is not able to receive an emergency alerting
   notification.

   The second issue is geolocation-aware system.  A major emergency
   alert such as an earthquake or a tsunami is distributed at
   geolocation specific area based on the cellular cell or WiFi cell.
   Web Push relies on HTTP/2 [I-D.ietf-httpbis-http2] which relies on IP
   network.  Geofencing [Geofencing] is discussed in W3C Geolocation WG
   to let the application to interact with the loose location-aware
   computation without knowing device's exact location.  However,
   geofencing needs device's support, Web Push emergency alerting
   notification system has to have a mechanism to detect device's
   location to send a location specific alerts.

3.2.  Use case of Web Push Emergency Alerting Notification

   There are two potential use case of Web Push Emergency Alerting
   notification.

   The first use case is a Web-based Signage.  Digital signage has
   widely deployed among the world.  Signages located at public area
   such as train station or street play a significant role in natural
   disaster or accident by providing the evacuation alert or correct
   informations.  Recent few years W3C worked on Web-based signage which
   has Web browser is embedded, allowing to display or play Web content.
   Disaster use case is proposed in W3C Web-based Signage Scenarios and
   Use Cases [SignageUseCase].

   The second use case is an over-the-top emergency alerting system
   operated by a local authorities or a government.  An emgergency
   alerting of an major natural disaster such as an earthquake or a
   tsunami could be distributed by existing emergency alerting system
   (e.g.  PWS).  However, distributing an emergency alerting of an minor
   natual disaster such as heavy rain alert using existing method is too
   complicated compared to the importance of the information or alert.
   Web Push emergency alerting notification can provide more specific
   alert or information requested by the mobile or desktop application
   not requiring 3GPP or WiFi network.  For example:

   o  Raining alert based on the location

   o  Transit alert such as accident information or suspend.

3.3.  Non-emergency, Important notification

   Non-emergency but important notification is required to real-time
   applications.  Real-time application such as VoIP or
   telecommunication application, need to deliver the notification
   faster than other notification.

4.  Security Consideration

   Discovery of Push Server and application is out of scope in this
   document.  However, discovery of reliable Push Server and application
   is definitely important.  Also, it is important for Web Push
   Emergency Alerting notification to have a mechanism to avoid the
   abuse of system.

5.  IANA Consideration

   TBD
