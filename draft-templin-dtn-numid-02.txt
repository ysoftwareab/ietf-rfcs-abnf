             Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) Numeric Node IDs
                     draft-templin-dtn-numid-02.txt

Abstract

   The Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) Bundle Protocol (BP) uses Uniform
   Resource Identifiers (URIs) as the basis for Endpoint and Node IDs.
   IDs that are encoded as long alphanumeric strings can consume
   precious bandwidth over constrained links, leading to a desire for a
   concise numeric ID format.  This document discusses design
   alternatives for DTN numeric node IDs.

1.  Introduction

   The Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) Bundle Protocol (BP)
   [I-D.ietf-dtn-bpbis] uses Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)
   [RFC3968] as the basis for Endpoint IDs (EIDs) in the following
   format:

   < scheme name > : < scheme-specific part, or "SSP" >

   When the scheme name is "dtn", the SSP is an alphanumeric EID string
   up to 1023 octets in length.  Since each Bundle may include several
   such EIDs, this could result in substantial bandwidth consumption
   over constrained links simply to transport EIDs, leading to a desire
   for a concise numeric format.

   When the scheme name is "ipn", the SSP is a numeric node number
   (between 1 and 2^64 - 1) followed by a numeric service number
   (between 0 and 2^64 - 1) [RFC6260].  Values for these fields are
   registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and/or
   delegated to independent registries such as the Space Assigned
   Numbers Authority (SANA) [RFC7116].

   This document discusses the "ipn" scheme, and presents candidate
   requirements for alternate DTN numeric node ID schemes.

2.1.  IPN Naming Scheme

   [RFC6260] and [RFC7116] define a numeric naming scheme used to form
   EIDs that in native representation take the form of Uniform Record
   Identifiers with scheme name "ipn".  The native representation of an
   "ipn" EID is: "ipn:<node_number>.<service_number>".

   More formally, the "ipn" scheme is defined in the Augmented Backus-
   Naur Form (ABNF) notation of [RFC5234], including the core ABNF
   syntax rule for DIGIT defined by that specification.  Details are:

   o  ipn-uri = "ipn:" ipn-hier-part

   o  ipn-hier-part = node-nbr nbr-delim service-nbr ; a path-rootless

   o  node-nbr = 1*DIGIT

   o  nbr-delim = "."

   o  service-nbr = 1*DIGIT.

   Because the encoded representation of an ipn-scheme URI's ipn-hier-
   part is so compact, EIDs expressed in this scheme are suitable for
   resource-constrained links, however administrative entities that are
   first to claim the lower node numbers for assignment to their nodes
   may have a permanent performance advantage.  In particular, [RFC7116]
   specifies the initial ipn EID assignments shown below:

      +--------------------+---------------------------+---------------+
      |              Value | Description               | Reference     |
      +--------------------+---------------------------+---------------+
      |                  0 | Reserved                  | This document |
      |       1--(2**14)-1 | Unassigned                | This document |
      | (2**14)--(2**21)-1 | Allocated to CCSDS (SANA) | This document |
      | (2**21)--(2**28)-1 | Private/Experimental Use  | This document |
      | (2**28)--(2**42)-1 | Unassigned                | This document |
      |          >=(2**42) | Reserved                  | This document |
      +--------------------+---------------------------+---------------+

   Using octet-based encodings such as CBOR [I-D.burleigh-dtn-rs-cbor],
   this means that EIDs allocated to CCSDS can be represented in 2-3
   octets, Private/Experimental Use EIDs can be represented in 3-4
   octets and Unassigned/Reserved EIDs require 4 or more octets.  This
   means that in a first-come, first-served assignment policy the
   earliest adopters will receive EIDs that can be represented in fewer
   octets than those received by latecomers.The "ipn" scheme further
   does not address all of the requirements that would be expected of
   addressing schemes such as those defined for the Internet Protocol,

   but it is necessary to consider which (if any) of the additional
   requirements would be applicable to DTN.  The following section
   therefore discusses requirements for alternate numeric naming schemes
   for DTN, if indeed an alternate scheme is even necessary.

2.2.  Alternate Numeric Naming Schemes

   It is clear that the "ipn" scheme is already operational; hence, if
   one or more new scheme names are needed they would require a new
   scheme name.  Some of the questions that must be taken into
   consideration in designing an alternate numeric naming scheme
   include:

   Q1 (Fixed vs Variable-length):  Should an alternate scheme include a
      fixed-length EID format, or variable-length to allow efficient
      codings for early adopters?

   Q2: (Pseudo-Random vs. Consecutive Assignments):  Should an alternate
      scheme delegate EIDs in a (pseudo) random fashion to ensure
      fairness, or as consecutive values beginning with low numbers and
      growing proportionally to the number of allocations?

   Q3 (Maximum EID Length):  "ipn" specifies a maximum EID length of 64
      bits.  Should an alternate scheme adopt the same maximum length?

   Q4 (Unicast EIDs):  Should an alternate scheme include a range of
      EIDs that correspond to singleton DTN nodes?

   Q5 (Multicast EIDs):  Should an alternate scheme include a range of
      EIDs that correspond to groups of DTN nodes for which all nodes in
      the group receive the bundle?  If so, should the multicast EIDs be
      part of the same naming scheme as unicast EIDs, or should they be
      part of a different scheme?

   Q6 (Private-use EIDs):  Should an alternate scheme include a range of
      EIDs that can be administratively assigned within the local DTN,
      even though the same EIDs may be assigned in other DTNs?  If so,
      should the private-use EIDs be assigned from low-numbered values
      so that efficient coding compression can be employed?

   Q7 (Universal EIDs):  Should an alternate scheme include a range of
      EIDs that are guaranteed to be unique on a universal basis, e.g.,
      in case one or more DTNs merge to form a larger DTN?

   Q8 (Block Allocations vs. Individual Allocations):  Should an
      alternate scheme allow for "block allocations" of EIDs, or only
      individual allocations (i.e., one EID at a time)?  If block

Internet-Draft            DTN Numeric Node IDs                 July 2016


      allocations are supported, should the blocks include contiguous
      EID values, or (pseudo) random values?

   It is further worth considering that any DTN numeric naming scheme
   (or schemes) would entail compromises that might not be a best-fit
   for all applications.  For example, the IPv6 addressing architecture
   [RFC4291] specifies a fixed 16-octet address length which might
   present considerable overhead for transporting addresses across slow
   links.  In the end, any new DTN numeric naming scheme would need to
   be analyzed according to specific use cases.
