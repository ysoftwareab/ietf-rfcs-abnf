1. Introduction

   This document defines low level monitoring and status MIBs for IPsec
   security associations (SAs). It does not define MIBs that may be used
   for configuring IPsec implementations or for providing low-level
   diagnostic or debugging information. It assumes no specific use of
   IPsec. Further, it does not provide policy information.

   The purpose of the MIBs is to allow system administrators to
   determine operating conditions and perform system operational level
   monitoring of the IPsec portion of their network. Statistics are
   provided as well. Additionally, it may be used as the basis for
   application specific MIBs for specific uses of IPsec SAs.


2. The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

   o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
       purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
       Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD
       16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215
       [RFC1215]. The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD
       58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and RFC 2580
       [RFC2580].

   o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
       first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second version of the
       SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
       protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901]
       and RFC 1906 [RFC1906]. The third version of the message protocol
       is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906], RFC 2572
       [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

   o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
       first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second set of protocol
       operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
       [RFC1905].

   o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [RFC2573]
       and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
       [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine-readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine-
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.


2.1 Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI. In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name. The object type
   together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object. For human convenience, we often
   use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the object
   type.


3. Definitions


3.1 Security Association

   These MIBs use the RFC 2401 [ISAKMP] Section 4.1 identification of a
   security association (SA).

     "A security association is uniquely identified by a triple
     consisting of a Security Parameter Index (SPI), an IP Destination
     Address, and a security protocol (AH or ESP) identifier."

   As such, an SA in these MIBs is a unidirectional entity. IKE
   negotiates these in pairs, outbound and inbound.

   For IPcomp [IPCOMP] SAs, a CPI (Compression Parameter Index) replaces
   the SPI.


3.2 Inbound

   In the inbound direction, a packet crosses an interface of a logical
   or physical entity and enters the entity. No assumption is made about
   what happens to the packet after it enters the entity.

   An inbound SA then is an SA that processes inbound packets at an
   interface.


3.3 Outbound

   In the outbound direction, a packet crosses an interface of a logical
   or physical entity and leaves the entity. No assumption is made about
   the origins of the packet before it exits the entity.

   An outbound SA then is an SA that processes outbound packets at an
   interface.


4. IPsec MIB Objects Architecture

   The IPsec MIB consists of tables for the display of raw IPsec
   security associations (SAs), some entity statistics and traps.
   Configuration about the SAs is provided as are statistics related to
   the SAs themselves. However, no ability is provided to configure the
   SAs themselves.

   The intent is that these MIBs may be used by any entity that somehow
   creates IPsec SAs. That creation mechanism can be IKE, static
   configuration or some other key exchange protocol.

   System administrators may use the traps to help detect mis-
   configurations or possible attacks.


4.1 IPsec Security Association Tables

   Due to the definition of the identification of an SA (see
   Section 3.1), individual SAs in these MIBs are indexed by the
   equivalent three objects, where the security protocol is implicit by
   the SA's appearance in a particular table. Further, for the purposes
   of these MIBs, IPcomp is considered a security protocol.

   Individual IPsec phase 2 SAs are separated by both direction and
   security protocol, resulting in the creation of six separate tables.

   All tables contain common information, such as the selectors and
   expiration limits, in addition to protocol specific information. The
   selectors are important objects with respect to phase 2 SAs and can
   be shared across multiple SAs, so there is a table of SA selectors.

   The SAs in the tables may have been statically created, created by
   IKE or by some other mechanism.

   When SAs expire, they are removed from the table. There is no SA
   history kept with the exception of some global counters.


4.1.1 Phase 2 Selector Table

   This table provides a list of SA selectors. This table is arbitrarily
   indexed. It contains the local phase 2 ID, then the remote phase 2
   ID, a layer 4 protocol number, and finally the local and remote layer
   4 port numbers.

   The SA table uses entries in this table.


4.1.2 IPcomp Security Associations

   For IPcomp SAs, the following assumptions are made:
  o  IPcomp SAs don't care about policy errors.

  o  IPcomp SAs don't care about expiration.

  o  The selector can be empty (0) if IPcomp is shared across multiple
     security association suites. This may happen if an implementation
     chooses to use a CPI in the range of 1 to 63, representing the
     specific compression protocol chosen.

  o  There are no transmission errors; an outbound SA will send packets
     uncompressed if it is unable to compress them for any reason.

  o  The outbound SA also makes decisions about which packets are
     compressed or not compressed.

  o  Packets which were not compressed by an outbound IPcomp SA are
     still passed to an inbound IPcomp SA for processing when the
     IPcomp SA is part of a security association suite. This is for
     accounting purposes only, and is not intended to force any
     particular implementation.

   A compression performance metric can be calculated for IPcomp SAs by
   dividing the SAs' output traffic counter value by the SAs' input
   traffic counter.

   Also provided for IPcomp SAs are the total number of packets and
   traffic that was compressed. The total for packets that were not
   compressed can be calculated using the available objects.


4.2 IPsec MIB Traps

   Traps are provided to let system administrators know about the
   existence of error conditions occurring in the entity. These errors
   are associated with operational errors and may also indicate the
   presence of attacks on the system.

   Traps are not provided when SAs come up or go down.

   Traps may also be enabled or disabled as required, using configurable
   configuration objects. Note that support for these objects is
   optional, so that system administrators that have concerns about SNMP
   security can choose to implement objects that are write-only.


4.3 IPsec Entity Level Objects

   This part of the MIB carries statistics global to the IPsec device.
   Statistics included are aggregate numbers of SAs and aggregate errors
   for SAs.

6. Security Considerations

   This MIB contains readable objects whose values provide information
   related to IPsec SAs. While some of the information is readily
   available by monitoring the traffic into an entity, other information
   may provide attackers with more information than an administrator may
   desire.

   Some of the specific concerns are related to the display of the
   algorithms and key lengths associated with encryption, and the
   feedback of error counters and traps that enable an attacker to
   quickly determine the effect of his or her attacks.

   Specific examples of this include, but are not limited to:

  o  Replay counts that tell attackers that replay values are being
     checked, and what the current window is.

  o  Specific algorithms and key lengths are displayed, giving
     attackers a better idea of how to attack.

  o  Specific traffic counts, giving attackers more information for
     traffic analysis.

   Of particular concern is the ability to disable the transmission of
   traps. The traps defined in this MIB may appear due to badly
   configured systems and transient error conditions, but they may also
   appear due to attacks. If an attacker can disable these traps, they
   reduce some of the warnings that may be provided to system
   administrators.

   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them
   over the network via SNMP. Not all versions of SNMP provide features
   for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-
   based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.

   This document is based in part on an earlier proposal titled "draft-
   ietf-ipsec-mib-xx.txt". That series was abandoned, since it included
   application specific constructs in addition to the IPsec only
   objects.

   Portions of the original document's origins were based on the working
