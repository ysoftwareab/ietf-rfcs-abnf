      Inter-Destination Media Synchronizaton for IPTV Environments
              draft-stokking-avtcore-idms-for-iptv-00.txt

Abstract

   [RFC7272] describes the use of RTCP for the purpose of Inter-
   Destination Media Synchronization (IDMS) between Synchronization
   Clients (SCs) and an Media Synchronization Application Server (MSAS).
    This document extends that work for application in the area of IPTV.
    First, RTCP can be used according to the single source multicast
   (SSM) principles from [RFC5760] in the IPTV application area.  This
   document specifies the use of a feedback target for collecting and
   possibly summarizing IDMS reports.  For this, the document defines 2
   new sub-report blocks for the use of IDMS according to the SSM
   principles.  Alternatively, the MSAS can be co-located with the
   Feedback Target, for synchronizing small groups of receivers. 
   Secondly, in an IPTV environment, different viewers may receive the
   same content, but in non-identical streams.  The IDMS solution
   presented in [RFC7272] will no longer work in such a case.  This
   document provides a solution for this.

1.  Introduction

   The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) provides a real-time transport
   mechanism suitable for unicast and multicast communication between
   multimedia applications.  An important component of the RTP protocol
   is the control channel, defined as the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP). 
   RTP and RTCP have been extended in numerous RFCs.  Two such
   extensions are the extensions for Single-Source Multicast (SSM)
   Sessions with Unicast Feedback in [RFC5760] and the use of RTCP for
   Inter-Destination Media Synchronization (IDMS) in [RFC7272].

   This Internet draft provides a number of extensions on the use of
   RTCP for IDMS in an IPTV environment.  The IPTV environment has a
   number of characteristics that are currently not dealt with
   [RFC7272].  The introduction discusses the IPTV environment  and
   identifies various gaps in the current IDMS solution.  The next
   sections discuss solution directions for dealing with these gaps. 
   The purpose of this Internet Draft is to build upon [RFC7272] so that
   the IDMS solution can be applied in an IPTV specific environment.

1.1.  IDMS in an IPTV environment

   An IPTV environment has specific characteristics, which [RFC7272]
   does not deal with properly.  These characteristics are:

   o  Single Source Multicast (SSM, [RFC5760]) setting with a large
   number of viewers.

   o  Different receivers may receive different versions of the same
      content, i.e. they receive non-identical streams, e.g. different
      unicast streams, different encoded streams, streams from different
      media senders.

1.1.1.  IDMS for Single Source Multicast

   The first characteristic of IPTV is the large-scale Single Source
   Multicast (SSM) setting.  Regular linear television is offered using
   SSM.  Such SSM sessions have a large number of viewers, often in the
   millions, which requires a highly scalable approach.  Applying IDMS
   to such an SSM session can be done in two ways:

   1.  Synchronize all receivers.  In this case, [RFC7272] does not
   offer the scalability to synchronize all viewers in such large-scale
   sessions.  In such a case each receiver contains a synchronization
   client (SC) which communicates with the Media Synchronization
   Application Server (MSAS).[RFC5760] offers a unicast feedback system
   using feedback targets (FTs) to collect and possibly aggregate RTCP
   reports of groups of receivers.  IDMS can be performed using this

   same feedback system, providing more scalability.  Section 2 of this
   document specifies how to accomplish this.

   2.  Synchronize independent groups of receivers, depending on the
   application.  Use cases for synchronization, such as social TV or
   such as multiple receivers in a single physical location, require
   only a limited number of receivers to be synchronized together.  For
   example, when millions of viewers watch the same television show,
   only specific groups of users viewing the show together would have to
   be synchronized, and only within their own group.  [RFC5760]
   describes a system that provides all receivers with the same
   information.  If only a limited subset of the receivers are
   synchronized together, not all receivers need to receive the same
   synchronization instructions.  Section 3 of this document provides a
   unicast way of sending synchronization instructions to receivers,
   which requires the MSAS to be co-located with the Feedback Target.

   The choice between options 1 and 2 depends on a number of factors. 
   If only a limited number of receivers use a service that requires
   IDMS, it is inefficient to synchronize all viewers.  Also, playout
   timing differences between various receivers can be relatively large
   due to e.g. variable propagation delays.  If that is the case, and
   every receiver is synchronizing to the slowest receiver, a lot of
   buffering needs to be done.  This is not efficient, and also
   significantly increases channel changing delays.  In these cases, it
   makes sense to use option 2.  If on the other hand many viewers use
   synchronization sensitive services, and playout timing differences
   are relatively small, it may make sense to synchronize all receivers
   by using option 1.

1.1.2.  IDMS for different streams providing the same content

   Different viewers may watch the same content, but use a different
   media stream in an IPTV environment.  An example of this is when one
   viewer receives an High Definition (HD) stream and another viewer
   receives an Standard Definition (SD) stream.  Another example is when
   multiple receivers view the same video-on-demand, receiving this
   using different unicast streams.  Services such as social TV, where
   different viewers remotely view media content together, require
   synchronization of these different streams.  The IDMS solution is
   based on RTP timestamps.  For different streams, these timestamps are
   not aligned, i.e. there is no relation between the timestamps in one
   stream and the timestamps in another stream, because of the different
   random offset of the RTP timestamps, as well as potential clock skew.
    Because of this, the MSAS cannot determine proper synchronization
   instructions.

   There are two possible solution directions for this problem.
 


Stokking, et al.         Expires April 30, 2015                 [Page 4]

   The first is to have the media source output the different streams
   with the same timing.  The NTP timestamp in the RTP packets will then
   be synchronous, i.e. IDMS can be based on this NTP timestamp analogue
   to inter-stream synchronization (lip-sync).  This does require the
   MSAS to be informed on the RTP/NTP relationships of the various
   streams.  This information is available in the RTCP SRs of the
   various streams.  If the MSAS is part of the media source, this is
   implicitly available.  If this is not the case, the MSAS should
   receive these SRs somehow.  This document presents various options to
   achieve this.

   The other solution for this problem, is to have the media source
   determine and signal the relationship between the various RTP
   timestamps of the various streams.  Again, if the MSAS is part of
   with the media source, then this information is locally available. 
   If the MSAS is a separate entity, the media source can sent this
   information to the MSAS.  Section 4 of this document shows how that
   is done.

2.  IDMS report aggregation in SSM session

   [RFC5760] describes how to use Feedback Targets (FTs) or the
   Distribution Source (DS)for summarizing RTCP packets from receivers,
   using the Receiver Summary Information (RSI) Packet.  This section
   describes two new sub-report blocks, to be used in those RSI packets.
    One sub-report block is for summarizing reported RTP packet received
   timestamps, the other is for summarizing reported RTP packet
   presented timestamps.

   A feedback target or distribution source MUST only summarize IDMS
   information from SCs, if they belong to the same synchronization
   group, i.e. when the reports from the receivers contain the same
   Media Stream Correlation Identifier [RFC7272].  If at least one of
   the receivers in a certain synchronization group reports on both
   packet received timestamps and packet presented timestamps, a
   feedback target or distribution source SHOULD also include packet
   presented timestamps.  If all receivers report on packet presented
   timestamps, a feedback target or distribution source MUST include
   packet presented timestamps.  If a feedback target or distribution
   source summarizes the packet received timestamps, it SHOULD also
   summarize the packet presented timestamps.

2.1.  IDMS Packet Received Sub-Report Block

   To summarize the packet received timestamps in the IDMS information
   from SCs, a feedback target or distribution source can use the
   following sub-report block.  The name of this sub-report block is
   "IDMS Received", the long name is "IDMS Packet Received NTP

   Packet Received NTP Timestamp - Maximum Distribution Value: 64 bits,

   Distribution Buckets: each bucket has ((Length * 4) - 28) * 8 / NDB
   bits.

   The whole sub-report block contains only a single packet received RTP
   timestamp value.  Since various receivers will normally report on
   different packet received RTP timestamps, a feedback target MUST
   recalculate all packet received NTP timestamps to match the single
   packet received RTP timestamp.  This will give an overview of the
   packet received times of all receivers for that specific RTP
   timestamp.  This recalculation is necessary for all reported
   timestamps: minimum, maximum and those in the distribution buckets.

2.2.  IDMS Packet Presented Sub-Report Block

   To summarize the packet presented timestamps in the IDMS information
   from SCs, a feedback target or distribution source can use the
   following sub-report block.  The name of this sub-report block is
   "IDMS Presented", the long name is "IDMS Packet Presented NTP
   Timestamp".

   as defined in [RFC7272].

   Distribution Buckets: each bucket has ((Length * 4) - 28) * 8 / NDB
   bits.

   The whole sub-report block contains only a single packet received RTP
   timestamp value.  Since various receivers will report on different
   packet presented NTP timestamps, a feedback target MUST recalculate
   all packet presented NTP timestamps to match the single packet
   received RTP timestamp.  This is true for all reported timestamps:
   minimum, maximum and those in the distribution buckets.

3.  IDMS with separate MSAS with unicast synchronization settings

   The second alternative for IDMS in a large-scale SSM context is to
   synchronize small groups of receivers that need to be synchronized
   with each other because of the service requirements.  Different
   groups may still receive the same RTP streams, but can be
   synchronized independent of each other.  In that case, each group
   MUST receive its own synchronization settings instructions in the
   form of IDMS Settings Packets as defined in [RFC7272].  Normally the
   Receiver Reports (RRs) or the Received Summary Information (RSI) is
   sent to all receivers.  But, since different groups of receivers may
   need different synchronization settings instructions, these
   instructions cannot be multicast.  As it happens, multicasting all
   instructions would lead to a situation where all receivers would
   receive a multitude of different settings instructions.  They would
   have to find their own instructions based on the MSCI of their group,
   which is possible.  But, with a large number of groups, this would be
   highly inefficient.  This is why a unicast method is taken here.

   To unicast the instructions to the various SCs, the MSAS needs to
   directly receive the IDMS reports from the various SCs.  This means
   the MSAS MUST be co-located with the feedback target.  When supplying
   SCs with the unicast address to which they should sent their reports,
   different SCs in the same synchronization group MUST be allocated the
   same feedback target.  Also, because the synchronization information
   is no longer relevant upstream of the MSAS, the feedback target
   SHOULD terminate these RTCP blocks and not forward them or summarize
   them.

   How the receivers receive the unicast address of the feedback target
   is out of scope of this draft.  [RFC5760] only defines pre-
   configuration for this.  Alternatively, the RTCP-attribute as
   specified in [RFC3605] can be used on the session level to provide
   receivers of a shared session with the unicast address of the MSAS,
   similar to how this is done in [TS183063].

   Synchronization settings instructions MUST be sent by the MSAS to the
   source IP addresses of the received synchronization information,
   using the same destination port as the received synchronization
   information.

4.  IDMS in case of multiple RTP streams

   IDMS is based on various receivers reporting on the packet received
   times or packet presentation times.  This document describes
   situations in which the MSAS is not part of the media source.  If all
   receivers receive the exact same RTP streams, e.g. in case of
   multiple receivers of a single multicast streams, this will work
   fine.  The MSAS can relate the various received IDMS information. 
   Even if different receivers report on different RTP timestamps, the
   MSAS can calculate the timing differences between clients by
   extrapolation using the RTP clock frequency derived from the reported
   payload type.

   However, when the MSAS is not co-located with the media source and
   the receivers receive the same content in different RTP streams, an
   MSAS cannot perform the necessary calculations for achieving
   synchronization.  To perform these calculations, there has to exist
   some common timeline in the reports by the various receivers.  To
   determine a common timeline, the MSAS needs some kind of information
   correlating the RTP timestamps in the various streams.  This section
   provides two alternatives for this.

   The first alternative is to use the RTCP Sender Reports that belong
   to the various RTP streams.  In these SRs, the RTP timestamps are
   linked to the employed wallclock time.  This is normally used for
   intra- and inter-media synchronization.  The media sources need to
   ensure that the same part of the content in different streams
   corresponds to the same wallclock time (NTP timestamp in the SR). 
   This way the SRs of the various RTP streams can be used to establish
   a common timeline between those RTP streams.  The easiest way to send
   the SR to the MSAS is by having the receiver append it to its report
   blocks.  Another option is to have the MSAS act as a third party
   monitor, as described in [RFC3550].

   The second alternative is that the media source sends information on
   the correlation of the various timestamps to the MSAS.  This can be
   done by using the IDMS report block from [RFC7272], using the
   Synchronization Packet Sender Types (SPST) 3 and 4, as specified in
   [TS183063] Annex W, and registered with IANA in the IDMS XR Block
   SPST Registry.  These SPSTs are normally used for synchronization in
   case a transcoder is changing the media stream such that the RTP
   timestamps also change.  In this case, synchronization would be
   impossible between users receiving the original stream and users

   receiving the transcoded version. A transcoder can link an incoming
   RTP timestamps (SPST=3) to an outgoing RTP timestamp (SPST=4), and
   thus enable correlating the timelines.  These SPSTs 3 and 4 can also
   be used if one source sends out two version of the same content,
   linking the timestamps of one stream to those of the other stream.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines two new RSI Sub-Report Blocks, the "IDMS
   Received" and the "IDMS Presented".  Based on the specification in
   section 2, these two sub-report blocks are added to the IANA registry
   for Sub-Report Block Type (SRBT) Values for the RSI Packet, as part
   of the RTP parameters registration.

6.  Security Considerations

   The content of this ID does not pose any security risks above or
   beyond those mentioned in [RFC5760] and [RFC7272].
