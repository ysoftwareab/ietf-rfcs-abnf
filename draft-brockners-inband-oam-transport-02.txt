                  Encapsulations for In-situ OAM Data
                draft-brockners-inband-oam-transport-02

Abstract

   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) records
   operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet
   traverses a path between two points in the network.  In-situ OAM is
   to complement current out-of-band OAM mechanisms based on ICMP or
   other types of probe packets.  This document outlines how in-situ OAM
   data records can be transported in protocols such as NSH, Segment
   Routing, VXLAN-GPE, native IPv6 (via extension headers), and IPv4.
   Transport options are currently investigated as part of an
   implementation study.  This document is intended to only serve
   informational purposes.

Internet-Draft         In-situ OAM Data Transport           October 2016


1.  Introduction

   This document discusses transport mechanisms for "in-situ"
   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) data records.  In-
   situ OAM records OAM information within the packet while the packet
   traverses a particular network domain.  The term "in-situ" refers to
   the fact that the OAM data is added to the data packets rather than
   is being sent within packets specifically dedicated to OAM.  A
   discussion of the motivation and requirements for in-situ OAM can be
   found in [I-D.brockners-inband-oam-requirements].  Data types and
   data formats for in-situ OAM are defined in
   [I-D.brockners-inband-oam-data].

   This document outlines transport encapsulations for the in-situ OAM
   data defined in [I-D.brockners-inband-oam-data].  This document is to
   serve informational purposes only.  As part of an in-situ OAM
   implementation study different protocol encapsulations for in-situ
   OAM data are being explored.  Once data formats and encapsulation
   approaches are settled, protocol specific specifications for in-situ
   OAM data transport will address the standardization aspect.

   The data for in-situ OAM defined in [I-D.brockners-inband-oam-data]
   can be carried in a variety of protocols based on the deployment
   needs.  This document discusses transport of in-situ OAM data for the
   following protocols:

   o  IPv6

   o  IPv4

   o  VXLAN-GPE

   o  NSH

   o  Segment Routing (IPv6 and MPLS)

   This list is non-exhaustive, as it is possible to carry the in-situ
   OAM data in several other protocols and transports.

   A feasibility study of in-situ OAM is currently underway as part of
   the FD.io project [FD.io].  The in-situ OAM implementation study
   should be considered as a "tool box" to showcase how "in-situ" OAM
   can complement probe-packet based OAM mechanisms for different
   deployments and packet transport formats.  For details, see the open
   source code in the FD.io [FD.io].

3.  In-Situ OAM Metadata Transport in IPv6

   This mechanisms of in-situ OAM in IPv6 complement others proposed to
   enhance diagnostics of IPv6 networks, such as the IPv6 Performance
   and Diagnostic Metrics Destination Option described in
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-6man-pdm-option].  The IP Performance and Diagnostic
   Metrics Destination Option is destination focused and specific to
   IPv6, whereas in-situ OAM is performed between end-points of the
   network or a network domain where it is enabled and used.

   A historical note: The idea of IPv6 route recording was originally
   introduced by [I-D.kitamura-ipv6-record-route] back in year 2000.
   With IPv6 now being generally deployed and new concepts such as
   Segment Routing [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing] being introduced,
   it is imperative to further mature the Operations, Administration,
   and Maintenance mechanisms available to IPv6 networks.

   The in-situ OAM options translate into options for an IPv6 extension
   header.  The extension header would be inserted by either a host
   source of the packet, or by a transit/domain-edge node.  If the
   addition of the in-situ OAM Hop-by-Hop Option header would lead to
   the packet exceeding the MTU of the domain an error should be
   reported.  The methods and procedures of how the error is reported

   are outside the scope of this document.  Likewise if an ICMPv6
   forwarding error occurs between encapsulating and decapsulating
   nodes, the node generating the ICMPv6 error should strip the in-situ
   OAM Hop-by-Hop Option header before sending the ICMPv6 message to the
   source.

3.1.  In-situ OAM in IPv6 Hop by Hop Extension Header

   This section defines in-situ OAM for IPv6 transport.  In-situ OAM
   data is transported as an IPv6 hop-by-hop extension header.

3.1.1.  In-situ OAM Hop by Hop Options

   Brief recap of the IPv6 hop-by-hop header as well as the options used
   for carrying in-situ OAM data:

           packet's Destination Address was a multicast address, send an
           ICMP Parameter Problem, Code 2, message to the packet's
           Source Address, pointing to the unrecognized Option Type.

      11 - discard the packet and, only if the packet's Destination

   In-situ OAM data records are inserted as options in an IPv6 hop-by-
   hop extension header:

   1.  Tracing Option: The in-situ OAM Tracing option defined in
       [I-D.brockners-inband-oam-data] is represented as a IPv6 option
       in hop by hop extension header by allocating following type:

       Option Type:  001xxxxxx 8-bit identifier of the type of option.
          xxxxxx=TBD_IANA_TRACE_OPTION_IPV6.

   2.  Proof of Transit Option: The in-situ OAM POT option defined in
       [I-D.brockners-inband-oam-data] is represented as a IPv6 option
       in hop by hop extension header by allocating following type:

       Option Type:  001xxxxxx 8-bit identifier of the type of option.
          xxxxxx=TBD_IANA_POT_OPTION_IPV6.

   3.  Edge to Edge Option: The in-situ OAM E2E option defined in
       [I-D.brockners-inband-oam-data] is represented as a IPv6 option
       in hop by hop extension header by allocating following type:

       Option Type:  000xxxxxx 8-bit identifier of the type of option.
          xxxxxx=TBD_IANA_E2E_OPTION_IPV6.

3.1.2.  Procedure at the Ingress Edge to Insert the In-situ OAM Header

   In an administrative domain where in-situ OAM is used, insertion of
   the in-situ OAM header is enabled at the required edge nodes (i.e. at
   the encapsulating/decapsulating nodes) by means of configuration.

   Such a configuration SHOULD allow selective enablement of in-situ OAM
   header insertion for a subset of traffic (e.g., one or several
   "pipes").

   Further the ingress edge node should be aware of maximum size of the
   header that can be inserted.  Details on how the maximum size/size of
   the in-situ OAM domain are retrieved are outside the scope of this
   document.

   Let n = max number of nodes updating in-situ OAM data;
   (calculated based on the packet size and the minimal MTU on all
   links within the OAM domain)

   Let k = number of node data records that can be allocated
   by this node.

   Let node_data_size = size of each node_data based on
   in-situ OAM type.

   if (packet matches traffic for which in-situ OAM is enabled) {
       Create in-situ OAM hbyh ext-header with k node data records
       preallocated.
       Increment payload length in IPv6 header:
                         with size of in-situ OAM hbyh ext-header
       Populate node data at:
          (size of in-situ OAM hbyh ext-header = 8) + k * node_data_size
       from the beginning of the header
       Set Elements-left to: k - 1

       Update "Next Header" field in main IPv6 header and
       set "Next Header" field of OAM hbyh extension header
       appropriately.
    }

3.1.3.  Procedure at Transit Nodes

   If a network node receives a packet with an in-situ OAM header and it
   is enabled to process in-situ OAM data it performs the following:

   k = number of node data that this node can allocate

   if (in-situ OAM ext hbyh ext-header is present) {
       if (Elements-left > 0)) {
         populate node data at :
            node_data_start[Elements-left]
         Elements-left = Elements-left - 1
       }
   }

3.1.4.  Procedure at the Egress Edge to Remove the In-situ OAM Header

   egress_edge = list of interfaces where in-situ OAM hbyh ext
                  header is to be stripped

   Before forwarding packet out of interfaces in egress_edge list:

   if (in-situ OAM hbyh ext-header is present) {
      remove the in-situ OAM hbyh ext-header,
      possibly store the record along with additional
      fields for analysis and export
      Decrement Payload Length in IPv6 header
      by size of in-situ OAM ext header

      Update "Next Header" field in main IPv6 header and
      set "Next Header" field of OAM hbyh extension header
      appropriately.
   }

4.  In-situ OAM Metadata Transport in IPv4

   Transport of in-situ OAM data in IPv4 will be detailed in a future
   version of this document.

5.  In-situ OAM Metadata Transport in VXLAN-GPE

   VXLAN-GPE [I-D.ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe] encapsulation is somewhat similar
   to IPv6 extension headers in that a series of headers can be
   contained in the header as a linked list.  The different in-situ OAM
   types are added as options within a new in-situ OAM protocol header
   in VXLAN GPE.  In an administrative domain where in-situ OAM is used,
   insertion of the in-situ OAM protocol header in VXLAN GPE is enabled
   at the VXLAN GPE tunnel endpoint which also serve as in-situ OAM
   encapsulating/decapsulating nodes by means of configuration.

   The VXLAN-GPE header and fields are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-nvo3-vxlan-gpe]. in-situ OAM specific fields and header are
   defined here:

   Type:  8-bit unsigned integer defining in-situ OAM header type

   in-situ OAM HDR len:  8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the in-situ
      OAM HDR in 8-octet units

   in-situ OAM options:  Variable-length field, of length such that the
      complete in-situ OAM header is an integer multiple of 8 octets
      long.  Contains one or more TLV-encoded options of the format:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- - - - - - - - -
   |  Option Type  |  Opt Data Len |  Option Data
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- - - - - - - - -

      Option Type          8-bit identifier of the type of option.

      Opt Data Len         8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the Option
                           Data field of this option, in octets.

      Option Data          Variable-length field.  Option-Type-specific
                           data.

   The in-situ OAM options defined in [I-D.brockners-inband-oam-data]
   are encoded with an option type allocated in the new in-situ OAM IANA
   registry - in-situ OAM_PROTOCOL_OPTION_REGISTRY_IANA_TBD.  In
   addition the following padding options are defined to be used when
   necessary to align subsequent options and to pad out the containing
   header to a multiple of 8 octets in length.

   Pad1 option  (alignment requirement: none)

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |       0       |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       NOTE: The format of the Pad1 option is a special case -- it does
             not have length and value fields.

       The Pad1 option is used to insert one octet of padding into the
       Options area of a header.  If more than one octet of padding is
       required, the PadN option, described next, should be used, rather
       than multiple Pad1 options.

   PadN option  (alignment requirement: none)

       |       1       |  Opt Data Len |  Option Data
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+- - - - - - - - -
       The PadN option is used to insert two or more octets of padding
       into the Options area of a header.  For N octets of padding, the
       Opt Data Len field contains the value N-2, and the Option Data
       consists of N-2 zero-valued octets.

6.  In-situ OAM Metadata Transport in NSH

   In Service Function Chaining (SFC) [RFC7665], the Network Service
   Header (NSH) [I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh] already includes path tracing
   capabilities [I-D.penno-sfc-trace], but currently does not offer a
   solution to securely prove that packets really traversed the service

   chain.  The "Proof of Transit" capabilities (see
   [I-D.brockners-inband-oam-requirements] and
   [I-D.brockners-proof-of-transit]) of in-situ OAM can be leveraged
   within NSH.  In an administrative domain where in-situ OAM is used,
   insertion of the in-situ OAM data into the NSH header is enabled at
   the required nodes (i.e. at the in-situ OAM encapsulating/
   decapsulating nodes) by means of configuration.

   Proof of transit in-situ OAM data is added as NSH Type 2 metadata:

   TLV Class:  Describes the scope of the "Type" field.  In some cases,
      the TLV Class will identify a specific vendor, in others, the TLV
      Class will identify specific standards body allocated types.  POT
      is currently defined using the Cisco (0x0009) TLV class.

   Type:  The specific type of information being carried, within the
      scope of a given TLV Class.  Value allocation is the
      responsibility of the TLV Class owner.  Currently a type value of
      0x94 is used for proof of transit

   Reserved bits:  Two reserved bit are present for future use.  The
      reserved bits MUST be set to 0x0.

   F: One bit.  Indicates which POT-profile is active. 0 means the even
      POT-profile is active, 1 means the odd POT-profile is active.

   Length:  Length of the variable metadata, in 4-octet words.  Here the
      length is 4.

   Random:  64-bit Per-packet Random number.

   Cumulative:  64-bit Cumulative that is updated by the Service
      Functions.

7.  In-situ OAM Metadata Transport in Segment Routing

7.1.  In-situ OAM in SR with IPv6 Transport

   Similar to NSH, a service chain or path defined using Segment Routing
   for IPv6 can be verified using the in-situ OAM "Proof of Transit"
   approach.  The Segment Routing Header (SRH) for IPv6 offers the
   ability to transport TLV structured data, similar to what NSH does
   (see [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header]).  In an domain where in-
   situ OAM is used, insertion of the in-situ OAM data is enabled at the
   required edge nodes (i.e. at the in-situ OAM encapsulating/
   decapsulating nodes) by means of configuration.

   A new "POT TLV" is defined for the SRH which is to carry proof of
   transit in situ OAM data.

   Type:  To be assigned by IANA.

   Length:  18.

   RESERVED:  8 bits.  SHOULD be unset on transmission and MUST be
      ignored on receipt.

   F: 1 bit.  Indicates which POT-profile is active. 0 means the even
      POT-profile is active, 1 means the odd POT-profile is active.

   Flags:  8 bits.  No flags are defined in this document.

   Random:  64-bit per-packet random number.

   Cumulative:  64-bit cumulative value that is updated at specific
      nodes that form the service path to be verified.
