   Abstract
   This Internet Draft describes the major carrier's service
   requirements for the automatic switched optical networks
   (ASON) from both an end-user's as well as an operator's
   perspectives. Its focus is on the description of the
   service building blocks and service-related control
   plane functional requirements. The management functions
   for the optical services and their underlying networks
   are beyond the scope of this document and will be addressed
   in a separate document.

1. Introduction


   Optical transport networks are evolving from the current TDM-based
   SONET/SDH optical networks as defined by ITU Rec. G.803 [ITU-G803] to
   the emerging WDM-based optical transport networks (OTN) as defined by
   the ITU Rec. G.872 in [ITU-G872]. Therefore in the near future,
   carrier optical transport networks will consist of a mixture of the
   SONET/SDH-based sub-networks and the WDM-based wavelength or fiber
   switched OTN sub-networks. The OTN networks can be either transparent
   or opaque depending upon if O-E-O functions are utilized within the
   sub-networks. Optical networking encompasses the functionalities for
   the establishment, transmission, multiplexing, switching of optical
   connections carrying a wide range of user signals of varying formats
   and bit rate.

   Some of the biggest challenges for the carriers are bandwidth

Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-02.txt    March, 2002


   management and fast service provisioning in such a multi-technology
   networking environment. The emerging and rapidly evolving automatic
   switched optical networks or ASON technology [ITU-G8080, ITU-G807] is
   aimed at providing optical networks with intelligent networking
   functions and capabilities in its control plane to enable rapid
   optical connection provisioning, dynamic rerouting as well as
   multiplexing and switching at different granularity level, including
   fiber, wavelength and TDM time slots. The ASON control plane should
   not only enable the new networking functions and capabilities for the
   emerging OTN networks, but significantly enhance the service
   provisioning capabilities for the existing SONET/SDH networks as
   well.

   The ultimate goals should be to allow the carriers to quickly and
   dynamically provision network resources and to enhance network
   survivability using ring and mesh-based protection and restoration
   techniques. The carriers see that this new networking platform will
   create tremendous business opportunities for the network operators
   and service providers to offer new services to the market, reduce
   their network Capital and Operational expenses (CAPEX and OPEX), and
   improve their network efficiency.

1.1. Justification

   The charter of the IPO WG calls for a document on "Carrier Optical
   Services Requirements" for IP/Optical networks. This document
   addresses that aspect of the IPO WG charter. Furthermore, this
   document was accepted as an IPO WG document by unanimous agreement at
   the IPO WG meeting held on March 19, 2001, in Minneapolis, MN, USA.
   It presents a carrier and end-user perspective on optical network
   services and requirements.


1.2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


1.3. Value Statement

   By deploying ASON technology, a carrier expects to achieve the
   following benefits from both technical and business perspectives:

   - Rapid Circuit Provisioning: ASON technology will enable the dynamic
   end-to-end provisioning of the optical connections across the optical
   network by using standard routing and signaling protocols.



Y. Xue et al                                                    [Page 4]





Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-02.txt    March, 2002


   - Enhanced Survivability: ASON technology will enable the network to
   dynamically reroute an optical connection in case of a failure using
   mesh-based network protection and restoration techniques, which
   greatly improves the cost-effectiveness compared to the current line
   and ring protection schemes in the SONET/SDH network.

   - Cost-Reduction: ASON networks will enable the carrier to better
   utilize the optical network , thus achieving significant unit cost
   reduction per Megabit due to the cost-effective nature of the optical
   transmission technology, simplified network architecture and reduced
   operation cost.

   - Service Flexibility: ASON technology will support provisioning of
   an assortment of existing and new services such as protocol and bit-
   rate independent transparent network services, and bandwidth-on-
   demand services.

   - Enhanced Interoperability: ASON technology will use a control plane
   utilizing industry and international standards architecture and
   protocols, which facilitate the interoperability of the optical
   network equipment from different vendors.


   In addition, the introduction of a standards-based control plane
   offers the following potential benefits:

   - Reactive traffic engineering at optical layer that allows network
   resources to be dynamically allocated to traffic flow.

   - Reduce the need for service providers to develop new operational
   support systems software for the network control and new service
   provisioning on the optical network, thus speeding up the deployment
   of the optical network technology and reducing the software
   development and maintenance cost.

   - Potential development of a unified control plane that can be used
   for different transport technologies including OTN, SONET/SDH, ATM
   and PDH.



1.4.  Scope of this document

   This document is intended to provide, from the carriers perspective,
   a service framework and some associated requirements in relation to
   the optical services to be offered in the next generation optical
   transport networking environment and their service control and
   management functions.  As such, this document concentrates on the

Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-02.txt    March, 2002


   requirements driving the work towards realization of the automatic
   switched optical networks.  This document is intended to be protocol-
   neutral, but the specific goals include providing the requirements to
   guide the control protocol development and enhancement within IETF in
   terms of reuse of IP-centric control protocols in the optical
   transport network.


   Every carrier's needs are different. The objective of this document
   is NOT to define some specific service models. Instead, some major
   service building blocks are identified that will enable the carriers
   to use them in order to create the best service platform most
   suitable to their business model. These building blocks include
   generic service types, service enabling control mechanisms and
   service control and management functions.

   The fundamental principles and basic set of requirements for the
   control plane of the automatic switched optical networks have been
   provided in a series of ITU Recommendations under the umbrella of the
   ITU ASTN/ASON architectural and functional requirements as listed
   below:

   Architecture:

   Switched Transport Network (ASTN)[ASTN]

   This document provides further detailed requirements based on this
   ASTN/ASON framework. In addition, even though we consider IP a major
   client to the optical network in this document, the same requirements
   and principles should be equally applicable to non-IP clients such as
   SONET/SDH, ATM, ITU G.709, etc.

3. General Requirements

   In this section, a number of generic requirements related to the
   service control and management functions are discussed.


3.1. Separation of Networking Functions

   It makes logical sense to segregate the networking functions within
   each layer network into three logical functional planes: control
   plane, data plane and management plane. They are responsible for
   providing network control functions, data transmission functions and
   network management functions respectively. The crux of the ASON
   network is the networking intelligence that contains automatic
   routing, signaling and discovery functions to automate the network
   control functions.

   Control Plane: includes the functions related to networking control
   capabilities such as routing, signaling, and policy control, as well
   as resource and service discovery. These functions are automated.




Y. Xue et al                                                    [Page 7]





Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-02.txt    March, 2002


   Data Plane (transport plane): includes the functions related to
   bearer channels and signal transmission.

   Management Plane: includes the functions related to the management
   functions of network element, networks and network resources and
   services. These functions are less automated as compared to control
   plane functions.

   Each plane consists of a set of interconnected functional or control
   entities, physical or logical, responsible for providing the
   networking or control functions defined for that network layer.

   The separation of the control plane from both the data and management
   plane is beneficial to the carriers in that it:

   - Allows equipment vendors to have a modular system design that will
   be more reliable and maintainable thus reducing the overall systems
   ownership and operation cost.

   - Allows carriers to have the flexibility to choose a third party
   vendor control plane software systems as its control plane solution
   for its switched optical network.


   - Allows carriers to deploy a unified control plane and
   OSS/management systems to manage and control different types of
   transport networks it owes.

   - Allows carriers to use a separate control network specially
   designed and engineered for the control plane communications.


   The separation of control, management and transport function is
   required and it shall accommodate both logical and physical level
   separation.

   Note that it is in contrast to the IP network where the control
   messages and user traffic are routed and switched based on the same
   network topology due to the associated in-band signaling nature of
   the IP network.


3.2. Separation of call and connection control

   To support many enhanced optical services, such as scheduled
   bandwidth on demand and bundled connections, a call model based on
   the separation of the call control and connection control is
   essential.



Y. Xue et al                                                    [Page 8]





Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-02.txt    March, 2002


   The call control is responsible for the end-to-end session
   negotiation, call admission control and call state maintenance while
   connection control is responsible for setting up the connections
   associated with a call across the network. A call can correspond to
   zero, one or more connections depending upon the number of
   connections needed to support the call.

   The existence of the connection depends upon the existence of its
   associated call session and connection can be deleted and re-
   established while still keeping the call session up.

   The call control shall be provided at an ingress port or gateway port
   to the network such as UNI and E-NNI.

   The control plane shall support the separation of the call control
   from the connection control.

   The control plane shall support call  admission control on call setup
   and connection admission control on connection setup.


3.3.  Network and Service Scalability

   Although some specific applications or networks may be on a small
   scale, the control plane protocol and functional capabilities shall
   support large-scale networks.

   In terms of the scale and complexity of the future optical network,
   the following assumption can be made when considering the scalability
   and performance that are required of the optical control and
   management functions.

   - There may be up to thousands of OXC nodes and the same or higher
   order of magnitude of OADMs per carrier network.

   - There may be up to thousands of terminating ports/wavelength per
   OXC node.

   - There may be up to hundreds of parallel fibers between a pair of
   OXC nodes.

   - There may be up to hundreds of wavelength channels transmitted on
   each fiber.

   In relation to the frequency and duration of the optical connections:

   - The expected end-to-end connection setup/teardown time should be in
   the order of seconds, preferably less.



Y. Xue et al                                                    [Page 9]





Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-02.txt    March, 2002


   - The expected connection holding times should be in the order of
   minutes or greater.

   - There may be up to millions of simultaneous optical connections
   switched across a single carrier network.

   Note that even though automated rapid optical connection provisioning
   is required, the carriers expect the majority of provisioned
   circuits, at least in short term, to have a long lifespan ranging
   from months to years.

   In terms of service provisioning, some carriers may choose to perform
   testing prior to turning over to the customer.


3.4. Transport Network Technology

   Optical services can be offered over different types of underlying
   optical transport technologies including both TDM-based SONET/SDH
   network and WDM-based OTN networks.

   For this document, standards-based transport technologies SONET/SDH
   as defined in the ITU Rec. G.803 and OTN implementation framing as
   defined in ITU Rec. G.709 shall be supported.

   Note that the service characteristics such as bandwidth granularity
   and signaling framing hierarchy to a large degree will be determined
   by the capabilities and constraints of the server layer network.


3.5.  Service Building Blocks

   The primary goal of this document is to identify a set of basic
   service building blocks the carriers can use to create the best
   suitable service models that serve their business needs.

   The service building blocks are comprised of a well-defined set of
   capabilities and a basic set of control and management functions.
   These capabilities and functions should support a basic set of
   services and enable a carrier to build enhanced services through
   extensions and customizations. Examples of the building blocks
   include the connection types, provisioning methods, control
   interfaces, policy control functions, and domain internetworking
   mechanisms, etc.

4.  Service Model and Applications

   A carrier's optical network supports multiple types of service
   models. Each service model may have its own service operations,
   target markets, and service management requirements.


4.1.  Service and Connection Types

   The optical network is primarily offering high bandwidth connectivity
   in the form of connections, where a connection is defined to be a
   fixed bandwidth connection between two client network elements, such
   as IP routers or ATM switches, established across the optical
   network. A connection is also defined by its demarcation from ingress
   access point, across the optical network, to egress access point of
   the optical network.

   The following connection capability topologies must be supported:

   - Bi-directional point-to-point connection

   - Uni-directional point-to-point connection

   - Uni-directional point-to-multipoint connection

   For point-to-point connection, the following three types of network
   connections based on different connection set-up control methods
   shall be supported:

   - Permanent connection (PC): Established hop-by-hop directly on each
   ONE along a specified path without relying on the network routing and
   signaling capability. The connection has two fixed end-points and
   fixed cross-connect configuration along the path and will stays
   permanently until it is deleted. This is similar to the concept of
   PVC in ATM.

   - Switched connection (SC): Established through UNI signaling
   interface and the connection is dynamically established by network
   using the network routing and signaling functions. This is similar to
   the concept of SVC in ATM.

   - Soft permanent connection (SPC): Established by specifying two PC
   at end-points and let the network dynamically establishes a SC
   connection in between. This is similar to the SPVC concept in ATM.


   The PC and SPC connections should be provisioned via management plane
   to control interface and the SC connection should be provisioned via

Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-02.txt    March, 2002


   signaled UNI interface.


4.2.  Examples of Common Service Models

   Each carrier may define its own service model based on it business
   strategy and environment. The following are three example service
   models that carriers may use.


4.2.1.  Provisioned Bandwidth Service (PBS)

   The PBS model provides enhanced leased/private line services
   provisioned via service management interface (MI)  using either PC or
   SPC type of connection. The provisioning can be real-time or near
   real-time. It has the following characteristics:

   - Connection request goes through a well-defined management interface

   - Client/Server relationship between clients and optical network.

   - Clients have no optical network visibility and depend on network
   intelligence or operator for optical connection setup.


4.2.2.  Bandwidth on Demand Service (BDS)

   The BDS model provides bandwidth-on-demand dynamic connection
   services via signaled user-network interface (UNI). The provisioning
   is real-time and is using SC type of optical connection. It has the
   following characteristics:

   - Signaled connection request via UNI directly from the user or its
   proxy.

   - Customer has no or limited network visibility depending upon the
   control interconnection model used and network administrative policy.

   - Relies on network or client intelligence for connection set-up
   depending upon the control plane interconnection model used.


4.2.3.  Optical Virtual Private Network (OVPN)

   The OVPN model provides virtual private network at the optical layer
   between a specified set of user sites.  It has the following
   characteristics:




Y. Xue et al                                                   [Page 12]





Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-02.txt    March, 2002


   - Customers contract for specific set of network resources such as
   optical connection ports, wavelengths, etc.

   - Closed User Group (CUG) concept is supported as in normal VPN.

   - Optical connection can be of PC, SPC or SC type depending upon the
   provisioning method used.

   - An OVPN site can request dynamic reconfiguration of the connections
   between sites within the same CUG.

   - A customer may have visibility and control of network resources up
   to the extent allowed by the customer service contract.

   At a minimum, the PBS, BDS and OVPN service models described above
   shall be supported by the control functions.


5.  Network Reference Model

   This section discusses major architectural and functional components
   of a generic carrier optical network, which will provide a reference
   model for describing the requirements for the control and management
   of carrier optical services.


5.1.  Optical Networks and Subnetworks

   As mentioned before, there are two main types of optical networks
   that are currently under consideration: SDH/SONET network as defined
   in ITU Rec. G.803, and OTN as defined in ITU Rec. G.872.

   We assume an OTN is composed of a set of optical cross-connects (OXC)
   and optical add-drop multiplexer (OADM) which are interconnected in a
   general mesh topology using DWDM optical line systems (OLS).

   It is often convenient for easy discussion and description to treat
   an optical network as an subnetwork cloud, in which the details of
   the network become less important, instead focus is on the function
   and the interfaces the optical network provides. In general, a
   subnetwork can be defined as a set of access points on the network
   boundary and a set of point-to-point optical connections between
   those access points.

5.2.  Network Interfaces

   A generic carrier network reference model describes a multi-carrier
   network environment. Each individual carrier network can be further
   partitioned into domains or sub-networks based on administrative,
   technological or architectural reasons.  The demarcation between
   (sub)networks can be either logical or physical and  consists of a
   set of reference points identifiable in the optical network. From the
   control plane perspective, these reference points define a set of
   control interfaces in terms of optical control and management
   functionality. The following figure 5.1 is an illustrative diagram
   for this.

                         Figure 5.1 Generic Carrier Network Reference 
Model


   The network interfaces encompass two aspects of the networking
   functions: user data plane interface and control plane interface. The
   former concerns about user data transmission across the physical
   network interface and the latter concerns about the control message
   exchange across the network interface such as signaling, routing,
   etc. We call the former physical interface (PI) and the latter
   control plane interface. Unless otherwise stated, the control
   interface is assumed in the remaining of this document.


5.2.1.  Control Plane Interfaces

   Control interface defines a relationship between two connected
   network entities on both side of the interface. For each control
   interface, we need to define an architectural function each side
   plays and a controlled set of information that can be exchanged



Y. Xue et al                                                   [Page 15]





Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-02.txt    March, 2002


   across the interface. The information flowing over this logical
   interface may include, but not limited to:

   - Endpoint name and address

   - Reachability/summarized network address information

   - Topology/routing information

   - Authentication and connection admission control information

   - Connection management signaling messages

   - Network resource control information

   Different types of the interfaces can be defined for the network
   control and architectural purposes and can be used as the network
   reference points in the control plane. In this document, the
   following set of interfaces are defined as shown in Figure 5.1. The
   User-Network Interface (UNI) is a bi-directional signaling interface
   between service requester and service provider control entities. The
   service request control entity resides outside the carrier network
   control domain.


   The Network-Network Interface  (NNI) is a bi-directional signaling
   interface between two optical network elements or sub-networks.

   We differentiate between interior (I-NNI) and exterior (E-NNI) NNI as
   follows:

   - E-NNI: A NNI interface between two control plane entities belonging
   to different control domains.

   - I-NNI: A NNI interface between two control plane entities within
   the same control domain in the carrier network.

   It should be noted that it is quite common to use E-NNI between two
   sub-networks within the same carrier network if they belong to
   different control domains. Different types of interface, interior vs.
   exterior, have different implied trust relationship for security and
   access control purposes. Trust relationship is not binary, instead a
   policy-based control mechanism need to be in place to restrict the
   type and amount of information that can flow cross each type of
   interfaces depending the carrier's service and business requirements.
   Generally, two networks have a trust relationship if they belong to
   the same administrative domain.




Y. Xue et al                                                   [Page 16]





Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-02.txt    March, 2002


   An example of an interior interface is an I-NNI between two optical
   network elements in a single control domain. Exterior interface
   examples include an E-NNI between two different carriers or a UNI
   interface between a carrier optical network and its customers.

   The control plane shall support the UNI and NNI interface described
   above and the interfaces shall be configurable in terms of the type
   and amount of control information exchange and their behavior shall
   be consistent with the configuration (i.e., exterior versus interior
   interfaces).



5.3. Intra-Carrier Network Model

   Intra-carrier network model concerns the network service control and
   management issues within networks owned by a single carrier.


5.3.1. Multiple Sub-networks

   Without loss of generality, the optical network owned by a carrier
   service operator can be depicted as consisting of one or more optical
   sub-networks interconnected by direct optical links. There may be
   many different reasons for more than one optical sub-networks It may
   be the result of using hierarchical layering, different technologies
   across access, metro and long haul (as discussed below), or a result
   of business mergers and acquisitions or incremental optical network
   technology deployment by the carrier using different vendors or
   technologies.

   A sub-network may be a single vendor and single technology network.
   But in general, the carrier's optical network is heterogeneous in
   terms of equipment vendor and the technology utilized in each sub-
   network.


5.3.2.  Access, Metro and Long-haul networks

   Few carriers have end-to-end ownership of the optical networks. Even
   if they do, access, metro and long-haul networks often belong to
   different administrative divisions as separate optical sub-networks.
   Therefore Inter-(sub)-networks interconnection is essential in terms
   of supporting the end-to-end optical service provisioning and
   management. The access, metro and long-haul networks may use
   different technologies and architectures, and as such may have
   different network properties.




Y. Xue et al                                                   [Page 17]





Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-02.txt    March, 2002


   In general, end-to-end optical connectivity may easily cross multiple
   sub-networks with the following possible scenarios:
   Access -- Metro -- Access
   Access - Metro -- Long Haul -- Metro - Access


5.4.  Inter-Carrier Network Model

   The inter-carrier model focuses on the service and control aspects
   between different carrier networks and describes the internetworking
   relationship between them.


5.4.1.  Carrier Network Interconnection

   Inter-carrier interconnection provides for connectivity between
   optical network operators. To provide the global reach end-to-end
   optical services, optical service control and management between
   different carrier networks becomes essential. It is possible to
   support distributed peering within the IP client layer network where
   the connectivity between two distant IP routers can be achieved via
   an optical transport network.


5.4.2. Implied Control Constraints

   In the inter-carrier network model, each carrier's optical network is
   a separate administrative domain. Both the UNI interface between the
   user and the carrier network and the NNI interface between two
   carrier's networks are crossing the carrier's administrative boundary
   and therefore are by definition exterior interfaces.

   In terms of control information exchange, the topology information
   shall not be allowed to cross both E-NNI and UNI interfaces.

6.  Optical Service User Requirements

   This section describes the user requirements for optical services,
   which in turn impose the requirements on service control and
   management for the network operators. The user requirements reflect
   the perception of the optical service from a user's point of view.


6.1.  Common Optical Services

   The basic unit of an optical transport service is fixed-bandwidth
   optical connectivity between parties. However different services are
   created based on its supported signal characteristics (format, bit
   rate, etc), the service invocation methods and possibly the
   associated Service Level Agreement (SLA) provided by the service
   provider.

   At present, the following are the major optical services provided in
   the industry:


   - SONET/SDH, with different degrees of transparency

   - Optical wavelength services

   - Ethernet at 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps

   - Storage Area Networks (SANs) based on FICON, ESCON and Fiber
   Channel



   Optical Wavelength Service refers to transport services where signal
   framing is negotiated between the client and the network operator
   (framing and bit-rate dependent), and only the payload is carried
   transparently. SONET/SDH transport is most widely used for network-
   wide transport. Different levels of transparency can be achieved in
   the SONET/SDH transmission.


   Ethernet Services, specifically 1Gb/s and 10Gbs Ethernet services,
   are gaining more popularity due to the lower costs of the customers'
   premises equipment and its simplified management requirements
   (compared to SONET or SDH).

   Ethernet services may be carried over either SONET/SDH (GFP mapping)
   or WDM networks. The Ethernet service requests will require some
   service specific parameters: priority class, VLAN Id/Tag, traffic



Y. Xue et al                                                   [Page 19]





Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-02.txt    March, 2002


   aggregation parameters.

   Storage Area Network (SAN) Services. ESCON and FICON are proprietary
   versions of the service, while Fiber Channel is the standard
   alternative. As is the case with Ethernet services, SAN services may
   be carried over either SONET/SDH (using GFP mapping) or WDM networks.

   The control plane shall provide the carrier with the capability
   functionality to provision, control and manage all the services
   listed above.


6.2.  Bearer Interface Types

   All the bearer interfaces implemented in the ONE shall be supported
   by the control plane and associated signaling protocols.

   The following interface types shall be supported by the signaling
   protocol:
   - SDH/SONET
   - 1 Gb Ethernet, 10 Gb Ethernet (WAN mode)
   - 10 Gb Ethernet (LAN mode)
   - FC-N (N= 12, 50, 100, or 200) for Fiber Channel services
   - OTN (G.709)
   - PDH



6.3.  Optical Service Invocation

   As mentioned earlier, the methods of service invocation play an
   important role in defining different services.


6.3.1. Provider-Controlled Service Provisioning

   In this scenario, users forward their service request to the provider
   via a well-defined service management interface. All connection
   management operations, including set-up, release, query, or
   modification shall be invoked from the management plane.


6.3.2. User-Control Service Provisioning

   In this scenario, users forward their service request to the provider
   via a well-defined UNI interface in the control plane (including
   proxy signaling). All connection management operation requests,
   including set-up, release, query, or modification shall be invoked



Y. Xue et al                                                   [Page 20]





Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-02.txt    March, 2002


   from directly connected user devices, or its signaling representative
   (such as a signaling proxy).


6.3.3. Call set-up requirements

   In summary the following requirements for the control plane have been
   identified:


   - The control plane shall support action result codes as responses to
   any requests over the control interfaces.

   - The control plane shall support requests for call set-up, subject
   to policies in effect between the user and the network.

   - The control plane shall support the destination client device's
   decision to accept or reject call set-up requests from the source
   client's device.

   - The control plane shall support requests for call set-up and
   deletion across multiple (sub)networks.

   - NNI signaling shall support requests for call set-up, subject to
   policies in effect between the (sub)networks.

   - Call set-up shall be supported for both uni-directional and bi-
   directional connections.

   - Upon call request initiation, the control plane shall generate a
   network unique Call-ID associated with the connection, to be used for
   information retrieval or other activities related to that connection.

   - CAC shall be provided as part of the call control functionality. It
   is the role of the CAC function to determine if the call can be
   allowed to proceed based on resource availability and authentication.

   - Negotiation for call set-up for multiple service level options
   shall be supported.

   - The policy management system must determine what kind of calls can
   be set up.

   - The control plane elements need the ability to rate limit (or pace)
   call setup attempts into the network.

   - The control plane shall report to the management plane, the
   Success/Failures of a call request.



Y. Xue et al                                                   [Page 21]





Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-02.txt    March, 2002


   - Upon a connection request failure, the control plane shall report
   to the management plane a cause code identifying the reason for the
   failure and all allocated resources shall be released. A negative
   acknowledgment shall be returned to the source.

   - Upon a connection request success a positive acknowledgment shall
   be returned to the source when a connection has been successfully
   established, the control plane shall be notified.


   - The control plane shall support requests for call release by Call-
   ID.

   - The control plane shall allow any end point or any intermediate
   node to initiate call release procedures.

   - Upon call release completion all resources associated with the call
   shall become available for access for new requests.

   - The management plane shall be able to release calls or connections
   established by the control plane both gracefully and forcibly on
   demand.

   - Partially deleted calls or connections shall not remain within the
   network.

   - End-to-end acknowledgments shall be used for connection deletion
   requests.

   - Connection deletion shall not result in either restoration or
   protection being initiated.

   - The control plane shall support management plane and neighboring
   device requests for status query.

   - The UNI shall support initial registration and updates of the UNI-C
   with the network via the control plane.



6.4.  Optical Connection granularity

   The service granularity is determined by the specific technology,
   framing and bit rate of the physical interface between the ONE and
   the client at the edge and by the capabilities of the ONE. The
   control plane needs to support signaling and routing for all the
   services supported by the ONE. In general, there should not be a one-
   to-one correspondence imposed between the granularity of the service



Y. Xue et al                                                   [Page 22]





Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-02.txt    March, 2002


   provided and the maximum capacity of the interface to the user.

   The control plane shall support the ITU Rec. G.709 connection
   granularity for the OTN network.

   The control plane shall support the SDH/SONET connection granularity.

   Sub-rate interfaces shall be supported by the optical control plane
   such as VT /TU granularity (as low as 1.5 Mb/s).

   In addition, 1 Gb and 10 Gb granularity shall be supported for 1 Gb/s
   and 10 Gb/s (WAN mode) Ethernet framing types, if implemented in the
   hardware.

   The following fiber channel interfaces shall be supported by the
   control plane if the given interfaces are available on the equipment:

   - FC-12
   - FC-50
   - FC-100
   - FC-200

   Encoding of service types in the protocols used shall be such that
   new service types can be added by adding new code point values or
   objects.



6.5.  Other Service Parameters and Requirements


6.5.1.  Classes of Service

   We use "service level" to describe priority related characteristics
   of connections, such as holding priority, set-up priority, or
   restoration priority. The intent currently is to allow each carrier
   to define the actual service level in terms of priority, protection,
   and restoration options. Therefore, individual carriers will
   determine mapping of individual service levels to a specific set of
   quality features.

   The control plane shall be capable of mapping individual service
   classes into specific protection and / or restoration options.








Y. Xue et al                                                   [Page 23]





Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-02.txt    March, 2002


6.5.2.  Diverse Routing Attributes

   The ability to route service paths diversely is a highly desirable
   feature. Diverse routing is one of the connection parameters and is
   specified at the time of the connection creation. The following
   provides a basic set of requirements for the diverse routing support.

   The control plane routing algorithms shall be able to route a single
   demand diversely from N previously routed demands in terms of link
   disjoint path, node disjoint path and SRLG disjoint path.


7.  Optical Service Provider Requirements

   This section discusses specific service control and management
   requirements from the service provider's point of view.


7.1.  Access Methods to Optical Networks

   Multiple access methods shall be supported:

   - Cross-office access (User NE co-located with ONE)

   - Direct remote access (Dedicated links to the user)

   - Remote access via access sub-network (via a
   multiplexing/distribution sub-network)


   All of the above access methods must be supported.


7.2.  Dual Homing and Network Interconnections

   Dual homing is a special case of the access network. Client devices
   can be dual homed to the same or different hub, the same or different
   access network, the same or different core networks, the same or
   different carriers.  The different levels of dual homing connectivity
   result in many different combinations of configurations. The main
   objective for dual homing is for enhanced survivability.

   Dual homing must be supported. Dual homing shall not require the use
   of multiple addresses for the same client device.

7.3.  Inter-domain connectivity

   A domain is a portion of a network, or an entire network that is
   controlled by a single control plane entity.  This section discusses
   the various requirements for connecting domains.


7.3.1.  Multi-Level Hierarchy

   Traditionally current transport networks are divided into core inter-
   city long haul networks, regional intra-city metro networks and
   access networks. Due to the differences in transmission technologies,
   service, and multiplexing needs, the three types of networks are
   served by different types of network elements and often have
   different capabilities. The diagram below shows an example three-
   level hierarchical network.

                          +--------------+
                          |  Core Long   |
               +----------+   Haul       +---------+
               |          | Subnetwork   |         |
               |          +--------------+         |
       +-------+------+                    +-------+------+
       |              |                    |              |
       |  Regional    |                    |  Regional    |
       |  Subnetwork  |                    |  Subnetwork  |
       +-------+------+                    +-------+------+
               |                                   |
       +-------+------+                    +-------+------+
       |              |                    |              |
       | Metro/Access |                    | Metro/Access |
       |  Subnetwork  |                    |  Subnetwork  |
       +--------------+                    +--------------+

                    Figure 2 Multi-level hierarchy example


   Routing and signaling for multi-level hierarchies shall be supported
   to allow carriers to configure their networks as needed.


7.3.2.  Network Interconnections

   Subnetworks may have multiple points of inter-connections. All
   relevant NNI functions, such as routing, reachability information
   exchanges, and inter-connection topology discovery must recognize and
   support multiple points of inter-connections between subnetworks.
   Dual inter-connection is often used as a survivable architecture.



Y. Xue et al                                                   [Page 25]





Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-02.txt    March, 2002


   The control plane shall provide support for routing and signaling for
   subnetworks having multiple points of interconnection.



7.4.  Names and Address Management


7.4.1.  Address Space Separation

   To ensure the scalability of and smooth migration toward to the
   optical switched network, the separation of three address spaces are
   required:

   - Internal transport network addresses: This is used for routing
   control plane messages within the transport network.

   - Transport Network Assigned (TNA) address: This is a routable
   address in the optical transport network.

   - Client addresses: This address has significance in the clientlayer.




7.4.2.  Directory Services

   Directory Services shall support address resolution and translation
   between various user edge device names and corresponding optical
   network addresses.  UNI shall use the user naming schemes for
   connection request.


7.4.3.  Network element Identification

   Each control domain and each network element within it shall be
   uniquely identifiable.



7.5.  Policy-Based Service Management Framework

   The IPO service must be supported by a robust policy-based management
   system to be able to make important decisions.

   Examples of policy decisions include:

   - What types of connections can be set up for a given UNI?



Y. Xue et al                                                   [Page 26]





Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-02.txt    March, 2002


   - What information can be shared and what information must be
   restricted in automatic discovery functions?

   - What are the security policies over signaling interfaces?

   - What border nodes should be used when routing depend on factors
   including, but not limited to source and destination address, border
   nodes loading, time of connection request.

   Requirements:

   - Service and network policies related to configuration and
   provisioning, admission control, and support of Service Level
   Agreements (SLAs) must be flexible, and at the same time simple and
   scalable.

   - The policy-based management framework must be based on standards-
   based policy systems (e.g., IETF COPS).

   - In addition, the IPO service management system must support and be
   backwards compatible with legacy service management systems.



8.  Control Plane Functional Requirements for Optical Services

   This section addresses the requirements for the optical control plane
   in support of service provisioning.

   The scope of the control plane include the control of the interfaces
   and network resources within an optical network and the interfaces
   between the optical network and its client networks. In other words,
   it should include both NNI and UNI aspects.


8.1.  Control Plane Capabilities and Functions

   The control capabilities are supported by the underlying control
   functions and protocols built in the control plane.


8.1.1.  Network Control Capabilities


   The following capabilities are required in the network control plane
   to successfully deliver automated provisioning for optical services:
   - Network resource discovery




Y. Xue et al                                                   [Page 27]





Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-02.txt    March, 2002


   - Address assignment and resolution

   - Routing information propagation and dissemination

   - Path calculation and selection

   - Connection management

   These capabilities may be supported by a combination of functions
   across the control and the management planes.


8.1.2.  Control Plane Functions for network control

   The following are essential functions needed to support network
   control capabilities:

   - Signaling
   - Routing
   - Automatic resource, service and neighbor discovery

   Specific requirements for signaling, routing and discovery are
   addressed in Section 9.


   The general requirements for the control plane functions to support
   optical networking and service functions include:

   - The control plane must have the capability to establish, teardown
   and maintain the end-to-end connection, and the hop-by-hop connection
   segments between any two end-points.

   - The control plane must have the capability to support traffic-
   engineering requirements including resource discovery and
   dissemination, constraint-based routing and path computation.

   - The control plane shall support network status or action result
   code responses to any requests over the control interfaces.

   - The control plane shall support call admission control on UNI and
   connection-admission control on NNI.

   - The control plane shall support graceful release of network
   resources associated with the connection after aUpon successful
   connection teardown or failed connections.

   - The control plane shall support management plane request for
   connection attributes/status query.



Y. Xue et al                                                   [Page 28]





Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-02.txt    March, 2002


   - The control plane must have the capability to support various
   protection and restoration schemes.

   - Control plane failures shall not affect active connections and
   shall not adversely impact the transport and data planes.

   - The control plane should allow separation of major control function
   entities including routing, signaling and discovery and should allow
   different control distribution of those functionalities, including
   centralized, distributed or hybrid.

   - The control plane should allow physical separation of the control
   plane from the transport plane to support either tightly coupled or
   loosely coupled control plane solutions.

   - The control plane should support the routing and signaling proxy to
   participate in the normal routing and signaling message exchange and
   processing.

   - Security and resilience are crucial issues for the control plane
   and will be addressed in Section 10 and 11 of this document.




8.2.  Control Message Transport Network

   The control message transport network is a transport network for
   control plane messages and it consists of a set of control channels
   that interconnect the nodes within the control plane. Therefore, the
   control message transport network must be accessible by each of the
   communicating nodes (e.g., OXCs). If an out-of-band IP-based control
   message transport network is an overlay network built on top of the 
   IP data network using some tunneling technologies, these tunnels must
   be standards-based such as IPSec, GRE, etc.

   - The control message transport network must terminate at each of the
   nodes in the transport plane.

   - The control message transport network shall not be assumed to have
   the same topology as the data plane, nor shall the data plane and
   control plane traffic be assumed to be congruently routed.

   A control channel is the communication path for transporting control
   messages between network nodes, and over the UNI (i.e., between the
   UNI entity on the user side (UNI-C) and the UNI entity on the network
   side (UNI-N)). The control messages include signaling messages,



Y. Xue et al                                                   [Page 29]





Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-02.txt    March, 2002


   routing information messages, and other control maintenance protocol
   messages such as neighbor and service discovery.

   The following three types of signaling in the control channel shall
   be supported:

   - In-band signaling: The signaling messages are carried over a
   logical communication channel embedded in the data-carrying optical
   link or channel. For example, using the overhead bytes in SONET data
   framing as a logical communication channel falls into the in-band
   signaling methods.

   - In fiber, Out-of-band signaling: The signaling messages are carried
   over a dedicated communication channel separate from the optical
   data-bearing channels, but within the same fiber. For example, a
   dedicated wavelength or TDM channel may be used within the same fiber
   as the data channels.

   - Out-of-fiber signaling: The signaling messages are carried over a
   dedicated communication channel or path within different fibers to
   those used by the optical data-bearing channels. For example,
   dedicated optical fiber links or communication path via separate and
   independent IP-based network infrastructure are both classified as
   out-of-fiber signaling.

   The UNI control channel and proxy signaling defined in the OIF UNI
   1.0 [OIFUNI] shall be supported.

   The control message transport network provides communication
   mechanisms between entities in the control plane.

   - The control message transport network shall support reliable
   message transfer.

   - The control message transport network shall have its own OAM
   mechanisms.

   - The control message transport network shall use protocols that
   support congestion control mechanisms.

   In addition, the control message transport network should support
   message priorities. Message prioritization allows time critical
   messages, such as those used for restoration, to have priority over
   other messages, such as other connection signaling messages and
   topology and resource discovery messages.

   The control message transport network shall be highly reliable and
   implement failure recovery.

Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-02.txt    March, 2002


8.3.  Control Plane Interface to Data Plane

   In the situation where the control plane and data plane are provided
   by different suppliers, this interface needs to be standardized.
   Requirements for a standard control-data plane interface are under
   study. The specification of a control plane interface to the data
   plane is outside the scope of this document.

   Control plane should support a standards based interface to configure
   and switching fabrics and port functions.

   Data plane shall monitor and detect the failure (LOL, LOS, etc.) and
   quality degradation (high BER, etc.) of the signals and be able to
   provide signal-failure and signal-degrade alarms to the control plane
   accordingly to trigger proper mitigation actions in the control
   plane.



8.4.  Management Plane Interface to Data Plane

   The management plane shall be responsible for the network resource
   management in the data plane. It should able to partition the network
   resources and control the allocation and the deallocation of the
   resource for the use by the control plane.

   Data plane shall monitor and detect the failure and quality
   degradation of the signals and be able to provide signal-failure and
   signal-degrade alarms plus associated detailed fault information to
   the management plane to trigger and enable the management for fault
   location and repair.

   Management plane failures shall not affect the normal operation of a
   configured and operational control plane or data plane.



8.5.  Control Plane Interface to Management Plane

   The control plane is considered a managed entity within a network.
   Therefore, it is subject to management requirements just as other
   managed entities in the network are subject to such requirements.

   Control plane should be able to service the requests from the
   management plane for end-to-end connection provisioning (e.g. SPC
   connection) and control plane database information query (e.g.
   topology database)




Y. Xue et al                                                   [Page 31]





Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-02.txt    March, 2002


   Control plane shall report all the control plane faults to the
   management plane with detailed fault information

   In general, the management plane shall have authority over the
   control plane. Management plane should be able to configure the
   routing, signaling and discovery control parameters such as hold-down
   timers, hello-interval, etc. to effect the behavior of the control
   plane. In the case of network failure, both the management plane and
   the control plane need fault information at the same priority. The
   control plane shall be responsible for providing necessary statistic
   data such as call counts, traffic counts to the management plane.
   They should be available upon the query from the management plane.
   The management plane shall be able to tear down connections
   established by the control plane both gracefully and forcibly on
   demand.


8.6.  Control Plane Interconnection

   When two (sub)networks are interconnected on transport plane level,
   so should be two corresponding control network at the control plane.
   The control plane interconnection model defines the way how two
   control networks can be interconnected in terms of controlling
   relationship and control information flow allowed between them.


8.6.1.  Interconnection Models

   There are three basic types of control plane network interconnection
   models: overlay, peer and hybrid, which are defined by the IETF IPO
   WG document [IPO_frame], as discussed in the Appendix.


   Choosing the level of coupling depends upon a number of different
   factors, some of which are:

   - Variety of clients using the optical network

   - Relationship between the client and optical network

   - Operating model of the carrier


   Overlay model (UNI like model) shall be supported for client to
   optical control plane interconnection.

   Other models are optional for client to optical control plane
   interconnection.



Y. Xue et al                                                   [Page 32]





Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-02.txt    March, 2002


   For optical to optical control plane interconnection all three models
   shall be supported. In general, the priority for support of
   interconnection models should be overlay, hybrid and peer, in
   decreasing order.


9.  Requirements for Signaling, Routing and Discovery


9.1.  Requirements for information sharing over UNI, I-NNI and E-NNI

   Different types of interfaces shall impose different requirements and
   functionality due to their different trust relationships.
   Specifically:

   -  Topology information shall not be exchanged across E-NNI and UNI.

   -  The control plane shall allow the carrier to configure the type
   and extent of control information exchange across various interfaces.

   -  Address resolution exchange over UNI is needed if an addressing
      directory service is not available.


9.2.  Signaling Functions

   Call and connection control and management signaling messages are
   used for the establishment, modification, status query and release of
   an end-to-end optical connection.  Unless otherwise specified, the
   word "signaling" refers to both inter-domain and intra-domain
   signaling.

   - The inter-domain signaling protocol shall be agnostic to the intra-
   domain signaling protocol for all the domains within the network.

   - Signaling shall support both strict and loose routing.

   - Signaling shall support individual as well as groups of connection
   requests.

   - Signaling shall support fault notifications.

   - Inter-domain signaling shall support per connection, globally
   unique identifiers for all connection management primitives based on
   a well-defined naming scheme.

   - Inter-domain signaling shall support crank-back and rerouting.




Y. Xue et al                                                   [Page 33]





Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-02.txt    March, 2002


9.3.  Routing Functions

   Routing includes reachability information propagation, network
   topology/resource information dissemination and path computation.
   Network topology/resource information dissemination is to provide
   each node in the network with information about the carrier network
   such that a single node is able to support constraint-based path
   selection.  A mixture of hop-by-hop routing, explicit/source routing
   and hierarchical routing will likely be used within future transport
   networks.

   All three mechanisms (Hop-by-hop routing, explicit / source-based
   routing and hierarchical routing) must be supported.  Messages
   crossing untrusted boundaries must not contain information regarding
   the details of an internal network topology.

   Requirements for routing information dissemination:

   - The inter-domain routing protocol shall be agnostic to the intra-
   domain routing protocol within any of the domains within the network.

   - The exchange of the following types of information shall be
   supported by inter-domain routing protocols:

      - Inter-domain topology
      - Per-domain topology abstraction
      - Per domain reachability information

   - Metrics for routing decisions supporting load sharing, a range of
   service granularity and service types, restoration capabilities,
   diversity, and policy.

   Major concerns for routing protocol performance are scalability and
   stability, which impose the following requirement on the routing
   protocols:

   - The routing protocol shall scale with the size of the network

   The routing protocols shall support following requirements:

   1. Routing protocol shall support hierarchical routing information
   dissemination, including topology information aggregation and
   summarization.

   2. The routing protocol(s) shall minimize global information and keep
      information locally significant as much as possible.
      Over external interfaces only reachability information, next
   



Y. Xue et al                                                   [Page 34]





Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-02.txt    March, 2002


   routing hop and service capability information should be exchanged. 
Any
   other network related information shall not leak out to other 
networks.

   3. The routing protocol shall be able to minimize global information
   and keep information locally significant as much as possible (e.g.,
   information local to a node, a sub-network, a domain, etc). For
   example, a single optical node may have thousands of ports. The ports
   with common characteristics need not to be advertised individually.

   4.  The routing protocol shall distinguish static routing information
   and dynamic routing information. The routing protocol operation shall
   update dynamic and static routing information differently. Only 
dynamic
   routing information shall be updated in real time.

   5. Routing protocol shall be able to control the dynamic information
   updating frequency through different types of thresholds. Two types
   of thresholds could be defined: absolute threshold and relative
   threshold.

   6. The routing protocol shall support trigger-based and timeout-based
   information update.

   7. Inter-domain routing protocol shall support policy-based routing
   information exchange.

   8. The routing protocol shall be able to support different levels of
   protection/restoration and other resiliency requirements. These are 
   discussed in Section 10.


   All the scalability techniques will impact the network resource
   representation accuracy. The tradeoff between accuracy of the routing
   information and the routing protocol scalability is an important
   consideration to be made by network operators.



9.4.  Requirements for path selection

    The following are functional requirements for path selection:

   - Path selection shall support shortest path routing.

   - Path selection shall also support constraint-based routing.  At
   least the following constraints shall be supported:



Y. Xue et al                                                   [Page 35]





Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-02.txt    March, 2002


        - Cost
        - Link utilization
        - Diversity
        - Service Class

   - Path selection shall be able to include/exclude some specific
   network resources, based on policy.

   - Path selection shall be able to support different levels of
   diversity, including node, link, SRLG and SRG.

   - Path selection algorithms shall provide carriers the ability to
   support a wide range of services and multiple levels of service
   classes. Parameters such as service type, transparency, bandwidth,
   latency, bit error rate, etc. may be relevant.


9.5.  Automatic Discovery Functions

   Automatic discovery functions include neighbor, resource and service
   discovery.


9.5.1.  Neighbor discovery

   Neighbor Discovery can be described as an instance of auto-discovery
   that is used for associating two network entities within a layer
   network based on a specified adjacency relation.

   The control plane shall support the following neighbor discovery
   capability as described in [ITU-g7714]:

   - Physical media adjacency that detects and verifies the physical
   layer network connectivity between two connected network element
   ports.

   - Logical network adjacency that detects and verify the logical
   network layer connection above the physical layer between network
   layer specific ports.

   - Control adjacency that detect and verify the logical neighboring
   relation between two control entities associated with data plane
   network elements that form either physical or logical adjacency.

    The control plane shall support manual neighbor adjacency
   configuration to either overwrite or supplement the automatic
   neighbor discovery function.




Y. Xue et al                                                   [Page 36]





Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-02.txt    March, 2002


9.5.2. Resource Discovery

   Resource discovery is concerned with the ability to verify physical
   connectivity between two ports on adjacent network elements, improve
   inventory management of network resources, detect configuration
   mismatches between adjacent ports, associating port characteristics
   of adjacent network elements, etc. Resource discovery shall be
   supported.

   Resource discovery can be achieved through either manual provisioning
   or automated procedures. The procedures are generic while the
   specific mechanisms and control information can be technology
   dependent.

   After neighbor discovery resource verification and monitoring must be
   performed periodically to verify physical attributes to ensure
   compatibility.


9.5.3. Service Discovery

   Service Discovery can be described as an instance of auto-discovery
   that is used for verifying and exchanging service capabilities of a
   network. Service discovery can only happen after neighbor discovery.
   Since service capabilities of a network can dynamically change,
   service discovery may need to be repeated.

   Service discovery is required for all the optical services supported.


10.  Requirements for service and control plane resiliency

   Resiliency is a network capability to continue its operations under
   the condition of failures within the network.  The automatic switched
   optical network assumes the separation of control plane and data
   plane. Therefore the failures in the network can be divided into
   those affecting the data plane and those affecting the control plane.
   To provide enhanced optical services, resiliency measures in both
   data plane and control plane should be implemented. The following
   failure handling principles shall be supported.

   The control plane shall provide optical service failure detection and
   recovery functions such that the failures in the data plane within
   the control plane coverage can be quickly mitigated.

   The failure of control plane shall not in any way adversely affect
   the normal functioning of existing optical connections in the data
   plane.



Y. Xue et al                                                   [Page 37]





Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-02.txt    March, 2002


   In general, there shall be no single point of failure for all major
   control plane functions, including signaling, routing etc. The
   control plane shall provide reliable transfer of signaling messages
   and flow control mechanisms for easing any congestion within the
   control plane.


10.1.  Service resiliency

   In circuit-switched transport networks, the quality and reliability
   of the established optical connections in the transport plane can be
   enhanced by the protection and restoration mechanisms provided by the
   control plane functions.  Rapid recovery is required by transport
   network providers to protect service and also to support stringent
   Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that dictate high reliability and
   availability for customer connectivity.

   Protection and restoration are closely related techniques for
   repairing network node and link failures. Protection is a collection
   of failure recovery techniques meant to rehabilitate failed
   connections by pre-provisioning dedicated protection network
   connections and switching to the protection circuit once the failure
   is detected.  Restoration is a collection of reactive techniques used
   to rehabilitate failed connections by dynamic rerouting the failed
   connection around the network failures using the shared network
   resources.

   The protection switching is characterized by shorter recovery time at
   the cost of the dedicated network resources while dynamic restoration
   is characterized by longer recover time with efficient resource
   sharing.  Furthermore, the protection and restoration can be
   performed either on a per link/span basis or on an end-to-end
   connection path basis. The formal is called local repair initiated a
   node closest to the failure and the latter is called global repair
   initiated from the ingress node.

   The protection and restoration actions are usually in reaction to the
   failure in the networks. However, during the network maintenance
   affecting the protected connections, a network operator need to
   proactively force the traffic on the protected connections to switch
   to its protection connection.

   The failure and signal degradation in the transport plane is usually
   technology specific and therefore shall be monitored and detected by
   the transport plane.

   The transport plane shall report both physical level failure and
   signal degradation to the control plane in the form of the signal

   failure alarm and signal degrade alarm.

   The control plane shall support both alarm-triggered and hold-down
   timers based protection switching and dynamic restoration for failure
   recovery.

   Clients will have different requirements for connection availability.
   These requirements can be expressed in terms of the "service level",
   which can be mapped to different restoration and protection options
   and priority related connection characteristics, such as holding
   priority(e.g. pre-emptable or not), set-up priority, or restoration
   priority. However, how the mapping of individual service levels to a
   specific set of protection/restoration options and connection
   priorities will be determined by individual carriers.

   In order for the network to support multiple grades of service, the
   control plane must support differing protection and restoration
   options on a per connection basis.

   In order for the network to support multiple grades of service, the
   control plane must support setup priority, restoration priority and
   holding priority on a per connection basis.

   In general, the following protection schemes shall be considered for
   all protection cases within the network:
   - Dedicated protection: 1+1 and 1:1
   - Shared protection: 1:N and M:N.
   - Unprotected

   The control plane shall support "extra-traffic" capability, which
   allows unprotected traffic to be transmitted on the protection
   circuit.

   The control plane shall support both trunk-side and drop-side
   protection switching.

   The following restoration schemes should be supported:
   - Restorable
   - Un-restorable

   Protection and restoration can be done on an end-to-end basis per
   connection. It can also be done on a per span or link basis between
   two adjacent network nodes. These schemes should be supported.

   The protection and restoration actions are usually triggered by the
   failure in the networks. However, during the network maintenance
   affecting the protected connections, a network operator need to
   proactively force the traffic on the protected connections to switch

   to its protection connection. Therefore in order to support easy
   network maintenance, it is required that management initiated
   protection and restoration be supported.

   Protection and restoration configuration should be based on software
   only.

   The control plane shall allow the modification of protection and
   restoration attributes on a per-connection basis.

   The control plane shall support mechanisms for reserving bandwidth
   resources for restoration.

   The control plane shall support mechanisms for normalizing connection
   routing (reversion) after failure repair.

   Normal connection management operations (e.g., connection deletion)
   shall not result in protection/restoration being initiated.


10.2.  Control plane resiliency

   The control plane may be affected by failures in signaling network
   connectivity and by software failures (e.g., signaling, topology and
   resource discovery modules).

   The signaling control plane should implement signaling message
   priorities to ensure that restoration messages receive preferential
   treatment, resulting in faster restoration.

   The optical control plane signal network shall support protection and
   restoration options to enable it to self-healing in case of failures
   within the control plane.

   Control network failure detection mechanisms shall distinguish
   between control channel and software process failures.

   The control plane failure shall only impact the capability to
   provision new services.

   Fault localization techniques for the isolation of failed control
   resources shall be supported.

   Recovery from control plane failures shall result in complete
   recovery and re-synchronization of the network.

11.  Security Considerations

   In this section, security considerations and requirements for optical
   services and associated control plane requirements are described.


11.1.  Optical Network Security Concerns

   Since optical service is directly related to the physical network
   which is fundamental to a telecommunications infrastructure,
   stringent security assurance mechanism should be implemented in
   optical networks.

   In terms of security, an optical connection consists of two aspects.
   One is security of the data plane where an optical connection itself
   belongs, and the other is security of the control plane.


11.1.1.  Data Plane Security

   - Misconnection shall be avoided in order to keep the user's data
   confidential.  For enhancing integrity and confidentiality of data,
   it may be helpful to support scrambling of data at layer 2 or
   encryption of data at a higher layer.


11.1.2.  Control Plane Security

   It is desirable to decouple the control plane from the data plane
   physically.

   Restoration shall not result in miss-connections (connections
   established to a destination other than that intended), even for
   short periods of time (e.g., during contention resolution). For
   example, signaling messages, used to restore connectivity after
   failure, should not be forwarded by a node before contention has been
   resolved.

   Additional security mechanisms should be provided to guard against
   intrusions on the signaling network. Some of these may be done with
   the help of the management plane.


   - Network information shall not be advertised across exterior
   interfaces (UNI or E-NNI). The advertisement of network information
   across the E-NNI shall be controlled and limited in a configurable
   policy based fashion. The advertisement of network information shall
   be isolated and managed separately by each administration.



Y. Xue et al                                                   [Page 41]





Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-02.txt    March, 2002


   - The signaling network itself shall be secure, blocking all
   unauthorized access.  The signaling network topology and addresses
   shall not be advertised outside a carrier's domain of trust.

   - Identification, authentication and access control shall be
   rigorously used by network operators for providing access to the
   control plane.

   - Discovery information, including neighbor discovery, service
   discovery, resource discovery and reachability information should be
   exchanged in a secure way.

   - Information on security-relevant events occurring in the control
   plane or security-relevant operations performed or attempted in the
   control plane shall be logged in the management plane.

   - The management plane shall be able to analyze and exploit logged
   data in order to check if they violate or threat security of the
   control plane.

   - The control plane shall be able to generate alarm notifications
   about security related events to the management plane in an
   adjustable and selectable fashion.

   - The control plane shall support recovery from successful and
   attempted intrusion attacks.


11.2.  Service Access Control

   From a security perspective, network resources should be protected
   from unauthorized accesses and should not be used by unauthorized
   entities. Service access control is the mechanism that limits and
   controls entities trying to access network resources. Especially on
   the UNI and E-NNI, Connection Admission Control (CAC) functions
   should also support the following security features:

   - CAC should be applied to any entity that tries to access network
   resources through the UNI (or E-NNI). CAC should include an
   authentication function of an entity in order to prevent masquerade
   (spoofing). Masquerade is fraudulent use of network resources by
   pretending to be a different entity. An authenticated entity should
   be given a service access level in a configurable policy basis.

   - The UNI and NNI should provide optional mechanisms to ensure origin
   authentication and message integrity for connection management
   requests such as set-up, tear-down and modify and connection
   signaling messages. This is important in order to prevent Denial of



Y. Xue et al                                                   [Page 42]





Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-02.txt    March, 2002


   Service attacks. The UNI and E-NNI should also include mechanisms,
   such as usage-based billing based on CAC, to ensure non-repudiation
   of connection management messages.


   - Each entity should be authorized to use network resources according
   to the service level given.

   Appendix: Interconnection of Control Planes

   The interconnection of the IP router (client) and optical control
   planes can be realized in a number of ways depending on the required
   level of coupling.  The control planes can be loosely or tightly
   coupled.  Loose coupling is generally referred to as the overlay
   model and tight coupling is referred to as the peer model.
   Additionally there is the augmented model that is somewhat in between
   the other two models but more akin to the peer model.  The model
   selected determines the following:

   - The details of the topology, resource and reachability information
   advertised between the client and optical networks

   - The level of control IP routers can exercise in selecting paths
   across the optical network

   The next three sections discuss these models in more details and the
   last section describes the coupling requirements from a carrier's
   perspective.


 Peer Model (I-NNI like model)

   Under the peer model, the IP router clients act as peers of the
   optical transport network, such that single routing protocol instance
   runs over both the IP and optical domains.  In this regard the
   optical network elements are treated just like any other router as
   far as the control plane is concerned. The peer model, although not
   strictly an internal NNI, behaves like an I-NNI in the sense that
   there is sharing of resource and topology information.

   Presumably a common IGP such as OSPF or IS-IS, with appropriate
   extensions, will be used to distribute topology information.  One
   tacit assumption here is that a common addressing scheme will also be
   used for the optical and IP networks.  A common address space can be
   trivially realized by using IP addresses in both IP and optical
   domains.  Thus, the optical networks elements become IP addressable
   entities.

   The obvious advantage of the peer model is the seamless
   interconnection between the client and optical transport networks.
   The tradeoff is that the tight integration and the optical specific
   routing information that must be known to the IP clients.

   The discussion above has focused on the client to optical control
   plane inter-connection.  The discussion applies equally well to



Y. Xue et al                                                   [Page 47]

   inter-connecting two optical control planes.


Overlay (UNI-like model)

   Under the overlay model, the IP client routing, topology
   distribution, and signaling protocols are independent of the routing,
   topology distribution, and signaling protocols at the optical layer.
   This model is conceptually similar to the classical IP over ATM
   model, but applied to an optical sub-network directly.

   Though the overlay model dictates that the client and optical network
   are independent this still allows the optical network to re-use IP
   layer protocols to perform the routing and signaling functions.

   In addition to the protocols being independent the addressing scheme
   used between the client and optical network must be independent in
   the overlay model.  That is, the use of IP layer addressing in the
   clients must not place any specific requirement upon the addressing
   used within the optical control plane.

   The overlay model would provide a UNI to the client networks through
   which the clients could request to add, delete or modify optical
   connections.  The optical network would additionally provide
   reachability information to the clients but no topology information
   would be provided across the UNI.


Augmented model (E-NNI like model)

   Under the augmented model, there are actually separate routing
   instances in the IP and optical domains, but information from one
   routing instance is passed through the other routing instance.  For
   example, external IP addresses could be carried within the optical
   routing protocols to allow reachability information to be passed to
   IP clients.  A typical implementation would use BGP between the IP
   client and optical network.

   The augmented model, although not strictly an external NNI, behaves
   like an E-NNI in that there is limited sharing of information.

   Generally in a carrier environment there will be more than just IP
   routers connected to the optical network.  Some other examples of
   clients could be ATM switches or SONET ADM equipment.  This may drive
   the decision towards loose coupling to prevent undue burdens upon
   non-IP router clients.  Also, loose coupling would ensure that future
   clients are not hampered by legacy technologies.




Y. Xue et al                                                   [Page 48]





Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipo-carrier-requirements-02.txt    March, 2002


   Additionally, a carrier may for business reasons want a separation
   between the client and optical networks.  For example, the ISP
   business unit may not want to be tightly coupled with the optical
   network business unit.  Another reason for separation might be just
   pure politics that play out in a large carrier.  That is, it would
   seem unlikely to force the optical transport network to run that same
   set of protocols as the IP router networks.  Also, by forcing the
   same set of protocols in both networks the evolution of the networks
   is directly tied together.  That is, it would seem you could not
   upgrade the optical transport network protocols without taking into
   consideration the impact on the IP router network (and vice versa).

   Operating models also play a role in deciding the level of coupling.
   [Freeland] gives four main operating models envisioned for an optical
   transport network: - ISP owning all of its own infrastructure (i.e.,
   including fiber and duct to the customer premises)

   - ISP leasing some or all of its capacity from a third party

   - Carriers carrier providing layer 1 services

   - Service provider offering multiple layer 1, 2, and 3 services over
   a common infrastructure



   Although relatively few, if any, ISPs fall into category 1 it would
   seem the mostly likely of the four to use the peer model.  The other
   operating models would lend themselves more likely to choose an
   overlay model.  Most carriers would fall into category 4 and thus
   would most likely choose an overlay model architecture.
