Internet-Draft             Deprecation of RH0                   May 2007


Abstract

   The functionality provided by IPv6's Type 0 Routing Header can be
   exploited in order to perform remote network discovery, to bypass
   firewalls and to achieve packet amplification for the purposes of
   generating denial-of-service traffic.  This document updates the IPv6
   specification to deprecate the use of IPv6 Type 0 Routing Headers, in
   the light of these security concerns.

Internet-Draft             Deprecation of RH0                   May 2007


1.  Introduction

   [RFC2460] defines an IPv6 extension header called "Routing Header",
   identified by a Next Header value of 43 in the immediately preceding
   header.  A particular Routing Header subtype denoted as "Type 0" is
   also defined.  Type 0 Routing Headers are referred to as "RH0" in
   this document.

   Use of RH0 has been shown to have unpleasant security implications.
   This document deprecates the use of RH0.

2.  Definitions

   RH0 in this document denotes the IPv6 Extension Header type 43
   ("Routing Header") variant 0 ("Type 0 Routing Header"), as defined in
   [RFC2460].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Implementation

   Compliant IPv6 hosts and routers MUST NOT transmit IPv6 datagrams
   containing RH0.

4.  Operations

   Compliant IPv6 hosts and routers which receive IPv6 datagrams
   containing RH0 MUST silently discard those datagrams without further
   processing.

5.  Security Considerations

   The purpose of this document is to deprecate a feature of IPv6 which
   has been shown to have serious security implications.

   Specific examples of vulnerabilities which are facilitated by the
   availability of RH0 can be found in [BiondiEbalard].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests that IANA update the description of variant 0
   of IPv6 header-type 43 ("Routing Header") to indicate that the use of
   RH0 is deprecated.

7.  Acknowlegements

   An eloquent and useful description of the operational security
   implications of RH0 was presented by Philippe Biondi and Arnaud
   Ebalard at the CanSecWest conference in Vancouver, 2007
   [BiondiEbalard].  This presentation resulted in widespread publicity
   for the risks associated with RH0, and that in turn led to much
   discussion in the IETF.
