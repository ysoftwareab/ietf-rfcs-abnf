  Collaborative Intelligent Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning over a
                                Network

Abstract

   This document describes agent reinforcement learning (RL) in a
   distributed environment to transfer or share information for
   autonomous shortest path-planning over a communication network.  The
   centralized node, which is the main node to manage agent workflow in
   hybrid peer-to-peer environment, provides a cumulative reward for
   each action that a given agent takes with respect to an optimal path
   based on a to-be-learned policy over the learning process.  A reward
   from the centralized node is reflected when an agent explores to
   reach its destination for autonomous shortest path-planning in
   distributed nodes.

1.  Introduction

   In large surveilling applications, information of Critical Key
   Infrastructures and Resources (CKIR) to protect and share is
   necessary in larger ground, maritime and airborne areas, where there
   is a special need for collaborative intelligent distributed systems
   with intelligent learning schemes.  These applications also need the

   development of computational multi-agents learning systems in large
   distributed networking nodes, where the agents have limited,
   incomplete knowledge, and only access to local information in
   distributed computing nodes over a communication network.

   Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one effective technique to transfer
   and share information among agents for autonomous shortest agent path
   planning, as it does not require a-priori-knowledge of the agent's
   behavior or environment to accomplish its tasks [Megherbi].  Such a
   knowledge is usually acquired/learned automatically and autonomously
   by trial and error.

   Reinforcement Learning (RL) actions involve interacting with a given
   environment, so the environment provides an agent learning process
   with the elements as followings:

   o  Starting agent state, one or more obstacles, and agent
      destinations

   o  Initially, agent explores randomly in a given node

   o  Agents' actions to avoid an obstacle and move to one or more
      available positions to reach its goal(s)

   o  After an agent reaches its goal, it can use the information
      collected in initial random path-planning work to improve its
      learning speed

   o  Optimal ways in the following phase and exploratory learning
      trials

   Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of the Machine Learning techniques
   that will be adapted to the various networking environments for
   automatic networks [I-D.jiang-nmlrg-network-machine-learning].  Thus,
   this document provides motivation, learning technique, and use case
   for network machine learning.

3.1.  General Motivation for Reinforcement Learning (RL)

   Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a system capable of autonomous
   acquirement and incorporation of knowledge.  It can continuously
   self-improve learning speed with experience and attempts to maximize
   cumulative reward for a faster optimal path used in used in multi-
   agents-based monitoring systems [Teiralbar].

3.2.  Reinforcement Learning (RL) in networks

   In large surveilling applications, it is necessary to protect and
   share information in many Infrastructure and Resource area.  In
   wireless networking layers, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an
   emerging technology to monitor dynamics of the network to achieve
   fair resource allocation for nodes within the wireless mesh setting.
   Monitoring parameters of the network and adjusts based on the network
   dynamics can demonstrate to improve fairness in wireless environment
   Infrastructures and Resources [Nasim].

3.3.  Motivation in our work

   There are many different networking issues such as latency, traffic,
   management and etc.  Reinforcement learning [RL] is one of the
   Machine Learning mechanisms that will be applied with multiple cases
   to solve diverse networking problems against human operating
   capacities.  It can be a challenge-able due to a multitude of reasons
   such as large state space search, complexity in giving reward,
   difficulty in agent action selection, and difficulty in sharing/
   merging learned information among the agents in a distributed memory
   nodes to be transferred over a communication network [Minsuk].

4.1.  Autonomous Driving System

   Autonomous vehicle is capable of self-automotive driving without
   human supervision depending on optimized trust region policy by
   reinforcement learning (RL) that enables learning of more complex and
   special Neural Network.  Such a vehicle provides a comfortable user
   experience safely and reliably on interactive communication network
   [April][Markus].

4.2.  Game Theory

   The adaptive multi-agent system, which is combined with complexities
   from interacting game player, has developed in a field of
   reinforcement learning (RL).  In the early game theory, the
   interdisciplinary work was only focused on competitive games, but

   Reinforcement Learning (RL) has developed into a general framework
   for analyzing strategic interaction and has been attracted field as
   diverse as psychology, economics and biology [Ann].

4.3.  Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)

   Wireless sensor network (WSN) consists of a large number of sensors
   and sink nodes for monitoring systems with event parameters such as
   temperature, humidity, air conditioning, etc.  Reinforcement learning
   (RL) in WSNs has been applied in a wide range of schemes such as
   cooperative communication, routing and rate control.  The sensors and
   sink nodes are able to observe and carry out optimal actions on their
   respective operating environment for network and application
   performance enhancements [Kok-Lim].

4.4.  Routing Enhancement

   Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used to enhance multicast routing
   protocol in wireless ad hoc networks, where each node has different
   capability.  Routers in the multicast routing protocol are determined
   to discover optimal route with a predicted reward, and then the
   routers create the optimal path with multicast transmissions to
   reduce the overhead in Reinforcement Learning (RL) [Kok-Lim].

5.  Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (RL) Technologies

5.1.  Reinforcement Learning (RL)

   Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of the machine learning algorithms
   based on an agent learning process.  Reinforcement Learning (RL) is
   normally used with a reward from the centralized node, and capable of
   autonomous acquirement and incorporation of knowledge.  It is
   continuously self-improving and becoming more efficient as the
   learning process from an agent's experience to increase an agent
   learning speed for autonomous shortest path-planning
   [Sutton][Madera].

5.2.  Reward of Distance and Frequency

   In general, an agent takes the return values of its current state and
   next available state to decide and move an action, but the learning
   process in Reinforcement Learning (RL) involves lots of limitations
   since it provides the agents with only a single level of exploratory
   learning process.  The limitation is generated to reduce agent
   learning speed in an optimal path, so that the Distance-and-Frequency
   technique based on the Euclidean distance in Reinforcement Learning
   (RL) was derived to enhance agent's optimal learning speed.
   Distance-and-Frequency is based on more levels of agent visibility to

Internet-Draft    Reinforcement Learning over a Network       March 2017


   enhance learning algorithm by an additional way that uses the state
   occurrence frequency [Al-Dayaa].

5.3.  Distributed Computing Node

   Autonomous path-planning for multi-agent environment is related to
   agent transfer of path information, as the agents require information
   to achieve efficient path-planning on a given local node or
   distributed memory nodes over a communication network.

5.4.  Agent Sharing Information

   The quality of agent decision making often depends on the willingness
   of agents to share a given learning information with other agents for
   optimal path-planning.  Sharing Information means that an agent would
   share and communicate the knowledge learned and acquired with / to
   other agents using Message Passing Interface (MPI).  In sharing
   information, each agent has an attempt of exploring its environment,
   where all agents explore to reach their destinations via a
   distributed reinforcement reward-based learning method on the
   existing local distributed memory nodes.  The agents can be running
   on the same or different nodes over a communication network (via
   sharing information).  The agents have limited resources and
   incomplete knowledge of their environments.  Even if the agents do
   not share the capabilities and resources to monitor an entire given
   large terrain, they are able to share the needed information for
   collaborative path-planning in distributed networking nodes
   [Chowdappa][Minsuk].

5.5.  Sub-goal Selection

   A new technical method for agent sub-goal selection in distributed
   nodes is introduced to reduce the agent initial random exploration
   with a given selected sub-goal.

   [TBD]

5.6.  Cluttered-index-based scheme

   We propose a learning algorithm to optimize agent sub-goal selection.
   It is a proposed clutter-index-based technique for a new
   reinforcement learning scheme with a reward and an improved method to
   optimize multi-agent learning speed over a communication network.

6.  Proposed Architecture for Reinforcement Learning (RL)

   The architecture using Reinforcement Learning (RL) describes a
   collaborative multi-agent-based system in distributed environments as
   shown in figure 1, where the architecture is combined with a hybrid
   architecture making use of both a master / slave architecture and a
   peer-to-peer.  The centralized node, assigns each slave computing
   node a portion of the distributed terrain and an initial number of
   agents.  The network communication handles all communication among
   components and agents in the distributed networking environment.  The
   components are deployed on different nodes.  The communication
   handler alternatively sends one message from the outgoing queue and
   distributes one message in the incoming queue to the destination
   agent or component, and runs in a separate thread on each node with
   two message queues that consists of the incoming queue and the
   outgoing queue.

      Information

   In this section, we deal with case of a collaborative distributed
   multi-agent, where each agent has same or different individual
   destination in a distributed environment.  Since sharing information
   scheme among the agents is problematic one, we need to expand on the
   work described by solving the challenging cases.

   Basically, the main proposed algorithm is presented by distributed

   improve the overall system performance to transfer or share
   information from one node to another node in following cases;
