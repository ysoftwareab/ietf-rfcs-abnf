2.   Introduction 
 
   The authors of the CAPWAP Tunneling Protocol(CTP) [2] believe that 
   CTP provides a robust solution in the form of a protocol that 
   addresses the issues raised in the CAPWAP Problem Statement draft 
   [3].  CTP can be run over an L2 or an L3 network and it is extensible 
   to support WTPs which terminate other radio technologies than IEEE 
   802.11. 
    
   Given below is a brief analysis of the protocol with respect to the 
   objectives draft [4] that has been presented and discussed in the WG. 
 
3.   Objectives Responses 
3.1    Mandatory and Accepted Objectives   
    
3.1.1      Logical Groups 
   The ability to control and manage physical WTPs in terms of logical 
   groups. 
    
3.1.1.1        Protocol Evaluation 
   CTP natively recognizes WTP devices as logical groups. The protocol 
   provides capabilities discovery mechanisms (CTP_CAP_REQ/RESP) to 
   allow a device to enumerate physical and logical associations. These 
   associations are then carried forth into the protocol exchange and 
   state machines to decouple the logical operations such as Virtual 
   Radios from physical resources. 
    
3.1.1.2        Compliance 
   CTP is compliant with this objective. 
    
3.1.2      Support for Traffic Separation 
   This objective pertains to the need to maintain separation of control 
   and data traffic in the operation of the protocol. 
    
3.1.2.1        Protocol Evaluation 
   CTP provides specific message types providing for support of easy 
   separation of control and data paths. The CTP payload is explicitly 
   enumerated with it∆s own type (CTP Draft Section 5.3.1, CTP_DATA). In 
   addition the CTP implementation, by terminating the 802.1d conversion 
   at the WTP, provides a configurable option per logical WTP device to

 Internet-Draft             CTP Evaluation                   June 2005 
 
 
   indicate whether data traffic should be returned to the controller, 
   via tunneling, or natively be handled by the WTP by bridging locally 
   onto the wired network.  This only applies to data packets, whereas 
   the control channel within CTP is completely separate and terminates 
   at the controller always. 
    
3.1.2.2        Compliance 
   CTP is compliant with this objective. 
    
3.1.3      Wireless Terminal Transparency 
   This objective specifies the need for the protocol to be client 
   agnostic.  That is, the wireless terminals need not be aware of the 
   existence of the CAPWAP protocol running underneath. 
    
3.1.3.1        Protocol Evaluation 
   CTP provides mainly a set of provisioning methods for the WTPs 
   operations and data tunneling, but it∆s operation is transparent to 
   the connecting client. The connecting client simply interacts with 
   the WTP∆s wireless MAC implementation and it∆s traffic is bridge to 
   the network point of presence which may selectively be the controller 
   or the local wired infrastructure. In Controller mode the traffic is 
   encapsulated for transport but the client remains un-aware that 
   additional transport is taking place.  Shipping products with CTP 
   implementations have shown that this protocol does not have any 
   adverse effects, interoperability or otherwise, on the wireless 
   terminals. 
    
3.1.3.2        Compliance 
   CTP is compliant with this objective. 
    
3.1.4      Configuration Consistency 
   This objectives pertains to the protocol∆s ability to provide 
   consistent state information of the WTPs at the AC.   
    
3.1.4.1        Protocol Evaluation 
   CTP makes provisions for the periodic retrieval of WTP information 
   (CTP_Stats_REQ/RESP, CTP_STATS_Notify) such as RF statistics and Load 
   factors as per standard MIB specifications.  
    
3.1.4.2        Compliance 
   CTP is compliant with this objective. 
 
3.1.5       Firmware Trigger 
   This objective states that the protocol must have the ability to 
   trigger WTP firmware updates.  It does not necessarily state the need 
   for the protocol to integrate a software update mechanism within the 
   protocol itself.

 Internet-Draft             CTP Evaluation                   June 2005 
 
 
3.1.5.1        Protocol Evaluation 
   After the device capability exchange phase (CTP-CAP_REQ/RESP) which 
   allows for the identification of the type of WTP connecting, CTP 
   protocol specifies a phase of firmware image validation (CTP-
   Software-upgrade-req/resp, section 5.1.5) by which the WTP indicates 
   to the Controller what version of image it is currently running and 
   the response validates and requests an update if necessary. 
   Conversely, the Controller may explicitly request (Under 
   administrator∆s control) the firmware upgrade for a specified WTP.  
   CTP does not specify the actual method for firmware upgrade, but 
   rather assumes the application of standardized binary transport 
   protocols (FTP/TFTP).  
    
3.1.5.2        Compliance 
   CTP is compliant with this objective. 
    
3.1.6       Monitoring and Exchange of System-wide Resource State 
   This objective states that the protocol must incorporate the ability 
   for the WTP to send statistics, congestion indications and other 
   pertinent wireless state information to the AC. 
    
3.1.6.1         Protocol Evaluation 
   CTP protocol provides for the periodic exchange of a WTP∆s 
   operational statistics (CTP-Stats-req/resp, CTP-Stats-Notify, Section 
   5.2.7-9). The statistics characteristics may be enhanced to convey 
   necessary information set. 
    
3.1.6.2         Compliance 
   CTP is compliant with this objective. 
 
3.1.7       Resource Control Objective 
   This objective pertains to the ability of the protocol to provide a 
   mapping mechanism of the IEEE 802.11e QOS priorities across the 
   wireless and wired infrastructure. 
    
3.1.7.1         Protocol Evaluation 
   CTP, by virtue of being an IP based transport protocol, provides 
   several mechanisms to ensure the preservation of QoS markers within 
   the original data packet. The protocol header (CTP Section 4.1) 
   natively defines an 8-bit field for relaying of QoS policy related 
   information in a transport independent manner. This allows the WTP 
   and Controller to classify and guarantee the preservation of any 
   802.11e identifiers between the two entities. In addition, CTP 
   implementation must copy the TOS fields of the original data packet 
   onto the tunnel header.  The corresponding QoS markers are also 
   mapped to the layer 2 if 802.1q implemented in the interconnecting 
   network.

3.1.7.2         Compliance 
   CTP is compliant with this objective. 
    
3.1.8       CAPWAP Protocol Security 
   This objective concerns the security of the CAPWAP protocol.  The 
   protocol must support mutual authentication of the WTP and the AC and 
   the communication channel between the two entities must be secured.  
   In addition, however, the protocol must not preclude the possibility 
   of supporting asymmetric authentication mechanisms. 
    
3.1.8.1         Protocol Evaluation 
   First of all, as currently defined, CTP does not support a pre-shared 
   key mechanism for mutual authentication.  It assumes the existence of 
   digital certificates on the WTP and AC.  The mutual authentication 
   mechanism between WTP and AC using digital certificates as described 
   in the CTP draft is very similar to the method employed in the LWAPP 
   draft [5].  As such, some of the recent comments on the WG email list 
   regarding the security of LWAPP∆s mutual authentication also applies 
   to CTP.  Specifically in the area of the generation of the encryption 
   key.  Currently CTP specifies that the encryption key is generated by 
   the AC and is securely transported to the WTP.  An obvious 
   improvement would be for the WTP and the AC to mutually contribute to 
   the generation of the encryption key by providing independently 
   generated random material for the session keys. 
    
   Also, based on discussion on the WG list it is not clear whether the 
   use of pre-shared key for mutual authentication is required or simply 
   that the authentication must be mutual.  Nevertheless, we believe 
   that adding another method of mutual authentication, ie. with using 
   pre-shared keys, will enhance the flexibility of the CTP protocol, 
   but at the cost of increased protocol complexity. 
    
3.1.8.2         Compliance 
   CTP is partially compliant with this objective. 
    
3.1.9       System-wide Security 
   The protocol must not adversely affect the security of the wireless 
   and wired networks on which it runs. 
    
3.1.9.1         Protocol Evaluation 
   CTP defines that any exchanges of control based material such as PMK 
   is natively encrypted. All Control messages are mutually encrypted 
   between the WTP and controller. In lieu of a thorough security and 
   cryptographic analysis of the protocol by peers, the authors believe 
   that the encryption/keying mechanism currently provides adequate 
   protection against un-authorized compromise of the transported 
   information which, in turn, would not adversely affect the security 
   of the wireless or wired network.

3.1.9.2         Compliance 
   The protocol is partially compliant with this objective pending a 
   thorough security and cryptographic review. 
    
3.1.10        IEEE 802.11i Considerations 
   The CAPWAP protocol must determine the exact structure of the 
   centralized WLAN architecture in which authentication needs to be 
   supported, i.e. the location of major authentication components. 
    
   This may be achieved during WTP initialization where major 
   capabilities are distinguished. 
    
   The protocol must allow for the exchange of key information when 
   authenticator and encryption roles are located in distinct entities. 
    
3.1.10.1          Protocol Evaluation 
   During the capabilities exchange phase of the CTP protocol it is 
   determined whether the WTP implementation is a split-MAC or a local-
   MAC implementation.  This would in turn lead the AC to engage the 
   appropriate authentication modules of 802.11i.  The CTP protocol 
   defines that all control exchanges between WTP and Controller are 
   encrypted with own key pairs.  Therefore , the keying information 
   that is required is appropriately transported between WTP and AC in a 
   secure fashion.  For local-MAC implementation any frames relating to 
   authentication are relayed as control messages (CTP-Auth-Req/resp). 
   For split-MAC, the transport of this sensitive information may also 
   be carried as payload for the same message and therefore provide 
   encryption for transport. 
    
3.1.10.2          Compliance 
   CTP is compliant with this objective. 
    
3.1.11        Interoperability Objective 
   The objective specifies that the protocol must include a capabilities 
   exchange mechanism so that different types of WTPs can be managed by 
   ACs.  That is, local-MAC and split-MAC WTPs may be recognized by the 
   AC through protocol exchange and appropriate handling within the 
   protocol would ensue as a result of this capability exchange.   
    
3.1.11.1          Protocol Evaluation 
   The CTP protocol as specified, provides a mechanism for capabilities 
   exchange (CTP-caps-req/resp) that could be leveraged to allow the WTP 
   and the Controller to negotiate the operational mode as to whether 
   split-MAC or Local-MAC is implemented in the WTP.  In its current 
   form the draft does not specify the differences in the transport and 
   configuration that would occur if the WTP supports split-MAC.  The

 Internet-Draft             CTP Evaluation                   June 2005 
 
 
   authors are aware of this limitation in the draft and are working on 
   the same. 
    
3.1.11.2          Compliance 
   In its current form CTP is partially compliant with this objective. 
 
3.1.11.3         Protocol Specifications  
   This objective states that any vendor of a WTP or AC or any person 
   may implement the CAPWAP protocol and that all such implementations 
   should interoperate. 
    
3.1.11.4          Protocol Evaluation 
   CTP specification fully specify the protocol and its operation within 
   WTPs and ACs.  It also indicates the configuration and statistics 
   capabilities come from MIB specifications that are published by IEEE 
   that fully describe the managed objects within an WTP.  Although full 
   MIB specifications from IEEE are considered work in progress the 
   authors believe that the work done there will enable full 
   interoperability as, presumably, the specifications coming from IEEE 
   will be complete and not require any knowledge of any vendor specific 
   wireless device information. 
    
3.1.11.5          Compliance 
   CTP is compliant with this objective. 
    
3.1.12        Vendor Independence 
   This objective states that the CAPWAP protocol must not be reliant on 
   any underlying vendor implementation of hardware of either the WTP or 
   the AC. 
    
3.1.12.1          Protocol Evaluation 
   CTP does not assume any underlying hardware architecture of the WTPs 
   or the ACs.  In addition any dependency on MIB definitions in its 
   current form also does not assume any reliance on hardware 
   specifications. 
    
3.1.12.2          Compliance 
   CTP is compliant with this objective. 
    
3.1.13        Vendor Flexibility 
   The protocol must not be bound to any specific MAC. 
    
3.1.13.1          Protocol Evaluation 
   CTP has been completely implemented on hardware from at least two 
   different vendors whose wireless MAC implementations are completely 
   independent.  Given this fact as well as CTP∆s inherent agnosticity 
   of wireless implementation, CTP can be implemented without knowledge 
   of underlying vendor hardware.

3.1.13.2          Compliance 
   CTP is compliant with this objective. 
    
3.2     Desirable Objectives  
 
3.2.1        Multiple Authentication Mechanisms 
   This objective specifies the requirement that the protocol should be 
   able to support authentication mechanisms other than IEEE 802.11i. 
    
3.2.1.1          Protocol Evaluation 
   Since CTP is wireless terminal agnostic, and since the PMK key 
   exchange is generic (for example, does not assume any authentication 
   mechanism in the form of an EAP type), CTP does not prevent the 
   operation of any other authentication mechanism. 
    
3.2.1.2          Compliance 
   CTP is compliant with this objective. 
 
3.2.2        Support for Future Wireless Technologies 
   This objective states that the protocol should be able to be extended 
   to future layer 2 wireless technologies and should not be limited to 
   only supporting IEEE 802.11. 
    
3.2.2.1          Protocol Evaluation 
   The current specification lists alternative layer 2 wireless 
   technologies that and be indicated as part of the capabilities 
   exchange phase.  The protocol is sufficiently modular in that the 
   configuration, statistics and other management functions of these 
   wireless devices can be supported.  If indeed there are layer 2 
   wireless specific elements that need to be added, those are easily 
   supported by extensions to the protocol. 
    
3.2.2.2          Compliance 
   CTP is compliant with this objective. 
    
3.2.3        Support for New IEEE Requirements 
   The protocol must be able to accommodate defined changes or 
   extensions to the IEEE 802.11 specifications. 
    
3.2.3.1         Protocol Evaluation 
   Currently CTP maps 802.11 specific messages into generic messages 
   within CTP.  In other words it provides an abstraction layer to layer 
   2 wireless specific commands and functions.  As new 802.11 
   specifications arise, whether the intelligence to interpret them is 
   required in the AC or the WTP is irrelevant.  There will be work 
   required to interpret these new extensions on both the AC as well as 
   the WTP.  The CTP specification is constructed so that a new 
   extension would result in a new message type.  So it can accommodate 
   the changes as they arise.

3.2.3.2         Compliance 
   CTP is compliant with this objective. 
 
3.2.4        Interconnection Objective 
   The CAPWAP protocol must not be constrained by the underlying 
   transport technologies of the wired medium. 
    
3.2.4.1          Protocol Evaluation 
   CTP is agnostic to the underlying transport technology as it is 
   implemented as UDP.  This was done with the assumption that the 
   transport technology can carry IP packets across its medium either L2 
   or L3 network.  Currently CTP is IPv4 specific and needs to be 
   updated to be IP version agnostic as well. 
    
3.2.4.2          Compliance 
   CTP is partially compliant with this objective in terms of not having 
   specified IPv6 header types. 
    
3.2.5        Access Control 
   This objective pertains to the ability of the protocol to exchange 
   information required for access control of WTPs and wireless 
   terminals. 
    
3.2.5.1          Protocol Evaluation 
   CTP provides specific messages, e.g. CTP-MU-
   Connect/Disconnect/Authenticate messages, that control the access of 
   wireless terminals.  In addition to the actual mutual authentication 
   of WTPs and ACs, the registration phase contains a AP-ID field that 
   needs to be verified by the AC.  This field needs to be checked by 
   the AC and the mechanism for this check is not within the scope of 
   any CAPWAP work.  However, the CTP protocol itself provides this 
   identification token as a means of access control of the WTP. 
    
3.2.5.2          Compliance 
   CTP is compliant with this objective. 
    
3.3     Non-objectives 
 
   The current objectives draft states this section as ÙRejected 
   Objectivesˆ.  We have used the term ÙNon-Objectivesˆ for this section 
   based on the discussion on the WG email list. 
    
3.3.1        Support for Non-CAPWAP WTPs 
   This objective states that the CAPWAP protocol should be capable of 
   recognizing legacy WTPs and existing network management systems. 
    
3.3.1.1          Protocol Evaluation

 Internet-Draft             CTP Evaluation                   June 2005 
 
 
   This requirement is more of a feature for centralized WLAN network 
   applications and thus does not apply to the CAPWAP problem statement. 
    
3.3.1.2          Compliance 
   CTP is compliant with this objective. 
    
3.3.2        Technical Specifications 
   This objective states that WTP vendors should not have to share 
   technical specifications for hardware and software to AC vendors in 
   order for interoperability to be achieved. 
    
3.3.2.1          Protocol Evaluation 
   As discussed earlier, CTP is hardware and vendor agnostic. 
    
3.3.2.2          Compliance 
   CTP is compliant with this objective. 
 
3.4     Operator Requirements 
 
3.4.1       AP Fast Handoff 
   This objective states that the CAPWAP protocol operations must not 
   impede or obstruct the efficiency of fast handoff procedures. 
    
3.4.1.1          Protocol Evaluation 
   In the CTP protocol, the signaling of roaming events are efficiently 
   encoded in the CTP-MU messages.  Also, the 802.1x messaging is 
   centralized allowing efficient use of CPU resources at the AC.  In 
   effect, the mere existence of the centralized architecture ensures 
   that the efficiency of fast handoffs is improved rather than impeded. 
     
3.4.1.2          Compliance 
   CTP complies with this objective. 
    
4.   Compliance Table

5.   Security considerations 
    
   This document provides a self evaluation of CTP in respect to the 
   CAPWAP objectives.  The CTP draft itself has a section that 
   catalogues all the pertinent security concerns.  Therefore, in this 
   draft there are no new security considerations to be discussed.
