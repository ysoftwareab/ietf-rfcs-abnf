1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition] defines the concept of
   IETF network slices that provide connectivity coupled with a set of
   specific commitments of network resources between a number of
   endpoints over a shared network infrastructure and describes a number
   of use-cases benefiting from network slicing including:

   o 5G network slicing

   o Network wholesale services

   o Network sharing among operators

   o NFV connectivity and Data Center Interconnect

   In the document also clearly stated services that might benefit from
   the network slices include but not limited to the above use-cases.

                               Figure 1

   A cloud-network service for enterprise will involve several domains,
   each with its own controller.  MAN, Edge Cloud, IP Backbone and DC
   domains need to be coordinated in order to deliver a cloud-network
   service for enterprise.

   In Figure 1, the network operator has created two E2E network slices,
   there are two types of traffic from the client, and each traffic is
   mapped to different slice, which is NS1 and NS2.Each NS with its own
   MAN, Edge Cloud, IP Backbone and DC network slices.  The mechanism
   used to establish network slices in different domains and map the
   traffic to a network slice is outside the scope of this document.

                                  Figure 2


   There are multiple sub-company network and IP Backbone network in an
   operator IP network, each with its own slice controller.  Sub-company
   network can be the branches of the operator using slices.

   IP Backbone network slice is orchestrated by the IP Backbone network
   orchestrator, and the path is calculated through the IP Backbone
   network slice controller.

   For network slicing inside the local branch (sub-company network in
   the figure) is orchestrated through the orchestrator of the sub-
   company network.  The sub-company network slice controller performs
   unified control and path calculation for the sub-company network.
   The path calculation and control of slices related to the IP Backbone
   are sent to the IP Backbone network slice controller through the
   eastbound and westbound interfaces, and the IP Backbone network slice
   controller controls and calculates the path.
