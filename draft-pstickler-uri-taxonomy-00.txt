Internet-Draft            Extended URI Taxonomy             January 2002


1. Introduction

   RFC 2396 [15] defines two subclasses of URI: Uniform Resource
   Locators (URLs) and Uniform Resource Names (URN) as follows:

         "A URI can be further classified as a locator, a name, or both.
         The term "Uniform Resource Locator" (URL) refers to the subset
         of URI that identify resources via a representation of their
         primary access mechanism (e.g., their network "location"),
         rather than identifying the resource by name or by some other
         attribute(s) of that resource.  The term "Uniform Resource
         Name" (URN) refers to the subset of URI that are required to
         remain globally unique and persistent even when the resource
         ceases to exist or becomes unavailable."

   Thus, the URI taxonomy defined by RFC 2396 is as follows:



                             URI
                              |
                      -----------------
                      |               |
                     URL             URN



   A recent publication by the W3C [8] provides a useful discussion
   regarding the role and purpose of such classifications, and their
   significance to software applications as a formal partitioning of the
   URI space.  Per the terminology offered by this recent publication,
   this document does not strictly subscribe to either the "classical"
   or "contemporary" view, but serves as a useful resource for both.

   From the classical perspective, one may view the extended taxonomy
   defined herein as a -formal- partitioning of URI schemes such that
   each scheme is a member of one and only one URI class and an
   application may infer semantics or characteristics about URIs of a
   given scheme based on the defined semantics or characteristics of the
   URI class to which it belongs.

   From the contemporary perspective, one may view the extended taxonomy
   defined herein as an -informal- partitioning of URI schemes
   facilitating communication between humans only, allowing the shared
   semantics and characteristics of similar URI schemes to be more
   effectively expressed, but requiring that an application deal with
   each URI scheme in isolation, regardless of what URI class the scheme
   may be considered a member of.

Internet-Draft            Extended URI Taxonomy             January 2002


   In addition to URLs and URNs, this document defines an additional
   class of URI: Uniform Resource Primitives (URP), which is itself
   divided into two subclasses: Uniform Resource Terms (URT), and
   Uniform Resource Values (URV).

   Thus defining the following extended URI taxonomy:



                             URI
                              |
                      -----------------
                      |       |       |
                     URL     URP     URN
                              |
                          ---------
                          |       |
                         URT     URV




2. Uniform Resource Primitive (URP)

   URPs contstitute a class of URIs which we may describe as "fully
   resolved" or "non-dereferencable" such that they are self-contained
   and do not represent any other resource -- hence the term
   ‘primitive’.  The entire resource is embodied in the actual URI form.
   In contrast to most other URI schemes, which serve as mechanisms of
   indirection, their purpose is primarily for attribution or
   classification of other resources.

   One may make statements about those resources (e.g.  via RDF), as one
   may do about any resource, but they do not resolve or dereference to
   any other resource.  URPs constitute "WYSIWYG" URIs.  I.e.  "what you
   see (in the URI) is what you get".  This quality should become clear
   following the discussion of URTs and URVs below.

   Because a URP does not resolve to any further data than what is
   embodied in the URI itself, the concept of a fragment has no meaning
   in the context of a URP; therefore, URPs do not allow fragment
   identifiers and there is no such thing as a "URP Reference".

2.1 Uniform Resource Term (URT)

   A URT represents a member of a finite, controlled and explicitly
   enumerated vocabulary of terms, possibly constituting and organized
   as a taxonomy.



Stickler                  Expires July 17, 2002                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft            Extended URI Taxonomy             January 2002


   All URTs are defined by the same authority defining the scheme, or a
   proxy agency authorized by that authority, and the creating authority
   is (directly or indirectly) the same as for the scheme itself.

   Examples of URT schemes:

         voc: [11]

   Potential URT defined vocabularies:

         ISO 639 language codes

         ISO 3166 country codes

         Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN) [16]

         Upper Cyc Ontology [17]

         WordNet [18]



         and all vocabularies for essentially all abstract ontologies,
         XML and RDF schemata, and classificatory code sets.


2.2 Uniform Resource Value (URV)

   A URV is a lexically defined data structure.

   URVs have the unique quality that they may be defined by agents other
   than the authority defining the scheme, so long as they are defined
   in accordance with the lexical constraints defined for the scheme;
   and unlike all other classes of URI schemes, the creating authority
   is not discernable from the URI itself.

   Examples of URV schemes:

         data: [5]

         uri: [9]

         qname: [12]

         xmlns: [13]

         tdl: [10]

Internet-Draft            Extended URI Taxonomy             January 2002


   The key difference between URTs and URVs is that all values of a URT
   are defined (directly or indirectly) by a single, central authority,
   whereas URVs may be defined by anyone, so long as they conform to the
   lexical constraints defined for the scheme.

3. Basis for Distinction between URI Classes

   Although historically the distinction between URL and URN has been
   based primarily on the concepts of 'location' versus 'name', and
   although such concepts and the distinctions based on those concepts
   are still meaningful and useful, an alternative basis for
   differentiation between URI classes is adopted for this extended
   taxonomy.

   This extended taxonomy distinguishes between terminal URI classes
   according to whether the URI is dereferencable or non-dereferencable,
   and whether the URI itself denotes the agency employed in:

      1.  the definition of the URI scheme or subscheme/namespace

      2.  the creation of the URI

      3.  the interpretation of the URI

   For the purposes of this distinction, an -agency- corresponds to a
   human, organization, or computer system which is the primary
   authority and/or actor involved in any of these three roles.  An
   agency (particularly an authority) may be denoted only implicitly in
   the URI by right of owning or controlling a given web authority
   denoted explicitly by the URI.

   This gives us the following matrix, indicating where agencies are
   denoted (either implicitly or explicitly) in the URI itself:



                                    |
                         URL   URN  |  URT   URV
                        ------------|------------
       Definition         *     *   |   *     *
       Creation           *     *   |   *
       Interpretation     *         |
                                    |



   Where '*' indicates denotation and the vertical bar separates
   dereferencable schemes on the left from non-dereferencable schemes on

Internet-Draft            Extended URI Taxonomy             January 2002


   the right.

   Thus, given the HTTP URL "http://xyz.foo.com/bar", we have the
   following agencies denoted:


   Definition:     the owner of the 'http:' URI scheme
   Creation:       the owner of the subdomain 'xyz.foo.com'
   Interpretation: the computer system residing at 'xyz.foo.com'


   Given the URN "urn:foo:bar", we have the following agencies denoted:


   Definition:     the owner of the URN Namespace 'urn:foo'
   Creation:       the owner of the URN Namespace 'urn:foo'
   Interpretation: (undefined)


   Given the URT "voc://abc.com/widgets/hk28", we have the following
   agencies denoted:


   Definition:     the owner of the URT vocabulary 'voc://abc.com/widgets'
   Creation:       the owner of the URT vocabulary 'voc://abc.com/widgets'
   Interpretation: (undefined)


   Given the URV "xyz:integer:42", we have the following agencies
   denoted:


   Definition:     the owner of the URV scheme 'xyz:integer'
   Creation:       (undefined)
   Interpretation: (undefined)


   Thus, given the above basis of distinction, the primary difference
   between URLs and URNs is that URLs denote both the agency which mints
   the URI and the agency which is expected to interpret the URI;
   whereas URNs on the other hand only denote the agent minting the URI
   and leave the agent of interpretation (dereferencing) unspecified --
   which results in a more persistent identifier due to the fact that it
   is not dependent on the longevity of the validity of the location or
   identity of any given computer system for interpretation.

   While it may be argued that a URL may be interpreted by an agency
   other than that denoted in the URI itself, and thus the above

Internet-Draft            Extended URI Taxonomy             January 2002


   distinction is not meaningful, it is reasonable to consider such
   interpretation by an agency other than denoted by the URI as contrary
   to the wishes of the creator of the URI by the fact that the creator
   chose a URL rather than a URN as the class of identitifier in the
   first place.

4. Security Considerations

   This document raises no known security issues.

5. A (Re)Classification of Select URI Schemes

   The following chart suggests one possible organization of a number of
   currently defined URI Schemes in terms of the extended taxonomy
   defined in this document:
