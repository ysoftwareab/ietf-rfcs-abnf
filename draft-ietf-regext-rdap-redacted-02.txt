1.  Introduction

   This document describes an RDAP extension for explicitly identifying
   redacted RDAP response fields, using JSONPath as the default
   expression language.  A redacted RDAP field is one that has data
   removed from the RDAP response due to the lack of client privilege to
   receive the field.  This extension can be used to identify redacted
   RDAP fields in any RDAP object class, as defined in [RFC7483], or
   RDAP fields defined in RDAP extensions.  Because an RDAP response may
   exclude a field due to either the lack of data or based on the lack
   of RDAP client privileges, this extension is used to explicitly
   specify which RDAP fields are not included in the RDAP response due
   to redaction.  It thereby provides a capability for disambiguation
   between redaction and possible other reasons for data or field
   absence.

   In [RFC7482] RDAP supports both lookup and search queries, where a
   lookup query responds with a single object and a search query
   responds with a list of objects.  This document applies to redaction
   of a single object of a lookup response and in each of the objects of
   a search response.

   JSONPath, as defined in [I-D.ietf-jsonpath-base], is used as the
   default expression language to reference RDAP fields that have been
   redacted.  The redacted JSON fields will either be removed or have
   empty values in the RDAP response.  JSON is defined by [RFC8259].

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The JSON examples include extra line breaks and whitespace.  For
   instance, the JSONPath expressions are broken out into multiple lines
   when required for illustration.

3.  Redaction Methods

   Redaction in RDAP can be handled in multiple ways.  The use of
   placeholder text for the values of the RDAP fields, such as the
   placeholder text "XXXX", MUST NOT be used for redaction.  A
   placeholder text value will not match the format requirements of each
   of the RDAP fields and provides an inconsistent and unreliable
   redaction signal.  This section covers the redaction methods that can
   be used with the redaction signaling defined in Section 4.2.

   RDAP responses, as defined in [RFC7483], include a mix of JSON
   objects and JSON arrays, where JSON arrays are heavily used for
   entity objects with jCard [RFC7095].  jCard [RFC7095] is a JSON
   representation of vCard [RFC6350] that inherits its dependency on
   arrays.  An example is the vCard [RFC6350] "ADR" property / jCard
   [RFC7095] "adr" property that defines a sequence of address
   components.  According to [RFC6350], when an "ADR" property component
   value is missing, the associated component separator MUST still be
   specified.  jCard [RFC7095] extends the use of arrays with each
   individual vCard property being represented by an array of three
   fixed elements, followed by one or more additional elements.  The mix
   of JSON objects and JSON arrays impacts the methods used for
   redaction in RDAP.

   The redaction of RDAP fields fall into the two categories of
   Redaction by Removal Method (Section 3.1) and Redaction by Empty
   Value Method (Section 3.2), defined in the following sub-sections.

Internet-Draft           Redacted Fields in RDAP           November 2021


3.1.  Redaction by Removal Method

   The Redaction by Removal Method is when the RDAP field is removed
   from the RDAP response, which is the preferred method.  The Redaction
   by Removal Method can be done for all RDAP response fields other than
   response fields using the position in an array to signal the redacted
   field (e.g., the JSON arrays used with jCard [RFC7095]).  RDAP
   extensions such as JSContact in Registration Data Access Protocol
   (RDAP) JSON Responses [I-D.ietf-regext-rdap-jscontact] do not have a
   dependency on the use of positional JSON arrays and are therefore
   suited for the Redaction by Removal Method.

   When an RDAP object is redacted by removal, all of the RDAP object's
   child fields are also removed.  Only the redacted RDAP object needs
   to be referenced in the list of redacted fields, as defined in
   Section 4.2.  An example of redacting an RDAP object is removing the
   administrative contact from the RDAP response and including the
   following "redacted" member:

   "redacted": [
     {
       "name": {
         "type": "Administrative Contact"
       },
       "path": "$.entities[?(@.roles[0]=='administrative')]",
       "method": "removal"
     }
   ]

   The Redaction by Removal Method MUST NOT be used to remove a field
   using the position in a fixed length array to signal the redacted
   field.  For example, removal of an individual data field in jCard
   [RFC7095] will result in a non-conformant jCard [RFC7095] array
   definition.

3.2.  Redaction by Empty Value Method

   The Redaction by Empty Value Method is when a redacted field is not
   removed, but its value is set to an empty value, such as "" for a
   jCard [RFC7095] Text ("text") property or null for non-Text ("text")
   properties.  The empty jCard [RFC7095] values ("" or null) are
   referenced in the "redacted" member in place of the jCard [RFC7095]
   property name, such as referencing the "fn" jCard property value at
   position 3 instead of referencing the "fn" jCard property name at
   position 0.  The Redaction by Empty Value Method SHOULD be used only
   when redacting JSON response fields that use the position in an array
   to signal the redacted field (e.g., jCard [RFC7095] arrays).
   Optional jCard [RFC7095] properties SHOULD use the Redaction by

Internet-Draft           Redacted Fields in RDAP           November 2021


   Removal Method (Section 3.1) to redact the entire property.  The
   required jCard [RFC7095] "fn" property, defined in section 6.2.1 of
   vCard [RFC6350], MUST use the Redaction by Empty Value Method to
   redact the property value.  Removing the "fn" property would violate
   vCard [RFC6350] and removing the property value would violate the
   fixed array positions defined in jCard [RFC7095].

   An example of the redacted field "fn" jCard property using the
   Redaction by Empty Value Method:

   [
     "fn",
     {},
     "text",
     ""
   ]

   An example of the "redacted" member for the redacted "fn" jCard
   property value, which is array position 3:

   "redacted": [
     {
       "name": {
         "type": "Registrant Name"
       },
       "path": "$.entities[?(@.roles[0]=='registrant')].
         vcardArray[1][?(@[0]=='fn')][3]",
       "pathLang": "jsonpath",
       "method": "emptyValue",
       "reason": {
         "type": "Server policy"
       }
     }
   ]

4.  Redacted RDAP Response

4.1.  RDAP Conformance

   RDAP responses that contain values described in this document MUST
   indicate conformance with this specification by including an
   rdapConformance ([RFC7483]) value of "redacted_0.1".  The information
   needed to register this value in the RDAP Extensions Registry is
   described in Section 6.1.

   Example rdapConformance member with the redacted extension:

Internet-Draft           Redacted Fields in RDAP           November 2021


   "rdapConformance": [
     "rdap_level_0",
     "redacted_0"
   ]

4.2.  "redacted" Member

   The "redacted" member MUST be added to the RDAP response when there
   are redacted fields.  The "redacted" member is included as a member
   of the object class in a lookup response, such as the object classes
   defined in [RFC9083], and as a member of the object instances in a
   search response, such as the object instances defined in [RFC9083].
   The "redacted" member contains an array of redacted objects with the
   following child members:

   "name":  A logical name for the redacted field.  The logical name
       used for the redacted field is up to server policy.  The logical
       name is defined using an object with a "type" field denoting a
       registered redacted name (see Section 6.2) or a "description"
       field denoting an unregistered redacted name.  The registered
       redacted names and the chosen unregistered names can meet the
       needs of different RDAP services or industries.

   "path":  The JSON expression of the redacted field, using the
       expression language defined by the "pathLang" member.  The JSON
       expression references a removed JSON field or an empty field
       value based on Section 3.

   "pathLang":  OPTIONAL JSON path expression language used, with the
       default value of "jsonpath" for JSONPath
       ([I-D.ietf-jsonpath-base]).  Other JSON path expression languages
       MAY be used based on server policy.

   "method":  OPTIONAL redaction method used with "removal" indicating
       the Redaction By Removed Method (Section 3.1) and "emptyValue"
       indicating the Redaction by Empty Value Method (Section 3.2),
       with the default value of "removal".

   "reason":  OPTIONAL human readable reason(s) for the redacted field
       in the language defined by the [RFC7483] "lang" member.  The
       default language is "en" if the [RFC7483] "lang" member is not
       specified.  The reason is defined using an object with an
       OPTIONAL "type" field denoting a registered redacted reason (see
       see Section 6.2) and an OPTIONAL "description" field denoting an
       unregistered redacted reason.  The "description" field MUST NOT
       be a client processing dependency.

   Example unredacted version of an RDAP lookup response:

5.  JSONPath Considerations

   JSONPath [I-D.ietf-jsonpath-base] is the default JSON path expression
   language.  This section covers considerations for servers using
   [I-D.ietf-jsonpath-base] to identify redacted RDAP fields with the
   "path" member of redacted objects in the "redacted" member.  The list
   of JSONPath considerations include:

   1.  Use absolute paths with the '$' JSONPath element.  An example is
       "$.handle" for the "Registry Domain ID" in a lookup response or
       "$.domainSearchResults[0].handle" in a search response.
   2.  Validate a JSONPath expression using a non-redacted RDAP
       response, where evaluating the expression results in returning
       the redacted field.
   3.  Reference the removed object field when redacting an entire
       object by the Redaction by Removal Method (Section 3.1), where
       all of the object's child fields are explicitly removed.  An
       example is "$.entities[?(@.roles[0]=='administrative')]" for the
       entire "Administrative Contact".
   4.  When an entity has multiple roles, include "redacted" members for
       each role using the role index.  This will result in duplicate
       "redacted" members, but will enable the client to treat redaction
       consistently when there is a single role per entity or multiple
       roles per entity.  An example is when the "roles" member has the
       value '["registrant","administrative"]', redacting the "name"

Internet-Draft           Redacted Fields in RDAP           November 2021


       member of the entity will result in two "redacted" members with
       the JSONPath expressions "$.entities[?(@.roles[0]=='registrant')]
       .vcardArray[1][?(@[0]=='fn')][3]" and "$.entities[?(@.roles[1]=='
       administrative')].vcardArray[1][?(@[0]=='fn')][3]".
   5.  Reference the removed field when using the Redaction by Removal
       Method (Section 3.1).  An example is "$.handle" for the "Registry
       Domain ID".
   6.  Reference index 0 of the jCard [RFC7095] property array, which is
       the jCard [RFC7095] "name" property, with a filter expression
       containing the name of the field, when redacting a jCard
       [RFC7095] field using the Redaction by Removal Method
       (Section 3.1).  An example is "$.entities[?(@.roles[0]=='registra
       nt')].vcardArray[1][?(@[0]=='email')]" for the "Registrant
       Email".
   7.  Reference jCard [RFC7095] field value or values redacted by array
       index 3 and greater, when redacting a jCard [RFC7095] field using
       the Redaction by Empty Value Method (Section 3.2).  The jCard
       [RFC7095] property array index 3 and greater contain the property
       values, where the property values set with an empty value are
       referenced directly in place of the jCard [RFC7095] property
       name.  Servers can then systematically redact jCard [RFC7095]
       field value or values based on the JSONPath expressions and
       clients will directly know which jCard [RFC7095] property values
       have been redacted.  An example is "$.entities[?(@.roles[0]=='reg
       istrant')].vcardArray[1][?(@[0]=='fn')][3]" for the "Registrant
       Name" or "$.entities[?(@.roles[0]=='registrant')].vcardArray[1][?
       (@[0]=='adr')][3][5]" for the "Registrant Postal Code".
   8.  RDAP extensions should define any special JSONPath considerations
       required to identify redacted RDAP fields if these considerations
       are insufficient.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  RDAP Extensions Registry

   IANA is requested to register the following value in the RDAP
   Extensions Registry:

   Extension identifier:  redacted_0.1
   Registry operator:  Any
   Published specification:  This document.
   Contact:  IESG <iesg@ietf.org>
   Intended usage:  This extension identifies the redacted fields in an
      RDAP response.

6.2.  JSON Values Registry

   Section 10.2 of [RFC9083] defines the JSON Values Registry with pre-
   defined Type field values and the use of the "Expert Review" policy
   defined in [RFC8126].  Two new JSON Values Registry Type field values
   are used to register pre-defined redacted name and reason values:

   "redacted name":  Redacted name being registered.  The registered
       redacted name is referenced using the "type" field of the
       redacted "name" field.

   "redacted reason":  Redacted reason being registered.  The registered
       redacted reason is referenced using the "type" field of the
       redacted "reason" field.

7.  Security Considerations

   The server including a redacted signal provides an unauthorized
   client additional information related to the existence of data.
   Servers MAY exclude the redacted members for RDAP fields that are
   considered a privacy issue in providing a data existence signal.

Appendix A.  Change History

A.1.  Change from 00 to 01

Internet-Draft           Redacted Fields in RDAP           November 2021


   1.  Changed rdapConformance to use pointed "redacted_0.1" value to
       support structural changes of the extension up to the target of
       "redacted_1.0".
   2.  Updates based on the Gustavo Lozano feedback:
       1.  Updated the language to change the special treatment of jCard
           to be more generic for future RDAP extensions that leverage
           fixed length JSON arrays.
       2.  Added "RDAP extensions should define any special JSONPath
           considerations required to identify redacted RDAP fields if
           the these considerations are insufficient." to the JSONPath
           Considerations section to generalize it.
   3.  Updates based on the Marc Blanchet feedback:
       1.  Added a reference to draft-ietf-regext-rdap-jscontact as an
           example of an RDAP extension that is suited for the Redaction
           by Removal Method based on the lack of dependency on
           positional JSON arrays.
       2.  Added support for registered and unregistered (free-form)
           redaction reasons by changing the "reason" property to be a
           JSON object with the "type" and "description" properties.
           The "type" property includes registration in the IANA JSON
           Values Registry.
       3.  Added a "JSON Values Registry" section in the IANA
           Considersations section to define the "redaction reason" JSON
           Values Registry Type values to support the registration of
           redaction reasons.
   4.  Updates based on the Mario Loffredo feedback:
       1.  Added support for registered and unregistered (free-form)
           redaction names by changing the "reason" property to be a
           JSON object with the "type" and "description" properties.
           The "type" property includes registration in the IANA JSON
           Values Registry.
       2.  Added a "JSON Values Registry" section in the IANA
           Considersations section to define the "redaction name" JSON
           Values Registry Type values to support the registration of
           redaction names.
       3.  Added a JSONPath Considerations item associated with handling
           entities with multiple roles.
       4.  Added language to restrict the extension to responses.

A.2.  Change from 01 to 02

   1.  Updates to add support for RDAP search responses:
       1.  Replaced "RDAP lookup response" with "RDAP response"
           throughout the draft to expand the scope to include search.
       2.  Updated the description in the second paragraph of the
           Introduction to cover both a lookup response and a search
           response.

Internet-Draft           Redacted Fields in RDAP           November 2021


       3.  Added an example of the use of an absoluate path for a search
           response to the "JSONPath Considerations" section.
       4.  Added a description of the placement of the "redacted" member
           in a lookup response and a search response in the ""redacted"
           Member" section.
       5.  Added an example of an unredacted search response and a
           redacted search response in the ""redacted" Member" section.
