     The  VAN  gateway  is  a  new   facility   currently   under

development  for the internet community.  Its intended purpose is

to  allow  interconnection  of  the  ARPANET  and  therefore  the

Internet  with  Telenet,  but  it also introduces a new mechanism

whose failure or misuse can seriously affect the system.  The key

problem  with  use  of  the VAN gateway is to allow and encourage

using it for legitimate purposes, while preventing utilization by

unauthorized  users  or  as  a  result  of a software or hardware

failure in the networks involved.


     There are two aspects to this problem.  The first control on

the  gateway  usage  must  be  to  assure  that the packets being

handled  are  legitimate,  in  that  they  are  associated   with

authorized  users.   This  is  a specific example of the need for

mechanisms  which  have  been  discussed  at  various  times   as

"restricted routing" mechanisms.


     The second control problem is to assure that the gateway  is

being  used  as  intended, with a reasonable level of traffic for

the  function  being  performed.   Even  if  packets  are   being

processed  for  authorized  users,  it  is  possible for failures

within the routing system or host software, for example, to cause

packets  to  loop  endlessly.   Failures of the network protocols

could similarly cause duplicate packets to be sent needlessly.

     In both cases, the concern results from the  highly  visible

impact which use of Telenet incurs, since charges are computed on

a per-packet basis.  However, the same issues are inherent in the

Catenet  itself, in that misuse of the network consumes resources

which are then unavailable for legitimate use.  Thus the  problem

of  managing  use  of  the  gateway  is most critical for the VAN

gateway, but applies as well to all gateways, and in fact to  any

shared resource.


     In the initial implementation of the VAN  gateway,  resource

management is being provided by use of tables which enumerate the

authorized users of the gateway.   These  users  are  simply  the

addresses of the hosts, both on the ARPANET (Catenet) side and on

the Telenet side, which will be acceptable as  valid  source  and

destination  addresses of packets which transit the gateway.  All

other  packets  which  are  received  by  the  gateway  will   be

discarded.


     In the  internet  architecture,  the  Telenet  side  of  the

gateway  appears  as a single network to the internet mechanisms.

The gateway contains a table which maps artificial host addresses

on  that  network  into  real 14-digit Telenet/X.25 addresses, in

much the same way as other networks  convert  internet  addresses

into  addresses  for  their  particular  attached  network.  X.25

virtual circuits are only permitted between the gateway and  X.25

hosts   which  are  present  in  this  translation  table,  which

effectively defines the set of authorized gateway  users  in  the

X.25 community.


     No similar table is necessary for translation  of  addresses

on  the  ARPANET  side  of the gateway, since this translation is

well defined by the internet protocol.   Without  any  additional

mechanisms,  this  would  permit  any ARPANET host to use the VAN

gateway.  In addition,  since  gateways  to  other  networks  are

simply  ARPANET  hosts, this would permit any host on the Catenet

to use the VAN gateway.


     To restrict the user community of the VAN gateway, a  second

table  is provided, which enumerates all internet addresses which

are acceptable as sources or destinations on the ARPANET side  of

the  gateway.   Each  internet  datagram  which  arrives from the

ARPANET or Telenet is checked  to  assure  that  the  source  and

destination addresses in the internet header are listed in one of

the two tables which define the set of hosts which are  permitted

to use the VAN gateway.


     The table entries will be set  up  directly  by  DARPA.   In

selecting  the  set  of  valid hosts, the reliability of the data

presented to the gateway should be considered.

     In  particular,  we  note  that  there  is   a   significant

difference  in  the  addresses  presented  at  the gateway in the

internet header of each packet.  If such an address is in fact on

the  ARPANET,  the  gateway  can verify it by comparison with the

address supplied by the IMP in the ARPANET leader of the  packet.

For packets sent to the ARPANET, one can similarly expect the IMP

subnet to deliver the packet to the host specified in the ARPANET

leader.


     If the address of a packet handled  by  the  gateway  is  on

another   component   network  of  the  Catenet,  the  packet  is

necessarily handled through one or more gateways.   The  internet

structure  permits gateways to freely enter the system.  Gateways

are in general under the control of the organization  which  owns

them  and/or  the  attached  network.  Gateways in general do not

check the addresses in the internet headers of packets which they

process,  so  it  is  possible  for  malfunctioning  hardware  or

software to emit  packets  with  incorrect  addresses.   If  such

addresses  happen  to be present in the VAN gateway tables, these

packets will be processed by the VAN gateway.


     The impact of this situation on the policy for allowing  use

of  the  VAN  gateway  is  that  hosts on networks other than the

ARPANET are to be considered somewhat less reliable in  terms  of

enforcement  of  the usage policy.  The mechanisms in the initial

VAN gateway implementation will provide some  degree  of  control

over  the  use of the gateway, but these mechanisms are not to be

considered appropriate or complete in the general sense, and they

are  not  proof  against failures.  These mechanisms are intended

only as an interim measure.


     We suggest that further development  work  on  the  internet

gateway  system,  of which the VAN gateway is a component, should

address the problems of resource control at the  internet  system

level.  Any mechanism which restricts the usage of a gateway must

be designed in conjunction with other network mechanisms, such as

routing, flow control, load sharing, and error control.


     As an example, we can consider a hypothetical  configuration

in  which  two  VAN  gateways  are connected to Telenet, one from

ARPANET, and the other from SATNET, to  support  traffic  between

Telenet  users  and  hosts  on  ARPANET  or  SATNET.   Only these

user/hosts would be listed in the VAN gateway tables.


     Since the VAN gateways  are  participants  in  the  internet

routing  mechanisms,  failure  of the gateway between ARPANET and

SATNET would cause the  system  to  recognize  the  path  through

TELENET,  as  a  transit  network, as a viable route for ARPANET-

SATNET traffic.  However, this traffic would be discarded at  the

VAN gateway because the addresses are not listed in its tables.

     This scenario will be avoided  by  preventing  the  two  VAN

gateways  from  being  "neighbors" for routing purposes, which is

acceptable  only  in  restricted  configurations.   The   general

problem  results  from the usage restrictions at the VAN gateway,

which makes the path a valid route for one class of packets,  but

invalid  for other classes.  The current routing mechanism cannot

handle this situation.


     In addition, the effect of the usage restrictions on  future

mechanisms for handling partitioned networks, and load sharing of

gateway paths, must be investigated.


     We have two  mechanisms  to  propose  for  consideration  as

mechanisms  to  attack  this  problem.   The  first is a resource

control model which is a result  of  the  TIP  Login  work.   The

second  involves the use of performance models, which monitor use

of resources to determine if unexpected behavior  occurs.   These

two  mechanisms can be introduced to work more effectively in the

VAN gateway problem.


     The architecture for the TIP Login system identifies several

abstract modules which interact to implement the resource control

functions.  A  "Control  Point"  is  the  module  which  directly

controls  the use of a resource.  It is responsible for detecting

an attempt to use  some  resource,  collecting  such  information




                               -6-


IEN-181                              Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc.
                                                     Jack Haverty



which  identifies who is trying to use the resource and what they

are trying to do, and then  permitting  or  denying  use  of  the

resource.   The  decision  concerning whether or not a particular

usage is allowed is made by  a  "Decision  Module."  This  module

takes  the information supplied by the Control Point, and applies

the  algorithm  which  defines   the   resource   usage   policy.

Typically,  and  particularly in the Tip Login case, the Decision

Module will obtain more information  about  the  particular  user

and/or  resource involved in the decision, by using a distributed

database system.


     In the TIP Login system, the Control Point is at  each  TIP.

Decision  Modules  are  located  in  special-purpose  hosts.  The

database system is present in those hosts as well  as  on  larger

database-maintenance  hosts, where tools to manipulate and modify

the database exist.  Typically the Decision Module identifies the

particular  individual  attempting  to use a TIP, and retrieves a

record of information specific to that individual, which  defines

his authorizations (or lack thereof).


     Much of this mechanism should prove to be useful as a  basis

for  control  of gateways as well.  In such a system, the control

points would be at the gateways.  Decision Modules might also  be

at  the  gateways,  if  decisions  must  be  made on each packet.

Decisions might be based on source or destination  addresses,  or



                               -7-

on the identify of the individual responsible for the packet.  We

suggest that this approach be considered for further research.


     A problem which is not  being  addressed  currently  is  the

second  control  problem mentioned earlier, namely the monitoring

of the use of some resource by an authorized user,  to  guarantee

that  the resource is being used as intended.  In the VAN gateway

case,  for  example,  a  malfunctioning  TCP  might  cause   many

unnecessary  packets to be handled, but since they are associated

with authorized addresses, no control is applied.  In addition to

the  obvious  cost  and performance penalties, lack of monitoring

precludes  the  use  of  policies  which  grant  limited  use  of

resources  to,  for example, allow some users to handle only low-

throughput traffic, or low priority traffic.  We believe that the

use  of  performance models, embedded within the gateways and for

hosts, is a promising direction for attacking this problem.


     Limitations of the current LSI-11 implementation of the  VAN

gateway  are  likely to preclude any significant testing of these

approaches.  We  have  been  pursuing  these  ideas  as  research

issues,  which  have  surfaced  during the current implementation

efforts.
