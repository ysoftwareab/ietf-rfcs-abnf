  Kirstein: EPSS and SATNET will have X.25 interfaces but there is no
  plan for an X.25 interface to the ARPANET.

  Cerf: The issue of secure internetting is postponed.

  Cerf: There is consideration of an effort to develop a new ftp, but
  there is no plan as yet.

  Kirstein: FAX might be worked into the speech and video conferencing
  system.

IEN # 3                                           INTERNET Meeting Notes



  Kirstein:  Are LLL or Commercial nets to be involved in internet
  experiments?

  Cerf: LLL is interested in TCP for the local to Livermore Octopus net
  not the CTR net.

  Cerf: No current plans to get commerical nets involved.

  Kirstein: What is happening about AUTODIN II and ARPANET as described
  at TCP Meeting?

  Cerf: That plan is no longer active, and it is not expected that there
  will be any move to get people off the ARPANET until 1980, after that
  AUTODIN II service may be offered instead of ARPANET on a customer by
  customer basis.

  Kirstein: It seems more likely that university type users will have to
  go to a commerical net than get on AUTODIN II, so shouldn't we be
  exploring internetting with commercial nets now?

Issues in Internetting - Andrew Hinchley & Chris Bennett

  Hinchley & Bennett discussed the paper (PSPWN 76, INDRA 637) "Issues
  in the Interconnection of Datagram Networks" that was distributed
  prior to the meeting.

  Hinchley: there are three catagories of interconnections:

    1) ARPA like datagram networks,

    2) PTTs X.25 networks, note that the PTTs are moving very fast with
    a model of an internetwork system composed of a small number of very
    large national networks,

    3) Interconnection of private networks via public X.25 networks.

    The SATNET experience is the basis for these (PSPWN 76) comments.

  Cerf: Is a gateway a piece of hardware physically connected to two or



Section 1.4.1                                                   [page 6]

                                                               18 Aug 77
IEN # 3                                           INTERNET Meeting Notes



  more networks, or is it pair(s) of software modules connected by
  physically complicated networks ?

  Kirstein: We should be more aware of what is going to be possible with
  PTT provided "virtual call networks".

  Bennett: Addressing is a topic discussed in the memo.

  Cerf: Up to now we have not had names for gateways, but now we may
  need names if gateway control centers are to communicate directly with
  gateways.

  Cerf and Crocker discuss gateway models, one point was that one should
  try a model with a three or more connected gateways since sometimes a
  two connected model may make things seem simpler than they really are,
  another point is that a gateway is a kind of a forwarder, and Crocker
  argues that the forwarder is logically a network.

  Postel: An address is just a string of bits, with each address parser
  consuming part of the string, to give a gateway an address reserve one
  value of the set of values representable in the bits the gateway
  parses, that reserved value means "here".

  Kirstein expressed concern about the address space in the individual
  networks.  Also concerned about translations necessary when going
  between datagram and virtual call networks.

  Cerf: Does the way a thing is named specify the way one gets to it?
  Especially if a thing is multi-hommed?

  Shoch: One way is all gates are in the same net and have exactly one
  address. Another way is that a gateway has distinct host address on
  each net it is connected to.

  Cerf: If the gateway control center has to talk to the gateway and the
  gateway has two names, which name does the control center use?

  Shoch: Someone has to take responsibility for choosing.

  Jacobs: Where do the global unique names come from?


Section 1.4.1                                                   [page 7]

                                                               18 Aug 77
IEN # 3                                           INTERNET Meeting Notes



  Postel: They are external. We always have a unique description,
  usually by location, for objects. The gateway control center will have
  to have for each gateway a unique (external) name, and associated with
  that a list of internal addresses.

  Cerf designates that there be a committee to study addressing and
  naming of gateways to (1) figure out what things there are, and (2)
  figure out how to address them.  Crocker is chairman.

  Bennett: Routing in the Internet is discussed in PSPWN 76.  The main
  ideas are that adaptive routing in internet is not likely to be much
  good due to the larger delays in information propagation.  Fixed
  routing with a number of alternatives (this is also called "Explicit
  Path Routing") might be useful. [Naylor says this is explored by IBM
  Zurich.] Could use alternate routing in a event driven form to recover
  from service outages. One issue is what to base the adaptation on.

  Postel: Most of the things normally used could get washed out by local
  traffic.

  Crocker: Perhaps there are some things...

  Postel: for example queue lengths in the gateways.

  Cerf: Adaptive routing is not a substitute for congestion control.

  Jacobs: The information available to a gateway includs both facts
  about its directly attached networks and information received from
  other gateways.

  Cerf: Gatways may have to exchange information about what paths are
  viable. If one packet from a gateway to a host in the ARPANET results
  in a "host dead" error what does the gateway do about other packets to
  the ARPANET? We should avoid having a lot of state information in the
  gateways.

  Postel: What happens when the ARPANET says to a gateway "host dead"?

  Jacobs: Nothing.

IEN # 3                                           INTERNET Meeting Notes



  Cerf: Try to pass an error message back to source TCP. We have no
  conventions for this as yet.

  Mathis: Out thinking has been: Gateways do routing; TCPs do not do
  routing.

  Cohen: Routing algorithms need to be smarter.

  Hinchley: Flow Control Possibilities

    1) No control at gateway level (expect end-to-end control to take
    care of any problems)

    2) Gatway to Gateway control

    3) Terminating Gateway Control (source - desination  gateways
    control flow)

    4) X7X virtual circuit control

    This is a range of possibilities.

  Postel favors a hop by hop (that is gate by gate) flow control.

  Cohen: Why should there be a single type of flow control? The type of
  service (drops, streams, floods) should get different kinds of flow
  control.

  Jacobs: In SATNET there are a whole rage of stratagies from try once
  to try very hard to get a message through.

  There occured at this point a discussion of the cost of hop by hop
  acknowledgements.

  Jacobs: This should all be in terms of bump to bump, that is  a
  gateway consist of a bump for each connected network and a core, any
  network is between a pair of bumps, and the bumps should decide how
  much error control etc is needed across that network.

  There was a discussion of status information, particularly error

IEN # 3                                           INTERNET Meeting Notes



  reports. If a gateway  has a problem then it is an internet error and
  "the internet" ought to tell the source about it. If a destination
  host has a problem then a service center could know the problem and a
  query  to the services center could tell the source what is happening.

  Hinchley: Gateway Control, Once gateways get above a certain level of
  complexity there needs to be a control function, that suggest that the
  reshould be a gateway control language which is standard throught the
  internet.

Gateway Monitoring - Bob Bressler

  Bressler described the current gateway monitoring center as a fairly
  simple program that summarized reports from the SIMP and some other
  gateway. The information reported was:

    number of messages sent and received on each port of each gateway
    and the number of messages dropped by the gateway

  The gateways spontaneously generate the reports to the control center,
  the control center curently sends no messages to the gateways.  There
  are data generators and data sinks in the gateways now controled by
  XNET a ddt like cross net debugger.

  Kirstein: One of the simplest services one could provide is reliable
  delivery but allow duplicates to be delivered as well.

  Hinchley: What common functions can be listed?

    restart
    reload
    run a diagnostic
    update routing information

  Shoch: Gateways exchange routing tables perodically gratuitously. Many
  processes in a gateway for example time server, name lookup server,
  boot loaders, measurement process, echo server, source, sink, trace.

  Shoch: There is a distinction between Routing, Addressing, and Naming.

IEN # 3                                           INTERNET Meeting Notes



  Kirstein: There will need to be several monitoring centers. There may
  be a central control center that forwards suggestion for control to
  national control centers.

  Burchfiel: No gateway in the ARPANET currently does fragmentation.

Type of Service Issues - Danny Cohen

  Cohen discussed Type of Service issues. He suggests the following
  dimensions to service selection:

    priority
    relibility/cost
    delay/cost
    Floods / Streams / Drops
    Message/Wire
    Sort Messages
    Acknowledgement / Negative acknowledgement/ No acknowledgement
    Security
    Synchronization
    Multidestination addressing
    End of Letter
      Buffer Runout
      Receiver Wakeup

  Cohen: Whether ACK or NACK or both or neither are used should depend
  on statistics.

  Jacobs: The Host-SIMP protocol paper may be relevant.

  Hoversten: Is the user helping the network by telling it what type of
  demands the user is going to make?

Internet Mail Service - Steve Crocker

  Crocker discussed a model of how to make mail services available in
  the internet system in a straightforward way.  Also of interest is
  possibility for authentication and privacy.

Wrap Up - Vint Cerf

  Binders for an Internet Notebook were distributed, and Cerf explaind
  the intention to use it to collect the current information for
  internet experements.  Jon Postel is the Notebook coordinator.

  Cerf summarized as follows:

    Addressing alternatives need to be written down - assigned Steve
    Crocker to coordinate. Please supply him with your thoughts.  What
    objects exist and what names should they have.  John Shoch will
    provide a one page note on nomenclature.  A Gateway Specification is
    to be prepared by Bob Bressler.  Cerf will distribute a current
    version of the X.25 specification.  Kirstein will distribute a
    document on the UCL X.25 experiments.
