     1  Introduction

          The purpose of this report is to describe the implementation
     of network software for the VAX-11/780 * running UNIX. ** This is
     being  done  as  part of the VAX-UNIX Networking Support Project.
     The overall purpose of this effort is to provide  the  capability
     for  the  VAX  to  communicate  with  other computers via packet-
     switching networks,  such  as  the  ARPANET.   Specifically,  the
     project  centers  around  an  implementation  of the DoD standard
     host-host protocol, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)  [4].
     TCP  allows communication with ARPANET hosts, as well as hosts on
     networks outside the ARPANET, by its  use  of  the  DoD  standard
     Internet  Protocol  (IP) [3].  The implementation is designed for
     the VAX, running VM/UNIX, the   modified  version  of  UNIX  32/V
     developed  at  the  University of California, Berkeley [1].  This
     version of UNIX includes virtual paging capabilities.

          In the following paragraphs, we will discuss  some  features
     and design goals of the implementation, and its organization.



     2  Features of the Implementation

     2.1  Protocol Dependent Features

     2.1.1  Separation of Protocol Layers

          The  TCP  software  that  we  are  developing  for  the  VAX
     incorporates    several    important    features.    First,   the
     implementation provides for separation of  the  various  protocol
     layers  so  that  they  can  be accessed independently by various
     applications. (1) Thus, there is a capability for access  to  the
     TCP  level,  which  will provide complete, reliable, multiplexed,
     host-host communications connections.  In addition, the IP  level
     is also accessible for applications other than TCP, which require
     its  internet  addressing   and   data   fragmentation/reassembly
     services.   Finally,  the  implementation also allows independent
     access to the local network  interface  (in  this  case,  to  the
     ARPANET,  whose  host interface is defined in BBN Report No. 1822

     (1) In this context, the terms application and user refer to  any
     software that is a user of lower level networking services. Thus,
     programs such as FTP and TELNET can  be  considered  applications
     when  viewed  from the TCP level, and TCP itself may be viewed as
     an application from the IP level.

     [2])   in  a  "raw"  fashion,  for  software  which   wishes   to
     communicate with hosts on the local network and do its own higher
     level protocol processing.



     2.1.2  Protocol Functions

          Another feature of the implementation is to provide the full
     functionality  of  each  level  of  protocol  (TCP  and  IP),  as
     described in their specifications [3,4].  Thus, on the TCP level,
     features   such   as   the   flow  control  mechanism  (windows),
     precedence, and security levels will be  supported.   On  the  IP
     level,  datagram  fragmentation and reassembly will be supported,
     as well  as  IP  option  processing,  gateway-host  flow  control
     (source-quenching)   and   routing   updates.    However,  it  is
     anticipated that some of these  features  (such  as  handling  IP
     gateway-host  routing  updates, and IP option processing) will be
     implemented in later stages  of  development,  after  more  basic
     features     (such     as     TCP    flow    control    and    IP
     fragmentation/reassembly) are debugged.



     2.2  Operation System Dependent Features

     2.2.1  Kernel Resident Networking Software

          There are several features of the implementation  which  are
     operating  system  dependent.  The most important of these is the
     fact that the networking software is  being  implemented  in  the
     UNIX kernel as a permanently resident system process, rather than
     a swappable user level process.

          This organization has several  implications  which  bear  on
     performance.    The   most  obvious  effect  is  that  since  the
     networking software is always resident, it can  more  efficiently
     respond  to  network  and  user initiated events, as it is always
     available to service such events and need not be swapped in.   In
     addition,  residence  in the kernel removes the burden of the use
     of potentially inefficient interprocess communication mechanisms,
     such  as  pipes and ports, since simpler data structures, such as
     globally available queues, can be used to transmit  data  between
     the network and user processes.  Kernel provided services, (e.g.,
     timers and memory allocation) also become much  easier  and  more
     efficient to use.

          The large address space of the VAX makes  this  organization
     practical  and  allows  the  avoidance of expedients like the NCP
     split  kernel/user  process  implementation,   that   have   been
     necessary  in  previous UNIX networking software on machines with
     limited address space, like the PDP 11/70.  It is hoped that  the
     kernel  resident  approach  will  contribute  to  the  speed  and
     efficiency of this TCP.



     2.2.2  User Interface

          Use of the "traditional" UNIX file oriented  user  interface
     is   another   operating   system   dependent   feature  of  this
     implementation.  The user will access  the  network  software  by
     means  of  standard system file I/O calls: open, close, read, and
     write.  This entails modification of certain of  these  calls  to
     accommodate  the  extra information needed to open and maintain a
     connection.   In  addition,  the  communication  of   exceptional
     conditions to the user (such as the foreign host going down) must
     also be accommodated by extension of the standard  system  calls.
     In  the  case  of open, for example, use of the call's mode field
     will  be  extended  to  accommodate  a  pointer  to  a  parameter
     structure.   In  the  case  of exceptional conditions, the return
     code for reads and writes will be used to signal the presence  of
     exceptional conditions, much like an error.  An additional status
     call (ioctl) will be provided for the user to determine  detailed
     information  about  the  nature of the condition, and the general
     status of the connection.

          In this way, the necessary additional information needed  to
     maintain  network  communications  will be supported, while still
     allowing  the  use  of  the  functionality  that  the  UNIX  file
     interface provides, such as the pipe mechanism.

          In the initial versions, this interface will be the standard
     UNIX  blocking  I/O  mechanism.  Thus, outstanding reads for data
     which has not been accepted from the  foreign  host,  and  writes
     which  exceed the buffering resources of a connection will block.
     It is  expected  that  the  await/capacity  mechanism,  currently
     available  for  Version  6  systems, will be added to the VM/UNIX
     kernel in the near future.  These non-blocking I/O  modifications
     will be supported by the network software, relieving the blocking
     restriction.

     3  Design Goals

          Several  design  goals  have  been   formulated   for   this
     implementation.    Among  these  goals  are  efficiency  and  low
     operating system overhead, promoted by a kernel resident  network
     process,  which  allows  for  reduced  process  and  interprocess
     communication overhead.

          Another goal of the implementation is to reduce  the  amount
     of  extraneous  data  copying  in  handling  network traffic.  To
     achieve this, a buffer data structure has been adopted which  has
     the  following  characteristics:   intermediate size (128 bytes);
     low overhead (10 bytes of control information  per  buffer);  and
     flexibility  in  data handling through the use of data offset and
     length fields, which reduce the amount of data  copying  required
     for operations like IP fragment reassembly and TCP sequence space
     manipulations.

          The use of queueing between the various software levels  has
     been limited in the implementation by processing incoming network
     data to the highest level possible as soon as possible.  Thus, an
     unfragmented  message coming from the network is passed to the IP
     and TCP levels, with queueing taking place at the  device  driver
     only  until  the  message  has  been fully read from the network.
     Similarly,  on  the  output  side,  data  transmission  is   only
     attempted  when  the software is reasonably certain that the data
     will be accepted by the network.

          Finally, it is planned that the  inclusion  of  the  network
     software  will entail relatively little modification of the basic
     kernel  code  beyond  that  provided  by  Berkeley.    The   only
     modifications to kernel code outside the network software will be
     slight changes to the file I/O system calls to support  the  user
     interface  described  above.   In  addition,  an extension to the
     virtual page map data structure in low core will be necessary  to
     support  the  memory  allocation  scheme,  which makes use of the
     kernel's page frame allocation mechanisms.

     4.1.1  Local Network Interface

          The network software can be  viewed  as  a  kernel  resident
     system  process,  much  like  the  scheduler  and  page daemon of
     Berkeley VM/UNIX.  This process is initiated as part  of  network
     initialization.   A diagram of its control and data flow is shown
     in Figure 1.

     Its main flow of control is an input loop which is activated (via
     wakeup)  by  the network interface device driver when an incoming
     message has been completely read from the network.  (It can  also
     be  awakened  by TCP user or timer events, described below.)  The
     message is then taken from an input queue and dispatched  on  the
     basis  of  local  network format (e.g., 1822 leader link number).
     ARPANET imp-host messages (RFNMs, incompletes,  imp/host  status)

     are  handled  at  this  level.   For other types of messages, the
     local network level input handler  calls  higher  level  "message
     handlers."   The  "standard  message  handler"  is  the  IP input
     routine.  Handlers for other protocols at  this  level  (such  as
     UNIX  NCP)  may  be accommodated in either of two ways.  First, a
     "raw message" service is available which simply  queues  data  on
     specified links to/from the local network.  By reading or writing
     on a connection opened for  this  service,  a  user  process  may
     handle    its    own   higher   level   protocol   communication.
     Alternatively, for frequently used protocols, a new  handler  may
     be defined in the kernel and called directly.



     4.1.2  Internet Protocol

          At the  IP  level,  the  fragment  reassembly  algorithm  is
     executed.  Unfragmented messages with valid IP leaders are passed
     to the higher level protocol handler in a manner similar  to  the
     lower  level  dispatch,  but  on the basis of IP protocol number.
     The  "standard  handler"  is  TCP.   Another   protocol   handler
     interprets  IP  gateway-host  flow  control  and  routing  update
     messages.

          Fragmented messages are  placed  on  a  fragment  reassembly
     queue,  where  incoming  fragments  are  separated  by source and
     destination  address,  protocol  number,  and  IP  identification
     field.   For  each  "connection"  (as defined by these fields), a
     linked list of fragments is maintained, tagged by fragment offset
     start  and  end  byte  numbers.   As  fragments are received, the
     proper list is found (or a new  one  is  created),  and  the  new
     fragment  is  merged  in  by comparing start and end byte numbers
     with those of fragments already on the list.  Duplicate  data  is
     thrown  away.   A  timer  is  associated  with  this  queue,  and
     incomplete messages which remain after timeout  are  dropped  and
     their  storage  is  freed.   Completed messages are passed to the
     next level.



     4.1.3  TCP Level

          At the TCP level, incoming datagrams are processed via calls
     to  a  "TCP machine."  This is the TCP itself, which is organized
     as a finite state machine whose states are  roughly  the  various
     states  of  the  protocol  as  defined  in  [4], and whose inputs
     include    incoming    data    from     the     network,     user
     open/close/read/write  requests, and timer events. Input from the
     network is handled directly, passing through the above  described



                                    -6-

     VAX-UNIX Networking                                 January, 1981

     levels.   User  requests  and  timer events are handled through a
     work queue.

          When a user process executes a network  request  via  system
     call,  the relevant data (on a read or write) is copied from user
     to kernel space (or vice versa), a work entry  is  enqueued,  and
     the   network   process  is  awakened.   Similarly,  when  timers
     associated with TCP (such as the retransmission  timer)  go  off,
     timer work requests are enqueued and the network input process is
     awakened.  Once awakened, it checks for the presence of completed
     messages  from  the  network interface and processes them.  After
     these inputs are processed, the TCP machine is called  to  handle
     any  outstanding requests on the work queue.  The network process
     then sleeps, waiting for more network  input  or  work  requests.
     Thus,  the TCP machine may be called directly with network input,
     or awakened indirectly to check its work queue for user and timer
     requests.

          After reset  processing  and  sequence  and  acknowledgement
     number  validation,  acceptable  received  data  is sequenced and
     placed on the receive queue. This sequencing process  is  similar
     to  the  IP  fragment reassembly algorithm described above.  Data
     placed on  this  queue  is  acknowledged  to  the  foreign  host.
     Received  data  whose  sequence  numbers  lie outside the current
     receive  window  are  not  processed,  but  are  placed   on   an
     unacknowledged  message  queue.  The advertised receive window is
     determined on the basis of  the  remaining  amount  of  buffering
     allocated  to the connection (see below).  When buffering becomes
     available, data on  the  unacknowledged  message  queue  is  then
     processed and placed on the receive data queue.

          On the output  side,  TCP  requests  for  data  transmission
     result  in  calls  to  the IP level output routine.  This routine
     does fragmentation, if necessary, and makes calls  on  the  local
     network  output  routine.  Outgoing messages are then placed on a
     buffering queue, for transmission to the network interface by the
     device  driver.   In  data  transmission,  an  attempt is made to
     ensure that data moving from the highest level (TCP), will not be
     sent  unless  there is reasonable certainty that the lower levels
     will have the necessary  resources  to  accept  the  message  for
     transmission to the network.

          All data to be sent is maintained on a  single  send  queue,
     where  data  is  added  on  user  writes, and removed when proper
     acknowledgement is received.   Whenever  the  TCP  machine  sends
     data,  a  retransmission timer is set, and the sequence number of
     the first data  byte  on  the  queue  is  saved.   After  initial
     transmission  the  sequence  number  of  the next data to send is
     advanced beyond what was first sent.  If the retransmission timer

     goes off before that data is acknowledged, the sequence number of
     the next data to send is backed up, and the contents of the  send
     buffer  (for the length determined by the current send window) is
     retransmitted, with the ACK and window fields set  appropriately.
     The  retransmission  timer is set with increasingly higher values
     from 3 to 30 seconds, if  the  saved  sequence  number  does  not
     advance.

          A persistence timer is also set when  data  is  sent.   This
     allows  communication  to  be  maintained  if the foreign process
     advertises a zero length window.  When the persistence timer goes
     off, one byte of data is forced out of the TCP.



     4.2  Buffering Strategy

          As mentioned earlier, all data is passed from the network to
     the  various  protocol software layers in intermediate sized (128
     byte) buffers. The  buffers  have  two  chain  pointers,  a  data
     offset,  and a data length field (see Figure 2).  As data is read
     from the network or copied from the user,  multiple  buffers  are
     chained  together.   Protocol  headers  are  also  held  in these
     buffers.  As messages are passed  between  the  various  software
     levels,  the  offset  is  modified  to  point  at the appropriate
     header.  The length field gives the end of data in  a  particular
     buffer.   This offset/length pair facilitates merging of messages
     in IP fragment reassembly and TCP sequencing.

          The allocation of these buffers is handled  by  the  network
     software.   Buffers  are  obtained by "stealing" page frames from
     the kernel's free memory map  (CMAP).   In  VM/UNIX,  these  page
     frames are 1024 bytes long, and thus have room for eight 128 byte
     buffers.  The advantage of using kernel paging memory as a source
     of  network  buffers is that their allocation can be done totally
     dynamically, with little effect on the operation of  the  overall
     system.   Buffers are allocated from a cache of free page frames,
     maintained  on  a  circular  free  list  by  the  network  memory
     allocator.   As the demand for buffers increases, new page frames
     are stolen from the paging freelist  and  added  to  the  network
     buffer  cache.  Similarly,  as  the need for pages decrease, free
     pages are returned to the system.  To minimize  fragmentation  in
     buffer  allocation  within  the  page  frames,  the  free list is
     sorted.  When no more pages are available for allocation, data on
     the IP reassembly and TCP unacknowledged data queues are dropped,
     and their buffers are recycled.

                   Figure 2 . Layout of a Network Buffer


          The number of pages that can be stolen from  the  system  is
     limited  to  a  moderate number (in practice 64-256, depending on
     network utilization in a particular system).  To enforce fairness
     of  network  resource utilization between connections, the number
     of buffers that can be dedicated to a  particular  connection  at
     any  time  is  limited.   This  limit can be varied to some small
     degree by the user when a connection is opened.  Thus,  a  TELNET
     user  may open a connection with the minimum 1K bytes of send and
     receive  buffering;  while  an  FTP  user,  anticipating   larger
     transfers,  might  desire  up  to 4K of buffering.  The effect of
     this connection buffering allocation is to place a limit  on  the
     amount  of data that the TCP may accept from the user for sending
     before blocking, and the amount of input from  the  network  that
     the  TCP  may  acknowledge.   Note that in receiving, the network
     software  may  allocate  available  buffers  beyond  the   user's
     connection  limit  for  incoming  data.   However,  this  data is
     considered volatile, and may be dropped when  buffer  demands  go
     higher.   Incoming  data  is  acknowledged  by TCP only until the
     user's connection buffer limit is exhausted.  The advertised  TCP
     flow  control  window for a connection is set on the basis of the
     remaining amount of this buffering.

          Thus, the network software must insure that  it  has  enough
     buffering  for  1) its own internal use in processing data on the
     IP and local network levels; 2) retaining acknowledged  TCP  data

     that  have  not  been copied to user space; and 3) retaining data
     accepted by the TCP for transmission  which  have  not  yet  been
     acknowledged  by  the  foreign  host  TCP.   Other  data, such as
     unacknowledged TCP input from the network and fragments on the IP
     reassembly  queue are vulnerable to being dropped when demand for
     more buffers makes necessary the recycling of  buffers  on  these
     queues.   Since  there is an absolute limit on the number of page
     frames that may be stolen from the paging system, and  hence  the
     total  number of buffers available, there is a resultant limit on
     the total number of simultaneous connections.

          Several data  structures  are  required  for  stealing  page
     frames  from  the  kernel  and  maintaining the buffer free list.
     These include enough page table entries for mapping  the  maximum
     number  of  page  frames  which can be stolen from the system, an
     allocation map for allocating these page table entries,  and  the
     free  page list itself.  For a 256 page maximum, this requires 2K
     bytes of page tables, 1K bytes for page frame allocation mapping,
     and  another 1K bytes for the network freelist.  The maximum page
     parameter and others, including the minimum and maximum amount of
     buffering  that  the user may specify are modifiable constants of
     the implementation.



     4.3  Data Structures

          Along with the data structures needed to support the  buffer
     management  system,  there are several others used in the network
     software (see Figure 3).  The  focus  of  activity  is  the  user
     connection block (UCB), and the TCP control block (TCB).  The UCB
     is allocated from a table on a per connection  basis.   It  holds
     non-protocol specific information to maintain a connection.  This
     includes a pointer the UNIX process structure of the opener of  a
     connection, (2) a pointer to the foreign host entry for the  peer
     process's  host,  a  pointer  to the protocol-specific connection
     control block (for TCP, the TCB), pointers to the user's send and
     receive  data  buffer  chain,  and miscellaneous flags and status
     information.   When a network connection is opened, an  entry  in
     the user's open file table is allocated, which holds a pointer to
     the UCB.

          For TCP connections, a  TCB  is  allocated.   All  TCBs  are
     chained   together  to  facilitate  buffer  recycling.   The  TCB
     contains a pointer to the corresponding UCB, a block of  sequence
     number  variables  and  state  flags used by the TCP finite state

     control blocks instead of the TCB.  For the "raw"  local  network
     and IP handlers, all necessary information is kept in the UCB.

          Finally, there is a foreign host table,  where  entries  are
     allocated  for each host that is part of a connection.  The entry
     contains the foreign  host's  internet  address,  the  number  of
     outstanding RFNM's for 1822 level host-imp communication, and the
