                   A Host Monitoring Protocol





1  Introduction


     The Host Monitoring   Protocol  (HMP)  is  used  to  collect

information  from hosts  in  various  networks.   At present  the

protocol  aims at collecting information from  ARPANET  IMPs  and

TACs  in  an  internet   environment.    It   is designed  to  be

extensible  to other monitoring functions (e.g.  hosts, gateways,

local  nets)  while  its  addressing and control structures allow

it  to  operate  as  well   within   a   single    network.    In

implementation  it  is  a portion of a larger system, the Network

Operations Center (NOC).


     The   monitoring   algorithm   relies   on    polling    for

messages;  the  Host  Monitor  (HM)  periodically sends a polling

message  to  the host  being  monitored,  requesting a  specified

report.  The host then creates the report and sends it to the HM.

Missing  reports are  detected as unanswered polls and  duplicate

polls  are  sent to have the report retransmitted.  Some messages

cannot be  polled   for   and   these   are   sent   to   the  HM

spontaneously.   Checksums calculated on the data portions of all

messages  assure their integrity.


     The  HMP implements a password scheme in order  to  restrict

access to monitoring information.  The monitored hosts check each


                               -1-


IEN-197                                            September 1981


poll message for a valid password before responding;  this  helps

prevent  unauthorized  use of the monitor system.  The HMP is not

intended to be a highly secure protocol.





2  Protocol Operation


     The   HMP  is  designed   to   operate   reliably   in   the

internet   environment.    To     gain     this     measure    of

reliability it uses  polling.   The  HM  sends  polling  messages

requesting   reports  to  the  monitored  hosts.   A  host,  upon

receiving  the  poll,  verifies  the   message   and,  if  it  is

acceptable, sends the appropriate report to the poll source.  The

HM, after transmitting the poll, awaits the corresponding report.

If  it  is  not  received within a  reasonable interval,  another

poll is sent assuming  that  either  the  previous  poll  or  the

answering  report  was  lost.   If  after  a  number  of repeated

polls  no  response  has  been  received,  it  can  be reasonably

concluded  that the host is unreachable and the polling frequency

is reduced  to  a  background  level.   This   minimizes  traffic

but,  since polling continues, a poll will reach the host once it

becomes reachable.   When a report is received  the  normal  poll

frequency is resumed.



     The most important reason for choosing  polling  over  other

methods of detecting lost messages is that it centralizes control


                               -2-


IEN-197                                            September 1981


of  monitoring  in  a  dedicated  HM,  rather   distributing   it

throughout  the network of monitored hosts.  This frees resources

in the monitored systems and also allows the HM to  regulate  the

flow  of  monitoring  messages to prevent overloading of the HM's

resources.



     There are three classes of data with  which  the  monitoring

protocol  is  concerned.   These  are  (1)  reports of unexpected

changes of status or error conditions, (2) reports of the current

state  of  the host, and (3) reports of statistics and throughput

data.  These three kinds of data are handled in different ways by

the HMP as described below.





2.1  Unsolicited Messages


     These are reports of unexpected changes of status  or  error

condition reports (traps) which the monitor should be informed of

as they occur.   They  are  not  polled,  but  are  instead  sent

directly  to  a  particular HM.  If the address of the HM must be

changed for unsolicited messages, it will  be  done  by  external

means (e.g. packet core protocol).

2.2  Status Messages


     These are reports of the current state  of  a  system;  they

contain  any kind of information which is not cumulative.  The HM

will poll for these on a periodic basis.  When a  monitored  host

receives a poll for a status message, it assembles a message with

the current data pertaining to its  status.   Since  this  is  an

instantaneous  "picture"  of  a system, it is not critical if any

particular status report is lost.




2.3  Statistics Messages


     These messages, also  called  throughput  messages,  contain

data  collected  on  a  periodic  basis.  The information will be

collected in a monitored machine using a double buffering system.

At the end of each collection period, a message will be assembled

and the counters will be cleared.   During  the  next  collection

period,  any  HMs  polling  for a statistics message will be sent

this message.



     The collection frequency  for  statistics  messages  from  a

particular  host  must be relatively long compared to the average

round trip message time between the HM and that host to allow the

HM  to  re-poll  if  it  does  not  receive an answer.  With this

restriction it should be possible to avoid missing any statistics

messages  in  most cases.  Each statistics message will contain a


                               -4-


IEN-197                                            September 1981


field giving the (local) time when the data  was  collected,  and

the time at which the message was sent (*).  This will allow  the

HM  to  schedule  its  polling  so that the poll arrives near the

beginning of each collection period.  This is done to ensure that

if  a  message  is  lost, the HM will have sufficient time to try

again to get the statistics message for  that  period.   Sequence

numbers  will  be  used  to  detect  the  loss of a message for a

period, and also to eliminate duplicate messages.































_______________
* The units of the local time should be large enough to guarantee
a rollover time of at least one hour.

3  Header Formats

     [Note:   Any  field  labeled "unused" is reserved for  later
     extensions and must be zero when sent.]


     Monitor messages have the following format:

                    +----------------+
                    |  Local Network |
                    |    Header(s)   |

                    |  Padding       |
                    +----------------+


     The local header(s) depend on the local network, and do  not
     concern us here.




3.1  IP Headers

     HMP messages are sent using  the  version  4  IP  header  as
     described  in IEN-128 (RFC-760).  The HMP protocol number is
     20 (decimal).  The time to live field should be set  to  the
     maximum  value.  All other fields should be set as specified
     in IEN-128.

HMP FIELDS:

System Type
Message Type

     The combination  of system type and message type  determines
     the format of the data in the monitoring message.

     The system types which have been defined are:


                   System Type  | Meaning
                ----------------+-----------------
                       1        | General Messages
                       2        | IMP
                       3        | TAC

     Message types are defined for each system type according  to
     the  needs  of that system.  Message types and their formats
     for each system are defined below.

Port Number

     The Port Number field is presently unused.  It can  be  used
     to multiplex similar messages from/to different processes in
     one host.

Sequence Number

     Every message contains  a  sequence  number.   The  sequence
     number  is incremented when each new message of that type is
     sent.

IEN-197                                            September 1981


Password or Returned Sequence Number

     The  Password field of a polling message from an HM contains
     a  password  to   verify  that the  HM  is allowed to gather
     information.  Responses  to  polling   messages   copy   the
     Sequence Number from  the  polling message  and return it in
     this  field   for   identification   and   round-trip   time
     calculations.

Checksum

     The  Checksum  field  is  the one's complement of the  one's
     complement  sum of all the 16-bit words in  the  header  and
     data  area.   As  with  the checksum in the TCP header  (see
     IEN-129),  the  checksum  also covers a 96-bit pseudo header
     containing  the source address, the destination address, the
     protocol  (20),  and the length of the monitoring message in
     bytes. The  fields  of the pseudo header are as defined  for
     the IP header.

4  Monitor Message Formats

4.1  System Type 1: General Messages

4.1.1  Message Type 1: Polling Message

Description

     The  HM will send polls to the  machines  it  is  monitoring
     according  to  its polling algorithm.  Multiple requests can
     be combined in a single message, but each request  is  still
     considered a separate poll.

     The  polled  machine  will  return  a  message of each  type
     requested;  it   will  only  answer  a poll with the correct
     system type and password. It will return  an  error  message
     (System  Type  1;  Message Type 2) if it receives a poll for
     the wrong system type or an unsupported message type.

     A polling message has the following form:

              1             0 0             0
              5 4 3 2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
             +---------------+---------------+

4.1.2  Message Type 2: Error in Poll

Description

     This message is sent  in  response  to  a  faulty  poll  and
     specifies the nature of the error.

     An error message has the following form:

              1             0 0             0

4.2  System Type 2: IMP

4.2.1  Message Type 1: IMP Trap

Description

     When a trap occurs, it is buffered in the IMP  and  sent  as
     soon  as possible.  Trap messages are unsolicited.  If traps
     happen in close sequence, several traps may be sent  in  one
     message.

     Through the use of sequence numbers, it will be possible  to
     determine   how  many  traps  are  being  lost.   If  it  is
     discovered that many are lost, a  polling  scheme  might  be
     implemented for traps.

     A IMP trap message has the following form:

                  1             0 0             0
                  5 4 3 2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

IEN-197                                            September 1981


Sequence Number

     A 16 bit number incremented each time a trap message is sent
     so  that  the  HM  can  order the received trap messages and
     detect missed messages.

IMP TRAP FIELDS

# of traps lost

     Under certain conditions, an IMP may overflow  its  internal
     trap  buffers  and  be  unable  to save traps to send.  This
     counter keeps track of such occurrences.

Trap Reports

     There can be several blocks of trap data  in  each  message.
     The format for each such block is below.



                 +---------------+---------------+
                 |             Size              |

                 +---------------+---------------+


  Size

     Size is the number of 16 bit words in the trap, not counting
     the size field.

  Time

     The time (in 640 ms. units)  at  which  the  trap  occurred.
     This  field  is  used to sequence the traps in a message and
     associate groups of traps.

  Trap ID

     This is usually the program counter at  the  trap.   The  ID
     identifies  the  trap,  and  does  not  have to be a program
     counter, provided it uniquely identifies the trap.

  Trap Data

     The IMP returns data giving more information about the trap.
     There are usually two entries: the values in the accumulator
     and the index register at the occurrence of the trap.

4.2.2  Message Type 2: IMP status

Description

     The status message gives a quick summary of the state of the
     IMP.   Status  of the most important features of the IMP are
     reported  as  well  as  the  current  configuration  of  the
     machine.

     The format of the status message is as follows:

                  1             0 0             0

4.2.3  Message Type 3: IMP Modem Throughput

Description

     The modem throughput message reports traffic statistics  for
     each modem in the system. The IMP will collect these data at
     regular intervals and save them awaiting a poll from the HM.
     If  a  period  is  missed  by the HM, the new results simply
     overwrite the old.  Two time stamps bracket  the  collection
     interval  (data-time  and prev-time) and are an indicator of
     missed reports.  In addition, mess-time indicates  the  time
     at which the message was sent.

     The modem throughput message will accommodate up to fourteen
     modems  in  one  packet.   A provision is made to split this
     into multiple packets by including a modem  number  for  the
     first  entry  in  the packet.  This field is not immediately
     useful, but if machine sizes grow beyond fourteen modems  or
     if  modem  statistics become more detailed and use more than
     three words per modem, this can be used to keep the  message
     within a single ARPANET packet.

     The format of the modem throughput message is as follows:

                  1             0 0             0
                  5 4 3 2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

This Modem

     This Modem is the number of the first modem reported in this
     message.   Large  systems  that  are unable to fit all their
     modem reports into a single packet may  use  this  field  to
     separate their message into smaller chunks to take advantage
     of single packet message efficiencies.

Modem Throughput

     Modem  throughput  consists   of   three   words   of   data
     reporting  packets  and  words  output  on  each modem.  The
     first  word  counts packets  output and  the  following  two
     count  word  throughput.   The  double  precision  words are
     arranged high order first.  (Note  also that  messages  from
     Honeywell  type machines (316s, 516s and C30s) use a fifteen
     bit low order word.)  The first block reports output on  the
     modem  specified  by  "This  Modem".   The  following blocks
     report on consecutive modems.

4.2.4  Message Type 4: IMP Host Throughput

Description

     The host throughput message reports traffic  statistics  for
     each host in the system.  The IMP will collect these data at
     regular intervals and save them awaiting a poll from the HM.
     If  a  period  is  missed  by the HM, the new results simply
     overwrite the old.  Two time stamps bracket  the  collection
     interval  (data-time  and prev-time) and are an indicator of
     missed reports.  In addition, mess-time indicates  the  time
     at which the message was sent.

     The host throughput format will hold  only  three  hosts  if
     packet  boundaries are to be respected.  A provision is made
     to split this into multiple  packets  by  including  a  host
     number for the first entry in the packet.

     The format of the host throughput message is as follows:

                  1             0 0             0
                  5 4 3 2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

     Each host throughput message will contain several blocks  of
     data.   The  first  block  will  contain  data  for the host
     specified in  First  Host  Number.   Following  blocks  will
     contain data for consecutive hosts.  All counters are single
     precision with the exception of the two word counters  which
     are  double  precision.   The  double  precision  words  are
     arranged high order first.  Note  also  that  messages  from
     Honeywell  type machines (316s, 516s and C30s) use a fifteen
     bit low order word.

4.3  System Type 3: TAC

4.3.1  Message Type 1: TAC Trap Message

Description

     When a trap occurs, it is buffered in the TAC  and  sent  as
     soon  as possible.  Trap messages are unsolicited.  If traps
     happen in close sequence, several traps may be sent  in  one
     message.

     Through the use of sequence numbers, it will be possible  to
     determine   how  many  traps  are  being  lost.   If  it  is
     discovered that many are lost, a  polling  scheme  might  be
     implemented for traps.

     A TAC trap message has the following form:

                  1             0 0             0
                  5 4 3 2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

Sequence Number

     A 16 bit number incremented each time a trap message is sent
     so  that  the  HM  can  order the received trap messages and
     detect missed messages.

TAC TRAP FIELDS

# of traps lost

     Under certain conditions, a TAC may  overflow  its  internal
     trap  buffers  and  be  unable  to save traps to send.  This
     counter keeps track of such occurrences.

Trap Reports

     There can be several blocks of trap data in each message.

     The format of the trap data is as follows:


                 +---------------+---------------+
                 |             Size              |
                 +---------------+---------------+

                 +---------------+---------------+
                 |            Trap ID            |
                 +---------------+---------------+
                 :             Trap              :
                 :             Data              :
                 +---------------+---------------+


  Size

     Size is the number of 16 bit words in the trap, not counting
     the size field.

  Time

     The time (in 640ms. units) at which the trap occurred.  This
     field  is  used  to  sequence  the  traps  in  a message and
     associate groups of traps.

  Trap ID

     This is (usually) the program counter at the trap.   The  ID
     identifies  the  trap,  and  does  not  have to be a program
     counter, provided that it uniquely identifies the trap.

  Trap Data

     The TAC returns data giving more information about the trap.
     There are usually two entries: the values in the accumulator
     and the index register at the occurrence of the trap.

Description

     The status message gives a quick summary of the state of the
     TAC.   Status  of the most important features of the TAC are
     reported  as  well  as  the  current  configuration  of  the
     machine.


     A TAC status message has the following form:

4.3.3  Message Type 3: TAC Throughput

Description

     The  TAC  throughput  message  reports  statistics  for  the
     various modules of the TAC.  The TAC will collect these data
     at regular intervals and save them awaiting a poll from  the
     HM.  If a period is missed by the HM, the new results simply
     overwrite the old.  Two time stamps bracket  the  collection
     interval  (data-time  and prev-time) and are an indicator of
     missed reports.  In addition, mess-time indicates  the  time
     at which the message was sent.


     A TAC throughput message has the following form:

               1             0 0             0
               5 4 3 2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
