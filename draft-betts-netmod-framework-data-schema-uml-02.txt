Framework for Deriving Interface Data Schema from UML Information Models
            draft-betts-netmod-framework-data-schema-uml-02

Abstract

   This draft describes a framework for how purpose and protocol
   specific interfaces can be systematically derived from an underlying
   common information model, focusing upon the networking and forwarding
   domain.  The benefit of using such an approach in interface
   specification development is to promote convergence,
   interoperability, and efficiency.

Internet-Draft         Data Schema from UML Model         September 2015


1.  Introduction

   Interface specifications are often generated as point solutions where
   the designer codes a particular interface from domain (problem space)
   concepts that may not be explicitly captured, may be defined using
   localized terminology that is subject to ambiguity in interpretation,
   and is highly focused on a particular use-case/application.  The
   designer typically provides a representation of the interface schema
   in the form of a data schema [RFC3444](i.e., data structures conveyed
   over the interface), which only exposes the view of the domain
   relevant at that specific interface.  As this data schema is a simple
   statement of the particular interface, it solely describes
   relationships relevant to the specific realization, having no
   inherent relationship to other interfaces in the system.

   Approaching the development of interface specifications on a per use-
   case/application basis tends to promote unnecessary variety through a
   proliferation of similar interfaces, resulting in unnecessary
   divergences that limit interoperability.  It also risks confusion of
   representational artifacts with fundamental characteristics of the
   information to be conveyed across the interface.  There is also a
   risk that conflicting representations of the same information may be
   generated.  Finally, as each such interface appears to stand alone,
   it thereby fails to capture relationships with other aspects of the
   same (or different) domains that are not explicitly needed for the
   interface.

   This draft describes a framework for how a protocol specific data
   schema and the encoding used for the interface can be systematically
   derived from an underlying common information model, focusing upon
   the networking and forwarding domain.  The benefit of using such an
   approach in the development of interface specifications is to promote
   convergence, interoperability, and efficiency.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Basic Concepts

   An information model condenses domain knowledge and insights to
   provide a representation of its essential concepts, structures, and
   inter-relationships.  In capturing domain understanding, such a model
   offers a coherent and consistent terminology and structure, expresses
   the semantics of the domain, and interrelates all relevant aspects of
   the domain.  It enables a consistent expression of information that

   improves interoperability between software components at interfaces
   derived from it.  A "good" information model should capture domain
   best practices, and be designed to support domain variety as well as
   extensibility and evolution.  Examples of domains include networking
   and forwarding, storage, etc.  A common industry information model is
   the assembly of all domain information models, which inter-relate at
   "touch points".  Note that a common industry information model should
   not be interpreted as being a monolithic entity; in particular, a
   modular structure is essential to allow for extensibility.

   There may be several relevant views of any particular domain,
   depending upon the perspective of the viewer, all of which are
   interrelated and involve subsets of the information model, and none
   of which contradict each other.  (It should be noted that one view
   provides the information model representation of the overall domain.)
   To form a particular (purpose-specific) view, some elements of the
   model may be pruned.  Additionally, for efficiency, some systematic
   refactoring of the information model may also occur.

   In this draft, the term data schema is used in the context of either:
   (i) a specific protocol that is used to implement a purpose specific
   interface, or (ii) a programming language that is used to invoke a
   purpose specific API.  Note that it is possible to map directly from
   the purpose specific information model to interface encoding.

   While a purpose specific interface/API is not a simple direct
   encoding of the information model of the overall domain, it is by its
   nature based on a relevant view of the information model of the
   domain (i.e., a purpose specific information model view).  It must be
   completely and consistently traceable to this view and should use the
   associated domain terminology.  Depending on its application, a
   particular view may lead to a number of encoded forms at various
   types of interfaces/APIs.  The information model does not dictate the
   encoded form, which will depend upon such factors as necessary
   capability, interaction style, and programming language.

3.  Information Modeling

   This section introduces the Unified Modeling Language (UML), which
   has been used to model application structure, behavior, and
   architecture (in addition to business process and data structure).
   It also provides references to existing and ongoing work on standard
   information models based on UML.

3.1.  Unified Modeling Language

   The information model is expressed in terms of the Unified Modeling
   Language (UML) [OMG_UML], which was developed by the Object
   Management Group.  It is a general-purpose modeling language in the
   field of software engineering.  In 2000 the Unified Modeling Language
   was also accepted by the International Organization for
   Standardization (ISO) as an approved ISO standard [ISO_IEC_UML].  UML
   may be used in four ways:

   o  To define a set of objects (instantiated classes that, if
      organized, describe a data model)

   o  As an information model

   o  As a metamodel (used to create an information model)

   o  As a meta-metamodel

   UML defines a number of basic model elements (UML artifacts), such as
   object classes, attributes, associations, interfaces, operations,
   operation parameters, data types, etc.  In order to assure a
   consistent and harmonized modelling approach, and to ensure
   uniformity in the application of UML to a problem domain, a subset of
   the basic model artifacts should be selected according to guidelines
   for creating an information model expressed in UML [ONF_TR-514].  The
   guidelines are generic; i.e., they are not specific to any particular
   domain that the information model is addressing, nor are they
   restricted to any particular protocol interface data schema.  A UML
   information model may be created using Open Source UML tools;
   guidelines to be taken into account during the creation of a UML
   information model for the Open Source tool Papyrus have been
   developed in [ONF_TR-515].

3.2.  Standard UML Information Model

   Information models expressed in UML, primarily focused upon the
   networking and forwarding domain, have been, and are in the process
   of being, developed in ITU-T, TM Forum, NGMN, 3GPP, MEF, ONF, and
   others.

   ITU-T Recommendations are focused on understanding the
   telecommunications problem space and developing information models
   addressing network and network element considerations.  Some examples
   of available standard ITU-T information models relevant to the
   networking and forwarding domain include:

Internet-Draft         Data Schema from UML Model         September 2015


   o  ITU-T G.874.1 (2012), Optical transport network: Protocol-neutral
      management information model for the network element view
      [ITU-T_G.874.1]

   o  ITU-T G.8052/Y.1346 (2013), Protocol-neutral management
      information model for the Ethernet Transport capable network
      element [ITU-T_G.8052]

   o  ITU-T G.8152/Y.1375, Protocol-neutral management information model
      for the MPLS-TP network element [ITU-T_G.8152]

   o  ITU-T G.7711, Generic protocol-neutral management Information
      Model for transport resources [ITU-T_G.7711]

   The above information models are developed from ITU-T Recommendations
   that define the respective transport technology functional models and
   management requirements.

   The TM Forum community has likewise developed extensive models of the
   same space from the network level management perspective [TMF_MTNM]
   [TMF_MTOSI] [TMF_TR225].  The basis for all functions made available
   to the network level management is defined in the protocol-neutral
   network element level management work done in ITU-T.  Its models thus
   complement the ITU-T information models.  In further collaboration
   with 3GPP, considerable joint effort has been devoted to develop a
   consistent and coherent approach to that space.

   The NGMN has published a document called Next Generation Converged
   Operations Requirements (NGCOR) [NGMN_NGCOR], with the expressed
   purpose of taking these requirements into account when converged
   management interfaces for mobile and fixed networks are being
   standardized in the SDOs.  An ongoing collaboration called the Multi-
   SDO Project on Converged Management is taking care that the
   requirements are considered during the specification of new
   interfaces.  It includes participants from ETSI, NGMN, TMF, 3GPP, and
   other SDOs, equipment vendors, OS vendors and service providers.

4.  From UML IM to Data Schema Definition

   This section outlines the overall structure of a modular and
   evolvable common information model and how purpose specific IM views
   and data schema may be derived from it [ONF_TR-513].

4.1.  Methodology Overview

   As illustrated in Figure 1 below, the common information model is
   comprised of a library of model artifacts (objects, attributes, and
   associations) organized into a number of information model fragments

   (sub-modules), to facilitate the independent development of
   technology and application specific extensions.  The Core Model
   fragment refers to information model artifacts that are intended for
   use by multiple applications and/or forwarding technologies.  For
   purposes of navigability, the Core Model fragment is further sub-
   structured into modules (further discussed in Section 4.1).  The
   forwarding technology specific model fragment refers to technology
   specific extensions; e.g., for OTN, Ethernet, SDH, etc.  The
   application specific fragment refers to extensions for supporting
   particular applications.

     High-level common information model structure and methodology for
   deriving interface protocol specific data schema/interface encodings

                                 Figure 1

   The following subsections provide further elaboration of the high-
   level methodology introduced above.

4.2.  Common Information Model

   As introduced earlier, a common information model includes the
   objects/packages, their properties (represented as attributes), and
   their relationships, etc. that are necessary to describe the domain
   for the applications being developed.  It will be necessary to
   continually expand and refine the common model over time as new
   forwarding technologies, capabilities and applications are
   encompassed and new insights are gained.  To allow these extensions
   to be made in a seamless manner, the common information model is
   structured into a number of model fragments.  This modelling approach
   enables application specific and forwarding plane technology specific
   extensions to be developed independently.

   Note that upon recognizing that some part(s) of the common
   information model needs to be augmented or changed, these should be
   clearly identified using model lifecycle stereotypes (e.g.,
   experimental, preliminary, obsolete) to ensure ongoing compatibility
   and to ease migration.  The use of these stereotypes is described in
   the UML modeling guidelines [ONF_TR-514].

4.2.1.  Core Model fragment

   The core model fragment is itself further sub-structured into
   modules, each addressing a specific topic to allow for easier
   navigation.  Currently, these consist of a core network module and a
   core foundation module [I-D.lam-topology].

   o  The core network module consists of artifacts that model the
      essential network aspects that are neutral to the forwarding



Betts, et al.             Expires March 8, 2016                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft         Data Schema from UML Model         September 2015


      technology of the network.  This module currently encompasses
      Topology, Termination, and Forwarding subsets of the core network
      module.

   o  The core foundation module defines the artifacts for referencing
      entities, so that communications about an entity can take place.

4.2.2.  Forwarding plane technology specific or application specific
        model Fragments

   These fragments contain the artifacts (objects, attributes and
   associations) that relate solely the specific technology or
   application.  In some cases an application or forwarding technology
   addition will also require enhancement of the core model fragment.

4.3.  Common Information Model View for a Specific Purpose

   The next step is the development of a purpose specific information
   model view, which is a true subset of the common information model.
   To provide maximal reuse, the purpose specific view is developed in
   two steps: (1) pruning and refactoring to provide a purpose specific
   information model of the network to be managed, where only those
   artefacts that represent the capabilities that are both in scope and
   supported are included, and (2)defining the access rights for the
   various groups of users that will manage that network.  Pruning and
   refactoring provides a purpose specific information model that
   represents the capabilities of the network of interest.  The
   definition of access rights provides the ability to limit the actions
   that can be taken by the various user groups that will use that
   information model.

   o  Pruning to remove the objects/packages/attributes that are not
      required.

      - Selecting the required object classes from the common IM (all
        mandatory attributes and packages must be included)

      - Selecting the required conditional packages and optional
        attributes (note that, where appropriate, conditional packages
        and optional attributes may be declared mandatory in the purpose
        specific IM)

      - Removing any optional associations that are not required

   o  Refactoring to reduce association flexibility, such as:

      - Reducing multiplicity (e.g., from [1..*] to [1]).  When this
        results in a composition association of multiplicity [1] between

        a subordinate and superior object class, they can be combined
        into a single object class by moving the attributes of the
        superior class into the subordinate class.

      - Where possible, reducing the depth of the inheritance (i.e.,
        combining object classes by moving the attributes of the super
        class into the subclass).

      - Adding reverse navigation, if useful for the client.  The common
        IM only supports navigation from a subordinate object class to a
        superior object class.  This allows new subordinate object
        classes to be added without any impact on the superior object
        class.  In a network specific implementation it is frequently
        useful to be able to navigate the relationship between superior
        and subordinate object classes in both directions.

      - Constraining attribute definitions.  This can be done by
        reducing legal value ranges, defining which (if any) attributes
        should be read only (for all users), and/or defining constraints
        between attributes.

   o  Definition of access rights

        If only one group will use the network specific IM then this
        step is not required.  If more than one group will use the
        network specific IM this optional step provides a profile for
        each user group to:

      - Convert some attributes defined as read/write in the network
        specific IM to read only

      - Remove the right to create/delete some or all object instances

4.4.  Data Schema

   A data schema (DS) is constructed by mapping of the purpose specific
   information model view into the DS together with the operations
   patterns from the common information model to provide the interface
   protocol specific operations and notifications.  The operations
   should include data structures taken directly from the purpose
   specific information model view with no further adjustment.  (Note
   that it is possible to map directly from the purpose specific
   information model to interface encoding).

   The development of the data schema should consider the following:

   o  The operations should act on the information in a way consistent
      with the modeled object lifecycle interdependency rules.

      - Instance lifecycle dependencies to ensure sensible interface
        operation structuring and interface flow rules

      - Usage of transaction approach style of interface to account for
        lifecycle dependencies of the model

   o  The operations should abide the attribute properties.  Read only
      attributes (except those which are defined as setByCreate) should
      not be included in data related to creation of an object (e.g.,
      not in createData) or in a specification of a desired object
      structure outcome.

   o  Usage of attribute value ranges, etc. to allow "effort" statement,
      optionality and negotiation to be supported by the interface.

4.5.  Interface encoding

   This step encodes the purpose specific data schema or purpose
   specific information model into either a specific protocol that is
   used to implement a purpose specific interface or; a programming
   language that is used to invoke a purpose specific API.  If the
   interface is encoded directly from the purpose specific information
   model then the interface operations must be added as described above.

5.  Translation from UML

   Applying the methodology outlined in Section 4, protocol-specific
   interface data schema/encodings may be derived from existing, and
   emerging, standard UML information models addressing the forwarding
   and networking domains (e.g., [ITU-T_G.7711], refactored G.874.1
   [ITU-T_G.874.1]).

   In order to assure a consistent and valid data modelling language
   representation that enables maximum interoperability, translation
   guidelines from UML information models to data schema/interface
   encodings are required.  A set of translation rules also assists in
   development of automated tooling.

   Guidelines are currently under development for translation of data
   modeled with UML to YANG including mapping of object classes,
   attributes, data types, associations, interfaces, operations and
   operation parameters, notifications, and lifecycle
   [I-D.mansfield-uml].

   It should be noted that the concept of deriving protocol-specific
   modules from UML information models is not new (e.g., MEF 38 [MEF_38]
   and MEF 39 [MEF_39] provide YANG modules derived from UML information
   models G.8052 [ITU-T_G.8052] and MEF 7.1 [MEF_7.1] for Service OAM

   Fault and Performance Monitoring, respectively.).  What is new is the
   concept of an open, modular, evolvable common information model,
   coupled with an associated suite of essential guidelines (e.g., UML,
   Open Source tooling, translation, etc.), for realizing a coherent set
   of solution modules.

6.  Summary

   This draft describes a modular and scalable approach for
   systematically deriving purpose and protocol specific interfaces from
   an underlying common information model, focusing upon the networking
   and forwarding domain.  Building upon an underlying common
   information modeling description of network resources (functionality,
   capabilities, flexibility) is a key enabler to convergence and
   interoperability.  It is also future proof in the sense that the
   emergence of new protocols becomes solely a non-disruptive mapping
   issue.  It should be noted that not all domains require development
   of information model prior to solutions development; the domains
   where this is of greatest benefit involve networking domains
   requiring support for an enhanced level of control and network
   programmability.
