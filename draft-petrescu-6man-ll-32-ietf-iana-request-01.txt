1.  Definitions and Statements

2.  Terminology

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Security Considerations

   There can be security risks in the use of link-local addressed
   packets if they are not protected by tecnologies like IPsec.  The
   risks are valid to all kinds of link-local addresses, be them
   fe80::/10 or fe80::/64.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign fe80:1::/32 for use in vehicular
   networks.
