1. Introduction

  In "A syntax for describing media feature sets" [1], an expression
  format is presented for describing media feature capabilities as a
  combination of simple media feature tags, registered according to
  "Media Feature Tag Registration Procedure" [2].  This provides a
  format for message handling agents to describe the media feature
  content of messages that they can handle.

  This memo defines a MIME 'Content-features:' header that can be
  used to annotate a MIME message part using these feature
  expressions.  This header provides a means to indicate media-
  related features of message content that go beyond the MIME content
  type.

  Along with the new MIME header definition, consideration is also
  given to how it may be used to present message media content
  information that is problematic to express within the basic MIME
  framework.

1.1 Terminology and document conventions

  This section defines a number of terms and other document
  conventions, which are used with specific meaning in this memo.

  media feature
            information that indicates facilities assumed to be
            available for the message content to be properly rendered
            or otherwise presented.  Media features are not intended
            to include information that affects message transmission.

  feature set
            some set of media features described by a media feature
            assertion, as described in "A syntax for describing media
            feature sets" [1].  (See that memo for a more formal
            definition of this term.)

  feature set expression
            a string that describes some feature set, formulated
            according to the rules in "A syntax for describing media
            feature sets" [1] (and possibly extended by other
            specifications).

  This specification uses syntax notation and conventions described
  in RFC 2234 "Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF" [3].

       NOTE:  Comments like this provide additional nonessential
       information about the rationale behind this document.
       Such information is not needed for building a conformant
       implementation, but may help those who wish to understand
       the design in greater depth.

Internet draft              Indicating media features for MIME content
13 April  1999


2. Motivation and goals

  It is envisaged that media feature labelling of message parts may
  be used in the following ways:

  o  to supply more detailed media feature information about a message
     content than can be provided by the 'Content-type:' header.

  o  to provide summary media feature information (possibly including
     MIME content types) about the content of a composite MIME message
     part (e.g. 'multipart' or 'message'), without having to open up
     the inner content of the message.

  o  to supply media feature information about external data
     referenced by a message part (e.g. 'message/external-body' MIME
     type).  This information would not be available by examination of
     the message content.

  o  to describe the content of a message that is encrypted or encoded
     using some application-specific file structure that hides the
     content from a MIME processor.  This information also would not
     be generally available by examination of the message content.

3. The 'Content-features:' MIME header

  A new header field is defined that extends the allowable formats
  for 'optional-field' [4] with the following syntax:

     optional-field =/ "Content-features" ":" Feature-expr
     Feature-expr   =  filter      ; See [1], section 4.1

  where 'filter' is the media feature expression format defined by "A
  syntax for describing media feature sets" [1].

  This header provides additional information about the message
  content directly contained or indirectly referenced in the
  corresponding MIME message part.

3.1 Usage considerations

3.1.1 Simple message parts

  When applied to a simple MIME message part, the header should
  appear just once and is used to convey additional information about
  the message part content that goes beyond that provided by the MIME
  'Content-type:' header field.  The 'Content-features:' header may
  indicate a content type that is different than that given by the
  MIME 'Content-type:' header.  This is possible but not recommended:
  In such cases, MIME content type processing must be performed in
  accordance with the MIME 'Content-type:' header.


Klyne                      Work-in-progress                   [Page 4]

Internet draft              Indicating media features for MIME content
13 April  1999


       NOTE:  Once the message content has been delivered to an
       application, it is possible that subsequent processing
       may be affected by content type information indicated by
       the media feature expression.

3.1.2 Multipart and other composites

  'Content-features:' headers may be applied to a MIME multipart
  indicating information about the inner content of the multipart.
  No one-to-one relationship between headers and contained body parts
  is assumed.

  If it is important to relate specific media features to specific
  MIME body parts, then the 'Content-features:' header should be
  applied directly to the body part concerned, rather than the
  surrounding composite.

       NOTE:  The intent here is to allow summary media feature
       information to be provided without having to open up and
       examine the inner content of the MIME message.

  Similar usage may apply when the message format is a non-MIME or
  opaque composite;  e.g. 'application/zip', or an encrypted message.
  In these cases, the option of examining the message content to
  discover media feature information is not available.

3.1.3 Reference to external data

  Media feature information about data indirectly referenced by a
  MIME body part rather than contained within message can be conveyed
  using one or more 'Content-features:' headers.

  For example, media information --including contained MIME content
  type(s)-- about the data referenced by a MIME 'Message/external-
  body' may be conveyed.

4. Examples

     Content-features: (type="text/html")
     Content-features: (type="image/gif")

     --boundary-example
     Content-Type: text/html;charset="US-ASCII"
     Content-ID: <foo3@foo1@bar.net>

      ALT="IETF logo">

     --boundary-example
     Content-Location:

5. Security considerations

  When applied to simple or multipart MIME formatted data, a media
  feature expression provides summary information about the message
  data, which in many cases can be determined by examination of the
  message content.  Under these circumstances, no additional security
  considerations appear to be raised.

  When applied to other message composites, especially encrypted
  message content, feature expressions may disclose information that
  is otherwise unavailable.  In these cases, some security
  considerations associated with media content negotiation [1,2] may
  have greater relevance.

  It is suggested here that media feature descriptions may be
  usefully employed with encrypted message content.  In doing this,
  take care to ensure that the purpose of encryption is not
  compromised.
