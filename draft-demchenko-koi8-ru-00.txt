   used in Ukrainian Internet community character set for mail and news

Internet Draft    Ukrainian Cyrillic Charset KOI8-RU     October 1997


   (including Ukraine and worldwide Ukrainian speaking community) 
   supporting it. 

   "KOI8-RU" (KOI8 Russian and Ukrainian) summarises and completes 
   de-facto standard koi8-u accepted by all Ukrainian community in the 
   Internet and unofficially published at many sites 
   (F.E., ftp://ftp.ua.net/pub/info/encodings/koi8-u/ukr_chars_in_koi8-
   u_and_others.txt; ftp://ftp.gu.kiev.ua/pub/koi8-u/ukr_chars_in_koi8-
   u_and_others.txt; http://cad.ntu-kpi.kiev.ua/multiling/KOI8-U.html). 

   Ukrainian language is the 20th among the world's languages (http:// 
   www.isoc.org:8080/langues/iso639.htm) and supported not only in 
   Ukraine as national state but among Ukrainian communities over the 
   world.

   KOI8-RU should be registered to support and facilitate general and 
   cultural information content development and dissemination. Support 
   of Ukrainian language in new software product is restrained by absent 
   of officially registered and widely published de-facto used Ukrainian 
   charset.

   One of the problem now is that all old codepages ISO-IR-111, ISO 
   8859-5 doesn't include new Ukr. letter GHE (with upturn). Now it's 
   registered in UNICODE 2.0.14 as Cyrillic GHE with upturn (0490 - 
   capital, 0491 - small). It is used in more than 25 ukrainian words 
   and carry in some cases specific national features. 


Compatibility with other character sets

   This standard is unpublished but based on several published 
   standards: first of all, RFC1489 (it is fully complaint in all 
   russian letters), ISO 8859-5, ISO-IR-111, UNICODE 2.0.14.

   KOI8-RU is compatible with KOI8-R in all Cyrillic Letters and 
   completes it with four Ukrainian (#164, #180 - ukr. ie, #166, #182 - 
   ukr. i, #167, #183 - ukr. yi, #173, #189 - ukr. ghe with upturn) and 
   one Byelorussian (#174, #190 - byelorussian short u) letters which 
   locations are complaint with ISO-IR-111.

   All FORMS except positions occupied by Ukrainian and Byelorussian 
   letters and Bullets in positions #148, #149, #158 coincide with 
   KOI8-R.

   Positions #147, #150-153, #155-#157, #159 are used for important 
   characters which are currently missing from ISO-IR-111.

APPENDIX A

DIFFERENCE OF KOI8-RU from EXISTING KOI8-R and ISO-IR-111 

   KOI8-RU is compatible with KOI8-R in all Cyrillic Letters and 
   completes it with Ukrainian letters UKRAINIAN IE #164, #180,
