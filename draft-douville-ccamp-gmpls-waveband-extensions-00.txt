1. Abstract

   Generalized-MPLS (GMPLS) extends the MPLS control plane to encompass
   time-division, wavelength and spatial switching. A functional
   description of the extensions to MPLS signaling needed to support
   the new types of switching is provided in [GMPLS-SIG]. Along with
   the current development of IP over optical switching, there are
   considerable developments in optical transport systems based on the
   multiple optical switching granularities. [GMPLS-SIG] currently
   defines two layers of optical granularity (wavelength and fiber). As
   described in [IPO-MG], a revisited definition of waveband switching
   must be introduced. This document presents a functional description
   of the extensions, to the GMPLS protocol suite, to integrate the
   additional requirements of optical multi-granularity and to further
   benefit from the features of those switching layers.

5. Introduction

   In optical networks, the multi-granularity concept described in
   [IPO-MG] provides the ability to simultaneously switch different
   levels of granularity inside a given optical network. The
   granularities we considered inside optical networks are single

   wavelengths (L-LSP), bundles of wavelengths that we call wavebands
   (WB-LSP), and whole fibers (F-LSP).

   Optical multi-granularity relies on technologies working at the
   different switching levels (e.g. wavelength, band and fiber). One of
   the key benefits in optical backbone networks is to simplify the
   switching procedures of numerous lower granularity LSPs (Lambda-
   LSPs, for instance) by switching these LSPs as a single entity or
   LSP of higher granularity order (e.g. WB-LSP or F-LSP). To enable
   such grouping of LSPs, grooming strategies can be employed.

   We propose to extend GMPLS previous set of switching capabilities in
   the optical domain, by identifying uncovered characteristics of the
   optical transport, taking into account interest for optical
   components working at the band level and its impact on the control
   of the optical networks. In the efforts of describing the
   requirements and set of capabilities for optical multi-granularity,
   three approaches to waveband switching have been identified:
   - Inverse Multiplexing
   - Wavelength Concatenation
   - Waveband

   The common availability of optical/photonic switching equipment
   capable to work at the band level motivates the redefinition of
   waveband switching as defined in the GMPLS architecture. Current
   definition of waveband switching (see [GMPLS-ARCH] and [GMPLS-SIG])
   refers to inverse multiplexing mechanism or wavelength concatenation
   (ôcontiguousö lambdas in a trunk defining a logical waveband). While
   this definition is still valid and applicable, it does not consider
   the approach where band has a physical significance, i.e. where the
   interface is WaveBand Switch Capable (WBSC). Physical waveband has
   the ability to switch directly a portion of the frequency spectrum
   without the need to distinguish between the inner components (e.g.
   wavelengths).

   The following document regroups the extensions to the GMPLS protocol
   suite required to support the introduction of the optical multi-
   granularity and particularly the new definition and features of
   waveband switching.

6. Integration in the GMPLS Protocol Suite Extensions

6.1. Hierarchy Overview

   The integration of optical multi-granularity in the GMPLS
   architecture requires modifications and extensions to current
   definitions. For this purpose, we first introduces  a new type of
   switching capable interface: the Waveband Switching Capable
   Interface (WBSC). The WBSC interface materializes the physical
   reality of optical waveband as an atomic entity or granularity. As
   with the introduction of the waveband switch capable interface, a
   new class of LSP is defined: the WaveBand LSP (WB-LSP).

        L2-LSP    <--->   L2SC   <---->     Bridge,Switch

   (1) WB-LSPs can be supported on both Lambda and WaveBand Switch
   Capable interfaces depending on the nature of the waveband being
   requested (inverse multiplexing, wavelength concatenation, physical
   waveband).

   Note that WXC, BXC and FXC can be part of the same entity referred
   to as MG-OXC or MG-PXC.

   The above figure illustrates the hierarchy of the switching layers
   and highlights the optical multi-granularity part. The network
   element column shows typical equipment that supports such
   interfaces. Note that this representation does not aim at
   restricting interfaces that network elements can support.

   The [GMPLS-ARCH] document considers waveband switching a particular
   case of lambda switching. As specified, a waveband represents a set
   of contiguous wavelengths, which can be switched together to a new
   waveband. However, definition does not introduce a new LSP Encoding
   Type.

   The current definition of the waveband is too restrictive at least
   on two key aspects. The first one is that current definition of
   waveband implies a wavelength composition of the waveband, due to
   waveband switching by wavelength cross-connects (WXC). This
   definition provides support to inverse multiplexing mechanism and
   wavelength concatenation. This approach limits the use of waveband
   to the wavelength switch capable technologies. With waveband
   switching technologies, the WBSC interface doesn't distinguish
   between the component lambdas, channels or packets on the waveband
   which is switch as a single unit (wide frequency spectrum) like it
   could be done with the fibers (the penultimate frequency spectrum)
   on photonic cross-connect (PXC). The second restrictive point is
   that the current definition of the waveband does not enable
   intermediate grooming strategy as described in [IPO-MG].

   For this purpose, we introduce an additional optical granularity
   representing the waveband. This definition is more general and

R.Douville et al. - Internet Draft û Expiration May 2002             4

draft-douville-ccamp-gmpls-waveband-extension-00.txt     November 2001


   always allows to request a set of contiguous wavelengths (i.e.
   inverse multiplexing mechanism and wavelength concatenation) but
   also address the "real" waveband switching and following the set of
   capabilities introduced in the document [IPO-MG]. This definition
   better fits into the GMPLS architecture.

   It would be noted that "Waveband/Set of wavelength", as it is today
   defined, form a contiguous optical granularity concatenation/set
   i.e. nesting of wavelengths in waveband. This general scheme which
   request contiguous optical granularity concatenation/set could be
   applied with other optical granularities.

6.2. General Label Request [GMPLS-SIG]

   The Generalized Label Request must support the Waveband LSP request.
   For this purpose, we propose to extend field values of the LSP
   Encoding for the Generalized Label Request by an adjunction of a new
   LSP Encoding Type, a specific Switching Type and also some
   enhancement of the already defined Generalized PID (G-PID) values.

      The information carried in a Generalized Label Request is:

     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    | LSP Enc. Type |Switching Type |             G-PID             |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

          LSP Encoding Type: 8 bits

   Indicates the encoding of the LSP being requested. The following
   value 11 is added to the existing LSP Encoding Type values to
   provide Waveband LSP support:

             Value       Type
             -----       ----
               1         Packet
               2         Ethernet V2/DIX
               3         ANSI PDH
               4         ETSI PDH
               5         SDH ITU-T G.707
               6         SONET ANSI T1.105
               7         Digital Wrapper, G.709
               8         Lambda (photonic)
               9         Fiber
              10         Ethernet 802.3
              11         WaveBand (Photonic)

   Therefore, we have the following LSP encoding:
   - The Lambda encoding type refers to an LSP that encompasses a whole
     wavelength.
   - The Waveband encoding type refers to an LSP that encompasses a
     whole waveband.

draft-douville-ccamp-gmpls-waveband-extension-00.txt     November 2001


   - The Fiber encoding type refers to an LSP that encompasses a whole
     fiber port.

   For example, consider an LSP signaled with "WaveBand" encoding. It
   is expected that such an LSP would be supported with no electrical
   conversion and no knowledge of the frequency cutting, modulation and
   speed by the transit nodes.  Other formats normally require framing
   knowledge, and field parameters are broken into the framing type and
   speed.

          Switching Type: 8 bits

   Indicates the type of switching that should be performed on a
   particular link. This field is needed for links that advertise more
   than one type of switching capability. For OXC or PXC enabling
   Waveband switching, the WBSC value is used to refer to such
   switching capability. Other values of this field are as the
   Switching Capability field defined in [GMPLS-ROUTING]

          Generalized PID (G-PID): 16 bits

          An identifier of the payload carried by an LSP, i.e. an
   identifier of the client layer of that LSP.  This is used by the
   nodes at the endpoints of the LSP, and in some cases by the
   penultimate hop.  Standard Ethertype values are used for packet and
   Ethernet LSPs; other values are defined in [GMPLS-SIG].

   As described in [IPO-MG] since a waveband can carry a Lambda LSP
   while a Waveband LSP can be transported on a Fiber LSP, the
   following additional G-PID values must be considered: see [GMPLS-
   SIG] section 3.1.1 û Required Information, paragraph on Generalized-
   PID

         37     Lambda                        Waveband, Fiber
         ...
         40     Waveband                      Fiber

   In addition the following existing values must be updated in order
   to reflect the transport of Ethernet and SDH/SONET payload over a
   waveband LSP:

         33     Ethernet                      SDH, Lambda, Fiber
         34     SDH                           Lambda, Waveband, Fiber
         35     SONET                         Lambda, Waveband, Fiber
         36     Digital Wrapper               Lambda, Waveband, Fiber

6.3. Generalized Label [GMPLS-SIG]

   As currently defined in [GMPLS-SIG], the waveband label space
   extension is well suited to cover the waveband granularity.

   In the context of waveband switching, the generalized label has the 
   following format:

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

        Waveband Id: 32 bits

           A waveband identifier.  The value is selected by the sender
           and reused in all subsequent related messages.

        Start Label: 32 bits

           Indicates the channel identifier, from the sender's
           perspective, of the lowest value wavelength making up the
           spectral frequency of the waveband.

        End Label: 32 bits

           Indicates the channel identifier, from the sender's
           perspective, of the highest value wavelength making up the
           spectral frequency of the waveband.

      Channel identifiers are established either by configuration or by
      means of a protocol such as LMP [LMP]. They are normally used in
      the label parameter of the Generalized Label on PSC and LSC.

   Waveband switching naturally introduces another level of label
   hierarchy and as such the waveband is treated the same way all other
   upper layer labels are treated in [GMPLS-SIG] and [GMPLS-ARCH].


6.4. Link Multiplex Capability [MPLS-HIER] û [GMPLS-ROUTING]

   A new WaveBand-Switch-Capable(WBSC) Link Multiplex Capability value
   shall be defined to identify and distinguish the associated
   multiplexing/demultiplexing capability of a link [MPLS-HIER].

   If a link switching is of type WBSC, it means that the node
   receiving data over this link (fiber) can recognize and switch
   individual WaveBands within the link (without distinguishing
   lambdas, channels or packets).

   [GMPLS-ROUTING] and the new value define the following Interface
   Switching Capabilities:

                 Packet-Switch Capable-1 (PSC-1)
                 Packet-Switch Capable-2 (PSC-2)

draft-douville-ccamp-gmpls-waveband-extension-00.txt     November 2001


                 Packet-Switch Capable-3 (PSC-3)
                 Packet-Switch Capable-4 (PSC-4)
                 Layer-2 Switch Capable  (L2SC)
                 Time-Division-Multiplex Capable (TDM)
                 Lambda-Switch Capable   (LSC)
                 Waveband-Switch Capable (WBSC)
                 Fiber-Switch Capable    (FSC)

   Note that the node that is advertising a given link (i.e., the node
   that is transmitting) has to know the "multiplexing/demultiplexing"
   capabilities at the other end of the link (i.e., the receiving end
   of the link). One way to accomplish this is through configuration.
   Other options to accomplish this are outside the scope of this
   document.

6.4.1. Waveband Switch Capable [GMPLS-ROUTING]

   If an interface is of type WBSC, it means that the node receiving
   data over this interface can recognize and switch wavebands (sets of
   contiguous lambdas) within the interface as a unit (without
   distinguishing lambdas, channels or packets). An interface that
   allows only one waveband per interface belongs to the WBSC type.

6.4.2. Interface Switching Capability Descriptor [GMPLS-ROUTING]

   For ISIS, the Interface Switching Capability Descriptor is a sub-TLV
   (of type 21) of the extended IS reachability TLV. The length is the
   length of value field in octets.

   For OSPF, the Interface Switching Capability Descriptor is a sub-TLV
   of the Link TLV with type 15. The length is the length of value
   field in octets.
   The common format of the value field is as shown below:

      0                   1                   2                   3

   A new value for the Switching Capability (Switching Cap) field shall
   be defined to identify the Waveband-Switch Capable (WBSC).

   In an Interface Switching Capability Descriptor, when the Switching
   Capability (Switching Cap) field contains the value for WBSC, the
   specific information field includes the Minimum LSP Bandwidth, which
   is the number of contiguous wavelength constituting a WaveBand
   entity.

   Traffic-Engineering (TE) to IGP Routing protocols extensions are
   defined in [OSPF-TE] and [ISIS-TE] which have been extended for
   GMPLS in [GMPLS-OSPF-TE] and [GMPLS-ISIS-TE]. It also refers to the
   notion of Forwarding Adjacency (FA) defined in [MPLS-LH] and
   supports Link Bundling as defined in [MPLS-BUNDLE].

   Routing information is transported by OSPF in Link State
   Advertisements (LSAs) grouped in OSPF PDUs, and is transported by
   IS-IS in Link State PDUs (LSPs). Two particular sets of information
   must be transported by a routing protocol to enable Optical
   MultiGranularity TE Routing. A ôstaticö set of information describes
   the capabilities of an Optical LSR and its optical links
   independently of their usage. A dynamic set of information describes
   the resources (signals) that are used at each link, i.e. the
   operational status of a link. As currently defined in [OSPF-TE-
   GMPLS] and [ISIS-TE-GMPLS], the corresponding TLV includes the basic
   link capabilities needed to encompass basic waveband switching TE.

6.5. LSP Regions [MPLS-HIER]

   The information carried in the Link Multiplex Capabilities is used
   to construct LSP regions, and determine regions' boundaries as
   defined in [MPLS-HIER].

   The introduction of the new Link Multiplex Capability WBSC define a
   new ordering among link multiplexing capabilities as follows: PSC-1
   < PSC-2 < PSC-3 < PSC-4 < TDM < LSC < WBSC < FSC.

6.5.1. Cascading of Forwarding Adjacencies [MPLS-HIER]

   Path computation may take into account this region boundary when
   computing a path for an LSP. When an LSP need to cross a region
   boundary, it can trigger the establishment of a Forwarding Adjacency
   (FA) at the underlying layer. The new cascading of FAs can be
   triggered between layers with the new following obvious order: L2SC,
   then TDM, then LSC, then WBSC and then finally FSC.

6.6. Signaling & Link Management Protocol Extensions

   Extensions to signaling protocols (RSVP-TE and CR-LDP) and Link
   Management Protocol (LMP) are for further study. These extensions
   are currently under definition and will follow the above proposal.

7. Security Considerations

   No additional security considerations beyond the one covered in
   [RSVP-TE] and [CR-LDP].
