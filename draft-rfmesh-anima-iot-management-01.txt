1.  Introduction

   When Anima ANI [I-D.ietf-anima-reference-model] was designed, IoT
   scenarios were under consideration.  For example, one big reason of
   introducing CBOR encoding [RFC7049] in GRASP [I-D.ietf-anima-grasp]
   and choosing CoAP [RFC7252] for secure bootstrapping
   [I-D.ietf-anima-grasp] is for the effiecency of transporting packets
   over lossy IoT networks.

   This document discusses applying GRASP and ACP into a specific IoT
   scenario for some network management functions.  The characterstics
   of the scenario is:

   o  Low-power wireless field area network dedicated for industrial
      usage (e.g. 6LoWPAN-based electronic metering network).

   o  The topology is mesh.  It is natrual for a wireless local network.

   o  IPv6 addressing, which is beneficial for auto-configuration

   o  L3 routing is enabled (e.g.  RPL).

   o  Nodes are extremelly resource constraind.  (E.g., one typical
      hardware model only has 128Kbytes RAM and 512Kbytes ROM. )

   o  Gateway is normally a resource rich device, which acts as a
      management server to the nodes.

   o  Normally nodes don't need to communicate with any other entities
      beyond the gateway.

   However, some of the ANI designs are not specifically optimized for
   IoT scenarios:

   o  Most of the GRASP messages (except M_Discovery and M_Flood) are
      over TCP, which is considered as a heavy burden on radio resources
      for many IoT LLNs.

   o  Since GRASP is based on TCP, it lacks reliable transport and
      fragmentation mechanisms by itself.

   o  VRF-based ACP is not applicapable for most of the small IoT
      devices.

   This document discusses choosing GRASP as the management protocol
   over the other two candicates, which are IETF Core technologies and
   OMA LWM2M technologies.  And also discusses a potential lightweight
   ACP.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119] when they appear in ALL CAPS.  When these words are not in
   ALL CAPS (such as "should" or "Should"), they have their usual
   English meanings, and are not to be interpreted as [RFC2119]key
   words.

   This document use the key words defined in [RFC7575] .

   The following additional terms are used throughout this document:

   o

   o  IoT: Internet of Things

   o  BR: Bord Router

   o  CMD: Command

   As Fig 1 depicted, the BR is the root of the wireless network and act
   as a management server.  Each node connects to the BR.

4.  Why Choose GRASP as Management Protocol

4.1.  Candidate Technologies

4.1.1.  IETF Core

   Some IoT network management standardization work has been initialed
   in the IETF Core working group.  [I-D.ietf-core-comi] describes a
   network management interface for constrained devices and networks,



Liu & Wu                 Expires March 30, 2019                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft      draft-rfmesh-anima-iot-management     September 2018


   called CoAP Management Interface (CoMI), which is used to access data
   resources specified in YANG, or SMIv2 converted to YANG; relevant
   YANG library for CoMI server [I-D.veillette-core-yang-library] and
   CBOR encoding of data modeled with YANG [I-D.ietf-core-yang-cbor] are
   also defined.  In a nutshell, these work items can be considered as
   some adaption and optimization of Netconf/YANG technologies for IoT
   environment.

   Netconf/YANG mechanisms are capabal of manuplating data orgnized in a
   sophisticated tree structure.  These capabilities are necessary and
   poweful in managing various device configurations, especially for the
   sophisticated devices such as router.  However, they might be too
   heavy for an extremly resource constrained device as discribed above.
   There is neither enough space for storing the programs in ROM, nor
   running the codes in RAM.

4.1.2.  OMA LWM2M

   OMA had issued the LWM2M specification, which is also designed for
   IoT network management.  LWM2M also chooses CoAP as the management
   protocol, but it doesn't choose YANG for data model, rather, it
   defined some OMA Objects.

   OMA objects less complete than YANG modeled data; the objects are
   flat rather than being orgnized as a tree structure.  But OMA objects
   contain also some advanced features such as access control of each
   object.  Plus the CoAP implementation, the LWM2M solution is still
   not ideal for the targeted scenarios in terms of ROM/RAM ocuppation.

4.2.  Suitability of GRASP

   According to Section 6.1 , most of the IoT commands are more like
   "Signallings" rather than traditional "Configurations".  It is
   reasonable because the IoT nodes need to auto-configure themselves as
   much as possible to gain maximum effiecency.  Relying on a
   centralized server configuring each node is a big challenge to the
   lossy wireless links and might probably cause significant delay of
   deployment.

   Thus, we might need a different approach to consider IoT management
   than just simply re-using Netconf/YANG in a different context (e.g.
   CoAP).

5.  GRASP Extention

   This section discusses potential GRASP extention to fulfill the IoT
   management requirements.

Internet-Draft      draft-rfmesh-anima-iot-management     September 2018


5.1.  GRASP over UDP

   Since TCP requires three times handshake, which would consume too
   much radio resource, thus it is not acceptable in LLNs.  Then UDP is
   needed.

5.2.  Reliable Transport

   For some critical messages, the sender would need to confirm the
   receiver had got the message, thus, there needs to be a reliable
   transport mechanism extended in application layer (GRASP).

5.3.  Fragmentation Handling

   Since the lack of TCP, GRASP also needs to be enhanced with some a
   fragmentation mechanism.

6.  IoT Management Options Definition

6.1.  IoT Management Signallings

   This section describes a set of IoT network management commands.
   These commands are based on a real commercial implementation,
   however, they are general network management functions that not
   coupled with any specific services.  Thus, these command could be
   considered as a representative of the general requirements of similar
   scenarios.

   1.  NETWORK_HEARTBEAT

   a.  BR sends heartbeat to node, every node relay to forward, ACK is
       optional.

   b.  node can send the ACK if needed.

   2.  NETWORK_DISMISS

   a.  CMD from BR to Node: No Options are associated with this CMD.
       This CMD will be sent in broadcast mode.

   3.  NODE_REMOVE

   a.  CMD from BR to Node: the destination IPv6 address will identify
       the target node to be removed.

   b.  ACK from Node to BR.

   4.  NODE_LEFT_REPORT

Internet-Draft      draft-rfmesh-anima-iot-management     September 2018


   a.  Parent node sends a command to BR that a node connected to it has
       left.

   b.  BR sends ACK to the parent node.

   5.  NETWORK_PARA_CONFIG

   a.  CMD from BR to Node.  BR send RF config to every node, based on
       broadcast relay, ACK is optional.

   6.  NODE_STATUS

   a.  Request.

   b.  Response.

   7.  NODE_STATISTICS

   a.  Request.

   b.  Response.

   8.  NODE_LOG

   a.  Request.

   b.  Response.

   9.  NODE_RESET

   a.  first response then reset, when node received this message.

   (Editor's Note: More commands to be extended.)

6.2.  GRASP Options

   We propose to define three Options as the following.  Each of the
   above mentioned IoT management signallings could be fit into one of
   the three options as different elements.

   - IoT Node Status Reporting.  (Details TBD.)

   - Management Commands to IoT Nodes.  (Details TBD.)

   - IoT Network/Node Configuration.  (Details TBD.)
