1.   Introduction
   
   The requirements for Assured Service are given in [Pierce1]. Many
   other drafts and RFCs have addressed the assumed architecture for the
   provision of SIP-based services. A lot of consideration has been
   given to continued reliance on the pure peer-to-peer model on which
   the Internet (and especially HTTP) has been based vs. migration to
   centralized control models in which dedicated proxies perform
   specific functions for the control of telephony services. This would
   include, possibly, full knowledge of the state of each call.
   
   While there is an wide-spread desire to maintain the peer-to-peer
   architecture, there has been increasing admissions in various drafts
   that centralized control or intelligent "middleboxes" are required in
   many cases. This list will likely continue to grow. Some examples
   are:
   
   1. The revision to RFC 2543 [SIP-2543bis] defines the notion of a
   "Call Stateful proxy", which "retains state for a dialog from the
   initiating INVITE to the terminating BYE request", i.e., for the
   duration of a call. However, no use of this state has been included
   in the current version of SIP [SIP-2543bis].

   2. Draft-ietf-sipping-cc-framework-00 includes the concept of a
   "central control" signaling model (although its reference to 3pcc
   indicates that the actual concept is not "centralized" but rather a
   specialized end-user performing control for other users.)
   
   3. The abstract for draft-ietf-sipping-service-examples-00 recognizes
   that "some [services] require the assistance of a SIP Proxy", but
   that "most ... shown in this document are implemented in the SIP User
   Agents". However, it then states that the flows shown assume "a
   network of proxies, registrars, PSTN gateways, and other SIP servers
   that have a pre-established trust relationship with each other...
   User agents wishing to use the services in this network are required
   to authenticate themselves with an edge proxy..."
   
   4. The draft for identity and privacy [SIP-IDENTITY] states that, in
   order for an originating device to achieve privacy concerning its
   identity related information, one must "assume an architecture where
   the caller initiates a session to the callee via a trusted entity in
   its network. The callee in turn receives the session initiation via a
   trusted entity". It further states that the "trusted entity ...
   belongs to and is controlled by the Network". 
   
   
2.   Architectures
   
   Various discussions and memos have identified two potential network
   architectures for the provision of SIP services. They are briefly:
   
2.1  End-to-end Architecture
   
   All service provision is between and under control of the calling and
   called party, referred to as "User Agent Client (UAC)" and "User
   Agent Server (UAS)", respectively. This terminology of "client" and
   "server" are based on the HTTP model from which this model is derived
   and have no real significance to this model. Either end can initiate
   a transaction. There is no device in between which provides service
   support, only routers for packets.
   
   (If a specialized back-to-back user agent (B2BUA) is used for some
   defined capability, that B2BUA simply acts as the termination point
   of two distinct sessions. There is no additional "network" function
   which associates the two sessions.)
   
2.2  Service Provider Network Architecture
   
   A Service Provider maintains and controls network elements which play
   an active role in the provision of services to end users. These
   network elements may be referred to as back-to-back user agents
   (B2BUA), proxies, servers, or middleboxes, but they all have the
   common characteristic of being provided by a Service Provider. These
   elements terminate SIP messages, perform service control, and send
   new or modified SIP messages to other network elements or to the
   other user.

3.   Required Architecture
   
   In order to provide the security and feature control required for
   Assured Service, it is necessary to utilize the Service Provider
   Network Architecture in which proxies are used to support call
   origination and termination for each user involved in the service.
   The architecture is the "trapezoid" described in [SIP-2543bis] and
   [SIP-IDENTITY] as follows (copied from draft-ietf-sip-srv-06):

   Interfaces:
   
   (1) Originating UA 1 to Proxy 1: Authentication and all SIP messages
       to/from UA 1
   (2) Proxy 1 to Proxy 2 (and to other devices such as policy servers):
       SIP messages and policy actions
   (3) Proxy 2 to terminating UA 2: Authentication and all SIP messages
       to/from U 2
   (4) Originating UA 1 to terminating UA 2: Voice packets
   
4.   Required Procedures
   
4.1  Authentication
   
   Each UA which might use the Assured Service capability must
   authenticate with a designated proxy before any service activation is
   attempted. Normally, this would be at the time the device is powered
   on, connected to the network, or is initialized, or it might be done
   at pre-determined time intervals. Whether or not this authentication
   requires a user interaction (human entry of a password, iris scan,
   etc.) is not important and depends on the application. Such an
   authentication may be very time consuming, with password verification
   and policy data-base look-ups. After this authentication, this proxy

Internet Draft    Architecture for Assured Service in VoIP    April 2002

   must handle all session establishment, both to and from this UA.
   
   This authentication function may be performed when the user attempts
   the first session setup, for example, when an individual is allowed
   to use a common device by first "logging on" with their identity and
   password. In fact, this is still an "authentication" function
   performed before the session setup is attempted. However, in this
   case, it must be understood that there may be an additional delay due
   to the authentication process before a call can be placed.
   
   This authentication process is not unique to the provision of the
   Assured Service capability. It is also required for many other
   services which are to be provided by the service provider's proxy
   based on pre-established authorizations.
   
   
4.2  Function of Proxy
   
   Besides the processing of the authentication, each proxy is
   responsible for a number of functions important to the provision of
   Assured Service (as well as other services) and the handling of
   interactions, where required, between different services. This
   includes (for Assured Service):
   
      - maintaining state of all existing sessions, including their
        priority, which exist on the UA (both proxies).
   
      - maintaining knowledge of other services being used by the UA
        which might need to be taken into consideration when applying
        the Assured Service capabilities (both proxies).
   
      - verifying that the originating UA is allowed to establish the
        session at the precedence level requested (originating proxy).
   
      - establish permission at the access router for it to handle the
        precedence marked packets from the UA (both proxies).
   
      - performing the timing function to control the diversion service
       (terminating proxy).
   
      - deciding when to preempt the end user and sending the
        appropriate preempt messages to the other party (both proxies).
   
      - maintaining records of the use of the service, whether for
        accounting or auditing purposes (both proxies).
   
4.3  Session Control
   
   Session establishment and release should follow the same message
   sequence as defined in SIP and its extensions for non-Assured Service
   calls. There should not be any additional messages. The only
   additional requirements are the inclusion of:

      - the priority level as defined in [Resource-priority] in the
        INVITE
   
      - security related information in every message which would
        consist of an authentication header (AH) using cryptographic
        techniques to allow the receiving end (user or proxy) to
        validate the authenticity of the message before acting on it.
        (This requirement is not unique to Assured Service, but is also
        required to secure other capabilities.)
   
5.   Security Considerations
   
   This memo mostly deals with the architectural requirements to provide
   the necessary security. While it does not attempt to define the
   actual security mechanisms used for authentication and authorization,
   it establishes the service architecture required.
