<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Peer-to-peer applications, such as file sharing, real-time
      communication, and live media streaming, use a significant amount of
      Internet resources. Such applications often transfer large amounts of
      data in direct peer-to-peer connections. However, they usually have
      little knowledge of the underlying network topology. As a result, they
      may choose their peers based on measurements and statistics that, in
      many situations, may lead to suboptimal choices. This document describes
      problems related to optimizing traffic generated by peer-to-peer
      applications and associated issues such optimizations raise in the use
      of network-layer information.

<a name="rfc.section.1"></a><h3>1.&nbsp;
Introduction</h3>

<p>Peer-to-peer (P2P) applications, such as file sharing, real-time
      communication, and live media streaming, use a significant amount of
      Internet resources <a class='info' href='#WWW.cachelogic.picture'>[WWW.cachelogic.picture]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Parker, A., &ldquo;The true picture of peer-to-peer filesharing,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> <a class='info' href='#WWW.wired.fuel'>[WWW.wired.fuel]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Glasner, J., &ldquo;P2P fuels global bandwidth binge,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>. Different from the client/server
      architecture, P2P applications access resources such as files or media
      relays distributed across the Internet and exchange large amounts of
      data in connections that they establish directly with nodes sharing such
      resources.
</p>
<p>One advantage of P2P systems results from the fact that the resources
      such systems offer are often available through multiple replicas.
      However, applications generally do not have reliable information of the
      underlying network and thus have to select among available instances
      based on information they deduce from empirical measurements that, in
      some situations, lead to suboptimal choices. For example, one popular
      metric is an estimation of round-trip time. This choice occurs before
      actual data transmission begins and thus before the peer can deduce
      actual throughput. Even with actual round-trip time, there may be
      bottlenecks or intermittent links that the round-trip time does not
      capture. Bottlenecks, limited throughput, and intermittent links often
      has much more influence on the peer's perceived quality of service and
      network utilization than round-trip time. Therefore, a peer selection
      algorithm that simply uses round-trip time often results in a
      sub-optimal choice of peer.
</p>
<p>Many of today's P2P systems use an overlay network consisting of
      direct peer connections. Such connections often do not account for the
      underlying network topology. In addition to having suboptimal
      performance, such networks can lead to congestion and cause serious
      inefficiencies. As shown in <a class='info' href='#ACM.fear'>[ACM.fear]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Karagiannis, T., Rodriguez, P., and K. Papagiannaki, &ldquo;Should ISPs fear Peer-Assisted Content Distribution?,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>, traffic
      generated by popular P2P applications often cross network boundaries
      multiple times, overloading links which are frequently subject to
      congestion <a class='info' href='#ACM.bottleneck'>[ACM.bottleneck]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Akella, A., Seshan, S., and A. Shaikh, &ldquo;An Empirical Evaluation of WideArea Internet           Bottlenecks,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>. Moreover, such
      transits, besides resulting in a poor experience for the user, can be
      quite costly to the network operator.
</p>
<p>Recent studies <a class='info' href='#ACM.ispp2p'>[ACM.ispp2p]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Aggarwal, V., Feldmann, A., and C. Scheideler, &ldquo;Can ISPs and P2P systems co-operate for improved           performance?,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> <a class='info' href='#WWW.p4p.overview'>[WWW.p4p.overview]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Xie, H., Krishnamurthy, A., Silberschatz, A., and R.

Bustamante, &ldquo;Taming the Torrent: A practical approach to reducing           cross-ISP traffic in P2P systems,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> show a
      possible solution to this problem. Internet Service Providers (ISP),
      network operators or third parties can collect reliable network
      information. This information includes relevant information such as
      topology or instantaneous bandwidth available. By providing this
      information to P2P applications, it would be possible to greatly
      increase application performance, reduce congestion and optimize the
      overall traffic across different networks. This document gives the
      problem statement of optimizing traffic generated by P2P applications
      using information provided by a separate party.

        are examples of contemporary solution proposals that address the
        problem described in this document. Moreover, these proposals have
        encouraging simulation and field test results. These and similar,
        independent, solutions all consist of two essential parts: </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>a discovery mechanism which a P2P application uses to find a
            reliable information source;
</li>
<li>a protocol P2P applications use to query such sources in order
            to retrieve the information needed to perform better-than-random
            selection of the endpoints providing a desired resource.
</li>
</ul>

<p>It is not easy to foresee how such solutions would perform in the
        Internet, but a more accurate evaluation would require representative
        data collected from real systems by a critical mass of users.
</p>
<p>However, wide adoption will probably never happen without an
        agreement on a common solution based on an open standard.

Definitions</h3>

<p>The following terms have special meaning in the definition of the
      Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) problem.
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Application:</dt>
<dd>A distributed communication system (e.g.,
          file sharing) that uses the ALTO service to improve its performance
          (or quality of experience) while optimizing resource consumption in
          the underlying network infrastructure. Applications may use the P2P
          model to organize themselves, use the client-server model, or use a
          hybrid of both.
</dd>
<dt>Peer:</dt>
<dd>A specific participant in an application.
          Colloquially, a peer refers to a participant in a P2P network or
          system, and this definition does not violate that assumption. If the
          basis of the application is the client-server or hybrid model, then
          the usage of the terms "client" and "server" disambiguates the
          peer's role.
</dd>
<dt>P2P:</dt>
<dd>Peer-to-Peer.
</dd>
<dt>Resource:</dt>
<dd>Content, such as a file or a chunk of a file
          or a server process, for example to relay a media stream or perform
          a computation, which applications can access. In the ALTO context, a
          resource is often available in several equivalent replicas. In
          addition, different peers share these resources, often
          simultaneously.
</dd>
<dt>Resource Identifier:</dt>
<dd>An application layer identifier
          used to identify a resource, no matter how many replicas exist.
</dd>
<dt>Resource Provider:</dt>
<dd>For P2P applications, a resource
          provider is a specific peer that provides some resources. For
          client-server or hybrid applications, a provider is a server that
          hosts a resource.
</dd>
<dt>Resource Consumer:</dt>
<dd>For P2P applications, a resource
          consumer is a specific peer that needs to access resources. For
          client-server or hybrid applications, a consumer is a client that
          needs to access resources.
</dd>
<dt>Transport Address:</dt>
<dd>All address information that a
          resource consumer needs to access the desired resource at a specific
          resource provider. This information usually consists of the resource
          provider's IP address and possibly other information, such as a
          transport protocol identifier or port numbers.
</dd>
<dt>Overlay Network:</dt>
<dd>A virtual network consisting of
          direct connections on top of another network, established by a group
          of peers.
</dd>
<dt>Resource Directory:</dt>

The Problem</h3>

<p>Network engineers have been facing the problem of traffic
      optimization for a long time and have designed mechanisms like <a class='info' href='#RFC3031'>MPLS<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosen, E., Viswanathan, A., and R. Callon, &ldquo;Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3031] and <a class='info' href='#RFC3260'>DiffServ<span> (</span><span class='info'>Grossman, D., &ldquo;New Terminology and Clarifications for Diffserv,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3260]
      to deal with it. The problem these protocols address consists in finding
      (or setting) optimal routes for packets traveling between specific
      source and destination addresses and based on requirements such as low
      latency, high reliability, and priority. Such solutions are usually
      implemented at the link and network layers, and tend to be almost
      transparent. At best, applications can only "mark" the traffic they
      generate with the corresponding properties.
</p>
<p>However, P2P applications that are today posing serious challenges to
      Internet infrastructures do not benefit much from the above route-based
      techniques. Cooperating with external services aware of the network
      topology could greatly optimize the traffic the P2P application
      generates. In fact, when a P2P application needs to establish a
      connection, the logical target is not a host, but rather a resource
      (e.g., a file or a media relay) that is often available in multiple
      instances on different peers. Selection of the closest one -- or, in
      general, the best from an overlay topological proximity -- has much more
      impact on the overall traffic than the route followed by its packets to
      reach the endpoint.
</p>
<p>Optimization of peer selection is particularly important in the
      initial phase of the process. Consider a P2P protocol such as
      BitTorrent, where a querying peer receives a list of candidate
      destinations where a resource resides. From this list, the peer will
      derive a smaller set of candidates to connect to and exchange
      information with. In another example, a streaming video client may be
      provided with a list of destinations from which it can stream content.
      In both cases, the use of topology information in an early stage will
      allow applications to improve their performance and will help ISPs make
      a better use of their network resources. In particular, an economic goal
      for ISPs is to reduce the transit traffic on interdomain links.
</p>
<p>Addressing the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) problem
      means, on the one hand, deploying an ALTO service to provide
      applications with information regarding the underlying network and, on
      the other hand, enhancing applications in order to use such information
      to perform better-than-random selection of the endpoints they establish
      connections with.

File sharing</h3>

<p>File sharing applications allow users to search for content shared
        by other users and download it. Typically, search results consist of
        many instances of the same file (or chunk of a file) available from
        multiple sources. The goal of an ALTO solution is to help peers find
        the best ones according to the underlying networks.
</p>
<p>On the application side, integration of ALTO functionalities may
        happen at different levels. For example, in the completely
        decentralized Gnutella network, selection of the best sources is
        totally up to the user. In systems like BitTorrent and eDonkey,
        central elements such as trackers or servers act as mediators.
        Therefore, in the former case, optimization would require modification
        in the applications, while in the latter it could just be implemented
        in some central elements.

Cache/Mirror Selection</h3>

<p>Providers of popular content like media and software repositories

        load balancing. Selection of the proper mirror/cache for a given user
        is today based on inaccurate geolocation data, on proprietary network
        location systems or often delegated to the user himself. An ALTO
        solution could be easily adopted to ease such a selection in an
        automated way.

Live Media Streaming</h3>

        destinations, in a real-time or near-real-time way. This is
        particularly important for users or networks that do not support
        multicast. Peers often participate in the distribution of the content,
        acting as both receivers and senders. The goal of an ALTO solution is
        to help peers to find the best sources and the best destinations for
        media flows they receive and relay.

Realtime Communications</h3>

<p>P2P real-time communications allow users to establish direct media
        flows for real-time audio, video, and real-time text calls or to have
        text chats. In the basic case, media flows directly between the two
        endpoints. However, unfortunately a significant portion of users have
        limited access to the Internet due to NATs, firewalls or proxies.
        Thus, other elements need to relay the media. Such media relays are
        distributed over the Internet with a public addresses. An ALTO
        solution needs to help peers to find the best relays.

ALTO Service Providers</h3>

<p>At least three different kinds of entities can provide ALTO
        services: </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Network operators: usually have full knowledge of the network
            they administer and are aware of the topology and policies that
            transit and peering traffic are subject to;
</li>
<li>Third parties: are entities different from the network
            operators, but which may have collected network information.
            Examples of such entities are content delivery networks like
            Akamai, which control wide and highly distributed infrastructures,
            or companies providing an ALTO service on behalf of ISPs (and thus
            acquire the information from the ISPs themselves);
</li>
<li>User communities: run distributed algorithms, for example for
            estimating the topology of the Internet.
</li>

Discovery of ALTO servers</h3>

<p>As a direct consequence of the totally decentralized architecture
        of the Internet, it seems almost impossible to centralize all
        information P2P applications may need to optimize traffic they
        generate. Therefore, any solution for the ALTO problem will need to
        specify a mechanism for applications to find a proper ALTO server to
        query.
</p>
<p>It is important to note that, depending on the implementation of
        the ALTO service, an ALTO server could be a centralized entity, for
        example deployed by the network operator, as well as a ephemeral node
        participating in a distributed algorithm.

User Privacy</h3>

<p>Information provided by the ALTO client querying the ALTO server
        could help increase the level of accuracy in the replies. For example,
        if the querying client indicates what kind of application it is using
        (e.g. real-time communications or bulk data transfer), the server will
        be able to indicate priorities in its replies accommodating the
        requirements of the traffic the application will generate. However, it
        is important that for using an ALTO service the application does not
        have to disclose information it may consider sensitive.

Topology Hiding</h3>

<p>Operators can play an important role in addressing the ALTO
        problem, but they generally consider network information they own to
        be confidential. Therefore, in order to succeed and achieve wide
        adoption, any solution should provide a method to help P2P
        applications in peer selection without explicitly disclosing topology
        of the underlying network.

<a name="rfc.section.5.5"></a><h3>5.5.&nbsp;
Coexistence with Caching</h3>

<p>Caching is a common approach to optimizing traffic generated by
        applications that require large data transfers. In some cases, such
        techniques have proven to be extremely effective in both enhancing
        user experience and saving network resources. However, they have two
        main limits in respect to the solutions based on the provision of
        topology information: </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Application specificity: since a cache is meant to replace the
            source of the content being accessed -- either explicitly or
            transparently -- it must be able to speak the same protocol with
            the querying peer. For this reason, caching solutions can be
            reasonably adopted only for the most popular applications, such as
            HTTP and BitTorrent.
</li>
<li>Content awareness: since caches need to store the content being
            delivered, they are subject to legal issues whenever the user does
            not have the right to access or distribute such content. This
            limitation makes caching approaches that do not (or cannot)
            support digital rights management unusable for distributing
            copyrighted material. Since, it is very difficult for an abstract
            file sharing proxy to know all of the legal parameters around
            distributing content, this makes caching unusable for many
            file-sharing systems. Since this is a legal and not technical
            issue, the solution would be at the legal, not network, layer.
</li>
</ol>

<p>In general, solutions based on provision of topology information
        need not interfere with caching. In fact, if the ALTO service used by
        applications is aware of the presence of caches, the service can
        indicate this in its response, marking them with higher priorities to
        achieve greater optimization.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>The approach proposed in this document asks P2P applications to
      delegate a portion of their routing capability to third parties. This
      gives the third party a significant role in P2P systems.
</p>
<p>In the case where the network operator deploys an ALTO solution, it
      is conceivable that the P2P community would consider it hostile because
      the operator could, for example: </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>redirect applications to corrupted mediators providing malicious
          content;
</li>
<li>track connections to perform content inspection or logging;
          and
</li>
<li>apply policies based on criteria other than network efficiency.
          For example, the service provider may suggest routes sub-optimal
          from the user's perspective to avoid peering points regulated by
          inconvenient economic agreements.
</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to note that ALTO is completely optional for P2P
      applications and its purpose is to help improve performance of such
      applications. If, for some reason, it fails to achieve this purpose, it
      would simply fail to gain popularity and the P2P community would not use
      it.
</p>
<p>Even in cases where the ALTO service provider maliciously alters
      results returned by queries after ALTO has gained popularity (i.e., the
      service provider plays well for a while to become popular and then
      starts misbehaving), it would be easy for P2P application maintainers
      and users to revert to solutions that are not using it.
