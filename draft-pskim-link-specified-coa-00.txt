Abstract

   This specification defines newly the care-of addresss configuration
   specified by the new link of the mobile node for Mobile IPv6 
   handovers in heterogeneous access networks, which allows the 
   correspondent node to know the new link of the mobile node. Using 
   the link specified care-of address, the correspondent node can adjust
   quickly real-time traffics according to the available bandwidth to 
   the mobile node.

1.  Introduction

   Recently, many works have been proposed to support seamless mobility 
   in future IPv6 based access networks [1]-[3]. One of the challenges 
   in keeping connection with the Internet, as a mobile node moves, is 
   to communicate efficiently on the move and to minimize to packet loss
   caused by a vertical handover in heterogeneous access network 
   environment where more and more mobile nodes equipped with multiple 
   interfaces for different L2 techonologies may reachable through 
   different links at the same time or use each interface alternately 
   depending on the network environment.  

   In recent, to indicate the new link of the mobile node for vertical
   handovers in heterogeneous access networks environment, the draft [4]
   was introduced a new model for link characteristic information 
   delivery from the mobile node to the correspondent node for Mobile 
   IPv6. The ultimate purpose of this model was to let the correspondent
   node properly adjust its real-time traffics to the mobile node 
   according to the new link of the mobile node. 
   
   In this dratf, for vertical handovers in heterogeneous access 
   networks environment, an alternative approach is suggested to allow 
   the correspondent node to know the new link of the mobile node for
   Mobile IPv6. This draft gives a new method for mobile node to create 
   a care-of address (CoA) which is specified by the new link. In this 
   method, an EUI-64 identifier for the CoA configuration is made from 
   an IEEE 48bit MAC identifier using the link type value. Then, the 
   correspondent node can know the new link of the mobile node from the 
   return routablility procedure including link specified CoA, whereas 
   the previous approach in [4] can know it from the binding update 
   procedure with additive mobility option. As proposed in [4], the 
   correspondent node in the propsed approach can also adjust real-time
   traffics according to the newl link's available bandwidth to the 
   mobile node using this link specified CoA. It is remarkable that the
   proposed approach can prepare more quickly to adjust real-time 
   traffics than the previous approach in [4], since the return 
   routability procedure precedes the binding update procedure.

3. Forming Care-of Addresse Specified by New Link Type

   According to the Mobile IPv6 specification, a mobile node should 
   generate a new primary care-of address (CoA) using normal IPv6 
   mechanisms, after detecting that it has moved to a foreign link.   
   A mobile node can have only one primary CoA at a time (which is 
   registered with its home agent), but it may have an additional CoA
   for any or all of the prefixes on its new link. Furthermore, since 
   a wireless network interface may actually allow a mobile node to be
   reachable on more than one link at a time (i.e., within wireless 
   transmitter range of routers on more than one separate link), 
   a mobile node may have CoAs on more than one link at a time.  

   In order to form a new CoA, a mobile node may use either stateless 
   [5] or stateful (e.g., DHCPv6 [6]) address autoconfiguration.  

   In case of the stateless address autoconfiguration, a mobile node can  
   generate its CoAs using a combination of locally available 
   information and information advertised by routers in foreign links.  
   Routers advertise prefixes that identify the subnet(s) associated 
   with a foreign link, while mobile nodes generate an "interface 
   identifier" that uniquely identifies an interface on a subnet.  
   An address is formed by combining the two. Generally, the CoA using
   stateless autoconfiguration has the following form:
   
   +---------------------------------+--------------------------------+
   | subnet prefix for foreign link  |interface ID (EUI-64 identifier)|
   +---------------------------------+--------------------------------+
      
3.1  New EUI-64 Format for Care-of Address   

   To indicate the currently active link of the mobile node for vertical 
   handovers in heterogeneous access networks environment, this 
   draft gives a new method to create a CoA which is specified by the 
   new link. In this method. a EUI-64 identifier is made from an IEEE 
   48bit MAC identifier using the link type value as shown in Table 1. 
   As shown in [7], in order to make 64 bits EUI-64 from 48 bits MAC,
   two hexadecimal values of 0xFF and 0xFE is added in the middle of 
   the 48 bit MAC (between the company_id and vendor supplied id).
   
   To create link specified CoA, the second hexadcimal value 
   "0xFE" will be replaced by the link type value defined as follows.
     
                    Table.1 Link Type Values   
      --------------------------------------------------------     
       link type value     IEEE link type
      --------------------------------------------------------
       0xFD                802.11b (WLAN)
       0xFC                802.11a (WLAN)
       0xFB                802.11g (WLAN)
       0xFA                802.11n (WLAN)

       0xC0-CF             IEEE 802.15 Family Networks
       0xB0-BF             Reserved for IEEE 802 Extensions

   For example, IEEE 802.11b WLAN has the 48 bit MAC as follow:     

   |0              1|1              3|3              4|
   |0              5|6              1|2              7|
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+
   |cccccc0gcccccccc|ccccccccmmmmmmmm|mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm|
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+

   where "c" are the bits of the assigned company_id, "0" is the value
   of the universal/local bit to indicate global scope, "g" is
   individual/group bit, and "m" are the bits of the manufacturer-
   selected extension identifier.  The link type value of IEEE 802.11b 
   WLAN is "0xFD", then the interface identifier with 64 bits EUI-64 for
    the link specified CoA is of the following form:

   |0              1|1              3|3              4|4              6|
   |0              5|6              1|2              7|8              3|
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
   |cccccc1gcccccccc|cccccccc11111111|11111101mmmmmmmm|mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm|
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
    
   As another example, the link type value of IEEE 802.16e 
   WLAN is assumed to be "0xD0", then the interface identifier with 
   64 bits EUI-64 for the link specified CoA is of the following form:

   |0              1|1              3|3              4|4              6|
   |0              5|6              1|2              7|8              3|
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
   |cccccc1gcccccccc|cccccccc11111111|11010000mmmmmmmm|mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm|
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+  

3.2  Adusting Real-time Traffics using Link Specified CoA

   It is shown that the correspondent node can adjust real-time traffics 
   according to the new link's available bandwidth to the mobile node 
   using the link specified CoA, when the mobile node is on the vertical
   handover in heterogeneous access networks environment.

   Assume that the mobile node communicates with the corresponding node 
   using available bandwidth for the current link. In real-time 
   communication, when the mobile node moves to the new link, it creates
   a link specified CoA using the new link's interface identifier. Then,
   the mobile node performs the binding procedure with its's home agent 
   to register its link specified CoA.   
   
   Then, for the binding procedure between the mobile node and 
   the correspondent node, the return routability procedure is performed 
   to enable the correspondent node to obtain some reasonable assurance 
   that the mobile node is in fact addressable at its claimed link 
   specified CoA as well as at its home address. Only with this 
   assurance is the correspondent node able to accept binding update 
   from the mobile node which would then instruct the correspondent node
   to direct that mobile node's data traffic to its claimed link 
   specified CoA. For the return routablility, the Home Test Init (HoTI)
   and Care-of Test Init (CoTI) messages are sent at the same time.

Internet-Draft         Link Specified CoA Configuration         Feb 2006   
   
   The procedure requires very little processing at the correspondent 
   node, and the Home Test (HoT) and Care-of Test (CoT) messages can be 
   returned quickly, perhaps nearly simultaneously. As shown in 
   Figure 1, the CoTI message uses the link specified CoA as the source
   address and the CoT messgage uses the link specified CoA as the 
   destination address.
   
   Thus, the correspondent node can recognize the new link of the mobile
   node from CoTI message and can prepare to adjust real-time traffics 
   with the mobile node using available bandwith of the new link.    
   After authorized binding procedure with the mobile node, the 
   correspondent node can adjust real-time traffic amount or pattern
   sent to the mobile node according to the new link's available 
   bandwidth. As mentioned in [4], the specific traffic control method 
   is also out of the scope of this document.

   As mentioned before, the correspondent node can know the new link of
   the mobile node from the return routablility procedure including 
   link specified CoA, whereas the previous approach in [4] can know it
   from the binding update procedure with additive mobility option. 
   Therefore, the proposed approach can prepare more quickly to adjust 
   real-time traffics than the previous approach in [4], since the
   return routability procedure precedes the binding update procedure.
