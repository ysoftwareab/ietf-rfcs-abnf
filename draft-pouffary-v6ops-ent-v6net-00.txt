INTERNET-DRAFT   draft-pouffary-v6ops-ent-v6net-00.txt    September 2002


1. Introduction

   IPv6 will be deployed in Enterprise networks. This scenario has
   requirements for the adoption of IPv6.  This document will focus upon
   and define: a set of technology scenarios that shall exist for the
   Enterprise network, the set of transition mechanisms needed by
   different scenarios, and the set of tools that shall be needed for
   IPv6 deployment.

   An Enterprise network for this document is a user network connected
   to an Internet Service Provider (ISP), is actively managed by the
   users of that network, and has multiple independent networks within
   the Enterprise.  It may also have mobile IP users accessing the
   Enterprise Network within the Enterprise (within the Enterprise
   Intranet) or from the public Internet into the Enterprise (to the
   Enterprise Extranet).  An Enterprise could be a Fortune 100 company
   large business (e.g. Manufacturing, Financial, Government) or a small
   office business (e.g. Law Firm, Stock Brokerage, Discrete Engineering
   Parts Supplier, Office of 30 users).

   The Enterprise network rate and methods for the adoption of IPv6 will
   vary and the only constant we can hope to define are the transition
   and tools requirements based on what we have learned currently from
   existing work on IPv6 transition mechanisms, current early adopter
   deployment, and the work we propose to do with this document.  This
   document will not declare specific transition mechanisms or tools for
   this scenario, but rather provide a template that users,
   implementors, and IETF specifications can use to apply or define such
   mechanisms and tools.  One of the documents goals is to have this
   work be a template for how existing transition mechanism and tools
   could be used in the Enterprise network scenario.

4. Design Team Assumptions

   In this section we will list our assumptions for this work. Such as
   no one can tell users how to transition they will all do it
   differently.  Some users will move right to IPv6 not later simply
   because it is easier especially those using 802.11 technology with
   Mobile IP.  Some users have hardly any IPv4 address space while
   others have plenty of IPv4 address space.  Global Address space vs
   private is a point of contention.  For peer to peer applications out
   of the Enterprise to another part of the Enterprise across the public
   Internet will require global addresses for peer to peer.

   There are really two approaches here, simple point-to-point which
   would require global addresses, and site-to-site vpn across the
   Internet which could get away with site-local.  The design team will
   spend time on this within each scenario and describe the consequences
   of each choice.

   We will discuss different deployment scenarios about cases that are
   known and show different perspectives.

   We also need to state our assumptions about our work vs ISP,
   Unmanaged, and 3GPP though these will apply to the Enterprise too.
   This will be one of our challenges.

   We will stay focused on transition and tools and the V6ops Charter.

   We will note mechanisms and tools that are needed within the
   scenarios.

   These are examples and discussions the design team is having
   currently.




5. Enterprise Network Scenarios


   We have begun discussions of the paradigms for the scenarios here are
   some examples of what we have determined given we just got started.
   Our initial consensus strategy is to discuss the scenarios first then
   enter the technical and transitional details below the scenarios.
   This will provide a point of reference to the technical and analysis
   sections below and provide the reader a context when reading the
   resolutions for this document.

      1) A large (20,000+ node) enterprise has an existing IPv4 network and
         wishes to turn on IPv6 for an engineering development group of
         ~100 clients that exist at two geographic sites. Each engineering
         group is on its own switched subnet. The IPv6 clients need to
         communicate with each other, but still need access to IPv4 based
         services provided by the corporation. What needs to be done to
         enable this deployment and where?

      2) An enterprise decides to deploy wireless services across their
         network, and for reasons of geography and topology groups of access
         points end up on different subnets. To optimize their support for IP

         mobility, they choose to make this service IPv6-only, while to secure
         the air link they choose to have all connections use a VPN access
         technology. These mobile IPv6-only nodes will still need access to
         legacy IPv4-only applications.

      3) A modest sized (<10,0000 nodes) multi-site enterprise has
         deployed IPv4-NAT with overlapping private address ranges between
         the sites. They are looking to improve productivity through a
         peer-to-peer conferencing application, that will need to work between
         sites. They are willing to update the operating systems running that
         application to support both IPv4 & IPv6, and over time will do the
         same for other services on the network. Which transition technologies
         are applicable initially as they begin using the application? What
         changes or additional technologies are applicable when the ISP for
         some, but not all sites, offers native IPv6 service? What transition
         technologies are applicable when all ISPs offer IPv6 services, but
         some of the internal nodes remain IPv4-only?


      4) A very large global enterprise interacts with the public Internet
         as a cohesive unit, but is composed of several administratively
         distinct business units. Some of the business units want to deploy a
         substantial number of stationary nodes (>10,000) in a single subnet,
         while having those subnets accessible by all the business units. To
         accomplish this as well as support wireless mobility and peer-to-peer
         conferencing, they choose to enable these new services as IPv6-only.
         At the same time there is need to support legacy IPv4-only applications,
         and access the public Internet from the wireless mobile nodes. What
         transition technologies are applicable when only parts of a
         geographically disperse business unit are capable of IPv6 packet
         forwarding? What transition technologies become applicable when an
         entire business unit is capable, but other business units are not
         fully capable? What transition technologies apply at the boundary to
         the public Internet?


      5) Two large enterprises using IPv4-NAT merge with the consequence
         that large segments of private network address space overlap. To allow
         the network operations to merge they decide to deploy IPv6 across
         the network core and support infrastructure first. What transition
         mechanisms apply to the process of migrating and managing the network
         core? What transition technologies apply to the support infrastructure?
         To further integrate the systems, what transition technologies are
         applicable to the end nodes?


   We will attempt to specify and define the scenarios in an incremental
   fashion.  Here are some current examples in our thinking.


        1.  Small network/single building/single location
        2.  Medium network/campus environment/single location
        3.  Large network/campus environment/multiple locations
        4.  Wireless/Mobility incorporation (which fits into any of
            the previous cases)

6. Enterprise Points of Transition

   The Enterprise network will have varying points of transition that
   will require different points of integration with IPv6 and IPv4.
   These points of transition are the fulcrum of the template to define
   what is required for Enterprise networks within the focus of this
   document.  Each subsection below this section will depict issues and
   deployment requirements for these Points of Transition.  At each
   point all the various sub-points from the client to the router to the
   Internet will be discussed.



6.1 Nodes Accessing IPv6 thru IPv4 Tunnels



6.2 Nodes Accessing IPv6 thru NAT



6.3 Nodes Accessing IPv4 Services within IPv6 Network



6.4 Nodes Accessing IPv6 Islands within IPv4 Network



6.5 Nodes Accessing IPv4 Islands within IPv6 Network



6.6 Mobile Nodes using the above Points of Transition



6.6.1 Mobile Nodes on the Enterprise Intranet



6.6.2 Mobile Nodes Accessing the Enterprise from the Internet



7. Software Points of Transition

   The Enterprise will be required to determine what software will be
   extended or affected by transtion and must be managed which will
   define the policy for the Enterprise.
