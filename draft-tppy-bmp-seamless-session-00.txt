             BMP (BGP Monitoring Protocol) Seamless Session
                   draft-tppy-bmp-seamless-session-00

Abstract

   This document describes an optional BMP session lifecycle extension
   to prevent data duplication of previously exported messages when TCP
   session is re-established.  It prevents loss of messages between TCP
   session re-establishments and increase overall BMP scalability.

1.  Introduction

   With the constant increase of BGP paths, the increase of BMP BGP RIB
   coverage from RFC8671 [RFC8671] and draft-ietf-grow-bmp-local-rib
   [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-local-rib], the addition of new TLVs such as
   draft-cppy-grow-bmp-path-marking-tlv
   [I-D.cppy-grow-bmp-path-marking-tlv] and draft-xu-grow-bmp-route-
   policy-attr-trace [I-D.xu-grow-bmp-route-policy-attr-trace], more BMP
   messages and BGP contexts, such as peering, route-policy or RIB, are
   exported from BMP client to server.

   With each BMP session re-establishment, clients export the initial
   BGP RIB via BMP route-monitoring messages as described in section 5
   of RFC7854 [RFC7854].  Regardless if the same messages were already
   exported in a previous BMP session or not.  This leads to data
   duplication and unnecessary strain of the BMP client and server.

   In a network most times BMP sessions are re-established within a
   short period of time due to connectivity interruption between BMP
   client and server or restart of the BMP server due to maintenance.
   Even though most BMP client implementations support a BMP buffering
   mechanism, messages are not buffered across BMP session re-
   establishment, thus leading to a loss of messages.

   Therefore, the proposed BMP session lifecycle improvement covers

   o  Brief loss of connectivity between BMP client and server

   o  Seamless Maintenance of BMP server

   It is based on RFC7413, TCP Fast Open [RFC7413], which allows
   previously established TCP transport sessions to be re-established
   more efficiently.

   This draft describes how the BMP application MUST behave during TCP
   transport re-establishment period in order to prevent metric loss.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Definitions

   Brief loss of connectivity between BMP client and server:  Describes
        a period of time, in seconds, starting from the point in time in
        which the BMP client detects loss of connectivity to the BMP
        server and tries to re-establish the TCP session.

   Maintenance of BMP server:  Describes a period of time, in seconds,
        starting from when the BMP server daemon is restarted for
        maintenance purposes and the BMP client tries to re-establish
        the TCP session.

4.  BMP Client and Server Capability

   To support brief loss of connectivity between BMP client and server,
   the BMP client and server MUST support TCP Fast Open as described in
   RFC7413 [RFC7413].

   To support seamless maintenance of a BMP server, the BMP client and
   server MUST support TCP Fast Open as described in RFC7413 [RFC7413]
   and the restart of the BMP server MUST distinguish between normal and
   seamless restart, wherever TCP Fast Open cookies are preserved or
   not.

5.  Updated BMP Session Lifecycle

   Section 3 of RFC7413 [RFC7413] describes the TCP Fast Open extension
   in the initial TCP SYN packet and the cookie handling during initial
   and subsequent re-establishment of the TCP transport session.

   Section 3.3 of RFC7854 [RFC7854] describes that the BMP session
   closes with the TCP session.  This behavior is extended with a
   configurable BMP session timeout.

Internet-Draft            BMP Seamless Session             February 2021


   The BMP session timeout starts counting down under the following
   conditions:

   o  Configured value is bigger than 0

   o  Current TCP session was established with Fast Open extension and
      cookie has been saved

   o  BMP buffer is not full

   o  TCP session is going to be terminated

   The default BMP session timeout is 60 seconds.

   While the time is counting down, all the BMP messages, regardless of
   message type, MUST be buffered.  At this stage, the BMP session is
   still considered to be alive.

   When a TCP session is re-established with TCP Fast Open extension and
   the cookie is identical to the previous TCP session with the same BMP
   peer, the BMP session remains alive, BMP buffer is exported and
   normal operation continues.

   When a TCP session is re-established without TCP Fast Open extension
   or with TCP Fast Open extension but the cookie is not identical to
   the previous TCP session with the same BMP peer, the BMP session is
   considered terminated and starts with a new BMP Initiation message.

   When a TCP session is not re-established within the configured
   timeout, then the BMP buffer is discarded and the BMP session is
   considered terminated.

   When the BMP buffer is full before the TCP session is re-established,
   then the BMP buffer is discarded and the BMP session is considered
   terminated.

6.  Security Considerations

   The same security considerations apply as for TCP Fast Open RFC7413
   [RFC7413].

7.  Operational Considerations

   From the perspective of the BMP server, the TCP Fast Open mechanism
   is rather transparent since it is entirely handled by the operating
   system kernel: this also means a BMP Server application can't
   determine if the TCP session was established with SYN Cookies or
   without them.

   Upon terminating the existing BMP session(s), the BMP server should
   dump to persistent storage the BGP RIBs currently in memory.  In
   terms of encoding, MRT format could be used for the task (ie.  draft-
   petrie-grow-mrt-bmp)

   At restart, the BMP server should first restore the content of BGP
   RIBs from persistent storage before accepting any incoming connection
   from BMP clients.  Only once this process is finished, connections
   can then be accepted again so that messages buffered by BMP clients
   are applied to the last known BGP RIBs upon termination.
