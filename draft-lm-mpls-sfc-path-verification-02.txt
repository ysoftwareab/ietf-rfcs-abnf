1.  Introduction

   Service Function Chain (SFC) defined in [RFC7665] as an ordered set
   of service functions (SFs) to be applied to packets and/or frames,
   and/or flows selected as a result of classification.

   SFC can be achieved through a variety of encapsulation methods, such
   as NSH [RFC8300], SR service programming
   [I-D.ietf-spring-sr-service-programming] and MPLS-based NSH SFC
   [RFC8595].

   This document describes extensions to MPLS LSP ping [RFC8029]
   mechanisms to support verification between the control/management
   plane and the data plane state for both SR-MPLS service programming
   and MPLS-based NSH SFC.

   An MPLS LSP ping is a component of the MPLS Operation,
   Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) toolset.  OAM packets used to
   monitor a specific Service Function Path (SFP) can be transported

   over a Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh).  This document defines the
   signaling of the G-ACh over an SFP with an MPLS forwarding plane
   using the basic unit defined in [RFC8595].  The document updates
   [RFC8595] in respect to SFF's handiling TTL expiration.  The document
   also describes the processing of the G-ACh by the elements of the
   SFP.

3.  MPLS-based SFP Consistency Verification

   MPLS echo request and reply messages [RFC8029] can be extended to
   support the verification of the consistency of an MPLS-based Service
   Function Path (SFP).

   SR-MPLS/MPLS can be used to realize an SFP.  Two methods have been
   defined:

   o  [I-D.ietf-spring-sr-service-programming] describes how to achieve
      service function chaining in SR-enabled MPLS and IPv6 networks.
      In an SR-MPLS network, each SF is associated with an MPLS label.
      As a result, an SFP can be encoded as a stack of MPLS labels and
      pushed on top of the packet.

   o  [RFC8595] provides another method to realize SFC in an MPLS
      network by means of using a logical representation of the Network
      Service Header (NSH) in an MPLS label stack.  This method,
      throughout this document, is referred to as SFC over an MPLS data
      plane (SFC-MPLS).  When an MPLS label stack is used to carry a
      logical NSH, a basic unit of representation is used, which can be
      present one or more times in the label stack.  This unit comprises
      two MPLS labels, one carries a label to provide a context within
      the SFC scope (the SFC Context Label), and the other carries a
      label to show which SF is to be enacted (the SF Label).  SFC
      forwarding can be achieved by label swapping, label stacking, or
      the mix of both.  When an SFF receives a packet containing an MPLS
      label stack, it examines the top basic unit of the MPLS label
      stack for SFC, {SPI, SI} or {context label, SFI index}, to
      determine where to send the packet next.

   In MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs), MPLS LSP ping [RFC8029] is used
   to check the correctness of the data plane functioning and to verify
   the data plane against the control plane.

   The proposed extension of MPLS LSP ping allows verification of the
   correlation between the control/management (if data model-based
   central controller used) plane and the data plane state in SR-MPLS/
   MPLS-based SFC.

   As for NSH-SR, OAM defined for NSH in [draft-ietf-sfc-multi-layer-
   oam] can be re-used and it is out of the scope of this document.

4.  LSP Ping in SFC-MPLS

   In SFC-MPLS, SFFs are responsible for MPLS echo request processing.
   there're two reasons:

   o  In SFC-MPLS, the packet forwarding decision is made by SFFs based
      on the basic unit.  SFs are not aware of the FEC of the basic
      unit.

   o  Generally, except for the designed specific functions, the packet
      processing functions supported by SFs are limited.  SFs may not
      support control and/or management protocols operated over the
      G-ACh defined in [RFC5586], e.g., MPLS OAM protocols like LSP
      ping.  Such packets may be mishandled.

   To support that processing, the basic unit can use the mechanism
   described in Section 4.1.

4.1.  Special-purpose Label in SFC-MPLS Environment

   When an SFC-MPLS is used, an SFF needs to identify an OAM packet with
   the SFP scope.  To achieve that, this specification first defines the
   use of a base special-purpose label (bSPL) [RFC3032] or an extended
   special-purpose label (eSPL) [RFC7274] (referred to in this document
   as SPL Unit) with the basic unit defined in [RFC8595].  And based on
   that, the use of Generic Associated Channel Label (GAL) [RFC5586]
   with the basic unit in the SFC-MPLS environment.

   Special-purpose label (SPL), whether bSPL or eSPL, has special
   significance in the data and control planes.  An ability to use an
   SPL in the basic unit allows for a closer functional match between
   the NSH-based SFC and SFC-MPLS.  For example, Entropy Label Indicator
   (ELI) [RFC6790] with the basic unit can be used as the Flow ID TLV
   [I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh-tlv] to allow an SFF to balance SFC flows among SFs
   of the same type.  An SPL MAY be used with the basic unit in SFC-
   MPLS, as displayed in Figure 1.  Note that an SPL unit MAY be present
   in one or more basic units when MPLS label stacking is used to carry
   the SFC information.

4.1.1.  G-ACh over SFC-MPLS

   SFC-MPLS environment could include instances of an SF (SFI) or SFC
   proxies that cannot properly process control and/or management
   protocol messages that are exchanged between nodes over the G-ACh
   associated with the particular SFP.  To support OAM over G-ACh, it is
   beneficial to avoid handing over a test packet to the SFI or SFC
   proxy.  Hence, this specification defines that if the Generic
   Associated Channel Label (GAL) immediately follows the SFC Context
   label [RFC8595], then the packet is recognized as an SFP OAM packet.

   Below are the processing rules of an SFP OAM packet by an SFF:

   o  An SFF MUST NOT pass the packet to a local SFI or SFC proxy.

   o  The SFF MUST decrement SF Label entry's TTL value.  If the
      resulting value equals zero, the SFF MUST pass the SFP OAM packet
      to the control plane for processing.  An implementation that
      supports this specification MUST provide control to limit the rate
      of SFP OAM packets passed to the control plane for processing.

   o  If the TTL value is not zero, the SFP OAM packet is processed as
      defined in Section 6, Section 7, and Section 8 [RFC8595],
      according to the type of MPLS forwarding used in the SFP.

4.2.  SFC Basic Unit FEC Sub-TLV

   Unlike standard MPLS forwarding, based on a single label, packet
   forwarding defined in [RFC8595] is based on the basic unit of MPLS
   label stack for SFC(SFC Context Label+SF Label).  A new SFC Basic
   Unit FEC sub-TLV with Type value (TBA1) is defined in this document.
   The SFC Basic Unit FEC sub-TLV MAY be used to carry the corresponding
   FEC of the basic unit.

                     Figure 2: SFC Basic Unit sub-TLV

   The format of the basic unit sub-TLV is shown in Figure 2 and
   includes the following fields:

      Route Distinguisher (RD): 8 octets field in SFIR Route Type
      specific NLRI [I-D.ietf-bess-nsh-bgp-control-plane].

      SF Type: 2 octets.  It is defined in [I-D.ietf-bess-nsh-bgp-
      control-plane] and indicates the type of SF, such as DPI,
      firewall, etc.

   Note: [I-D.ietf-bess-nsh-bgp-control-plane] covers the BGP control
   plane of MPLS-SFC as well.

   A node that receives an LSP ping with the Target FEC Stack TLV and
   the SFC Basic Unit FEC Sub-TLV included will check if it is its Route
   Distinguisher and whether it advertised that Service Function Type.
   If the validation is not passed, the SFF will generate an MPLS echo
   reply with an error code as defined in [RFC8029].

4.3.  SFC Basic Unit Nil FEC Sub-TLV

   [RFC8029] is based on the premise that one label corresponds to one
   FEC sub-TLV.  For example, in [RFC8029] section 4.4 step 4, before
   the FEC validation process of an intermediate node first the node
   should determine FEC-stack-depth from the Downstream Detailed Mapping
   TLV, and then if the number of FECs in the FEC stack is greater than
   or equal to FEC-stack-depth, FEC validation is triggered.

   In SFC-MPLS OAM, since one basic unit is related to only one FEC sub-
   TLV, there may be situations that the label stack in Downstream
   Detailed Mapping TLV contains two labels, but there is only one FEC
   in the FEC stack.

   The SFC Basic Unit Nil Sub-TLV(TBA2) is introduced in this document
   to ensure that the proper validation can still be performed.

                   Figure 3: SFC Basic Unit Nil sub-TLV

   SFC Context Label and SF Label are the actual label values inserted
   in the label stack; the MBZ fields MUST be zero when sent and ignored
   on receipt.

   The SFC Basic Unit Nil sub-TLV, when present, MUST be immediately
   followed by an SFC Basic Unit sub-TLV.  During FEC validation, an SFF
   should skip the SFC Basic Unit Nil sub-TLV and use the following SFC
   Basic Unit sub-TLV to validate the FEC of the basic unit.

4.4.  Theory of Operation

   An MPLS SFC validation request is an MPLS echo request with an SFC
   validation TLV, and the echo request is sent with a label stack
   corresponding to the SFP being tested.  To trace SFC-MPLS, the
   Generic Associated Channel Label (GAL), which immediately follows the
   SFC Context label is also included.

   If FEC validation is required, the SFC Basic Unit sub-TLV SHOULD be
   carried in the FEC stack of the request packet, and the SFC Basic
   Unit Nil sub-TLV MAY also be carried.  A Downstream Detailed Mapping
   TLV MAY be included in the MPLS echo request of the SFP.

   Sending an SFC echo request to the control plane is triggered by one
   of the following packet processing exceptions: IP TTL expiration,
   MPLS TTL expiration, or the receiver is SFP's egress SFF.

   As described in Section 4.1.1, the packet with GAL is recognized by
   the SFF as an SFP OAM packet.  The SFF then decrements the SF Label
   entry's TTL value.  If the resulting value equals zero, the SFF
   passes the SFP OAM packet to the control plane for processing.  The
   system that supports this specification then generates a reply
   message.

   In "traceroute" mode the TTL of the SF Label is set successively to
   1, 2, and so on.  After all SFFs on the SFP send back MPLS echo
   reply, the sender collects information about all traversed SFFs and

Internet-Draft              LSP Ping for SFC               February 2021


   SFs on the rendered service path (RSP).  But the TTL processing in
   SR-MPLS is defined in Section 6 of [RFC8595], as follows:

      If an SFF decrements the TTL to zero, it MUST NOT send the packet
      and MUST discard the packet

   and it excludes TTL expiration as the exception mechanism.  As a
   result, tracing a path of an SFC-MPLS-based service chain is
   problematic.  To support the tracing of an SFC, it must be changed to
   allow punting an OAM packet to the control plane though under
   throttling control.  Hence, this document updates Section 6 of
   [RFC8595] to state that:

      If an SFF decrements the TTL to zero, an OAM packet MAY be sent to
      the control plane given it does not exceed the configured rate
      intended to protect the system from the possible denial-of-service
      attack.

5.  LSP Ping in SR-SFC

   In SR service programming, the packet forwarding decision is made
   based on every single SID/label.  The SR proxy SHOULD process the OAM
   packet for the SF when the SF is not capable of doing so.

   If only the SFP connectivity check is required, the current LSP Ping
   for SR-MPLS [RFC8287] is sufficient.

   If operators want to check more information about the SFP(service
   segment related SF type, SR proxy type, etc.), new FEC sub-TLVs for
   the service segment should be defined.  Details of the new FEC sub-
   TLVs will be added in the further version.

6.  Security Considerations

   This specification defines the processing of an SFP OAM packet.  Such
   packets could be used as an attack vector.  A system that supports
   this specification MUST provide control to limit the rate of SFP OAM
   packets sent to the control plane for processing.

   This document defines additional MPLS LSP Ping sub-TLVs and follows
   the mechanisms defined in [RFC8029].  All the security considerations
   defined in [RFC8029] will be applicable for this document.

7.  IANA Considerations

   for TLV Types 1, 16, and 21" sub-registry of the "Multi-Protocol
