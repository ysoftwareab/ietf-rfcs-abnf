                    URN Namespace for ETSI Documents
                        draft-mahesh-etsi-urn-01

Abstract

   This document describes the Namespace Identifier (NID) 'etsi' for
   Uniform Resource Names (URNs) used to identify resources published by
   European Telecommuncations Standards Instititue (http://etsi.org).
   ETSI specifies and manages resources that utilize this URN
   identification model.  Management activities for these and other
   resources types are handled by the manager of the ETSI Protocol
   Naming and Numbering Service (PNNS).

1.  Introduction

   ETSI is a nonprofit international industry standards organization,
   that produces globally acceptable standards for Information &
   Communication Technologies including fixed, mobile, radio, broadcast,
   internet, aeornautical and other areas.

   As part of these specifications efforts, there is a need to identify
   identifiers in a managed namespace that are unique and persistent.
   To ensure that this namespace's uniqueness is absolute, a
   registration of a specific Uniform Resource Names (URNs) [RFC8141]
   Namespace Identifier (NID) for use by ETSI is being specified in this
   document, in full conformance with the NID registration process
   specified in the document.

2.  URN Specification for ETSI

   Namespace ID:

      etsi

   Registration information:

      registration version number: 1

      registration date: 2018-05-25

   Declared registrant of the namespace:

      Registering organization



         Name: European Telecommuncations Standards Institute (ETSI)

         Address: 650, Route des Lucioles, Sophia Antipolis 06560,
         France

      Designated contact:



         Role: ETSI Protocol Naming and Numbering Service (PNNS)

         Email: pnns@etsi.org

   Declaration of syntactic structure:

      The syntax of namespace specific strings for the 'etsi' namespace
      is <NSS> in Uniform Resource Names (URNs) [RFC8141].

   Relevant ancillary documentation:

      ETSI publishes information regarding the registered resources in
      the ETSI URN Namespace (EUN) registry
      (https://portal.etsi.org/PNNS/GenericAllocation/
      ETSIURNNamespace.aspx).

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

      ETSI will manage resource classes using the "etsi" NID and will be
      the authority for managing resources and associated subsequent
      strings.  ETSI is expected to guarantee the uniqueness of the
      strings themselves, or it may permit secondary responsibility for
      certain defined resources.

      ETSI could allow for use of experimental type values for testing
      purposes only.  Note that using experimental types may create
      collision as multiple users may use the same values for different
      resources and specific strings.

   Identifier persistence considerations:

      ETSI will update the ETSI URN Namespace (EUN) registry to document
      the registered resources that will use the "etsi" NID.

   Process of identifier assignment:

      Assignment of a URN from the ETSI namespace will be documented as
      part of the ETSI URN Namespace (EUN) registry.

   Process of identifier resolution:

      The namespace is not listed with an Resolution Discovery System
      (RDS).  Therefore this process is not relevant.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

      The entire URN is case-insensitive.

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

      No special considerations

   Validation mechanism:

      None specified.  URN assignment will be handled by procedures
      implemented in support of ETSI activities.

   Scope:

      Global

3.  Examples

   The following are examples of URNs that ETSI is looking to assign:

      urn:etsi:yang:etsi-services

      urn:etsi:yang:etsi-interfaces

4.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general,
   which are described in Function Requirements for URN [RFC1737],
   Uniform Resource Names (URNs) [RFC8141].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document adds a new entry ("etsi") in the urn-namespace
   registry.  This is the defining document.  When published, the entry
   can be found in the "Uniform Resource Names (URN) Namespaces"
