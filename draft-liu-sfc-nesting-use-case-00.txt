1.  Scenario

   This section discuss a deployment scenario of service function
   chaining.  The scenario discussed in this section is called service
   function chaining nesting.  As shown in figure 1, there are two types
   of service function chains.  The first type is SFC1.  There are two
   sub-type service function chains of SFC1, SFC1_1 and SFC1_2.  SFC1_1
   and SFC1_2 belongs to the same type of service function chain type
   SFC1.  The second type of service function chain is SFC2.  There are
   two sub-type service function chains of SFC2, namely SFC2_1 and
   SFC2_2.  There are two more types of service function chain of sub-
   type SFC2_1, namely SFC2_1_1 and SFC2_1_2.  For service function
   chain SFC2, there is one sub-type of service function chain called
   SFC2_2.

   The deployment scenario discussed above is an abstraction example of
   nesting type of service function chain.  A more concrete example is
   as follows:

   o  There are two tenants in a public cloud.  All of the first
      tenant's traffic is identified as SFC1 and all of the second
      tenant's traffic is identified as SFC2.  A more concrete example
      is that the first tenant is social networking service and the
      second tenant is online gaming service.

   o  For the social networking service traffic SFC1, the first sub-type
      of SFC1 is the traffic between users and it is identified as
      SFC1_1.  The second sub-type of SFC1 is the traffic for
      advertisement and it is identified as SFC1_2.  The traffic of both
      SFC1_1 and SFC1_2 belong to the same social networking service
      tenant but it may have different policies.  For example, the

      traffic between users may have higher priority compared with the
      traffic for advertisement.

   o  For the online gaming service SFC2, the first sub-type of SFC2 is
      the traffic of gaming interaction and it is identified as SFC2_1.
      There two more sub-type of SFC2_1, the first sub-type is the
      traffic that belongs to VIP users and it is identified as
      SFC2_2_1.  The other sub-type is the traffic that belongs to
      normal user and it is identified as SFC2_1_2.  Both the traffic of
      SFC2_1_1 and SFC2_1_2 belong to online gaming interaction traffic
      but it may have different policy.  For example, the traffic of
      SFC2_1_1 may have higher priority compared with the traffic of
      SFC2_1_2.

   o  The second sub-type of online gaming service is user payment
      traffic and it is identified as SFC2_2.  Both of traffic SFC2_1
      and SFC2_2 belong to the online gaming service tenant but it may
      have different policies.  For example, the online gaming
      interaction traffic may have higher priority compared with the
      payment traffic.

2.  Requirement of Service Function Chain Nesting

   Figure 2 shows the concept of service function chain nesting.

                 |

                 |
                 +-------SFC[Type3]

   Figure 2: Service Function Chain Nesting Concept

   The requirement of service function chain nesting is:

   o  The service function chain may have hierarchical structure.

   o  One service function chain type may have multiple sub-type of
      service function chain.

   o  One sub-type of service function chain should be identified which
      upper layer service function chain it belongs to.

   o  The number of levels of the hierarchical structure of a service
      function chain should not be limited.
