 Conveying Vendor-Specific Information in the Path Computation Element
    (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP) extensions for Stateful PCE.
                 draft-dhody-pce-stateful-pce-vendor-12

Abstract

   A Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains information on
   the current network state, including: computed Label Switched Path
   (LSPs), reserved resources within the network, and the pending path
   computation requests.  This information may then be considered when
   computing new traffic engineered LSPs, and for the associated and the
   dependent LSPs, received from a Path Computation Client (PCC).

   RFC 7470 defines a facility to carry vendor-specific information in
   Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP).

   This document extends this capability for the Stateful PCEP messages.

1.  Introduction

   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) [RFC5440]
   provides mechanisms for a Path Computation Element (PCE) to perform
   path computation in response to a Path Computation Client (PCC)
   request.

Internet-Draft               VENDOR-STATEFUL                    May 2021


   A Stateful PCE is capable of considering, for the purposes of the
   path computation, not only the network state in terms of links and
   nodes (referred to as the Traffic Engineering Database or TED) but
   also the status of active services (previously computed paths, and
   currently reserved resources, stored in the Label Switched Paths
   Database (LSP-DB).  [RFC8051] describes general considerations for a
   Stateful PCE deployment and examines its applicability and benefits,
   as well as its challenges and limitations through a number of use
   cases.

   [RFC8231] describes a set of extensions to PCEP to provide stateful
   control.  A Stateful PCE has access to not only the information
   carried by the network's Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), but also
   the set of active paths and their reserved resources for its
   computations.  The additional state allows the PCE to compute
   constrained paths while considering individual LSPs and their
   interactions.  [RFC8281] describes the set up, maintenance and
   teardown of PCE-initiated LSPs under the Stateful PCE model.  These
   extensions added new messages in PCEP for Stateful PCE.

   [RFC7470] defined Vendor Information object that can be used to carry
   arbitrary, proprietary information such as vendor-specific
   constraints.  It also defined VENDOR-INFORMATION-TLV that can be used
   to carry arbitrary information within any existing or future PCEP
   object that supports TLVs.

   This document extend the usage of Vendor Information Object and
   VENDOR-INFORMATION-TLV to Stateful PCE.  The VENDOR-INFORMATION-TLV
   can be carried inside any of the new objects added in PCEP for
   Stateful PCE as per [RFC7470], this document extend the stateful PCEP
   messages to also include the Vendor Information Object as well.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Procedures for the Vendor Information Object

   A Path Computation LSP State Report message [RFC8231] (also referred
   to as PCRpt message) is a PCEP message sent by a PCC to a PCE to
   report the current state of an LSP.  A PCC that wants to convey
   proprietary or vendor-specific information or metrics to a PCE does
   so by including a Vendor Information object in the PCRpt message.
   The contents and format of the object are described in Section 4 of

   [RFC7470].  The PCE determines how to interpret the information in
   the Vendor Information object by examining the Enterprise Number it
   contains.

   The Vendor Information object is OPTIONAL in a PCRpt message.
   Multiple instances of the object MAY be used on a single PCRpt
   message.  Different instances of the object can have different
   Enterprise Numbers.

   The format of the PCRpt message (with [RFC8231] as base) is updated
   as follows:

         <PCRpt Message> ::= <Common Header>
                             <state-report-list>
      Where:

         <state-report-list> ::= <state-report>[<state-report-list>]

         <state-report> ::= [<SRP>]
                            <LSP>
                            <path>
                            [<vendor-info-list>]
       Where:
         <vendor-info-list> ::= <VENDOR-INFORMATION>
                                [<vendor-info-list>]

         <path> is defined in [RFC8231].

   A Path Computation LSP Update Request message (also referred to as
   PCUpd message) is a PCEP message sent by a PCE to a PCC to update
   attributes of an LSP.  The Vendor Information object can be included
   in a PCUpd message to convey proprietary or vendor-specific
   information.

   The format of the PCUpd message (with [RFC8231] as base) is updated
   as follows:

         <PCUpd Message> ::= <Common Header>
                             <update-request-list>
      Where:

         <update-request-list> ::= <update-request>
                             [<update-request-list>]

         <update-request> ::= <SRP>
                              <LSP>
                              <path>
                              [<vendor-info-list>]
      Where:
         <vendor-info-list> ::= <VENDOR-INFORMATION>
                                [<vendor-info-list>]

         <path> is defined in [RFC8231].

   A Path Computation LSP Initiate Message (also referred to as
   PCInitiate message) is a PCEP message sent by a PCE to a PCC to
   trigger an LSP instantiation or deletion.  The Vendor Information
   object can be included in a PCInitiate message to convey proprietary
   or vendor-specific information.

   The format of the PCInitiate message (with [RFC8281] as base) is
   updated as follows:

                                 <PCE-initiated-lsp-list>
     Where:

        <PCE-initiated-lsp-list> ::= <PCE-initiated-lsp-request>
                                     [<PCE-initiated-lsp-list>]

        <PCE-initiated-lsp-request> ::=
                             (<PCE-initiated-lsp-instantiation>|
                              <PCE-initiated-lsp-deletion>)

        <PCE-initiated-lsp-instantiation> ::= <SRP>
                                              <LSP>
                                              [<END-POINTS>]
                                              <ERO>
                                              [<attribute-list>]
                                              [<vendor-info-list>]

        Where:

        <vendor-info-list> ::= <VENDOR-INFORMATION>
                               [<vendor-info-list>]

      <PCE-initiated-lsp-deletion> and <attribute-list> is as per
      [RFC8281].

   A legacy implementation that does not recognize the Vendor
   Information object will act according to the procedures set out in
   [RFC8231] and [RFC8281].  An implementation that supports the Vendor
   Information object, but receives one carrying an Enterprise Number
   that it does not support, MUST ignore the object in the same way as
   described in [RFC7470].

3.  Procedures for the Vendor Information TLV

   The Vendor Information TLV can be used to carry vendor-specific
   information that applies to a specific PCEP object by including the
   TLV in the object.  This includes objects used in Stateful PCE
   extension such as SRP and LSP object.  All the procedures as per
   section 3 of [RFC7470].

4.  Vendor Information Object and TLV

   [RFC7470] specify the format of VENDOR-INFORMATION Object and VENDOR-
   INFORMATION-TLV.

5.  Manageability Considerations

   All manageability requirements and considerations listed in
   [RFC5440], [RFC7470] and [RFC8231] apply to PCEP protocol extensions
   defined in this document.  In addition, requirements and
   considerations listed in this section apply.

5.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   As stated in [RFC7470], this capability, the associated vendor
   specific information and policy SHOULD made configurable.  This
   information can be used in Stateful PCEP messages as well.

5.2.  Information and Data Models

   The PCEP YANG module is specified in [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-yang].  It is
   NOT RECOMMENDED that standard YANG module be augmented with details
   of vendor information.  It MAY be extended to include the use of this
   information and the Enterprise Numbers that the object and TLVs
   contain.

5.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new liveness
   detection and monitoring requirements in addition to those already
   listed in [RFC5440].

5.4.  Verify Correct Operations

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new operation
   verification requirements in addition to those already listed in
   [RFC5440] and [RFC8231].

5.5.  Requirements On Other Protocols

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new requirements
   on other protocols.

5.6.  Impact On Network Operations

   Mechanisms defined in [RFC5440] and [RFC8231] also apply to PCEP
   extensions defined in this document.  Further, the mechanism
   described in this document can help the operator to request control
   of the LSPs at a particular PCE.

6.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA consideration in this document.

7.  Implementation Status

   [NOTE TO RFC EDITOR : This whole section and the reference to RFC
   7942 is to be removed before publication as an RFC]

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

8.  Security Considerations

   The protocol extensions defined in this document do not change the
   nature of PCEP.  Therefore, the security considerations set out in
   [RFC5440], [RFC7470], [RFC8231] and [RFC8281] apply unchanged.

   As stated in [RFC6952], PCEP implementations SHOULD support the TCP-
   AO [RFC5925] and not use TCP MD5 because of TCP MD5's known
   vulnerabilities and weakness.  PCEP also support Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) [RFC8253] as per the recommendations and best current
   practices in [RFC7525].
