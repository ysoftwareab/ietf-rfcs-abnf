Abstract 
    
   This draft describes an Ethernet [IEEE-802.3] L2VPN model that 
   provides point-to-point and point-to-multipoint Layer 2 data 
   communication services using a hierarchical LAN switching 
   architecture.  The model is based on a MAC-in-MAC frame format. 
   Scalability and manageability is achieved by simplifying the control 
   plane at the cost of adding functionality to the forwarding plane.

1. Introduction 
    
   Service Providers require a low-cost, scalable method of providing 
   ubiquitous data services.  They have indicated that Ethernet-based 
   services are the interface of choice to provide this service.  The 
   service must be "low-cost" in terms of the cost of operations for the 
   Customer and Provider, and the cost of deployment for the Provider. 
    
   This draft describes a ôVirtual Hierarchical LAN Servicesö model.  In 
   this model an Ethernet L2VPN is supported by building the network 
   using a hierarchical architecture.  At the lowest level of hierarchy, 
   customer edge devices (CE) communicate with service provider devices 
   (L2PE) using standard Ethernet frames.  This is also the service 
   demark point.  The second level of hierarchy is added by the service 
   provider device (L2PE) which encapsulates the customer frame with an 
   additional MAC header. As part of this additional MAC header a VPN 
   identifier is also added to the frame encapsulation. 
    
   This encapsulated frame can then be forwarded over a backbone network 
   by a provider edge device (PE).  In its simplest form the backbone 
   network can be an Ethernet bridge.  The backbone network can also be 
   based on an MPLS architecture, made up of a mesh of pseudo wires that 
   connect the set of provider edge devices in a split horizon manner.  
   The pseudo wires can be MPLS tunnels or VC labels as defined in 
   [PWE3-CTRL]. Since each frame includes the VPN identifier a fully 
   connected mesh of VC's must be established to all PE devices. Per VPN 
   per PE VC establishment over the backbone network is not required. 
    
   Thus the hierarchical approach provides the following advantage: 
    
   1) Many customer MAC addresses are represented by the combination of 
      an L2VPN identifier and a single provider-managed MAC address.  
      This reduces the number of MAC addresses that need to be managed 
      by the core network devices. 
    
   2) Simplification of the core network operation by reducing the 
      number of pseudo-wires required for the L2VPN service. 
    
   The model also describes a broadcast and multicast service that 
   limits the replication of frames in the service providers backbone 
   network. 
    
   This draft describes extensions to [PWE3-CTRL] to support the setup 
   of the VC mesh between the PE devices.

2. Reference Model 
    
   The following network diagram shows the elements needed to support 
   the Ethernet-based L2VPN service.  The reference model presents three 
   logical functions represented by: Customer Edge (CE) devices, Layer 2 
   Provider Edge (L2PE) devices and Provider Edge (PE) devices.  CE 
   devices belong to a customer while the PE and L2PE devices belong to 
   a service provider.  The service provider backbone network can be 
   based on any technology such as Bridging, MPLS, L2TP, GRE, IP in IP 
   etc. 
    
   The diagram shows customers connected to three L2VPNs represented by 
   x, y and z.  CE devices connect to L2PE devices, each of which 
   support many L2VPNs.  L2PE devices connect to PE devices that support 
   connectivity to a backbone network. 
    
   In the diagram below the Service Provider Backbone Network is 
   demarked by the ". . .".  The backbone network must be able to 
   support point-to-point communication at a minimum.  Support for 
   point-to-multipoint communication is desirable but not required.

   CE devices could be hosts, Layer 2 switches or Layer 3 routers.  The 
   model REQUIRES that the link that connects the CE devices to the L2PE 
   devices carry Ethernet Frames. Frames with and without VLAN tags 
   [IEEE-802.1Q] are supported. 
    
   A CE device can connect to many L2PE devices, however the L2PE device 
   MUST ensure that only one of these links is active at a time, with 
   the other links in stand-by mode. 
    
   L2PE devices are Virtual Hierarchical LAN switches.  Typically there 
   are many CE devices that connect to a single L2PE device.  L2PE 
   devices provide switching and replication services for the CE devices 
   connected to them.  All L2PE interfaces MUST support the transport of 
   Ethernet frames.  L2PE devices MUST have at least one active 
   interface that connects to the PE device.  When more than one 
   interface connects to one or more PE devices, control mechanisms MUST 
   be used to insure that only one is active and all others are in 
   stand-by mode. 
    
   L2PE devices are assigned a single MAC address.  When an L2PE device 
   has two uplinks to different PE devices the same MAC address is used 
   on both links. This allows redundancy to be implemented in a manner 
   that does not require remote ends to know about a failure. 
    
   PE devices support interfaces that connect to L2PE devices and 
   interfaces that connect to the backbone network.  The interfaces that 
   connect to L2PE devices MUST support Ethernet frames. 
    
   PE devices MUST be able to address each L2PE device that it is 
   connected to using a unique MAC address.  L2PE devices MUST be able 
   to address a single PE device. Any network topologies that prevent 
   this are not supported. 
    
   Both PE and L2PE devices must support basic Ethernet services such as 
   the frame replication of broadcast and multicast addressed frames. 
    
   In the network reference diagram above, frame replication services 
   for customer devices CEx2 and CEx3 are provided by L2PEc.  
   Replication services for customer devices CEy2 and CEy3 are provided 
   by L2PEd.  All other replication services are provided by PE1, PE2 or 
   PE3.  This replication hierarchy minimizes broadcast traffic on the 
   service provider's backbone network. 
    
    
3. Backbone Network 
 
   The draft describes requirements for an MPLS based backbone network.  
   As earlier mentioned other backbone architectures are also supported

   and details of these architectures will be described in a later 
   version of this draft. 
    
   The L2VPN backbone network is configured by defining the VPNs that 
   are supported by each PE device.  The PE device then uses an auto-
   discover procedure to determine the other PE devices in the backbone 
   network that it must communicate with.  Many of these methods are 
   already discussed in the PPVPN working group, however details will be 
   provided in a later revision of this draft. 
    
    
3.1 LDP Based Signaling  
        
   In order to establish a full mesh of pseudo-wires, all PEs in an 
   L2VPN network must have a full mesh of LDP sessions.  
        
   Once an LDP session has been formed between two PEs, pseudo-wires   
   are signaled over this session.  
        
   In [PWE3-CTRL], the L2 VPN information is carried in a Label Mapping 
   message sent in downstream unsolicited mode, which contains   the 
   following VC FEC TLV.  VC TLV, C, VC Info Length, Group ID, VC-ID and 
   Interface parameters are as defined in [PWE3-CTRL].

   VC types 0x0004 and 0x0005 identify VC LSPs that carry VLAN tagged 
   and untagged Ethernet traffic respectively, for point-to-point 
   connectivity.  
        
   We define a new VC type, Ethernet VHLS, with code-point 0x000E to 
   identify VC LSPs that carry Ethernet traffic for multipoint 
   connectivity.  For VC types 0x0001 to 0x000A, the VC ID identifies a 
   particular VC. For the VHLS VC type, the VC ID identifies a 
   particular pseudo-wire (VC-LSP) that supports the VHLS application. 
 
   Note the contrast between VPLS, as defined in [VPLS], and VHLS in how 
   the VC-ID is interpreted.  In VPLS the VC-ID identifies the VPLS 
   instance while in VHLS the VC-ID identifies the VHLS service.  The 
   VHLS instance is derived from the VPN identifier present in the VHLS 
   header of the data packet.  This distinction is key in reducing the 
   number of pseudo-wires required for the multi-point Ethernet service. 
    
   When setting up LSPs the PE device must connect to Npe(vpn) PE 
   devices that support the particular VPN.  In VPLS the number of 
   pseudo-wires required for a PE device is (Npe(vpn1) - 1) + (Npe(vpn2) 
   - 1) + ... (Npe(vpnm) - 1) for m number of VPNs that this particular 
   PE device supports.  In VHLS the number of pseudo-wires required per 
   PE device is (Npe - 1), where Npe is the number of PE devices that 
   support the common VPNs supported by the connected PE devices.  Thus 
   the VHLS model simplifies the signaling overhead and management of 
   pseudo-wires. 
    
    
3.2 QOS 
    
   It is desirable to offer multi-tiered QOS as part of the L2VPN 
   service.  It is especially useful to provide preferential treatment 
   of control frames such as OAM and Spanning Tree Bridge PDUs at each 
   intermediary node as well as within the core network.  In some cases 
   a service provider may want an altogether different path to carry 
   certain packets, for example broadcast data.  In all such cases, a 
   different set of pseudo-wires is required to be signaled over the new 
   LSP tunnel.   
    
   The VHLS architecture offers a more scalable solution than the VPLS 
   architecture when additional pseudo-wires are needed.  In VHLS, a PE

   node may signal a pseudo-wire to carry broadcasts of all VPNs as 
   compared to VPLS where a PE node must signal a separate pseudo-wire 
   to carry broadcast data for each VPN. 
    
    
4. Frame Processing 
    
   The following sections describe the frame encapsulations used by the  
   VHLS model and how each intermediary device process such encapsulated 
   frames for database maintenance and frame forwarding functions. 
 
   The VHLS model is supported by the L2PE and PE devices.  The VHLS 
   model requires special frame formats between these VHLS devices.  The 
   frames received from CE devices are encapsulated by L2PE devices into 
   hierarchical MAC frames that have enough information so that PE and 
   L2PE devices can "learn" the source L2PE device of these frames.  The 
   frame must also include information that limits the replication of 
   broadcast and multicast frames within the L2VPN.  The hierarchical 
   encapsulation frame headers used by the L2PE and PE devices are 
   stripped before transmitting frames to the CE devices. 
    
   Each L2PE device is assigned a single MAC address, which is used to 
   uniquely identify the L2PE device within the service provider's 
   network.  In addition an L2VPN identifier is required.  This 
   identifier is used to determine frame handling characteristics, such 
   as broadcast scope, that is particular to the L2VPN. 
    
   The VHLS model defines a new Ethernet type to support the definition 
   of a VHLS L2VPN identifier and control word (VIC).  The value of the 
   Ethernet type is TBD and is referred to as VHLS ether-type (VET).  
   The VIC is a 32-bit field as described below: 
    
    
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-----------------------------------------------+ 
   |O|C|r|r|r|Q|Q|Q|             24-bit L2VPN identifier           | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-----------------------------------------------+ 
    
   The first 8-bits define a VHLS Control Field. The next 24-bits define 
   a VHLS L2VPN identifier that is administered by the Service Provider.  
   This L2VPN identifier is used to separate data between customers, and 
   is globally unique for a service provider's network. 
    
   The VHLS L2VPN identifiers 0 and 16777215 are reserved. 
    
   Bit 0 of the 8-bit Control Field (O) is defined as an OAM indicator.  
   Bit 1 is defined as a CRC indicator.  Bits 2 through 4 (r) are 
   reserved.  Bits 5 through 7 (Q) define the QOS field.  The use of the 
   QOS field is dependent on the architecture of the service provider

   network.  Details of the OAM indicator are TBD and the bit must be 
   currently set to zero. Details of the CRC indicator are described in 
   section 4.2.  All reserved bits must be set to zero. 
    
    
4.1 CE Frame Processing 
    
   This model does not require that the CE devices perform any special 
   frame processing in addition to that provided by a typical device 
   attached to an Ethernet LAN. 
    
   The following frame formats are supported: 
    
   +-------+-------+-----+-------------------------------------+-------+ 
   | MACDA | MACSA | T/L |              Information            | CRC32 | 
   +-------+-------+-----+-------------------------------------+-------+ 
    
   +-------+-------+----+------+-----+-------------------------+-------+ 
   | MACDA | MACSA |8100| VLAN | T/L |        Information      | CRC32 | 
   +-------+-------+----+------+-----+-------------------------+-------+ 
    
   These frames are received and transmitted by the L2PE devices on CE 
   facing interfaces and processed as described below. 
    
    
4.2 L2PE Frame Processing 
    
   All frames received or transmitted over L2PE to PE interfaces are 
   encapsulated by the L2PE device within a hierarchical MAC frame as 
   described below. 
    
   +---------+---------+-----+-----+-----------------------------+-----+ 
   |BCST-ADDR| L2PE-SA | VET | VIC |           CE Frame          |CRC32| 
   +---------+---------+-----+-----+-----------------------------+-----+ 
    
   +---------+---------+-----+-----+-----------------------------+-----+ 
   | L2PE-DA | L2PE-SA | VET | VIC |           CE Frame          |CRC32| 
   +---------+---------+-----+-----+-----------------------------+-----+ 
    
   The first frame, which uses a broadcast MAC address (BCST-ADDR) is 
   used when the CE frame contains a MAC destination address that is 
   unknown.  After a learning process, L2PE devices will map the CE 
   MACDA to a L2PE-DA so using the second frame format. 
    
   In the above frame formats the CE frame SHOULD include the original 
   CRC32 to allow detection of bit errors introduced by devices in the 
   service provider network or devices attached to the service provider 
   network.  When the CRC32 of the CE frame is included the CRC 
   indicator bit in the VIC must be set.  If the L2PE device needs to

   modify the CE frame it MAY calculate and add a new CRC32 to the CE 
   frame or it MAY strip the CRC32 of the CE frame and clear the CRC 
   indicator bit in the VIC. 
    
   The L2PE maintains a MAC address table per L2VPN defined.  When 
   transmitting a CE frame to a PE device, the L2PE-SA in the frame is 
   the MAC address of the transmitting L2PE device.  The L2PE must learn 
   the addresses of remote L2PE devices and map these to the CE MAC 
   addresses within the L2VPN. 
    
   The L2PE device supports a forwarding data base.  The data base is 
   keyed using the CE MACDA and the L2VPN identifier.  The data for each 
   keyed entry that belongs to a CE connected interface contains the 
   identity of the CE interface.  The data for each keyed entry that 
   belongs to a L2PE interface contains the L2PE-DA MAC address. 
    
   The L2PE MUST use the configured L2VPN identifier for this interface 
   and perform a lookup of the CE MACDA within the L2VPN forwarding 
   table for the received frame. 
    
   If the MACDA is unknown the frame is forwarded using an L2PE MACDA of 
   FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF to all interfaces that belong to the L2VPN.  If the 
   MACDA is known it is forwarded to the appropriate interface.  In both 
   cases the interface could be a CE interface or a PE interface, also 
   the appropriate frame format must be used.  When forwarding frames to 
   a PE interface it uses the hierarchical frame format.  The MACDA in 
   the hierarchical Ethernet header is the learnt L2PE-MACDA or the 
   L2PE-BCST MAC address.  The MACSA is the MAC address assigned to the 
   L2PE device.  The Ethernet type is set to VET and the next 4 bytes 
   are the VIC field.  The Q bits in the VIC field depend on the QOS 
   architecture in use.  The information field in this MAC frame is the 
   CE MAC frame. 
    
   The L2PE will also perform a lookup using the CE MACSA and the 
   configured L2VPN identifier within the L2VPN forwarding table.  This 
   is required to learn the source of the CE frame. 
    
   On receiving frames from the connected PE device, the L2PE will use 
   the CE MACDA and the L2VPN identifier in the received frame to 
   perform a lookup within the forwarding table.  If the lookup returns 
   a CE interface as the destination, the CE frame is forwarded to this 
   interface.  If the lookup returns a network-facing interface the 
   frame is dropped. If the lookup results in a failure, the CE frame is 
   flooded to all CE interfaces that support traffic to the particular 
   L2VPN.  The L2PE will also perform the learning function on the CE 
   MACSA and map it to the L2PE MAC address and L2VPN identifier as 
   learnt from the received frame. 
    
   The L2PE device performs "aging" on all MAC addresses learnt.

4.3 L2PE Frame Processing for frames with 802.1Q VLAN Tags 
    
   When L2PE devices are connected to CE devices that support VLAN tags 
   in a non-transparent manner, they must be configured as such and each 
   VLAN tag MUST be assigned to a unique L2VPN identifier.  This ensures 
   that the PE devices can perform forwarding and control functions for 
   both types of Ethernet frames in a similar and consistent manner. 
 
 
4.4 PE Frame Processing 
    
   PE devices support the following frame processing methods depending 
   on which interface the frame is received, and the type of frame 
   received.  Frames received from PE devices over the backbone network 
   MUST be forwarded to L2PE devices.  Frames received from L2PE devices 
   can be forwarded to other L2PE devices and/or remotely connected PE 
   devices using the backbone network.  
    
   PE frame processing assumes that the service provider's backbone 
   network architecture supports point-to-point and multipoint frame 
   processing. The backbone network architecture must support the 
   ability to link a tunnel in one direction between end-points to a 
   tunnel in the reverse direction between the same end-points so that 
   learning in one direction can be used to forward data in the reverse 
   direction. 
    
   The PE device is responsible for providing replication services.  The 
   L2VPN topology is used to determine the destinations to which 
   broadcast frames must be replicated.  PE devices receiving broadcast 
   frames on backbone interfaces will not forward these frames to other 
   PE devices.   
    
   PE devices maintain a forwarding database that have two types of 
   keys.  The first key is used for frames received from backbone 
   interfaces and depends on the architecture of the backbone network.  
   The data associated with this key typically will include information 
   that results in the PE performing an additional lookup based on the 
   second key.  The second key is made up of the L2PE-DA address and the 
   L2VPN identifier received in the frame.  Frame processing details of 
   the first key is dependent on the backbone network architecture and 
   is thus beyond the scope of this draft, in fact in some architectures 
   it may not be required.   
    
   The PE device processes frames received from L2PE devices in two 
   different ways depending on the received MACDA in the frame.  If the 
   L2PE-MACDA is a Unicast MACDA then it MUST be a known MACDA.  If it 
   is unknown the frame is dropped.  Known L2PE-MACDA frames are 
 
 
Sodder                    Expires - May 2003                 [Page 11] 
Internet Draft      draft-sodder-ppvpn-vhls-01.txt       November 2002 
 
 
   forwarded based on the lookup result.  If the frame is forwarded to a 
   backbone interface it is encapsulated if required based on the 
   backbone network architecture.  If the frame is forwarded on an L2PE 
   facing interface no additional encapsulation is required. 
    
   When the received L2PE-MACDA in the frame is a broadcast MAC address 
   the PE device must replicate this frame to all L2PE devices that 
   support connectivity for the L2VPN defined in the VIC. 
    
   Frames received from backbone network interfaces should not be 
   forwarded to other backbone network interfaces.  
    
   When receiving frames the PE device will perform a lookup of the 
   L2PE-SA address and the L2VPN identifier in order to learn the source 
   interface of the frame. 
    
    
4.5 PE Frame Processing for MPLS based backbone networks 
    
   The frame format for an MPLS [MPLS-ARCH] based Service Provider 
   Backbone network is as defined in [PWE3-ENET] and is replicated below 
   for completeness. 
    
   +--------------+------------+----------------+----------------+-----+ 
   |MPLS-L2-header|PWE3-Header |L2PE-enet-header|    CE Frame    |CRC32| 
   +--------------+------------+----------------+----------------+-----+ 
    
   The format of the MPLS-L2-header [MPLS-ENCAPS] is specific to the 
   protocol used in the PE uplink. 
    
   The PWE3-Header includes a tunnel-label, an LSP label that has been 
   signaled using RSVP-TE [RSVP-MPLS-TE] or any other MPLS signaling 
   protocol in use by the service provider backbone network.  The PWE3-
   Header also includes a VC-Label that is signaled using the extensions 
   to [PWE3-CTRL] as specified earlier in this draft.  The L2PE-enet-
   header is the L2PE-MACDA, L2PE-MACSA, VET and VIC.  The information 
   field is the original CE frame. The Ethernet CRC32 added by the L2PE 
   device is replaced by the CRC32 used by the tunneling protocol. 
    
   When using MPLS for the tunneling protocol, the QOS bits in the VHLS 
   L2VPN field are mapped to and from the EXP bits in the E-LSP tunnels 
   as recommended in [MPLS-DIFFSERV]. 
    
    
   
Security Considerations 
    
   The security aspects of this model will be discussed at a later time.
