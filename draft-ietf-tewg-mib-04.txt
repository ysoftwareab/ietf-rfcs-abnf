Abstract

   This memo defines a standards-track portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   the Internet community.  In particular, it describes managed objects
   for Traffic Engineered Tunnels, for example, Multi-Protocol Label
   Switched Paths.


1. Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects for Traffic Engineered
   Tunnels, for example, Multi-Protocol Label Switched Paths ([1], [2]).
   This memo is a standards-track document.  The MIB that this memo
   defines allows one to configure TE Tunnels, assign one or more paths
   to a Tunnel, and monitor operational aspects of the Tunnel, such as
   the number of octets and packets that have passed through the Tunnel.

1.1. Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [21].

1.2. Changes from previous version

   (This section to be removed before publication.)

    o Removed Textual Conventions (now in the MPLS TC MIB)
    o Import TCs from the MPLS TC MIB
    o Added reference to MPLS TC MIB


2. The SNMP Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

      o  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [3].

      o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
         purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
         Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
         STD 16, RFC 1155 [4], STD 16, RFC 1212 [5] and RFC 1215 [6].
         The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, which
         consists of RFC 2578 [7], RFC 2579 [8] and RFC 2580 [9].

Internet Draft          A Traffic Engineering MIB             March 2003


      o  Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
         first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
         described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [10].  A second version of the
         SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
         protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [11] and
         RFC 1906 [12].  The third version of the message protocol is
         called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [12], RFC 2572 [13] and
         RFC 2574 [14].

      o  Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
         first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
         described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [10].  A second set of protocol
         operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
         [15].

      o  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [16]
         and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC
         2575 [17].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [18].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (e.g., use of Counter64).  Some machine
   readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual
   descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this
   loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the
   semantics of the MIB.

3. Overview of the MIB

   The Traffic Engineering MIB consists of four parts:
      1) Traffic Engineering information;
      2) a table of Traffic Tunnels;
      3) a table of Paths that tunnels take;
      4) a table of Hops that make up a tunnel path.

   The MIB also has statements for minimal and full compliance.

   The following subsections give an overview of each part.  All objects
   are mandatory.  For minimal compliance, all objects MAY be
   implemented read only; for full compliance, all objects must be
   implemented to their stated MAX-ACCESS capabilities.  Notifications
   are optional.

3.1. Traffic Engineering Information

   This part contains information about the Link State Protocols used to
   carry TE information, the signalling protocols used to set up Traffic
   Tunnels, the number of Traffic Tunnels that have been configured and
   that are operational, and a mapping of Administrative Group (called
   Resource Classes in [1]) numbers to names.

3.2. Traffic Tunnel Information

   This part contains a table of Traffic Tunnels and information about
   each one.  This information includes the Tunnel name, its
   configuration information, its operational information, and the
   active path(s) that the Tunnel takes.

   Configuration information includes the end points of the Traffic
   Tunnel, and the number of configured paths for the Traffic Tunnel.

   Operational information includes the current state (up/down), the
   count of octets and packets sent on the Traffic Tunnel, how long it
   has been up, and how many state transitions the Traffic Tunnel has
   had.

   Operational path information includes the number of operational
   paths, the number of path changes, and when the last path change was.

3.3. Path Information

   A Tunnel is a logical entity.  An instantiation of a Tunnel is one or
   more Paths; each Path has a route (also called Explicit Route) or
   sequence of hops.




Kompella, K.                 Standards Track                    [Page 4]

Internet Draft          A Traffic Engineering MIB             March 2003


   The configured information for a Path consists of the constraints for
   the Path and a configured route.

   The operational information consists of the Path status, as well as
   the computed route (i.e., the route that was computed to satisfy the
   constraints), and the actual path as recorded by the signaling
   protocol.

3.4. Hop Information

   A path consists of a sequence of hops; a hop can be loose (meaning
   that the path eventually traverses the specified node) or strict
   (meaning that the specified node and possibly link must be the next
   node in the path).  A hop can be specified as an IPv4 address, an
   IPv6 address, an Autonomous System number or an unnumbered interface
   index [23].

   The Hop Table contains all hops for all paths on a given router.  It
   is organized as follows.  There is a primary index that identifies a
   list of hops and a secondary index that identifies individual hops.
   Thus, to get the sequence of recorded hops for a path, one looks up
   the path's tePathRecordedRoute, which is a primary index into the Hop
   Table.  Then to get the list of actual hops in order for the recorded
   path, one uses a secondary index of 1, 2, ....

7. Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
   sensitive information.  The most important are the following tables:
   teTunnelTable, tePathTable and tePathHopTable.  It may be advisable
   to secure the teAdminGroupTable as well.

   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them
   over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features
   for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   Implementers SHOULD consider the security features as provided by the
   SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, they SHOULD consider using the User-
   based Security Model [19] and the View-based Access Control Model
   [20].

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
