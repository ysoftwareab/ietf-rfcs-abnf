<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are made largely of constrained
      nodes (with limited processing power, memory, and sometimes energy when
      they are battery operated). These routers are interconnected by lossy
      links, most of the time supporting only low data rates, that are usually
      fairly unstable with relatively low packet delivery rates. Another
      characteristic of such networks is that the traffic patterns are not
      simply unicast, but in many cases point-to-multipoint or
      multipoint-to-point. Furthermore such networks may potentially comprise
      a large number of nodes, up to several dozens or hundreds or more nodes
      in the network. These characteristics offer unique challenges to a
      routing solution: the IETF ROLL Working Group has defined
      application-specific routing requirements for a Low Power and Lossy
      Network (LLN) routing protocol. This document specifies the Routing
      Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL).

Introduction</h3>

<p>Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are made largely of constrained
      nodes (with limited processing power, memory, and sometimes energy when
      they are battery operated). These routers are interconnected by lossy
      links, most of the time supporting only low data rates, that are usually
      fairly unstable with relatively low packet delivery rates. Another
      characteristic of such networks is that the traffic patterns are not
      simply unicast, but in many cases point-to-multipoint or
      multipoint-to-point. Furthermore such networks may potentially comprise
      a large number of nodes, up to several dozens or hundreds or more nodes
      in the network. These characteristics offer unique challenges to a
      routing solution: the IETF ROLL Working Group has defined
      application-specific routing requirements for a Low Power and Lossy
      Network (LLN) routing protocol, specified in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-building-routing-reqs'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;building&#8209;routing&#8209;reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Martocci, J., Riou, N., Mil, P., and W.

<a name="rfc.section.1.1"></a><h3>1.1.&nbsp;
Design Principles</h3>

<p>RPL was designed with the objective to meet the requirements
        spelled out in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-building-routing-reqs'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;building&#8209;routing&#8209;reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Martocci, J., Riou, N., Mil, P., and W. Vermeylen, &ldquo;Building Automation Routing Requirements in Low Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-home-routing-reqs'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;home&#8209;routing&#8209;reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Brandt, A., Buron, J., and G. Porcu, &ldquo;Home Automation Routing Requirements in Low Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-indus-routing-reqs'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;indus&#8209;routing&#8209;reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Networks, D., Thubert, P., Dwars, S., and T. Phinney, &ldquo;Industrial Routing Requirements in Low Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>, and <a class='info' href='#RFC5548'>[RFC5548]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Dohler, M., Watteyne, T., Winter, T., and D. Barthel, &ldquo;Routing Requirements for Urban Low-Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>. Because those requirements are heterogeneous
        and sometimes incompatible in nature, the approach is first taken to
        design a protocol capable of supporting a core set of functionalities
        corresponding to the intersection of the requirements. (Note: it is
        intended that as this design evolves optional features may be added to
        address some application specific requirements). This is a key
        protocol design decision providing a granular approach in order to
        restrict the core of the protocol to a minimal set of functionalities,
        and to allow each instantiation of the protocol to be optimized in
        terms of required code space. It must be noted that RPL is not
        restricted to the aforementioned applications and is expected to be
        used in other environments. All "MUST" application requirements that
        cannot be satisfied by RPL will be specifically listed in the Appendix
        A, accompanied by a justification.
</p>
<p>The core set of functionalities is to be capable of operating in
        the most severely constrained environments, with minimal requirements
        for memory, energy, processing, communication, and other consumption
        of limited resources from nodes. Trade-offs inherent in the
        provisioning of protocol features will be exposed to the implementer
        in the form of configurable parameters, such that the implementer can
        further tweak and optimize the operation of RPL as appropriate to a
        specific application and implementation. Finally, RPL is designed to
        consult implementation specific policies to determine, for example,
        the evaluation of routing metrics.
</p>
<p>A set of companion documents to this specification will provide
        further guidance in the form of applicability statements specifying a
        set of operating points appropriate to the Building Automation, Home
        Automation, Industrial, and Urban application scenarios.

      terminology is extended in this document as follows:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Autonomous:</dt>
<dd>The ability of a routing protocol to
          independently function without relying on any external influence or
          guidance. Includes self-organization capabilities.
</dd>
<dt>DAG:</dt>
<dd>Directed Acyclic Graph. A directed graph having
          the property that all edges are oriented in such a way that no
          cycles exist. In the RPL context, all edges are contained in paths
          oriented toward and terminating at a root node (a DAG root, or sink-
          typically a Low Power and Lossy Network Border Router (LBR)).
</dd>
<dt>DAGID:</dt>
<dd>DAG Identifier. A globally unique identifier
          for a DAG. All nodes who are part of a given DAG have knowledge of
          the DAGID. This knowledge is used to identify peer nodes within the
          DAG in order to coordinate DAG maintenance while avoiding loops.
</dd>
<dt>DAG parent:</dt>
<dd>A parent of a node within a DAG is one of
          the immediate successors of the node on a path towards the DAG root.
          For each DAGID that a node is a member of, the node will maintain a
          set containing one or more DAG parents. If a node is a member of
          multiple DAGs then it must conceptually maintain a set of DAG
          parents for each DAGID.
</dd>
<dt>DAG sibling:</dt>
<dd>A sibling of a node within a DAG is
          defined in this specification to be any neighboring node which is
          located at the same rank (depth) within a DAG. Note that siblings
          defined in this manner do not necessarily share a common parent. For
          each DAG that a node is a member of, the node will maintain a set of
          DAG siblings. If a node is a member of multiple DAGs then it must
          conceptually maintain a set of DAG siblings for each DAG.
</dd>
<dt>DAG root:</dt>
<dd>A DAG root is a sink within the DAG. All
          paths in the DAG terminate at a DAG root, and all DAG edges
          contained in the paths terminating at a DAG root are oriented toward
          the DAG root. There must be at least one DAG root per DAG, and in
          some cases there may be more than one. In many use cases,
          source-sink represents a dominant traffic flow, where the sink is a
          DAG root or is located behind the DAG root. Maintaining routes
          towards DAG roots is therefore a prominent functionality for
          RPL.
</dd>
<dt>Grounded:</dt>
<dd>A DAG is grounded if it contains a DAG root
          offering connectivity to an external routed infrastructure such as
          the public Internet or a private core (non-LLN) IP network.
</dd>
<dt>Floating:</dt>
<dd>A DAG is floating if is not grounded. A
          floating DAG is not expected to reach any additional external routed
          infrastructure such as the public Internet or a private core
          (non-LLN) IP network.
</dd>
<dt>Inward:</dt>
<dd>Inward refers to the direction from leaf nodes
          towards DAG roots, following the orientation of the edges within the
          DAG.
</dd>
<dt>Outward:</dt>
<dd>Outward refers to the direction from DAG
          roots towards leaf nodes, going against the orientation of the edges
          within the DAG.
</dd>
<dt>P2P:</dt>
<dd>Point-to-point. This refers to traffic exchanged
          between two nodes.
</dd>
<dt>P2MP:</dt>
<dd>Point-to-Multipoint. This refers to traffic
          between one node and a set of nodes. This is similar to the P2MP
          concept in Multicast or MPLS Traffic Engineering (<a class='info' href='#RFC4461'>[RFC4461]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Yasukawa, S., &ldquo;Signaling Requirements for Point-to-Multipoint Traffic-Engineered MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs),&rdquo; April&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#RFC4875'>[RFC4875]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Aggarwal, R., Papadimitriou, D., and S.

          common RPL use case involves P2MP flows from or through a DAG root
          outward towards other nodes contained in the DAG.
</dd>
<dt>MP2P:</dt>
<dd>Multipoint-to-Point; used to describe a
          particular traffic pattern. A common RPL use case involves MP2P
          flows collecting information from many nodes in the DAG, flowing
          inwards towards DAG roots. Note that a DAG root may not be the
          ultimate destination of the information, but it is a common transit
          node.
</dd>
<dt>OCP:</dt>
<dd>Objective Code Point. In RPL, the Objective Code
          Point (OCP) indicates which routing metrics, optimization
          objectives, and related functions are in use in a DAG. Instances of
          the Objective Code Point are further described in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;routing&#8209;metrics]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vasseur, J., Kim, M., Networks, D., and H.

<p>Further, RPL is designed with consideration to the practical
          support and implementation of IPv6 architecture on devices which may
          operate under severe resource constraints, including but not limited
          to memory, processing power, energy, and communication. The RPL
          design does not presume high quality reliable links, and operates
          over lossy links (usually low bandwidth with low packet delivery
          success rate).

Typical LLN Traffic Patterns</h3>

<p>Multipoint-to-point (MP2P) and Point-to-multipoint (P2MP) traffic
          flows from nodes within the LLN from and to egress points are very
          common in LLNs. Low power and lossy network Border Router (LBR)
          nodes may typically be at the root of such flows, although such
          flows are not exclusively rooted at LBRs as determined on an
          application-specific basis. In particular, several applications such
          as building or home automation do require P2P (Point-to-Point)
          communication.
</p>
<p>As required by the aforementioned routing requirements documents,
          RPL supports the installation of multiple paths. The use of multiple
          paths include sending duplicated traffic along diverse paths, as
          well as to support advanced features such as Class of Service (CoS)
          based routing, or simple load balancing among a set of paths (which
          could be useful for the LLN to spread traffic load and avoid fast
          energy depletion on some, e.g. battery powered, nodes).

<a name="rfc.section.3.1.3"></a><h3>3.1.3.&nbsp;
Constraint Based Routing</h3>

<p>The RPL design supports constraint based routing, based on a set
          of routing metrics. The routing metrics for links and nodes with
          capabilities supported by RPL are specified in a companion document
          to this specification, <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;routing&#8209;metrics]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vasseur, J., Kim, M., Networks, D., and H. Chong, &ldquo;Routing Metrics used for Path Calculation in Low Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>. RPL signals the
          metrics and related objective functions in use in a particular
          implementation by means of an Objective Code Point (OCP). Both the
          routing metrics and the OCP help determine the construction of the
          Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) using a distributed path computation
          algorithm.
</p>
<p>RPL supports the computation and installation of different paths
          in support of and optimized for a set of application and
          implementation specific constraints, as guided by an OCP. Traffic
          may subsequently be directed along the appropriate constrained path
          based on traffic marking within the IPv6 header. For more details on
          the approach towards constraint-based routing, see <a class='info' href='#ConstrainedLLNs'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Constraint Based Routing in LLNs</span><span>)</span></a>.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2"></a><h3>3.2.&nbsp;
Protocol Operation</h3>

<p>LLN nodes running RPL will construct Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
        rooted at designated nodes that generally have some application
        significance, such as providing connectivity to an external routed
        infrastructure. The term "external" is used top refer to the public
        Internet or a core private (non-LLN) IP network. The DAG is sufficient
        to support inward MP2P traffic flows, flowing inward along the LLN
        towards a sink (DAG root), which is one of the dominant traffic flows
        described in the requirements documents (<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-building-routing-reqs'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;building&#8209;routing&#8209;reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Martocci, J., Riou, N., Mil, P., and W.

Barthel, &ldquo;Routing Requirements for Urban Low-Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>).
</p>
<p>By utilizing a DAG for dominant MP2P flows, RPL allows each node to
        select and maintain potentially multiple successors capable of
        forwarding traffic inwards towards the root. The DAG does not present
        as many single points of failure as a tree, and in addition can offer
        a node a set of pre-computed successors in support of, e.g. local
        route repair in case of a temporary failure, load balancing, or short
        term fluctuations in link characteristics.
</p>
<p>A DAG also serves to restrict the routing problem on the nodes when
        it is used as a reference topology. This allows nodes to determine
        their positions in a DAG relative to each other and provides a means
        to coordinate route repair in a way that endeavors to avoid loops.
        These mechanisms will be described in more detail later in this
        specification.
</p>
<p>As DAGs are organized, RPL will use a destination advertisement
        mechanism to build up routing tables in support of outward P2MP
        traffic flows. This mechanism, using the DAG as a reference,
        distributes routing information across intermediate nodes (between the
        DAG leaves and the root), guided along the DAG, such that the routes
        toward destination prefixes in the outward direction may be set up. As
        the DAG undergoes modification during DAG maintenance, the destination
        advertisement mechanism can be triggered to update the outward routing
        state.
</p>
<p>Arbitrary P2P traffic may flow inward along the DAG until a common
        parent is reached who has stored an entry for the destination in its
        routing table and is capable of directing the traffic outward along
        the correct outward path. In the present specification RPL does not
        specify nor preclude any additional mechanisms that may be capable to
        compute and install more optimal routes into LLN nodes in support of
        arbitrary P2P traffic according to some routing metric.

Overview of a Typical Case</h3>

<p>RPL constructs one or more DAGs, over gradients defined by
            optimizing cost metrics along paths rooted at designated
            nodes.
</p>
<p>DAGs may be grounded, in which case the DAG root (e.g. an LBR)
            is offering connectivity to an external routed infrastructure such
            as the public Internet or a private core (non-LLN) IP network. A
            typical goal for a node participating in DAG construction may be
            to find and join a grounded DAG. Any DAG which is not grounded is
            floating, and routes may still be provisioned toward the DAG root
            although with no expectations of reaching an external
            infrastructure.
</p>
<p>In the context of a particular LLN application one or more
            nodes will be capable of, e.g. serving as an LBR or acting as a
            data collection point, and thus be provisioned to act as the most
            preferred DAG roots. These nodes will initiate and continue the
            process of constructing a DAG by occasionally emitting IPv6 Router
            Advertisement (RA) messages containing the necessary information
            for neighboring nodes to evaluate the DAG root as a potential DAG
            parent. This information will include at least a DAGID, an
            administrative preference, and an Objective Code Point (OCP). The
            DAGID is an identifier unique to the DAG. The administrative
            preference offers a way to engineer the formation of the DAG in
            support of the application, by providing a mechanism by which the
            DAG may look more or less attractive for other nodes to join. The
            OCP provides information as to which metrics and optimization
            goals are being employed across the DAG.
</p>
<p>Nodes who hear RA messages, advertising a specific DAGID, will
            take into consideration several criteria when processing the
            extracted DAG information. A node may seek a DAG advertising a
            specific OCP, reflecting the implementation specific routing
            constraints understood by the node. In particular, a node will be
            seeking to find a least cost path satisfying some objective
            function as indicated by the OCP according to some routing metrics
            defined in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;routing&#8209;metrics]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vasseur, J., Kim, M., Networks, D., and H. Chong, &ldquo;Routing Metrics used for Path Calculation in Low Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>.
            For example, the least cost path may be determined in part by
            minimizing energy along a path, or latency, or avoiding the use of
            battery powered nodes. A node may be seeking to explicitly join a
            grounded DAG. Further, a node may seek the most desirable
            administrative preference when selecting a DAG, all else being
            equal. Based on the evaluation of such criteria, a node may
            determine if the node who emitted the RA message should be
            considered as a potential DAG parent. If so, then the node may add
            the advertising node to its set of candidate DAG parents for the
            advertised DAGID, and after waiting for a designated delay, the
            node may follow the procedures to activate the advertising node as
            a DAG parent and may then be considered to have joined the DAG
            designated by DAGID.
</p>
<p>When a node adds the first DAG parent to the set of DAG parents
            for a particular DAGID, the node is said to have joined, or
            attached to, the DAG designated by DAGID. Adding additional DAG
            parents beyond the first simply increases path diversity inwards
            toward the DAG root. When a node removes the last DAG parent from
            the set of DAG parents for a particular DAGID, the node is said to
            have left, or detached from, the DAG designated by DAGID. RPL will
            coordinate the joining, leaving, and movement of nodes within a
            DAGID in such a way so as to avoid the formation of loops, as
            described further below.
</p>
<p>As nodes join the DAG they are able advertise the fact by
            multicasting the DAG information in RA messages (to neighbors with
            a link-local scope). In this way, nodes are able to join the DAG
            at ever-increasing rank outward from the DAG root. As nodes
            continue to receive DAG multicasts they may continue to expand
            their set of DAG parents, while employing loop avoidance
            strategies as described below, in order to build path diversity
            inwards toward the DAG root.
</p>
<p>Using the information conveyed in the metrics of its most
            preferred DAG parent, its own metrics, and the conventions and
            functions indicated by the OCP, a node is able to compute a rank
            value within the DAG which it will use to coordinate its DAG
            maintenance.
</p>
<p>Once a preferred parent is selected, the node can compute its
            own rank in the DAG and determine alternate parents. Any node
            inwards from this node, that is with a lower rank than this node,
            can be used as an alternate parent for forwarding.
</p>
<p>In addition to identifying DAG parents, a node also may hear
            the RA messages of other neighboring nodes at the same rank within
            the DAG. In this way a node can discover DAG siblings. As it
            selects its initial position within a DAG, a node MAY increment
            its rank it order to have at least one sibling but it SHOULD NOT
            increase it as to obtain more parents.
</p>
<p>A node may order its set of DAG parents according to some
            implementation specific preference, and it SHOULD install a DAG
            parent as a default gateway. To this list the node may also append
            a similarly ordered set of DAG siblings. By forwarding traffic
            intended for the default destination towards the DAG parents, the
            node is able to support the main Multipoint-to-point (MP2P)
            traffic flows required by a typical LLN application. By using the
            ordered set of DAG parents and DAG siblings the node is able to
            take advantage of path diversity. For example, preferring to
            forward traffic towards parents guarantees to get the traffic
            inwards, closer to the DAG root, by definition, regardless of
            which parent is selected. In this example, if forwarding towards
            parents is not possible, perhaps due to a transient phenomena,
            then a node may then choose to forward traffic towards siblings,
            moving across the DAG at the same level (neither inwards or
            outwards). When receiving traffic forwarded from a sibling, the
            traffic should not be forwarded back to the same sibling in order
            to avoid a 2-node loop.
</p>
<p>By employing this procedure, the LLN is able to set up a
            path-constrained DAG, rooted at designated nodes, with other nodes
            organized along paths leading inward toward the DAG root. MP2P
            traffic intended for the destinations available to or through the
            DAG root, e.g. the default destination or other advertised
            prefixes, flows inward along the DAG towards the root, and nodes
            forwarding traffic are able to leverage the path diversity of the
            DAG as necessary.
</p>
<p>Further mechanisms described below will populate the routing
            tables along the DAG in support of P2MP and P2P traffic.

Further Operation</h3>

<p>The sub-DAG of a node is the set of other nodes of greater rank
            in the DAG that might use a path towards the DAG root that
            contains this node. Rank in the DAG is defined such that nodes
            contained in the sub-DAG of a specific node should have a greater
            rank than the node. This is an important property that is
            leveraged for loop avoidance- if a node has lesser rank then it is
            not in the sub-DAG. (An arbitrary node with greater rank may or
            may not be contained in the sub-DAG). Paths through siblings are
            not contained in this set.
</p>
<p>As a further illustration, consider the DAG examples in <a class='info' href='#Examples'>Appendix&nbsp;B<span> (</span><span class='info'>Examples</span><span>)</span></a>. Consider Node (24) in the DAG Example
            depicted in <a class='info' href='#DAGExample'>Figure&nbsp;12<span> (</span><span class='info'>Example DAG</span><span>)</span></a>. In this example,
            the sub-DAG of Node (24) is comprised of Nodes (34), (44), and
            (45).
</p>
<p>A DAG may also be floating. Floating DAGs may be encountered,
            for example, during coordinated reconfigurations of the network
            topology wherein a node and its sub-DAG breaks off the DAG,
            temporarily becomes a floating DAG, and reattaches to a grounded
            DAG at a different (more optimal) location. (Such coordination
            endeavors to avoid the construction of transient loops in the
            LLN). A DAG, or a sub-DAG, may also become floating because of a
            network element failure. Note that in the case where a floating
            DAG exists as a consequence of DAG repair, the floating DAG is
            also intended to be transient and carries a marking to make it
            less attractive. Some specific application scenarios may employ
            permanent floating DAGs, e.g. DAGs without connectivity to an
            external routed infrastructure, as a matter of normal operation.
            In such cases the floating DAG is likely to have been provisioned
            by the application with an administrative preference which will
            make it more attractive.
</p>
<p>A node will generally join at least one DAG, typically (but not
            necessarily) to or through a grounded DAG rooted at an LBR. In
            some cases, as suitable to the application scenario, a DAG may
            still provision the DAG parents as default gateways and not be
            connected to a non-LLN infrastructure such as the public Internet
            or a private IP network.
</p>
<p>This specification does not preclude a node from joining
            multiple DAGs. In one such case, a particular application may
            require the node to maintain membership in multiple DAGs in order
            to satisfy competing constraints, for example to support different
            types of traffic, similar to the concept of MTR (Multi-topology
            routing) as supported by other routing protocols such as IS-IS
            <a class='info' href='#RFC5120'>[RFC5120]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Przygienda, T., Shen, N., and N. Sheth, &ldquo;M-ISIS: Multi Topology (MT) Routing in Intermediate System to Intermediate Systems (IS-ISs),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> or OSPF <a class='info' href='#RFC4915'>[RFC4915]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Psenak, P., Mirtorabi, S., Roy, A., Nguyen, L., and P. Pillay-Esnault, &ldquo;Multi-Topology (MT) Routing in OSPF,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>, although the RPL mechanisms will
            significantly differ from the ones specified for these protocols.
            (Note that not all constrained traffic cases may require multiple
            DAGs). In support of such cases the RPL implementation must
            independently maintain requisite information and state for each
            DAG in parallel. In cases where a competing constraints must be
            satisfied toward the same DAG root, the OCP should differ by
            definition and may serve to coordinate the maintenance of the
            multiple DAGs. Further, additional recommendations for the
            operation of loop avoidance/loop detection mechanisms in the
            presence of multiple DAGs are under investigation.
</p>
<p>An administrative preference, the DAG preference, shall be
            associated with each DAG. In cases where a RPL node has a choice
            of joining more than one DAG to satisfy a particular constraint,
            and all else being equal, the node will seek to join the most
            preferred DAG as indicated by the administrative preference. In
            practice this mechanism may be assist in engineering the
            construction of a DAG as appropriate to an application. For
            example, nodes that are to become DAG roots in support of a
            particular application role, e.g. as a data sink or a controller,
            may be provisioned such that they have are more preferred. Nodes
            who are serving as the DAG root of a transient DAG, e.g. for DAG
            repair, may take on a less desirable preference value. Nodes will
            then be able to yield their transient DAGs to join the DAGs that
            are more preferred.

IP Router Advertisement - DAG Information Option (RA-DIO)</h3>

<p>The IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) mechanism (as specified in
            <a class='info' href='#RFC4861'>[RFC4861]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Narten, T., Nordmark, E., Simpson, W., and H. Soliman, &ldquo;Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6),&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>) is used by RPL in order to build
            and maintain a DAG.
</p>
<p>The IPv6 RA message is augmented with a DAG Information Option
            (DIO), forming an RA-DIO message, in order to facilitate the
            formation and maintenance of DAGs. The information conveyed in the
            RA-DIO message includes the following:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>A DAGID used to identify the DAG as sourced from the DAG
                root. Typically the (potentially compressed) IPv6 address of
                the DAG root. The DAGID must be unique to a single DAG in the
                scope of the LLN. If the DAG root is rooting multiple DAGs,
                each DAG must be provisioned with their own IPv6 address and
                thus derive unique DAGIDs.
</li>
<li>Objective Code Point (OCP) as described below.
</li>
<li>Rank information used by nodes to determine their
                relationships in the DAG relative to each other, i.e. parents,
                siblings, or children. This is not a metric, although its
                derivation is typically closely related to one or more metrics
                as specified by the OCP. The rank information is used to
                support loop avoidance strategies and in support of ordering
                alternate successors when engaged in path maintenance.
</li>
<li>Sequence number originated from the DAG root, used to aid
                in identification of dependent sub-DAGs and coordinate
                topology changes in a manner so as to avoid loops.
</li>
<li>Indications for the DAG, e.g. grounded or floating.
</li>
<li>DAG configuration parameters.
</li>
<li>A vector of path metrics. As discussed in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;routing&#8209;metrics]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vasseur, J., Kim, M., Networks, D., and H. Chong, &ldquo;Routing Metrics used for Path Calculation in Low Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> such metrics
                may be cumulative, may report a maximum, minimum, or average
                scalar value, or a link property.
</li>
<li>List of additional destination prefixes reachable via the
                DAG root.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The RA messages are issued whenever a change is detected to the
            DAG such that a node is able to determine that a region of the DAG
            has become inconsistent. As the DAG stabilizes the period at which
            RA messages occur is configured to taper off, reducing the
            steady-state overhead of DAG maintenance. The periodic issue of RA
            messages, along with the triggered RA messages in response to
            inconsistency, is one feature that enables RPL to operate in the
            presence of unreliable links.

Objective Code Point (OCP)</h3>

<p>The OCP is seeded by the DAG root and serves to convey and

            further specified in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;routing&#8209;metrics]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vasseur, J., Kim, M., Networks, D., and H.

            an allocated OCP indicates:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The set of metrics used within the DAG
</li>
<li>The objective functions used to determine the least cost
                constrained paths in order to optimize the DAG
</li>
<li>The function used to compute DAG Rank
</li>
<li>The functions used to construct derived metrics for
                propagation within a RA-DIO message
</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, an objective code point might indicate that the
            DAG is using the Expected Number of Transmissions (ETX) as a
            metric, that the optimization goal is to minimize ETX, that DAG
            Rank is equivalent to ETX, and that RA-DIO propagation entails
            adding the advertised ETX of the most preferred parent to the ETX
            of the link to the most preferred parent.
</p>
<p>By using defined OCPs that are understood by all nodes in a
            particular implementation, and by conveying them in the RA-DIO
            message, RPL nodes may work to build optimized LLN using a variety
            of application and implementation specific metrics and goals.
</p>
<p>A default OCP, OCP 0, is specified with a well-defined default
            behavior. OCP 0 is used to define RPL behaviors in the case where

Selection of Feasible DAG Parents</h3>

<p>The decision for a node to join a DAG may be optimized
            according to implementation specific policy functions on the node
            as indicated by one or more specific OCP values. For example, a
            node may be configured for one goal to optimize a bandwidth metric
            (OCP-1), and with a parallel goal to optimize for a reliability
            metric (OCP-2). Thus two DAGs, with two unique DAGIDs, may be
            constructed and maintained in the LLN: DAG-1 would be optimized
            according to OCP-1, whereas DAG-2 would be optimized according to
            OCP-2. A node may then maintain two parallel sets of DAG parents
            and related data structures. Note that in such a case traffic may
            directed along the appropriate constrained DAG based on traffic
            marking within the IPv6 header.
</p>
<p>As a node hears RA messages from its neighbors it may process
            their attached DIO messages. At this time the node may be able to
            take into consideration, for example, the following:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Is the neighboring node heard reliably enough, and are the
                metrics stable enough, that a local degree of confidence may
                be established with respect to the neighboring node? Should
                the neighboring node be considered in the set of candidate
                neighbors?
</li>
<li>In consultation with implementation specific policy (OCP
                goal), is the neighboring node a feasible parent from a
                constrained-path perspective?
</li>
<li>According to the implementation specific policy (OCP), does
                the neighboring node offer a better optimized position into
                the DAG?
</li>
<li>Does the neighboring node offer a DAG with a more desirable
                administrative preference for an otherwise currently satisfied
                optimization objective, all else being equal?
</li>
<li>Is the neighboring node a peer (sibling) within the
                DAG?
</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on such considerations, the node may incorporate the
            neighboring node into the set of DAG parents. When the node
            inserts the first DAG parent into the empty DAG parent set, it is
            able to join the DAG. As the DAG parent set is updated, the node
            will consult a rank computation function indicated by the OCP for
            the DAG in order to determine its own rank value, which it will
            subsequently advertise when it emits its own RA-DIO messages.
</p>
<p>Following is an overview of the rules used to select a parent
            (the detailed mode of operation for the selection of the candidate
            DAG parent(s) is described in <a class='info' href='#DAGDiscovery'>Section&nbsp;5.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>DAG Discovery and Maintenance</span><span>)</span></a>.
            First, it is important to note that the rank of the node is not
            directly used as a selection criteria. The metric of choice as
            indicated by the OCP advertised by the candidate parents is used
            to select the parent, although the use of a cumulative metric to
            reflect the rank is not precluded.
</p>
<p>Consider an example where a node N receives two RAs from node A
            and B with (rank, metric) equal to (2,4) and (5,3) respectively.
            Node N may chose B as its parent (higher rank but smaller metric).
            Once the parent, B, is selected, the node computes its own rank
            according to the OCP.
</p>
<p>If the node receives other RA messages it cannot attach to
            other parents if choosing that parent would cause the nodes own
            rank to increase. Back to the previous example, suppose that a
            node C appears with a (rank, metric) equal to (5,1). By selecting
            C as the new parent, N would have a rank of 6 (making the
            assumption that the rank is increased by a value of 1 according to
            the OCP). Although the path metric would be lower, this may lead
            to a DAG Loop should C belong to the sub-DAG of N as further
            discussed in <a class='info' href='#DAGRank'>Section&nbsp;3.3.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>DAG Rank and Loop Avoidance</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>All reliable neighboring nodes of a lesser rank than the node
            may be considered as potential DAG parents (Note that, as in the
            above example, as a consequence of satisfying a particular OCP
            goal, the most preferred parent may not necessarily be the
            potential parent of least rank, for example a potential parent of
            lesser rank may also be an energy constrained device that is to
            generally be avoided and thus not the most preferred). No nodes of
            greater rank than self may be in the DAG parent set; to allow such
            nodes will introduce a possibility to create loops (by potentially
            allowing a packet to make backwards progress as it is forwarded in
            the DAG). All neighboring nodes of equal rank may be considered as
            siblings within the DAG (even though they may not have parents in
            common, they may still provide path diversity towards the DAG
            root).

Example</h3>

<p>For example, suppose that a node (N) is not attached to any
              DAG, and that it is in range of nodes (A), (B), (C), (D), and
              (E). Let all nodes be configured to use an OCP which defines a
              policy such that ETX is to be minimized and paths with the
              attribute `Blue' should be avoided. Let the rank computation
              indicated by the OCP simply reflect the ETX aggregated along the
              path. Let the links between node (N) and its neighbors (A-E) all
              have an ETX of 1 (which is learned by node (N) through some
              implementation specific method). Let node (N) be configured to
              send IPv6 Router Solicitation (RS) messages to probe for nearby
              DAGs.
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Node (N) transmits a Router Solicitation.
</li>
<li>Node (B) responds. Node (N) investigates the RA-DIO
                  message, and learns that Node (B) is a member of DAGID 1 at
                  rank 4, and not `Blue'. Node (N) takes note of this, but is
                  not yet confident.
</li>
<li>Similarly, Node (N) hears from Node (A) at rank 9, Node
                  (C) at rank 5, and Node (E) at rank 4.
</li>
<li>Node (D) responds. Node (D) has a RA-DIO message that
                  indicates that it is a member of DAGID 1 at rank 2, but it
                  carries the attribute `Blue'. Node (N)'s policy function
                  rejects Node (D), and no further consideration is given.
</li>
<li>This process continues until Node (N), based on
                  implementation specific policy, builds up enough confidence
                  to trigger a decision to join DAGID 1. Let Node (N)

</li>
<li>Node (N) adds Node (E) (rank 4) to its set of DAG parents
                  for DAGID 1. Following the mechanisms specified by the OCP,
                  and given that the ETX is 1 for the link between (N) and
                  (E), Node (N) is now at rank 5 in DAGID 1.
</li>
<li>Node (N) adds Node (B) (rank 4) to its set of DAG parents
                  for DAGID 1.
</li>
<li>Node (N) is a sibling of Node (C), both are at rank
                  5.
</li>
<li>Node (N) may now forward traffic intended for the default
                  destination inward along DAGID 1 via nodes (B) and (E). In
                  some cases, e.g. if nodes (B) and (E) are tried and fail,
                  node (N) may also choose to forward traffic to its sibling
                  node (C), without making inward progress but with the
                  intention that node (C) or a following successor can make
                  inward progress. Should Node (C) not have a viable parent,
                  it should never send the packet back to Node (N) (to avoid a

DAG Maintenance</h3>

<p>When a node moves within a DAG, the move is defined as updating
            the set of DAG parents for a particular DAGID, i.e. adding or
            deleting DAG parents. Not all moves entail changes in rank.
</p>
<p>A jump from one DAG to another DAG is attaching to a new DAGID,
            in such a way that an old DAGID is replaced by the new DAGID. In
            particular, when an old DAGID is left, all associated parents are
            no longer feasible, and a new DAGID is joined.
</p>
<p>When a node in a DAG follows a DAG parent, it means that the
            DAG parent has changed its DAGID (e.g. by joining a new DAG) and
            that the node updates its own DAGID in order to keep the DAG
            parent.
</p>
<p>A frozen sub-DAG is a subset of nodes in the sub-DAG of a node
            who have been informed of a change to the node, and choose to
            follow the node in a manner consistent with the change, for
            example in preparation for a coordinated move. Nodes in the
            sub-DAG who hear of a change and have other options than to follow
            the node do not have to become part of the frozen sub-DAG, for
            example such a node may be able to remain attached to the original
            DAG through a different DAG parent. A further example may be found
            in <a class='info' href='#SectionDAGMaintenance'>Section&nbsp;3.3.1.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Example</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>When the node encounters new candidate neighbors that offer
            higher positions in the DAG, it may incorporate them directly into
            its set of DAG parents. In this case the node may update its
            choice of most preferred parent, possibly causing its own
            advertised rank to decrease, and discarding any former parents now
            of a deeper rank. This case is `moving inwards along the DAG' and
            does not require any additional coordination for loop
            avoidance.
</p>
<p>If the DAG parent set of the node becomes completely depleted,
            the node will have detached from the DAG, and may, if so
            configured, become the root of its own transient floating DAG with
            a less desirable administrative preference (thus beginning the
            process of establishing the frozen sub-DAG), and then may reattach
            to the original DAG at a lower point if it is able (after hearing
            RA-DIO messages from alternate attachment points).
</p>
<p>When the node encounters candidate parents that are in a
            different DAG, and decides to leave the current DAG in order to
            join the different DAG (thus doing a jump), it may do so safely
            without regard to loop avoidance. However, it may not return
            immediately to the current DAG as such movement may result in the
            creation of a DAG Loop, in particular if it reattaches back into
            its own former sub-DAG in an uncoordinated manner.
</p>
<p>When a node, and perhaps a related frozen sub-DAG, jumps to a
            different DAG, the move is coordinated by a DAG Hop timer. The DAG
            Hop timer allows the nodes who will attach closer to the sink of
            the new DAG to `jump' first, and then drag dependent nodes behind
            them, thus endeavoring to efficiently coordinate the attachment of
            the frozen sub-DAG into the new DAG. A further illustration of
            this mechanism may be found in <a class='info' href='#SectionDAGMerge'>Section&nbsp;3.3.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Merging DAGs</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>

Destination Advertisement</h3>

<p>As RPL constructs DAGs, nodes may provision routes toward
          destinations advertised through RA-DIO messages through their
          selected parents, and are thus able to send traffic inward along the
          DAG by forwarding to their selected parents. However, this mechanism
          alone is not sufficient to support P2MP traffic flowing outward
          along the DAG from the DAG root toward nodes. A destination
          advertisement mechanism is employed by RPL to build up routing state
          in support of these outward flows. The destination advertisement
          mechanism may not be supported in all implementations, as
          appropriate to the application requirements. A DAG root that
          supports using the destination advertisement mechanism to build up
          routing state will indicate such in the RA-DIO message. A DAG root
          that supports using the destination advertisement mechanism must be
          capable of allocating enough state to store the routing state
          received from the LLN.

Destination Advertisement Operation</h3>

<p>As the DAG is constructed and maintained, nodes are capable to
            emit NA-DAO messages to a subset, or all, of their DAG parents.
            The selection of this subset is according to an implementation
            specific policy.
</p>
<p>As a special case, a node may periodically emit a link-local
            multicast IPv6 NA-DAO message advertising its locally available
            destination prefixes. This mechanism allows for the one-hop
            neighbors of a node to learn explicitly of the prefixes on the
            node, and in some application specific scenarios this is desirable
            in support of provisioning a trivial `one-hop' route. In this
            case, nodes who receive the multicast destination advertisement
            may use it to provision the one-hop route only, and not engage in
            any additional processing (so as not to engage the mechanisms used
            by a DAG parent).
</p>
<p>When a (unicast) NA-DAO message reaches a node capable of
            storing routing state, the node extracts information from the
            NA-DAO message and updates its local database with a record of the
            NA-DAO message and who it was received from. When the node later
            propagates NA-DAO messages, it selects the best (least depth)
            information for each destination and conveys this information
            again in the form of NA-DAO messages to a subset of its own DAG
            parents. At this time the node may perform route aggregation if it
            is able, thus reducing the overall number of NA-DAO messages.
</p>
<p>When a (unicast) NA-DAO message reaches a node incapable of
            storing additional state, the node must append the next-hop
            address (from which neighbor the NA-DAO message was received) to a
            Reverse Route Stack carried within the NA-DAO message. The node
            then passes the NA-DAO message on to one or more of its DAG
            parents without storing any additional state.
</p>
<p>When a node that is capable of storing routing state encounters
            a (unicast) NA-DAO message with a Reverse Route Stack that has
            been populated, the node knows that the NA-DAO message has
            traversed a region of nodes that did not record any routing state.
            The node is able to detach and store the Reverse Route State and
            associate it with the destination described by the NA-DAO message.
            Subsequently the node may use this information to construct a
            source route in order to bridge the region of nodes that are
            unable to support Hop-By-Hop routing to reach the destination.
</p>
<p>In this way the destination advertisement mechanism is able to
            provision routing state in support of P2MP traffic flows outward
            along the DAG, and as according to the available resources in the
            network.
</p>
<p>Further aggregations of NA-DAO messages prefix reachability
            information by destinations are possible in order to support
            additional scalability.
</p>
<p>A further example of the operation of the destination
            advertisement mechanism is available in <a class='info' href='#DestinationAdvertisementExample'>Appendix&nbsp;B.6<span> (</span><span class='info'>Destination Advertisement</span><span>)</span></a>

DAG Rank and Loop Avoidance</h3>

<p>When nodes select DAG parents, they should select the most
          preferred parent according to their implementation specific
          objectives, using the cost metrics conveyed in the RA-DIO messages
          along the DAG in conjunction with the related objective functions as
          specified by the OCP.
</p>
<p>Based on this selection, the metrics conveyed by the most
          preferred DAG parent, the nodes own metrics and configuration, and a
          related function defined by the objective code point, a node will be
          able to compute a value for its rank as a consequence of selecting a
          most preferred DAG parent.
</p>
<p>It is important to note that the DAG Rank is not itself a metric,
          although its value is derived from and influenced by the use of
          metrics to select DAG parents and take up a position in the DAG. In
          other words, routing metrics and OCP (not rank directly) are used to
          determine the DAG structure and consequently the path cost. The only
          aim of the rank is to inform loop avoidance as explained hereafter.
          The computation of the DAG Rank MUST be done in such a way so as to
          maintain the following properties for any nodes M and N who are
          neighbors in the LLN:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>For a node N, and its most preferred parent M, DAGRank(N)
              &gt; DAGRank(M) must hold. Further, all parents in the DAG
              parent set must be of a rank less than self's DAGRank(N). In
              other words, the rank presented by a node N MUST be greater
              (deeper) than that presented by any of its parents. (This
              mechanism serves to avoid loops in the case where an alternate
              parent is used- if no alternate parent is deeper than the
              preferred parent then loops are avoided. The risk of loops
              occurs if there is a chance for an alternate parent to forward
              traffic to a deeper successor, which may be in the sub-DAG, and
              traffic then makes backwards progress and comes back to the node
              again).
</p>
<p>If DAGRank(M) &lt; DAGRank(N), then M is probably located in
              a more optimum position than N in the DAG with respect to the
              metrics and optimizations defined by the objective code point.
              In any fashion, Node M may safely be a DAG parent for Node N
              without risk of creating a loop. For example, a Node M of rank 3
              is located in a more optimum position than a Node N of rank 5. A
              packet directed inwards and forwarded from Node N to Node M will
              always make forward progress with respect to the DAG
              organization on that link; there is no risk of Node M at rank 3
              forwarding the packet back into Node N's sub-DAG at rank of 5 or
              greater (which would be a sufficient condition for a loop to
              occur).
</p>
<p>If DAGRank(M) == DAGRank(N), then M and N are located
              positions of relatively the same optimality within the DAG. In
              some cases, Node M may be used as a successor by Node N, but
              with related chance of creating a loop that must be detected and
              broken by some other means. If Node M is at rank 3 and node N is
              at rank 3, then they are siblings; by definition Node M and N
              cannot be in each others sub-DAG. They may then forward to each
              other failing serviceable parents, making `sideways' progress
              (but not reverse progress). If another sibling or more gets
              involved there may then be some chance for 3 or more way loops,
              which is the risk of sibling forwarding.
</p>
<p>If DAGRank(M) &gt; DAGRank(N), then node M is located in a
              less optimum position than N in the DAG with respect to the
              metrics and optimizations defined by the objective code point.
              Further, Node (M) may in fact be in Node (N)'s sub-DAG. There is
              no advantage to Node (N) selecting Node (M) as a DAG parent, and
              such a selection may create a loop. For example, if Node M is of
              rank 3 and Node N is of rank 5, then by definition Node N is in
              a less optimum position than Node N. Further, Node N at rank 5
              may in fact be in Node M's own sub-DAG, and forwarding a packet
              directed inwards towards the DAG root from M to N will result in
              backwards progress and possibly a loop.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, the DAG Rank could be computed in such a way so as
          to closely track ETX when the objective function is to minimize ETX,
          or latency when the objective function is to minimize latency, or in
          a more complicated way as appropriate to the objective code point
          being used within the DAG.
</p>
<p>The DAG rank is subsequently used to restrict the options a node
          has for movement within the DAG and to coordinate movements in order
          to avoid the creation of loops.
</p>
<p>A node may safely move `up' in the DAG, causing its DAG rank to
          decrease and moving closer to the DAG root without risking the
          formation of a loop.
</p>
<p>A node may not consider to move `down' the DAG, causing its DAG
          rank to increase and moving further from the DAG root. Such a move
          will entail moving to a less optimum position in the DAG in all
          cases, as defined by the objective code point. In the case where a
          node looses connectivity to the DAG, it must first leave the DAG
          before it may then rejoin at a deeper point. This allows for the
          node to coordinate moving down, freezing its own sub-DAG and
          poisoning stale routes to the DAG, and minimizing the chances of
          re-attaching to its own sub-DAG thinking that it has found the
          original DAG again. If a node where allowed to re-attach into its
          own sub-DAG a loop would most certainly occur, and may not be broken
          until a count-to-infinity process elapses. The procedure of
          detaching before moving down eliminates the need to
          count-to-infinity.
</p>
<p>Any neighboring nodes of lesser rank than self are eligible to be
          considered as alternate DAG parents for forwarding. But this node
          may only adopt such a parent as new preferred parent if that does
          not cause the resulting rank for this node to increase.
</p>
<p>The goal of a guaranteed consistent and loop free global routing
          solution for an LLN may not be practically achieved given the real
          behavior and volatility of the underlying metrics. The trade offs to
          achieve a stable approximation of global convergence may be too
          restrictive with respect to the need of the LLN to react quickly in
          response to the lossy environment. Globally the LLN may be able to
          achieve a weak convergence, in particular as link changes are able
          to be handled locally and result in minimal changes to global
          topology.
</p>
<p>RPL does not aim to guarantee loop free path selection, or strong
          global convergence. In order to reduce control overhead, in
          particular the expense of mechanisms such as count-to-infinity, RPL
          does try to avoid the creation of loops when undergoing topology
          changes. Further mechanisms to mitigate the impact of loops, such as
          loop detection when forwarding, are under investigation.

<p>Consider the example depicted in <a class='info' href='#DAGMaintenance'>Figure&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>DAG Maintenance</span><span>)</span></a>-1. In this example, Node (A) is
            attached to a DAG at some rank d. Node (A) is a DAG parent of
            Nodes (B) and (C). Node (C) is a DAG parent of Node (D). There is
            also an undirected sibling link between Nodes (B) and (C).
</p>
<p>In this example, Node (C) may safely forward to Node (A)
            without creating a loop. Node (C) may not safely forward to Node
            (D), contained within it's own sub-DAG, without creating a loop.
            Node (C) may forward to Node (B) in some cases, e.g. the link
            (C)-&gt;(A) is temporarily unavailable, but with some chance of
            creating a loop (e.g. if multiple nodes in a set of siblings start
            forwarding `sideways' in a cycle) and requiring the intervention
            of additional mechanisms to detect and break the loop.
</p>
<p>Consider the case where Node (C) hears a RA-DIO message from a
            Node (Z) at a lesser rank and superior position in the DAG than
            node (A). Node (C) may safely undergo the process to evict node
            (A) from its DAG parent set and attach directly to Node (Z)
            without creating a loop, because its rank will decrease.
</p>
<p>Now consider the case where the link (C)-&gt;(A) becomes
            nonviable, and node (C) must move to a deeper rank within the
            DAG:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Node (C) must first detach from the DAG by removing Node
                (A) from its DAG parent set, leaving an empty DAG parent set.
                Node (C) becomes the root of its own floating, less preferred,
                DAG.
</li>
<li>Node (D), hearing a modified RA-DIO message from Node (C),
                follows Node (C) into the floating DAG. This is depicted in

                with no other options in the sub-DAG of Node (C) will follow
                Node (C) into the floating DAG, maintaining the structure of
                the sub-DAG.
</li>
<li>Node (C) hears a RA-DIO message from Node (B) and
                determines it is able to rejoin the grounded DAG by
                reattaching at a deeper rank to Node (B). Node (C) starts a
                DAG Hop timer to coordinate this move.
</li>
<li>The timer expires and Node (C) adds Node (B) to its DAG
                parent set. Node (C) has now safely moved deeper within the
                grounded DAG without creating any loops. Node (D), and any
                other sub-DAG of Node (C), will hear the modified RA-DIO
                message sourced from Node (C) and follow Node (C) in a
                coordinated manner to reattach to the grounded DAG. The final

DAG Parent Selection, Stability, and Greediness</h3>

<p>If a node is greedy and attempts to move deeper in the DAG,
          beyond its most preferred parent, in order to increase the size of
          the DAG parent set, then an instability can result. This is
          illustrated in <a class='info' href='#Greedy'>Figure&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Greedy DAG Parent Selection</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Suppose a node is willing to receive and process a RA-DIO
          messages from a node in its own sub-DAG, and in general a node
          deeper than it. In such cases a chance exists to create a feedback
          loop, wherein two or more nodes continue to try and move in the DAG
          in order to optimize against each other. In some cases this will
          result in an instability. It is for this reason that RPL mandates
          that a node never receive and process RA-DIO messages from deeper
          nodes. This rule creates an `event horizon', whereby a node cannot
          be influenced into an instability by the action of nodes that may be
          in its own sub-DAG.

<p>Consider the example depicted in <a class='info' href='#Greedy'>Figure&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Greedy DAG Parent Selection</span><span>)</span></a>.
            A DAG is depicted in 3 different configurations. A usable link
            between (B) and (C) exists in all 3 configurations. In <a class='info' href='#Greedy'>Figure&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Greedy DAG Parent Selection</span><span>)</span></a>-1, Node (A) is a DAG parent for Nodes (B)
            and (C), and (B)--(C) is a sibling link. In <a class='info' href='#Greedy'>Figure&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Greedy DAG Parent Selection</span><span>)</span></a>-2, Node (A) is a DAG parent for Nodes (B)
            and (C), and Node (B) is also a DAG parent for Node (C). In <a class='info' href='#Greedy'>Figure&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Greedy DAG Parent Selection</span><span>)</span></a>-3, Node (A) is a DAG parent for Nodes (B)
            and (C), and Node (C) is also a DAG parent for Node (B).
</p>
<p>If a RPL node is too greedy, in that it attempts to optimize
            for an additional number of parents beyond its preferred parent,
            then an instability can result. Consider the DAG illustrated in
            <a class='info' href='#Greedy'>Figure&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Greedy DAG Parent Selection</span><span>)</span></a>-1. In this example, Nodes (B) and
            (C) may most prefer Node (A) as a DAG parent, but are operating
            under the greedy condition that will try to optimize for 2
            parents.
</p>
<p>When the preferred parent selection causes a node to have only
            one parent and no siblings, the node may decide to insert itself
            at a slightly higher rank in order to have at least one sibling
            and thus an alternate forwarding solution. This does not deprive
            other nodes of a forwarding solution and this is considered
            acceptable greediness.
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Let <a class='info' href='#Greedy'>Figure&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Greedy DAG Parent Selection</span><span>)</span></a>-1 be the initial
                condition.
</li>
<li>Suppose Node (C) first is able to leave the DAG and rejoin
                at a lower rank, taking both Nodes (A) and (B) as DAG parents
                as depicted in <a class='info' href='#Greedy'>Figure&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Greedy DAG Parent Selection</span><span>)</span></a>-2. Now Node (C)
                is deeper than both Nodes (A) and (B), and Node (C) is
                satisfied to have 2 DAG parents.
</li>
<li>Suppose Node (B), in its greediness, is willing to receive
                and process a RA-DIO message from Node (C) (against the rules
                of RPL), and then Node (B) leaves the DAG and rejoins at a
                lower rank, taking both Nodes (A) and (C) as DAG parents. Now
                Node (B) is deeper than both Nodes (A) and (C) and is
                satisfied with 2 DAG parents.
</li>
<li>Then Node (C), because it is also greedy, will leave and
                rejoin deeper, to again get 2 parents and have a lower rank
                then both of them.
</li>
<li>Next Node (B) will again leave and rejoin deeper, to again
                get 2 parents
</li>
<li>And again Node (C) leaves and rejoins deeper...
</li>
<li>The process will repeat, and the DAG will oscillate between
                <a class='info' href='#Greedy'>Figure&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Greedy DAG Parent Selection</span><span>)</span></a>-2 and <a class='info' href='#Greedy'>Figure&nbsp;2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Greedy DAG Parent Selection</span><span>)</span></a>-3 until the nodes count to infinity
                and restart the cycle again.
</li>
<li>This cycle can be averted through mechanisms in RPL: 
<ul class="text">
<li>Nodes (B) and (C) stay at a rank sufficient to attach
                    to their most preferred parent (A) and don't go for any
                    deeper (worse) alternate parents (Nodes are not
                    greedy)
</li>
<li>Nodes (B) and (C) do not process RA-DIO messages from
                    nodes deeper than themselves (because such nodes are
                    possibly in their own sub-DAGs)

<p>Consider the example depicted in <a class='info' href='#DAGMerge'>Figure&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Merging DAGs</span><span>)</span></a>. Nodes (A), (B), and (C) are part of
            some larger grounded DAG, where Node (A) is at a rank of d, Node
            (B) at d+1, and Node (C) at d+2. The DAG comprised of Nodes (D),
            (E), and (F) is a floating, less preferred, DAG, with Node (D) as
            the DAG root. This floating DAG may have been formed, for example,
            in the absence of a grounded DAG or when Node (D) had to detach
            from a grounded DAG and (E) and (F) followed. All nodes are using
            compatible objective code points.
</p>
<p>Nodes (D), (E), and (F) would rather join the more preferred
            grounded DAG if they are able than to remain in the less preferred
            floating DAG.
</p>
<p>Next, let links (C)--(D) and (A)--(E) become viable. The
            following sequence of events may then occur in a typical case:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Node (D) will receive and process a RA-DIO message from
                Node (C) on link (C)--(D). Node (D) will consider Node (C) a
                candidate neighbor and process the RA-DIO message since Node
                (C) belongs to a different DAG (different DAGID) than Node
                (D). Node (D) will note that Node (C) is in a grounded DAG at
                rank d+2, and will begin the process to join the grounded DAG
                at rank d+3. Node (D) will start a DAG Hop timer, logically
                associated with the grounded DAG at Node (C), to coordinate
                the jump. The DAG Hop timer will have a duration proportional
                to d+2.
</li>
<li>Similarly, Node (E) will receive and process a RA-DIO
                message from Node (A) on link (A)--(E). Node (E) will consider
                Node (A) a candidate neighbor, will note that Node (A) is in a
                grounded DAG at rank d, and will begin the process to join the
                grounded DAG at rank d+1. Node (E) will start a DAG Hop timer,
                logically associated with the grounded DAG at Node (A), to
                coordinate the jump. The DAG Hop timer will have a duration
                proportional to d.
</li>
<li>Node (F) takes no action, for Node (F) has observed nothing
                new to act on.
</li>
<li>Node (E)'s DAG Hop timer for the grounded DAG at Node (A)
                expires first. Node (E), upon the DAG Hop timer expiry,
                removes Node (D) as its parent, thus emptying the DAG parent
                set for the floating DAG, and leaving the floating DAG. Node
                (E) then jumps to the grounded DAG by entering Node (A) into
                the set of DAG parents for the grounded DAG. Node (E) is now
                in the grounded DAG at rank d+1. Node (E), by jumping into the
                grounded DAG, has created an inconsistency by changing its
                DAGID, and will begin to emit RA-DIO messages more
                frequently.
</li>
<li>Node (F) will receive and process a RA-DIO message from
                Node (E). Node (F) will observe that Node (E) has changed its
                DAGID and will directly follow Node (E) into the grounded DAG.
                Node (F) is now a member of the grounded DAG at rank d+2. Note
                that any additional sub-DAG of Node (E) would continue to join
                into the grounded DAG in this coordinated manner.
</li>
<li>Node (D) will receive a RA-DIO message from Node (E). Since
                Node (E) is now in a different DAG, Node (D) may process the
                RA-DIO message from Node (E). Node (D) will observe that, via
                node (E), it could attach to the grounded DAG at rank d+2.
                Node (D) will start another DAG Hop timer, logically
                associated with the grounded DAG at Node (E), with a duration
                proportional to d+1. Node (D) now is running two DAG hop
                timers, one which was started with duration proportional to
                d+1 and one proportional to d+2.
</li>
<li>Generally, Node (D) will expire the timer associated with
                the jump to the grounded DAG at node (E) first. Node (D) may
                then jump to the grounded DAG by entering Node (E) into its
                DAG parent set for the grounded DAG. Node (D) is now in the
                grounded DAG at rank d+2.
</li>
<li>In this way RPL has coordinated a merge between the more
                preferred grounded DAG and the less preferred floating DAG,
                such that the nodes within the two DAGs come together in a
                generally ordered manner, avoiding the formation of loops in
                the process.

Local and Temporary Routing Decision</h3>

<p>Although implementation specific, it is worth noting that a node
        may decide to implement some local routing decision based on some
        metrics, as observed locally or reported in the RA-DIO message. For
        example, the routing may reflect a set of successors (next-hop), along
        with various aggregated metrics used to load balance the traffic
        according to some local policy. Such decisions are local and
        implementation specific.
</p>
<p>Routing stability is crucial in a LLN: in the presence of unstable
        links, the first option consists of removing the link from the DAG and
        triggering a DAG recomputation across all of the nodes affected by the
        removed link. Such a naive approach could unavoidably lead to frequent
        and undesirable changes of the DAG, routing instability, and
        high-energy consumption. The alternative approach adopted by RPL
        relies on the ability to temporarily not use a link toward a successor
        marked as valid, with no change on the DAG structure. If the link is
        perceived as non-usable for some period of time (locally
        configurable), this triggers a DAG recomputation, through the DAG
        discovery mechanism further detailed in <a class='info' href='#DAGDiscovery'>Section&nbsp;5.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>DAG Discovery and Maintenance</span><span>)</span></a>, after reporting the link failure. Note
        that this concept may be extended to take into account other link
        characteristics: for the sake of illustration, a node may decide to
        send a fixed number of packets to a particular successor (because of
        limited buffering capability of the successor) before starting to send
        traffic to another successor.
</p>
<p>According to the local policy function, it is possible for the node
        to order the DAG parent set from `most preferred' to `least
        preferred'. By constructing such an ordered set, and by appending the
        set with siblings, the node is able to construct an ordered list of
        preferred next hops to assist in local and temporary routing
        decisions. The use of the ordered list by a forwarding engine is
        loosely constrained, and may take into account the dynamics of the
        LLN. Further, a forwarding engine implementation may decide to perform
        load balancing functions using hash-based mechanisms to avoid packet
        re-ordering. Note however, that specific details of a forwarding
        engine implementation are beyond the scope of this document.
</p>
<p>These decisions may be local and/or temporary with the objective to
        maintain the DAG shape while preserving routing stability.

Maintenance of Routing Adjacency</h3>

<p>In order to relieve the LLN of the overhead of periodic keepalives,
        RPL may employ an as-needed mechanism of NS/NA in order to verify
        routing adjacencies just prior to forwarding data. Pending the outcome
        of verifying the routing adjacency, the packet may either be forwarded
        or an alternate next-hop may be selected.

<a name="rfc.section.4.1"></a><h3>4.1.&nbsp;
Routing Metrics</h3>

<p>Routing metrics are used by the routing protocol to compute the
        shortest path according to one of more defined metrics. IGPs such as
        IS-IS (<a class='info' href='#RFC5120'>[RFC5120]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Przygienda, T., Shen, N., and N. Sheth, &ldquo;M-ISIS: Multi Topology (MT) Routing in Intermediate System to Intermediate Systems (IS-ISs),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>) and OSPF (<a class='info' href='#RFC4915'>[RFC4915]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Psenak, P., Mirtorabi, S., Roy, A., Nguyen, L., and P. Pillay-Esnault, &ldquo;Multi-Topology (MT) Routing in OSPF,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>) compute the shortest path according to a
        Link State Data Base (LSDB) using link metrics configured by the
        network administrator. Such metrics can represent the link bandwidth
        (in which case the metric is usually inversely proportional to the
        bandwidth), delay, etc. Note that in some cases the metric is a
        polynomial function of several metrics defining different link
        characteristics. The resulting shortest path cost is equal to the sum
        (or multiplication) of the link metrics along the path: such metrics
        are said to be additive or multiplicative metrics.
</p>
<p>Some routing protocols support more than one metric: in the vast
        majority of the cases, one metric is used per (sub)topology. Less
        often, a second metric may be used as a tie breaker in the presence of
        ECMP (Equal Cost Multiple Paths). The optimization of multiple metrics
        is known as an NP complete problem and is sometimes supported by some
        centralized path computation engine.
</p>
<p>In the case of RPL, it is virtually impossible to define *the*
        metric, or even a composite, that will fit it all:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Some information apply when determining routes, other
            information may apply only when forwarding packets along
            provisioned routes.
</li>
<li>Some values are aggregated hop-by-hop, others are triggers from
            L2.
</li>
<li>Some properties are very stable, others vary rapidly.
</li>
<li>Some data are useful in a given scenario and useless in
            another.
</li>
<li>Some arguments are scalar, others statistical.
</li>
</ul>

<p>For that reason, the RPL protocol core is agnostic to the logic
        that handles metrics. A node will be configured with some external
        logic to use and prioritize certain metrics for a specific scenario.
        As new heterogeneous devices are installed to support the evolution of
        a network, or as networks form in a totally ad-hoc fashion, it will
        happen that nodes that are programmed with antagonistic logics and
        conflicting or orthogonal priorities end up participating in the same
        network. It is thus recommended to use consistent parent selection
        policy, as per Objective Code Points (OCP), to ensure consistent
        optimized paths.
</p>
<p>RPL is designed to survive and still operate, though in a somewhat
        degraded fashion, when confronted to such heterogeneity. The key
        design point is that each node is solely responsible for setting the
        vector of metrics that it sources in the DAG, derived in part from the
        metrics sourced from its preferred parent. As a result, the DAG is not
        broken if another node makes its decisions in as antagonistic fashion,
        though an end-to-end path might not fully achieve any of the
        optimizations that nodes along the way expect. The default operation
        specified in OCP 0 clarifies this point.

Routing Constraints</h3>

<p>A constraint is a link or a node characteristic that must be
        satisfied by the computed path (using boolean values or lower/upper
        bounds) and is by definition neither additive nor multiplicative.
        Examples of links constraints are "available bandwidth",
        "administrative values (e.g. link coloring)", "protected versus
        non-protected links", "link quality" whereas a node constraint can be
        the level of battery power, CPU processing power, etc.

<p>The Destination Prefix suboption is used when the DAG root,

              DAG root, needs to indicate that it offers connectivity to
              destination prefixes other than the default. This may be useful
              in cases where more than one LBR is operating within the LLN and
              offering connectivity to different administrative domains, e.g.
              a home network and a utility network. In such cases, upon
              observing the Destination Prefixes offered by a particular DAG,
              a node MAY decide to join multiple DAGs in support of a
              particular application.
</p>
<p>The Length is coded as the length of the suboption in octets,
              excluding the Type and Length fields.
</p>
<p>The Prefix Length is an 8-bit unsigned integer that indicates
              the number of leading bits in the destination prefix. Prf is the
              Route Preference as in <a class='info' href='#RFC4191'>[RFC4191]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Draves, R. and D. Thaler, &ldquo;Default Router Preferences and More-Specific Routes,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>. The
              reserved fields MUST be set to zero on transmission and MUST be
              ignored on receipt.
</p>
<p>The Prefix Lifetime is a 32-bit unsigned integer representing
              the length of time in seconds (relative to the time the packet
              is sent) that the Destination Prefix is valid for route
              determination. A value of all one bits (0xFFFFFFFF) represents
              infinity. A value of all zero bits (0x00000000) indicates a loss
              of reachability.
</p>
<p>The Destination Prefix contains Prefix Length significant
              bits of the destination prefix. The remaining bits of the
              Destination Prefix, as required to complete the trailing octet,
              are set to 0.
</p>
<p>In the event that a RA-DIO message may need to specify

DAG Discovery and Maintenance</h3>

<p>DAG discovery locates the nearest sink, as determined according to
        some metrics and constraints, and forms a Directed Acyclic Graph
        towards that sink, by identifying a set of DAG parents. During this
        process DAG discovery also identifies siblings, which may be used
        later to provide additional path diversity towards the DAG root. DAG
        discovery enables nodes to implement different policies for selecting
        their DAG parents in the DAG by using implementation specific policy
        functions. DAG discovery specifies a set of rules to be followed by
        all implementations in order to ensure interoperation. DAG discovery
        also standardizes the format that is used to advertise the most common
        information that is used in order to select DAG parents.
</p>
<p>One of these information, the DAG rank, is used by DAG discovery to

DAG Discovery Rules</h3>

<p>In order to organize and maintain loopless structure, the DAG
          discovery implementation in the nodes MUST obey to the following
          rules and definitions:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>A node that does not have any DAG parents in a DAG is the
              root of its own floating DAG. It's rank is 1. A node will end up
              in that situation when it looses all of its current feasible
              parents, i.e. the set of DAG parents becomes depleted. In that
              case, the node SHOULD remember the DAGID and the sequence
              counter of the last RA-DIO message from the lost parents for a
              period of time which covers multiple RA-DIO messages. This is
              done so that if the node does encounter another possible
              attachment point to the lost DAGID within a period of time, the
              node may observe a sequence counter change by comparing the
              observed sequence counter to the last observed sequence counter
              and thus verify that the new attachment point is a viable and
              independent alternative to attach back to the lost DAGID.
</li>
<li>A node that is attached to an infrastructure that does not
              support RA-DIO messages, is the DAG root of its own grounded
              DAG. It's rank is 1. (For example an LBR that is in
              communication with a non-LLN router not running RPL).
</li>
<li>A (non-LLN) router sending a RA messages without DIO is
              considered a grounded infrastructure at rank 0. (For example, a
              router that is in communication with an LLN node but not running
              RPL such as a non-LLN public Internet router in communication
              with an LBR)
</li>
<li>The DAG root exposes the DAG in the RA-DIO message and nodes
              propagate the RA-DIO message outwards along the DAG with the RAs
              that they forward over their LLN links.
</li>
<li>A node MAY move at any time, with no delay, within its DAG
              when the move does not cause the node to increase its own DAG
              rank, as per the rank calculation indicated by the OCP.
</li>
<li>A node MUST NOT move outwards along a DAG that it is attached
              to, causing the DAG rank to increase, except in a special case
              where the node MAY choose to follow the last DAG parent in the
              set of DAG parents. In the general case, if a node is required
              to move such that it cannot stay within the DAG without a rank
              increase, then it needs to first leave the DAG. In other words a
              node that is already part of a DAG MAY move or follow a DAG
              parent at any time and with no delay in order to be closer, or
              stay as close, to the DAG root of its current DAG as it already
              is, but may not move outwards. RAs received from other routers
              located at lesser rank in the same DAG may be considered as
              coming from candidate parents. RAs received from other routers
              located at the same rank in the same DAG may be considered as
              coming from siblings. Nodes MUST ignore RAs that are received
              from other routers located at greater rank within the same
              DAG.
</li>
<li>A node may jump from its current DAG into any different DAG
              if it is preferred for reasons of connectivity, configured
              preference, free medium time, size, security, bandwidth, DAG
              rank, or whatever metrics the LLN cares to use. A node may jump
              at any time and to whatever rank it reaches in the new DAG, but
              it may have to wait for a DAG Hop timer to elapse in order to do
              so. This allows the new higher parts (closer to the sink) of the
              DAG to move first, thus allowing stepped DAG reconfigurations
              and limiting relative movements. A node SHOULD NOT join a
              previous DAG (identified by its DAGID) unless the sequence
              number in the RA-DIO message has incremented since the node left
              that DAG. A newer sequence number indicates that the candidate
              parents were not attached behind this node, as they kept getting
              subsequent RA-DIO messages with new sequence numbers from the
              same DAG. In the event that old sequence numbers (two or more
              behind the present value) are encountered they are considered
              stale and the corresponding parent SHOULD be removed from the
              set.
</li>
<li>If a node has selected a new set of DAG parents but has not
              moved yet (because it is waiting for DAG Hop timer to elapse),
              the node is unstable MUST NOT send RA-DIOs for that DAG.
</li>
<li>If a node receives a RA-DIO from one of its DAG parents, and
              if the parent contains a different DAGID, indicating that the
              parent has left the DAG, and if the node can remain in the
              current DAG through an alternate DAG parent, then the node
              SHOULD remove the DAG parent which has joined the new DAG from
              its DAG parent set and remain in the original DAG. If there is
              no alternate parent for the DAG, then the node SHOULD follow
              that parent into the new DAG.
</li>
<li>When a node detects or causes a DAG inconsistency, as
              described in <a class='info' href='#TrickleInconsistencies'>Section&nbsp;5.3.4.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Determination of Inconsistency</span><span>)</span></a>, then
              the node SHOULD send an unsolicited RA-DIO message to its
              one-hop neighbors. The RA-DIO is updated to propagate the new
              DAG information. Such an event MUST also cause the trickle timer
              governing the periodic sending of RA-DIO messages to be
              reset.
</li>
<li>If a DAG parent increases its rank such that the node rank
              would have to change, and if the node does not wish to follow
              (e.g. it has alternate options), then the DAG parent SHOULD be
              evicted from the DAG parent set. If the DAG parent is the last
              in the DAG parent set, then the node SHOULD chose to follow
              it.
</li>

Reception and Processing of RA-DIO messages</h3>

<p>When an RA-DIO message is received from a source device named
          SRC, the receiving node must first determine whether or not the

RA-DIO Transmission</h3>

<p>Each node maintains a timer that governs when to multicast RA
          messages. This timer is implemented as a trickle timer operating
          over a variable interval. Trickle timers are further detailed in
          <a class='info' href='#TrickleImplementation'>Section&nbsp;5.3.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Trickle Timer for RA Transmission</span><span>)</span></a>. The governing
          parameters for the timer should be configured consistently across
          the DAG, and are provided by the DAG root in the RA-DIO message. In
          addition to periodic RA messages, each LLN node will respond to
          Router Solicitation (RS) messages according to <a class='info' href='#RFC4861'>[RFC4861]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Narten, T., Nordmark, E., Simpson, W., and H. Soliman, &ldquo;Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6),&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>When a node is unstable, because any DAG Hop timer is running
              in preparation for a jump, then the node MUST NOT transmit
              unsolicited RA-DIOs (i.e. the node will remain silent when the
              timer expires).
</li>
<li>When a node detects an inconsistency, it SHOULD reset the
              interval of the trickle timer to a minimum value, causing RA
              messages to be emitted more frequently as part of a strategy to
              quickly correct the inconsistency. Such inconsistencies may be,
              for example, an update to a key parameter (e.g. sequence number)
              in the RA-DIO message or a loop detected when a node located
              inwards along the DAG forwards traffic outwards. Inconsistencies
              are further detailed in <a class='info' href='#TrickleInconsistencies'>Section&nbsp;5.3.4.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Determination of Inconsistency</span><span>)</span></a>.
</li>
<li>When a node enters a mode of consistent operation within a
              DAG, i.e. RA-DIO messages from its DAG parents are consistent
              and no other inconsistencies are detected, it may begin to open
              up the interval of the trickle timer towards a maximum value,
              causing RAs to be emitted less frequently, thus reducing network
              maintenance overhead and saving energy consumption (which is of
              utmost importance for battery-operated nodes).
</li>
<li>When a node is initialized, it MAY be configured to remain
              silent and not multicast any RA messages until it has
              encountered and joined a DAG (perhaps initially probing for a
              nearby DAG with an RS message). Alternately, it may choose to
              root its own floating DAG and begin multicasting RAs using a
              default trickle configuration. The second case may be
              advantageous if it is desired for independent nodes to begin
              aggregating into scattered floating DAGs in the absence of a
              grounded node, for example in support of LLN installation and
              commissioning.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that if multiple DAG roots are participating in the same
          DAG, i.e. offering RA-DIO messages with the same DAGID, then they
          must coordinate with each other to ensure that their RA-DIO messages
          are consistent when they emit RA-DIO messages. In particular the
          Sequence number must be identical from each DAG root, regardless of
          which of the multiple DAG roots issues the RA-DIO message, and
          changes to the Sequence number should be issued at the same time.
          The specific mechanism of this coordination, e.g. along a non-LLN
          network between DAG roots, is beyond the scope of this
          specification.

Resetting the Trickle Timer</h3>

<p>The trickle timer for a DAGID is reset by:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Setting I_min and I_doublings to the values learned from
                the RA-DIO message.
</li>
<li>Setting C to zero.

</li>
</ol>

<p>When an LLN learns about a DAG through a RA-DIO message and
            makes the decision to join it, it initializes the state of the
            trickle timer by resetting the trickle timer and listening. Each
            time it hears a consistent RA for this DAG from a DAG parent, it
            increments C.
</p>
<p>When the timer fires at time T, the node compares C to the
            redundancy constant, DEFAULT_DIO_REDUNDANCY_CONSTANT. If C is less
            than that value, the node generates a new RA and broadcasts it.
            When the communication interval I expires, the node doubles the
            interval I so long as it has previously doubled it fewer than
            I_doubling times, resets C, and chooses a new T value.

<li>A metric communicated in the RA-DIO message is determined

DAG Heartbeat</h3>

<p>The DAG root makes the sole determination of when to revise the
        DAGSequenceNumber by incrementing it upwards. When the
        DAGSequenceNumber is increased an inconsistency results, causing
        RA-DIO messages to be sent back outwards along the DAG to convey the
        change. The degree to which this mechanism is relied on may be
        determined by the implementation- on one hand it may serve as a
        periodic heartbeat, refreshing the DAG states, and on the other hand
        it may result in a constant steady-state control cost overhead which
        is not desirable.
</p>
<p>Some implementations may provide an administrative interface, such
        as a command line, at the DAG root whereby the DAGSequenceNumber may
        be caused to increment in response to some policy outside of the scope
        of RPL.
</p>
<p>Other implementations may make use of a periodic timer to
        automatically increment the DAGSequenceNumber, resulting in a periodic
        DAG Heartbeat at a rate appropriate to the application and
        implementation.

DAG Selection</h3>

<p>The DAG selection is implementation and algorithm dependent. Nodes
        SHOULD prefer to join DAGs advertising OCPs and destinations
        compatible with their implementation specific objectives. In order to
        limit erratic movements, and all metrics being equal, nodes SHOULD
        keep their previous selection. Also, nodes SHOULD provide a means to
        filter out a candidate parent whose availability is detected as
        fluctuating, at least when more stable choices are available. Nodes
        MAY place the failed candidate parent in a Hold Down mode that ensures
        that the candidate parent will not be reused for a given period of
        time.
</p>
<p>When connection to a fixed network is not possible or preferable
        for security or other reasons, scattered DAGs MAY aggregate as much as
        possible into larger DAGs in order to allow connectivity within the
        LLN.
</p>
<p>A node SHOULD verify that bidirectional connectivity and adequate
        link quality is available with a candidate neighbor before it
        considers that candidate as a DAG parent.

Administrative rank</h3>

<p>When the DAG is formed under a common administration, or when a

        beneficial to associate a range of acceptable rank with that node. For
        instance, a node that has limited battery should be a leaf unless
        there is no other choice, and may then augment the rank computation
        specified by the OCP in order to expose an exaggerated rank.

Candidate DAG Parent States and Stability</h3>

<p>Candidate DAG parents may or may not be eligible to act as DAG
        parents depending on runtime conditions. The following states are
        defined:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Current</dt>
<dd>This candidate parent is in the set of DAG
            parents and may be used for forwarding traffic inward along the
            DAG. When a candidate parent is placed into the Current state, or
            taken out of the Current state, it is necessary to re-evaluate
            which of the remaining DAG parents is the most preferred DAG
            parent and its rank. At that time any remaining DAG parents of
            greater rank than this node must be placed in the Held-Down state,
            and the hold-down timer started, in order to be evicted as DAG
            parents. In the same fashion, siblings must also be
            reevaluated.
</dd>
<dt>Held-Up</dt>
<dd>This parent can not be used until the DAG
            hop timer elapses.
</dd>
<dt>Held-Down</dt>
<dd>This candidate parent can not be used till
            hold down timer elapses. At the end of the hold-down period, the
            candidate is removed from the candidate DAG parent set, and may be
            reinserted if it appears again with a RA-DIO message.
</dd>
<dt>Collision</dt>
<dd>This candidate parent can not be used till
            its next RA-DIO message.

Held-Up</h3>

<p>This state is managed by the DAG Hop timer, it serves 2
          purposes:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Delay the reattachment of a sub-DAG that has been forced to
              detach. This is not as safe as the use of the sequence, but
              still covers that when a sub-DAG has detached, the RA-DIO
              message that is initiated by the new DAG root has a chance to
              spread outward along the sub-DAG, ideally forming a frozen
              sub-DAG that is aware of the DAG change, such that two different
              DAGs have formed prior to an attempted reattachment.
</p>
<p>Limit RA-DIO message storms (control cost / churn) when two
              DAGs collide/merge. The idea is that between the nodes from DAG
              A that decide to move to DAG B, those that see the highest place
              (closer to the DAG root) in DAG B will move first and advertise
              their new locations before other nodes from DAG A actually
              move.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A new DAG is discovered upon receiving a RA message with or
          without a DIO. The node joins the DAG by selecting the source of the
          RA message as a DAG parent (and possibly installing the DAG parent
          as a default gateway). The node is then a member of the DAG and may
          begin to multicast RA-DIO messages containing the DIO for the
          DAG.
</p>
<p>When a new DAG is discovered, the candidate parent that
          advertises the new DAG is placed in a held up state for the duration
          of a DAG Hop timer. If the resulting new set of DAG parents is more
          preferable than the current one, or if the node is intending to
          maintain a membership in the new DAG in addition to its current DAG,
          the node expects to jump and becomes unstable.
</p>
<p>A node that is unstable may discover other candidate parents from
          the same new DAG during the instability phase. It needs to start a
          new DAG Hop timer for all these. The first timer that elapses for a
          given new DAG clears them all for that DAG, allowing the node to
          jump to the highest position available in the new DAG.
</p>
<p>The duration of the DAG Hop timer depends on the DAG Delay of the
          new DAG and on the rank of candidate parent that triggers it:
          (candidates rank + random) * candidate's DAG_delay (where 0 &lt;=
          random &lt; 1). It is randomized in order to limit collisions and
          synchronizations.

<p>When a neighboring node is 'removed' from the Default Router

<a name="rfc.section.5.7.3"></a><h3>5.7.3.&nbsp;
Collision</h3>

<p>A race condition occurs if 2 nodes send RA-DIO messages at the
          same time and then attempt to join each other. This might happen,
          for example, between nodes which act as DAG root of their own DAGs.
          In order to detect the situation, LLN Nodes time stamp the sending
          of RA-DIO message. Any RA-DIO message received within a short
          link-layer-dependent period introduces a risk. To resolve the
          collision, a 32bits extended preference is constructed from the
          RA-DIO message by concatenating the NodePreference with the
          BootTimeRandom.
</p>
<p>A node that decides to add a candidate to its DAG parents will do
          so between (candidate rank) and (candidate rank + 1) times the
          candidate DAG Delay. But since a node is unstable as soon as it
          receives the RA-DIO message from the desired candidate, it will
          restrain from sending a RA-DIO message between the time it receives
          the RA and the time it actually jumps. So the crossing of RA may
          only happen during the propagation time between the candidate and
          the node, plus some internal queuing and processing time within each
          machine. It is expected that one DAG delay normally covers that
          interval, but ultimately it is up to the implementation and the
          configuration of the candidate parent to define the duration of risk
          window.
</p>
<p>There is risk of a collision when a node receives an RA, for
          another candidate that is more preferable than the current
          candidate, within the risk window. In the face of a potential
          collision, the node with lowest extended preference processes the
          RA-DIO message normally, while the router with the highest extended
          preference places the other in collision state, does not start the
          DAG hop timer, and does not become instable. It is expected that
          next RAs between the two will not cross anyway.
</p>
<p>For example, consider a case where two nodes are each rooting
          their own transient floating DAGs and multicast RA-DIO messages
          towards each other in a close enough interval that the RA-DIO
          messages `cross'. Then each node may receive the RA-DIO message from
          the other node, and in some scenario decide to join each others DAG.
          RPL avoids this deadlock scenario via the collision mechanism
          described above - after each node sends the RA-DIO message they will
          enter the risk window. When the peer RA-DIO message is received in
          the risk window, the nodes will calculate the extended preferences
          as describe above and the node with the lowest extended preference
          will proceed to process the RA-DIO message, while the other node
          will defer, avoiding the deadlock scenario.

<a name="rfc.section.5.7.4"></a><h3>5.7.4.&nbsp;
Instability</h3>

<p>A node is instable when it is prepared to shortly replace a set
          of DAG parents in order to jump to a different DAGID. This happens
          typically when the node has selected a more preferred candidate
          parent in a different DAG and has to wait for the DAG hop timer to
          elapse before adjusting the DAG parent set. Instability may also
          occur when the entire current DAG parent set is lost and the next
          best candidates are still held up. Instability is resolved when the
          DAG hop timer of all the candidate(s) causing instability elapse.
          Such candidates then change state to Current or Held- Down.
</p>
<p>Instability is transient (in the order of DAG hop timers). When a
          node is unstable, it MUST NOT send RAs with the DIO message. This
          avoids loops when node A decides to attach to node B and node B
          decides to attach to node A. Unless RAs cross (see Collision
          section), a node receives RA-DIO messages from stable candidate
          parents, which do not plan to attach to the node, so the node can
          safely attach to them.

Objective Function</h3>

<p>An Objective Function (OF) allows for the selection of a DAG to
          join, and a number of peers in that DAG as parents. The OF is used
          to compute an ordered list of parents and provides load balancing
          guidance. The OF is also responsible to compute the rank of the
          device within the DAG.
</p>
<p>The Objective Function is specified in the RA-DIO message using
          an objective code point (OCP) and indicates the objective function
          that has been used to compute the DAG (e.g. "minimize the path cost
          using the ETX metric and avoid `Blue' links"). The objective code
          points are specified in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-roll-routing-metrics'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;roll&#8209;routing&#8209;metrics]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vasseur, J., Kim, M., Networks, D., and H. Chong, &ldquo;Routing Metrics used for Path Calculation in Low Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>. This document specifies
          the OCP 0, in support of default operation.
</p>
<p>Most Objective Functions are expected to follow the same abstract
          behavior:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The parent selection is triggered each time an event indicates
            that a potential next_hop information is updated. This might
            happen upon the reception of a RA-DIO message, a timer elapse, or
            a trigger indicating that the state of a candidate neighbor has
            changed.
</li>
<li>An OF scans all the interfaces on the device. Although there
            may typically be only one interface in most application scenarios,
            there might be multiple of them and an interface might be
            configured to be usable or not for RPL operation. An interface can
            also be configured with a preference or dynamically learned to be
            better than another by some heuristics that might be link-layer
            dependent and are out of scope. Finally an interface might or not
            match a required criterion for an Objective Function, for instance
            a degree of security. As a result some interfaces might be
            completely excluded from the computation, while others might be
            more or less preferred.
</li>
<li>The OF scans all the candidate neighbors on the possible
            interfaces to check whether they can act as an attachment router
            for a DAG. There might be multiple of them and a candidate
            neighbor might need to pass some validation tests before it can be
            used. In particular, some link layers require experience on the
            activity with a router to enable the router as a next_hop.
</li>
<li>The OF computes self's rank by adding the step of rank to that
            candidate to the rank of that candidate. The step of rank is
            estimated as follows:
</li>
<ul class="text">
<li>The step of rank might vary from 1 to 16.
</li>
<ul class="text">
<li>1 indicates a unusually good link, for instance a link
                between powered devices in a mostly battery operated
                environment.
</li>
<li>4 indicates a `normal'/typical link, as qualified by the
                implementation.
</li>
<li>16 indicates a link that can hardly be used to forward any
                packet, for instance a radio link with quality indicator or
                expected transmission count that is close to the acceptable
                threshold.
</li>
</ul>
<li>Candidate neighbors that would cause self's rank to increase
              are ignored
</li>
</ul>
<li>Candidate neighbors that advertise an OF incompatible with the
            set of OF specified by the policy functions are ignored.
</li>
<li>As it scans all the candidate neighbors, the OF keeps the
            current best parent and compares its capabilities with the current
            candidate neighbor. The OF defines a number of tests that are
            critical to reach the Objective. A test between the routers
            determines an order relation.
</li>
<ul class="text">
<li>If the routers are roughly equal for that relation then the

</li>
<li>Some OFs may include a test to compare the ranks that would
              result if the node joined either router
</li>
</ul>
<li>When the scan is complete, the preferred parent is elected and
            self's rank is computed as the preferred parent rank plus the step
            in rank with that parent.

Establishing Routing State Outward Along the DAG</h3>

<p>The destination advertisement mechanism supports the dissemination
        of routing state required to support traffic flows outward along the
        DAG, from the DAG root toward nodes.
</p>
<p>As a result of destination advertisement operation:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>DAG discovery establishes a DAG oriented toward a DAG root
            using extended Neighbor Discovery RS/RA flows, along which inward
            routes toward the DAG root are set up.
</li>
<li>Destination advertisement extends Neighbor Discovery in order
            to establish outward routes along the DAG. Such paths consist
            of:
</li>
<ul class="text">
<li>Hop-By-Hop routing state within islands of `stateful'
              nodes.
</li>
<li>Source Routing `bridges' across nodes who do not retain
              state.
</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>Destinations disseminated with the destination advertisement
        mechanism may be prefixes, individual hosts, or multicast listeners.
        The mechanism supports nodes of varying capabilities as follows:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>When nodes are capable of storing routing state, they may
            inspect destination advertisements and learn hop-by-hop routing
            state toward destinations by populating their routing tables with
            the routes learned from nodes in their sub-DAG. In this process
            they may also learn necessary piecewise source routes to traverse
            regions of the LLN that do not maintain routing state. They may
            perform route aggregation on known destinations before emitting
            Destination Advertisements.
</li>
<li>When nodes are incapable of storing routing state, they may
            forward destination advertisements, recording the reverse route as
            the go in order to support the construction of piecewise source
            routes.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Nodes that are capable of storing routing state, and finally the
        DAG roots, are able to learn which destinations are contained in the
        sub-DAG below the node, and via which next-hop neighbors. The
        dissemination and installation of this routing state into nodes allows
        for Hop-By-Hop routing from the DAG root outwards along the DAG. The
        mechanism is further enhance by supporting the construction of source
        routes across stateless `gaps' in the DAG, where nodes are incapable
        of storing additional routing state. An adaptation of this mechanism
        allows for the implementation of loose-source routing.
</p>
<p>A special case, the reception of a destination advertisement
        addressed to a link-local multicast address, allows for a node to
        learn destinations directly available from its one-hop neighbors.
</p>
<p>A design choice behind advertising routes via destination
        advertisements is not to synchronize the parent and children databases
        along the DAG, but instead to update them regularly to recover from
        the loss of packets. The rationale for that choice is time variations
        in connectivity across unreliable links. If the topology can be
        expected to change frequently, synchronization might be an excessive
        goal in terms of exchanges and protocol complexity. The approach used
        here results in a simple protocol with no real peering. The
        destination advertisement mechanism hence provides for periodic
        updates of the routing state, as cued by occasional RAs and other
        mechanisms, similarly to other protocols such as RIP <a class='info' href='#RFC2453'>[RFC2453]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Malkin, G., &ldquo;RIP Version 2,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a>.

            include a destination advertisement option, which includes prefix
            information, in the Neighbor Advertisement (NA) messages. A prefix
            option is normally present in RA messages only, but the NA is
            augmented with this option in order to propagate destination
            information inwards along the DAG. The option is named the
            Destination Advertisement Option (DAO), and an NA message
            containing this option may be referred to as a destination
            advertisement, or NA-DAO. The RPL use of destination
            advertisements allows the nodes in the DAG to build up routing
            state for nodes contained in the sub-DAG in support of traffic
            flowing outward along the DAG.

Overview</h3>

<p>According to implementation specific policy, a subset or all of
            the feasible parents in the DAG may be selected to receive prefix
            information from the destination advertisement mechanism. This
            subset of DAG parents shall be designated the set of DA
            parents.
</p>
<p>As NA-DAO messages for particular destinations move inwards
            along the DAG, a sequence counter is used to guarantee their
            freshness. The sequence counter is incremented by the source of
            the NA-DAO message (the node that owns the prefix, or learned the
            prefix via some other means), each time it issues a NA-DAO message
            for its prefix. Nodes who receive the NA-DAO message and, if scope
            allows, will be forwarding a NA-DAO message for the unmodified
            destination inwards along the DAG, will leave the sequence number
            unchanged. Intermediate nodes will check the sequence counter
            before processing a NA-DAO message, and if the DAO is unchanged
            (the sequence counter has not changed), then the NA-DAO message
            will be discarded without additional processing. Further, if the
            NA-DAO message appears to be out of synch (the sequence counter is
            2 or more behind the present value) then the DAO state is
            considered to be stale and may be purged, and the NA-DAO message
            is discarded. A depth is also added for tracking purposes; the
            depth is incremented at each hop as the NA-DAO message is
            propagated up the DAG. Nodes who are storing routing state may use
            the depth to determine which possible next-hops for the
            destination are more optimal.
</p>
<p>If destination advertisements are activated in the RA-DIO
            message as indicated by the `D' bit, the node sends unicast
            destination advertisements to its DA parents, and only accepts
            unicast destination advertisements from any nodes but those
            contained in the DA parent subset.
</p>
<p>Every NA to a DA parent MAY contain one or more DAOs. Receiving
            a RA-DIO message with the `D' destination advertisement bit set
            from a DAG parent stimulates the sending of a delayed destination
            advertisement back, with the collection of all known prefixes
            (that is the prefixes learned via destination advertisements for
            nodes lower in the DAG, and any connected prefixes). If the
            Destination Advertisement Supported (A) bit is set in the RA-DIO
            message for the DAG, then a destination advertisement is also sent
            to a DAG parent once it has been added to the DA parent set after
            a movement, or when the list of advertised prefixes has changed.
            Destination advertisements may also be scheduled for sending when
            the PathDigest of the RA-DIO message has changed, indicating that
            some aspect of the inwards paths along the DAG has been
            modified.
</p>
<p>Destination advertisements may advertise positive (prefix is
            present) or negative (removed) NA-DAO messages, termed as no-DAOs.
            A no-DAO is stimulated by the disappearance of a prefix below.
            This is discovered by timing out after a request (a RA-DIO
            message) or by receiving a no-DAO. A no-DAO is a conveyed as a
            NA-DAO message with a DAO Lifetime of 0.
</p>
<p>A node who is capable of recording the state information
            conveyed in a unicast NA-DAO message will do so upon receiving and
            processing the NA-DAO message, thus building up routing state
            concerning destinations below it in the DAG. If a node capable of
            recording state information receives a NA-DAO message containing a
            Reverse Route Stack, then the node knows that the NA-DAO message
            has traversed one or more nodes that did not retain any routing
            state as it traversed the path from the DAO source to the node.
            The node may then extract the Reverse Route Stack and retain the
            included state in order to specify Source Routing instructions
            along the return path towards the destination. The node MUST set
            the RRCount back to zero and clear the Reverse Route Stack prior
            to passing the NA-DAO message information on.
</p>
<p>A node who is unable to record the state information conveyed
            in the NA-DAO message will append the next-hop address to the
            Reverse Route Stack, increment the RRCount, and then pass the
            destination advertisement on without recording any additional
            state. In this way the Reverse Route Stack will contain a vector
            of next hops that must be traversed along the reverse path that
            the NA-DAO message has traveled. The vector will be ordered such
            that the node closest to the destination will appear first in the
            list. In such cases, if it is useful to the implementation to try
            and build up redundant paths, the node may choose to convey the
            destination advertisement to one or more DAG parents in order of
            preference as guided by an implementation specific policy.
</p>
<p>In some cases (called hybrid cases), some nodes along the path
            a destination advertisement follows inward along the DAG may store
            state and some may not. The destination advertisement mechanism
            allows for the provisioning of routing state such that when a
            packet is traversing outwards along the DAG, some nodes may be
            able to directly forward to the next hop, and other nodes may be
            able to specify a piecewise source route in order to bridge spans
            of stateless nodes within the path on the way to the desired
            destination.
</p>
<p>In the case where no node is able to store any routing state as
            destination advertisements pass by, and the DAG root ends up with
            NA-DAO messages that contain a completely specified route back to
            the originating node in the form of the inverted Reverse Route
            Stack. A DAG root should not request (Destination Advertisement
            Trigger) nor indicate support (Destination Advertisement
            Supported) for destination advertisements if it is not able to
            store the Reverse Route Stack information in this case.
</p>
<p>The destination advertisement mechanism requires stateful nodes
            to maintain lists of known prefixes. A prefix entry contains the
            following abstract information:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>A reference to the ND entry that was created for the
                advertising neighbor.
</li>
<li>The IPv6 address and interface for the advertising
                neighbor.
</li>
<li>The logical equivalent of the full destination
                advertisement information (including the prefixes, depth, and
                Reverse Route Stack, if any).
</li>
<li>A 'reported' Boolean to keep track whether this prefix was
                reported already, and to which of the DA parents.
</li>
<li>A counter of retries to count how many RA-DIO messages were
                sent on the interface to the advertising neighbor without
                reachability confirmation for the prefix.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that nodes may receive multiple information from different
            neighbors for a specific destination, as different paths through
            the DAG may be propagating information inwards along the DAG for
            the same destination. A node who is recording routing state will
            keep track of the information from each neighbor independently,
            and when it comes time to propagate the NA-DAO message for a
            particular prefix to the DA parents, then the DAO information will
            be selected from among the advertising neighbors who offer the
            least depth to the destination.
</p>
<p>The destination advertisement mechanism stores the prefix
            entries in one of 3 abstract lists; the Connected, the Reachable
            and the Unreachable lists.
</p>
<p>The Connected list corresponds to the prefixes owned and
            managed by the local node.
</p>
<p>The Reachable list contains prefixes for which the node keeps
            receiving NA-DAO messages, and for those prefixes which have not
            yet timed out.
</p>
<p>The Unreachable list keeps track of prefixes which are no
            longer valid and in the process of being deleted, in order to send
            NA-DAO messages with zero lifetime (also called no-DAO) to the DA
            parents.

Destination Advertisement Timers</h3>

<p>The destination advertisement mechanism requires 2 timers;
              the DelayNA timer and the RemoveTimer.
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The DelayNA timer is armed upon a stimulation to send a
                  destination advertisement (such as a RA-DIO message from a
                  DA parent). When the timer is armed, all entries in the
                  Reachable list as well as all entries for Connected list are
                  set to not be reported yet for that particular DA
                  parent.
</li>
<li>The DelayNA timer has a duration that is DEF_NA_LATENCY
                  divided by a multiple of the DAG rank of the node. The
                  intention is that nodes located deeper in the DAG should
                  have a shorter DelayNA timer, allowing NA-DAO messages a
                  chance to be reported from deeper in the DAG and potentially
                  aggregated along sub-DAGs before propagating further
                  inwards.
</li>
<li>The RemoveTimer is used to clean up entries for which
                  NA-DAO messages are no longer being received from the
                  sub-DAG.
</li>
<ul class="text">
<li>When a RA-DIO message is sent that is requesting
                    destination advertisements, a flag is set for all DAO
                    entries in the routing table.
</li>
<li>If the flag has already been set for a DAO entry, the
                    retry count is incremented.
</li>
<li>If a NA-DAO message is received to confirm the entry,
                    the entry is refreshed and the flag and count may be
                    cleared.
</li>
<li>If at least one entry has reached a threshold value and
                    the RemoveTimer is not running, the entry is considered to
                    be probably gone and the RemoveTimer is started.
</li>
<li>When the RemoveTimer elapse, NA-DAO messages with
                    lifetime 0, i.e. no-DAOs, are sent to explicitly inform DA
                    parents that the entries who have reached the threshold
                    are no longer available, and the related routing states
                    may be propagated and cleaned up.
</li>
</ul>
<li>The RemoveTimer has a duration of min
                  (MAX_DESTROY_INTERVAL, RA_INTERVAL).

Multicast Destination Advertisement messages</h3>

<p>It is also possible for a node to multicast a NA-DAO message to
            the link-local scope all-nodes multicast address FF02::1. This
            message will be received by all node listening in range of the
            emitting node. The objective is to enable direct P2P
            communication, between destinations directly supported by
            neighboring nodes, without needing the RPL routing structure to
            relay the packets.
</p>
<p>A multicast NA-DAO message MUST be used only to advertise
            information about self, i.e. prefixes in the Connected list or
            addresses owned by this node. This would typically be a multicast
            group that this node is listening to or a global address owned by
            this node, though it can be used to advertise any prefix owned by
            this node as well. A multicast NA-DAO message is not used for
            routing and does not presume any DAG relationship between the
            emitter and the receiver; it MUST NOT be used to relay information
            learned (e.g. information in the Reachable list) from another
            node; information obtained from a multicast NA-DAO MAY be
            installed in the routing table and MAY be propagated by a router
            in unicast NA-DAOs.
</p>
<p>A node receiving a multicast NA-DAO message addressed to
            FF02::1 MAY install prefixes contained in the NA-DAO message in
            the routing table for local use. Such a node MUST NOT perform any
            other processing on the NA-DAO message (i.e. such a node does not
            presume it is a DA parent).

Unicast Destination Advertisement messages from child to parent</h3>

<p>When sending a destination advertisement to a DA parent, a node
            includes the DAOs for prefix entries not already reported (since
            the last DA Trigger from an RA-DIO message) in the Reachable and
            Connected lists, as well as no-DAOs for all the entries in the
            Unreachable list. Depending on its policy and ability to retain
            routing state, the receiving node SHOULD keep a record of the
            reported NA-DAO message. If the NA-DAO message offers the best
            route to the prefix as determined by policy and other prefix
            records, the node SHOULD install a route to the prefix reported in
            the NA-DAO message via the link local address of the reporting
            neighbor and it SHOULD further propagate the information in a
            NA-DAO message.
</p>
<p>The RA-DIO message from the DAG root is used to synchronize the
            whole DAG, including the periodic reporting of destination
            advertisements back up the DAG. Its period is expected to vary,
            depending on the configuration of the trickle timer that governs
            the RAs.
</p>
<p>When a node receives a RA-DIO message over an LLN interface
            from a DA parent, the DelayNA is armed to force a full update.
</p>
<p>When the node broadcasts a RA-DIO message on an LLN interface,
            for all entries on that interface:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>If the entry is CONFIRMED, it goes PENDING with the retry
                count set to 0.
</li>
<li>If the entry is PENDING, the retry count is incremented. If
                it reaches a maximum threshold, the entry goes ELAPSED If at
                least one entry is ELAPSED at the end of the process: if the
                Destroy timer is not running then it is armed with a
                jitter.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Since the DelayNA timer has a duration that decreases with the
            depth, it is expected to receive all NA-DAO messages from all
            children before the timer elapses and the full update is sent to
            the DA parents.
</p>
<p>Once the RemoveTimer is elapsed, the prefix entry is scheduled
            to be removed and moved to the Unreachable list if there are any
            DA parents that need to be informed of the change in status for
            the prefix, otherwise the prefix entry is cleaned up right away.
            The prefix entry is removed from the Unreachable list when no more
            DA parents need to be informed. This condition may be satisfied
            when a no-DAO is sent to all current DA parents indicating the
            loss of the prefix, and noting that in some cases parents may have
            been removed from the set of DA parents.

Aggregation of prefixes by a node</h3>

<p>There may be number of cases where a aggregation may be shared
            within a group of nodes. In such a case, it is possible to use
            aggregation techniques with destination advertisements and improve
            scalability.
</p>
<p>Other cases might occur for which additional support is
            required:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>The aggregating node is attached within the sub-DAG of the
                nodes it is aggregating for.
</li>
<li>A node that is to be aggregated for is located somewhere
                else within the DAG, not in the sub-DAG of the aggregating
                node.
</li>
<li>A node that is to be aggregated for is located somewhere
                else in the LLN.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Consider a node M who is performing an aggregation, and a node
            N who is to be a member of the aggregation group. A node Z
            situated above the node M in the DAG, but not above node N, will
            see the advertisements for the aggregation owned by M but not that
            of the individual prefix for N. Such a node Z will route all the
            packets for node N towards node M, but node M will have no route
            to the node N and will fail to forward.
</p>
<p>Additional protocols may be applied beyond the scope of this
            specification to dynamically elect/provision an aggregating node
            and groups of nodes eligible to be aggregated in order to provide
            route summarization for a sub-DAG.

Multicast Operation</h3>

<p>This section describes further the multicast routing operations
        over an IPv6 RPL network, and specifically how unicast NA-DAOs can be
        used to relay group registrations inwards. Wherever the following text
        mentions MLD, one can read MLDv2 or v3.
</p>
<p>As is traditional, a listener uses a protocol such as MLD with a
        router to register to a multicast group.
</p>
<p>Along the path between the router and the root of the DAG, MLD
        requests are mapped and transported as NA-DAO messages within the RPL
        protocol; each hop coalesces the multiple requests for a same group as
        a single NA-DAO message to the parent(s), in a fashion similar to
        proxy IGMP, but recursively between child router and parent up to the
        root.
</p>
<p>A router might select to pass a listener registration NA-DAO
        message to its preferred parent only, in which case multicast packets
        coming back might be lost for all of its sub-DAG if the transmission
        fails over that link. Alternatively the router might select to copy
        additional parents as it would do for NA-DAO messages advertising
        unicast destinations, in which case there might be duplicates that the
        router will need to prune.
</p>
<p>As a result, multicast routing states are installed in each router
        on the way from the listeners to the root, enabling the root to copy a
        multicast packet to all its children routers that had issued a NA-DAO
        message including a DAO for that multicast group, as well as all the
        attached nodes that registered over MLD.
</p>
<p>For unicast traffic, it is expected that the grounded root of an
        RPL DAG terminates RPL and MAY redistribute the RPL routes over the
        external infrastructure using whatever routing protocol is used there.
        For multicast traffic, the root MAY proxy MLD for all the nodes
        attached to the RPL routers (this would be needed if the multicast
        source is located in the external infrastructure). For such a source,
        the packet will be replicated as it flows outwards along the DAG based
        on the multicast routing table entries installed from the NA-DAO
        message.
</p>
<p>For a source inside the DAG, the packet is passed to the preferred
        parents, and if that fails then to the alternates in the DAG. The
        packet is also copied to all the registered children, except for the
        one that passed the packet. Finally, if there is a listener in the
        external infrastructure then the DAG root has to further propagate the
        packet into the external infrastructure.
</p>
<p>As a result, the DAG Root acts as an automatic proxy Rendez-vous
        Point for the RPL network, and as source towards the Internet for all
        multicast flows started in the RPL LLN. So regardless of whether the
        root is actually attached to the Internet, and regardless of whether
        the DAG is grounded or floating, the root can serve inner multicast
        streams at all times.

Maintenance of Routing Adjacency</h3>

<p>The selection of successors, along the default paths inward along
        the DAG, or along the paths learned from destination advertisements
        outward along the DAG, leads to the formation of routing adjacencies
        that require maintenance.
</p>
<p>In IGPs such as OSPF <a class='info' href='#RFC4915'>[RFC4915]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Psenak, P., Mirtorabi, S., Roy, A., Nguyen, L., and P.

Sheth, &ldquo;M-ISIS: Multi Topology (MT) Routing in Intermediate System to Intermediate Systems (IS-ISs),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>, the maintenance of a routing adjacency
        involves the use of Keepalive mechanisms (Hellos) or other protocols
        such as BFD (<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-bfd-base'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;bfd&#8209;base]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Katz, D. and D. Ward, &ldquo;Bidirectional Forwarding Detection,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>) and MANET
        Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-manet-nhdp'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;manet&#8209;nhdp]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Clausen, T., Dearlove, C., and J. Dean, &ldquo;MANET Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP),&rdquo; July&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>). Unfortunately, such an approach
        is not desirable in constrained environments such as LLN and would
        lead to excessive control traffic in light of the data traffic with a
        negative impact on both link loads and nodes resources. Overhead to
        maintain the routing adjacency should be minimized. Furthermore, it is
        not always possible to rely on the link or transport layer to provide
        information of the associated link state. The network layer needs to
        fall back on its own mechanism.
</p>
<p>Thus RPL makes use of a different approach consisting of probing
        the neighbor using a Neighbor Solicitation message (see <a class='info' href='#RFC4861'>[RFC4861]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Narten, T., Nordmark, E., Simpson, W., and H. Soliman, &ldquo;Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6),&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>). The reception of a Neighbor Advertisement
        (NA) message with the "Solicited Flag" set is used to verify the
        validity of the routing adjacency. Such mechanism MAY be used prior to
        sending a data packet. This allows for detecting whether or not the
        routing adjacency is still valid, and should it not be the case,
        select another feasible successor to forward the packet.

Packet Forwarding</h3>

<p>When forwarding a packet to a destination, precedence is given to
        selection of a next-hop successor as follows:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>It is preferred to select a successor from a DAG who is
            supporting an OCP and related optimization that maps to an
            objective marked in the IPv6 header of the packet being
            forwarded.
</li>
<li>If a local administrative preference favors a route that has
            been learned from a different routing protocol than RPL, then use
            that successor.
</li>
<li>If there is an entry in the routing table matching the
            destination that has been learned from a multicast destination
            advertisement (e.g. the destination is a one-hop neighbor), then
            use that successor.
</li>
<li>If there is an entry in the routing table matching the
            destination that has been learned from a unicast destination
            advertisement (e.g. the destination is located outwards along the
            sub-DAG), then use that successor.
</li>
<li>If there is a DAG offering a route to a prefix matching the
            destination, then select one of those DAG parents as a
            successor.
</li>
<li>If there is a DAG offering a default route with a compatible
            OCP, then select one of those DAG parents as a successor.
</li>
<li>If there is a DAG offering a route to a prefix matching the
            destination, but all DAG parents have been tried and are
            temporarily unavailable (as determined by the forwarding
            procedure), then select a DAG sibling as a successor.
</li>
<li>Finally, if no DAG siblings are available, the packet is
            dropped. ICMP Destination Unreachable may be invoked. An
            inconsistency is detected.
</li>
</ol>

<p>TTL MUST be decremented when forwarding. If the packet is being
        forwarded via a sibling, then the TTL MAY be decremented more
        aggressively (by more than one) to limit the impact of possible
        loops.
</p>
<p>Note that the chosen successor MUST NOT be the neighbor who was the
        predecessor of the packet (split horizon), except in the case where it
        is intended for the packet to change from an inward to an outward
        flow, such as switching from DIO routes to DAO routes as the
        destination is neared.

DAG Loops</h3>

<p>A DAG loop may occur when a node detaches from the DAG and
            reattaches to a device in its prior sub-DAG that has missed the
            whole detachment sequence and kept advertising the original DAG.
            This may happen in particular when RA-DIO messages are missed. Use
            of the DAG sequence number can eliminate this type of loop. If the
            DAG sequence number is not in use, the protection is limited (it
            depends on propagation of RA-DIO messages during DAG hop timer),
            and temporary loops might occur. RPL will move to eliminate such a
            loop as soon as a RA-DIO message is received from a parent that
            appears to be going down, as the child has to detach from it
            immediately. (The alternate choice of staying attached and
            following the parent in its fall would have counted to infinity
            and led to detach as well).
</p>
<p>Consider node (24) in the DAG Example depicted in <a class='info' href='#DAGExample'>Figure&nbsp;12<span> (</span><span class='info'>Example DAG</span><span>)</span></a>, and its sub-DAG nodes (34), (44), and
            (45). An example of a DAG loop would be if node (24) were to
            detach from the DAG rooted at (LBR), and nodes (34) and (45) were
            to miss the detachment sequence. Subsequently, if the link

DAO Loops</h3>

<p>A DAO loop may occur when the parent has a route installed upon
            receiving and processing a NA-DAO message from a child, but the
            child has subsequently cleaned up the state. This loop happens
            when a no-DAO was missed till a heartbeat cleans up all states.
            The DAO loop is not explicitly handled by the current
            specification. Split horizon, not forwarding a packet back to the
            node it came from, may mitigate the DAO loop in some cases, but
            does not eliminate it.
</p>
<p>Consider node (24) in the DAG Example depicted in <a class='info' href='#DAGExample'>Figure&nbsp;12<span> (</span><span class='info'>Example DAG</span><span>)</span></a>. Suppose node (24) has received a DA
            from node (34) advertising a destination at node (45).
            Subsequently, if node (34) tears down the routing state for the
            destination and node (24) did not hear a no-DAO message to clean
            up the routing state, a DAO loop may exist. node (24) will forward
            traffic destined for node (45) to node (34), who may then naively
            return it into a loop (if split horizon is not in place). A more
            complicated DAO loop may result if node (34) instead passes the
            traffic to it's sibling, node (33), potentially resulting in a
            (24-&gt;34-&gt;33-&gt;23-&gt;13-&gt;24) loop.

Sibling Loops</h3>

<p>Sibling loops occur when a group of siblings keep choosing
            amongst themselves as successors such that a packet does not make
            forward progress. The current draft limits those loops to some
            degree by split horizon (do not send back to the same sibling) and
            parent preference (always prefer parents vs. siblings).
</p>
<p>Consider the DAG Example depicted in <a class='info' href='#DAGExample'>Figure&nbsp;12<span> (</span><span class='info'>Example DAG</span><span>)</span></a>. Suppose that Node (32) and (34) are
            reliable neighbors, and thus are siblings. Then, in the case where
            Nodes (22), (23), and (24) are transiently unavailable, and with
            no other guiding strategy, a sibling loop may exist, e.g.
            (33-&gt;34-&gt;32-&gt;33) as the siblings keep choosing amongst
            each other in an uncoordinated manner.

          configuration of the following trickle parameters:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The DIOIntervalMin expressed in ms
</li>
<li>The DIOIntervalDoublings
</li>
</ul>

<p>A RPL implementation MAY provide a counter reporting the number
          of times an inconsistency (and thus the trickle timer has been
          reset).

<p>Consider the example LLN physical topology in <a class='info' href='#LLNExample'>Figure&nbsp;11<span> (</span><span class='info'>Example LLN Topology</span><span>)</span></a>. In this example the links depicted are all
      usable L2 links. Suppose that all links are equally usable, and that the
      implementation specific policy function is simply to minimize hops. This
      LLN physical topology then yields the DAG depicted in <a class='info' href='#DAGExample'>Figure&nbsp;12<span> (</span><span class='info'>Example DAG</span><span>)</span></a>, where the links depicted are the edges
      toward DAG parents. This topology includes one DAG, rooted by an LBR
      node (LBR) at rank 1. The LBR node will issue RAs containing DIO, as
      governed by a trickle timer. Nodes (11), (12), (13), have selected (LBR)

Moving Down a DAG</h3>

<p>Consider node (56) in the example of <a class='info' href='#LLNExample'>Figure&nbsp;11<span> (</span><span class='info'>Example LLN Topology</span><span>)</span></a>. In the unmodified example, node (56) is
        at rank 6 with one DAG parent, {(43)}, and one sibling (55). Suppose,
        for example, that node (56) wished to expand its DAG parent set to
        contain node (55), as {(43), (55)}. Such a change would require node
        (56) to detach from the DAG, to defer reattachment until a loop
        avoidance algorithm has completed, and to then reattach to the DAG
        with {(43), (55)} as it's DAG parents. When node (56) detaches from
        the DAG, it is able to act as the root of its own floating DAG and
        establish its frozen sub-DAG (which is empty). Node (56) can then
        observe that Node (55) is still attached to the original DAG, that its
        sequence number is able to increment, and deduce that Node (55) is
        safely not behind Node (56). There is then little change for a loop,
        and Node (56) may safely reattach to the DAG, with parents {(43),
        (55)}. At reattachment time, node (56) would present itself with a
        rank deeper than that of its deepest DAG parent (node (55) at rank 6),
        rank 7.

Additional Support for P2P Routing</h3>

<p>In some situations the baseline mechanism to support arbitrary P2P
        traffic, by flowing inward along the DAG until a common parent is
        reached and then flowing outward, may not be suitable for all
        application scenarios. A related scenario may occur when the outward
        paths setup along the DAG by the destination advertisement mechanism
        are not be the most desirable outward paths for the specific
        application scenario (in part because the DAG links may not be
        symmetric). It may be desired to support within RPL the discovery and
        installation of more direct routes `across' the DAG. Such mechanisms
        need to be investigated.

Loop Detection</h3>

Destination Advertisement / DAO Fan-out</h3>

<p>When NA-DAO messages are relayed to more than one DAG parent, in
        some cases a situation may be created where a large number of NA-DAO
        messages conveying information about the same destination flow inward
        along the DAG. It is desirable to bound/limit the
        multiplication/fan-out of NA-DAO messages in this manner. Some aspects
        of the Destination Advertisement mechanism remain under investigation,
        such as behavior in the face of links that may not be symmetric.

Source Routing</h3>

<p>In support of nodes who maintain minimal routing state, and to make
        use of the collection of piecewise source routes from the destination
        advertisement mechanism, there needs to be some investigation of a
        mechanism to specify, attach, and follow source routes for packets
        traversing the LLN.

Address / Header Compression</h3>

<p>In order to minimize overhead within the LLN it is desirable to
        perform some sort of address and/or header compression, perhaps via
        labels, addresses aggregation, or some other means. This is still
        under investigation.
