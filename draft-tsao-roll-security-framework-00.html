<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>This document presents a security framework for routing over low
      power and lossy networks. The development of the framework builds upon
      previous work on routing security and adapts the security assessments to
      the issues and constraints specific to low power and lossy networks. A
      systematic approach is used in defining and assessing the security
      threats and identifying applicable countermeasures. These assessments
      provide the basis of the security recommendations for incorporation into
      low power, lossy network routing protocols.

Introduction</h3>

<p>In recent times, networked wireless devices have found an increasing
      number of applications in various fields. Yet, for reasons ranging from
      operational application to economics, these wireless devices are often
      supplied with minimum physical resources, e.g., limited power reserve,
      slow speed or low capability computation, or small memory size. As a
      consequence, the resulting networks are more prone to loss of traffic
      and other vulnerabilities. The proliferation of these low power and
      lossy networks (LLNs), however, are drawing efforts to examine and
      address their potential networking challenges.
</p>
<p>This document presents a framework for securing routing over low
      power and lossy networks (ROLL) through an analysis that starts from the
      routing basics. The objective is two-fold. First, the framework will be
      used to identify pertinent security issues. Second, it will facilitate
      both the assessment of a protocol's security threats and the
      identification of the necessary features for development of secure
      protocols for ROLL.
</p>
<p>The approach adopted in this effort proceeds in four steps, to
      examine ROLL security issues, to analyze threats and attacks, to
      consider the countermeasures, and then to make recommendations for
      securing ROLL. The basis is found on identifying the assets and points
      of access of routing and evaluating their security needs based on the
      Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) model in the context
      of LLN.

Considerations on ROLL Security</h3>

<p>This section sets the stage for the development of the framework by
      applying the systematic approach proposed in <a class='info' href='#Myagmar2005'>[Myagmar2005]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Myagmar, S., Lee, AJ., and W. Yurcik, &ldquo;Threat Modeling as a Basis for Security Requirements,&rdquo; Aug 29,&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> to the routing security problem, while also
      drawing references from other reviews and assessments found in the
      literature, particularly, <a class='info' href='#RFC4593'>[RFC4593]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Barbir, A., Murphy, S., and Y. Yang, &ldquo;Generic Threats to Routing Protocols,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#Karlof2003'>[Karlof2003]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Karlof, C. and D. Wagner, &ldquo;Secure routing in wireless sensor networks: attacks and           countermeasures,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>. The subsequent subsections begin with a
      focus on the elements of a generic routing process that is used to
      establish routing assets and points of access of the routing
      functionality. Next, the CIA security model is briefly described. Then,
      consideration is given to issues specific to or magnified in LLNs.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1"></a><h3>3.1.&nbsp;
Routing Assets and Points of Access</h3>

<p>An asset implies important system component (including information,
        process, or physical resource), the access to, corruption or loss of
        which adversely affects the system. In network routing, assets lie in
        the routing information, routing process, and node's physical
        resources. That is, the access to, corruption, or loss of these
        elements adversely affects system routing. In network routing, a point
        of access refers to the point of entry facilitating communication with
        or other interaction with a system component in order to use system
        resources to either manipulate information or gain knowledge of the
        information contained within the system. Security of the routing
        protocol must be focused on the assets of the routing nodes and the
        points of access of the information exchanges and information storage
        that may permit routing compromise. The identification of routing
        assets and points of access hence provides a basis for the
        identification of associated threats and attacks.
</p>
<p>This subsection identifies assets and points of access of a generic
        routing process with a level-0 data flow diagram. The use of the data
        flow diagram allows for a clear, concise model of the routing
        functionality; it also has the benefit of showing the manner in which
        nodes participate in the routing process, thus providing context when
        later threats and attacks are considered. The goal of the model is to
        be as detailed as possible so that corresponding components and
        mechanisms in an individual routing protocol can be readily
        identified, but also to be as general as possible to maximize the
        relevancy of this effort for the various existing and future
        protocols. Nevertheless, there may be discrepancies, likely in the
        form of additional elements, when the model is applied to some
        protocols. For such cases, the analysis approach laid out in this
        document should still provide a valid and illustrative path for their
        security assessment.
</p>
<p><a class='info' href='#Fig1'>Figure&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Data Flow Diagram of a Generic Routing Process</span><span>)</span></a> shows that nodes participating in the
        routing process transmit messages to determine their neighbors
        (neighbor discovery). Using the neighboring relationships, routing
        protocols may exchange network topology (including link-specific
        information) to generate routes or may exchange routes directly as
        part of a routing exchange; nodes which do not directly participate in
        the process with a given node will get the route/topology information
        relayed from others. It is likely that a node will store some or all
        of the routes and topology information according to tradeoffs of node
        resources and latency associated with the particular routing protocol.
        The nodes use the derived routes for making forwarding decisions.

The CIA Security Reference Model</h3>

<p>At the conceptual level, security within an information system in
        general and applied to ROLL in particular is concerned with the
        primary issues of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. In the
        context of ROLL:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Confidentiality</dt>
<dd>Confidentiality involves
            the protection of routing information as well as routing neighbor
            maintenance exchanges so that only authorized and intended network
            entities may view or access it. Because of the wireless, and
            sometimes ad hoc, nature of the network, confidentiality also
            extends to the neighbor state and database information within the
            routing device since the deployment of the network creates the
            potential for unauthorized access to the physical devices
            themselves.
</dd>
<dt>Integrity</dt>
<dd>Integrity, as a security
            principle, entails the protection of routing information and
            routing neighbor maintenance exchanges, as well as derived
            information maintained in the database, from misuse or
            unauthorized and improper modification. In addition, integrity
            also requires the authenticity of claimed identity in the origin
            and destination of a message, access and removal of data,
            execution of the routing process, and use of computing and energy
            resources.
</dd>
<dt>Availability</dt>
<dd>Availability ensures that
            routing information exchanges and forwarding services need to be
            available when they are required for the functioning of the
            serving network. Availability will apply to maintaining efficient
            and correct operation of routing and neighbor discovery exchanges
            (including needed information) and forwarding services so as not
            to impair or limit the network's central traffic flow
            function.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>It is noted that, besides those captured in the CIA model,
        non-repudiation is another security concern evaluated. With respect to
        routing, non-repudiation will involve providing some ability to allow
        traceability or network management review of participants of the
        routing process including the ability to determine the events and
        actions leading to a particular routing state. Non-repudiation implies
        after the fact and thus relies on the logging or other capture of
        on-going routing exchanges. Given the limited resources of a node and
        potentially the communication channel, and considering the operating
        mode associated with LLNs, routing transaction logging or auditing
        process communication overhead will not be practical; as such,
        non-repudiation is not further considered as a relevant ROLL security
        issue.
</p>
<p>Based upon the CIA model, a high-level assessment of the security
        needs of the assets found in <a class='info' href='#assets'>Section&nbsp;3.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Routing Assets and Points of Access</span><span>)</span></a> shows
        that</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>routing/topology information needs to be integrity protected,
            maintained with confidentiality, and prevented from unauthorized
            use;
</li>
<li>neighbor discovery process needs to operate without undermining
            routing availability;
</li>
<li>routing/topology exchange process needs to ensure that the
            participants are authenticated, the communication of information
            is integrity protected and confidential;
</li>
<li>communication channels and node resources need to have their
            availability maintained;
</li>
<li>the internal and external interfaces of a node need to be
            protected to ensure that integrity and confidentiality of stored
            information is maintained as well as the integrity of routing and
            route generation processes is assured.
</li>
</ul><p>Each individual system's use and environment will dictate how
        the above general assessments are applied, including the choices of
        security services as well as the strengths of the mechanisms that must
        be implemented. The next subsection brings LLN-related issues to
        light.

Vermeylen, &ldquo;Building Automation Routing Requirements in Low Power and Lossy Networks,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>, have identified
        ROLL specific requirements and constraints; the following is a list of
        observations and evaluation of their impact on routing security
        considerations.
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Limited energy reserve, memory, and processing resources</dt>
<dd>As
            a consequence of these constraints, there is an even more critical
            need than usual for a careful trade study on which and what level
            of security services are to be afforded during the system design
            process. In addition, routing schemes based on various metrics
            have been proposed, e.g., geographic location. Transmission and
            exchanging such metrics may have security and/or privacy
            concerns.
</dd>
<dt>Large scale of rolled out network</dt>
<dd>The
            possibly numerous nodes to be deployed, as well as the general
            level of expertise of the installers, make manual on-site
            configuration unlikely. Prolonged rollout and delayed addition of
            nodes, which may be from old inventory, over the lifetime of the
            network, also complicate the operations of key management.
</dd>
<dt>Autonomous operations</dt>
<dd>Self-forming and
            self-organizing are commonly prescribed requirements of ROLL. In
            other words, a ROLL protocol needs to contain elements of ad hoc
            networking and cannot rely on manual configuration for
            initialization or local filtering rules.
</dd>
<dt>Highly directional traffic</dt>
<dd>Some types of
            LLNs see a high percentage of their total traffic traverse between
            the nodes and the gateways where the LLNs connect to wired
            networks. The special routing status of and the greater volume of
            traffic near the gateways have routing security consequences.
</dd>
<dt>Unattended locations and limited physical security</dt>
<dd>Many
            applications have the nodes deployed in unattended or remote
            locations; furthermore, the nodes themselves are often built with
            minimal physical protection. These constraints lower the barrier
            of accessing the data or security material stored on the nodes
            through physical means.
</dd>
<dt>Support for mobility</dt>
<dd>On the one hand, only
            a number of applications require the support of mobile nodes,
            e.g., a home LLN that includes nodes on wearable health care
            devices or an industry LLN that includes nodes on cranes and
            vehicles. On the other hand, if a routing protocol is indeed used
            in such applications, it will clearly need to have corresponding
            security mechanisms.
</dd>
<dt>Support for multicast and anycast</dt>
<dd>ROLL
            support for multicast and anycast is called out chiefly for
            large-scale networks. As these are relatively new routing
            technologies, there has been an ongoing effort devoted to their
            security mechanisms, e.g., from the IETF Multicast Security
            working group. However, the threat model and attack analysis are
            still areas not fully evaluated, and hence their impact is not yet
            fully understood, whether in a wired, wireless, or LLN.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>The above list considers how a LLN's physical constraints, size,
        operations, and varieties of application areas may impact security. It
        is noted here also that LLNs commonly have the majority, if not all,
        of their nodes equipped to route. One of the consequences is that the
        distinction between the link and network layers become artificial in
        some respects. Similarly, the distinction between a host and a router
        is blurred, especially when the set of applications running on a node
        is small. The continued evolution of ROLL and its security
        functionality requirements need close attention.

Threats and Attacks</h3>

<p>This section outlines general categories of threats under the CIA

      for ROLL. As defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC4949'>[RFC4949]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Shirey, R., &ldquo;Internet Security Glossary, Version 2,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>, a threat is "a
      potential for violation of security, which exists when there is a
      circumstance, capability, action, or event that could breach security
      and cause harm." An attack is "an assault on system security that
      derives from an intelligent threat, i.e., an intelligent act that is a
      deliberate attempt (especially in the sense of a method or technique) to
      evade security services and violate the security policy of a
      system."
</p>
<p>The subsequent subsections consider the threats and their realizing
      attacks that can cause security breaches under the CIA model to the
      assets identified in <a class='info' href='#assets'>Section&nbsp;3.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Routing Assets and Points of Access</span><span>)</span></a>. The analysis steps
      through the security concerns of each routing asset and looks at the

      attacks is assumed to be from either inside or outside attackers, whose
      capabilities may be limited to node-equivalent or more sophisticated

Node Resource Exhaustion</h3>

<p>A potential security threat to routing can arise from attempts to
          exhaust the node resource asset by initiating exchanges that can
          lead to the undue utilization of exhaustion of processing, memory or
          energy resources. The establishment and maintenance of routing
          neighbors opens the routing process to engagement and potential
          acceptance of multiple neighboring peers. Association information
          must be stored for each peer entity and for the wireless network
          operation provisions made to periodically update and reassess the
          associations. An introduced proliferation of apparent routing peers
          can therefore have a negative impact on node resources.
</p>
<p>Node resources may also be unduly consumed by the attackers
          attempting uncontrolled topology peering or routing exchanges,
          routing replays, or the generating of other data traffic floods.
          Beyond the disruption of communications channel resources, these
          threats may be able to exhaust node resources only where the
          engagements are able to proceed with the peer routing entities.
          Routing operation and network forwarding functions can thus be
          adversely impacted by node resources exhaustion that stems from

Confidentiality Attack Countermeasures</h3>

<p>Attacks on confidentiality may be mounted at the level of the
        routing information assets, at the points of access associated with
        routing exchanges between nodes, or through device interface access.
        To gain access to routing/topology information, the attacker may rely
        on a compromised node that deliberately exposes the information during
        the routing exchange process, may rely on passive sniffing or analysis
        of routing traffic, or may attempt access through a component or
        device interface of a tampered routing node.

<a name="rfc.section.5.1.1"></a><h3>5.1.1.&nbsp;
Countering Deliberate Exposure Attacks</h3>

<p>A deliberate exposure attack is one in which an entity that is
          party to the routing process or topology exchange allows the
          routing/topology information or generated route information to be
          exposed to an unauthorized entity during the exchange.
</p>
<p>A prerequisite to countering this type of confidentiality attacks
          associated with the routing/topology exchange is to ensure that the
          communicating nodes are authenticated prior to data encryption
          applied in the routing exchange. Authentication ensures that the
          nodes are who they claim to be even though it does not provide an
          indication of whether the node has been compromised.
</p>
<p>To prevent deliberate exposure, the process that communicating
          nodes use for establishing communication session keys must be
          symmetric at each node so that neither node can independently weaken
          the confidentiality of the exchange without the knowledge of its
          communicating peer. A deliberate exposure attack will therefore
          require more overt and independent action on the part of the
          offending node.
</p>
<p>Note that the same measures which apply to securing
          routing/topology exchanges between operational nodes must also
          extend to field tools and other devices used in a deployed network
          where such devices can be configured to participate in routing
          exchanges.

<a name="rfc.section.5.1.2"></a><h3>5.1.2.&nbsp;
Countering Sniffing Attacks</h3>

<p>A sniffing attack seeks to breach routing confidentiality through
          passive, direct analysis and processing of the information exchanges
          between nodes. A sniffing attack in an LLN that is not based on a
          physical device compromise will rely on the attacker attempting to
          directly derive information from the over-the-air routing/topology
          communication exchange (neighbor discovery exchanges may of
          necessity be conducted in the clear thus limiting the extent to
          which the information can be kept confidential).
</p>
<p>Sniffing attacks can be directly countered through the use of
          data encryption for all routing exchanges. Only when a validated and
          authenticated node association is completed will routing exchange be
          allowed to proceed using established session confidentiality keys
          and an agreed confidentiality algorithm. The level of security
          applied in providing confidentiality will determine the minimum
          requirement for an attacker mounting this passive security attack.
          Because of the resource constraints of LLN devices, symmetric
          (private) key session security will provide the best tradeoff in
          terms of node and channel resource overhead and the level of
          security achieved. This will of course not preclude the use of
          asymmetric (public) key encryption during the session key
          establishment phase.
</p>
<p>As with the key establishment process, data encryption must
          include an authentication prerequisite to ensure that each node is
          implementing a level of security that prevents deliberate or
          inadvertent exposure. The authenticated key establishment will
          ensure that confidentiality is not compromised by providing the
          information to an unauthorized entity (see also <a class='info' href='#Huang2003'>[Huang2003]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Huang, Q., Cukier, J., Kobayashi, H., Liu, B., and J. Zhang, &ldquo;Fast Authenticated Key Establishment Protocols for           Self-Organizing Sensor Networks,&rdquo; Sept. 19&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>).
</p>
<p>Based on the current state of the art, a minimum 128-bit key
          length should be applied where robust confidentiality is demanded
          for routing protection. This session key shall be applied in
          conjunction with an encryption algorithm that has been publicly
          vetted and where applicable approved for the level of security
          desired. Algorithms such as AES (adopted by the U.S. government) or
          Kasumi-Misty (adopted by the 3GPP 3rd generation wireless mobile
          consortium) are examples of symmetric-key algorithms capable of
          ensuring robust confidentiality for routing exchanges. The key
          length, algorithm and mode of operation will be selected as part of
          the overall security tradeoff that also achieves a balance with the
          level of confidentiality afforded by the physical device in
          protecting the routing assets (see <a class='info' href='#phy'>Section&nbsp;5.1.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Countering Physical Device Compromise</span><span>)</span></a>
          below).
</p>
<p>As with any encryption algorithm, the use of ciphering
          synchronization parameters and limitations to the usage duration of
          established keys should be part of the security specification to
          reduce the potential for brute force analysis.

<a name="rfc.section.5.1.3"></a><h3>5.1.3.&nbsp;
Countering Traffic Analysis</h3>

<p>Traffic analysis provides an indirect means of subverting
          confidentiality and gaining access to routing information by
          allowing an attacker to indirectly map the connectivity or flow
          patterns (including link-load) of the network from which other
          attacks can be mounted. The traffic analysis attack on a LLN may be
          passive and relying on the ability to read the immutable
          source/destination routing information that must remain unencrypted
          to permit network routing. Alternatively, attacks can be active
          through the injection of unauthorized discovery traffic into the
          network. By implementing authentication measures between
          communicating nodes, active traffic analysis attacks can be
          prevented within the LLN thereby reducing confidentiality
          vulnerabilities to those associated with passive analysis.
</p>
<p>One way in which passive traffic analysis attacks can be muted is
          through the support of load balancing that allows traffic to a given
          destination to be sent along diverse routing paths. Where the
          routing protocol supports load balancing along multiple links at
          each node, the number of routing permutations in a wide area network
          surges thus increasing the cost of traffic analysis. Network
          analysis through this passive attack will require a wider array of
          analysis points and additional processing on the part of the
          attacker. In LLNs, the diverse radio connectivity and dynamic links
          (including potential frequency hopping) will help to further
          mitigate traffic analysis attacks when load balancing is
          implemented.
</p>
<p>The only means of fully countering a traffic analysis attack is
          through the use of tunneling (encapsulation) where encryption is
          applied across the entirety of the original packet
          source/destination addresses. With tunneling there is a further
          requirement that the encapsulating intermediate nodes apply an
          additional layer of routing so that traffic arrives at the
          destination through dynamic routes. For LLNs, memory and processing
          constraints as well as the limitations of the communication channel
          will preclude both the additional routing traffic overhead and the
          node implementation required for tunneling countermeasures to
          traffic analysis.

Countering Physical Device Compromise</h3>

<p>Given the distributed nature of LLNs, confidentiality of routing
          assets and points of access will rely heavily on the security of the
          routing devices. One means of precluding attacks on the physical
          device is to prevent physical access to the node through other
          external security means. However, given the environment in which
          LLNs operate, preventing unauthorized access to the physical device
          cannot be assured. Countermeasures must therefore be employed at the
          device and component level so that routing/topology or neighbor
          information and stored route information cannot be accessed even if
          physical access to the node is obtained.
</p>
<p>With the physical device in the possession of an attacker,
          unauthorized information access can be attempted by probing internal
          interfaces or device components. Device security must therefore move
          to preventing the reading of device processor code or memory
          locations without the appropriate security keys and in preventing
          the access to any information exchanges occurring between individual
          components. Information access will then be restricted to external
          interfaces in which confidentiality, integrity and authentication
          measures can be applied.
</p>
<p>To prevent component information access, deployed routing devices
          must ensure that their implementation avoids address or data buses
          being connected to external general purpose input/output (GPIO)
          pins. Beyond this measure, an important component interface to be
          protected against attack is the Joint Test Action Group (JTAG)
          interface used for component and populated circuit board testing
          after manufacture. To provide security on the routing devices,
          components should be employed that allow fuses on the JTAG
          interfaces to be blown to disable access. This will raise the bar on
          unauthorized component information access within a captured
          device.
</p>
<p>At the device level a key component information exchange is
          between the microprocessor and it associated external memory. While
          encryption can be implemented to secure data bus exchanges, the use
          of integrated physical packaging which avoids inter-component
          exchanges (other than secure external device exchanges) will
          increase routing security against a physical device interface
          attack. With an integrated package and disabled internal component
          interfaces, the level of physical device security can be controlled
          by managing the degree to which the device packaging is protected
          against expert physical decomposition and analysis.
</p>
<p>The device package should be hardened such that attempts to
          remove the integrated components will result in damage to access
          interfaces, ports or pins that prevent retrieval of code or stored
          information. The degree of VLSI or PCB package security through
          manufacture can be selected as a tradeoff or desired security
          consistent with the level of security achieved by measures applied
          for other routing assets and points of access. With package
          hardening and restricted component access countermeasures, the
          security level will be raised to that provided by measures employed
          at the external communications interfaces.
</p>
<p>Another area of node interface vulnerability is that associated
          with interfaces provided for remote software or firmware upgrades.
          This may impact both routing information and routing/topology
          exchange security where it leads to unauthorized upgrade or change
          to the routing protocol running on a given node as this type of
          attack can allow for the execution of compromised or intentionally
          malicious routing code on multiple nodes. Countermeasures to this
          device interface confidentiality attack needs to be addressed in the
          larger context of node remote access security. This will ensure not
          only the authenticity of the provided code (including routing
          protocol) but that the process is initiated by an authorized
          (authenticated) entity.
</p>
<p>The above identified countermeasures against attacks on routing
          information confidentiality through internal device interface
          compromise must be part of the larger LLN system security as they
          cannot be addressed within the routing protocol itself. Similarly,
          the use of field tools or other devices that allow explicit access
          to node information must implement security mechanisms to ensure
          that routing information can be protected against unauthorized
          access. These protections will also be external to the routing
          protocol and hence not part of ROLL.

Countering Remote Device Access Attacks</h3>

<p>Where LLN nodes are deployed in the field, measures are

          provided field tool. In the case of network management a node can be
          directly requested to provide routing tables and neighbor
          information.
</p>
<p>To ensure confidentiality of the node routing information against
          attacks through remote access, any device local or remote requesting
          routing information must be authenticated to ensure authorized
          access. Since remote access is not invoked as part of a routing
          protocol security of routing information stored on the node against
          remote access will not be addressable as part of the routing

Countering Identity (including Sybil) Attacks</h3>

<p>Identity attacks, sometimes simply called spoofing, seek to gain

          routing, an identity attacker can illegitimately participate in
          routing exchanges, distribute false routing information, or cause an
          invalid outcome of a routing process.
</p>
<p>A perpetrator of Sybil attacks assumes multiple identities. The

          extension to new areas, e.g., where geographic distribution is

          LLN.
</p>
<p>The counter of identity attacks need to ensure the authenticity

Countering Routing Information Replay Attacks</h3>

<p>In routing, message replay can result in false topology and/or

          should take into account how a particular mechanism is made
          available in a LLN. For example, many LLNs have a central source of

Availability Attack Countermeasures</h3>

<p>As alluded to before, availability requires that routing
        information exchanges and forwarding mechanisms be available when
        needed so as to guarantee a proper functioning of the network. This
        may, e.g., include the correct operation of routing information and
        neighbor state information exchanges, among others. We will highlight
        the key features of the security threats along with typical
        countermeasures to prevent or at least mitigate them. We will also
        note that an availability attack may be facilitated by an identity
        attack as well as a replay attack, as was addressed in <a class='info' href='#entity'>Section&nbsp;5.2.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Countering Identity (including Sybil) Attacks</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#replay'>Section&nbsp;5.2.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Countering Routing Information Replay Attacks</span><span>)</span></a>,

Countering HELLO Flood Attacks and ACK Spoofing Attacks</h3>

<p>HELLO Flood <a class='info' href='#Karlof2003'>[Karlof2003]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Karlof, C. and D. Wagner, &ldquo;Secure routing in wireless sensor networks: attacks and           countermeasures,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>,<a class='info' href='#I-D.suhopark-hello-wsn'>[I&#8209;D.suhopark&#8209;hello&#8209;wsn]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Park, S., &ldquo;Routing Security in Sensor Network: HELLO Flood Attack and Defense,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> and ACK Spoofing attacks are
          different but highly related forms of attacking a LLN. They
          essentially lead nodes to believe that suitable routes are available
          even though they are not and hence constitute a serious availability
          attack.
</p>
<p>The origin of facilitating a HELLO flood attack lies in the fact
          that many wireless routing protocols require nodes to send HELLO
          packets either upon joining or in regular intervals so as to
          announce or confirm their existence to the network. Those nodes that
          receive the HELLO packet assume that they are within radio range of
          the transmitter by means of a bidirectional communication link.
</p>
<p>With this in mind, a malicious node can send or replay HELLO
          packets using a higher transmission power. That creates the false
          illusion of being a neighbor to an increased number of nodes in the
          network, thereby effectively increasing its unidirectional
          neighborhood cardinality. The high quality of the falsely advertised
          link may coerce nodes to route data via the malicious node. However,
          those affected nodes, for which the malicious node is out of radio
          range, never succeed in their delivery and the packets are
          effectively dropped. The symptoms are hence similar to those of a
          sinkhole, wormhole and selective forwarding attack.
</p>
<p>A malicious HELLO flood attack clearly distorts the network
          topology. It thus affects protocols building and maintaining the
          network topology as well as routing protocols as such, since the
          attack is primarily targeted on protocols that require sharing of
          information for topology maintenance or flow control.
</p>
<p>To counter HELLO flood attacks, several mutually non-exclusive
          methods are feasible:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>restricting neighborhood cardinality;
</li>
<li>facilitating multipath routing;
</li>
<li>verifying bidirectionality.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Restricting the neighborhood cardinality prevents malicious nodes
          from having an extended set of neighbors beyond some tolerated
          threshold and thereby preventing topologies to be built where
          malicious nodes have an extended neighborhood set. Furthermore, as
          shown in <a class='info' href='#I-D.suhopark-hello-wsn'>[I&#8209;D.suhopark&#8209;hello&#8209;wsn]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Park, S., &ldquo;Routing Security in Sensor Network: HELLO Flood Attack and Defense,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>, if the
          routing protocol supports multiple paths from a sensing node towards
          several gateways then HELLO flood attacks can also be diminished;
          however, the energy-efficiency of such approach is clearly
          sub-optimal. Finally, verifying that the link is truly bidirectional
          by means of, e.g., an ACK handshake and appropriate security
          measures ensures that a communication link is only established if
          not only the affected node is within range of the malicious node but
          also vice versa. Whilst this does not really eliminate the problem
          of HELLO flooding, it greatly reduces the number of affected nodes
          and the probability of such an attack succeeding.
</p>
<p>As for the latter, the adversary may spoof the ACK messages to
          convince the affected node that the link is truly bidirectional and
          thereupon drop, tunnel or selectively forward messages. Such ACK
          spoofing attack is possible if the malicious node has a receiver
          which is significantly more sensitive than that of a normal node,
          thereby effectively extending its range. Since an ACK spoofing
          attack facilitates a HELLO flood attack, similar countermeasure are
          applicable here. Viable counter and security measures for both
          attacks have been exposed in <a class='info' href='#I-D.suhopark-hello-wsn'>[I&#8209;D.suhopark&#8209;hello&#8209;wsn]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Park, S., &ldquo;Routing Security in Sensor Network: HELLO Flood Attack and Defense,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>.

<a name="rfc.section.5.3.2"></a><h3>5.3.2.&nbsp;
Countering Overload Attacks</h3>

<p>Overload attacks are a form of DoS attack in that a malicious
          node overloads the network with irrelevant traffic, thereby draining
          the nodes' energy budget quicker. It thus significantly shortens the
          network lifetime and hence constitutes another serious availability
          attack.
</p>
<p>With energy being one of the most precious assets of LLNs,
          targeting its availability is a fairly obvious attack. Another way
          of depleting the energy of a LLN node is to have the malicious node
          overload the network with irrelevant traffic. This impacts
          availability since certain routes get congested which</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>renders them useless for affected nodes and data can hence
              not be delivered;
</li>
<li>makes routes longer as shortest path algorithms work with the
              congested network;
</li>
<li>depletes nodes quicker and thus shortens the network's
              availability at large.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Overload attacks can be countered by deploying a series of
          mutually non-exclusive security measures:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>introduce quotas on the traffic rate each node is allowed to
              send;
</li>
<li>isolate nodes which send traffic above a certain
              threshold;
</li>
<li>allow only trusted data to be received and forwarded.
</li>
</ul>

<p>As for the first one, a simple approach to minimize the harmful
          impact of an overload attack is to introduce traffic quotas. This
          prevents a malicious node from injecting a large amount of traffic
          into the network, even though it does not prevent said node from
          injecting irrelevant traffic at all. Another method is to isolate
          nodes from the network once it has been detected that more traffic
          is injected into the network than allowed by a prior set or
          dynamically adjusted threshold. Finally, if communication is
          sufficiently secured, only trusted nodes can receive and forward
          traffic which also lowers the risk of an overload attack.

<a name="rfc.section.5.3.3"></a><h3>5.3.3.&nbsp;
Countering Selective Forwarding Attacks</h3>

<p>Selective forwarding attacks are another form of DoS attack which
          impacts the routing path availability.
</p>
<p>An insider malicious node basically blends neatly in with the
          network but then may decide to forward and/or manipulate certain
          packets. If all packets are dropped, then this attacker is also
          often referred to as a "black hole". Such a form of attack is
          particularly dangerous if coupled with sinkhole attacks since
          inherently a large amount of traffic is attracted to the malicious
          node and thereby causing significant damage. An outside malicious
          node would selectively jam overheard data flows, where the thus
          caused collisions incur selective forwarding.
</p>
<p>Selective Forwarding attacks can be countered by deploying a
          series of mutually non-exclusive security measures:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>multipath routing of the same message over disjoint
              paths;
</li>
<li>dynamically select the next hop from a set of candidates.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The first measure basically guarantees that if a message gets
          lost on a particular routing path due to a malicious selective
          forwarding attack, there will be another route which successfully
          delivers the data. Such method is inherently suboptimal from an
          energy consumption point of view. The second method basically
          involves a constantly changing routing topology in that next-hop
          routers are chosen from a dynamic set in the hope that the number of
          malicious nodes in this set is negligible.

<a name="rfc.section.5.3.4"></a><h3>5.3.4.&nbsp;
Countering Sinkhole Attacks</h3>

<p>In sinkhole attacks, the malicious node manages to attract a lot
          of traffic mainly by advertising the availability of high-quality
          links even though there are none. It hence constitutes a serious
          attack on availability.
</p>
<p>The malicious node creates a sinkhole by attracting a large
          amount of, if not all, traffic from surrounding neighbors by
          advertising in and outwards links of superior quality. Affected
          nodes hence eagerly route their traffic via the malicious node
          which, if coupled with other attacks such as selective forwarding,
          may lead to serious availability and security breaches. Such an
          attack can only be executed by an inside malicious node and is
          generally very difficult to detect. An ongoing attack has a profound
          impact on the network topology and essentially becomes a problem of
          flow control.
</p>
<p>Sinkhole attacks can be countered by deploying a series of
          mutually non-exclusive security measures:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>use geographical insights for flow control;
</li>
<li>isolate nodes which receive traffic above a certain
              threshold;
</li>
<li>dynamically pick up next hop from set of candidates;
</li>
<li>allow only trusted data to be received and forwarded.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Whilst most of these countermeasures have been discussed before,
          the use of geographical information deserves further attention.
          Essentially, if geographic positions of nodes are available, then
          the network can assure that data is actually routed towards the
          sink(s) and not elsewhere. On the other hand, geographic position is
          a sensitive information that may have security and/or privacy
          consequences.

<a name="rfc.section.5.3.5"></a><h3>5.3.5.&nbsp;
Countering Wormhole Attacks</h3>

<p>In wormhole attacks at least two malicious nodes shortcut or
          divert the usual routing path by means of a low-latency out-of-band
          channel. This changes the availability of certain routing paths and
          hence constitutes a serious security breach.
</p>
<p>Essentially, two malicious insider nodes use another, more
          powerful, radio to communicate with each other and thereby distort
          the would-be-agreed routing path. This distortion could involve
          shortcutting and hence paralyzing a large part of the network; it
          could also involve tunneling the information to another region of
          the network where there are, e.g., more malicious nodes available to
          aid the intrusion or where messages are replayed, etc. In
          conjunction with selective forwarding, wormhole attacks can create
          race conditions which impact topology maintenance, routing protocols
          as well as any security suits built on "time of check" and "time of
          use".
</p>
<p>Wormhole attacks are very difficult to detect in general but can
          be mitigated using similar strategies as already outlined above in
          the context of sinkhole attacks.
