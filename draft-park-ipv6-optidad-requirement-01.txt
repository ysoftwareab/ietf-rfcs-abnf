1. Introduction 
    
   In order to generate unique address, an IPv6 node has to perform DAD 
   (Duplicate Address Detection) procedure when the IPv6 node tries to 
   make its own IPv6 address including link-local and global address.  
    
   However, a proper support for real time multimedia applications in 
   mobile environment is undermined by the disruption imposed by DAD. 
    
   Recently, some considerations are being suggested for DAD 
   optimization mechanisms to provide fast handover when a mobile node 
   is connected to the new networks. Real-time services require layer 3 
   handovers between IPv6 networks to be completed quickly and with 
   minimal packet loss. All IPv6 nodes must perform DAD every time they 
   handover between IPv6 networks. DAD described in [3] is a time 
   consuming process, particularly when nodes in need of seamless 
   handover run it. During DAD time, any active communications of nodes 
   are interrupted, and this is especially unsuitable for real-time 
   services.  
    
   This document clarifies the requirements for IPv6 DAD optimization at 
   the real time communications especially IPv6 mobility.

2. Intention / Scenario 
    
   The intention is to minimize address configuration delays in the 
   successful case without greatly increasing disruption in the less 
   likely failure case. DAD optimization is a useful when a DAD is far 
   more likely to succeed than fail for randomly autoconfigured 
   addresses.  This makes it worth a little disruption in the failure 
   case to provide faster handovers in the successful case, as long as 
   the disruption is easily recoverable.  
    
   Note that nodes which have DAD optimization functions SHOULD 
   interoperate with nodes which have original DAD functions. 
    
    
3. Requirements for IPv6 DAD Optimization 
    
   The purpose of the DAD optimization mechanism is to provide 
   continuous real time communication like faster handovers in IPv6 
   mobility. 
    
    
3.1 Comparison with Original DAD 
    
   When an original DAD is performed to verify address duplication, 
   there happened to be some delays (is defined in [3]) in this case. In 
   order to reduce delays, optimized DAD should be required to provide 
   faster handover in the IPv6 mobility. Though, at the same time, it 
   should be noted that the DAD optimization MUST NOT break the original 
   DAD mechanism. 
    
    
3.2 Neighbor Cache 
    
   The Neighbor Cache entries MUST NOT be modified in a way which is 
   unrecoverable through original DAD operation [3]. For effective DAD 
   optimization, there are no restrictive requirements to modify 
   Neighbor Cache entry in the specific cases. Immediately on completing 
   the appropriate DAD procedure for either original DAD or DAD 
   optimization, all Neighbor?NC (Neighbor Cache) MUST be updated 
   appropriately. 
    
    
3.3 Host Modifications 
    
   The DAD optimization SHOULD allow for the use of original DAD and NDP 
   (Neighbor Discovery Protocol) to a host even if a host wants to be

   modified for DAD optimization. For DAD optimization, a host including 
   neighbor MUST recognize modifications such as specific fields, flags, 
   values, etc. 
    
    
3.4 Router Modifications 
    
   The DAD optimization SHOULD allow for the use of original DAD and NDP 
   to a router even if a router wants to be modified for DAD 
   optimization. For DAD optimization, a router MUST provide host 
   requirements. 
    
    
3.5 Security 
    
   The DAD optimization scheme SHOULD NOT introduce any new attacks on 
   Neighbor Discovery and the resulting schemes should be no worse than 
   existing DAD [3]. There are existing security concerns with Neighbor 
   Discovery and Stateless Address Autoconfiguration. These schemes 
   SHOULD interoperate with Secure Neighbor DAD mechanisms as defined in 
   SEND WG. 
    
    
3.6 Address Duplication Considerations 
    
   In the simplest collision case, the address being configured by the 
   new node is already in use by another node, and present in the 
   Neighbor Caches of neighbors which are communicating with this node. 
   At this case, all nodes MUST detect address duplication either 
   original DAD or DAD optimization. 
    
    
3.7 Layer 2 Considerations 
    
   Generally, address duplication is happened to the same Interface ID 
   which is composed of 48bit/64bit MAC address. Therefore, when same 
   MAC address is existed in the same link, one of these nodes can not 
   make its IPv6 address using address autoconfiguration mechanism. At 
   this case, all nodes MUST be allowed to generate new addresses by 
   another mechanism. It should be clarified that the mechanisms should 
   be more discussed in the near future. 
    
    
4. IANA Considerations 
    
   There are no IANA considerations in this document.
