<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>This document provides a framework for the development of IP
      fast-reroute mechanisms which provide protection against link or router
      failure by invoking locally determined repair paths. Unlike MPLS
      fast-reroute, the mechanisms are applicable to a network employing
      conventional IP routing and forwarding.

Introduction</h3>

<p>When a link or node failure occurs in a routed network, there is
      inevitably a period of disruption to the delivery of traffic until the
      network re-converges on the new topology. Packets for destinations which
      were previously reached by traversing the failed component may be
      dropped or may suffer looping. Traditionally such disruptions have
      lasted for periods of at least several seconds, and most applications
      have been constructed to tolerate such a quality of service.
</p>
<p>Recent advances in routers have reduced this interval to under a
      second for carefully configured networks using link state IGPs. However,
      new Internet services are emerging which may be sensitive to periods of
      traffic loss which are orders of magnitude shorter than this.
</p>
<p>Addressing these issues is difficult because the distributed nature
      of the network imposes an intrinsic limit on the minimum convergence
      time which can be achieved.
</p>
<p>However, there is an alternative approach, which is to compute backup
      routes that allow the failure to be repaired locally by the router(s)
      detecting the failure without the immediate need to inform other routers
      of the failure. In this case, the disruption time can be limited to the
      small time taken to detect the adjacent failure and invoke the backup
      routes. This is analogous to the technique employed by MPLS fast-reroute
      <a class='info' href='#RFC4090'>[RFC4090]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Pan, P., Swallow, G., and A. Atlas, &ldquo;Fast Reroute Extensions to RSVP-TE for LSP Tunnels,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>, but the mechanisms employed for the
      backup routes in pure IP networks are necessarily very different.
</p>
<p>This document provides a framework for the development of this
      approach.

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
Problem Analysis</h3>

<p>The duration of the packet delivery disruption caused by a
      conventional routing transition is determined by a number of factors:
      </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>The time taken to detect the failure. This may be of the order of
          a few milliseconds when it can be detected at the physical layer, up
          to several tens of seconds when a routing protocol hello is
          employed. During this period packets will be unavoidably lost.
</li>
<li>The time taken for the local router to react to the failure. This
          will typically involve generating and flooding new routing updates,
          perhaps after some hold-down delay, and re-computing the router's
          FIB.
</li>
<li>The time taken to pass the information about the failure to other
          routers in the network. In the absence of routing protocol packet
          loss, this is typically between 10 milliseconds and 100 milliseconds
          per hop.
</li>
<li>The time taken to re-compute the forwarding tables. This is
          typically a few milliseconds for a link state protocol using
          Dijkstra's algorithm.
</li>
<li>The time taken to load the revised forwarding tables into the
          forwarding hardware. This time is very implementation dependant and
          also depends on the number of prefixes affected by the failure, but
          may be several hundred milliseconds.
</li>
</ol><p>The disruption will last until the routers adjacent to the
      failure have completed steps 1 and 2, and then all the routers in the
      network whose paths are affected by the failure have completed the
      remaining steps.
</p>
<p>The initial packet loss is caused by the router(s) adjacent to the
      failure continuing to attempt to transmit packets across the failure
      until it is detected. This loss is unavoidable, but the detection time
      can be reduced to a few tens of milliseconds as described in <a class='info' href='#fast-failure-detect'>Section&nbsp;4.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mechanisms for fast failure detection </span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>In some topologies subsequent packet loss may be caused by the
      "micro-loops" which may form as a result of temporary inconsistencies
      between routers' forwarding tables<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-rtgwg-lf-conv-frmwk'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;rtgwg&#8209;lf&#8209;conv&#8209;frmwk]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Shand, M. and S. Bryant, &ldquo;A Framework for Loop-free Convergence,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>. When micro-loops occur,
      this is as a result of the different times at which routers update their
      forwarding tables to reflect the failure. These variable delays are
      caused by steps 3, 4 and 5 above and in many routers it is step 5 which
      is both the largest factor and which has the greatest variance between
      routers. The large variance arises from implementation differences and
      from the differing impact that a failure has on each individual router.
      For example, the number of prefixes affected by the failure may vary
      dramatically from one router to another.
</p>
<p>In order to achieve packet disruption times which are commensurate
      with the failure detection times two factors must be considered:-
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>The provision of a mechanism for the router(s) adjacent to the
          failure to rapidly invoke a repair path, which is unaffected by any
          subsequent re-convergence.

<p>Performing the first task without the second may result in the repair
      path being starved of traffic and hence being redundant. Performing the

</p>
<p>Repair paths may always be used in isolation where the failure is
      short-lived. In this case, the repair paths can be kept in place until
      the failure is repaired in which case there is no need to advertise the
      failure to other routers.
</p>
<p>Similarly, micro-loop avoidance may be used in isolation to prevent
      loops arising from pre-planned management action. In which case the link
      or node being shut down can remain in service for a short time after its
      removal has been announced into the network, and hence it can function
      as its own "repair path".
</p>
<p>Note that micro-loops may also occur when a link or node is restored
      to service and thus a micro-loop avoidance mechanism may be required for
      both link up and link down cases.

Mechanisms for repair paths</h3>

<p>Once a failure has been detected by one of the above mechanisms,
        traffic which previously traversed the failure is transmitted over one
        or more repair paths. The design of the repair paths should be such
        that they can be pre-calculated in anticipation of each local failure
        and made available for invocation with minimal delay. There are three
        basic categories of repair paths:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Equal cost multi-paths (ECMP). Where such paths exist, and one
            or more of the alternate paths do not traverse the failure, they
            may trivially be used as repair paths.
</li>
<li>Loop free alternate paths. Such a path exists when a direct
            neighbor of the router adjacent to the failure has a path to the
            destination which can be guaranteed not to traverse the
            failure.
</li>
<li>Multi-hop repair paths. When there is no feasible loop free
            alternate path it may still be possible to locate a router, which
            is more than one hop away from the router adjacent to the failure,
            from which traffic will be forwarded to the destination without
            traversing the failure.
</li>
</ol>

<p>ECMP and loop free alternate paths (as described in <a class='info' href='#RFC5286'>[RFC5286]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Atlas, A. and A. Zinin, &ldquo;Basic Specification for IP Fast Reroute: Loop-Free Alternates,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>) offer the simplest repair paths and would
        normally be used when they are available. It is anticipated that
        around 80% of failures (see <a class='info' href='#coverage'>Section&nbsp;4.2.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Analysis of repair coverage </span><span>)</span></a>) can be
        repaired using these basic methods alone.
</p>
<p>Multi-hop repair paths are more complex, both in the computations
        required to determine their existence, and in the mechanisms required
        to invoke them. They can be further classified as:</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Mechanisms where one or more alternate FIBs are pre-computed in
            all routers and the repaired packet is instructed to be forwarded

</li>
<li>Mechanisms functionally equivalent to a loose source route
            which is invoked using the normal FIB.

<li>Mechanisms employing special addresses or labels which are

</ol><p>In many cases a repair path which reaches two hops away from

        be repaired by this method. However, to provide complete repair

<a name="rfc.section.4.2.1"></a><h3>4.2.1.&nbsp;
Scope of repair paths </h3>

<p>A particular repair path may be valid for all destinations which
          require repair or may only be valid for a subset of destinations. If
          a repair path is valid for a node immediately downstream of the
          failure, then it will be valid for all destinations previously
          reachable by traversing the failure. However, in cases where such a
          repair path is difficult to achieve because it requires a high order
          multi-hop repair path, it may still be possible to identify lower
          order repair paths (possibly even loop free alternate paths) which
          allow the majority of destinations to be repaired. When IPFRR is
          unable to provide complete repair, it is desirable that the extent
          of the repair coverage can be determined and reported via network
          management.
</p>
<p>There is a tradeoff to be achieved between minimizing the number
          of repair paths to be computed, and minimizing the overheads
          incurred in using higher order multi-hop repair paths for
          destinations for which they are not strictly necessary. However, the
          computational cost of determining repair paths on an individual
          destination basis can be very high.
</p>
<p>It will frequently be the case that the majority of destinations
          may be repaired using only the "basic" repair mechanism, leaving a
          smaller subset of the destinations to be repaired using one of the
          more complex multi-hop methods. Such a hybrid approach may go some
          way to resolving the conflict between completeness and
          complexity.
</p>
<p>The use of repair paths may result in excessive traffic passing
          over a link, resulting in congestion discard. This reduces the
          effectiveness of IPFRR. Mechanisms to influence the distribution of
          repaired traffic to minimize this effect are therefore
          desirable.

Analysis of repair coverage </h3>

<p>In some cases the repair strategy will permit the repair of all
          single link or node failures in the network for all possible
          destinations. This can be defined as 100% coverage. However, where
          the coverage is less than 100% it is important for the purposes of
          comparisons between different proposed repair strategies to define
          what is meant by such a percentage. There are four possibilities:
          </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>The percentage of links (or nodes) which can be fully
              protected for all destinations. This is appropriate where the
              requirement is to protect all traffic, but some percentage of
              the possible failures may be identified as being
              un-protectable.
</li>
<li>The percentage of destinations which can be fully protected
              for all link (or node) failures. This is appropriate where the
              requirement is to protect against all possible failures, but
              some percentage of destinations may be identified as being
              un-protectable.
</li>
<li>For all destinations (d) and for all failures (f), the
              percentage of the total potential failure cases (d*f) which are
              protected. This is appropriate where the requirement is an
              overall "best effort" protection.
</li>
<li>The percentage of packets normally passing though the network
              that will continue to reach their destination. This requires a
              traffic matrix for the network as part of the analysis.
</li>
</ol><p>The coverage obtained is dependent on the repair strategy
          and highly dependent on the detailed topology and metrics. Any
          figures quoted in this document are for illustrative purposes
          only.

Link or node repair </h3>

<p>A repair path may be computed to protect against failure of an
          adjacent link, or failure of an adjacent node. In general, link
          protection is simpler to achieve. A repair which protects against
          node failure will also protect against link failure for all
          destinations except those for which the adjacent node is a single
          point of failure.
</p>
<p>In some cases it may be necessary to distinguish between a link
          or node failure in order that the optimal repair strategy is
          invoked. Methods for link/node failure determination may be based on
          techniques such as BFD<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-bfd-base'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;bfd&#8209;base]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Katz, D. and D. Ward, &ldquo;Bidirectional Forwarding Detection,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>. This
          determination may be made prior to invoking any repairs, but this
          will increase the period of packet loss following a failure unless
          the determination can be performed as part of the failure detection
          mechanism itself. Alternatively, a subsequent determination can be
          used to optimise an already invoked default strategy.

Maintenance of Repair paths  </h3>

<p>
</p>
<p>In order to meet the response time goals, it is expected (though
          not required) that repair paths, and their associated FIB entries,
          will be pre-computed and installed ready for invocation when a
          failure is detected. Following invocation the repair paths remain in
          effect until they are no longer required. This will normally be when
          the routing protocol has re-converged on the new topology taking
          into account the failure, and traffic will no longer be using the
          repair paths.
</p>
<p>The repair paths have the property that they are unaffected by
          any topology changes resulting from the failure which caused their
          instantiation. Therefore there is no need to re-compute them during
          the convergence period. They may be affected by an unrelated
          simultaneous topology change, but such events are out of scope of
          this work (see <a class='info' href='#SRLG'>Section&nbsp;4.2.5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Multiple failures and Shared Risk Link Groups  </span><span>)</span></a>).
</p>
<p>Once the routing protocol has re-converged it is necessary for
          all repair paths to take account of the new topology. Various
          optimizations may permit the efficient identification of repair
          paths which are unaffected by the change, and hence do not require
          full re-computation. Since the new repair paths will not be required
          until the next failure occurs, the re-computation may be performed
          as a background task and be subject to a hold-down, but excessive
          delay in completing this operation will increase the risk of a new
          failure occurring before the repair paths are in place.

Multiple failures and Shared Risk Link Groups  </h3>

<p>
</p>
<p>Complete protection against multiple unrelated failures is out of
          scope of this work. However, it is important that the occurrence of
          a second failure while one failure is undergoing repair should not
          result in a level of service which is significantly worse than that
          which would have been achieved in the absence of any repair
          strategy.
</p>
<p>Shared Risk Link Groups are an example of multiple related
          failures, and the more complex aspects of their protection is a
          matter for further study.
</p>
<p>One specific example of an SRLG which is clearly within the scope
          of this work is a node failure. This causes the simultaneous failure
          of multiple links, but their closely defined topological
          relationship makes the problem more tractable.
