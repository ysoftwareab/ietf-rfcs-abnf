    Updates to Resource Reservation Protocol For Fast Reroute of
                  Traffic Engineering GMPLS LSPs
             draft-ietf-teas-gmpls-lsp-fastreroute-11


Abstract

   This document updates the Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic
   Engineering (RSVP-TE) Fast Reroute (FRR) procedures defined in RFC
   4090 to support Packet Switched Capable (PSC) Generalized Multi-
   Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs).  These
   updates allow the coordination of a bidirectional bypass tunnel
   assignment protecting a common facility in both forward and reverse
   directions of a co-routed bidirectional LSP.  In addition, these
   updates enable the re-direction of bidirectional traffic onto bypass
   tunnels that ensure co-routedness of data paths in the forward and
   reverse directions after FRR and avoid RSVP soft-state timeout in
   control-plane.

Internet-Draft           FRR for TE GMPLS LSPs            August 3, 2017


1.  Introduction

   Packet Switched Capable (PSC) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched
   Paths (LSPs) can be setup using Generalized Multi-Protocol Label
   Switching (GMPLS) signaling procedures specified in [RFC3473] for
   both unidirectional and bidirectional tunnels.  The GMPLS signaling
   allows sending and receiving the RSVP messages in-band with the data
   traffic or out-of-band over a separate control-channel.  Fast Reroute
   (FRR) [RFC4090] has been widely deployed in the packet TE networks
   today and is desirable for TE GMPLS LSPs.  Using FRR methods also
   allows the leveraging of the existing mechanisms for failure
   detection and restoration in deployed networks.

   The FRR procedures defined in [RFC4090] describe the behavior of the
   Point of Local Repair (PLR) to reroute traffic and signaling onto the
   bypass tunnel in the event of a failure for protected LSPs.  Those
   procedures are applicable to the unidirectional protected LSPs
   signaled using either RSVP-TE [RFC3209] or GMPLS procedures
   [RFC3473].  When using the FRR procedures defined in [RFC4090] with
   co-routed bidirectional GMPLS LSPs, it is desired that same PLR and
   Merge Point (MP) pairs are selected in each direction and both PLR
   and MP assign the same bidirectional bypass tunnel.  This document
   updates the FRR procedures defined in [RFC4090] to coordinate the
   bidirectional bypass tunnel assignment and to exchange MP labels
   between upstream and downstream PLRs of the protected co-routed
   bidirectional LSP.

   When using FRR procedures with co-routed bidirectional GMPLS LSPs, it
   is possible in some cases for the RSVP signaling refreshes to stop
   reaching certain nodes along the protected LSP path after the PLRs
   finish rerouting of the signaling messages.  This can occur after a
   failure event when using node protection bypass tunnels.  As shown in
   Figure 2, this is possible even with selecting the same bidirectional
   bypass tunnels in both directions and the same PLR and MP pairs. 
   This is caused by the asymmetry of paths that may be taken by the
   bidirectional LSP's signaling in the forward and reverse directions
   due to upstream and downstream PLRs independently triggering FRR.  In
   such cases, after FRR, the RSVP soft-state timeout causes the
   protected bidirectional LSP to be torn down, with subsequent traffic
   loss.

   Protection State Coordination Protocol [RFC6378] is applicable to FRR
   [RFC4090] for local protection of co-routed bidirectional LSPs in
   order to minimize traffic disruptions in both directions.  However,
   this does not address the above mentioned problem of RSVP soft-state
   timeout that can occur in the control-plane.

   This document defines a solution to the RSVP soft-state timeout issue

   by providing mechanisms in the control-plane to complement the FRR
   procedures of [RFC4090].  The solution allows to maintain the RSVP
   soft-state for co-routed bidirectional protected GMPLS LSPs in the
   control-plane and achieve co-routedness of the paths followed by the
   traffic in the forward and reverse directions after FRR. 

   The procedures defined in this document apply to GMPLS signaled PSC
   TE co-routed bidirectional protected LSPs and co-routed bidirectional
   FRR bypass tunnels.  Unless otherwise specified in this document, the
   FRR procedures defined in [RFC4090] are not modified by this
   document.  The FRR mechanism for associated bidirectional GMPLS LSPs
   where two unidirectional GMPLS LSPs are bound together by using the
   association signaling [RFC7551] is outside the scope of this
   document.

2.1.  Key Word Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.2.  Terminology

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terminology in
   [RFC2205], [RFC3209], [RFC3471], [RFC3473], and [RFC4090].

   Downstream PLR: Downstream Point of Local Repair.  The PLR that
      locally detects a failure in the downstream direction of the
      traffic flow and reroutes traffic in the same direction of the
      protected bidirectional LSP RSVP Path signaling.  A downstream PLR
      has a corresponding downstream MP.

   Downstream MP: Downstream Merge Point.  The LSR where one or more
      backup tunnels rejoin the path of the protected LSP in the
      downstream direction of the traffic flow.  The same LSR can be
      both a downstream MP and an upstream PLR simultaneously.

   Upstream PLR: Upstream Point of Local Repair.  The PLR that locally
      detects a failure in the upstream direction of the traffic flow
      and reroutes traffic in the opposite direction of the protected
      bidirectional LSP RSVP Path signaling.  An upstream PLR has a
      corresponding upstream MP.

   Upstream MP: Upstream Merge Point.  The LSR where one or more backup
      tunnels rejoin the path of the protected LSP in the upstream

      direction of the traffic flow.  The same LSR can be both an
      upstream MP and a downstream PLR simultaneously.

   Point of Remote Repair (PRR): A downstream MP that assumes the role
      of upstream PLR upon receiving protected LSP's rerouted Path
      message and triggers reroute of traffic and signaling in the
      upstream direction of the traffic flow using the procedures
      described in this document.

3.  Fast Reroute For Unidirectional GMPLS LSPs

   The FRR procedures defined in [RFC4090] for RSVP-TE signaling
   [RFC3209] are equally applicable to the unidirectional protected LSPs
   signaled using GMPLS [RFC3473] and are not modified by the updates
   defined in this document except the following.  

   When using the GMPLS out-of-band signaling [RFC3473], after a link
   failure event, the RSVP messages are not rerouted over the bypass
   tunnel by the downstream PLR but instead rerouted over a
   control-channel to the downstream MP.


4.  Bypass Tunnel Assignment For Bidirectional GMPLS LSPs

   This section describes signaling procedures for FRR bidirectional
   bypass tunnel assignment for GMPLS signaled PSC co-routed
   bidirectional TE LSPs for both in-band and out-of-band signaling.

4.1.  Bidirectional GMPLS Bypass Tunnel Direction

   This document defines procedures where bidirectional GMPLS bypass
   tunnels are signaled in the same direction as the protected GMPLS
   LSPs.  In other words, the bidirectional GMPLS bypass tunnels
   originate on the downstream PLRs and terminate on the corresponding
   downstream MPs.  As the originating downstream PLR has the policy
   information about the locally provisioned bypass tunnels, it always
   initiates the bypass tunnel assignment.  The bidirectional GMPLS
   bypass tunnels originating from the upstream PLRs and terminating on
   the corresponding upstream MPs are outside the scope of this
   document.

4.2.  Merge Point Labels

   To correctly reroute data traffic over a node protection bypass
   tunnel, the downstream and upstream PLRs have to know, in advance,
   the downstream and upstream MP labels of the protected LSP so that
   data in the forward and reverse directions can be redirected through
   the bypass tunnel after FRR respectively.

   [RFC4090] defines procedures for the downstream PLR to obtain the
   protected LSP's downstream MP label from recorded labels in the
   RECORD_ROUTE Object (RRO) of the RSVP Resv message received at the
   downstream PLR.

   To obtain the upstream MP label, the procedures specified in
   [RFC4090] are used to record the upstream MP label in the RRO of the
   RSVP Path message of the protected LSP.  The upstream PLR obtains the
   upstream MP label from the recorded labels in the RRO of the received
   RSVP Path message.

4.3.  Merge Point Addresses

   To correctly assign a bidirectional bypass tunnel, the downstream and
   upstream PLRs have to know, in advance, the downstream and upstream
   MP addresses.  

   [RFC4561] defines procedures for the downstream PLR to obtain the
   protected LSP's downstream MP address from the recorded Node-IDs in
   the RRO of the RSVP Resv message received at the downstream PLR.

   To obtain the upstream MP address, the procedures specified in
   [RFC4561] are used to record upstream MP Node-ID in the RRO of the
   RSVP Path message of the protected LSP.  The upstream PLR obtains the
   upstream MP address from the recorded Node-IDs in the RRO of the
   received RSVP Path message.

4.4.  RRO IPv4/IPv6 Subobject Flags

   RRO IPv4/IPv6 subobject flags are defined in [RFC4090], Section 4.4
   and are equally applicable to the FRR procedure for the protected
   bidirectional GMPLS LSPs.

   The procedures defined in [RFC4090] are used by the downstream PLR to
   signal the IPv4/IPv6 subobject flags upstream in the RRO of the RSVP
   Resv message of the protected LSP.  Similarly, those procedures are
   used by the downstream PLR to signal the IPv4/IPv6 subobject flags
   downstream in the RRO of the RSVP Path message of the protected LSP.

4.5.  Bidirectional Bypass Tunnel Assignment Co-ordination

   This document defines signaling procedures and a new
   BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject in the RSVP RECORD_ROUTE Object (RRO)
   used to co-ordinate the bidirectional bypass tunnel assignment
   between the downstream and upstream PLRs.

4.5.1.  Bidirectional Bypass Tunnel Assignment Signaling Procedure

   It is desirable to coordinate the bidirectional bypass tunnel
   selected at the downstream and upstream PLRs so that the rerouted
   traffic flows on co-routed paths after FRR.  To achieve this, a new
   RSVP subobject is defined for RRO that identifies a bidirectional
   bypass tunnel that is assigned at a downstream PLR to protect a
   bidirectional LSP.

   When the procedures defined in this document are in use, the
   BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject MUST be added by each downstream PLR in
   the RSVP Path RRO message of the GMPLS signaled bidirectional
   protected LSP to record the downstream bidirectional bypass tunnel
   assignment.  This subobject is sent in the RSVP Path RRO message
   every time the downstream PLR assigns or updates the bypass tunnel
   assignment.  The downstream PLR can assign a bypass tunnel when
   processing the first Path message of the protected LSP, however, it
   can not update the forwarding plane until it receives the Resv
   message containing the downstream MP label.

   The upstream PLR (downstream MP) simply reflects the bypass tunnel
   assignment in the reverse direction.  The absence of
   BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject in RRO means that the relevant node or
   interface is not protected by a bidirectional bypass tunnel.  Hence,
   the upstream PLR need not assign a bypass tunnel in the reverse
   direction.

   When the BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject is added in the RRO:

 


Taillon et al.          Expires February 4, 2018                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft           FRR for TE GMPLS LSPs            August 3, 2017


   o  The IPv4 or IPv6 subobject containing Node-ID address MUST also be
      added [RFC4561].  The Node-ID address MUST match the source
      address of the bypass tunnel selected for this protected LSP.

   o  The BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject MUST be added immediately after
      the Node-ID address.

   o  The Label subobject MUST also be added [RFC3209].

   The rules for adding an IPv4 or IPv6 Interface address subobject and
   Unnumbered Interface ID subobject as specified in [RFC3209] and
   [RFC4090] are not modified by the above procedure.  The options
   specified in Section 6.1.3 in [RFC4990] are also applicable as long
   as above mentioned rules are followed when using the FRR procedures
   defined in this document.  

   An upstream PLR (downstream MP) SHOULD check all BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT
   subobjects in the Path RRO in order to assign a reverse bypass
   tunnel.  The upstream PLR that detects a BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject,
   selects a reverse bypass tunnel that terminates locally with the
   destination address and tunnel-ID from the subobject, and has a
   source address matching the Node-ID address.  The RRO can contain
   multiple addresses to identify a node, however, the upstream PLR
   relies on the Node-ID address preceding the BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT
   subobject for identifying the bypass tunnel.  If the bypass tunnel is
   not found, the upstream PLR SHOULD send a Notify message [RFC3473]
   with Error-code - FRR Bypass Assignment Error (value: TBA1) and Sub-
   code - Bypass Tunnel Not Found (value: TBA3) to the downstream PLR. 
   Upon receiving this error, the downstream PLR SHOULD remove the
   bypass tunnel assignment and select an alternate bypass tunnel if one
   available.  The RRO containing BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject(s) is then
   simply forwarded downstream in the RSVP Path message.

4.5.2.  One-to-one Bidirectional Bypass Tunnel Assignment

   The bidirectional bypass tunnel assignment co-ordination procedure
   defined in this document can be used for both facility backup
   described in Section 3.2 of [RFC4090] and one-to-one backup described
   in Section 3.1 of [RFC4090].  As specified in [RFC4090], Section 4.2,
   the DETOUR_OBJECT can be used in one-to-one backup method to identify
   the detour LSPs.  In one-to-one backup method, if the bypass tunnel
   is already in-use at the upstream PLR, it SHOULD send a Notify
   message [RFC3473] with Error-code - FRR Bypass Assignment Error
   (value: TBA1) and Sub-code - One-to-one Bypass Already In-use (value:
   TBA4) to the downstream PLR.  Upon receiving this error, the
   downstream PLR SHOULD remove the bypass tunnel assignment and select
   an alternate bypass tunnel if one available.

4.5.3.  Multiple Bidirectional Bypass Tunnel Assignments

   The upstream PLR may receive multiple bypass tunnel assignments for a
   protected LSP from different downstream PLRs.  The choice of a
   reverse bypass tunnel is based on the local policy on the upstream
   PLR.  Examples of such a policy could be to prefer link protection
   over node protection, or to prefer the bypass tunnel to the furthest
   upstream node.

   As shown in Example 1 and Example 2, for the protected bidirectional
   GMPLS LSP R4-R5-R6, the upstream PLR R6 receives multiple bypass
   tunnel assignments, one from downstream PLR R4 for node protection
   and one from downstream PLR R5 for link protection.  In Example 1, R6
   prefers the link protection bypass tunnel from downstream PLR R5
   whereas in Example 2, R6 prefers the node protection bypass tunnel
   from downstream PLR R4.

         Example 2: Node protection is preferred on downstream MP

   In both examples above, the upstream PLR SHOULD send a Notify message
   [RFC3473] with Error-code - FRR Bypass Assignment Error (value: TBA1)
   and Sub-code - Bypass Assignment Cannot Be Used (value: TBA2) to the
   downstream PLR to indicate that it cannot use the bypass tunnel
   assignment in the reverse direction.  Upon receiving this error, the

   downstream PLR MAY remove the bypass tunnel assignment and select an
   alternate bypass tunnel if one available.

   If multiple bypass tunnel assignments are present on the upstream PLR
   R6 at the time of a failure, any resulted asymmetry gets corrected
   using the re-coroute procedure after FRR as specified in Section
   5.2.2 of this document. 


5.  Fast Reroute For Bidirectional GMPLS LSPs with In-band Signaling

   When a bidirectional bypass tunnel is used, after a link failure,
   following procedure is followed when using the in-band signaling:

   o  The downstream PLR reroutes traffic and RSVP Path signaling over
      the bidirectional bypass tunnel using the procedures defined in
      [RFC4090].  

   o  Upstream PLR reroutes traffic upon detecting the link failure or
      upon receiving RSVP Path message over the bidirectional bypass
      tunnel.  

   o  Upstream PLR also reroutes RSVP Resv signaling after receiving
      RSVP Path message over the bidirectional bypass tunnel.  

   The above procedure allows both traffic and RSVP signaling to flow on
   symmetric paths in the forward and reverse directions of a protected
   bidirectional GMPLS LSP.  The following sections describe the
   handling for link protection and node protection bypass tunnels.

5.1.  Link Protection for Bidirectional GMPLS LSPs

   Consider the TE network shown in Figure 1.  Assume every link in the
   network is protected with a link protection bypass tunnel (e.g.,

   bypass tunnel T3).  For the protected co-routed bidirectional LSP
   whose head-end is on node R1 and tail-end is on node R6, each
   traversed node (a potential PLR) assigns a link protection co-routed
   bidirectional bypass tunnel. 

5.1.1.  Behavior After Link Failure

   Consider the link R3-R4 on the protected LSP path fails.  The
   downstream PLR R3 and upstream PLR R4 independently trigger fast
   reroute to redirect traffic onto bypass tunnel T3 in the forward and
   reverse directions.  The downstream PLR R3 also reroutes RSVP Path
   messages onto the bypass tunnel T3 using the procedures described in
   [RFC4090].  The upstream PLR R4 reroutes RSVP Resv messages onto the
   reverse bypass tunnel T3 upon receiving RSVP Path message over bypass
   tunnel T3.

5.1.2.  Revertive Behavior After Fast Reroute

   The revertive behavior defined in [RFC4090], Section 6.5.2, is
   applicable to the link protection of bidirectional GMPLS LSPs.  When
   using the local revertive mode, after the link R3-R4 (in Figure 1) is
   restored, following node behaviors apply:

   o  The downstream PLR R3 starts sending the Path messages and traffic
      flow of the protected LSP over the restored link and stops sending
      them over the bypass tunnel.

   o  The upstream PLR R4 starts sending the traffic flow of the
      protected LSP over the restored link and stops sending it over the
      bypass tunnel. 

   o  When upstream PLR R4 receives the protected LSP Path messages over
      the restored link, if not already done, it starts sending Resv
      messages and traffic flow of the protected LSP over the restored
      link and stops sending them over the bypass tunnel.

       Figure 2: Flow of RSVP signaling after link failure and FRR

   Consider the TE network shown in Figure 2.  Assume every link in the
   network is protected with a node protection bypass tunnel.  For the
   protected co-routed bidirectional LSP whose head-end is on node R1
   and tail-end is on node R6, each traversed node (a potential PLR)
   assigns a node protection co-routed bidirectional bypass tunnel. 

   The solution introduces two phases to invoking FRR procedures by the
   PLR after the link failure.  The first phase comprises of FRR
   procedures to fast reroute data traffic onto bypass tunnels in the
   forward and reverse directions.  The second phase re-coroutes the
   data and signaling in the forward and reverse directions after the
   first phase.

5.2.1.  Behavior After Link Failure

   Consider a link R3-R4 (in Figure 2) on the protected LSP path fails. 
   The downstream PLR R3 and upstream PLR R4 independently trigger fast
   reroute procedures to redirect traffic onto respective bypass tunnels
   T2 and T1 in the forward and reverse directions.  The downstream PLR
   R3 also reroutes RSVP Path messages over the bypass tunnel T2 using
   the procedures described in [RFC4090].  Note, at this point, node R4
   stops receiving RSVP Path refreshes for the protected bidirectional
   LSP while protected traffic continues to flow over bypass tunnels. 
   As node R4 does not receive Path messages, it does not reroute RSVP
   Resv messages over the reverse bypass tunnel.

5.2.2.  Behavior After Link Failure To Re-coroute

   The downstream MP R5 that receives rerouted protected LSP RSVP Path
   message through the bypass tunnel, in addition to the regular MP
   processing defined in [RFC4090], gets promoted to a Point of Remote
   Repair (PRR) role and performs the following actions to re-coroute
   signaling and data traffic over the same path in the reverse
   direction:

   o  Finds the bypass tunnel in the reverse direction that terminates
      on the downstream PLR R3.  Note: the downstream PLR R3's address
      can be extracted from the "IPV4 tunnel sender address" in the
      SENDER_TEMPLATE Object of the protected LSP (see [RFC4090],
      Section 6.1.1).

   o  If reverse bypass tunnel is found and the protected LSP traffic is

      not already rerouted over the found bypass tunnel T2, the PRR R5
      activates FRR reroute procedures to direct traffic over the found
      bypass tunnel T2 in the reverse direction.  In addition, the PRR
      R5 also reroutes RSVP Resv over the bypass tunnel T2 in the
      reverse direction.

   o  If reverse bypass tunnel is not found, the PRR R5 immediately
      tears down the protected LSP.

                  Protected LSP:  {R1-R2-R3-R4-R5-R6}
                  R3's Bypass T2: {R3-R5}

        Figure 3: Flow of RSVP signaling after FRR and re-coroute

   Figure 3 describes the path taken by the traffic and signaling after
   completing re-coroute of data and signaling in the forward and
   reverse paths described above.  Node R4 will stop receiving the Path
   and Resv messages and it will timeout the RSVP soft-state, however,
   this will not cause the LSP to be torn down.  RSVP signaling at node
   R2 is not affected by the FRR and re-corouting.

   If downstream MP R5 receives multiple RSVP Path messages through
   multiple bypass tunnels (e.g., as a result of multiple failures), the
   PRR SHOULD identify a bypass tunnel that terminates on the farthest
   downstream PLR along the protected LSP path (closest to the protected
   bidirectional LSP head-end) and activate the reroute procedures
   mentioned above.

5.2.2.1.  Re-coroute in Data-plane After Link Failure

   The downstream MP (upstream PLR) MAY optionally support re-corouting
   in data-plane as follows.  If the downstream MP has assigned a
   bidirectional bypass tunnel, as soon as the downstream MP receives
   the protected LSP packets on the bypass tunnel, it MAY switch the
   upstream traffic on to the bypass tunnel.  In order to identify the
   protected LSP packets through the bypass tunnel, Penultimate Hop
   Popping (PHP) of the bypass tunnel MUST be disabled.  The downstream
   MP checks whether the protected LSP signaling is rerouted over the
   found bypass tunnel, and if not, it performs the signaling procedure

   described in Section 5.2.2 of this document.

5.2.3.  Revertive Behavior After Fast Reroute

   The revertive behavior defined in [RFC4090], Section 6.5.2, is
   applicable to the node protection of bidirectional GMPLS LSPs.  When
   using the local revertive mode, after the link R3-R4 (in Figures 2
   and 3) is restored, following node behaviors apply: 

   o  The downstream PLR R3 starts sending the Path messages and traffic
      flow of the protected LSP over the restored link and stops sending
      them over the bypass tunnel.

   o  The upstream PLR R4 starts sending the traffic flow of the
      protected LSP over the restored link towards downstream PLR R3 and
      forwarding the Path messages towards PRR R5 and stops sending the
      traffic over the bypass tunnel.

   o  When upstream PLR R4 receives the protected LSP Path messages over
      the restored link, if not already done, it starts sending Resv
      messages and traffic flow over the restored link towards
      downstream PLR R3 and forwarding the Path messages towards PRR R5
      and stops sending them over the bypass tunnel.

   o  When PRR R5 receives the protected LSP Path messages over the
      restored path, it starts sending Resv messages and traffic flow
      over the restored path and stops sending them over the bypass
      tunnel.

5.3.  Unidirectional Link Failures

   Unidirectional link failures can result in the traffic flowing on
   asymmetric paths in the forward and reverse directions.  In addition,
   unidirectional link failures can cause RSVP soft-state timeout in the
   control-plane in some cases.  As an example, if the unidirectional
   link failure is in the upstream direction (from R4 to R3 in Figures 1
   and 2), the downstream PLR (node R3) can stop receiving the Resv
   messages of the protected LSP from the upstream PLR (node R4 in
   Figures 1 and 2) and this can cause RSVP soft-state timeout to occur
   on the downstream PLR (node R3).

   A unidirectional link failure in the downstream direction (from R3 to
   R4 in Figures 1 and 2), does not cause RSVP soft-state timeout when
   using the FRR procedures defined in this document, since the upstream
   PLR (node R4 in Figure 1 and node R5 in Figure 2) triggers the
   re-coroute procedure (defined in Section 5.2.2 of this document)
   after receiving RSVP Path messages of the protected LSP over the
   bypass tunnel from the downstream PLR (node R3 in Figures 1 and 2).

6.  Fast Reroute For Bidirectional GMPLS LSPs with Out-of-band Signaling

   When using the GMPLS out-of-band signaling [RFC3473], after a link
   failure event, the RSVP messages are not rerouted over the
   bidirectional bypass tunnel by the downstream and upstream PLRs but
   instead rerouted over the control-channels to the downstream and
   upstream MPs, respectively.

   The RSVP soft-state timeout after FRR as described in Section 5.2 of
   this document is equally applicable to the GMPLS out-of-band
   signaling as the RSVP signaling refreshes can stop reaching certain
   nodes along the protected LSP path after the downstream and upstream
   PLRs finish rerouting of the signaling messages.  However, unlike
   with the in-band signaling, unidirectional link failures as described
   in Section 5.3 of this document do not result in soft-state timeout
   with GMPLS out-of-band signaling.  Apart from this, the FRR procedure
   described in Section 5 of this document is equally applicable to the
   GMPLS out-of-band signaling.


7.  Message and Object Definitions

7.1.  BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT Subobject

   The BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject is used to inform the downstream MP
   of the bypass tunnel being assigned by the PLR.  This can be used to
   coordinate the bypass tunnel assignment for the protected LSP by the
   downstream and upstream PLRs in the forward and reverse directions
   respectively prior or after the failure occurrence.  

   This subobject SHOULD be inserted into the Path RRO by the downstream
   PLR.  It SHOULD NOT be inserted into an RRO by a node which is not a
   downstream PLR.  It MUST NOT be changed by downstream LSRs and MUST
   NOT be added to a Resv RRO.

   The BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT IPv4 subobject in RRO has the following format:

        0                   1                   2                   3

         The bypass tunnel IPv6 destination address.


7.2.  FRR Bypass Assignment Error Notify Message

   New Error-code - FRR Bypass Assignment Error (value: TBA1) and its
   sub-codes are defined for the ERROR_SPEC Object (C-Type 6) [RFC2205]
   in this document, that is carried by the Notify message (Type 21)
   defined in [RFC3473] Section 4.3.  This Error message is sent by the
   upstream PLR to the downstream PLR to notify a bypass assignment
   error.  In the Notify message, the IP destination address is set to
   the node address of the downstream PLR that had initiated the bypass
   assignment.  In the ERROR_SPEC Object, IP address is set to the node
   address of the upstream PLR that detected the bypass assignment
   error.  This Error MUST NOT be sent in a Path Error message.  This
   Error does not cause the protected LSP to be torn down.


8.  Compatibility

   New RSVP subobject BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT is defined for RECORD_ROUTE
   Object in this document that is carried in the RSVP Path message. 
   Per [RFC3209], nodes not supporting this subobject will ignore the
   subobject but forward it without modification.  As described in
   Section 7 of this document, this subobject is not carried in the RSVP
   Resv message and is ignored by sending the Notify message for FRR
   Bypass Assignment Error (with Subcode: Bypass Assignment Cannot Be
   Used) defined in this document.  Nodes not supporting the Notify
   message defined in this document will ignore it but forward it
   without modification.


9.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces a new BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject for the
   RECORD_ROUTE Object that is carried in an RSVP signaling message. 
   Thus in the event of the interception of a signaling message, more
   information about LSP's fast reroute protection can be deduced than
   was previously the case.  This is judged to be a very minor security
   risk as this information is already available by other means.  If a
   MP does not find a matching bypass tunnel with given source and
   destination addresses locally, it ignores the BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT
   subobject.  Due to this, security risk introduced by inserting a
   random address in this subobject is minimal.  The Notify message for
   FRR Bypass Assignment Error defined in this document does not result
   in tear-down of the protected LSP and is not service affecting.

   are covered in [RFC3209] and [RFC3473].  Further, general
   considerations for securing RSVP-TE in MPLS-TE and GMPLS networks can
   be found in [RFC5920].  This document updates the mechanisms defined
   in [RFC4090], which also discusses related security measures and are
   also applicable to this document.  As specified in [RFC4090], a PLR
   and its selected merge point trust RSVP messages received from each
   other.  The security considerations pertaining to the original RSVP
   protocol [RFC2205] also remain relevant to the updates in this
   document.


10.  IANA Considerations

10.1.  BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT Subobject 

   IANA manages the "RSVP PARAMETERS" registry located at
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/rsvp-parameters>.  IANA is requested
   to assign a value for the new BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject in the
   "Class Type 21 ROUTE_RECORD - Type 1 Route Record" registry. 

   This document introduces a new subobject for RECORD_ROUTE Object:

10.2.  FRR Bypass Assignment Error Notify Message

   IANA maintains the "Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Parameters"
   registry (see <http://www.iana.org/assignments/rsvp-parameters>). 
   The "Error Codes and Globally-Defined Error Value Sub-Codes"
   subregistry is included in this registry.

   This registry has been extended for the new Error-code and Sub-codes
   defined in this document as follows:

   o  Error-code TBA1: FRR Bypass Assignment Error 

   o  Sub-code TBA2: Bypass Assignment Cannot Be Used
