Abstract

   In the decade since [RFC6125] was published, the subjectAltName
   extension, as defined in [RFC5280] has become ubiquitous.  This
   document updates [RFC6125] to specify that the fall-back techniques
   of using commonName attribute to identify the service MUST NOT be
   used.

1.  Introduction

   In the decade since [RFC6125] was published, the subjectAltName
   extension, as defined in [RFC5280] has become ubiquitous.  This
   document updates [RFC6125] to specify that the fall-back techniques
   of using commonName attribute to identify the service MUST NOT be
   used.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The terminology from [RFC6125] is used here.  Specifically, the
   following terms and brief definition (as a reminder):

   *  CN-ID: the Common Name element from a Distingiushed Name.

   *  DNS-ID, SRV-ID, URI-ID: different types of entries in a
      subjectAltName extension.

3.  The New Rules

   The CN-ID MUST NOT be used.  The appropriate value in the
   subjectAltName extension MUST be used to get the presented identity
   of the server.

   While not discussed in [RFC6125], this section also implicitly
   prohibits the use of the Domain Component or emailAddress RDN's.

   The following sections repeat the above rule in other forms, for the
   purpose of updating [RFC6125].

3.1.  Designing Application Protocols

   Applications should determine which form of name they want to use,
   and specify the appropriate subjectAltName extension.  Unless there
   are reasons to do otherwise, applications SHOULD use the DNS-ID form.

3.2.  Representing Server Identity

   Severs either MUST NOT issue a CN-ID, or MUST use a form for the
   Common Name RDN that cannot be mistaken for an identifier.  Not using
   Common Name is preferred.

3.3.  Verifying Service Identity

   When constructing a list of reference identifiers, the client MUST
   NOT include any CN-ID present in the certificate.  This means that
   section 6.4.4 of [RFC6125] MUST be ignored.

4.  Constraints on Wildcards

   Wildcard certificates are discussed in section 7.2 of [RFC6125],
   which says that the specifications "are not clear or consistent"
   about where a wildcard can appear.

   This documents specifies that a wildcard can appear

   *  only as the left-most label; or

   *  as the last character in a left-most label

5.  Security Considerations

   The CN-ID, domainComponent, and emailAddress RDN fields are
   unstructured free text, and using them is dependant on ordering and
   encoding concerns.  In addition, their evaluation when PKIX
   nameConstraints are present is ambiguous.  This document removes
   those fields from use, so a source of possible errors is removed.

   Because of the ambiguity around wildcards, [RFC6125] mentions that it
   is possible to have exploitable differences in behavior.  By
   simplifying those practices to one rule, this source of errors should
   be avoided.

   All other security considerations of [RFC6125] and its dependant
   documents are still relevant.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
