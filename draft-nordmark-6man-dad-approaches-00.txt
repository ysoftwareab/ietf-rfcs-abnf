Internet-Draft               DAD approaches                   March 2015


1.  Introduction

   Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) is a procedure in IPv6 performed on
   an address before it can be assigned to an interface [RFC2462].  By
   default it consists of sending a single multicast Neighbor
   Soliciation message and waiting for a response for one second.  If no
   response is received, the address is declared to not be a duplicate.
   Once the address has been tested once, there is no further attempts
   to check for duplicates (unless the interface is re-initialized).

   The companion document [I-D.yourtchenko-6man-dad-issues] outlines a
   set of issues around Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) which either
   result in reduced robustness, or result in lower efficiency for
   either the hosts wanting to sleep or the network handling more
   multicast packets.

   The reader is encourage to review the issues in that document.  In
   summary, the lack of robustness is due to only sending one or a few
   DAD probe initially, and not having any positive acknowledgement that
   "there are no duplicates".  This implies that partioned links that
   later heal can result in persistent undetected duplicate IPv6
   addresses, including cases of "local partitions" such as the case of
   a modem not having connected when the DAD probes are sent.  The
   inefficiences appears when there are low-powered devices on the link
   that wish to sleep a significant amount of time.  Such devices must
   either be woken up by multicast Neighbor Soliciations sent to one of
   their solicited-node multicast addresses, or they need to redo DAD
   each time they wake up from sleep.  Both drain the battery; the
   second one results in sending a DAD probe and then waiting for a
   second with the radion receiver enabled to see if a DAD message
   indicates a duplicate.


2.  Robustness Solution Approaches

   IPv4 ARP robustness against partitions and joins is greately improved
   by Address Conflict Detection (ACD) [RFC5227].  That approach is
   leverages the fact that ARP requests are broadcast on the link and
   also makes the ARP replies be broadcast on the link.  That
   combination means that a host can immediately detect when some other
   host provides a different MAC address for what the host thinks is its
   own IPv4 address.  That is coupled with state machines and logic for
   determining whether to try to reclaim the address or give up and let
   the other host have it.  When giving up the host will form a new IPv4
   address.  The ACD approach results in more broadcast traffic than
   normal ARP [RFC0826] since the ARP replies are broadcast.

   Applying the same approach to IPv6 would require sending the Neighbor

   Solicitations and Neighbor Advertisements to the all-nodes multicast
   address so that a host can see when a different host is claiming/
   using the same source IPv6 address.  That would remove the efficiency
   that Neighbor Discovery gets from "spreading" the resolution traffic
   over 4 million multicast addresses.

   One can envision variants on the theme of ACD that fit better with
   the use of solicited-node multicast addresses.  Suppose we have Host1
   with IP1 that hashes to solicited-node multicast address SN1.  And we
   also have Host2 with IP2 and SN2.The link-layer addresses are MAC1
   and MAC2, respectively.  In [RFC4861] when Host1 wants to communicate
   with Host2 we will see
   1.  Host1 multicasts a NS from IP1 to SN2.  That include a claim for
       IP1->MAC1 using the Source Link-layer Address option.
   2.  Host2 receives the NA and unicasts a NA from IP2 to IP1.  That
       includes a claim for IP2->MAC using the Taget Link-layer Address
       option.

   If we want other hosts which might think they own either IP1 or IP2
   to see the NA or NS (and we don't want to send the NS and NA to all-
   nodes), then we can add additional multicast packets which explicitly
   send the claim and send it to the Solicited-node multicast address of
   the address that is being claimed.  Thus
   1.  Host1 multicasts a NS from IP1 to SN2.  That include a claim for
       IP1->MAC1 using the Source Link-layer Address option.
   2.  Host1 multicasts a NA from IP1 to SN1 explicitly claiming
       IP1->MAC1 using the TLLAO.
   3.  Host2 receives the NA and unicasts a NA from IP2 to IP1.  That
       includes a claim for IP2->MAC using the Taget Link-layer Address
       option.
   4.  Host2 multicasts a NA from IP2 to SN2 explicitly claiming
       IP2->MAC2 using the TLLAO.

   The above explicit claims can then trigger the state machine
   described in ACD.  The claims can probably be rate limited for any
   given source address since there is no need to repeat the claim just
   because a NS needs to be sent for a new IP3 etc.  The impact of such
   rate limitig on the ability to detect duplicates.

   In the worst case the above approach turns one multicast and one
   unicast into three multicasts and one unicast, but all the multicasts
   are sent to solicited-node multicast addresss.  Thus a host would not
   need to process the additional multicast packets.

   This ACD-multicast approach assumes that the multicast packets are
   delivered with reasonable reliability, but does not assume any
   perfect delivery.  If multicast reliability is lower than unicast it
   will result in retransmitted multicast NS in [RFC4861].  However, the

   above rate limiting idea might need care to ensure that claims are
   re-transmitted when the NS is re-transmitted.


3.  Approaches to efficiency

   There exists some form of sleep proxies
   [ECMA-393][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonjour_Sleep_Proxy] which
   perform handover of Neighbor Discovery protocol processing.  [ECMA-
   393] does not specify the handover mechanism, and there is no know
   dcumentation for the handover mechanism.  Even though the details are
   not specified, the approach seems to allow a host to sleep without
   worrying about DAD; the sleep proxy will respond to DAD probes.  This
   seems to entail sending multicast NAs to all-nodes to hand-over the
   IP address to the proxy's MAC address before going to sleep and then
   again to hand it back to the host's MAC address when it wakes up.

   It is not clear whether such sleep proxies provide protection against
   Single Points of Failure i.e., whether the host can hand over things
   to a pair of sleep proxies.

   FCFS SAVI [RFC6620] builds up state in devices to be able to detect
   and prevent when some host is trying to use an IPv6 address already
   used by another host on the link.  This binding is built and checked
   for DAD packets, but also for data packets to ensure that an attacker
   can not inject a data packet with somebody elses source address.
   When FCFS SAVI detects a potential problem it checks whether the IPv6
   address has merely moved to a different binding anchor (e.g., port on
   the switch) by sending a probe to its old anchor.  Thus it assumes
   the host is always awake or can be awoken to answer that probe.
   Futhermore, implementation of the data triggered aspects can run into
   hardware limitations since it requires something like an ACL for
   every IPv6 address which has been validated.

   DAD proxies as specified in [RFC6957] was designed to handle split-
   horizon forwarding which means that a host would never receive a
   multicast DAD probe sent by another host.  This approach maintains a
   binding cache built up by DAD probes and checked when handling DAD
   probes.  However, just like SAVI in order to handle host mobility and
   legitimate host MAC address change, it the case of a potential
   conflict the proxy ends up verifying whether the IP address is still
   present at its old port and MAC address.  Hence the host can not
   sleep.

   One could explore something along the SAVI and DAD proxie approach
   that uses timestamps to allow better sleep.  In principle would could
   start some fixed timer each time an IPv6 address is added or updated
   in the binding cache, and during that time the proxy would respond to

Internet-Draft               DAD approaches                   March 2015


   DAD probes on behalf of the (potentially sleeping) host.  To enable
   movement between ports/anchors such an approach would have to compare
   MAC address and assume that if the MAC address is the same it is the
   same host.  (Unclear whether that is a good idea if we end up with
   random MAC addresses for better privacy.)  And if a host would like
   to change its MAC address it would need to wait for the timeout
   before it can succeed in doing the change.  Thus on one hand one
   would want a long time (24 hours?) to facilitate for sleeping hosts,
   and on the other hand a short time to allow for MAC address change
   and movement.

   In essence the above forms an implicit request for the proxy to
   handle DAD on behalf of the host, with a fixed time limit.  If the
   host can instead make that time explicit, then the host can also
   remove the proxy behavior (by passing a time of zero).  Such a "proxy
   for me" request can leverage the ARO option defined for 6LoWPan in
   [RFC6775] but use it only for the purposes of DAD offload to the
   proxy.  That option can also carry an additional identifier which can
   be used to distinguish between the same host aka same identifier
   changing the MAC address.  In the RFC that is an EUI-64 and in
   [I-D.chakrabarti-nordmark-energy-aware-nd] in is a more generalized
   identifier field.  For redundancy the ARO can be sent to more than
   one proxy.


4.  Security Considerations

   If the working group decides to pursue one of the outlined approaches
   to improve the robustness and/or efficiency of DAD, then the security
   issues for that partiticular approach will need to be studied.

   In general DAD is subject to a Denial of Service attack since a
   malicious host can claim all the IPv6 addresses [RFC4218].
