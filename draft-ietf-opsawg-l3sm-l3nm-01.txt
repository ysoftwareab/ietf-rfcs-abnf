                    A Layer 3 VPN Network YANG Model
                     draft-ietf-opsawg-l3sm-l3nm-01

Abstract

   RFC8299 defines a L3VPN Service YANG data Model (L3SM) that can be
   used for communication between customers and VPN service providers.
   That data model plays the role of a Customer Service Model, according
   to the terminology defined in RFC8309, and is as such adequate for
   service negotiation and order handling matters.

   There is a need for a more network-centric YANG data model to be used
   in the communication between the entity that interacts directly with
   the customer, the service orchestrator, (either fully automated or a
   human operator) and the entity in charge of network orchestration and
   control (a.k.a., network controller/orchestrator).

   This document specifies a L3VPN Network YANG Model (L3NM) to
   facilitate communication between a service orchestrator and a network
   controller/orchestrator.  Such data model provides a network-centric
   view of the L3VPN services.  The Yang model proposed is limited to
   BGP PE-based VPNs as described in RFCs 4026, 4110, and 4364.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8299] defines an L3VPN Service YANG data Model (L3SM) that can be
   used for communication between customers and network operators.  Such
   model is focused on describing the customer view of the VPN services,
   and provides an abstracted view of the customer's requested services.
   That aproach limits the usage of the L3SM module to the role of a
   Customer Service Model, according to the terminology defined in
   [RFC8309].

   The YANG data model defined in this document is called L3VPN Network
   Model (L3NM).  The L3NM module is aimed at providing a network-
   centric view of L3 VPN Services.  The data model can be used to
   facilitate communication between the service orchestrator (or a
   network operator) and the network controller/orchestrator by allowing
   for more network-centric information to be included.  It enables
   further capabilities, such as resource management or to serve as a
   multi-domain orchestration interface, where logical resources (such
   as route targets or route distinguishers) must be synchronized.

   This document does not obsolete, but uses, the definitions in
   [RFC8299].  These two modules are used for similar objectives but
   with differents scopes and views.

   The L3NM YANG module is initially built with a prune and extend
   approach, taking as a starting points the YANG module described in
   [RFC8299].  Nevertheless, this module is not defined as an augment to
   L3SM because a specific structure is required to meet network-
   oriented L3 needs.

   Some of the information captured in the L3SM can be passed by the
   Orchestrator in the L3NM (e.g., customer) or be used to fed some of
   the L3NM attribute (e.g., actual forwarding policies).  Some of the
   information captured in L3SM may be maintained locally within the
   Orchestrator; which is supposed to maintain a "glue" between a
   Customer view and its network instantiation.

   The L3NM module does not attempt to address all deployment cases
   especially those where the L3VPN connectivity is supported through
   the coordination of different VPNs in different underlying networks.
   More complex deployment scenarios involving the coordination of
   different VPN instances and different technologies to provide end-to-
   end VPN connectivity are addressed by a complementary YANG model
   defined in [I-D.evenwu-opsawg-yang-composed-vpn].

1.1.  Terminology

   This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the contents
   of [RFC6241], [RFC7950], [RFC8299], [RFC8309], and [RFC8453] and uses
   the terminology defined in those documents.

   The meaning of the symbols in tree diagrams is defined in in
   [RFC8340].

   The document is aimed at modeling BGP PE-based VPNs in a Service
   Provider Network, so the terms defined in [RFC4026] and [RFC4076] are
   used.

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   o  L3 VPN Customer Service Model (L3SM): Describes the requirements
      of a L3 VPN that interconnects a set of sites from the point of
      view of the customer.  The customer service model does not provide
      details on the Service Provider Network.  The L3 VPN Customer
      Service model is defined in [RFC8299].

   o  L3 VPN Service Network Model (L3NM): A YANG module that describes
      a VPN Service in the Service Provider Network.  It containts
      information of the Service Provider network and might include
      allocated resources.  It can be used by network controllers to
      manage and control the VPN Service configuration in the Service

      Provider network.  The YANG module can be consumed by a Service
      Orchestrator to request a VPN Service to a Network controller.

   o  Service Orchestrator: A functional entity that interacts with the
      customer of a L3 VPN.  The Service Orchestrator interacts with the
      customer using L3SM.  The Service Orchestrator is responsible of
      the CE-PE attachment circuits, the PE selection, and requesting
      the VPN service to the network controller.

   o  Network Controller: A functional entity responsible for the
      control and management of the service provider network.

   o  VPN node (vpn-node): An abstraction that represents a set of
      policies applied to a PE and that belong to a single VPN service
      (vpn-service).  A vpn-service involves one or more vpn-nodes.  As
      it is an abstraction, the network controller will take on how to
      implement a vpn-node.  For example, typically, in a BGP-based VPN,
      a vpn-node could be mapped into a VRF.

   o  VPN network access (vpn-network-access): An abstraction that
      represents the network interfaces that are associated to a given
      vpn-node.  Traffic coming from the vpn-network-access belongs to
      the VPN.  The attachment circuits (bearers) between CEs and PEs
      are terminated in the vpn-network-access.  A reference to the
      bearer is maintained to allow keeping the link between L3SM and
      L3NM.

   o  VPN Site (vpn-site): A VPN customer's location that is connected
      to the Service Provider network via a CE-PE link, which can access
      at least one VPN [RFC4176].

   o  VPN Service Provider (SP): A Service Provider offers VPN-related
      services [RFC4176].

   o  Service Provider (SP) Network: A network able to provide VPN-
      related services.

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Reference Architecture

   Figure 1 depices the reference architecture for L3NM.  The figure is
   an expansion of the architecture presented in Section 5 of [RFC8299]
   and decomposes the box marked "orchestration" in that figure into
   three separate functional components called "Service Orchestration",
   "Network Orchestration", and "Domain Orchestration".

   Although some deployments may choose to construct a monolithic
   orchestration component (covering both service and network matters),
   this document advocates for a clear separation between service and
   network orchestration components for the sake of better flexibility.
   Such design adheres to the L3VPN reference architecture defined in
   Section 1.3 of [RFC4176].  The above separation relies upon a
   dediciated communication interface between these components and
   appropriate YANG module that reflect network-related information
   (that is hidden to customers).

   The intelligence for translating customer-facing information into
   network-centric one is implementation-specific.

   The terminology from [RFC8309] is introduced to show the distinction
   between the "Customer Service Model", the "Service Delivery Model",
   the "Network Configuration Model", and the "Device Configuration
   Model".  In that context, the "Domain Orchestration" and "Config
   Manager" roles may be performed by "Controllers".

3.  Description of the L3NM YANG Module

   The L3NM module ('ietf-l3vpn-ntw') is meant to manage L3 VPNs in a
   service provider network.  In particular, the 'ietf-l3vpn-ntw' module
   can be used to create, modify, and retrieve L3VPN Services of a
   network.

3.1.  Structure of the Module

   The 'ietf-l3vpn-ntw' module uses two main containers: 'vpn-services'
   and 'vpn-profiles' (see Figure 3).  The 'vpn-services' container
   maintains the set of VPN Services managed in the service provider
   network.  The module allows to create a new VPN service by adding a
   new instance of 'vpn-service'.  The 'vpn-service' is the data
   structure that abstracts the VPN Service.

   The 'vpn-profiles' container allows the provider to maintain a set of
   commmon VPN profiles that apply to several VPN Services.

                                 Figure 3

3.2.  Modeling a L3 VPN Service

   The 'vpn-service' is the data structure that abstracts a VPN Service
   in the Service Provider Network.  Every 'vpn-service' has a unique
   identifier: vpn-id.  Such vpn-id is only meaningful locally within
   the Network controller.  In order to facilitate the recognition of
   the service, a 'customer-name' and a 'description' may be included.
   The topology of the VPN service is expressed in the 'vpn-service-
   topology' leaf.

   A VPN Service is built by adding instances of 'vpn-node' to the 'vpn-
   nodes' container.  The 'vpn-node' is an abstractions that represent a
   set of policies applied to a network node and that belong to a single
   'vpn-service'.  A 'vpn-node' contains 'vpn_network_accesses', which
   are the interfaces involved in the creation of the VPN.  The customer
   sites are connected to the 'vpn_network_accesses'.  Note that, as
   this is a network data model, the information about customers site is
   not needed.  Such information, is relevant in the L3SM model.

3.2.1.  VPN node

   The 'vpn-node' is an abstraction that represents a set of common
   policies applied in a given network node (tipcally a PE) and belong
   to one L3 VPN Service.  In order to indicate the network node where
   the 'vpn-node' applies the the ne-id MUST be facilitated.  The 'vpn-
   node' includes a parameter to indicate in which network node it is
   applied.  In the case that the ne-id points to a specific PE, the
   vpn_node will likely be mapped into a vrf in the node.  However, the
   model also allows to point to an abstract node.  In this case, the
   network controller will decide how to split the vpn_node into vrfs.
   For the cases the logical resources are managed outside the network
   controller, the model allows to explicitely indicate the logical
   resources such as Route targets and Route distinguishers (RT,RD).

   Under the VPN Node container, VPN Network Acesses can be created.
   The VPN Network Acess represents the point to which sites are
   connected.  Note that, unlike in L3SM, the L3NM does not need to
   model the customer site, only the points where the traffic from the
   site are received.  Hence, the VPN Network access contains the
   connectivity information between the provider's Network and the
   customer premises.  The VPN profiles have a set of routing policies
   than can be applied during the service creation.

3.2.1.1.  VPN Network Access

   A 'vpn-network-access' represents an entry point to a VPN service.
   In other words, this container encloses the parameters that describe
   the access information for the traffic that belongs to a particular
   L3 VPN.  As such, every vpn-network-access belongs to one and only
   one vpn-node.  As an example, a vpn-network-access includes
   information such as the connection on which the access is defined
   (see the section below), the encapsulation of the traffic, policies
   that are applied on the access, etc.

   A provisioning network controller (PNC) [RFC8453] will accept VPN
   requests containing this construct, using the enclosed data to:
   configure the router's interface to include the parameters described
   at the vpn-network-access, include the given interface into a VRF,
   configuring policies or schedulers for the incoming traffic, etc.

3.2.1.1.1.  Connection

   The definition of a L3VPN is commonly specified not only at the IP
   layer, but also requires to identify parameters at the Ethernet
   layer, such as encapsulation type (e.g., VLAN, QinQ, QinAny, VxLAN,
   etc.).  The 'connection' container represents and groups the set of
   L2 connectivity from where the traffic of the L3VPN in a particular
   VPN Network access is coming.

   Additionally, the bearer-reference (Section 3.2.1.1.1.3) and the
   pseudowire termination (Section 3.2.1.1.1.2) is supported.

3.2.1.1.1.1.  Encapsulation options

   Ethernet encapsulation description is not supported in [RFC8299].
   However, this parameters are mandatory to configure the PE
   interfaces.  Thus, In the L3NM, these parameters uses the connection
   container inside the vpn-network-access.  This container defines
   protocols and parameters to enable connectivity at Layer 2.

3.2.1.1.1.2.  Remote Far End Configuration

   Depending on the control plane implementation, different network
   scenarios might require additional information for the L3VPN service
   to be configured and active.  For example, an L3VPN Option C service,
   if no reflection of IPv4 VPN routes is configured via ASBR or route
   reflector, may require additional configuration (e.g. a new BGP
   neighbor) to be coordinated between both management systems.  This
   definition requires for every management system participant in the
   VPN to receive not just their own sites and site-network-accesses,
   but also to receive information about external ones, identified as an
   external site-network-access-type.  In addition, this particular
   site-network-access is augmented to include the loopback address of
   the far-end (remote/external) PE router.

3.2.1.1.1.3.  Bearers

   A site, as per [RFC4176] represents a VPN customer's location that is
   connected to the Service Provider network via a CE-PE link, which can
   access at least one VPN.  The connection from the site to the Service
   Provider network is the bearer.  Every site is associated with a list
   of bearers.  A bearer is the layer two connections with the site.  In
   the module it is assumed that the bearer has been allocated by the
   Service Provider at the service orchestration step.  The bearer is
   associated to a network element and a port.  Hence, a bearer is just
   a bearer-reference to allow the translation between L3SM and L3NM.

3.2.1.1.2.  IP Connection

   IP Connection container has the parameters of the vpn-network-access
   addressing information.  The address allocated in this container
   would represent the PE interface address configuration.  The IP
   Connection container is designed to support dual stack (IPv4/IPv6)
   and three options to set the ip address: Provider DHCP, DHCP relay or
   static addressing.

   In the case of the static addressing the model supports the
   assignation of several IP addresses in the same vpn-network-access.
   To identify which of the addresses is the primary address of the
   connection the "primary-address" reference must be set with the
   corresponding address-id.

3.2.1.1.3.  Routing Protocols

   The model allows the Network Operator to configure one or more
   routing protocols associated with a particular vpn-network-access.
   This protocol will run between the PE and the CE.  A routing protocol
   instance MUST have a type (e.g. bgp, ospf, etc.) and an identifier.
   The identifier is necessary when multiple instances of the same
   protocol need to be configured.

   The model uses an abstracted view of routing protocols.  When
   configuring multiple instances of the same protocol, this does not
   automatically imply that, from a device configuration perspective,
   there will be parallel instances (multiple processes) running.  It
   will be up to the implementation to use the most appropriate
   deployment model.  As an example, when multiple BGP peers need to be
   implemented, multiple instances of BGP must be configured as part of
   this model.  However from a device configuration point of view, this
   could be implemented as:

   o  Multiple BGP processes with a single neighbor running in each
      process.

   o  A single BGP process with multiple neighbors running.

   o  A combination of both.

   To be aligned with [RFC8299], this model supports the following
   protocols:

   o  vrrp: takes only a list of address-family as parameter.  VRRP
      instance is expected to run on the vpn-network-access interface.

   o  rip: takes only a list of address-family as parameter.  RIP
      instance is expected to run on the vpn-network-access interface.

   o  static: allows user to configure one or more IPv4 and IPv6 static
      routes.

   o  bgp: allows the user to configure a BGP neighbor including
      parameters like authentication using a key.  The authentication
      type will be driven by the implementation but the model supports
      any authentication that uses a key as a parameter.  A BGP neighbor
      can support ipv4, ipv6, or both address-families.  Again, it is up
      to the implementation to drive the device configuration (e.g.
      separate BGP sessions for Dual Stack, single session for Dual
      Stack, etc.).

   o  ospf: allows the user to configure OSPF to run on the vpn-network-
      access interface.  An OSPF instance can run ipv4, ipv6 or both.
      When only ipv4 address-family is requested, it will be up to the
      implementation to drive if OSPFv2 or v3 is used.

   Routing protocol configuration do not have any routing policy
   configuration.  Routing policies are low level device configurations
   that must not be part of an abstracted model.  Service Provider
   internal policies (such as security filters) will be implemented as
   part of the device configuration but does not require any input from
   this model.  Some policies like primary/backup, load-balancing can be
   inferred from access-priority.

3.2.2.  Concept of Import/Export Profiles

   The import and export profiles construct contains a list with
   information related with route target and distinguishers (RTs and
   RDs), grouped and identified by ie-profile-id.  The identifier is
   then referenced in one or multiple vpn-nodes, so the PNC can identify
   RTs and RDs to be configured in the VRF.

3.2.3.  Multicast

   Multicast can be optionally enabled for a particular vpn-network-
   access.

   The model supports a single type of tree (ASM, SSM or bidirectional).

   When ASM is used, the model supports configuration of rendez-vous
   points.  RP discovery could be static, bsr-rp or auto-rp.  When
   static is used RP to multicast grouping mapping must be configured as
   part of the rp-group-mappings container.  The RP may be a provider
   node or a customer node.  When the RP is a customer node, the RP
   address must be configured using the rp-address leaf otherwise no RP
   address is needed.  The model supports RP redundancy through the rp-
   redundancy leaf.  How the redundancy is achieved is out of scope and
   is up to the implementation.  When a particular VPN using ASM
   requires a more optimal traffic delivery, the leaf optimal-traffic-
   delivery can be used.  When set to true, the implementation must use
   any mechanism to provide a more optimal traffic delivery for the
   customer.  As an example, the implementation can use RP tree to
   Shortest Path tree switchover or simply deploy additional RPs working
   in an anycast mode.

3.3.  VPN profiles

   The vpn-profiles containers allow the network operator to maintain a
   set of commmon VPN Profiles that apply to several VPN Services.
   Through this container these common profiles can be created, modified
   and deleted.

4.  Use of the Data Model

4.1.  Multi-Domain Resource Management

   The implementation of L3VPN services which span across
   administratively separated domains (i.e., that are under the
   administration of different management systems or controllers)
   requires some network resources to be synchronized between systems.
   Particularly, there are two resources that must be orchestrated and
   manage to avoid asymmetric (non-functional) configuration, or the
   usage of unavailable resources.  For example, RTs shall be
   synchronized between PEs.  When every PE is controlled by the same
   management system, RT allocation can be performed by the system.  In
   cases where the service spans across multiple management systems,
   this task of allocating RTs has to be aligned across the domains,
   therefore, the service model must provide a way to specify RTs.  In
   addition, RDs must also be synchronized to avoid collisions in RD
   allocation between separate systems.  An incorrect allocation might
   lead to the same RD and IP prefixes being exported by different PE
   routers.

5.  Relation with other Yang Models

   The L3NM model, aimed at managing the L3VPN Services in a Service
   Provider Network controller/orchestrator has relations with other
   Yang modules.

5.1.  Relation with L3SM

   [RFC8299] defines a L3VPN Service YANG data Model (L3SM) that can be
   used for communication between customers and VPN service providers.
   Hence, the model provides inputs to the Network Operator to deliver
   such service to the customer.  Hence, some parts of the model can be
   directly mapped into L3NM.

   o  Routing protocols requested by the client at PE-CE interface.  In
      sake of alignment, the same protocols are supported.

Internet-Draft                    l3nm                     November 2019


5.2.  Relation with Network Topology

   The L3NM model manages VPN Services running over Service Provider
   Backbone network.  The set of nodes over which it is possible to
   deploy a L3 VPN Service MAY be part of the topology contained in an
   ietf-network module.

5.3.  Relation with Device Models

   Creating services in the l3vpn-ntw module will will lead at some
   point to the configuration of devices.  Hence, it is foreseen that
   the data for the device yang modules will be derived partially from
   the L3NM vpn-service container.  Note that L3NM is NOT a device
   model.

6.  L3VPN Examples

6.1.  4G VPN Provissioning Example

   The L3VPN service defined in this draft provides a multipoint, routed
   service to the customer over an IP/MPLS core.  The L3VPNs are widely
   used to deploy 3G/4G, fixed and enterprise services principally due
   to the fact that several traffic discrimination policies can be
   applied in the network to transport and guarantee the right SLAs to
   the mobile customers.

   As it is shown in the Figure 11, commonly the eNODEB (CE) is directly
   connected to the access routers (DCSG) of the mobile backhaul and
   their logical interfaces (one or many according to the Service type)
   are configured in a VPN that transport the packets to the mobile core
   platforms.

                                                        +--------------+
           +------+    +-----+    +-----+    +-----+    |  Platforms   |
           |eNODEB|--/-|  PE |----|  P  |----|  PE |----|  (SGW/MME)   |
           +------+    +-----+    +-----+    +-----+    |     ...      |
                                                        +--------------+

   This document requests IANA to register the following YANG module in
   the "YANG Module Names" subregistry [RFC6020] within the "YANG
   Parameters" registry.

      name: ietf-l3vpn-ntw

      namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l3vpn-ntw

      maintained by IANA: N

      prefix: l3nm

      reference: RFC XXXX

9.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040] .  The lowest NETCONF
   layer is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement
   secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest
   RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is TLS [RFC8466].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   The ietf-l3vpn-ntw module is used to manage L3 VPNs in a service
   provider backbone network.  Hence, the module can be used to request,
   modify, or retrieve L3VPN services.  For example, the creation of a
   vpn-service leaf instance triggers the creation of an L3 VPN Service
   in a Service Provider Network.

   Due to the foreseen use of the YANG module, there are a number of
   data nodes defined in this YANG module that are writable/creatable/
   deletable (i.e., config true, which is the default).  These data
   nodes MAY be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config) and delete
   operations to these data nodes without proper protection or
   authentication can have a negative effect on network operations.
   These are the subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/
   vulnerability in the ietf-l3vpn-ntw module:

   o  vpn-service: An attacker who is able to access network nodes can
      undertake various attacks, such as deleting a running L3 VPN
      Service, interrupting all the traffic of a client.  In addition,

      an attacker may modify the attributes of a running service (e.g.,
      QoS, bandwidth, routing protocols), leading to malfunctioning of
      the service and therefore to SLA violations.  In addition, an
      attacker could attempt to create a L3 VPN Service.  Such activity
      can be detected by monitoring and tracking network configuration
      changes.

   o  COMPLETE rest of critical data nodes and subtrees

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  customer-name and ip-connection: An attacker can retrieve privacy-
      related information which can be used to track a customer.
      Disclosing such information may be considered as a violation of
      the customer-provider trust relationship.

   Summing up, the foreseen risks of using the l3vpn-ntw module can be
   clasified into:

   o  Malicious clients attempting to delete or modify services

   o  Unauthorized clients attempting to create/modify/delete a service

   o  Unauthorized clients attempting to read service information

10.  Implementation Status

10.1.  Nokia Implementation

   Nokia has a draft implementation of the IETF L3NM model.

   The implementation is a prototype and is currently being planned for
   production.

   Nokia NSP (Network Services Platform) supports integration of
   standard models with the Intent Manager framework.  NSP platform
   provides hot pluggable model definitions and implementations which
   would enable defining models where standardization is in progress or
   non-existent.  With pluggable architecture for model and
   implementation injections, NSP also serves as a Multi-Layer, Multi-
   Domain controller.

   The Nokia implementation of L3NM covers, the following

   The implementation's level of maturity: research, prototype, alpha,
   beta, production, widely used, etc.

   Right now, the data model is still subject to change, therefore it is
   still a Prototype, not put into production yet.

10.3.  Infinera Implementation

   Infinera has a draft implementation of the IETF L3NM model.  The
   implementation is in beta state and is currently being tested and
   integrated with other suppliers controllers supporting this same
   model.  Infinera is supporting the L3NM model in its Transcend
   Maestro Multi-layer, Multi-domain Controller.

   The Infinera implementation of L3NM covers discovery and
   configuration of IP VPN services, and is supporting both North-Bound
   (server) and South-Bound (client) functionality.  Versions 01 and 02
   of the model are supported.

   The current implementation is proprietary, so under no terms the
   current implementation can be used.
