          2.  Introduction

          A network management system contains: several (potentially
          many) nodes, each with management instrumentation termed an
          agent; at least one management station; and, a management
          protocol, which is used to convey management information
          between the agents and management stations.  Operations of the
          protocol are carried out under an administrative framework
          which defines both authentication and authorization policies.

          Network management stations execute management applications
          which monitor and control network elements.  Network elements
          are devices such as hosts, routers, terminal servers, etc.,
          which are monitored and controlled through access to their
          management information.

          Management information is viewed as a collection of managed
          objects, residing in a virtual information store, termed the
          Management Information Base (MIB).  Collections of related
          objects are defined in MIB modules.  These modules are written
          using a subset of OSI's Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
          [1], termed the Structure of Management Information (SMI) [2].

          The management protocol, termed the Simple Management Protocol
          (SMP) [3], provides for the exchange of messages which convey
          management information between the agents and the management
          stations.  It is the purpose of this document to define
          managed objects which describe the behavior of a SMP entity.
