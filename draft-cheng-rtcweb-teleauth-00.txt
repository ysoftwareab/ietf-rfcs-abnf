              Security Authentication of WebRTC Communication Service
                           for Telephony Terminal
                    draft-cheng-rtcweb-teleauth-00

Abstract
   The WebRTC use-cases and related requirements are defined in
   [draft-ietf-rtcweb-use-cases-and-requirements] that contains browser to
   browser use-cases and browser-GW/server use-cases (e.g., telephony
   terminal). In the use-case of telephony terminal, it is necessary for
   telephony terminal to be able to attest his identity to the telephony
   operator. Unlike the current authentication specified in
   [draft-ietf-rtcweb-security] such as PKI based authentication and web
   based peer authentication WebRTC communication is directly controlled
   by the telephony operator, which poses new authentication methods,
   including re-using existence authentication mechanism of telephony
   operator and authentication by using web credentials. This document
   presents the security authentication of WebRTC communication for
   telephony terminal.

   but not the web server. Therefore, the current authentication solutions
   (i.e., PKI based authentication and web based peer authentication) are
   only adaptive for service facilitated by web server, new authentication
   solutions due to a new exploited entity as operator server should be
   defined for the use case of telephony terminal, all telephony terminals
   can be authenticated to access WebRTC communication service provided by
   the telephony operator.

   This document presents the security authentication of WebRTC
   communication for telephony terminal.

Internet-Draft         Telephony Authentication                     Feb 2014

   Terminal: the terminal with browser that is equipped with a WebRTC JS
   application capable of interconnection with the operator server.

   WebRTC application: The WebRTC application is downloaded from the Web
   server within the operator network or a third party network and provides
   access to the communications service from the telephony operator.

   Web server: The Web Server is the initial point to contact in the Web
   that controls access WebRTC communications service for the terminal.

   Operator server: The operator server is the point to verify any possible
   authentications of terminals and provide the specific WebRTC communication
   service for terminals.


3. Problem Statement
3.1 use cases

   Nowadays, in current WebRTC use-cases (i.e., browser-to-browser use-cases),
   the terminals with WebRTC enable browsers visit some Web server which
   operates a calling service. The current authentication solution either
   uses PKI-style certificate or Web-based identity (e.g., Brower ID) to
   authenticate the terminals. In fact, not only the Web server but also the
   telephony operator can provide a calling service for their terminals.

   As depicted in [draft-ietf-rtcweb-use-cases-and-requirements], there exists
   a specific use-case as follows:
   Telephony terminal: A mobile telephony operator allows its customers to use
   a web browser to access their services. After a simple log in the user can
   place and receive calls in the same way as when using a normal mobile
   phone. When a call is received or placed, the identity is shown in the same
   manner as when a mobile phone is used.
   The use-case of Telephony terminal supports two different solutions that
   differ in authentication methods and ownership of the web server (i.e.,
   operator or the third party). The two solutions are depicted as follows:

   Solution 1: The user has a subscription with an identity belongs to the
   telephony operator and uses an authentication method (e.g. SIP digest) to
   validate itself with the operator server.

Internet-Draft         Telephony Authentication                     Feb 2014

   Solution 2: The user has a subscription with an operator identity but
   uses a web identity and authentication scheme to authenticate with the
   Web server. The Web server assigns the user an operator credential in
   terms of the user's web credential for making authentication with the
   operator server. As aforementioned, the existing authentication solutions
   are no longer appropriate in the use-case of telephony terminals. When a
   telephony terminal requests for a calling service, it should prove its
   identity belongs to the telephony operator in advance, so that the
   operator permits it to access WebRTC service.

3.2 Current solutions analysis

   In the browser-to-browser use-cases, each browser which attempt to
   communicate with exposes standardized JavaScript calling APIs
   (implemented as browser built-ins) which are used by the Web server
   to set up a call. The Web server also serves as the signaling channel
   to transport control messages between the browsers and service JS sets
   up some media.

   In such use-cases, the conventional solution to providing communications
   identity usually uses third party identity system (e.g., PKI) to
   authenticate the browsers.
   Furthermore, a new solution using Web-based identity technologies (e.g.,
   BrowserID, Federated Google Login, Facebook Connect, OAuth, OpenID,
   WebFinger) has recently been developed to provide lightweight (from the
   user's perspective) third-party Web-based peer authentication. It uses
   systems of this type to authenticate WebRTC calls, linking them to
   existing third identity (e.g., Facebook adjacencies). Specifically, the
   third-party identity system is used to bind the user's identity to
   cryptographic keying material which is then used to authenticate the
   browsers.

3.3 problem statement

   1.	The current solution has the following problems:For PKI-based solution
   (i.e., PKI-style certificate), it needs to use certificate which is preset
   between the user and the server. But the certificate management is too
   cumbersome, including certificate application, issuance, updating, and
   dispose, it needs to setup the complicated certificate management module.

Internet-Draft         Telephony Authentication                     Feb 2014

   When AKA procedures using certificate need to check the validity of
   certificate, it costs extra complexity. However, for telephony user, it
   owns pre-shared key with operator rather than certificate. Therefore, PKI
   usage doesn't fit for telephony users.

   2.	For Web-based solution (i.e., Web-based peer authentication), it is
   suitable for browser-to-browser use-cases, since the browser is able to
   directly identify the other calling browser by connecting a Web-based
   (i.e., HTTP/HTTPS) identity provider without trusting the Web server
   which they are logged in. That means it is a general principle that the
   party which is being authenticated is NOT the signaling site (i.e., Web
   server) but rather the user with his browser. Refers to
   [draft-ietf-rtcweb-security-arch] However, it is necessary for operator
   server to authenticate its users with their browsers in the telephony
   terminal use-case. Therefore, Web-based solution can't address this
   requirements.

4. Requirement

   In order to provide the secure WebRTC communication service from the
   telephony operator to its users/terminals, it is need to design new
   security authentication solutions for terminals to prove their
   identities through WebRTC methods in the use-case of telephony terminal.

5. Telephony Terminal Authentication Solution

5.1. Introduction

   The security authentication of the use-case so-called Telephony terminal
   is the adaptive mechanism for the involved entities such as operator
   server, web server and the terminal to make authentication for WebRTC
   communication service.

   There are two solutions for the authentication mechanisms:
   Solution 1: The user has a subscription with an identity belongs to the
   telephony operator and uses an authentication method (e.g. SIP digest) to
   validate itself with the operator server.
   Solution 2: The user has a subscription with an operator identity but
   uses a web identity and authentication scheme to authenticate with the

Internet-Draft         Telephony Authentication                     Feb 2014

   Web server. The Web server assigns the user a operator credential in
   terms of the user's web credential for making authentication with the
   operator server.

5.2. authentication solution 1

   1. By using a WebRTC-enabled browser, the terminal accesses a URI to the
      Web server facilitating an HTTPS connection. The TLS connection 
      provides one-way authentication of the server based on the server 
      certificate. The browser downloads and initializes the WebRTC 
      application from the Web server.
   2. The WebRTC application opens a WSS connection to the operator server
      using standard cross-origin resource sharing procedures to ensure that
      the application originated from a Web server authorized to access this 
      operator server.
   3. The WebRTC application launches a registration transaction with the
      operator server by sending a REGISTER request via the WSS connection.
      The REGISTER request includes authentication parameters 
      as needed for proper registration. This request is translated
      in the operator core network as it is processed by the operator server.
      This process leverage user credentials in HSS.

5.3. authentication solution 2

   1.	By using a WebRTC-enabled browser, the terminal accesses a URI to the
      Web server facilitating an HTTPS connection. The TLS connection 
      provides one-way authentication of the server based on the server 
      certificate. The browser downloads and initializes the WebRTC 
      application from the Web server.
   2.	The Web server authenticates the terminal using a common web
      authentication procedure, determines the identity registered with the
      operator and assigned it to the terminal, issues a security token to
      the terminal and returns the identity as claims within the security
      token to the terminal's WebRTC application.
   3.	The WebRTC application opens a WSS connection to the operator server
      using CORS procedures to ensure that the WebRTC application originated
      from a Web server authorized to access the operator server.
   4.	The WebRTC application sends a REGISTER request to the operator server
      via the WSS connection. The request includes the user identity

      extracted from the claims in the security token and the security token 
      received from the Web server.
   5.	The operator server validates the contents of the security token and
      confirms that the identity being registered is authorized by the
      security token.
   6.	The operator returns an OK response to the terminal to announce that
      authenticates terminal successfully.
