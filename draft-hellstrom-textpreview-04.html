Introduction</h3>

<p>This is a specification of methods for presentation of a real-time
      text conversation. The aim is to give the participants in a conversation
      a good opportunity to perceive the real-time flow of the conversation
      and also provide a display of the history of the conversation that makes
      it easy to follow the flow. One reason to specify the presentation
      method is to be able to give participants a synchronized view of the
      conversation even if they use different presentation characteristics.
      The methods are intended for use in a protocol environment where text
      can be transmitted in real-time or in fragments of messages. Both
      two-party situations and multi-party session presentations are
      specified. The specification is mainly on the presentation level,
      relatively independent of the transport layer. It has though some
      requirements on the lower layers, as well as some characteristics of the
      lower layers cause slightly different user experience in the
      presentation.
</p><br /><hr class="insert" />

<p style='text-align: left'>The method is possible to use for two-party calls and
        multi-party calls. A two-party view is shown in <a class='info' href='#example'>Figure&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Two-party call with real-time preview.</span><span>)</span></a>.

<p>Figure 1: The text is here displayed in a traditional chat view, with
      labelled entries from each participant ordered in a list with newest
      entry last. Older entries are scrolled up, out of the screen area when
      there is no room for them.
</p>
<p>Real-time text arriving from other participants is displayed in
      'preview areas' within the scrolling 'history' window. They are
      formatted to look different and are presented at the bottom of the
      history window until they are completed. When completed they move up in
      the history window and added to the history record. The text being
      entered by the local participant appears in a separate entry field that
      is preferably just below the history field (to minimize eye movements
      when reading and typing).

Scope</h3>

<p>This specification describes methods for presenting a text
      conversation so that the gradual entry of text is made visible to the
      users. One method has text flowing in real-time in a way that is similar
      to common text chat, but with the possibility to follow entries while
      they are created in a real-time preview area. The method may be applied
      on any text conversation transport method that transmits text on a
      character by character, time-sampled, word by word, or other small chunk
      basis. The methods cover both two-party and multi-party situations.

<a name="rfc.section.4"></a><h3>4.&nbsp;
Real-time preview presentation method</h3>

<p>The presentation method described here is intended to give a
      convenient view of a text conversation between two or more participants
      in a session. It is intended to be compatible with the requirements of
      ITU-T T.140 [1], and to look familiar for text chat users and be
      feasible to implement in terminals with small displays. The basic
      concept however could be implemented in other text technologies as well
      and displayed in different ways. ITU-T T.140 [1], Appendix I, describes
      a traditional chat view and a two-column view. The display formats shall
      be implemented so that terminals in a session can implement different
      display views meeting the requirements of T.140 [1] and giving the users
      a synchronized view of the flow of the conversation.

<a name="rfc.section.4.1"></a><h3>4.1.&nbsp;
Entries in creation</h3>

<p>Entries in creation SHALL be displayed in a real-time preview area,
        one for each participant for who is currently typing. The real-time
        preview areas MAY be placed under the list of completed entries as
        shown in Figure 1 and 2, or at any other suitable place in the user
        interface. If video from the participants is also displayed, then it
        MAY be suitable to display the real-time preview areas under the video
        image of the participant. The real-time text MAY also be displayed in
        a manner more closely associated with earlier exchanged text entries
        by the same participant (e.g. text from each participant goes in its
        own column).
</p>
<p>If real-time preview from other participants are placed under the
        list of completed entries as in Figure 1 and 2, the text being entered
        by the local participant SHOULD be placed at the bottom in its own
        text entry field. This is recommended for a number of reasons. First,
        this is the only "editable" text on the screen. It also facilitates an
        optional input behavior where the local user may sometimes be holding
        their text back until it is completed while normally transmission
        occurs in real-time. Having the user input area be in a separate field

Moving between different states</h3>

<p>Entries can be either "real-time (preview)" or "historical" and
        they can be either "displayed" or "hidden". When real-time text is
        received it SHALL BE classified as a real-time entry until an
        end-of-entry indicator is received. Real-time entries SHOULD be
        displayed in the real-time preview field. Once an end-of-entry
        indicator is received, the entry SHALL become historical and SHOULD be
        move into the history display field. Its position within the history
        SHALL be determined by the time that its end-of-entry indicator was
        received.
</p>
<p>The local user may select to hide either the entries while they are
        real-time (previews) or when they are historical. Hiding entries when
        they are in real-time state may be done to avoid distraction for the
        local participant. The feature to hide the entries while in real-time
        state SHOULD provide some alert when an end-of-entry indicator is
        received as well as when real-time text stops coming in for a period
        of time. (The alert due to pause in incoming text is important because
        some real-time text users are not accustomed to sending end of entry
        indications(e.g. RETURNs) or may use a text based end-of-entry
        indication (such as GA).
</p>
<p>An entry (or category of entries) can be placed in a hidden state
        by user command to hide it (them). (e.g. Hide all but "Mary" to make
        it easier to see her thread)

En bloc transmission</h3>

<p>It SHOULD be possible for the participants to hold their text and
        not have it sent to the other participants until after the
        end-of-message event occurs. This enables users who do not want their
        message to be viewed by other participants until they have verified
        it. This also facilitates editing since random editing can be done on
        the text block before it is sent. This also allows a block of text to
        be pasted into the text entry area and then edited before it is sent.
        This could be new text or a previous text entry that the user would
        like to resend with edits. The en bloc method SHALL NOT be the only
        method for sending. A 'real-time / block send' switch SHOULD be
        located near the local user's text entry field Real-time SHALL be the
        default method for sending but a user preference setting MAY change
        the default to en bloc.

Reasons to finish an entry</h3>

<p>The default end of entry action SHOULD be a new line request from
        the user.
</p>
<p>A specific send button MAY also be used.
</p>
<p>Users with most experience from real-time text communication may
        have a habit of not ending entries with a new line. There will be a
        risk that entries are left in real-time mode unintentionally not
        displayed and not read if the receiving end has hidden real-time
        display. Some actions are needed in order to avoid this risk.
</p>
<p>If an entry is left in real-time mode without any input activity
        for a long period (e.g. 10 seconds), the local participant should be
        given an indication that there is an unfinished entry in the input
        field, and given a hint to complete it. Optionally, e.g. when using a
        voice-to-text application for generating text, the application SHOULD
        create the end-of-entry.
</p>
<p>A full stop (".") followed by a short inactivity MAY also be
        configured to be used as an end of entry indication.
</p>
<p>For PSTN text gateways having user input from PSTN text telephones,
        the following sequences SHOULD be included among those causing an
        entry to be finished. These terminations would usually be done by the
        PSTN gateway:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Letters "GA" or "GASK" or "SKSK" followed by short inactivity
            (e.g. 3 seconds), for interaction with TTY users.
</li>
<li>Character "+" or "x" followed by short inactivity (e.g. 3
            seconds), for European textphone users.
</li>
<li>Characters "*" or "KOM" followed by short inactivity (e.g. 3
            seconds), for Northern Europe textphone users.
</li>
</ul>

<p>White spaces (space bar, New line, CR, and LF) after those
        characters SHALL be accepted and included in the finished entry. (Some
        users do type a space character after the turn-taking indicator and
        some textphones will send return after the turn-taking symbol).

Erasure</h3>

<p>Erasure SHALL only be done from the last character entered per
        participant. Erasure SHALL NOT be possible once entries have been
        moved into the history field.
</p>
<p>Transmitted characters that take no position on the display (e.g.
        Bell or Alert in Session) SHALL not take any specific erasing action,
        but be regarded to be erased simultaneously with the succeeding
        character.
</p>
<p>Characters that are composed by multiple keystrokes SHALL be erased
        by one erasing action.
</p>
<p>New lines inserted by automatic line break and word wrap actions
        purely for display formatting purposes by the local system SHALL not
        require any specific erasing action.
</p>
<p>When erasing, the erasing action MUST be performed strictly
        according to the rules above, in order to maintain a synchronized view
        of the conversation for the participants, even if conversation
        participants use different display formats, such as the two-panel mode

Transport and presentation considerations </h3>

<p>It is RECOMMENDED that characters be buffered and transmitted in 300
      ms intervals on the transport level. It is permissible to buffer
      characters for transmission in up to 500 ms intervals. Display of
      received chunks of text SHOULD be done one character at a time spread
      over the transmission interval so that adding a chunk of text to the
      real-time preview window approximately covers the transmission interval
      to give a smoother flow. <br />
 It SHOULD be possible
      to select participants in a multi-party situation for whom text is
      displayed, while text entries from others are hidden.
</p>
<p>It SHOULD be possible to hide the real-time preview area for selected
      participants, but let text be displayed when entries are completed.
</p>
<p><br />
 The presentation method MAY be used with
      transport methods for real-time text and for all text message methods
      where it is possible to use timer based transmission to transmit
      fragments of message entries.<br />

</p>
<p>The method MAY be applied on various text transmission technologies.
      It is designed in order to be usable for real-time text conversation
      with coding and presentation according to ITU-T T.140 including its
      amendment <a class='info' href='#T140.refs'>1<span> (</span><span class='info'>ITU-T, &ldquo;Recommendation T.140, Protocol for Multimedia Application           Text Conversation (including Addendum),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a> [T140.refs], and <a class='info' href='#RFC3550'>IETF RTP<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., Casner, S., Frederick, R., and V.

      in <a class='info' href='#RFC4103'>RFC 4103<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hellstrom, G. and P. Jones, &ldquo;RTP Payload for Text Conversation,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4103]. The methods for applying this
      in a multi-party situation is described in IETF Text media handling in
      RTP based real-time and message conferences <a class='info' href='#I-D.hellstrom-text-conference'>draft-hellstrom-text-conference<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hellstrom, G. and A. Wijk, &ldquo;Text media handling in RTP based real-time conferences,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.hellstrom&#8209;text&#8209;conference].
</p>
<p>Another environment where the real-time text with preview
      presentation is feasible, is with the messaging protocol <a class='info' href='#RFC4975'>IETF MSRP<span> (</span><span class='info'>Campbell, B., Mahy, R., and C. Jennings, &ldquo;The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP),&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4975], where the message fragment concept
      MAY be used for a real-time transmission and presentation according to
      the description in this specification. The text and real-time aspects of
      transmission are specified in <a class='info' href='#I-D.hellstrom-simple-text-transmission'>draft-hellstrom-simple-text-transmission<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hellstrom, G., Jones, P., and G.

      .
</p>
<p>The transport method SHALL allow identification of the source of
      text, so that text from different sources can be arranged for convenient
      and readable presentation at the receiving end. [e.g. to attach labels
      to the incoming text).

      device where the presentation is made, SHOULD be placed to the right of
      all other columns, so that users recognize the operating environment
      between different devices.
</p>
<p>In an environment with less space in the display it MAY be necessary
      to give up on displaying the relative time order in the column view in
      order to display more of the conversation contents in available
      space.
</p>
<p>Yet other situations MAY call for display in separate windows for
      example underneath video images from each participant.

<p>Figure 4: Example of text conversation entries placed
          underneath video images from each participant.
</p>

<p>When implemented in an environment that supports multi-party calls,
      it may be felt less important to maintain a real-time preview view of
      text from all participants. It may be very important for some
      participants to have rapid real-time preview presentation of selected
      participants, e.g. for live captioning of the call by a third party.
</p>
<p>Thus it may be desirable to be able to turn on or off the preview
      presentation per user. When turning off real-time preview from one
      participant, its presentation SHALL disappear from the preview window,
      and text SHALL be entered en-bloc to the history display as they are
      finished for that participant.

Presence indication</h3>

<p>Appropriate SIP based presence features SHOULD be used to indicate
      status in the user interface, e.g. that the user is typing when in
      &lsquo;en bloc&rsquo; mode.

Alerting</h3>

<p>In order to be useful for hearing impaired, deaf and deaf-blind users
      as well as all situations with all users, it is important to provide
      audible, visual and, where possible, tactile alerting from events in the
      text conversation application. <br />
 It should be
      possible for a user to get external alerting signals with a method
      preferred by the user. It may for example be vibration, light flashes or
      sound as selected by the user. It should also be possible to get
      alerting on the screen at certain events. <br />
 The
      signals to external alerting systems should be issued when an incoming
      request for session initiation is received. When the method is used in
      connection with <a class='info' href='#T140.refs'>T.140<span> (</span><span class='info'>ITU-T, &ldquo;Recommendation T.140, Protocol for Multimedia Application           Text Conversation (including Addendum),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a> [T140.refs] presentation, it
      should also be issued when the alert-in-session T.140 control event is
      received. <br />
 For minor events, for example when
      an entry from a user is completed and displayed in the conversation
      display area, an indication MAY be given e.g. by an on-screen flashing
      or any other suitable alerting signal. <br />
 It may
      be useful to provide external alerting also for these minor events in
      specific situations. If the user has not touched the application for a
      number of minutes when the minor event occurs it may be of interest to
      get an external alert. Details of such arrangements are outside the
      scope of this document.<br />
