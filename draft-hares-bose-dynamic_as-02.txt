Abstract

   This document provides a mechanism for Autonomous Systems within an
   AS Confederation to survive the disconnection to other AS within the
   AS confederation without dropping peers.  When all links to the other
   AS in the Confederation break, this mechanism allows the AS to revert
   to local AS to continue communication with E-BGP peers.  This
   mechanism has two parts: Capability signaling between the two parties
   at connection start to save two AS (internal and AS Confederation AS)

2.  Introduction

   This mechanism provides a mechanism for two BGP peers switching AS
   values within a BGP association without dropping the AS connection.

   When two BGP wish to re-configure with a different Autonomous
   numbers, the current mechanisms in BGP require that the AS drop the
   connection.  If an AS has considerable fan-in of peers, this dropping
   of the connection to re-associate a new AS may cause significant
   outages.

   This Dynamic AS re-association capability allows two Autonomous
   Systems and their BGP peers to collude to reset the AS associated
   with a BGP peer session without dropping the AS connection.  The two
   BGP peers agree upon a fail-over to another AS based on a list of
   Autonomous Systems.

3.  Mechanism overview for Dynamic AS Re-association

   The mechanism has two parts:

   1) An Dynamic AS capability

   The Dynamic AS capability signals the ability to use the Dynamic AS
   re-association function.

   The format of the AS-Edge capability is described in section 4 and
   contains a list of Autonomous systems that the BGP peer may re-
   associated to.  This capability also indicates the mechanism by which
   the node will signal the switch is the dynamic capabilities message.

   Within an AS, any BGP peer that will send an AS-Edge Capability to an
   Exterior peer MUST send the AS-Edge capability to all IBGP peers.
   Only if all IBGP Peers successfully negotiated the AS-Edge
   capability, can BGP dynamically switch over to another AS.

   2) Signaling the Dynamic AS Switch-over - Originator

   Signaling a Dynamic Switch is done via the Dynamic Capability message
   with the Dynamic AS capability (format in section 5).

   The BGP peer decides to initiate the dynamic AS switch over by using
   local policy and implementation specific mechanisms.  To signal the
   Dynamic AS switch over, the initiating BGP peer has two steps.

      Step 1: Send IBGP peers a "Dynamic AS Switch-over

         Upon receiving a "Dynamic AS change" indication to the BGP
         process, the BGP process will send to IBGP peers a "Dynamic AS
         Switch-over" message.  Upon receiving the ACK from all IBGP
         peers for the Dynamic AS Capability, the BGP peer can start
         step 2.

         In case of the receiving IBGP peer's local BGP implementation
         detecting a failure to switch to a new AS, the Dynamic
         Capability will be signaled with a "failure" flag.  This
         failure will halt the originating Peer switch to the new AS.

         Any failure of an IBGP peer in the IBGP cloud, will not allow
         the BGP peer to progress to step 2.

         If the IBGP peers are part of a Route-Reflection hierarchy, a
         Route Reflector MUST wait to send an ack to the Dynamic AS
         change after it has signaled all of its clients and all of it
         total mesh peers.  In this way, when the initiating IBGP peer



Hares & Bose            Expires September 6, 2006               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                 DYNAMIC-AS                     March 2006


         receives the Dynamic Capability ACK, the rest of the IBGP peer
         has been informed.

         The Dynamic Capability may pass back success or failure in the
         Dynamic AS flag word.  The Dynamic Capability ACK MUST only use
         the Short form (sequence number only) for Dynamic AS
         Capabilities that are a success.  If the Dynamic AS capability
         is a failure, the full Dynamic Capability must be used with the
         failure flag.

      Step 2: Send all EBGP peers the Dynamic AS Change.

         Signal each EBGP peers to change AS by sending the Dynamic AS
         dynamic capability in a Capability message.

         Upon receiving this dynamic capability from an E-BGP peer, the
         BGP speaker associated with the AS Edge processes the switch of
         the peer from the current AS number to the one specified in the
         capability.  This change in processing includes:

            -All checking of the local AS in BGP packets utilizes the
            new AS.

            -All new routes will be announced with the new AS number.

            -All older routes will be re-announced based on the AS
            resend flag.

         Upon successful processing, the EBGP peer will acknolwedge the
         Dynamic AS capability by sending a Dynamic Capability with an
         Ack in the Dynamic Capability flag and an "ack-succeess"
         indication in the Dynamic Capabiity flag word.

   3) E-BGP Peer Receiving a Signaling the Dynamic AS Switch-over

   Upon receiving a "Dynamic AS Change" Dynamic capability from an EBGP
   peer, the EBGP peer will follow 2 steps:

      Step 1: Upon receiving a "Dynamic AS change" capability to the BGP
      process, the BGP process will send to IBGP peers "Dynamic AS
      Switch-over" message with the E-BGP peer flag set.

         Upon receiving the Dynamic Capability with the "Ack" bit set
         from all IBGP peers for the Dynamic AS Capability, the BGP peer
         can start step 2.

         Again, if the IBGP peers of the receiving BGP are part of a
         Route-Reflection hierarchy, a Route Reflector MUST only send an

Internet-Draft                 DYNAMIC-AS                     March 2006


         ACK to the Dynamic AS change after it has successfully sent the
         Dynamic Capability to its clients and all of it total mesh
         peers.  In this way, when the initiating IBGP peer receives the
         Dynamic capability ACK, the rest of the IBGP peer has been
         informed.

         In case of errors in resetting the Dynamic AS capability, the
         receiving IBGP peer can set the "Failure" flag in the Dynamic
         capability that is being ACK.  Any failures will be signaled to
         the originating AS, and the Dynamic AS switch terminated.

      Step 2: Respond to E-BGP AS with Dynamic AS change

         The E-BGP peer responds to the originated AS with a Dynamic AS
         change with an EBGP flag set and the Failure bit off.

         Upon receiving this dynamic capability from an E-BGP peer, the
         BGP speaker associated with the AS Edge process the switch of
         the peer from the current AS number to the one specified in the
         capability.  This switch includes:

            -All checking of the local AS in BGP packets utilizes the
            new AS.

            -All new routes will be announced with the new AS number.

            -All older routes will be re-announced based on the AS
            resend flag.

4.  Open Dynamic AS Capability

   RFC 3992 [2] describes the open capability mechanisms.  This document
   describes a new Capability: Dynamic AS.



        +------------------------------+
        | Capability Code (1 octet)    |
        +------------------------------+
        | Capability Length (1 octet)  |
        +------------------------------+
        | Capability Value (variable)  |
        +------------------------------+

         Where the Capability value is:

        +------------------------------+
        | Length of AS (1 octet)       | - length of AS field (2 or 4)
        +------------------------------+
        | Reserved  (5 bits)           | - Reserved
        +------------------------------+
        | resend prefix flag (3 bits)  | - Resend/AS Flag
        +------------------------------+
        | Number of AS supported       | - # of AS in re-associate list
        +------------------------------+
        | AS originating capability    | - AS that send this open cap.
        +------------------------------+
        | Autonomous System 1          | - AS 1 dynamic re-association
        +------------------------------+
        |         .........                  |
        +------------------------------+
        | Autonomous System N          | - AS N dynamic re-association
        +------------------------------+


   Figure 1: Dynamic AS Open Capability Bytes

   The resend prefix flag indicates when the AS will resend the routes
   with the new AS.  The flag values are set as a bit pattern to
   indicate that

      0x00 - Resend routes based on local timer (in bataches)

      0x01 - Resend routes immediately

      0x02 - Don't resend routes (leave with old AS confederation)

   The number of AS supported field gives the number of the Autonomous
   Systems fin the dynamic re-association list.The Autonomous Systems in
   the AS list are the list of ASes that this peer may switch to in when
   dynamically re-association from the original AS to a new AS.

   Each side of the peer will send a list of Autonomous Systems that it
   will dynamic re-associate with.  Upon start-up the re-associations
   list can be check by policy to determine that each side can support
   the required re-associations.

5.  Capability Message

   This BGP dynamic capability uses the new BGP Dynamic Capability DYN-
   CAP [3] format of:

      +------------------------------+
      | Init/Ack (1 bit)             |
      +------------------------------+
      | Ack Request (1 bit)          |

6.  Prevention of Loops

   Because all IBGP nodes are synchronized before an EBGP peer is
   transition to a new AS, the local BGP logic can detect the full
   transition.

   If any active IBGP peer is unable to transition, the whole transition
   to the new AS stops.

   If there is any local consideration that the AS has split and
   existing routes may cause a black hole, implementation MAY set the
   "re-announce all routes now" flag to prevent loops.

   The two stages of IBGP negotation (IBGP only and EBGP/IBGP
   negotiation) allow the peer to negotiated the ability to AS change
   before information exterior peers.  The two stage IBGP negotiation
   can reduce or eliminate chatter to EBGP peers while the IBGP peers
   settle on the decision to change the AS.  In an IBGP cloud with
   single or double level Route-Reflector hierarchy and hundreds of
   E-BGP peers, this Route-Reflector hierarchy can reduce chatter.

   AS confederation with several ASes internal to the IBGP that desire
   to use the Dynamic AS re-association may benefit from a two stage
   IBGP negotiation for internal synchronization before re-negotiation
   with exterior peers.

   1) Route Reflector Example

   Nodes B, C, D, an E form an AS 200.  Node A is in AS 300.  Node F is
   AS 500.

      Node A is connected to Node B and Node E.

      Node B is connected to Node C and Node E

      Node C is connected to Node B, Node D, Node E and Node F.

      Node D is connected to Node C and Node F.

      Node E is connected to Node C, B, and A.

      Node F is connected to Node D and Node C.

   [Note: The authors did not say who was on first base.  Just what
   nodes are playing in the game. ;-) (it's a joke.)]

   When node D is disconnected from Node C, the Dynamic AS switch takes
   place.  Node C decides to switch switch to AS 1000 for IBGP and EBGP.

      4.  Node B sends a dynamic capability (seqence number 10) with an
          ACK flag sest and a Dynamic AS capability inside with flags
          set to: IBGP, Reserve, AS-in-Use Internal, Failure.

      5.  Node E successful can switch to the Internal AS.  Node E sends
          the capability message with an ACK flag, sequence number 30,
          and an Dynamic AS capability inside.  The flags inside the
          Dynamic AS capability are set to: IBGP, Reserve, AS-In Use
          Internal, and Success.

      6.  Node C sends sends a capability message to Node E with
          sequence number 31, Delete flag, Dynamic AS capability with
          flag bits set to: IBGP, Reserve, AS-in-Use Internal, and
          Failure.

      7.  Node E clears all Dynamic AS state and respond with a
          capability messages with an "Ack" flag set, sequence number
          31, Delete Flag, Dynanic AS capability with flag bits set to:
          IBGP, Reserve, AS-in-Use Internal and Failure.

      8.  Node C, B, and E form one portion of AS 200, and Node D forms
          another portion of AS 200.  Loops will occur in AS F and AS a
          talking to AS 200.  These loops are possible with an AS that
          splits into 2 halfs.  The Dynamic AS renumbering failiure
          simple fails back to the normal BGP case.

      2) Two stage commit with IBGP peers with success

      1.   Node C's sends a Capability message to Node B with sequence
           number 10 and an Add capability for Dynamic AS Capability.
           Inside the Dynamic AS capability the flags are set for: IBGP,
           Reserve and AS-in-Use Internal, Success (always on request
           capability).  Inside the Dynamic AS Confed_Edge capability
           the cur AS is 200, and the new AS is 1000.

      2.   Node C's sends a Capability message to Node E with sequence
           number 30 and an Add capability for Dynamic AS Capability.
           Inside the Dynamic AS capability the flags are set for: IBGP,
           Reserve and AS-in-Use Internal,and sucess.  Success (always
           on request capability).  Inside the Dynamic AS capability,
           the cur AS is 200 and the new AS is 1000.

      3.   Node B trys to engage the AS 1000 switch and succeeds.  Node
           B responds to Node C with a capability message with sequence
           number 10, Ack Flag set, and a Dynamic AS capability inside.
           The Dynmic AS capability has flags set for: IBGP, Reserve, AS
           in-Use, and Success.

      4.   Node E successful can switch to the Internal AS.  Node E
           sends the capability message with an ACK flag, sequence
           number 30, and an AS capability inside.  The flags inside the
           AS capability are set to: IBGP, Reserve, AS-In Use Internal,
           and Success.

      5.   Node C's sends a capability message to Node B (seq 11) and
           Node E (sequence 31) with an Add capability for Dynamic AS
           capability.  Inside the Dynamic AS Capability,the flags are
           set to: IBGP, Reserve and AS-in-Use Internal, Start, and
           Success (always on request capability.  AS 200 is in the
           current AS.  AS 1000 is in the new AS.

      6.   Node B (sequence 11) sends back a capability messages with
           ACK bit set on the Add of the Dynamic AS capability.  Within
           the Dynamc AS capability, the flags are set to: IBGP, Start,
           AS-in-Use Internal, and Success.  Node B starts to send
           capability mesages with Dynamic AS capability to the E-BGP
           peers.

           1.  Node B sends to Node A a capability message with Add for
               Dynamic AS capability with sequence number 5.  Inside the
               Dynamic AS capability, the flags are set to: EBGP, Start,
               AS-in-Use Internal, and Success.  The current AS is 200
               and the new AS is 1000.

           2.  Node A validates it can switch the E-BGP session to
               receive AS 1000 from Node B. Node A sends back a
               capability message with sequence number 5 with an ACK
               flag set with an Dynamic AS capability inside.  Inside
               the Dynamic AS capability the flags are set to: EBGP,
               Start, AS-in-Use Internal and Success.

      7.   Node E sends node C a capability messages with sequence
           number 31, Action Add and An Ack Flag set.  The Dynamic AS
           capabilty is contained inside with flags set to: EBGP, Start,
           AS-in-Use Internal, and Success.  Node E starts to send
           capability messages iwth Dynamic AS capability to the E-BGP
           peers.

           1.  Node E sends to Node A a capability messages with
               sequence number of 15.  Action Add and a Dynamic AS
               capability inside.  Inside the Dynamic AS Confed_edge
               capability the flags are set to: EBGP, Start, AS-in-Use
               Internal,and Success.  The AS information is current AS
               200 and new AS 1000.

           2.  Node A validates it can change the EBGP session to AS 300
               to AS 1000, and then sends a capability to confirm the
               Ack. The capability messages contains sequence number 15,
               Add Action, Ack flag, and a Dynamic AS Confed_Edge
               capability inside with flags of: EBGP, Start, AS-in-Use
               Internal, and Success/ Of course, the AS information is
               current AS 200, and new AS 1000.

      8.   After Node C sends the capability messages to it's internal
           peers (Node E and Node B), it sends dynamic capabilities to
           Node F (in AS 500 external to the new AS 1000.)

      9.   Node F process C's capability message

           1.  Node F receives a capability message from Node C with
               sequence number 200, Add Action, and Dynamic AS
               Confed_Edge capability inside.  Inside the Dynamic AS
               Confed_Edge capability the flags are set to: EBGP, Start,
               AS-in-Use Internal, and Success.  The AS information is:
               current AS 200 and new AS 1000.

           2.  Node F determines it can switch the EBGP session with
               Node C to AS 1000.

           3.  Node F sends back a capability message with sequence
               number 200, Add Action, and Dynamic AS capabiliity
               inside.  Inside the Dynamic AS capability, the flags are
               set to: EBGP, Start, AS-in-Use Internal and Success.
               AGain, the AS information is: current AS 200 and new AS
               1000.

      10.  At this point:

           1.  AS 300 has: Node A

           2.  AS 1000 has: Node C, B and E

           3.  AS 200 has Node D

           4.  AS 500 has Node F

           5.  AS 300 peers with AS 1000

           6.  AS 1000 peers with AS 300 (Node A), and AS 500 (Node F).

           7.  AS 500 peers with AS 200 (Node D) and AS 1000 (Node)

           8.  Traffic can flow to Node E via an E-BGP path.

   The two stage commit allows the internal AS one stage to confirm
   resources with IBGP peers prior to disturbing and E-BGP peers.  If an
   E-BGP peer fails after the IBGP cloud has switched, the single E-BGP
   peer can be dropped and re-initialized.

   If there is any local consideration that the AS has split and
   existing routes may cause a black hole, implementation MAY set the
   "re-announce all routes now" flag to prevent loops.

7.  Security Considerations

   The security of the BGP exchange is optionally secured by the TCP MD5
   key.

   Upon discussion with security reviewers, the addition of this feature
   will neither improve nor detract from the TCP MD5 level of security.
   The authors considered adding a "cookie" feature to further secure
   this exchange.  Again, review with security experts indicated this
   "cookie" feature would not improve the security level.

   The TCP session security will continue across the dynamic BGP peer
   re-association.  The TCP sessions dynamic MD5 re-association or key
   switch would also allow TCP sessions to continue for a long period.
