                    Simple DHCP for 6LoWPAN Networks
                       draft-hui-6lowpan-dhcp-00

Abstract

   6LoWPAN nodes may find it useful to utilize DHCPv6 to obtain
   configuration parameters.  In addition to network-layer information
   that any IPv6 node may require, 6LoWPAN nodes may find DHCP useful
   for obtaining link-specific parameters such as short link addresses
   or 6LoWPAN header compression contexts.  Both stateful and stateless
   configuration DHCP modes may be useful in 6LoWPAN networks.  This
   document describes a simplified form of DHCPv6 for use in 6LoWPAN
   networks.

Internet-Draft      Simple DHCP for 6LoWPAN Networks          March 2010


1.  Introduction

   As with any IPv6 network, 6LoWPAN nodes may require configuration
   parameters to effectively participate in the network and utilize
   services provided by other nodes, such as IPv6 addresses, prefix
   information, or a list of DNS servers.  However, 6LoWPAN networks may
   also need to obtain link-specific configuration parameters.  For
   example, IEEE 802.15.4 allows the use of 16-bit short link addresses
   that are not globally unique to reduce link-layer header overhead
   [ieee802154].  Additionally, the 6LoWPAN header compression format
   utilizes context information to efficiently compress IPv6 headers
   [I-D.ietf-6lowpan-hc].

   DHCPv6 [RFC3315] is currently the most widely available approach to
   distributing and managing configuration information within a network.
   The introduction of DHCP relay agents makes it possible for a single
   DHCP server to service an entire 6LoWPAN network, even if the network
   is configured as a route-over network and operates over multiple IP
   hops.

   By using DHCPv6, 6LoWPAN networks can utilize the same infrastructure
   for managing configuration information as with any other IPv6
   network.  It is possible to re-use existing DHCPv6 options such DNS
   configuration options.

   In addition to managing configuration parameters, use of DHCPv6
   provides additional opportunities.  Because a DHCP server manages a
   central repository for IPv6 addresses, the same repository can be
   used to help ensure that no duplicate IPv6 addresses are in use among
   nodes that maintain a binding with the DHCP server.  Duplicate
   Address Detection may be unnecessary if all 6LoWPAN nodes maintain
   DHCP bindings for any IPv6 addresses in use.

   A downside with DHCPv6 is that it was designed to be very general and
   extensible.  The generality and extensibility can make DHCP
   prohibitively costly to implement within the resource constraints
   typical for 6LoWPAN networks.  Furthermore, the method of discovering
   a DHCP server or relay agent requires the use of multicast messages,
   which are especially costly within 6LoWPAN networks.  As a result, it
   is attractive to limit what DHCP mechanisms are used and utilize
   compact representations of DHCP messages.

   The remainder of this document species the use of a simple and
   compact DHCP protocol for use in 6LoWPAN networks, called 6LoWPAN-
   DHCP.  The protocol supports a strict subset of DHCPv6 defined in
   [RFC3315].  Through stateless translation mechanisms implemented at
   DHCP relay agents, existing DHCPv6 servers may be used to communicate
   directly with 6LoWPAN-DHCP clients and relay agents.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Network Architecture

   To efficiently support DHCPv6 in 6LoWPAN networks, all 6LoWPAN edge
   routers MUST implement either DHCP server or relay agent
   functionality on all 6LoWPAN interfaces.  All 6LoWPAN edge routers
   must also subscribe to the ANY_6LOWPAN_DHCP_ROUTER_AND_AGENT anycast
   address.  All 6LoWPAN routers MUST implement DHCP relay agent
   functionality on all 6LoWPAN interfaces.

   In a network connected by only a single edge router, implementing a
   DHCP server in the edge router is sufficient.  In a network connected
   by multiple edge routers, implementing DHCP relay agent at the edge
   routers is needed to forward DHCP messages between the client and the
   DHCP server.

   6LoWPAN routers forward all DHCP client messages to the
   ANY_6LOWPAN_DHCP_ROUTER_AND_AGENT anycast address.  By using an
   anycast address, it is not necessary to explicitly configure relay
   agents with the specific address of another DHCP relay agent or
   server.  Requiring all 6LoWPAN routers to provide DHCP relay agent
   functionality ensures that any 6LoWPAN node attempting to obtain
   configuration information can do so as long as the 6LoWPAN network
   itself is connected.  Another benefit of doing so is it eliminates
   the need for multicast messages used to discover which nodes provide
   DHCP server or relay agent functionality.


3.  Protocol Overview

   For simplicity, the only supported DHCP message types are Solicit,
   Rebind, Information-request, and Reply.  As such, 6LoWPAN-DHCP
   clients do not maintain any state that identifies DHCP servers.
   Instead, a 6LoWPAN-DHCP client may request assignment of new
   addresses using a Solicit-Reply exchange or renew lifetimes of
   existing addresses using a Rebind-Reply exchange.  To support
   Stateless DHCPv6 [RFC3736] in 6LoWPAN networks, 6LoWPAN-DHCP clients
   may also use Information-request exchanges.

   The basic protocol exchange for obtaining configuration parameters
   using these messages is identical to what is specified in [RFC3315].
   A 6LoWPAN node wishing to obtain configuration information may send a

Internet-Draft      Simple DHCP for 6LoWPAN Networks          March 2010


   DHCP Solicit or Information-request message to a DHCP server or relay
   agent.  If the destination is a DHCP relay agent, the relay agent
   then relays the client's message to a 6LoWPAN edge router using the
   ANY_6LOWPAN_DHCP_ROUTER_AND_AGENT anycast address.  Eventually, a
   DHCP server will receive the client's DHCP Solicit message, to which
   the server responds using a DHCP Reply message.  The DHCP Reply
   message will follow the same path through DHCP relay agents, if any
   exist, and then finally back to the DHCP client.  When a node needs
   to refresh its DHCP binding, it sends a DHCP rebind message to the
   DHCP server.

   Because every 6LoWPAN router MUST implement DHCP relay agent
   functionality, a client SHOULD unicast any DHCP messages to a
   neighboring router.  Unicast reduces the use of costly multicast
   transmissions and eliminates duplicate messages caused by multiple
   DHCP relay agents relaying the same DHCP message to the DHCP server.
   The specific router chosen may be the same as the default router.
   Other mechanisms for selecting a specific router is left out of
   scope.

   6LoWPAN networks typically have limited communication resources (e.g.
   small frame sizes, limited energy, etc.).  To respect those resource
   constraints, this document defines 6LoWPAN-DHCP, a simple and compact
   form of DHCPv6 for use within 6LoWPAN networks. 6LoWPAN-DHCP reduces
   the number of messages to only Solicit, Rebind, Information-request,
   and Reply.  New compact options are defined to carry both network-
   layer and 6LoWPAN-specific configuration parameters.  Being a strict
   subset of DHCPv6 makes simple translations with 6LoWPAN-DHCP
   possible.


4.  6LoWPAN-DHCP Client/Server Message Formats

   All 6LoWPAN-DHCP messages between clients and servers share the same
   fixed format header and a variable format area for options.

   Options are stored serially in the options field, with no padding
   between the options.  Options are byte-aligned but are not aligned in
   any other way such as on 2 or 4 byte boundaries.

   The following diagram illustrates the format of 6LoWPAN-DHCP messages
   sent between clients and servers:

   options                   Options carried in this message.

   The 6LoWPAN-DHCP message format builds on the client/server message
   formats found in [RFC3315].  The only difference is that 6LoWPAN-DHCP
   adds a client-identifier field.  While [RFC3315] is designed for
   generality, supporting client-identifiers with arbitrary length,
   6LoWPAN-DHCP clients MUST use a client identifier with a DUID based
   on an IEEE EUI-64 link-layer address.  By making this assumption,
   6LoWPAN-DHCP saves 8-octets in every message.


5.  6LoWPAN-DHCP Relay Agent/Server Message Formats

   Relay agents exchange messages with servers to relay messages between
   clients and servers that are not connected to the same link.

   Options are stored serially in the options field, with no padding
   between the options.  Options are byte-aligned but are not aligned in
   any other way such as on 2 or 4 byte boundaries.

                             either RELAY-FORW (12) or RELAY-REPL (13).

   DHCP-relay-message        In a Relay-forward message, the received
                             message, relayed verbatim to the next relay
                             agent or server; in a Relay-reply message,
                             the message to be copied and relayed to the
                             client whose link-local address is
                             generated from the client-identifier field
                             of the encapsulated Reply message.


6.  6LoWPAN-DHCP Configuration Exchange

   A client uses Solicit and Rebind messages during the normal life
   cycle of addresses.  It uses Information-Request messages when it
   needs configuration information but no addresses.

   The client is responsible for creating IAs and requesting that a
   server assign IPv6 addresses to the IA.  The client first creates an
   IA and assigns it an IAID.  The client then transmits a Solicit
   message containing an IA option describing the IA.  A server that can
   assign addresses to the IA responds to the client with a Reply
   message.

   For simplicity, 6LoWPAN-DHCP clients do not maintain state about DHCP
   servers.  As a result, all Solicit and Reply messages implicitly
   include the Rapid Commit option and the client only terminates the
   waiting process as soon as a Reply message is received.  Because
   6LoWPAN-DHCP does not make use of multicast, a Solicit message should
   be routed to a single server and any Reply messages should only come
   from a single server under normal operation.


7.  6LoWPAN-DHCP Relay Agent Behavior

   The relay agent MAY be configured to use a list of other addresses
   assigned by the network administrator.  If the relay agent has not

   been explicitly configured, it MUST use the
   ANY_6LOWPAN_DHCP_ROUTER_AND_AGENT as the default.

7.1.  Relaying a Client Message

   A 6LoWPAN-DHCP relay agent only forwards messages from other 6LoWPAN-
   DHCP clients.  Unlike [RFC3315], 6LoWPAN-DHCP only supports a single
   relay hop between a 6LoWPAN-DHCP client and 6LoWPAN edge router.  If
   the edge router is configured as a DHCPv6 relay agent, it MUST
   translate the message to the message formats defined in [RFC3315]
   before relaying to a [RFC3315] compliant relay agent or server.

   When a 6LoWPAN-DHCP relay agent receives a valid message to be
   relayed, it constructs a new Relay-forward message.  The relay agent
   copies the received DHCP message (excluding any IP or UDP headers)
   into the DHCP-relay-message field of the new message.

7.2.  Relaying a Reply Message

   The relay agent extracts the message from the DHCP-relay-message
   field and relays it to the link-local address generated from the
   client-identifier field of the encapsulated Reply message.


8.  6LoWPAN-DHCP Options

8.1.  Identity Association for Non-temporary Address Option

   The Identity Association for Non-temporary Addresses option (IA_NA
   option) is used to carry an IA_NA, the parameters associated with the
   IA_NA, and the non-temporary addresses associated with the IA_NA.

   The format of the IA_NA option is:

      0                   1                   2                   3

   those options that are specific to this address.

   option-len          20 + length of IAaddr-options field.

   IPv6 address        An IPv6 address.

   preferred-lifetime  The preferred lifetime for the IPv6 address in
                       the option, expressed in units of minutes.
   valid-lifetime      The valid lifetime for the IPv6 address in the
                       option, expressed in units of minutes.

   IAaddr-options      Options associated with this address.

8.3.  6LoWPAN Short Address Option

   The 6LoWPAN Short Address option is used to specify an IEEE 802.15.4
   short address associated with an IA_NA.  The 6LoWPAN Short Address
   option must be encapsulated in the Options field of an IA_NA option.

   The format of the 6LoWPAN Short Address option is:

      0                   1                   2                   3

   valid-lifetime      The valid lifetime for the 6LoWPAN Short Address
                       in the option, expressed in units of minutes.

   short-address:      A 6LoWPAN short address.

   In a message sent by a client to a server, a value in the lifetime
   field indicates the client's preference for the lifetime.  The client
   may send 0 if it has no preference for the lifetime.  In a message
   sent by the server to a client, the client MUST use the value in the
   lifetime field for the lifetime.  The value in the lifetime are the
   number of 10 second time units remaining.

   A 6LoWPAN Short Address option may appear only in an IA_NA option.
   At most one 6LoWPAN Address Option can appear in an IA_NA option.
