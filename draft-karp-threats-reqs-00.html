<h1><br />The Threat Analysis and
    Requirements for Cryptographic Authentication of Routing Protocols'
    Transports<br />draft-karp-threats-reqs-00</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>In the March of 2006 the IAB held a workshop on the topic of
      "Unwanted Internet Traffic". The report from that workshop is documented
      in <a class='info' href='#RFC4948'>RFC 4948<span> (</span><span class='info'>Andersson, L., Davies, E., and L. Zhang, &ldquo;Report from the IAB workshop on Unwanted Traffic March 9-10, 2006,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4948]. Section 8.2 of RFC 4948 calls
      for "[t]ightening the security of the core routing infrastructure." Four
      main steps were identified for improving the security of the routing
      infrastructure. One of those steps was "securing the routing protocols'
      packets on the wire," also called the routing protocol transport. One
      mechanism for securing routing protocol transports is the use of
      per-packet cryptographic message authentication, providing both peer
      authentication and message integrity. Many different routing protocols
      exist and they employ a range of different transport subsystems.
      Therefore there must necessarily be various methods defined for applying
      cryptographic authentication to these varying protocols. Many routing
      protocols already have some method for accomplishing cryptographic
      message authentication. However, in many cases the existing methods are
      dated, vulnerable to attack, and/or employ cryptographic algorithms that
      have been deprecated. The "Keying and Authentication for Routing
      Protocols" (KARP) effort aims to overhaul and improve these mechanisms.
      This document has two main parts. The first describes the threat
      analysis for attacks against routing protocols' transports. The second
      enumerates the requirements for addressing the described threats. This
      document, along with the KARP Design Guide and KARP Framework documents,
      will be used by KARP design teams for specific protocol review and
      overhaul. This document reflects the input of both the IETF's Security
      Area and Routing Area in order to form a jointly agreed upon
      guidance.

Introduction</h3>

<p>In March 2006 the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) held a workshop
      on the topic of "Unwanted Internet Traffic". The report from that
      workshop is documented in <a class='info' href='#RFC4948'>RFC 4948<span> (</span><span class='info'>Andersson, L., Davies, E., and L. Zhang, &ldquo;Report from the IAB workshop on Unwanted Traffic March 9-10, 2006,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4948].
      Section 8.1 of that document states that "A simple risk analysis would
      suggest that an ideal attack target of minimal cost but maximal
      disruption is the core routing infrastructure." Section 8.2 calls for
      "[t]ightening the security of the core routing infrastructure." Four
      main steps were identified for that tightening:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>More secure mechanisms and practices for
          operating routers. This work is being addressed in the OPSEC Working
          Group.
</li>
<li>Cleaning up the Internet Routing Registry repository [IRR], and
          securing both the database and the access, so that it can be used
          for routing verifications. This work should be addressed through
          liaisons with those running the IRR's globally.
</li>
<li>Specifications for cryptographic validation of routing message
          content. This work will likely be addressed in the SIDR Working
          Group.
</li>
<li>Securing the routing protocols' packets on the wire
</li>
</ul>

<p>This document addresses the last bullet, securing the packets on the
      wire of the routing protocol exchanges, i.e. the routing protocols'
      transports. This effort is referred to as Keying and Authentication for
      Routing Protocols, or "KARP". This document specifically addresses the
      threat analysis for per packet routing protocol transport
      authentication, and the requirements for protocols to mitigate those
      threats.
</p>
<p>This document is one of three that together form the guidance and
      instructions for KARP design teams working to overhaul routing protocol
      transport security. The other two are the <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-karp-design-guide'>KARP Design Guide<span> (</span><span class='info'>Lebovitz, G. and M. Bhatia, &ldquo;Keying and Authentication for Routing Protocols (KARP) Design Guidelines,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;karp&#8209;design&#8209;guide] and the
      <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-karp-framework'>KARP Framework<span> (</span><span class='info'>Atwood, W. and G. Lebovitz, &ldquo;Framework for Cryptographic Authentication of Routing Protocol Packets on the Wire,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;karp&#8209;framework].

Terminology</h3>

<p>Within the scope of this document, the following words, when
        beginning with a capital letter, or spelled in all capitals, hold the
        meanings described to the right of each term. If the same word is used
        uncapitalized, then it is intended to have its common english
        definition.
</p>
<p>[Editor's note: At this point, I'm not sure exactly which of these
        will end up being included in this document. They came for the
        original "roadmap document". We can clean out any unused terms a few
        revisions from now.]

<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>PSK</dt>
<dd>Pre-Shared Key. A key used by both peers in a

<dt>Routing Protocol</dt>
<dd>When used with capital "R" and "P"
            in this document the term refers the Routing Protocol for which
            work is being done to provide or enhance its peer authentication
            mechanisms.

<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>PRF</dt>
<dd>Pseudorandom number function, or sometimes
            called pseudorandom number generator (PRNG). An algorithm for
            generating a sequence of numbers that approximates the properties
            of random numbers. The sequence is not truly random, in that it is
            completely determined by a relatively small set of initial values
            that are passed into the function. An exmaple is SHA-256.

<dt>KDF</dt>
<dd>Key derivation function. A particular specified
            use of a PRF that takes a PSK, combines it with other inputs to
            the PRF, and produces a result that is suitable for use as a
            Traffic Key.

<dt>Identifier</dt>
<dd>The type and value used by one peer of an
            authenticated message exchange to signify to the other peer who
            they are. The Identifier is used by the receiver as a lookup index
            into a table containing further information about the peer that is
            required to continue processing the message, for example a
            Security Association (SA) or keys.

<dt>Identity Proof</dt>
<dd>A cryptographic proof for an asserted
            identity, that the peer really is who they assert themselves to
            be. Proof of identity can be arranged between the peers in a few
            ways, for example PSK, raw assymetric keys, or a more
            user-friendly representation of assymetric keys, like a
            certificate.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>Security Association or SA</dt>
<dd>The parameters and keys
            that together form the required information for processing secure
            sessions between peers. Examples of items that may exist in an SA
            include: Identifier, PSK, Traffic Key, cryptographic algorithms,
            key lifetimes.

<dt>KMP</dt>
<dd>Key Management Protocol. A protocol used between
            peers to exchange SA parameters and Traffic Keys. Examples of KMPs
            include IKE, TLS, and SSH.

<dt>Peer Key</dt>
<dd>Keys that are used between peers as the
            identity proof. These keys may or may not be connection specific,
            depending on who they were established, and what form of identity
            and identity proof is being used in the system.

<a name="rfc.section.1.3"></a><h3>1.3.&nbsp;
Scope</h3>

<p>
</p>
<p>Four basic tactics may be employed in order to secure any piece of
        data as it is transmitted over the wire: privacy (or encryption),
        authentication, message integrity, and non-repudiation. The focus for
        this effort, and the scope for this roadmap document, will be message
        authentication and packet integrity only. This work explicitly
        excludes, at this point in time, the other two tactics: privacy and
        non-repudiation. Since the objective of most routing protocols is to
        broadly advertise the routing topology, routing messages are commonly
        sent in the clear; confidentiality is not normally required for
        routing protocols. However, ensuring that routing peers truly are the
        trusted peers expected, and that no roque peers or messages can
        compromise the stability of the routing environment is critical, and
        thus our focus. The other two explicitly excluded tactics, privacy and
        non-repudiation, may be addressed in future work.
</p>
<p>It is possible for routing protocol packets to be transmitted
        employing all four security tactics mentioned above using existing
        standards. For example, one could run unicast, layer 3 or above
        routing protocol packets through <a class='info' href='#RFC4303'>IPsec
        ESP<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kent, S., &ldquo;IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP),&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4303]. This would provide the added benefit of privacy, and
        non-repudiation. However, router platforms and systems have been fine
        tuned over the years for the specific processing necessary for routing
        protocols' non-encapsulated formats. Operators are, therefore, quite
        reluctant to explore new packet encapsulations for these tried and
        true protocols.
</p>
<p>In addition, at least in the case of OSPF, LDP, and RIP, these
        protocols already have existing mechanisms for cryptographically
        authenticating and integrity checking the packets on the wire.
        Products with these mechanisms have already been produced, code has
        already been written and both have been optimized for the existing
        mechanisms. Rather than turn away from these mechanisms, we want to
        enhance them, updating them to modern and secure levels.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the scope of this roadmap of work includes:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>o</dt>
<dd>Making use of existing routing protocol security
            protocols, where they exist, and enhancing or updating them as
            necessary for modern cryptographic best practices,

<dd>
</dd>
<dt>o</dt>
<dd>Developing a framework for using automatic key

</dd>
<dt>o</dt>
<dd>Specifying the automated key management protocol
            that may be combined with the bits-on-the-wire mechanisms.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>The work also serves as an agreement between the Routing Area and
        the Security Area about the priorities and work plan for incrementally
        delivering the above work. This point is important. There will be
        times when the best-security-possible will give way to
        vastly-improved-over-current-security-but-admittedly-not-yet-best-security-possible,
        in order that incremental progress toward a more secure Internet may
        be achieved. As such, this document will call out places where
        agreement has been reached on such trade offs.
</p>
<p>This document does not contain protocol specifications. Instead, it
        defines the areas where protocol specification work is needed and sets
        a direction, a set of requirements, and a relative priority for
        addressing that specification work.
</p>
<p>There are a set of threats to routing protocols that are considered
        in-scope for this document/roadmap, and a set considered out-of-scope.
        These are described in detail in the <a class='info' href='#Threats'>Threats<span> (</span><span class='info'>Threats</span><span>)</span></a> section below.

Goals</h3>

<p>The goals and general guidance for the KARP work follow:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>1.</dt>
<dd>Provide authentication and integrity protection
            for packets on the wire of existing routing protocols
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>2.</dt>
<dd>Deliver a path to incrementally improve security
            of the routing infrastructure. The principle of crawl, walk, run
            will be in place. Routing protocol authentication mechanisms may
            not go immediately from their current state to a state containing
            the best possible, most modern security practices. Incremental
            steps will need to be taken for a few very practical reasons.
            First, there are a considerable number of deployed routing devices
            in operating networks that will not be able to run the most modern
            cryptographic mechanisms without significant and unacceptable
            performance penalties. The roadmap for any one routing protocol
            MUST allow for incremental improvements on existing operational
            devices. Second, current routing protocol performance on deployed
            devices has been achieved over the last 20 years through extensive
            tuning of software and hardware elements, and is a constant focus
            for improvement by vendors and operators alike. The introduction
            of new security mechanisms affects this performance balance. The
            performance impact of any incremental step of security improvement
            will need to be weighed by the community, and introduced in such a
            way that allows the vendor and operator community a path to
            adoption that upholds reasonable performance metrics. Therefore,
            certain specification elements may be introduced carrying the
            "SHOULD" guidance, with the intention that the same mechanism will
            carry a "MUST" in the next release of the specification. This
            gives the vendors and implementors the guidance they need to tune
            their software and hardware appropriately over time. Last, some
            security mechanisms require the build out of other operational
            support systems, and this will take time. An example where these
            three reasons are at play in an incremental improvement roadmap is
            seen in the improvement of <a class='info' href='#RFC4271'>BGP's<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rekhter, Y., Li, T., and S. Hares, &ldquo;A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4),&rdquo; January&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4271]
            security via the update of the TCP Authentication Option <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-tcpm-tcp-auth-opt'>(TCP-AO)<span> (</span><span class='info'>Touch, J., Mankin, A., and R. Bonica, &ldquo;The TCP Authentication Option,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;tcpm&#8209;tcp&#8209;auth&#8209;opt] effort. It
            would be ideal, and reflect best common security practice, to have
            a fully specified key management protocol for negotiating TCP-AO's
            authentication material, using certificates for peer
            authentication in the keying. However, in the spirit of
            incremental deployment, we will first address issues like
            cryptographic algorithm agility, replay attacks, TCP session
            resetting in the base TCP-AO protocol before we layer key
            management on top of it.

<dd>The deploy-ability of the improved security
            solutions on currently running routing infrastructure equipment.
            This begs the consideration of the current state of processing
            power available on routers in the network today.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>4.</dt>
<dd>Operational deploy-ability - A solutions
            acceptability will also be measured by how deployable the solution
            is by common operator teams using common deployment processes and
            infrastructures. I.e. We will try to make these solutions fit as
            well as possible into current operational practices or router
            deployment. This will be heavily influenced by operator input, to
            ensure that what we specify can -- and, more importantly, will --
            be deployed once specified and implemented by vendors. Deployment
            of incrementally more secure routing infrastructure in the
            Internet is the final measure of success. Measurably, we would
            like to see an increase in the number of surveyed respondents who
            report deploying the updated authentication mechanisms anywhere
            across their network, as well as a sharp rise in usage for the
            total percentage of their network's routers.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>Interviews with operators show several points about routing
            security. First, over 70% of operators have deployed transport
            connection protection via TCP-MD5 on their EBGP <a class='info' href='#ISR2008'>[ISR2008]<span> (</span><span class='info'>McPherson, D. and C. Labovitz, &ldquo;Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> . Over 55% also deploy MD5 on their IBGP
            connections, and 50% deploy MD5 on some other IGP. The survey
            states that "a considerable increase was observed over previous
            editions of the survey for use of TCP MD5 with external peers
            (eBGP), internal peers (iBGP) and MD5 extensions for IGPs." Though
            the data is not captured in the report, the authors believe
            anecdotally that of those who have deployed MD5 somewhere in their
            network, only about 25-30% of the routers in their network are
            deployed with the authentication enabled. None report using IPsec
            to protect the routing protocol, and this was a decline from the
            few that reported doing so in the previous year's report.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>From my personal conversations with operators, of those using
            MD5, almost all report deploying with one single manual key
            throughout the entire network. These same operators report that
            the one single key has not been changed since it was originally
            installed, sometimes five or more years ago. When asked why,
            particularly for the case of BGP using TCP MD5, the following
            reasons are often given:
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>A.</dt>
<dd>Changing the keys triggers a TCP reset, and thus bounces
                the links/adjacencies, undermining Service Level Agreements
                (SLAs).
</dd>
<dt>B.</dt>
<dd>For external peers, difficulty of coordination with the
                other organization is an issue. Once they find the correct
                contact at the other organization (not always so easy), the
                coordination function is serialized and on a per peer/AS
                basis. The coordination is very cumbersome and tedious to
                execute in practice.
</dd>
<dt>C.</dt>
<dd>Keys must be changed at precisely the same time, or at
                least within 60 seconds (as supported by two major vendors) in
                order to limit connectivity outage duration. This is
                incredibly difficult to do, operationally, especially between
                different organizations.
</dd>
<dt>D.</dt>
<dd>Relatively low priority compared to other operatoinal
                issues.
</dd>
<dt>E.</dt>
<dd>Lack of staff to implement the changes device by
                device.
</dd>
<dt>F.</dt>
<dd>There are three use cases for operational peering at play
                here: peers and interconnection with other operators, Internal
                BGP and other routing sessions within a single operator, and
                operator-to-customer-CPE devices. All three have very
                different properties, and all are reported as cumbersome. One
                operator reported that the same key is used for all customer
                premise equipment. The same operator reported that if the
                customer mandated, a unique key could be created, although the
                last time this occurred it created such an operational
                headache that the administrators now usually tell customers
                that the option doesn't even exist, to avoid the difficulties.
                These customer-uniqe keys are never changed, unless the
                customer demands so.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>The main threat at play here is that a terminated employee from
            such an operator who had access to the one (or few) keys used for
            authentication in these environments could easily wage an attack
            -- or offer the keys to others who would wage the attack -- and
            bring down many of the adjacencies, causing destabilization to the
            routing system.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>Whatever mechanisms we specify need to be easier than the
            current methods to deploy, and should provide obvious operational
            efficiency gains along with significantly better security and
            threat protection. This combination of value may be enough to
            drive much broader adoption.

<dt></dt>

<dd>Address the threats enumerated above in the <a class='info' href='#Threats'>"Threats" section<span> (</span><span class='info'>Threats</span><span>)</span></a> for each routing
            protocol, along a roadmap. Not all threats may be able to be
            addressed in the first specification update for any one protocol.
            Roadmaps will be defined so that both the security area and the
            routing area agree on how the threats will be addressed completely
            over time.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>6.</dt>
<dd>Create a re-usable architecture, framework, and
            guidelines for various IETF working teams who will address these
            security improvements for various Routing Protocols. The crux of
            the KARP work is to re-use that framework as much as possible
            across relevant Routing Protocols. For example, designers should
            aim to re-use the key management protocol that will be defined for
            BGP's TCP-AO key establishment for as many other routing protocols
            as possible. This is but one example.

<p>The threats that will be addressed in this roadmap are those from
        OUTSIDERS, attackers that may reside anywhere in the Internet, have
        the ability to send IP traffic to the router, may be able to observe
        the router's replies, and may even control the path for a legitimate
        peer's traffic. These are not legitimate participants in the routing
        protocol. Message authentication and integrity protection specifically
        aims to identify messages originating from OUTSIDERS.

<p>The concept of OUTSIDERS can be further refined to include

            addition to several other attack classes. A man-in-the-middle
            (MitM) attack occurs when an attacker who has access to packets
            flowing between two peers tampers with those packets in such a way
            that both peers think they are talking to each other directly,
            when in fact they are actually talking to the attacker only.
            Protocols conforming to this roadmap will use cryptographic
            mechanisms to prevent a man-in-the-middle attacker from situating
            himself undetected.

<dd>Terminated Employees - in this context, those who
            had access router configuration that included keys or keying
            material like pre-shared keys used in securing the routing
            protocol. Using this material, the attacker could send properly
            MAC'd spoofed packets appearing to come from router A to router B,
            and thus impersonate an authorized peer. The attacker could then
            send false traffic that changes the network behavior from its
            operator's design. The goal of addressing this source specifically
            is to call out the case where new keys or keying material becomes
            necessary very quickly, with little operational expense, upon the
            termination of such an employee. This grouping could also refer to
            any attacker who somehow managed to gain access to keying
            material, and said access had been detected by the operators such
            that the operators have an opportunity to move to new keys in
            order to prevent an attack.

            of network services. Spoofing can also be used to cause a neighbor

<dd>FALSIFICATION - an action whereby an attacker
            sends false routing information. To falsify the routing
            information, an attacker has to be either the originator or a
            forwarder of the routing information. Falsification may occur by
            an ORIGINATOR, or a FORWARDER, and may involve OVERCLAIMING,
            MISCLAIMING, or MISTATEMENT of network resource reachability. We
            must be careful to remember that in this work we are only
            targeting falsification from outsiders as may occur from tampering
            with packets in flight. Falsification from BYZANTINES (see the

<dd>DoS attacks on transport sub-systems - This

            attack types. This is when an attacker sends spoofed packets aimed
            at halting or preventing the underlying protocol over which the
            routing protocol runs, for example halting a BGP session by
            sending a TCP FIN or RST packet. Since this attack depends on
            spoofing, operators are encouraged to deploy

<dt>o</dt>
<dd>DoS attacks using the authentication mechanism -
            This includes an attacker sending packets which confuse or
            overwhelm a security mechanism itself. An example is initiating an
            overwhelming load of spoofed authenticated route messages so that
            the receiver needs to process the MAC check, only to discard the
            packet, sending CPU levels rising. Another example is when an
            attacker sends an overwhelming load of keying protocol initiations
            from bogus sources. All other possible DoS attacks are out of
            scope (see next section).

<dd>Brute Foce Attacks Against Password/Keys - This
            includes either online or offline attacks where attempts are made
            repeatedly using different keys/passwords until a match is found.
            While it is impossible to make brute force attacks on keys
            completely unsuccessful, proper design can make such attacks much
            harder to succeed. For exmaple, the key length should be
            sufficiently long so that covering the entire space of possible
            keys is improbable using computational power expected to be
            available 10 years out or more. Also, frequently changing the keys
            may render useless a successful guess some time in the future, as
            those keys may no longer be in use.

</p>
<p>Threats from BYZANTINE sources -- faulty, misconfigured, or

        protocol -- are out of scope for this roadmap. Any of the attacks

        that may be levied by a BYZANTINE source are therefore also out of
        scope.

<p>In addition, these other attack actions are out of scope for this

</p>
<p>
          </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>SNIFFING - passive observation of route message contents in

<li>FALSIFICATION by BYZANTINE sources - unauthorized message

<li>NOT FORWARDING PACKETS - cannot be prevented with

Requirements for Phase 1 of a Routing Protocol Transport's Security Update</h3>

<p>The following list of requirements SHOULD be addressed by a KARP Work
      Phase 1 security update to any Routing Protocol (according to section
      4.1 of the <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-karp-design-guide'>KARP Design
      Guide<span> (</span><span class='info'>Lebovitz, G. and M. Bhatia, &ldquo;Keying and Authentication for Routing Protocols (KARP) Design Guidelines,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> [I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;karp&#8209;design&#8209;guide] document). IT IS RECOMMENDED that any Phase 1 security
      update to a Rouing Protocol contain a section of the specification
      document that describes how each of these requirements are met. It is
      further RECOMMENDED that textual justification be presented for any
      requirements that are NOT addressed.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Clear definitions of which elements of the transmission (frame,
          packet, segment, etc.) are protected by the authentication
          mechanism
</li>
<li>Strong algorithms, and defined and accepted by the security
          community, MUST be specified. The option should use algorithms
          considered accepted by the IETF's Security community, which are
          considered appropriately safe. The use of non-standard or
          unpublished algorithms SHOULD BE avoided.
</li>
<li>Algorithm agility for the cryptograhpic algorithms used in the
          authentication MUST be specified, i.e. more than one algorithm MUST
          be specified and it MUST be clear how new algorithms MAY be
          specified and used within the protocol. This requirement exists in
          case one algorithm gets broken suddenly. Research to identify
          weakness in algorithms is constant. Breaking a cipher isn't a matter
          of if, but when it will occur. It's highly unlikely that two
          different algorithms will be broken simultaneously. So, if two are
          supported, and one gets broken, we can use the other until we get a
          new one in place. Having the ability within the protocol
          specification to support such an event, having algorithm agility, is
          essential. Mandating two algorithms provides both a redundancy, and
          a mechanism for enacting that redundancy when needed. Further, the
          mechanism MUST describe the generic interface for new cryptographic
          algorithms to be used, so that implementers can use algorithms other
          than those specified, and so that new algorithms may be specifed and
          supported in the future.
</li>
<li>Secure use of simple PSKs, offering both operational convenience
          as well as building something of a fence around stupidity, MUST be
          specified.
</li>
<li>Inter-connection replay protection. Packets captured from one
          connection MUST NOT be able to be re-sent and accepted during a
          later connection.
</li>
<li>Intra-connection replay protection. Packets captured during a
          connection MUST NOT be able to be re-sent and accepted during that
          same connection, to deal with long-lived connections. Additionally,
          replay mechanisms MUST work correctly even in the presence of
          Routing Protocol packet prioritization by the router (see
          requirement 17 below).
</li>
<li>A change of security parameters REQUIRES, and even forces, a
          change of session traffic keys
</li>
<li>Intra-connection re-keying which occurs without a break or
          interruption to the current peering session, and, if possible,
          without data loss, MUST be specified. Keys need to be changed
          periodically, for operational privacey (e.g. when an administrator
          who had access to the keys leaves an organization) and for entropy
          purposes, and a re-keying mechanism enables the deployers to execute
          the change without productivity loss.
</li>
<li>Efficient re-keying SHOULD be provided. The specificaion SHOULD
          support rekeying during a connection without the need to expend
          undue computational resources. In particular, the specification
          SHOULD avoid the need to try/compute multiple keys on a given
          packet.
</li>
<li>Prevent DoS attacks as those described as in-scope in the threats
          section <a class='info' href='#ThreatInScope'>Section&nbsp;2.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Threats In Scope</span><span>)</span></a> above.
</li>
<li>Default mechanisms and algorithms specified and defined are
          REQUIRED for all implementations.
</li>
<li>Manual keying MUST be supported.
</li>
<li>Architecture of the specification MUST consider and allow for
          future use of a KMP.
</li>
<li>The authentication mechanism in the Routing Protocol MUST be
          decoupled from the key management system used. It MUST be obvious
          how the keying material was obtained, and the process for obtaining
          the keying material MUST exist outside of the Routing Protocol. This
          will allow for the various key generation methods, like manual keys
          and KMPs, to be used with the same Routing Protocol mechanism.
</li>
<li>Convergence times of the Routing Protocols SHOULD NOT be
          materially affected. Materially here is defined as anything greater
          than a 5% convergence time increase. Note that convergence is
          different than boot time. Also note that convergence time has a lot
          to do with the speed of processors used on individual routing peers,
          and this processing power increases by Moore's law over time,
          meaning that the same route calculations and table population
          routines will decrease in duration over time. Therefore, this
          requirement should be considered only in terms of total number of
          messages that must be exchanged, and less for the computational
          intensity of processing any one message.
</li>
<li>The changes or addition of security mechanisms SHOULD NOT cause a
          refresh of route updates or cause additional route updates to be
          generated.
</li>
<li>Router implementations provide prioritized treament to certain
          protocol packets. For example, OSPF HELLO messages and ACKs are
          prioritized for processing above other OSPF packets. The
          authentication mechanism SHOULD NOT interfere with the ability to
          observe and enforce such prioritizations. Any effect on such
          priority mechanisms MUST be explicitly documented and justified.
</li>
<li>The authentication mechanism does not provide message
          confidentiality, but SHOULD NOT preclude the possibility of
          confidentiality support being added in the future.
</li>
<li>The KARP mechanism MUST provide a sufficiently large sequence
          number space so that intra-connection replay protection will
          succeed. [Editor note: This may be more of a design guide item than
          a requirement? Also, it may be best to include it with 3.6?]
</li>
<li>The new security and authentication mechanisms MUST support
          incremental deployment. It will not be feasible to deploy a new
          Routing Protocol authentication mechanism throughout the network
          instantaneously. It also may not be possible to deploy such a
          mechanism to all routers in a large autonomous system (AS) at one
          time. Proposed solutions SHOULD support an incremental deployment
          method that provides some benefit for those who participate. Because
          of this, there are several requirements that any proposed KARP
          mechanism should consider.
</li>
<li>
<ol class="text">
<li>The Routing Protocol security mechanism MUST enable each
              router to configure use of the security mechanism on a per-peer
              basis where the communication is one-on-one.
</li>
<li>The new KARP mechanism MUST provide backward compatibility in
              the message formatting, transmission, and processing of routing
              information carried through a mixed security environment.
              Message formatting in a fully secured environment MAY be handled
              in a non-backward compatible fashion though care must be taken
              to ensure that routing protocol packets can traverse
              intermediate routers which don't support the new format.
</li>
<li>In an environment where both secured and non-secured systems
              are interoperating a mechanism MUST exist for secured systems to
              identify whether an originator intended the information to be
              secured.
</li>
<li>In an environment where secured service is in the process of
              being deployed a mechanism MUST exist to support a transition
              free of service interruption (caused by the deployment per
              se).
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The introduction of mechanisms to improve routing authentication
          and security may increase the processing performed by a router.
          Since most of the currently deployed routers do not have hardware to
          accelerate cryptographic operations, these operations could impose a
          significant processing burden under some circumstances. Thus
          proposed solutions should be evaluated carefully with regard to the
          processing burden they may impose, since deployment may be impeded
          if network operators perceive that a solution will impose a
          processing burden which either:
</li>
<li>
<ul class="text">
<li>provokes substantial capital expense, or
</li>
<li>threatens to destabilize routers.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Given the high number of routers that would require the new
          authentication mechanisms in a typical ISP deployment, solutions can
          increase their appeal by minimizing the burden imposed on all
          routers in favor of confining significant work loads to a relatively
          small number of devices. Optional features or increased assurance
          that provokes more pervasive processing load MAY be made available
          for deployments where the additional resources are economically
          justifiable.
</li>
<li>The new authentication and security mechanisms should not rely on
          systems external to the routing system (the equipment that is
          performing forwarding). In order to ensure the rapid initialization
          and/or return to service of failed nodes it is important to reduce
          reliance on these external systems to the greatest extent possible.
          Therefore, proposed solutions SHOULD NOT require connections to
          external systems, beyond those directly involved in peering
          relationships, in order to return to full service. It is however
          acceptable for the proposed solutions to require post initialization
          synchronization with external systems in order to fully synchronize
          the security information.
