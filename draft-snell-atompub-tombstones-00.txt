Internet-Draft               Atom Tombstones               November 2005


1.  Introduction

   This specification defines mechanisms in the form of Atom Format
   [RFC4287] extensions that Atom Feed publishers can use to explicitly
   indicate that specific Atom Entries have been removed from a feed due
   to deletion or archiving.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119]

   This specification uses XML Namespaces [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114]
   to uniquely identify XML element names.  It uses the following
   namespace prefix for the indicated namespace URI;

   {Ed.  Note: this namespace MUST be changed to a proper IETF namespace
   scheme prior to publication}

    "at": "http://purl.org/atompub/tombstones/1.0"


3.  The 'deleted-entry' element

   The 'deleted-entry' element MAY appear as a child of atom:feed to
   represent an Atom Entry that has been removed from the feed due to
   deletion.  The element consists of a required 'id' attribute whose
   value specifies the universally unique atom:id value of the deleted
   entry and an optional 'when' attribute whose value is an Atom Date
   Construct specifying the instant the entry was deleted.

     deletedEntry = element at:deleted-entry {
       atomCommonAttributes,
       & attribute id { atomURI },
       & attribute when { atomDateConstruct }?,
       ( by?,
       & comment*,
       & undefinedContent )
     }

   Atom Processors MUST ignore 'deleted-entry' elements whose 'id'
   attributes reference Atom Entries that have not previously appeared
   within the Atom Feed document.

   The 'deleted-entry' element MAY contain a 'by' element that
   identifies the entity that deleted the entry.

   The 'deleted-entry' element MAY contain zero or more 'comment'
   elements whose content provides additional information about the
   deletion operation.

   Atom Feed Documents MAY contain any number of 'deleted-entry'
   elements.

     <feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
        ...
        <at:deleted-entry
          id="tag:example.org,2005:/entries/1"
          when="2005-11-29T12:12:12Z">
          <at:by>
            <name>John Doe</name>
            <email>jdoe@example.org</email>
          </at:by>
          <at:comment>Removed comment spam</at:comment>
        </at:deleted-entry>
        <at:deleted-entry
          id="tag:example.org,2005:/entries/2"
          when="2005-11-29T12:11:12Z">
          <at:by>
            <name>John Doe</name>
            <email>jdoe@example.org</email>
          </at:by>
          <at:comment>Removed comment spam</at:comment>
        </at:deleted-entry>
        ...
     </feed>


4.  The 'archived-entry' element

   The 'archived-entry' element MAY appear as a child of atom:feed to
   represent an Atom Entry that has been removed from the feed due to
   archiving.  The element consists of a required 'id' attrubute whose
   value specifies the universally unique atom:id value of the archived
   entry, a required 'href' attribute whose value specifies the IRI from
   which the archived Atom Entry Document MAY be retrieved, and an
   optional 'when' attribute whose value is an Atom Date Construct
   specifying the instant the entry was archived.

     archivedEntry = element at:archived-entry {
       atomCommonAttributes,
       & attribute id { atomURI },
       & attribute href { atomURI },
       & attribute when { atomDateConstruct }?,
       ( by?,
       & comment*,
       & undefinedContent )
     }

   The 'archived-entry' element MAY contain a 'by' element that
   identifies the entity that archived the entry.

   The 'archived-entry' element MAY contain zero or more 'comment'
   elements whose content provides additional information about the
   archival operation.

   Atom Processors MUST ignore 'archived-entry' elements whose 'id'
   attributes reference Atom Entries that have not previously appeared
   within the Atom Feed document.

   Atom Feed Documents MAY contain any number of 'archived-entry'
   elements.

     <feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
        ...
        <at:archived-entry
          id="tag:example.org,2005:/entries/1"
          href="http://example.org/archives/1"
          when="2005-11-29T12:12:12Z">
          <at:by>
            <name>Automated Archive Process</name>
          </at:by>
        </at:archived-entry>
        <at:archived-entry
          id="tag:example.org,2005:/entries/2"
          href="http://example.org/archives/2"
          when="2005-11-29T12:11:12Z">
          <at:by>
            <name>Automated Archive Process</name>
          </at:by>
        </at:archived-entry>
        ...
     </feed>

5.  The 'by' Element

   The 'by' element is an Atom Person Construct that is used to identify
   the entity that performed a deletion or archive operation on an
   entry.

     by = element at:by { atomPersonConstruct }


6.  The 'comment' Element

   The 'comment' element in an Atom Text Construct that is used to
   provide additional human readable information about a deletion or
   archive operation on an entry.

     comment = element at:comment { atomTextConstruct }


7.  Security Considerations

   As specified in [RFC4287], Atom processors should be aware of the
   potential for spoofing attacks where an attacked publishes atom:entry
   elements with the same atom:id value of entries from other Atom
   feeds.  The same potential exists with the mechanisms defined here in
   that an attacker may attempt to spoof an application into believing
   that a given entry has been removed from a feed.  To mitigate this
   issue, Atom processors MUST ignore 'deleted-entry' and 'archived-
   entry' elements referencing entries that have not previously appeared
   within the containing Feed document and should take steps to verify
   the origin of the Atom feed before considering the entries to be
   removed.


8.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations introduced by this specification.
