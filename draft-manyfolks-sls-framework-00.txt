1.0 Introduction

   This document presents a framework for Service Level Specification
   and Usage. Today, instantiation of service levels between customers
   and providers is a rather static and labour intensive task. It is to
   be understood that standardization of the basic process may allow for
   a highly developed level of automation and dynamic negotiation of
   Service Level Specifications between customers and providers.  This
   automation may prove helpful in providing customers (as well as
   providers) the technical means for the dynamic provisioning of
   quality of service. The automation in itself is e.g. necessary to
   allow roaming (dial-in) users and mobile users to have access and
   negotiate a transport Service Level, independent of their point of
   attachment to the network.

   Further, the design and the deployment of a service negotiation
   infrastructure in a multi-vendor / multi-provider environment
   requires a standardized set of semantics for Service Level
   Specifications being negotiated at different locations:

      - between the customer and the service provider (namely between
      the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) and its point of attachment



Manyfolks                 Expires April, 2001                   [Page 2]

      to the IP network managed by the service provider);

      - within an administrative domain (for intra-domain transport
      service negotiation purposes);

      - between administrative domains (for inter-domain transport
      service negotiation purposes).

   The document is structured as follows.

   Chapter 2 provides an terminology and definition set used in the
   description of the framework.

   Chapter 3 extends on the aspects involved in Service management.

   Chapter 4 positions this work in the context of ongoing
   standardization efforts at the level of the IETF.

   Chapter 5 provides an overview of related activities that can either
   directly or indirectly contribute to a standardized architecture for
   service negotiation across the Internet.

   [ed. note : I have brought together input from different sources for
   this first version, and some wordsmithing and alignment in
   terminology is still required. At some points I have left some
   editorial notes to guide comments/contributions]

2.0 Terminology

   [ed. note : we need to flesh out some of the terminology to avoid
   conflicts with other workgroups/efforts]

   A transport domain is a set of one or more autonomous systems that
   together provide transport services beyond best effort to customer
   networks. A transport domain consists of a set of routers that are
   connected by internal interfaces, and that offer transport services
   to customer networks at its external interfaces.

   The ingress interface is the external interface where datagrams enter
   the transport subdomain.

   The egress interface is the external interface where datagrams leave
   the transport subdomain.

   The Service offering entity is further referred to as the Provider.

   An IP flow is a set of correlated IP datagrams that share at least
   one common characteristic, like the same protocol identifier, the



Manyfolks                 Expires April, 2001                   [Page 3]

Internet Draft    draft-manyfolks-sls-framework-00.txt     October, 2000


   same DSCP (DiffServ Code Point, [RFC-2474]) value, etc.

   A Service Level Specification (template) is a protocol independent
   representation of a set of technical parameters and their associated
   semantics that describe the transport service a flow is to receive
   over the transport domain, between ingress and egress interfaces.

   A Service Level Object is a protocol dependent instantiation of a
   Service Level Specification, that is to say, it contains the
   parameters and their values that describe the transport service a
   specified flow is to receive over the transport domain.

   A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a contractual document which a
   subscriber and a service provider have agreed upon.

   A subscriber (or a Customer) is a legal representative who has the
   (legal) ability to subscribe to a service offering.

   A user is an entity (a human being or a process, from a general
   perspective) who has been named by a subscriber and appropriately
   identified by a service provider, so that he might benefit from a
   service according to his associated rights and duties.

   A Transport Service consists of a set of Service Level Objects, that
   should be taken atomically when negotiating a service that pertains
   to multiple flows at once. (e.g., a bidirectional service). A
   Transport Service is part of the Service Level Agreement.

   A Transport Service is further denoted as the Service.

3.0 Service Management

   Service Management concerns the definition and negotiation of
   Services between the customer/user and the provider. Section 3.1
   describes the definition of a Service, while section 3.2 elaborates
   on the negotiation of Services between the Customer/User and the
   Provider. Finally section 3.3 elaborates the reference points in the
   Internet where service negotiation may apply.

3.1 The Service Model

   A Service Level Specification (SLS) template is a protocol
   independent representation of a set of technical parameters and their
   associated semantics that describe the transport service a flow is to
   receive over the transport domain, between ingress and egress
   interfaces. The description of these parameters is the subject of
   draft-tequila-sls-00.txt [SLS], and the reader is referred to
   [TEQUILA] for further information. Note that this work is presently



Manyfolks                 Expires April, 2001                   [Page 4]

Internet Draft    draft-manyfolks-sls-framework-00.txt     October, 2000


   limited to unidirectional flows.

   A Service Level Object (SLO) is a protocol dependent instantiation of
   a Service Level Specification, that is to say, it contains the
   parameters and their values that describe the transport service a
   specified flow is to receive over the transport domain. This
   framework does not assume the use of any particular protocol for the
   negotiation (subscription or invocation).

   A Transport Service consists of a set of Service Level Objects, that
   should be taken atomically when negotiating a service that pertains
   to multiple flows at once. (e.g., a bidirectional service.)

3.2 Service Negotiation Process

   This framework assumes the Service negotiation process to be composed
   of a Service Subscription, and a Service Invocation phase.

   Service Subscription can be loosely defined as the process of
   negotiating the right to invoke one or more Transport Services at a
   later time, Service Subscription is a process between a Subscriber
   and a Provider.

   Service Invocation refers to the process of actually requesting an
   amount of resources as described in a (different) Transport Service,
   Service Invocation is a process between a User and a Provider. Note
   that the allocation of resources to the user does not have to be
   immediate, but can be subject to a service schedule as parameter of a
   Transport Service/ Service Level Object.

   Note that the administrative entity performing Service Subscription
   (i.e., the Subscriber) does not have to be the same administrative
   entity as the one performing Service Invocation (i.e., the User).
   E.g., a video service provider (or more general, an application
   service provider), can assume the role of Subscriber to the provider
   of the transport domain, on behalf of the end-user of the video
   services. The actual invocation of the transport service could then
   be triggered by the end-user application.

   The parameters involved in Service Subscription do not necessarily
   have to be the same as these used in Service Invocation. More
   generically, the parameters involved in Service Invocation can be
   said to be in-range or out-of-range of the set of parameters that
   pertain to the Service subscription process. The acceptance of
   Service Invocations that are out-of-range is a policy left to the
   providers.

   Note that the Service subscription process may be augmented with a



Manyfolks                 Expires April, 2001                   [Page 5]

Internet Draft    draft-manyfolks-sls-framework-00.txt     October, 2000


   set of parameters that describe the likelyhood of accepting a Service
   invocation at a later time (e.g., invocation blocking probability).
   This invocation blocking probability may be derived from the set of
   Subscribed services that allready apply to the external (user)
   interface, or to the overall set of services that have been
   subscribed over the full transport domain.

   Although both subscription and invocation are here described as
   separate processes, invocation may be allowed in combination with
   subscription, that would make the service negotiation one atomic
   action.

   Note that the negotiation of services accross the transport domain,
   may require a recursive level of service (pre-)negotiation between
   the sub-transport domains that make up the overall transport domain.
   This is often denoted as the provider - provider negotiation process.

   The services negotiation between customer A and provider B, may yield
   an additional (not necessarily) symmetric Service negotiation between
   Provider B and Customer C, so that protection of denial of service
   attacks may appropriately be enforced, for example.

3.3 Service Negotiation Interface

   A standardized approach to Service Negotiation is required, according
   to the following transport domain taxonomy effort. Indeed, the
   transport domain can be composed of a single domain (i.e. a set of IP
   routers being managed by a globally unique and administrative entity,
   as per [RFC-1771]), or of a set of administrative domains.

3.3.1 Intra-domain

   Service negotiation may be provided over intra-domain interfaces, a
   typical example being application servers requesting particular
   transport services on behalf of its end-users. E.g., a VPN manager,
   H.323 GK, Media Gateway Controllers or other. This is particularly so
   when the transport provider and the application service provider are
   the same administrative entity.

3.3.2 Inter-domain

   Service negotiation can cross an administrative boundary, such as the
   customer - Transport Service Provider interface, or between Transport
   Service Providers. The request for interdomain Customer Services
   (these for which one or more of the interfaces referred to in the
   scope of a Service Level Object are not in the same (sub-)transport
   domain) may involve a recursive set of Transport Service contracts
   between a concatenation of transport providers on the route between

Internet Draft    draft-manyfolks-sls-framework-00.txt     October, 2000


   ingress and egress interfaces.

   Another example would be where the transport provider and the
   application service provider would be two distinct administrative
   entities, e.g., a IP Telephone Service Provider that wants to connect
   a number of media gateways over the transport provider's network, and
   would like some automated level of trunk dimensioning/installation.

   honour the services negotiated by both peers. They are provided  here
   to  offer  the reader an overview of how the work referred to in this
   document relates to other ongoing activity within the IETF.

   The role of traffic engineering is to configure the network so as  to
   allow   the  network  to  provide  the  services  negotiated  by  the
   customers. Traffic  engineering  may  largely  be  described  as  the
   process   of  network  planning  and  dimensioning,  path  selection,
   (implicit  or  explicit)  path  establishment,  and   path   resource
   reservation.  A  framework for traffic engineering in the internet is
   provided in [TE]. The latter however does not yet cover  the  subject
   of  QoS enhanced traffic engineering for diffserv networks. Note that
   the routing process (both intra- and interdomain are to  be  seen  as
   part of the traffic engineering function).

   The role of traffic conditioning is to execute a set  of  actions  to
   conform  traffic  to a certain traffic contract as negotiated between
   the  customer  and  the  provider.  It  typically  involves  shaping,
   remarking or dropping of datagrams at the ingress or egress to/from a
   transport domain.

   Traffic management involves scheduling and buffer management so as to
   service  datagrams  according to the service level negotiated between
   the User and the Provider. Traffic conditioning is often  seen  as  a
   function   at  the  edge  of  the  transport  domain,  while  traffic
   management would be required at each individual hop in the  transport
   domain.

   Both traffic conditioning and traffic management are covered  by  the
   diffserv   wg   [DIFFSERV].   Note  that  a  specific  interface  for
   configuring  both  traffic  conditioning   and   traffic   management
   parameters  is  under specification by the rap wg [RAP], this work is
   also  known  as  COPS  (Common  Open   Policy   Service   [RFC-2748])
   provisioning  for  diffserv  networks  [PIBDS], similarly, use can be
   made of SNMP [MIBDS].

   The negotiation of services may be subject to policy control  by  the
   provider.   A   framework  for  policy  control  is  currently  under
   investigation by the policy framework group. The reader  is  referred
   to  [POLICY]  for an overview of the latter. Note that quite a number
   of parameters that are today described as part of the  SLS  template,
   can  also  be  retrieved  in  the protocol independent representation
   model  for  diffserv  network  operation  discussed  in  the   Policy
   Framework  group.  More specifically, these parameters that relate to
   the configuration of traffic management and  conditioning  parameters
   at  the edge of the transport domain. As such it may be expected that
   the protocol independent definition of  a  SLS  can  be  seen  as  an
   extension to this work.

   Negotiation  of  services  invokes  the  dual  concept   of   service
   monitoring,  in  the end, an agreed framework should exist to qualify
   that the Service instantiation is appropriately  enforced,  according
   to  the  parameters  as  agreed  within  the individual Service Level
   Objects. Currently, the IP Performance Measurements working group  of
   the IETF defines a set of parameters that quantitatively describe the
   properties of streams over IP networks. The  reader  is  referred  to
   [IPPM] for further information concerning measurements.

   Note that a very particular way of invoking services would be through
   the  use  of  RSVP  (Resource  Reservation Protocol, [RFC2205]) in an
   integrated services environment [INTSERV]. In this case, the  use  of
   the  RSVP  signalling  protocol  may  yield  the appropriate resource
   allocation in the transport domain, according to the  enforcement  of
   the  corresponding  Service  instantiation.  The interworking between
   intserv and diffserv domains, is presently covered in [ISSL].

5.0 Overview of ongoing efforts

5.1 Diffserv WG efforts

   The purpose of this section is to  present  an  overview  of  ongoing
   activities  which  are either directly related to SLSs or which could
   impact the SLS definition.

   The specification of SLSs is out of the scope of the Diffserv WG. The
   definition  of  PDBs (Per Domain Behaviour) [DSBA] could however have
   an impact on  the  SLS  definition.  According  to  [DSBA],  the  PDB
   describes  the  behaviour  experienced  by  packets  of  a particular
   traffic aggregate as they cross a Diffserv  domain.  A  PDB  will  be
   associated  with a set of rules that are enforced during the entry of
   packets in Diffserv domain and with measurable attributes to describe
   what  will happen to packets in crossing the domain. Similarly an SLS
   will describe the arrival of customer packets to the network and  how
   the network will handle them. It is important to keep in mind that in
   general the PDB definitions and their attributes are not expected  to
   be directly visible to customers at the SLS level.

   Another activity of the Diffserv working group is the  definition  of
   an  informal management model for Diffserv Routers [DSMOD] and of the
   corresponding formal MIB definition [MIBDS]. The router  capabilities
   (classification,  policing, metering...) are described defining a set
   of parameters and algorithms. The relationship of  these  definitions
   with  the corresponding definitions at SLS level should be taken into
   account.

5.2 Bandwidth Brokers

Internet Draft    draft-manyfolks-sls-framework-00.txt     October, 2000


   The Bandwidth Broker concept was first introduced  in  [2BIT].  There
   are several projects dealing with Bandwidth Broker architectures, see
   for example [CAN], [ITTC]. The communication between a Client  and  a
   Bandwidth Broker, or among two Bandwidth Brokers is always based on a
   form of SLS. In the context  of  the  Qbone  Internet2  project,  the
   Bandwidth  Broker  Working  Group  is  defining the architecture of a
   Bandwidth  Broker  and  a  protocol  for  inter-domain  communication
   between  Bandwidth  Brokers.  The current status of the definition of
   the Architecture and of  the  "Simple  Interdomain  Bandwidth  Broker
   Signalling" (SIBBS) is described in [QB-BB]. This document provides a
   definition of the SLS as being  "not  a  reservation,  but  rather  a
   commitment  to allow reservations (or a potential for reservations)",
   and leaves the formal description of this type  of  SLS  out  of  the
   scope  of  current  work.   The  definition  of SLS in [QB-BB] can be
   mapped in the "subscription SLS" discussed in this document. In  [QB-
   BB],  the  actual  reservation  is  carried  by SIBBS protocol in the
   "Resource Allocation Request" (RAR) messages.  RAR messages  contains
   "...the  space-time  coordinates  of the service, the kind of service
   (and  possibly  parameters  of  the   service)   and   possibly   the
   characteristics of the input...". The content of the RAR messages can
   be compared to the "invocation SLS" discussed in this document. It is
   worth  noting that the "kind of service" parameter in the RAR means a
   reference to a "Globally Well-known Service" (GWS) and that currently
   the  only  service under consideration is the "QBone Premium Service"
   (QPS).

   AT&T's Policy Arena is a policy based management approach to scalable
   management   networks,   aimed   at   automating   the  creation  and
   administration of end-to-end QoS services. An important component  of
   the Policy Arena approach is to allow customers to create, modify and
   manage QoS pipes or hoses across the provider's backbone, and receive
   customized   reports   on  the  performance  of  the  active  service
   instances. Towards this end, Policy Arena  comprises  of  independent
   policy  servers in the customer and provider networks which negotiate
   the attributes of  service  instantiation,  take  responsibility  for
   parsing  and  checking  parameters  for  correctness and consistency;
   distribute policies to various  network  devices  and  monitor  their
   enforcement.  To perform these roles, the policy layer includes a set
   of functions that provide monitoring, configuration  and  control  of
   both  the attributes of services and the policies governing them. The
   policy  layer  captures  users'  requirements,   device   independent
   configuration,   aggregates  device-state  information,  co-ordinates
   event notifications across various sub-systems,  and  in  some  cases
   "closes the loop" between monitoring and control.

5.3 Service Negotiation Interface efforts

   a  set  of  possible candidates is: PPP, RSVP, SIBBS, COPS, HTTP, XML
   based negotiation, CORBA. References to past or ongoing activities on
   some  of  these  approaches is given hereafter: [PPPSLA] describe the
   negotiation of SLA using  PPP;  the  SIBBS  interdomain  protocol  is
   described  in  [QB-BB];  an  intradomain solution using COPS has been
   proposed in [COPSODRA]; the MIAMI project [Reference??] used  an  XML
   based  negotiation,  the  AQUILA  project [AQUILA] is using CORBA for
   communicating reservation requests from the customer to an  admission
   control agent in the network.

   [ed. note : other efforts will be taken into account, when references
   and basic text are provided]
