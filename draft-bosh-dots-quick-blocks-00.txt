   Distributed Denial-of-Service Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) Signal
     Channel Configuration Attributes for Faster Block Transmission
                    draft-bosh-dots-quick-blocks-00

Abstract

   This document specifies new DOTS signal channel configuration
   parameters that are negotiated between DOTS peers to enable the use
   of Q-Block1 and Q-Block2 Options.  These options enable faster
   transmission rates for large amounts of data with less packet
   interchanges as well as supporting faster recovery should any of the
   blocks get lost in transmission.

1.  Introduction

   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252], although
   inspired by HTTP, was designed to use UDP instead of TCP.  The
   message layer of CoAP over UDP includes support for reliable
   delivery, simple congestion control, and flow control.  [RFC7959]
   introduced the CoAP Block1 and Block2 Options to handle data records
   that cannot fit in a single IP packet, so not having to rely on IP
   fragmentation and was further updated by [RFC8323] for use over TCP,
   TLS, and WebSockets.

   The CoAP Block1 and Block2 Options work well in environments where
   there are no or minimal packet losses.  These options operate
   synchronously where each individual block has to be requested and can
   only ask for (or send) the next block when the request for the
   previous block has completed.  Packet, and hence block transmission
   rate, is controlled by Round Trip Times (RTTs).

   There is a requirement for these blocks of data to be transmitted at
   higher rates under network conditions where there may be asymmetrical
   transient packet loss (i.e., responses may get dropped).  An example
   is when a network is subject to a Distributed Denial of Service
   (DDoS) attack and there is a need for DDoS mitigation agents relying
   upon CoAP to communicate with each other (e.g.,
   [I-D.ietf-dots-telemetry]).  As a reminder, [RFC7959] recommends the
   use of Confirmable (CON) responses to handle potential packet loss.

Internet-Draft        DOTS Fast Block Transmission          January 2021


   However, such a recommendation does not work with a flooded pipe DDoS
   situation.

   The block-wise transfer specified in [RFC7959] covers the general
   case, but falls short in situations where packet loss is highly
   asymmetrical.  The mechanism specified in [I-D.ietf-core-new-block]
   provides roughly similar features to the Block1/Block2 Options.  It
   provides additional properties that are tailored towards the intended
   DOTS transmission.  Concretely, [I-D.ietf-core-new-block] primarily
   targets applications such as DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) that
   can't use Confirmable (CON) responses to handle potential packet loss
   and that support application-specific mechanisms to assess whether
   the remote peer is able to handle the messages sent by a CoAP
   endpoint (e.g., DOTS heartbeats in Section 4.7 of
   [I-D.ietf-dots-rfc8782-bis]).

   [I-D.ietf-core-new-block] includes guards to prevent a CoAP agent
   from overloading the network by adopting an aggressive sending rate.
   These guards are followed in addition to the existing CoAP congestion
   control as specified in Section 4.7 of [RFC7252].  Table 1 lists the
   CoAP attributes that are used for

                  +---------------------+---------------+
                  | Parameter Name      | Default Value |
                  +=====================+===============|
                  | MAX_PAYLOADS        |            10 |
                  | NON_TIMEOUT         |           2 s |
                  | NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT |           4 s |
                  | NON_PROBING_WAIT    |         247 s |
                  | NON_PARTIAL_TIMEOUT |         247 s |
                  +---------------------+---------------+

                  Table 1: Congestion Control Parameters

   PROBING_RATE and other transmission parameters are negotiated between
   DOTS peers as discussed in Section 4.5.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-dots-rfc8782-bis].  Nevertheless, some of the attributes
   listed in Table 1 are not supported.  This document defines new DOTS
   signal channel attributes that are meant to customize the
   configuration of faster block transmission in a DOTS context.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Readers should be familiar with the terms and concepts defined in
   [RFC7252] and [RFC8612].

   The terms "payload" and "body" are defined in [RFC7959].  The term
   "payload" is thus used for the content of a single CoAP message
   (i.e., a single block being transferred), while the term "body" is
   used for the entire resource representation that is being transferred
   in a block-wise fashion.

   The meaning of the symbols in YANG tree diagrams are defined in
   [RFC8340] and [RFC8791].

   (D)TLS is used for statements that apply to both Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) [RFC8446] and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
   [RFC6347].  Specific terms are used for any statement that applies to
   either protocol alone.

3.  DOTS Attributes for Faster Block Transmission

   Section 6.2 of [I-D.ietf-core-new-block] defines the following
   attributes that are used for congestion control purposes:

   MAX_PAYLOADS:  is the maximum number of payloads that can be
      transmitted at any one time.

   NON_TIMEOUT:  is the maximum period of delay between sending sets of
      MAX_PAYLOADS payloads for the same body.  NON_TIMEOUT has the same
      value as ACK_TIMEOUT (Section 4.8 of [RFC7252]).

   NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT:  is the maximum time to wait for a missing
      payload before requesting retransmission.  NON_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT has
      a value of twice NON_TIMEOUT.

   NON_PROBING_WAIT:  is used to limit the potential wait needed
      calculated when using PROBING_WAIT.  NON_PROBING_WAIT has the same
      value as computed for EXCHANGE_LIFETIME (Section 4.8.2 of
      [RFC7252]).

   NON_PARTIAL_TIMEOUT:  is used for expiring partially received bodies.
      NON_PARTIAL_TIMEOUT has the same value as computed for
      EXCHANGE_LIFETIME (Section 4.8.2 of [RFC7252]).

   These attributes are used together with PROBING_RATE parameter which
   in CoAP indicates the average data rate that must not be exceeded by
   a CoAP endpoint in sending to a peer endpoint that does not respond.
   The single body of blocks will be subjected to PROBING_RATE
   (Section 4.7 of [RFC7252]), not the individual packets.  If the wait
   time between sending bodies that are not being responded to based on

Internet-Draft        DOTS Fast Block Transmission          January 2021


   PROBING_RATE exceeds NON_PROBING_WAIT, then the gap time is limited
   to NON_PROBING_WAIT.

   Except MAX_PAYLOADS, all the aforementioned attributes can be derived
   from attributes that can be negotiated between DOTS peers as per
   Section 4.5.2 of [I-D.ietf-dots-rfc8782-bis].  This document augments
   the "ietf-dots-signal-channel" (dots-signal) DOTS signal YANG module
   defined in [I-D.ietf-dots-rfc8782-bis] with this additional attribute
   that can be negotiated between DOTS peers to enable faster
   transmission:

   max-payloads:  This attribute echoes the MAX_PAYLOADS parameter in
      [I-D.ietf-core-new-block].

      This is an optional attribute.

   For the sake of more flexible configuration, this document defines
   also the following attribute:

   non-timeout:  This attribute echoes the NON_TIMEOUT parameter in
      [I-D.ietf-core-new-block].  The the default value of this
      attribute is 'ack-timeout'.

      This is an optional attribute.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  DOTS Signal Channel CBOR Mappings Registry

   This specification registers the following parameters in the IANA
   "DOTS Signal Channel CBOR Key Values" registry [Key-Map].

   o  Note to the RFC Editor: Please replace TBA1-TBA2 with the CBOR
      keys that are assigned from the 128-255 range.  Please update
      Table 2 accordingly.

5.2.  DOTS Signal Filtering Control YANG Module

   This document requests IANA to register the following URI in the "ns"
   subregistry within the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688]:

     URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-dots-fast-trans
     Registrant Contact: The IESG.
     XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.


   This document requests IANA to register the following YANG module in
   the "YANG Module Names" subregistry [RFC6020] within the "YANG
   Parameters" registry.

     Name: ietf-dots-fast-trans
     Namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-dots-fast-trans
     Maintained by IANA: N
     Prefix: dots-fast
     Reference: RFC XXXX


6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the DOTS signal channel protocol are
   discussed in Section 11 of [I-D.ietf-dots-rfc8782-bis].

   CoAP-specific security considerations are discussed in Section 11 of
   [I-D.ietf-core-new-block].

   This document defines YANG data structures that are meant to be used
   as an abstract representation in DOTS signal channel messages.  As
   such, the "ietf-dots-fast-trans" module does not introduce any new
   vulnerabilities beyond those specified above.
