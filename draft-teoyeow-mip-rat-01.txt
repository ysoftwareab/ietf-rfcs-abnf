Abstract

   This document describes a protocol that provides IP reachability for
   mobile users. Like IP Mobility Support, RFC 2002, each mobile node is
   accessible by its home address, regardless of its current location in
   the Internet. When away from home, the mobile node acquires a care-of
   address indicating its current location. It registers the care-of
   address with a registration server (RS). The RS setups a reverse
   twice network address translation (RAT) table on a RAT device. The
   RAT device transparently routes datagrams destined for the mobile
   node's home address to the care-of address by reverse twice network
   address translation. The protocol requirements for the mobile node is
   minimal. End-users can have mobility support easily as registration
   is done using widely available applications.

1. Introduction

   IP version 4 datagram routing generally depends on the destination
   host's IP address to uniquely identify the host point of attachment
   in the Internet. This implies a host has to be on the network
   indicated by its IP address - the home address in Mobile IP (MIP)
   terminology - to receive packets destined to it.

   This document proposes protocol enhancements to NAT which allow other
   hosts to initiate communication using a mobile node's home address
   when the latter changes location.

   This document does not attempt to describe address translations at a
   RAT device above the network level. RAT only deals with network
   address translation of the IP header. Network Address Port
   Translation (NAPT) and Application Level Gateways (ALGs) can continue
   to operate on top of RAT.

1.1 Reverse Twice Network Address Translators (RAT)

   When a mobile node moves from its home network to a foreign network,
   it acquires a care-of address from the foreign network indicating its
   current location on the Internet. It will then use this topologically
   correct IP address as its source address when sending out packets.
   (When the mobile node is at home, the topologically correct IP
   address will be its home address).

   At the foreign network, the mobile node then registers the new care-
   of address with a registration server (RS) at home. Consequently, the
   RS sets up a reverse twice network address translation entry on the
   RAT device.

   Thus, once registered, the RAT device will transparently route
   datagrams destined for the mobile node's home address to the
   registered care-of address by reverse twice network address
   translation. A more detailed description of reverse twice network
   address translation will be provided at Section 6.

   Reverse twice network address translation is only required when the
   mobile node is not at home and the network sessions are initiated by
   the correspondent nodes, e.g. when the mobile node is an application
   server. For all other situations, the mobile node will communicate
   directly with its correspondent nodes, without the overhead incurred
   by RAT, i.e. the correspondent nodes respond to the mobile node using
   the latter's topologically correct address.

1.2 Goals

Internet Draft       <draft-teoyeow-mip-rat-01.txt>        December 1998


   The main motivation for RAT is to facilitate deployment. Common     
   network technologies are used where possible to reduce implementation
   effort on the mobile node. Until Mobile IP (MIP) is widely supported
   on all operating platforms for mobile users and MIP home agent's
   functions are available on routers, IP mobility support on the
   Internet will be limited.

   Since NAT routers are already widely deployed and implementations
   with twice NAT [REF 3] are available, to provide RAT capability on
   current NAT [REF 4] devices require minimal enhancements. Networks
   with NAT installations will be mobile capable by migrating to RAT. By
   depending on currently available network applications for
   registration, little effort is needed on the user's part to gain the
   benefit of mobility.

   By network address translations, RAT provides transparent mobility to
   end hosts. No enhancements to a mobile node's transport and lower
   network layers are necessary.

   The application protocol employed in the registration process is
   flexible and independent of RAT's base protocol. However, for
   interoperability reasons, the control messages between a registration
   server and a RAT device must be followed.

1.3 Applicability

   The protocol does not attempt to maintain transport and higher-layer
   connections when a node changes location. The main function of RAT is
   to allow correspondent nodes to locate a mobile node by its
   permanently assigned home address.

1.4 Deployment Issues

   In a basic setup, to support RAT, a network needs a registration
   server and a RAT device for each physically partitioned subnet.  The
   mobile node does not require foreign networks to support RAT to have
   mobility support. However, the node must be able to acquire a
   topologically correct IP care-of address via any available external
   mechanism in the foreign location.

1.5 Protocol Requirements

   The mobile node must be able to access at least one of its
   registration servers when in a foreign location.

   The RAT device must be able to deliver datagrams to, and accept
   datagrams from, the mobile node's foreign location.

Internet Draft       <draft-teoyeow-mip-rat-01.txt>        December 1998


   All messages used to inform the registration server of the mobile
   node's current location must be authenticated to protect against
   remote redirection attacks.

1.6 End Host Accessibility

   The correspondent node does not need to know how to reach the RAT
   device.  It sends datagrams to the mobile node's home address, where
   they are intercepted by the RAT device as necessary.

   All correspondent nodes will be able to reach the mobile node if its
   currently assigned IP address is reachable by the RAT device using
   the appropriate routable addresses.

   Correspondent nodes previously accessible by a mobile node at home
   may not be reachable when the mobile node is in a foreign location.
   This is because the correspondent node's access control list or
   network firewall may deny traffic originating from the mobile node's
   current location. This is not a design flaw since the existing
   security policies should not be circumvented for mobility support.

   Another reason why a mobile node cannot reach certain correspondent
   nodes is when the latter are in a network using private IP addresses
   [REF 2] and the mobile node has moved outside the private network, or
   when the mobile node has moved into a private network without NAT
   support. The protocol should not allow a mobile node to reach these
   correspondent nodes unless the security policies permits.

   Private correspondent nodes can still reach a mobile node outside the
   internal network using RAT. The RAT device may deny the forwarding of
   such datagrams for security reasons and send an ICMP Host-Unreachable
   error to the correspondent node.

2. Terminology

   This document adopts the terminology (i.e. Care-of address,
   Correspondent Node, Foreign Network, Home Network) defined in "IP
   Mobility Support" [REF 1] and "IP Network Address Translator
   Terminology and Considerations" [REF 3].

   In addition, three new entities are introduced :

   1. Zero Implementation Mobile Node (0MN)

   Zero Implementation Mobile Node (0MN) identifies a mobile host that
   uses RAT. This is to differentiate the former from the same term used
   in Mobile IP.

Internet Draft       <draft-teoyeow-mip-rat-01.txt>        December 1998


2. Registration Server (RS)

   A registration server is generally located in the mobile node's home
   domain. A 0MN must inform the RS of its new location in a foreign
   network before it can receive datagrams destined for its home
   address. For the registration process to succeed, the RS needs to be
   reachable from the mobile node's current location using the available
   routing mechanisms.

   The registration server will interact with a RAT device to set up the
   reverse translation table. Each entry in the table associates a
   mobile node's home IP address with its care-of address and the
   binding's lifetime.

   The discovery of a registration server is not specified by the
   protocol and is dependent on the application protocol used in the
   registration process. For example, if the registration server uses
   HTTPS for registration, a mobile user may identify the RS by a URL
   address. For the simplest configuration, the RS address can be
   statically configured.

   3. Reverse Network Address Translator (RAT)

   The Reverse Network Address Translator maintains the association
   between the home IP address of each 0MN, its care-of address and the
   binding's lifetime. It uses twice NAT to route datagrams from a 0MN's
   home address to its care-of address.

   The RAT device is generally directly connected to the 0MN's home
   network in order to receive datagrams destined for the latter e.g. by
   proxy ARP. The requirement is unnecessary if the RAT device can
   interoperate with the Mobile IP's home agent entity [REF 1]. The home
   agent can then tunnel datagrams destined for the 0MN to the RAT
   device for final delivery to the 0MN's care-of address.

   It is not necessary for a 0MN to know the identity of the RAT device
   for the protocol to work. For security as well as scalability, it is
   preferred that the RS and the RAT device are on different hosts and
   only the RS should know the RAT devices available on a network.

3. Registration Application Protocol Selection

   The application protocol used by a mobile node to register its
   current care-of address with a registration server is independent of
   the protocol. For security reasons, however, the application protocol
   must fulfill the following criteria :

   1. A mechanism to validate both the mobile node/user identity and its



Teo, Yeow and Singh         Expires June 1999                   [Page 5]





Internet Draft       <draft-teoyeow-mip-rat-01.txt>        December 1998


      current location.

      A registration server must never assume the source IP address of a
      registration request is the care-of address of the mobile node.
      Information disclosure could provide means of hijacking mobile
      node traffic. Therefore it is recommended that the mobile node's
      care-of address be encrypted. Using a user-centred authentication
      scheme, the mobile node's home IP address need not be sent during
      the registration process if the registration server maintains a
      mobile user to home address association.

   2. A mechanism to confirm that the mobile node is still at its
      current registered location.

      The mobile node will need to renew its care-of address by
      re-registration or some similar mechanism, within an appropriate
      lifetime. This is to avoid forwarding datagrams to an old location
      the mobile node has vacated. This renewal request should be
      time-stamped etc to avoid possible replay attacks.

   For easy deployment of RAT as a mobility solution, the application
   protocol used should be widely supported on all operating platforms.
   A good example of an application protocol that meets the above
   security and availability requirements is the Secure Hypertext
   Transfer Protocol (HTTPS), which is HTTP over a Secure Socket Layer
   (SSL).

   A mobile user will only need a World Wide Web (WWW) browser to access
   a WWW server on the registration server. Java applets may be
   downloaded from the registration server to request user
   authentication. With verification of user identity, the applet can
   then transmit time-stamped "keep alive" beacons back to the RS to
   confirm the 0MN location. The messages sent can be encrypted/
   authenticated using a private key the mobile user provided. The
   method of encryption/authentication need not be known to any entity
   except the registration server.

   The specifics of the registration process are beyond the scope of
   this document.

4. Acquiring Care-Of Address

   When a 0MN is in a foreign network and desires mobility support, it
   must acquire a topologically correct IP address in the network.  Any
   available external mechanism supported by the mobile node can be used
   to acquire a care-of address. Popular protocols available are the
   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) or the Point to Point
   Protocol (PPP).

5. Control Messages

   Control messages are used to exchange information between the
   registration server and RAT device. It is not recommended that both
   entities reside on the same machine for the following reasons :

   1. The application protocol used for registration may change with the
      introduction of newer technology but the RAT mechanism will
      remain the same.

   2. Address translation incurs a large overhead in memory and
      computation [refer to Section 9] and dedicated hardware may be
      needed. Administration and installation of myriad feasible
      application protocols on dedicated hardware is not viable.

   3. Failure of the registration server or RAT device will deny
      mobility services. Introducing backup registration servers and
      alternative RAT devices can increase reliability and distribute
      load.

   The control messages are sent with UDP [5] using the well-known port
   number 434 allocated to Mobile IP. New authentication extensions are
   defined to indicate RAT operation. The default authentication
   algorithm uses keyed-MD5 [6] in "prefix+suffix" mode to compute a
   128-bit "message digest" of the control message.

5.1 Reverse Translation Binding (RTB) Request

   A registration server sends a Reverse Translation Binding Request
   (RTBR) to a RAT device to setup the reverse translation table - 0MN's
   home address, care-of address, binding's lifetime.

   The Mobile IP registration request format is used.

   The format is as follows :

   IP fields:

      SA: Typically the interface address from which the registration
          server sends the message.

      DA: Typically that of the RAT device.



   UDP fields:

      Source Port:       variable

      Type     1 (Registration Request)

      B        Broadcast datagrams.  If the 'B' bit is set, the
               registration server requests that the RAT device
               forwards any broadcast datagrams that the 0MN receives on
               the home network.

      D        Decapsulation by RAT device. If the `D` bit is set,
               the RAT device will decapsulate datagrams which are
               tunneled from a Mobile IP's home agent [Refer to Section
               8].

      Lifetime
               The number of seconds remaining before the registration
               is considered expired.  A value of zero indicates a
               request for deregistration.  A value of 0xffff indicates
               infinity.

      Home Address
               The IP address of the 0MN.

      Registration Server
               The IP address of the 0MN's registration server.

      Care-of Address
               The IP address of the 0MN current location.

   Identification
               A 64-bit number, constructed by the registration server
               node, used for matching RTB with RTB Replies, and for
               protecting against replay attacks of RTB messages.

   Extensions
               The fixed portion of the RTB Request is followed by one
               or more of the Extensions. The RAT-Server Authentication
               Extension MUST be included in all RTB Requests.

5.2 Reverse Translation UnBinding (RTU) Request

   When a 0MN is no longer at its registered care-of address, i.e. no
   "keep alive" beacons are sent by the 0MN to the registration server
   or its reverse translation binding's lifetime expires, the
   registration server must send a Reverse Translation UnBinding Request
   to the RAT device to remove the 0MN entry in the reverse translation
   table.

   The format of the RTU request is the same as the RTB request except
   the lifetime field is 0.

5.3 RAT Control Message Reply

   A RAT device returns a Control Reply message to a registration server
   which has sent a RTB or RTU message.

   The Mobile IP registration reply format is used.

   The format of the extension is as follows :

   IP fields:

      SA: Typically copied from the destination address of the RTB or
          RTU Request to which the RAT device is replying.

      DA: Copied from the source address of the RTB or RTU request to
          which the agent is replying

   UDP fields:

      Source Port:           <variable>

      Destination Port:     Copied from the source port of the
                            corresponding RTB or RTU Request

   The UDP header is followed by the RAT fields shown below:

               has been deregistered.  A value of 0xffff indicates
               infinity.  If the Code field indicates that the
               registration was denied, the contents of the Lifetime
               field are unspecified and MUST be ignored on reception.

      Home Address
               The IP address of the 0MN.

      Home Agent
               The IP address of the 0MN's registration server.

      Identification
               A 64-bit number used for matching RTB or RTU Requests
               with RTB or RTU Replies, and for protecting against
               replay attacks of RTB or RTU messages.  The value is
               based on the Identification field from the RTB pr RTU

   Authenticator   (variable length)

   If the extension is missing in a RTB or RTU request and the RAT
   device is also a Mobile IP home agent entity, it must process the
   message as a registration request as specified in Mobile IP.

6. Twice Reverse Network Address Translation

   On successful registration with a registration server, a 0MN is
   associated with the tuple <home address IP, care-of address IP>. For
   any session initiated by a correspondent node, all requests and
   reponse must be routed via the same RAT device.

   Any datagram with a destination address that is a registered 0MN's
   home address in the reverse translation table must be reverse address
   translated. Any reply from the registered 0MN to the RAT device must
   be similarly translated.

   The following example illustrates the operation of a RAT device at
   the network level. Network Address Port Translations and Application
   Layer Gateways' operations (if any) are not illustrated.

   Correspondent Node Address:   137.0.0.10

7. ICMP Error Translation

   When a RAT device receives an ICMP Destination-Unreachable error
   message for datagrams destined to a care-of address in the reverse
   address translation table, the error message should be translated as
   follows :

   IP fields:

      SA: RAT device's outgoing interface address to correspond node
      DA: correspondent node address that initiated the session

   ICMP field:

      Type: 3

   If the ICMP code indicates network unreachable, it should be replaced
   by the corresponding host unreachable number. The IP header embedded
   within the ICMP payload must be similarly modified.

8. Comparisons

   8.1 NAT and RAT comparison

   Network Address Translation (NAT) is typically used when a network's
   internal IP addresses cannot be used externally. NAT can connect
   separate routing realms with different addressing schemes. It does
   that by translating the network address of datagrams to the
   appropriate routable address in the corresponding routing space.
   Therefore NAT is used when the end hosts are in different routing
   realms. The NAT device must be assigned an address in each of the
   routing realms it connects.

   The purpose of Reverse Network Address Translation (RAT) is
   different. RAT is used even when the end hosts are in the same
   routing space to forward datagrams destined to the mobile node's home
   address to the latter's care-of address. The RAT device only needs to
   be assigned one address if all end hosts are in the same routing
   space.

   Reverse Network Address Translation (RAT) does twice Network Address
   Translation [REF 3] for datagram delivery. In twice NAT, both the
   source and destination addresses are translated. The current reason
   for twice NAT is to connect end hosts that use overlapping address
   space in their home network. A unique intermediate address space is
   used to connect the end hosts i.e. the RAT device becomes the virtual
   sender/receiver of the mobile/correspondent nodes.

   NAT is always needed for communicating hosts in separate routing
   realms regardless of the session direction [REF 3]. RAT is needed

Internet Draft       <draft-teoyeow-mip-rat-01.txt>        December 1998


   only when the session is intiated by the correspondent nodes. In
   traditional NAT [REF 4], translation is initiated by the client nodes
   which the NAT device services. RAT translation is reverse initiated
   by the correspondent nodes and by not the mobile client nodes which
   the RAT device services.

   8.2 Mobile IP and RAT comparison

   The Network Address Translator (NAT) and NAPT have become popular
   because of easy deployment. They require no modifications to the
   communicating hosts. Mobile IP however faces difficulties in
   deployment as all mobile nodes need to support the protocol. While
   implementation and deployment of Mobile IP home agents need not be
   concerned with the operating system, mobile users are constrained to
   operating systems which supports Mobile IP. Network adminstration for
   Mobile IP's security authentication and key allocation also requires
   additional configuration tools for the novice user.

   The base protocol of Mobile IP does not support communication across
   different routing realms e.g. between private and public nodes. If
   such mobility support is desired, Mobile IP extension for Private
   Internets Support [8] or Firewall Support for Mobile IP [9] is
   needed. NAT's main function is to allow communication between
   different routing realms. If the current NAT installation already
   support such communication for sessions initiated in any routing
   realm, RAT can provide the mobility support without additional
   enhancements.

   Mobile IP uses IP tunneling to deliver datagrams to a mobile node's
   care-of address. This allows a mobile node to bypass traditional
   firewalls that only filter packets based on the IP tunnel header.
   RAT uses twice NAT/NAPT to deliver datagrams to a mobile node's
   care-of address. Certain applications which embed the end hosts' IP
   addresses in the data payload will not function with NAT/NAPT if
   there are no application layer gateways available to support them.

   Mobile IP specifies the registration message formats and semantics
   for mobile nodes. RAT uses common application protocols supported on
   any network operating systems. The delivery mechanism - twice
   NAT/NAPT - is explicitly separated from the registration mechanism in
   RAT.

   RAT provides limited mobility in comparison to Mobile IP. It does not
   attempt to maintain connection orientated sessions while the mobile
   node moves across multiple networks.

   Where the abovementioned limited mobility and application support is
   sufficient, RAT is much easier as a deployment solution.

Internet Draft       <draft-teoyeow-mip-rat-01.txt>        December 1998


   In Mobile IP, there are 2 main purposes for a mobile node to have a
   fixed IP address - the home IP address :

   1. To enable all correspondent nodes to identify the mobile node with
      a fixed IP address that is unchanged regardless of location.

   2. To retain connection orientated transport protocols, e.g. TCP
      connections, while the mobile node moves across networks.

   The intended function of RAT is to achieve the first purpose. It is
   typically unnecessary for the mobile node in a foreign location to
   use its home IP address as the source IP address when originating a
   datagram.

   Such an approach as defined in MobileIP has two disadvantages :

   1. Datagrams originating from the correspondent node will generally
      need to be routed to the mobile node's home network before they
      are tunnelled to the mobile node care-of address.

   2. If Ingress filtering is deployed at the mobile node's current
      foreign location to filter datagrams with topologically incorrect
      source IP address, bidirectional tunneling is required to bypass
      the Ingress filter.

   Both of the above situations may result in a longer routing path
   between the sender and receiver.

   In RAT, for a correspondent node initiated session, the end hosts'
   routing path is similiar to bidirectional tunneling in Mobile IP.
   This will form a dog-legged route, from the mobile node to RAT device
   to correspondent node and vice versa.

   For communication initiated by the mobile node, since both the end
   hosts' addresses used are topologically correct, standard IP routing
   is sufficient and RAT will not be involved. However, communication
   will fail in situations where the home IP address is necessary e.g.
   where IP datagrams originating from the care-of address of a 0MN are
   blocked by a firewall, but not those originating from its home
   address.

Interoperation with Mobile IP

   The basic RAT protocol is meant to provide a fast and simple mobility
   solution. Its main advantage is any node can be mobile if desired as
   no RAT-specific protocol support is needed for a 0MN.  To push
   forward the deployment of a Mobile IP infrastruture, we have designed
   RAT so that it can be incrementally enhanced to support a gradual

   installation of Mobile IP entities. This is possible mainly because
   RAT adopts the same format and semantics of Mobile IP registration
   messages.  In the following, we describe how mobility support can
   migrate from RAT to Mobile IP.

   To begin supporting Mobile IP, we need to deploy home agents instead
   of RAT devices at every network segment. Since the home agents'
   operating platform and hardware do not affect the mobile user, any
   available feasible implementation can be selected. The result is
   that, instead of one RAT device for every network segment, a home
   agent can intercept the 0MNs' traffic on behalf of the RAT device.
   Thereafter, the RAT device is no longer bound to one home network
   segment.

   1. Migration Step 1

   To interoperate with home agents, the RAT device will need to add
   support for IP tunnel decapsulation. After accepting a registration
   request from a 0MN, the registration server will now additionally
   send a Mobile IP registration request to the home agent on behalf of
   the 0MN, with the RAT device specified as the tunnel endpoint. Mobile
   traffic delivery is now tunneled from the home agent to the RAT
   device and the RAT device will do address translation to deliver the
   traffic to the 0MN.

   2. Migration Step 2

   The next transition phase is to support IP decapsulation at the
   mobile node.  The movement detection and registration process remain
   unchanged, but mobile traffic delivery will no longer require a RAT
   device. The registration server will send Mobile IP registration
   requests to the home agents as above but now the tunnel endpoint is
   not the RAT device but a mobile node. In this model, seamless
   mobility is now achievable.

   3. Migration Step 3

   The final evolution to complete Mobile IP compatibility will require
   the mobile node to support movement detection and perform
   registration as specified in Mobile IP. In this last stage, the
   registration server is no longer required; however the benefits of a
   central entity for managing mobility policies may argue for retaining
   the registration server. In such a configuration, the registration
   server acts as a trusted registration proxy between the mobile node
   and its home agent. Mobile nodes need only know its registration
   server address. All home address to home agent address associations
   are maintained at the registration server, allowing transparent
   handover to alternative home agents in the event of a home agent

   failure or migration.

   For more details on RAT to Mobile IP migration, see [REF 10].

10. Scalability Issues

   The overhead of maintaining address tables and performing address
   translations is computationally intensive. Each data packet is
   subjected to RAT lookup and modifications. This implies the RAT
   device is a possible bottleneck and point of failure. If there are
   alternative RAT devices, recovery of the reverse translation table
   during a RAT device failure is possible with the information stored
   in the registration server.

11. RAT Limitations

   For any sessions that requires RAT when a mobile node is not at home,
   applications or security mechanisms that fail with NAT/NAPT with no
   available specific application layer gateway (ALG), will similarly
   fail with RAT.

   RAT is subjected to additional limitations listed in [REF 1] when
   address translations are necessary.

12. Current Implementation

   A prototype implementation of RAT based on NAPT is now under
   development at http://cram.comp.nus.edu.sg:8080/cram/rat/. It
   supports TCP, UDP and ICMP. Application-level gateways are required
   for most protocols layered on top of these, including FTP, RTSP and
   HTTP.

   To differentiate CN-to-0MN from 0MN-to-CN datagrams, the source and
   destination IP addresses, port numbers and transport protocol of each
   IP datagram received at the RAT device are examined. Then, the
   datagrams are translated as in the following diagram before being
   retransmitted by the RAT device:

13. Security Considerations

   The security considerations described in [REF 1] for all variations
   of NATs are applicable to RAT when address translations are
   necessary.

   A security log must be maintained at the registration server. Each
   registration request <home IP address, care-of address, time> should
   be recorded.

   If simultaneous valid registration requests with different care-of
   addresses from the same mobile node is received, the event MUST be
   logged. The registration server must discard all future registration
   requests from the same mobile node. A registration failure message
   should be sent to the requested care-of address if the application
   protocol supports error handling. The format of the message will be
   dependent on the application protocol used.

   All registration failures MUST be logged. The mobile user should be
   informed the time of the most recent successful/failed registration
   for each new registration attempt if possible.
