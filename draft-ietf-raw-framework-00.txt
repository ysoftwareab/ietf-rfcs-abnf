               Reliable and Available Wireless Framework
                      draft-ietf-raw-framework-00

Abstract

   Reliable and Available Wireless (RAW) provides for high reliability
   and availability for IP connectivity over a wireless medium.  The
   wireless medium presents significant challenges to achieve
   deterministic properties such as low packet error rate, bounded
   consecutive losses, and bounded latency.  This document defines the
   RAW Architecture following an OODA loop that involves OAM, PCE, PSE
   and PAREO functions.  It builds on the DetNet Architecture and
   discusses specific challenges and technology considerations needed to
   deliver DetNet service utilizing scheduled wireless segments and
   other media, e.g., frequency/time-sharing physical media resources
   with stochastic traffic.

1.  Introduction

   Wireless networks operate on a shared medium where uncontrolled
   interference, including the self-induced multipath fading, cause
   random transmission losses and add new dimensions to the statistical
   effects that affect reachability and packet delivery.

   To defeat those additional causes of transmission delay and loss,
   Reliable and Available Wireless (RAW) leverages deterministic layer-2
   capabilities with diversity in the spatial, time, code, technology,
   and frequency domains.  The challenge is to provide enough diversity
   and redundancy to ensure the timely packet delivery while preserving
   energy and optimizing the use of the shared spectrum.

Internet-Draft         RAW Architecture/Framework          November 2021


   The "RAW Architecture" [RAW-ARCHI] document presents the RAW problem
   and architectural concepts such as path and Tracks to provide IPv6
   [IPv6] flows with Service Level Objectives (SLO) in terms of packet
   delivery ratio (PDR), maximum contiguous losses or lantency
   boundaries over wireless access and meshes.

   RAW distinguishes the longer time scale at which routes are computed
   from the the shorter forwarding time scale where per-packet decisions
   are made.  RAW operates within the Network Plane at the forwarding
   time scale on one DetNet flow over a complex path called a Track.
   The Track is preestablished and installed by means outside of the
   scope of RAW; it may be strict or loose depending on whether each or
   just a subset of the hops are observed and controlled by RAW.

   The RAW Architecture is structured as an OODA Loop (Observe, Orient,
   Decide, Act).  It involves:

   1.  Network Plane measurement protocols for Operations,
       Administration and Maintenance (OAM) to Observe some or all hops
       along a Track as well as the end-to-end packet delivery

   2.  Controller plane elements to reports the links statistics to a
       Path computation Element (PCE) in a centralized controller that
       computes and installs the Tracks and provides meta data to Orient
       the routing decision

   3.  A Runtime distributed Path Selection Engine (PSE) that Decides
       which subTrack to use for the next packet(s) that are routed
       along the Track

   4.  Packet (hybrid) ARQ, Replication, Elimination and Ordering
       Dataplane actions that operate at the DetNet Service Layer to
       increase the reliability of the end-to-end transmission.  The RAW
       architecture also covers in-situ signalling when the decision is
       Acted by a node that down the Track from the PSE.

   The RAW Framework combines IETF specification to enable RAW Service
   Level Agreements (SLA) over a selected technologies [RAW-TECHNOS].
   The framework implements the OODA loop to optimizes the use of
   redundancy while minimizing the use of constrained resources such as
   spectrum and battery.

2.  Use Cases and Requirements Served

   In order to focus on real-worlds issues and assert the feasibility of
   the proposed capabilities, RAW focuses on selected technologies that
   can be scheduled at the lower layers: IEEE Std. 802.15.4 timeslotted
   channel hopping (TSCH), 3GPP 5G ultra-reliable low latency
   communications (URLLC), IEEE 802.11ax/be where 802.11be is extreme
   high throughput (EHT), and L-band Digital Aeronautical Communications
   System (LDACS).  See [RAW-TECHNOS] for more.

   "Deterministic Networking Use Cases" [RFC8578] presents a number of
   wireless use cases including Wireless, such as application to
   Industrial Applications, Pro-Audio, and SmartGrid Automation.
   [RAW-USE-CASES] adds a number of use cases that demonstrate the need
   for RAW capabilities for new applications such as Pro-Gaming and
   drones.  The use cases can be abstracted in two families, Loose
   Protection, e.g., protecting the first hop in Radio Access Protection
   and Strict Protection, e.g., providing End-to-End Protection in a
   wireless mesh.

2.1.  Radio Access Protection

   To maintain the required SLA at all times, a wireless Host may use
   more than one Radio Access Network (RAN) in parallel.

                                      ...   ..
                    RAN 1  -----  ...     ..  ...
                 /              .      ..         ....
   +--------+  /              .                    ....    +-----------+
   |Wireless|-                .                     .....  |  Service  |
   | Device |-***-- RAN 2 -- .       Internet       ....---|     /     |
   |(STA/UE)|-                ..                   .....   |Application|
   +--------+  $$$             .               .......     +-----------+
                 \               ...   ...     .....
                    RAN n  --------  ...   .....

   *** = flapping at this time  $$$ expensive

                     Figure 1: Radio Access Protection

   The RANs may be heterogeneous, e.g., 3GPP 5G [RAW-5G] and Wi-Fi
   [RAW-TECHNOS] for high-speed communication, in which case a Layer-3
   abstraction becomes useful to select which of the RANs are used at a
   particular point of time, and the amount of traffic that is
   distributed over each RAN.

   The idea is that the rest of the path to the destination(s) is
   protected separately (e.g., uses non-congruent paths, leverages
   DetNet / TSN, etc...) and is a lot more reliable, e.g., wired.  In
   that case, RAW observes the reliability of the end-to-end operation
   through each of the RANs but only observes and controls the wireless
   operation the first hop.

   A variation of that use case has a pair of wireless Hosts connected
   over a wired core / backbone network.  In that case, RAW observes and
   controls the Ingress and Egress RANs, while neglecting the hops in
   the core.  The resulting loose Track may be instantiated, e.g., using
   tunneling or loose source routing between the RANs.

2.2.  End-to-End Protection in a Wireless Mesh

   In radio technologies that support mesh networking (e.g., Wi-Fi and
   TSCH), a Track is a complex path with distributed PAREO capabilities.
   In that case, RAW operates through the multipath and makes decisions
   either at the Ingress or at every hop (more in Section 5).

                           A-------B-------C-----D
                          /  \   /       /        \
                   Ingress ----M-------N--zzzzz--- Egress
                          \      \   /            /
                           P--zzz--Q-------------R

                  zzz = flapping now

                      Figure 2: End-to-End Protection

   The Protection may be imposed by the source based on end-to-end OAM,
   or performed hop-by-hop, in which case the OAM must enables the
   intermediate Nodes to estimate the quality of the rest of the
   feasible paths in the remainder of the Track to the destination.

3.  Related Work at The IETF

   RAW intersects with protocols or practices in development at the IETF
   as follows:

   *  The Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) [RFC8175] from [MANET]
      can be leveraged at each hop to derive generic radio metrics
      (e.g., based on LQI, RSSI, queueing delays and ETX) on individual
      hops.

   *  [detnet] provides an OAM framework with [DetNet-OAM] that applies
      within the DetNet dataplane described in [DetNet-DP],which is
      typically based on MPLS or IPv6 pseudowires.

Internet-Draft         RAW Architecture/Framework          November 2021


   *  [BFD] detect faults in the path between an Ingress and an Egress
      forwarding engines, but is unaware of the complexity of a path
      with replication, and expects bidirectionality.  BFD asynchronous
      mode considers delivery as success whereas with DetNet and RAW,
      the bounded latency can be as important as the delivery itself,
      and delivering too late is actually a failure.  Note that the BFD
      Demand mode with unsolicited notifications may be more suitable
      then the Asynchronous BFD mode.  The use of the Demand mode in
      MPLS is analyzed in [I-D.mirsky-bfd-mpls-demand] and similar
      considerations could apply to IP as well.

   *  [SPRING] and [BIER] define in-band signaling that influences the
      routing when decided at the head-end on the path.  There's already
      one RAW-related draft at BIER [BIER-PREF] more may follow.  RAW
      will need new in-band signaling when the decision is distributed,
      e.g., required chances of reliable delivery to destination within
      latency.  This signaling enables relays to tune retries and
      replication to meet the required SLA.

   *  [CCAMP] defines protocol-independent metrics and parameters
      (measurement attributes) for describing links and paths that are
      required for routing and signaling in technology-specific
      networks.  RAW would be a source of requirements for CCAMP to
      define metrics that are significant to the focus radios.

   *  [IPPM] develops and maintains standard metrics that can be applied
      to the quality, performance, and reliability of Internet data
      delivery services and applications running over transport layer
      protocols (e.g.  TCP, UDP) over IP.

4.  Scope and Prerequisites

   A prerequisite to the RAW operation is that an end-to-end routing
   function computes a complex sub-topology along which forwarding can
   happen between a source and one or more destinations.  The concept of
   Track is specified in the 6TiSCH Architecture [6TiSCH-ARCHI] to
   represent that complex sub-topology.  Tracks provide a high degree of
   redundancy and diversity and enable the DetNet PREOF, network coding,
   and possibly RAW specific techniques such as PAREO, leveraging
   frequency diversity, time diversity, and possibly other forms of
   diversity as well.

   How the routing operation (e.g., PCE) in the Controller Plane
   computes the Track is out of scope for RAW.  The scope of the RAW
   operation is one Track, and the goal of the RAW operation is to
   optimize the use of the Track at the forwarding timescale to maintain
   the expected SLA while optimizing the usage of constrained resources
   such as energy and spectrum.

Internet-Draft         RAW Architecture/Framework          November 2021


   Another prerequisite is that an IP link can be established over the
   radio with some guarantees in terms of service reliability, e.g., it
   can be relied upon to transmit a packet within a bounded latency and
   provides a guaranteed BER/PDR outside rare but existing transient
   outage windows that can last from split seconds to minutes.  The
   radio layer can be programmed with abstract parameters, and can
   return an abstract view of the state of the Link to help the Network
   Layer forwarding decision (think DLEP from MANET).

   How the radio interface manages its lower layers is out of control
   and out of scope for RAW.  In the same fashion, the non-RAW portion
   along a loose Track is by definition out of control and out of scope
   for RAW.  Whether it is a single hop or a mesh is also unknown and
   out of scope.

5.  Wireless Tracks

   The "6TiSCH Architecture" [6TiSCH-ARCHI] introduces the concept of
   Track.  RAW extends the concept to any wireless mesh technology,
   including, e.g., Wi-Fi.  A simple Track is composed of a direct
   sequence of reserved hops to ensure the transmission of a single
   packet from a source Node to a destination Node across a multihop
   path.

   A Complex Track provides multiple N-ECMP forwarding solutions.  The
   Complex Track enables to support multi-path redundant forwarding by
   employing PRE functions [RFC8655] and the ingress and within the
   Track.  For example, a Complex Track may branch off and rejoin over
   non-congruent segments.

   In the context of RAW, some links or segments in the Track may be
   reversible, meaning that they can be used in either direction.  In
   that case, an indication in the packet signals the direction of the
   reversible links or segments that the packet traverses and thus
   places a constraint that prevents loops from occurring.  An
   individual packet follows a destination-oriented directed acyclic
   graph (DODAG) towards a destination Node inside the Complex Track.

6.  Flow Identification vs. Path Identification

   Section 4.7 of the DetNet Architecture [RFC8655] ties the app-flow
   identification which is an application-layer concept with the network
   path identification that depends on the networking technology by
   "exporting of flow identification", e.g., to a MPLS label.

   With RAW, this exporting operation is injective but not bijective.
   e.g., a flow is fully placed within one RAW Track, but not all
   packets along that Track are necessarily part of the same flow.  For



Thubert & Berger           Expires 2 June 2022                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft         RAW Architecture/Framework          November 2021


   instance, out-of-band OAM packets must circulate in the exact same
   fashion as the flows that they observe.  It results that the flow
   identification that maps to an application layer flowat the network
   layer must be separate from the path identification that is used to
   forward a packet.

   Section 3.4 of the DetNet data-plane framework [DetNet-DP] indicates
   that for a DetNet IP Data Plane, a flow is identified by an IPv6
   6-tuple.  With RAW, that 6-tuple is not what indicates the Track, in
   other words, the flow ID is not the Track ID.

   For instance, the 6TiSCH Architecture [6TiSCH-ARCHI] uses a
   combination of the address of the Egress End System and an instance
   identifier in a Hop-by-hop option to indicate a Track.  This way, if
   a packet "escapes" the Track, it will reach the Track Egress point
   through normal routing and be treated at the service layer through,
   say, elimination and reordering.

   The RAW service includes forwarding over a subset of the Links that
   form the Track (a subTrack).  Packets from the same or a different
   flow that are routed through the same Track will not necessarily
   traverse the same Links.  The PSE selects a subTrack for a packet
   based on the links that are preferred and those that should be
   avoided at this time.

   Each packet is forwarded within the subTrack that provides the best
   adequation with the SLA of the flow and the energy and bandwidth
   constraints of the network.

                          Figure 3: Flow Injection

   With 6TiSCH, packets are tagged with the same (destination address,
   instance ID) will experience the same RAW service regardless of the
   IPv6 6-tuple that indicates the flow.  The forwarding does not depend
   on whether the packets transport application flows or OAM.  In the
   generic case, the Track or the subTrack can be signaled in the packet
   through other means, e.g., encoded in the suffix of the destination
   address as a Segment Routing Service Instruction [SR-ARCHI], or

7.  Source-Routed vs. Distributed Forwarding Decision

   Within a large routed topology, the route-over mesh operation builds
   a particular complex Track with one source and one or more
   destinations; within the Track, packets may follow different paths
   and may be subject to RAW forwarding operations that include
   replication, elimination, retries, overhearing and reordering.

   The RAW forwarding decisions include the selection of points of
   replication and elimination, how many retries can take place, and a
   limit of validity for the packet beyond which the packet should be
   destroyed rather than forwarded uselessly further down the Track.

   The decision to apply the RAW techniques must be done quickly, and
   depends on a very recent and precise knowledge of the forwarding
   conditions within the complex Track.  There is a need for an
   observation method to provide the RAW Data Plane with the specific
   knowledge of the state of the Track for the type of flow of interest
   (e.g., for a QoS level of interest).  To observe the whole Track in
   quasi real time, RAW considers existing tools such as L2-triggers,
   DLEP, BFD and leverages in-band and out-of-band OAM to capture and
   report that information to the PSE.

   One possible way of making the RAW forwarding decisions within a
   Track is to position a unique PSE at the Ingress and express its
   decision in-band in the packet, which requires the explicit signaling
   of the subTrack within the Track.  In that case, the RAW forwarding
   operation along the Track is encoded by the source, e.g., by
   indicating the subTrack in the Segment Routing (SRv6) Service
   Instruction, or by leveraging BIER-TE such as done with [BIER-PREF].

   The alternate way is to operate the PSE in each forwarding Node,
   which makes the RAW forwarding decisions for a packet on its own,
   based on its knowledge of the expectation (timeliness and
   reliability) for that packet and a recent observation of the rest of
   the way across the possible paths based on OAM.  Information about
   the desired service should be placed in the packet and matched with
   the forwarding Node's capabilities and policies.

   In either case, a per-track/subTrack state is installed in all the
   intermediate Nodes to recognize the packets that are following a
   Track and determine the forwarding operation to be applied.

8.  Encapsulation and Decapsulation

   In the generic case where the Track Ingress Node is not the source of
   the Packet, the Ingress Node needs to encapsulate IP-in-IP to ensure
   that the Destination IP Address is that of the Egress Node and that
   the necessary Headers (Routing Header, Segment Routing Header and/or
   Hop-By-Hop Header) can be added to the packet to signal the Track or
   the subTrack, conforming [IPv6] that discourages the insertion of a
   Header on the fly.

   In the specific case where the Ingress Node is the source of the
   packet, the encapsulation can be avoided, provided that the source
   adds the necessary headers and that the destination is set to the
   Egress Node.  Forwarding to a final destination beyond the Egress
   Node is possible, e.g., with a Segment Routing Header that signals
   the rest of the way.  In that case a Hop-by-Hop Header is not
   recommmended since its validity is within the Track only.


9.  Operations Administration and Maintenance

9.1.  DetNet OAM

   [detnet] provides an OAM framework with [DetNet-OAM] that applies
   within the DetNet dataplane described in [DetNet-DP],which is
   typically based on MPLS or IPv6 pseudowires.  How the framework
   applies to IPv6 is detailed in [DetNet-IP-OAM].  Within that
   framework, OAM messages follow the same forward path as the data
   packets and gather information about their individual treatment at
   each hop.  When the destination receives an OAM message, it gets a
   view on the full path or at least of a segment of the path from the
   source of the flow.

   In-situ OAM (IOAM) adds telemetry information about the experience of
   one packet within the packet itself [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data], with
   the caveats that the measurement and the consecutive update of the
   packet interfere with the operation being observed, e.g., may
   increase the latency of the packet for which it is measured and into
   which it is stamped.

   Note: IOAM and analogous on-path telemetry methods are capable of
   facilitating collection of useful telemetry information that
   characterizes the state of a system as experienced by the packet.
   But because of statistical character of a packet network, these
   methods may not be used to monitor the continuity of a path (Track)
   or proper connectivity of the Track (no leaking packets across
   Tracks).

Internet-Draft         RAW Architecture/Framework          November 2021


   This effect can be alleviated by measuring on the fly but reporting
   later, e.g., by exporting the data as a separate management packet
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-direct-export].
   [I-D.mirsky-ippm-hybrid-two-step] proposes an hybrid two-steps method
   (HTS) where a trigger message starts the measurement and a follow up
   along the Track packet gathers the measured data.

   "Error Performance Measurement" [I-D.mirsky-ippm-epm] uses Fault
   Management (FM) and Performance Management (PM) OAM mechanisms to
   determine availability/unavailability of a path according to
   predefined SLA.

9.2.  RAW Extensions

   Classical OAM typically measures information at the transmitter,
   e.g., residence time in the node or transmit queue size.  With RAW,
   there is a need to combine information at the sender (number of
   retries) with that at the receiver (LQI, RSSI).  This doubles the
   operating cost of an IAOM processing that would gather the experience
   of a single packet.

   The RAW PSE may be centralized at the Track Ingress, or distributed
   long the Track.  Either way, the PSE needs instant information about
   the rest of the way to the destination over the possible next-hop
   adjacencies along the Track in order to decide how to perform simple
   forwarding, load balancing, and/or replication, as well as
   determining how much latency credit is available for ARQ.

   To provide that information timely, it makes sense that the OAM
   packets that gather instantaneous values from the radio senders and
   receivers at each hop flow on the reverse path and inform the PSE at
   the source and/or the PAREO relays about the state of the rest of the
   way.  This is achieved using Reverse OAM packets that flow along the
   Reversed Track, West to East.

   Because the quality of transmission over a wireless medium varies
   continuously, it is important that RAW OAM captures the state of the
   medium across an adjacency over multiple transmission and over a
   recent period of time, whether the transmitted packets belong to this
   flow or another.  Some of the measured information relates to the
   medium itself.  In other words, the captured information does not
   only relate to the experience of one packet as is the case for IOAM,
   but also to the medium itself.  This makes an approach like HTS more
   suitable as it can trigger the capture of multiple measurements over
   a short period of time.  On the other hand, the PSE needs a
   continuous measurement stream where a single trigger is followed by a
   periodic follow up capture.

   In other words, the best suited OAM method to enable the PSE make
   accurate PAREO forwarding decisions is a periodic variation of the
   two-steps method flowing along the reverse Track, as an upstream OAM
   technique.  [RAW-OAM] provides more information on the RAW OAM
   problem and solution approaches.

9.3.  Observed Metrics

   The Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) [RFC8175] from [MANET] can
   be leveraged at each hop to derive generic radio metrics (e.g., based
   on LQI, RSSI, queueing delays and ETX) on individual hops.

   Those lower-layer metrics are aggregated along a multihop segment
   into abstract layer 3 information that reflect the instant
   reliability and latency of the observed path.

10.  Security Considerations

   RAW uses all forms of diversity including radio technology and
   physical path to increase the reliability and availability in the
   face of unpredictable conditions.  While this is not done
   specifically to defeat an attacker, the amount of diversity used in
   RAW makes an attack harder to achieve.

10.1.  Forced Access

   RAW will typically select the cheapest collection of links that
   matches the requested SLA, for instance, leverage free WI-Fi vs. paid
   3GPP access.  By defeating the cheap connectivity (e.g., PHY-layer
   interference) the attacker can force an End System to use the paid
   access and increase the cost of the transmission for the user.

11.  IANA Considerations
