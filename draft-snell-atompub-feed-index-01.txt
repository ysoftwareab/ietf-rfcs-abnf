Internet-Draft                 Feed Index                    August 2005


1.  Introduction

   In syndication document formats such as Atom [I-D.ietf-atompub-
   format] and RSS ([http://purl.org/rss/1.0/spec][http://
   blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss]), the order of entries as presented
   in the list is typically insignificant.  This presents a challenge
   when the list of entries is intended to represent an ordered list of
   elements.

   This document specifies a mechanism that allows feed publishers to
   specify a numeric index within a feed that may be used to order
   entries.  Although it refers to Atom normatively, the mechanism
   described herein can be used with similar syndication formats, such
   as the various flavors of RSS.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119], as
   scoped to those conformance targets.

   In this specification, "entry" refers to an atom:entry element or
   similar construct from other syndication formats (e.g., RSS) that are
   contained within a feed.

   In this specification, "feed" refers to an Atom Feed Document or
   similar syndication format (e.g., RSS) that contains a collection of
   entries.

   In this specification, "head section" refers to the children of a
   feed document's document-wide metadata container; e.g., the child
   elements of the atom:feed element in an Atom Feed Document.

   In this specification, "index" refers a nonNegativeInteger as defined
   by section 3.3.20 of [W3C.REC-xmlschema-2-20041028].

   This specification uses XML Namespaces [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114]
   to uniquely identify XML element names.  It uses the following
   namespace prefix for the indicated namespace URI;
   "i": "http://purl.org/syndication/index/1.0"

   This specification uses terms from the XML Infoset [W3C.REC-xml-
   infoset-20040204].  However, this specification uses a shorthand; the
   phrase "Information Item" is omitted when naming Element Information
   Items.  Therefore, when this specification uses the term "element,"
   it is referring to an Element Information Item in Infoset terms.

3.  The 'i:indexed' Element

   The i:indexed element MAY occur no more than once in a feed's head
   section and indicates that the entries within the feed will have an
   associated index that may be used to sort the entries.  The element's
   value MUST be empty.

   For example,
     <i:indexed />

   The i:indexed element MAY have a sort attribute whose value indicates
   the default sort order for indexed entries.  The attribute's value
   MUST be either "desc" indicating a descending sort order or "asc"
   indicating an ascending sort order.  If the sort attribute is
   omitted, a value of "asc" is assumed.  The value of the sort
   attribute is case insensitive.

   For example,
     <i:indexed sort="desc" />

   The i:indexed element MUST NOT contain any other attributes.

   A feed that does not contain an i:indexed element MUST NOT contain
   any i:index elements.

4.  The 'i:index' Element

   The i:index element conveys a nonNegativeInteger as specified by
   [W3C.REC-xmlschema-2-20041028] used to order entries within a feed.
   If the feed's head section contains an i:indexed element, every entry
   within that feed MUST have a i:index element.  The value of each
   i:index element MUST NOT be used more than once within a feed,
   ensuring that no two elements ever share the same index value.  The
   index values are not required to be contiguous.  The value of the
   i:index element MUST NOT contain any leading or trailing whitespace.

   The i:indexed element MUST NOT contain any attributes.

   For example,
     <i:index>1</i:index>

5.  Presenting Ordering Entries

   When presented with a feed whose head section contains an i:indexed
   element, a consumer MAY present the entries ordered in either an
   ascending or descending order based on the value of the i:index
   element and the value of the i:indexed element's sort attribute if
   present (ascending order if not).

Internet-Draft                 Feed Index                    August 2005


   For example,

     <feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
           xmlns:i="http://purl.org/syndication/index/1.0">
       ...
       <i:indexed />

       <entry>
         <id>tag:entry:1</id>
         <i:index>3</i:index>
         ...
       </entry>

       <entry>
         <id>tag:entry:2</id>
         <i:index>2</i:index>
         ...
       </entry>

       <entry>
         <id>tag:entry:3</id>
         <i:index>1</i:index>
         ...
       </entry>
     </feed>

   When presented, the entries from the example feed would be sorted in
   ascending order by i:index value, or:

     1. tag:entry:3
     2. tag:entry:2
     3. tag:entry:1

   While entries within a feed containing an i:indexed element are
   required to have i:index elements, a consumer MAY still wish to
   display indexed feeds whose entries do not contain indexes.  In this
   case, entries within an indexed feed that do not contain i:index
   elements MUST be displayed at the end of the list regardless of sort
   order.

Internet-Draft                 Feed Index                    August 2005


   For example,

     <feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
           xmlns:i="http://purl.org/syndication/index/1.0">
       ...
       <i:indexed />

       <entry>
         <id>tag:entry:1</id>
         <i:index>3</i:index>
         ...
       </entry>

       <entry>
         <id>tag:entry:2</id>
         <i:index>2</i:index>
         ...
       </entry>

       <entry>
         <id>tag:entry:3</id>
         <i:index>1</i:index>
         ...
       </entry>

       <entry>
         <id>tag:entry:4</id>
         ...
       </entry>
     </feed>


     1. tag:entry:3
     2. tag:entry:2
     3. tag:entry:1
     4. tag:entry:4

   Consumers are not required to present entries in the order
   established by the i:indexed and i:index elements.

6.  Validation

   It is a validation error if a feed contains an i:indexed element but
   one or more of it's entries do not contain an i:index element.

   It is a validation error if two i:index elements within a single feed
   specify the same nonNegativeInteger value.

Internet-Draft                 Feed Index                    August 2005


   It is a validation warning if a one or more feed entries contains an
   i:index element but the feed head section does not contain an
   i:indexed element.

   It is a validation error if the i:indexed element contains any
   attributes other than sort.

   It is a validation error if the i:indexed element's sort attribute,
   if present, specifies any value other than "asc" and "desc".  The
   value is case insensitive. e.g. "asc", "Asc", "ASC", "aSc", etc are
   all valid variations of "asc".

   It is a validation error if the i:indexed element's value is not
   empty.

   It is a validation error if the i:index element contains any
   attributes.

   It is a validation error if the i:index element's value is anything
   other than a nonNegativeInteger as specified by [W3C.REC-xmlschema-2-
   20041028].

7.  Security Considerations

   It is possible for malicious intermediaries to alter the indexes
   specified for entries within a feed or to alter the default sort
   order as specified by the i:indexed element.  This risk can be
   mitigated by digitally signing the indexed feed such the i:indexed
   and i:index elements are covered by the signatures.
