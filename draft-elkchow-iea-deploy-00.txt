             Deployment Issues for Internationalized Email
                      draft-elkchow-iea-deploy-00


Abstract

International Email Addresses (IEA) are far from the global reality. The
current de-facto language of the Internet is English.  Even today, many
of the users of the Internet do not speak English as their primary
language.  The next billion users of the Internet are likely to be even
less familiar with English. IEA is probably the first application needed
in a truly internationalized Internet.   The Email Address
Internationalization (EAI) Working Group defined the RFCs to support
internationalized email.  The time may now finally have come to develop
best practices and to discuss the deployment challenges for IEA.

INTERNET DRAFT       draft-elkchow-idniea-deploy-00      October 4, 2016


1  Introduction

   The Email Address Internationalization (EAI) Working Group, which has
   concluded, created a structure and framework for internationalized
   email addresses.  From the charter:

   "The email address has two parts, local part and domain part. Email
   address internationalization must deal with both. This working
   group's previous experimental efforts investigated the use of UTF-8
   as a general approach to email internationalization. That approach is
   based on the use of an SMTP extension to enable the use of UTF-8 in
   envelope address local-parts, optionally in address domain-parts, and
   in mail headers. The mail header contexts can include both addresses
   and wherever existing protocols (e.g., RFC 2231) permit the use of
   encoded-words." [EAICharter]

   Much work was done in this group including:

   RFC 6530 : Overview and Framework for Internationalized Email 
             [RFC6530]
   RFC 6531 : SMTP Extension for Internationalized Email [RFC6531]
   RFC 6532 : Internationalized Email Headers [RFC6532]
   RFC 6533 : Internationalized Delivery Status and Disposition 
              Notifications [RFC6533]
   RFC 6783 : Mailing Lists and Non-ASCII Addresses [RFC6783]
   RFC 6855 : IMAP Support for UTF-8 [RFC6855]
   RFC 6856 : Post Office Protocol Version 3 (POP3) Support for UTF-8 
             [RFC6856]
   RFC 6857 : Post-Delivery Message Downgrading for Internationalized 
              Email Messages [RFC6857]
   RFC 6858 : Simplified POP and IMAP Downgrading for Internationalized
              Email [RFC6858]

   Yet, deployment lags.  Global EAI is far from the reality.

   The Internet is getting bigger day by day by integrating top level
   domains using non-ASCII based scripts i.e Devanagari,Cyrillic,Arabic,
   Chinese etc. These new top level domains need to be able to send
   emails as well as to access web sites via browsers.

   If a user has an internationalized email address, then it should be
   possible to send/ receive to/from any email address using any email
   client. This interoperability demands concerted efforts by all major
   email service providers. Even now, there is very limited or no
   support in email servers (SMTP, IMAP, POP), email providers (Gmail,
   Yahoo, Hotmail) and email clients.

   Often, it is not even possible to create an email ID for end-users in

INTERNET DRAFT       draft-elkchow-idniea-deploy-00      October 4, 2016


   a non-ascii based language while many Internationalized Domain Names
   (IDN) exist.  This is of major concern to many in the parts of the
   world where the primary language is not English.


1.1  Punycode

   Languages not based on the Latin script (A, B, C, etc) use unicode to
   represent the letters in their alphabet rather than ASCII. Punycode
   is used to show unicode characters in ASCII format.  It is used in
   the transport of email.

   For example:

   English: Nehru
   Hindi: ????? [Cannot be displayed]
   Punycode: xn--l2bq0a0bw

   Punycode will start with the prefix: "xn--".

   An application handling IDN domains has to reference an IDN
   repository to know how to display them. Emails add to the
   complication since many email systems pre-date the introduction of
   IDNs. These systems often simply reject emails that don't work within
   the old domain name model.

1.2  Single Language / Multiple Languages

   Some people ask, "What if I send an email in Russian and want to
   respond in Chinese?"   What problems will arise?

   This is certainly an important issue but it is hard enough to send
   emails back and forth in one non-ASCII based language. This draft
   will leave for the future the issues of multiple languages with the
   accompanying translation and user interface issues.


2   Email Servers

   For an email server to be ready for EAI, it must implement:

   RFC 6530 : Overview and Framework for Internationalized Email 
              [RFC6530]
   RFC 6531 : SMTP Extension for Internationalized Email [RFC6531]
   RFC 6532 : Internationalized Email Headers [RFC6532]

   Here is a partial list of servers and test beds for EAI:

INTERNET DRAFT       draft-elkchow-idniea-deploy-00      October 4, 2016


   PostFix 3.0 and above
   Coremail
   Throughway (Thailand)
   OpenMail (Taiwan)
   EAI test environment (Saudi Arabia) 
   Xgenplus (INDIA)

2.1 Backend Databases

   The email servers store data in relational databases such as MySQL
   and MariaDB.   These databases must support UTF-8 and be configured
   to use UTF-8.   There may need to be both Punycode and UTF-8 fields
   defined on occasion.

3  Email Clients

   Since the email client is the interface to the user, here is where a
   number of issues arise.  There are a number of email clients services
   providers that support EAI to various extents.  A partial list
   follows:

   Coremail
   Horde Project
   Microsoft Outlook 2016 for PC
   Gmail - to some extent
   Apple Mail - to some extent
   Throughway (Thailand)
   OpenMail (Taiwan)
   EAI test environment (Saudi Arabia) 
   Roundcube

3.1  Display of Email ID

   The email ID is often shown in Punycode.   For example, the email id:
   harish@nalini.bharat in Hindi is:

   ???????@??????.?????? [cannot be displayed]

   This email ID will be displayed in many email clients in Punycode. 
   That is, the email ID will be shown as: xn--t2bmh3a@xn--l2ba3a4cg.xn-
   -h2brj9c.  This is not particularly user-friendly.


3.2  Display of Email Body

   The issue with the email body have to do with an easy ability to type
   in the language of choice.   A number of browsers have extensions to
   allow this.

INTERNET DRAFT       draft-elkchow-idniea-deploy-00      October 4, 2016


   But when it comes to displays of links containing IDN names, often
   the link does not work.

3.3  Messages Routed to SPAM

   Messages may be routed by email clients to SPAM if they are not in
   English.

4  Multiple Identities / Aliases

   A user may have multiple identities.  That is, he / she may have an
   English language email ID, a Hindi email ID, and so on.

5  Email Address Books

   Email address books today have little or no support for addresses in
   non-Latin based languages.

6  Security Considerations

6.1  Homographic Attacks

   A user on Internet can be easily duped with Russian letters 'a, e, p,
   or y' as they are indistinguishable in writing from their English
   equivalents. A number of the letters (such as "a") are closely look
   alike etymologically, whereas others look similar by sheer
   coincidence. for example, Russian letter p is really pronounced like
   r, however the glyphs of both the letters are identical. Russian
   isn't the single such language; other Cyrillic languages could cause
   similar collisions.

   For example paypal.com and paypal.com are look alike however first
   domain name contains the Russian letter "a" while other contains
   English letter "a",further it can lead to similar-looking e-mail IDs
   such as Nalini@paypal.com,and Nalini@paypal.com ;both are similar in
   view however different e-mail IDs in reality.In this case,the
   characters used for the fraud are perfectly legitimate.

   Therefore numerous English domain and e-mail IDs may be homographed -
   that is, maliciously misspelled by substitution of non-Latin letters.
    A number of approaches may be utilized to protect against this sort
   of attack. the best fix would indiscriminately forbid domain names
   that combine letters from totally different alphabets, but this will
   block actually helpful names like "CNNenEspanol.com". [Note: the 'n'
   in Espanol has a ~ on the top]   Alternatively, the browser may
   highlight international letters existing in domain names with a
   separate color, although users might find this system excessively
   intrusive.

INTERNET DRAFT       draft-elkchow-idniea-deploy-00      October 4, 2016


   Browsers may solely highlight really suspicious names, like ones that
   blend letters from different scripts inside one single word. For
   additional security, the browser may use a map of identical letters
   to look for collisions between the requested domain and equally
   written registered ones. If critical, it would then warn the user of
   suspected fraud

6.2  Use of Mixed Scripts

   Legitimate uses for mixed scripts in both Japanese and Chinese are
   also possible, and many people use Latin usernames with IDN domains.

6.3  Right-to-left Issues

   Some languages, for example, Arabic, are written right-to-left.
   Systems created to work with Arabic script typically switch when the
   first Arabic character is entered. But with a mixed script email
   address such as 'customer.care@[IDN domain].IDN', the system needs to
   be able to handle both left-to-right and right-to-left scripting.

   This could be an additional potential security issue.  If someone
   registers the domain name "customer.helpline" in this scenario, they
   could type in the Arabic script first (username), triggering an email
   system to switch to right-to-left and then put in the domain
   "customer.helpline". It would appear in the input box as though
   "customer.helpline" was the username on the left-hand side of the
   email address. The only difference would be that the whole address
   would be aligned right.

7 IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations.
