1. Introduction 

      In traditional transport networks, circuits are provisioned on 
   multiple switches. Service Providers (SP) need to verify that the 
   circuits are provisioned correctly in both control and data plane for 
   management purpose. MPLS-TP bidirectional LSPs emulating traditional 
   transport circuits need to provide the same connection verification 
   capability.  

   In this document, an MPLS-TP LSP means either MPLS transport LSP or 
   MPLS Pseudowire (PW) [2].  

   The proposed solution is based on new type of MPLS-OAM message called 
   Connection Verification (CV) message. 

   An MPLS-OAM CV message originates at a Maintenance End Point (MEP) 
   but can be directed to by any Maintenance Intermediate Point (MIP) 
   along the path of MPLS-TP LSP as well as the other MEP. Therefore, 
   the proposed mechanism addresses the verification of the full or 
   partial path of an MPLS-TP LSP.

   An MPLS-OAM CV message is intercepted at any MIP based on MPLS TTL 
   expiry, and at MEP simply because it is the end of the LSP (i.e., 
   regardless the value of the TTL). 

   In response to the MPLS-OAM CV request, each LSR along the path of 
   the MPLS-TP LSP appends its ID using a newly defined TLV called 
   Record Route TLV. 

   A Record Route TLV appended by a given LSR contains: 

     . The LSR address. 

     . Local Labels allocated by the LSR for both directions of the 
        MPLS-TP LSP. 

   To describe the connection verification functionality, let us assume 
   an MPLS-TP LSP between LSR-1 and LSR-5 passing through LSR-2, LSR-3, 
   and LSR-4. Thus, LSR-1 and LSR-5 are MEPs whereas LSR-2, LSR-3, and 
   LSR-4 are MIPs. The objective is to verify (both in control and data 
   planes) the MPLS-TP LSP from LSR-1 to LSR-5 (end-to-end), and record 
   all the IDs of the LSRs along the path. This could be accomplished 
   using a conventional traceroute operation in which LSR-1 interrogates 
   each LSR-2 through LSR-5 (using appropriate TTL value) in turn using 
   a new message and response, and compiles the result. This approach 
   requires 8 messages; a request and a response between LSR-1 and each 
   of the other LSRs. On the other hand, the mechanism that we describe 
   below can accomplish the goal with only 5 messages. The same 
   mechanism can work if the MPLS-TP LSP is a Multisegment PseudoWire 
   (MS-PW) [8]. 

   It is possible that the path of an MPLS-TP LSP contains loop(s) due 
   to misconfiguration. Such mistakes are possible with manual 
   configuration. For example, assume that MPLS-TP LSP under discussion 
   is misconfigured such LSR-4 connects to LSR-2 instead of LSR-5. This 
   results in a loop. In this case, the MPLS-OAM CV packets self limit 
   when the MTU is reached, and when it happens, it is good practice to 
   silently drop those packets. 

  If a MIP does not understand the MPLS-OAM CV message, it must 
  silently drop the packet. To trap this condition as well as to trap 
  the looping condition, an ingress MEP that initiates connection 
  verification starts a timer when it sends an MPLS-OAM CV message. If 
  the timer expires before it has received a response, the MEP assumes 
  one of the following conditions: 

     . the MPLS-TP LSP is incomplete. 

 
 
Boutros                  Expires June 9, 2009                  [Page 3] 
                                                     
Internet-Draft     draft-boutros-mpls-tp-cv-00.txt         January 2009 
    

     . an LSR (either MIP or MEP) does not understand the MPLS-OAM CV 
        message. 

     . there is a loop. 

   The ingress MEP then examines the MPLS-TP LSP by using the classic 
   one-hop at a time, direct response traceroute. 

  In case not all hops on the path of the MPLS-TP LSP are MIPs, an 
  ingress MEP can send conventional trace route with incrementing TTL 
  1, 2, 3, ...., to all MIPs and to the egress MEP along the path. Some 
  of those requests will be sent to non MIP/MEP LSRs and will be 
  dropped silently. When the MIPs and egress MEP receive the request, 
  they will respond with an MPLS-OAM CV response message. The TTL value 
  of the response SHOULD be large to ensure the response message 
  reaches the ingress MEP without being intercepted at any MIP.  
  Optionally, the TTL value of the response MAY be set to 1 so that 
  each MIP can verify its ID included in the response message as the 
  response travels towards the ingress MEP. 

  An MPLS-OAM CV message contains the following information: 

     1. Connection ID for the MPLS-TP in question. 

     2. IDs of the LSR (to record the route). 

     3. Sequence Number to correlate a given reply with the correct 
        request. 

  The above information is carried in TLV format. 

   The proposed mechanism is based on a set of new TLVs which can be 
   transported using one of the following methods:  
    

     1. Using in-band MPLS-OAM messages which are forwarded as MPLS     
        packets (Non-IP-Based).  

     2. Using in-band LSP-Ping extensions defined in [3] where IP/UDP 
        packets are used (IP-Based). The LSP-Ping messages are sent 
        using the  codepoint defined in [4].  
         

   Conventions used in this document

3. MPLS-TP Connection Verification Mechanism 

   For the Non-IP-Based option, the proposed mechanism uses a new code 
   point in the Associated Channel Header (ACH) described in [7]. 

   The IP-Based option will be in compliance to specifications [3] and 
   [4]. 

   Also, the proposed mechanism requires a set of new TLVs called 
   Connection Verification Request TLV, Connection Verification Reply 
   TLV, Record Route TLV. Also, Response TLVs defined in [5], and the

   Address Block and Connection-ID TLVs defined in [6] are also required 
   for this mechanism. 

   The new TLVs are described below. 

4. MPLS-OAM Connection Verification Message 

   In the Non-IP-Based option, under MPLS label stack of the MPLS-TP 
   LSP, the ACH with "MPLS-TP Connection Verification" code point 
   indicates that the message is an MPLS OAM Connection Verification 
   message. In addition, a 32-bit field is added to carry the message ID 
   and the message length as shown below:  

   0                   1                   2                   3

   Connection Verification Request TLV is used to instruct a MEP or a 
   MIP to record the route by appending the Record Route TLV (described 
   below) to the MPLS-OAM message and forward the packet along the path 
   of the MPLS-TP LSP (in the case of a MIP) or send a response back to 
   the sender MEP (in the case of the receiver MEP). 

   The request will contain LSR-Address and connection-ID sub-TLVs 
   defined in [6]. 

   In case of errors, the receiver MEP or MIP MUST send a NAK response 
   to the sender MEP using an MPLS-OAM message with a Response TLV 
   containing the error code described below.

   The Record Route TLV includes the LSR address sub-TLV defined in [6] 
   as well as the forward and reverse local labels (allocated by the LSR 
   for both directions of the LSP). The forward local label is the label 
   allocated by the LSR in the direction of the connection verification 
   request message. The reverse local label at a MEP MUST be 0.

     16    LSP is not setup in control or data planes 

     17    LSR ID not in the MPLS-OAM CV response message 

   Note that the proposed connection verification mechanism also 
   requires the some other return codes specified in [5]. 

4.5. Network Management System 

   An operator should be able to provision any given LSR to send MPLS-
   OAM CV Request packets from a MEP and notify NMS when MPLS-OAM CV 
   Response arrives. 

5. Operation 

   Consider an MPLS-TP LSP LSR-1 <--> LSR-2 <--> LSR-3 <--> LSR-4 <--> 
   LSR-5. LSR-1 and LSR-5 are ingress and egress LSR for the respective 
   direction. LSR-1 and LSR-5 are MEPs, and LSR-2 through LSR-4 are 
   MIPs. 

   The proposed mechanism operates as follows: 

  1. After the MPLS-TP LSP is configured at LSR-1 and LSR-5 with the 
     same connection-ID, LSR-1 sends an MPLS-OAM CV Request message 
     along the path of the LSP. 

  2. The MPLS-OAM CV Request message is intercepted at LSR-2 (MIP) 
     because of TTL expiry. LSR-2 then verifies the request and:  

       1. if the message is malformed, it sends a response with the 
          error code 2 back to LSR-1.

Internet-Draft     draft-boutros-mpls-tp-cv-00.txt         January 2009 
    

       2. if any of the TLV is not known, it sends a response with error 
          code 3 back to LSR-1. It may also include the unknown TLVs. 

       3. if message authentication fails, it sends a response with the 
          error code 4 back to LSR-1. 

       4. if connection-ID cannot be matched, it sends a response with 
          error code 14. 

       5. if the MPLS-TP LSP is not setup in control or data planes, it 
          sends a response with error code 16. 

         Note that MPLS TTL value is set to 255 in the response message. 

  3. LSR-2 then verifies the request and if connection-ID matches that 
     in the message, and if the MPLS-TP LSP is setup in control and data 
     planes, it appends its address as well as the local labels to the 
     message and forward it to LSR-3 with a TTL = 1.  

  4. LSR-3 repeats the steps (2) or (3). In the absence of error, the 
     messages progresses towards LSR-5 with each LSR adding its own ID 
     and the local labels. 

  5. Upon getting the MPLS-OAM CV message, LSR-5 verifies the request, 
     and if an MPLS-TP LSP whose connection-ID matches that in the 
     message is found, and if that MPLS-TP LSP is setup in both control 
     and data planes, LSR-5 sends a response back to the LSR-1. The 
     response contains the record route received by LSR-5. The TTL value 
     of the response will be such that the response message reaches LSR-
     1 without further interception at any other LSR. As an optional 
     alternative, LSR-5 may send the packet down the return path with a 
     TTL=1 so that an LSR can verify its ID included in the response. 

  6. When LSR-1 receives a response with a large TTL (i.e., TTL value is 
     not equal to 1), it becomes aware of the IDs of each LSR on the 
     path as well as how far away (in terms of hop-count) is each LSR 
     from itself. Hence, LSR-1 may send an MPLS-OAM message directly to 
     any LSR using an appropriate TTL value in the future. On the other 
     hand, if LSR-1 receives a response with TTL value equals 1, it gets 
     a confirmation that the path is bidirectionally symmetric, which is 
     a critical consideration in transport networks.
