 Update to Include Route Object (IRO) specification in Path Computation
                 Element communication Protocol (PCEP)
                      draft-ietf-pce-iro-update-04

Abstract

   During discussions of a document to provide a standard representation
   and encoding of Domain-Sequence within the Path Computation Element
   (PCE) communication Protocol (PCEP) for communications between a Path
   Computation Client (PCC) and a PCE, or between two PCEs, it was
   determined that there was a need for clarification with respect to
   the ordered nature of the Include Route Object (IRO).

   An informal survey was conducted to determine the state of current
   and planned implementation with respect to IRO ordering and handling
   of Loose bit (L bit).

   This document updates the IRO specification of RFC 5440 based on the
   survey conclusion and recommendation.

1.  Introduction

   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
   computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.

Internet-Draft                 IRO-UPDATE                  December 2015


   [RFC5440] defines the Include Route Object (IRO) to specify network
   elements to be traversed in the computed path.  The specification did
   not mention if IRO is an ordered or un-ordered list of sub-objects.
   It mentioned that the Loose bit (L bit) has no meaning within an IRO.

   [RFC5441] suggested the use of IRO to indicate the sequence of
   domains to be traversed during inter-domain path computation.

   In order to discover the current state of affairs amongst
   implementations a survey of the existing and planned implementations
   was conducted.  This survey [I-D.dhody-pce-iro-survey] was informal
   and conducted via email.  Responses were collected and anonymized by
   the PCE working group chair.

   During discussion of [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-domain-sequence] it was
   proposed to have a new IRO type with ordered nature, as well as
   handling of Loose bit (L bit); however, with the update to [RFC5440]
   described in this document, no new IRO type is needed.

   This document updates the IRO specifications in section 7.12 of
   [RFC5440] as per the conclusion and action points presented in
   [I-D.dhody-pce-iro-survey].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Update in IRO specification

   Section 7.12 of [RFC5440] describes IRO as an optional object used to
   specify a set of network elements to be traversed in the computed
   path.  It also states that the Loose bit (L bit) in sub-object has no
   meaning within an IRO.  It did not mention if IRO is an ordered or
   un-ordered list of sub-objects.

   A survey of the existing and planned implementations was conducted in
   order to discover the current state of affairs amongst
   implementations.  [I-D.dhody-pce-iro-survey] describe the
   questionnaire, results and presents some conclusions and proposed
   action items.

   The survey suggest that most implementations construct or interpret
   IRO in an ordered fashion and consider it to be an ordered list.
   More than half of implementation under survey consider the IRO sub-
   objects as strict hops, others consider loose or support both.  The
   results shown in this survey seems to suggest that most

Internet-Draft                 IRO-UPDATE                  December 2015


   implementations would be fine with updating [RFC5440] to specify IRO
   as an ordered list as well as to enable support for Loose bit (L bit)
   such that both strict and loose hops could be supported in the IRO.

2.1.  Update to RFC 5440

   Section 7.12 of [RFC5440] regarding the IRO specification is updated
   to remove the last line in the section 7.12 of [RFC5440], that states

      - "The L bit of such sub-object has no meaning within an IRO."

   Further, the Section 7.12 of [RFC5440] is updated to add following
   two statements -

   - The content of IRO is an ordered list of sub-objects representing a
   series of abstract nodes.  An abstract node could just be a simple
   abstract node comprising one node or a group of nodes for example an
   AS (comprising of multiple hops within the AS) (refer section 4.3.2
   of [RFC3209]).

   - The L Bit of IRO sub-object is set based on the loose or strict
   property of the sub-object, which is set if the sub-object represents
   a loose hop.  If the bit is not set, the sub-object represents a
   strict hop.  The interpretation of Loose bit (L bit) is as per
   section 4.3.3.1 of [RFC3209].

3.  Other Considerations

   Based on the survey, it should be noted that most implementation
   already support the update in the IRO specification as per this
   document.  The other implementation are expected to make an update to
   the IRO procedures.

4.  Security Considerations

   This update in IRO specification does not introduce any new security
   considerations, apart from those mentioned in [RFC5440].
   Clarification in the supported IRO ordering or Loose bit handling
   will not have any negative security impact.

   It is worth noting that PCEP operates over TCP.  An analysis of the
   security issues for routing protocols that use TCP (including PCEP)
   is provided in [RFC6952], while [I-D.ietf-pce-pceps] discusses an
   experimental approach to provide secure transport for PCEP.
