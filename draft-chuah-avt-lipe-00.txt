Abstract

   Several application level compression/multiplexing solutions have
   been proposed in the IETF Audio/Video Transport (AVT) Working Group
   [1][2][9] to improve the transport efficiency of packet-voice traffic
   over IP-based networks. These approaches generally assume voice
   packets are RTP/UDP/IP encapsulated by the communicating end-points
   (e.g., IP phones, mobile terminal, media gateways, etc.).  In some
   transport scenarios, using RTP/UDP/IP encapsulation for voice packet
   is unnecessary as only the data transfer service provided by the IP
   layer is required, not the media control functions.

   This document describes a lightweight IP encapsulation scheme to
   multiplex low bit rate audio (or multimedia) packets into a single
   UDP/IP session or IP session. The decision to multiplexing audio

   packets at the UDP or IP layer is left as a balance between data
   transport efficiency and implementation complexity among the
   communicating end-points across a routed IP network.

1.  Introduction

   As the Internet evolves into a ubiquitous communication infrastruc-
   ture, IP based technologies have also become more sophisticated.  As
   a consequence of the maturing of the IP technology, it is now evident
   that the previously separate data and voice networks are converging
   to provide integrated service, including data, voice and video.
   While data packets can often be quite large, voice packets are in
   general rather small. Codecs at the IP telephony gateway which,
   compress the incoming speech samples, generate packets with sizes
   ranging from 5 to 20 bytes per speech sample. For example, G723.1
   generates a 20 bytes speech packet at 30 ms intervals [3]. Many
   codecs used in cellular environments generate packets of size less
   than 10 bytes per speech sample.

   Such small size packets are subjected to a large transport overhead
   if transfered in individual IP packets. For example a 10-byte voice
   packet transmitted using UDP/IP encapsulation incurs an overhead of
   28 bytes (20 byte IP header, plus possibly 8 bytes UDP header), or
   280%.  In addition, if each audio stream uses one UDP media session,
   the large number of packets will create heavy packet processing load
   for the intermediate media gateway devices that operate above the
   IP-layer, even if no processing of the user flow is required.  The
   available UDP port numbers may also become a limiting factor on the
   maximum number of sessions.

   Although the relatively high transport overhead may not constitute a
   critical traffic engineering factor in transport scenarios where net-
   work bandwidth is plentifull, the situation is quite different for
   many wireless access networks where T1/E1 links are used to
   carry packets from many voice users.  There, the concept of pooling
   multiple user flows into a more efficienty multiplexed channel is
   highly appealing.

   Fortunately, for many applications, it is possible to multiplex a
   large number of sessions into a single IP packet to improve effi-
   ciency and scalability without incurring much multiplexing delay.
   For example, when long distance telephony is offered over the Inter-
   net, the IP telephony gateways or the mobile switching centers in a
   cellular network provide an interface between the existing circuit
   switched telephone networks (such as PSTN and cellular networks like
   CDMA/GSM/TDMA network) and the packet switched IP data networks. The
   voice calls between a pair of IP telephony gateways or the mobile
   switching centers can be multiplexed into a single UDP session.  As
   another example, in a CDMA based cellular network, an IP network may
   be used as the access network by the wireless service provider to
   connect the base stations to the mobile switching centers, part of
   whose function is to select the reverse direction radio frames and

   duplicate the forward direction radio frames for mobiles in soft
   handoff. In this case, the radio frames from different mobiles han-
   dled by the same base station, which can be either voice or data, can
   also be multiplexed into a single UDP session.

   Many such applications have specific delay requirements. In the first
   example above, the usual transfer delay and delay jitter requirements
   for voice application applies.  In the second example, the duplicate
   radio frames in the reverse direction must be received by the mobile
   switching center within a small time window for the frame selection.

   RTP [4] is a protocol designed to provide various real time services
   to the application layer with no assumption on the underlying network
   providing timely delivery or quality-of-service commitments. It can
   be used when the network is not heavily loaded and the application it
   supports can adapt to the varying network conditions to some extent.
   To improve the transport efficiency, some multiplexing schemes have
   been proposed within the framework of RTP [1,2].

   Many of the features of RTP are designed to provide media control
   information to cope with the unavailability of QoS guarantees from
   the underlying network at the application layer. As such guarantees
   become available in modern/future IP networks, some of these features
   become unnecessary. These features are also of limited value to non-
   RTP applications (e.g., most commercial wireless voice traffic). In
   this document, we propose to use a lightweight encapsulation scheme
   based on UDP/IP for multiplexing application sessions. LIPE is
   designed to support multimedia traffic including both voice and data.
   We also include some discussions on how UDP/IP header compression can
   be done to provide even more savings.


2.  The Encapsulation Scheme

   The Lightweight IP Encapsulation (LIPE) uses either UDP/IP or IP as
   the transport layer. Each LIPE encapsulated payload consists of a
   variable number of multimedia data packet (MDP).  For each MDP, there
   is a multiplexing header (MH) that conveys protocol and media
   specific information.

   The format of an IP packet conveying multiple MDPs over UDP using a
   minimum size MH is shown in Figure 1 (a).

   either type of encapsulation format.

2.1.  Basic
   The Multiplexing Header (MH) comprises of two components:  the Header
   Extension bit (the E bit) and the MDP length field. Optional Exten-
   sion Headers can be supported via the E bit. The MH format is shown
   in Figure 3.

                   Figure 3: Multiplexing Header Format

   E bit (E bit): The Header Extension bit is the least significant bit
   of the MH header. It is set to one/zero to indicate the
   presence/absense of an extension header. If the E-bit is set to one,
   the first header extension MUST be a UserID header.  Length: 7 bit
   length field. This field indicates the size of the entire MDP packet
   in bytes, including the E bit, Length field and optional extended
   headers (if they exist).



2.2.  Extension

   Extension headers are used to convey user specific information. It
   also facilitates the customization of LIPE to provide additional con-
   trol information e.g. sequence number, voice/video quality estimator.


2.2.1.  User

   The 16-bit User Identifier is the first field in any Extension
   Header.  It is used to identify MDPs belonging to specific user
   flows.  The format of a LIPE encapsulated payload with a UserID
   extension header is shown in Figure 4. The least significant bit of
   the 1st byte of UserID is the X-bit.  When set to one, it indicates
   that the extension header is longer than 2 bytes.  Thus, effectively
   addressing range of the UserID field is 15-bit long.

                   Figure 4 :  A MH with a UserID field

   The 15-bit UserID allows up to 32768 flows to be multiplexed into a
   single UDP/IP session. The seemingly high number for the UserID is
   chosen for various reasons. First, many applications may be alive,
   but not active, for quite some time. These "dormant" applications
   will still hold on to the user identifiers. Therefore, the number of
   active applications that can actually contribute to the multiplexed
   channel may be much smaller.  Second, in a mobile environment, when a
   mobile is handed off from one base station to another, the applica-
   tion on this mobile will have to be multiplexed into another UDP ses-
   sion in the new base station. Assuming each mobile takes up one iden-
   tifier, if the UserID space is large enough, it is possible to make
   the UserID unique to the frame handler in the mobile switching center
   (or Radio Network Controller). Consequently during soft handoff
   between base stations controlled by the same frame handler (as shown
   in Figure 4), there is no need to reassign UserID thus saving signal-
   ing cost.

   base station identifier field (e.g. 5 bits). Such subdivision is
   vendor-specific and can be done transparently (as long as the two
   peers understand the formats).


2.2.2.  Payload

   If the X-bit in the UserId field is set, it means there is a Paylaod
   Identifier (PID) extension header following the UserID field.  The
   Payload Identifier field starts with a 4-bit Payload Type Identifier
   (PTI) , a 4-bit PID Length and any additional payload specific data.
   The format of the PID field is illustarted in Figure 6.

   the E bit set to zero indicating that there is no extended header.
   The UserID is not used since the context ID [8] within the compressed
   RTP/UDP/IP header can uniquely identify the user.

   Figure 8(b) :  Carrying IS95 voice packets

   In the example, PID Type =1 indicates that this is IS95 voice packets
   and the additional extended header is 3 bytes long. The additional
   information carried in the extended header is the IS95 packet type
   (PTI), some timing information, voice quality indictor, and sequence
   numbers.

       Figure 8(c):  Carrying UMTS conversational/streaming packets

   In this scenario, the E bit is set to one and the X bit is set to
   zero. The UserID is used to identify the different user flows. The
   payload is the frame protocol (FP) PDU described in [TS25.413].

   Note that in our encapsulation scheme, no field is provided in the
   header for error checking. Instead we rely on the IP or UDP checksum
   to provide for the overall IP or UDP payload error detection. We
   believe this level of protection is sufficient since the IP packet
   carrying multiplexed audio (or multimedia) frames are not carried
   over the air.


3.  QoS

   Besides the traditional best-effort service, other services such as
   integrated service (including controlled load service and guaranteed
   service) and differentiated service have been defined. These ser-
   vices, by reserving certain network resources such as bandwidth, can
   provide the traffic with certain guarantees such as delay and loss.

   To support multiple QoS classes, we suggest using the DSCP bits of
   the IP header e.g. for high quality voice, we can mark the IP packet
   with multiplexed audio frames with EF code point; for low quality
   voice, we can mark it with one of the appropriate AF code points.


4.  Multiplexing Policy

   Given the link MTU L_max, a UDP/IP packet can carry payload of up to
   L_max - H_ip - H_udp, where H_ip is the IP header length (20 bytes

   without option) and H_udp is the UDP header length (8 bytes). To
   limit the multiplexing delay, a multiplexing timer with a lifetime of
   T_mux is used. H_mh is the multiplexing header length. The encapsula-
   tion policy is as follows:

   a) If the total size of the received radio frames plus that of that
   of their H_mh exceeds L_max - H_ip - H_udp, send all the MDP frames
   except the most recently received one (no fragmentation of MDP) in
   one UDP packet, and restart the multiplexing timer. The newly
   received MDP is held for multiplexing with upcoming MDPs.

   b) If the multiplexing timer expires, send the accumulated MDPs in
   one UDP packet and restart the encapsulation timer.


5.  UDP/IP Header Compression

   Note that if IP headers are not required to do routing (say the
   underlying network is either ATM or MPLS), one can either remove or
   compress the UDP/IP (IP) header. That will increase further the
   bandwidth efficiency of using the LIPE scheme in a radio access net-
   work where the BSs have IP interfaces that run over ATM/MPLS net-
   works.

   When we map a certain UDP, or (IP+TID), tunnel into a particular
   MPLS/ATM connection, we need to ensure that the quality of service
   provided by the MPLS/ATM connection matches with the DSCP indicated
   in the IP header.



6.  Comparison of the LIPE scheme with other existing proposals

   In this section, we compare 3 approaches for carrying multiplexed
   audio packets in terms of the overhead incurred. The 3 approaches
   considered are cUDP/PPPMux, tCRTP, and LIPE. We assume that PPP/HDLC
   is the Layer 2 technology used.

   Approach 1  cUDP/PPPMux PPP/HDLC    4 bytes PPP ID      1 byte
    per stream PFF,length   1 byte
               cUDP/IP      3 byte
               payload

   Approach 2  tCRTP PPP/HDLC    4 bytes cIP          3 byte L2TP HC
   1 byte PPPMuxID     1 byte PPPID        1 byte
    per stream PFF,length   1 byte
               cUDP/IP      3 byte
               payload

INTERNET DRAFLightweight Internet Protocol Encapsulation Scheme  June 2000


   Approach 3 LIPE PPP/HDLC    4 bytes cUDP/IP     3 byte
      per stream length 1 byte
                 UID  0-2 bytes
                 payload

   We see that for approach 3, the per stream overhead is 1-3 bytes
   while for approaches 1 & 2, the per stream overhead is 4 bytes.


7.  PPP

   A new LCP Configuration Option is used to request LIPE operation for
   the PPP link.  A summary of the LIPE  Configuration Option format for
   the Link Control Protocol (LCP) is shown below.  The fields are
   transmit- ted from left to right.

       0                   1
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     Type      |    Length     |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      Type

         TBD

      Length

         3

   The new LCP option is used only as a hint to the peer that LIPE
   operation is preferred by the sender.  Support of LIPE operations  is
   negotiated in each direction independently. Acknowledgement of the
   LIPE LCP Option (TBD) does not obligate a peer to transmit LIPE
   frames.  Non LIPE-speakers SHOULD instead send LCP Configure- Reject
   for the option.

   If either LCP Configure-Nak or LCP Configure-Reject is received for
   this option, then the next transmitted LCP Configure-Request MUST NOT
   include this option. If the received LCP Configure-Request message
   does not contain a  LIPE LCP option, an implementation MUST NOT send
   an unsolicited Configure-Nak for the option.

   (An implementation of LIPE that is already in LIPE framing mode and
   receives this option in an LCP Configure-Request message MAY, both
   for clarity and for convergence reasons, elect to send LCP
   Configure-Ack.  It MUST NOT restart LCP nor change framing modes in
   this case.)

   The size of a LIPE encapsulated frame MUST NOT exceed the maximum
   receive unit (MRU) size negotiated during LCP [10].


8.  Negotiating usage of LIPE

   When the layer 2 protocol is PPP, the usage of various LIPE confi-
   guration options can be negociated via the IP Compression Protocol
   option of IPCP:

   IPCP Option 2: IP configuration protocol
       Network Protocol: TBD indicates LIPE
   sub-option 1 enables use of IP session
   sub-option 2 enables use of UDP/IP session


9.  Security

   This draft does not impose additional security considerations beyond
   those that apply to PPP and header-compression schemes over PPP.


10.  Summary

   LIPE is designed to support multimedia traffic when certain resource
   guarantees are available from the underlying network. It is based on
   UDP/IP or IP; hence is lightweight compared with other proposals
   based on RTP [1,2]. As IP based networks become more and more sophis-
   ticated and offer various levels of resource guarantees [5], this
   scheme is more suitable to the modern/future IP architecture compared
   with RTP based schemes.

   The 15-bit UserID field in LIPE facilitates its usage in the third
   generation wireless system where handoffs may occur during the life-
   time of a session. By having a larger user space, we can greatly
   reduce the signalling overhead due to identifier re-negotiation dur-
   ing a handoff.

   A multiplexing policy is also outlined for LIPE.
