Internet-Draft    Extensions to the Dialog event package for Third Party Call Control                                            June 2003


2. Introduction

   The dialog event package [4] defines a mechanism for monitoring the
   progress of INVITE dialogs involving a specific user through a
   subscription to that dialog state. The package allows for monitoring
   all dialogs for that user or a specific dialog identified by Call-ID
   and local and remote tags. Currently undefined is a mechanism for
   finer grained filtering of the dialogs for which state is provided.

   The state of a dialog is conveyed with respect to a finite state
   machine (FSM) defined in the Internet-Draft. This FSM reflects the
   transition from the initial INVITE, to a 100 Trying response, to a
   1xx response, through a final response (2xx). The application/
   dialog-info+xml MIME type defines additional attributes that augment
   this FSM state. Still, there is important information not immediately
   conveyed by the dialog event package. This missing information
   represents additional context for a dialog which helps the watcher
   determine which dialogs are interesting and which are not from the
   perspective of call control and advanced services [5].

   It is the intention of this document to address these issues by:

   o  defining an XML based MIME type for filtering notifications for
      the dialog event

   o  extending application/dialog-info+xml with new attributes and
      elements to provide additional context information

3. Use Cases

   The use cases of interest include the following:

   1.  The dialog event watcher wishes to be informed of all dialog
       state related to dialogs which match a given remote URI

   2.  The dialog event watcher wishes to know which dialogs are part of
       a larger conference

   3.  The dialog event watcher wishes to know when a dialog goes "on
       hold". "On hold" refers to the situation where the two parties of
       the dialog are not actively engaged in communication. This
       information is valuable feeback for the UA which is responsible
       for placing the dialog "on hold". It is also an indication that
       the "on hold" party may be available for communication.

   4.  The dialog event watcher wishes to know which dialogs are part of
       a call transfer operation

   5.  The dialog event watcher wishes to know the relationship between
       a new dialog and the dialog which it is replacing

4. A Filter for the dialog event package

   This memo defines a new MIME type (application/dialog-filter-qbe+xml)
   which is intended to be placed in the body of a SUBSCRIBE request for
   the dialog event package to serve as filter criteria for limiting the
   list of dialogs which are returned in subsequent NOTIFYs. It is
   expected that SIP devices which support this event package will also
   support more advanced conferencing and media services. Therefore, it
   will not be unusual for a given device to be a participant in many
   simultaneous INVITE dialogs of various types. This is the rationale
   behind providing a filtering ability at the subscription target
   rather than doing filtering at the watcher. One goal of this
   filtering is to reduce network traffic associated with these NOTIFYs.
   Another goal is to simplify the implementation of advanced services
   by allowing watchers to focus on a narrow subset of the dialogs
   associated with a user.

   The filter is specified in a query-by-example format. The subscriber
   specifies the remote URI, Call-ID, state, tags, etc. of interest and
   omits any element which it does not need to match explicitly (a
   "don't care" condition). Any element or attribute included in the
   filter which is not understood by the receiving UA MUST be ignored.
   The filter is composed of a sequence of one or more <dialog>
   elements. Each <dialog> element in the filter represents one filter
   criteria. The entire filter is the logical "or" of all of these
   criteria. Negation is not supported.

   The filter can be present in any SUBSCRIBE or re-SUBSCRIBE during the
   life of the subscription. The current filter is replaced (not
   ammended) by filters in subsequent SUBSCRIBE requests. A subsequent
   SUBSCRIBE lacking any filter removes the currently active filter. The
   filter is not persisted across subscriptions and is specific to the
   subscription dialog. Multiple subscriptions between two UAs may have
   independent filters. This memo does not define any mechanism for
   querying the currently active filter. Consequently, no versioning
   scheme is defined for these filters.

   A UA receiving a filter format which it does not understand or honor
   MUST return a 415 error response.

5. Extending application/dialog-info+xml

   There are three extensions proposed to the XML schema for the
   application/dialog-info+xml MIME type:

      An extension to indicate that a dialog is being established to
      replace another existing dialog

      An extension to indicate that a dialog is being established as a
      result of a refer request

      An extension to indicate the local Contact information for a
      dialog analogous to "remote-target"

   All of these extensions are intended to make it easier to correlate
   dialog information with actions such as blind and consultative
   transfer as well as multiparty conferencing.

5.1 The replaces element

   The <replaces> element is a proposed new child of the <dialog>
   element. The purpose is to capture the information of the Replaces
   headers [6] including the Call-ID, local tag, and remote tag of the
   dialog which this new dialog is intended to replace.

   Example of <replaces> element in dialog-info


      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
      <dialog-info xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:dialog-info" state="full" version="3" entity="a@tradewind.com">
              <dialog id="1" call-id="7777@b.tradewind.com" local-tag="456456" remote-tag="234903">
                      <state>confirmed</state>
              </dialog>
              <dialog id="2" call-id="4555@c.tradewind.com" local-tag="234231" remote-tag="982321">
                      <state>proceeding</state>
                      <replaces call-id="7777@b.tradewind.com" local-tag="456456" remote-tag="234903" />
              </dialog>
      </dialog-info>

          <xs:attribute name="remote-tag" type="xs:string" use="optional" />
       </xs:element>



5.2 The referred-by element

   The <referred-by> element is a proposed new child of the <dialog>
   element containing the name-addr of the source of the REFER which
   caused the creation of that dialog. The purpose of this element is to
   signal that a dialog was created as part of a call transfer and to
   identify the source of that transfer operation. The referred-by
   element SHOULD be included whenever an INVITE dialog is established
   in response to a REFER request.

   Example of <referred-by> element in dialog-info


      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
      <dialog-info xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:dialog-info" state="partial" version="3" entity="a@tradewind.com">

5.3 The local-target element

   The <local-target> element is a proposed child element of the
   <dialog> element. Its purpose and construction are similar to the
   remote-target element defined today. The local-target is intended to
   carry the local-target URI for this UA for this dialog as defined by
   SIP [2]. The local-target should be present whenever the
   remote-target element is present. The local-target (and
   remote-target) should be updated whenever a target refresh operation
   occurs for this dialog. The primary goal of conveying this
   information is to capture uniquely identifying information for
   dialogs which are part of a larger conference (such as the conference
   URI).

   Example of <local-target> element in dialog-info


      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
      <dialog-info xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:dialog-info" state="partial" version="3" entity="a@tradewind.com">

       </xs:element>



5.4 The local-media-state and remote-media-state elements

   The <local/remote-media-state> elements are proposed children of the
   <dialog> element. Their purpose is to convey the current
   directionality of media and consequently the level of participation
   of each party in the dialog. This information corresponds to the
   "sendonly", "sendrecv", "recvonly", and "inactive" attributes of SDP
   [7] and their usage as defined in RFC 3264 [3]. The default value for
   these elements in their absence is "sendrecv". Note that for
   backwards compatibility, a SDP connection address of "0.0.0.0" is to
   be interpreted and relayed as a media-state of "inactive".

   Example of <local/remote-media-state> element in dialog-info


      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
      <dialog-info xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:dialog-info" state="partial" version="3" entity="a@tradewind.com">
              <dialog id="4" call-id="4555@c.tradewind.com" local-tag="234231" remote-tag="982321">
                      <state>confirmed</state>
                      <local-media-state>sendonly</local-media-state>
                      <remote-media-state>inactive</remote-media-state>
              </dialog>
      </dialog-info>

7. Security Considerations

      The <referred-by> element is subject to the same security
      implications as a Referred-By header in a REFER request. Further
      investigation is necessary to determine how best to address this
      security concern. Namely, should the referred-by element contain
      an AIB or perhaps use xmlsig to integrity protect the information?
      Or should the entire dialog-info XML document be secured using S/
      MIME when a referred-by element is present?
