Abstract

   This document specifies an xmlns Media Feature per RFC 2506 [5] for
   identifying some or all of the URIs defining XML namespaces [14] in a
   given XML resource, and the relative importance of these namespaces.
   This feature is designed primarily for use with the XML Media Types
   defined in RFC 3023 [12], to provide additional hints as to the
   processing requirements of a given XML resource.

1. Introduction

   MIME Content-Type identifiers have proven very useful as tools for
   describing homogeneous information.  They do not fare as well at
   describing content which is unpredictably heterogeneous.  XML
   documents may be homogeneous, but are also frequently heterogeneous.
   It is not difficult to create, for instance, an  XHTML [26] document
   which also contains RDF [19] metadata, MathML [20] equations,
   hypertext using XLink [22], XForms [25],and SVG [21] graphics.  XSLT
   [17] stylesheets routinely include information in both the XSLT
   namespace and in the namespaces of the literal result elements.

   RFC 3023 [12] defines a set of XML media types capable of indicating,
   among other things, a 'most important' type for an XML resource.  For
   example, the content-type header:

        Content-Type: application/xslt+xml

   indicates that the data is XML and that it should be processed by an
   XSLT processor.  In XML terminology, this is more or less the same as
   saying that the XSLT 'namespace' is the "most important" namespace
   relevant to the processing of the data.

   This content-type statement does not imply that there is only one
   namespace associated with the resource, nor does it is necessarily
   identify the namespace of the root element of the resource.  Indeed,
   this example content-type could easily be associated with a resource
   whose root element is in the XHTML namespace, but where the resource
   requires processing by an XSLT processor to generate XHTML output
   suitable for display.

   Moreover, XML data can contain many different 'types' of data, each
   identified by a namespace URI, and successful processing of a
   resource may depend on knowledge of some or all of these.  For
   example, using XSLT to produce XHTML output is likely useful only if
   the recipient is also capable of processing XHTML.  Similarly, a
   program may be better able to choose among a set of XSLT stylesheets
   if it knows the namespaces of the results they generate, or a
   renderer may take advantage of foreknowledge to begin setting up
   components before content actually arrives.  Alternatively,
   processors working with SOAP [18] envelopes may find it useful to
   know what they will be facing inside the envelope.

   The Media feature described in this document can provide additional
   information about some or all of the namespaces relevant to a given
   XML resource beyond that indicated by the basic content-type.  Such a
   list can provide guidance to a recipient application as to how best
   to process the XML data it receives.

   It is important to recall that, like all MIME header data, the
   namespace information in a Media feature is specific to a given
   application context.  Thus the same XML resource, delivered to
   different applications, may have different namespace information
   associated with it.

   Applications faced with "unknown" XML namespaces may want to attempt
   to download RDDL [16] documents to collect information on how to
   process them.  Applications may also choose to reject documents
   containing unknown namespaces.

2. Registration

   Media feature tag name: xmlns

   ASN.1 identifier associated with feature tag: New assignment by IANA

   Summary of the media feature indicated by this feature tag: This
      feature tag is used to identify XML namespaces either contained in
      a given document or processable by a given recipient.

   Values appropriate for use with this feature tag: The feature tag
      must contain a String conforming to the RFC 2396 [4] syntax for
      URI references, as restricted by plenary [15].  URI references
      must be absolute.  Alternatively, in place of a URI, the empty
      string may be used to represent "no default namespace" as defined
      in Section 5.2 of Namespaces in XML [14]

   The feature tag is intended primarily for use in the following
   applications, protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms: Any
      protocol that exchanges XML-formatted information in MIME
      encapsulation

      Examples of typical use:



      For an XHTML document containing SVG, MathML, SMIL, and XLink
      content:

        Content-Type: application/xhtml+xml
        Content-features: (|
           (xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML")
           (xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/SMIL20/")
           (xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg")
           (xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml")
           (xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink")
        )

      Note that order is not important in this list.

Internet-Draft                xmlns feature                February 2002


      Or, using multiple Content-features headings:

        Content-Type: application/xhtml+xml
        Content-features: (xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML")
        Content-features: (xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/SMIL20/")
        Content-features: (xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg")
        Content-features: (xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml")
        Content-features: (xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink")

      Again, note that order is not important in this list.

      For an application indicating that it accepts SMIL, XHTML, or SVG
      content:

     (| (xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/SMIL20/");q=1.0
        (xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml");q=0.9
        (xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg");q=0.8
        )

      Applications that want to specify combinations of namespaces they
      consider acceptable may do so using combinations of & and |, and
      may also mix the xmlns feature with other media features, as
      described in RFC 2533 [6].

   Related standards or documents: Namespaces in XML [14], XML Media
      Types [12]

   Considerations particular to use in individual applications,
   protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms: None

   Interoperability considerations: None.

   Security considerations: If it is known that there is a security bug
      in the handling of a particular namespace in a particular
      environment, knowing that a device can accept that namespace may
      slightly help an attacker.

   Additional information: None

3. Registration issues

3.1 General interest to the Internet Community

   While XML processing may generally seem like something specific to
   the XML community, XML's reach is growing rapidly.  XML is now in
   regular use for Web Services (XML-RPC, SOAP), vector graphics (SVG),
   mathematics (MathML), instant messaging (Jabber), information
   transformation (XSLT), and a wide variety of other projects.

   Because of this general and growing interest, this document
   recommends registering the 'xmlns' feature in the IETF tree per RFC
   2506 [5].

3.2 Namespaces as Media Features

   Namespaces are not strictly presentational media information, as are
   many of the previously registered media features.  They do, however,
   define the set of tools used to present information, much as the type
   [10], charset [11], and language [11] media features do.

3.3 Relation to MIME Media Types

   While namespaces, especially on the root element, are often linked to
   a particular MIME Media Type, these connections are not always
   direct.

   There are well-known cases (especially in XSLT) where the root
   element's relation to the rest of the document is misleading.  A
   commonly-used XSLT practice uses a shell document with stylesheet
   instructions nested inside.  Applications which only look at the
   namespace of the root document will encounter trouble (whether they
   notice it or not) in rendering the document as expected by its
   designers and probable readers.

   There are other cases where the root element's relation to the rest
   of the document is tenuous or even irrelevant.  A collection of rules
   for processing namespaces [28], for one example, can contain rules in
   various namespaces, and can even reside quite naturally in documents
   whose root element has nothing explicit to do with namespace
   processing.

   In these cases, some mechanism must determine the overall MIME Media
   Type.  The list of xmlns Media Features can supplement the Media
   Type, but applications should look to the Media Type initially.

3.4 Security Considerations

   Security considerations for this registration are listed in the
   registration above.  Considerations for Media Features in general are
   described in RFC 2506.

3.5 IANA Considerations

   Section 2 of this document calls for the registration of a media
   feature tag, per RFC 2506.
