1.  Introduction

   Several DNS encryption technologies have been introduced, including
   DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS and so on.  The work of the Adaptive
   DNS Discovery working group includes supporting client discovery of
   encrypted DNS resolution services and communication mechanisms for
   selection decisions.

   Since the proposal of the draft plan should be guided by the existing
   problems, the working group should first reach a consensus on the
   problems to be solved and the principles applicable to each problem,
   and then promote follow-up work on this basis.

   This document discusses various usage scenarios and corresponding
   requirements for discovering and using encrypted DNS technology.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   Encrypted DNS: DNS-over-HTTPS[RFC8484], DNS-over-TLS[RFC7858] or any
   other encrypted DNS technology that the IETF may publish, for
   example, DNS-over-QUIC [I-D.ietf-dprive-dnsoquic].

3.  Discover and use of encrypted DNS services

   The DNS client accesses the recursive server with discovery function,
   and the discussion is divided into the following situations:

3.1.  The client automatically obtains DNS resolution service

   1) Ordinary DNS resolution service

   The client can automatically obtain the common DNS recursive
   resolution server address through DHCP.

   2) Encrypted DNS resolution service

   The client can choose several types of encryption resolution services
   currently provided (such as DOH/DOT, etc.), and accept the default
   configuration of the recursive server.

   The encrypted DNS recursive resolution server address can be
   automatically set through DHCP/RA/PPP and other protocols.

3.2.  The client has been configured with parameters

   If the client has been configured with parameters, the following two
   aspects are initially considered for configuration parameters:

   1) For general DNS resolution services, the client can update and
   configure the encrypted DNS recursive resolution server type and
   address.  This method is suitable for common networks and specific
   networks.

   2) Users can set to use the specified encrypted DNS resolution
   service when accessing certain specific domain names.  Set up a list
   of mapping relationships between domain names and DNS resolution
   service addresses.

3.3.  Configuration examples


   *Normal DNS resolution (single choice)
     -Obtain DNS server address automatically (single choice)
     -Use the following DNS server address (single choice)
       First choice: ____._____.____.____
       Alternative: ____._____.____.____

   *Encrypted DNS resolution (single choice)
     -Type: DOT/DOH
     -Obtain DNS server address automatically (single choice)
     -Use the following encrypted DNS server address (single choice)
       First choice: ____._____.____.____
       Alternative: ____._____.____.____

   Domain name       Type     Address
   www.google.com    DOT      xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx


4.  Encrypted DNS resolution service list

4.1.  Provide a public encrypted DNS resolution service address list

   We can provide an encrypted DNS recursive resolution server address
   list, which can be publicly maintained and updated regularly.  The
   priority of selecting an encrypted DNS resolver is determined by the
   server's own design.  Currently Mozilla maintains a similar list
   relationship.

4.2.  Provide encrypted DNS resolution configuration for some specific
      domain names

   If some companies or institutions want to use their own encrypted DNS
   resolution service when accessing their own domain names, they will
   provide the resolution server through the mapping relationship.

5.  IANA Considerations

   To be added.

6.  Security Considerations

   To be added.

7.  Acknowledgment

   The authors would like to thank Jiankang Yao, and Linlin Zhou for
   their careful review and valuable comments.
