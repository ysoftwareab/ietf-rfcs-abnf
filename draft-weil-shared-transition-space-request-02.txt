Internet-Draft       Shared Transition Space Request           July 2011


1.  Introduction

   Many operators are currently implementing their IPv6 transition
   plans.  During the transition, continued support for heritage IPv4
   only devices will be required.  While most operators are well aware
   of the limitations of Carrier Grade NAT, particularly NAT444
   [I-D.shirasaki-nat444] (see [I-D.donley-nat444-impacts]), it is the
   transition mechanism that has the least customer impact for many
   carriers.

   To deploy Carrier Grade NAT, it becomes necessary for a provider to
   create an inside address pool that will not conflict with its
   customer address space.  This document requests that IANA reserve a
   /10 of IPv4 addresses to use as Shared Transition Space.  As IANA has
   exhausted its pool of addresses, one or more RIR(s) or legacy address
   holder(s) will need to supply IANA with such addresses (e.g. per ARIN
   Draft Policy 2011-5 [ARIN]).

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Motivation

   The Internet community is rapidly consuming the remaining supply of
   unallocated IPv4 addresses.  During the transition period to IPv6, it
   is imperative that Service Providers maintain IPv4 service for
   devices and networks that are currently incapable of upgrading to
   IPv6.

   In order to provide IPv4 service to customers and/or devices once the
   IPv4 address space is exhausted, Service Providers must multiplex
   several subscribers behind a single IPv4 address using one of several
   techniques including NAT444 or Carrier Grade NAT.  Providers need
   sufficient non-[RFC1918] address space to deploy such technologies
   and avoid overlap with customer use of private address space.

   Many CPE router devices used to provide residential or small-medium
   business services have been optimized for IPv4 operation, and
   typically require replacement in order to fully support the
   transition to IPv6 (either natively or via one of many transition
   technologies).  In addition, various consumer devices including IP-
   enabled televisions, gaming consoles, medical and family monitoring
   devices, etc. are IPv4-only, and cannot be upgraded.  While these
   will eventually be replaced with dual-stack or IPv6 capable devices,
   this transition will take many years.  As these are typically
   consumer-owned devices, service providers do not have control over
   the speed of their replacement cycle.  However, consumers have an
   expectation that they will continue to receive IPv4 service, and that
   such devices will continue to have IPv4 Internet connectivity after
   the IPv4 pool is exhausted, even if the customer contracts for new
   service with a new provider.

   Until such customers replace their Home Gateways and all IPv4-only
   CPE devices with IPv6-capable devices, Service Providers will be
   required to continue to offer IPv4 services through the use of an
   IPv4 address sharing technology such as NAT444
   [I-D.shirasaki-nat444].  The challenges associated with these
   deployments are identified in [I-D.shirasaki-nat444-isp-shared-addr],
   [I-D.donley-nat444-impacts], and
   [I-D.ietf-intarea-shared-addressing-issues].

   Addressing solutions for dealing with the depletion of the IPv4
   public address space and the lack of available private addresses
   within large providers are presented in
   [I-D.azinger-additional-private-ipv4-space-issues] as well as
   [I-D.shirasaki-nat444-isp-shared-addr].  For infrastructure providers
   whose customers are already using [RFC1918] space, as described in
   [I-D.bdgks-arin-shared-transition-space] and [ARIN], the preferred
   method for addressing the problems presented in both documents is to

   direct IANA to reserve address space for Shared Transition Space.

4.  Shared Transition Space

   This document proposes the assignment of a /10 as Shared Transition
   Space.  Shared Transition Space is IPv4 address space reserved for
   Infrastructure provider use with the purpose of facilitating IPv6
   transition and IPv4 coexistence deployment.  The requested block
   SHOULD NOT be utilized for any purpose other than as "inside"
   addresses in a carrier NAT environment (e.g. between the CGN and
   customer CPE devices) or for other IPv4 to IPv6 transition
   infrastructure.  Network equipment manufacturers MUST NOT use the
   assigned block in default or example device configurations.

   Because Shared Transition addresses have no meaning outside of the
   Infrastructure Provider, routing information about shared transition
   space networks MUST NOT be propagated on interdomain links, and
   packets with shared transition source or destination addresses SHOULD
   NOT be forwarded across such links.  Internet service providers
   SHOULD filter out routing information about shared transition space
   networks on ingress links.

5.  Security Considerations

   This memo does not define any protocol, and raises no security
   issues.  Any addresses allocated as Shared Transition Space would not
   be routable on the Internet.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to reserve an IPv4 /10 for use as Shared Transition
   Space.  This prefix is intended to be non-routable.  As IANA has
   exhausted its pool of IPv4 address space, it may be necessary for one
   or more RIRs and/or legacy address holders to provide such addresses
   for IANA reservation (e.g. per ARIN Draft Policy 2011-5 [ARIN]).
