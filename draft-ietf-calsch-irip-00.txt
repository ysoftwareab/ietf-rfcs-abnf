Abstract
This document specifies a binding from the iCalendar Transport-
independent Interoperability Protocol [ITIP] to a real-time transport.
Calendaring entries defined by the iCalendar Object Model [ICAL] are
composed using constructs from [RFC-2045], [RFC-2046], [RFC-2047], [RFC-
2048] and [RFC-2049].

This document is based on the calendaring and scheduling model defined
by [ICMS].

This document is based on discussions within the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF) Calendaring and Scheduling (CALSCH) working group.
More information about the IETF CALSCH working group activities can be

1.1  Related Memos

Implementors will need to be familar with several other memos that,
along with this memo, form a framework for Internet calendaring and
scheduling standards.

This document - specifies an Internet email binding for [ITIP].

[ICMS] - specifies a common terminology and abstract;

[ICAL] - specifies a core specification of objects, data types,
properties and property parameters;

[ITIP] - specifies an interoperability protocol for scheduling between
different implementations;

[IMIP] - specifies a messaging-based protocol binding for [ITIP].

This memo does not attempt to repeat the specification of concepts or
definitions from these other memos. Where possible, references are made
to the memo that provides for the specification of these concepts or
definitions.


1.2  Formatting Conventions

The mechanisms defined in this memo are defined in propose. In order to
refer to elements of the calendaring and scheduling model, core object
or interoperability protocol defined in [ICMS], [ICAL] and [ITIP] some
formatting conventions have been used.

Calendaring and scheduling roles defined by [ICMS] are referred to in
quoted-strings of text with the first character of each word in upper
case. For example, "Organizer" refers to a role of a "Calendar User"
within the scheduling protocol defined by [ITIP]

Calendar components defined by [ICAL] are referred to with capitalized,
quoted-strings of text. All calendar components start with the letter
"V". For example, "VEVENT" refers to the event calendar component,
"VTODO" refers to the to-do calendar component and "VJOURNAL" refers to
the daily journal calendar component.

Scheduling methods defined by [ITIP] are referred to with capitalized,
quoted-strings of text. For example, "REQUEST" refers to the method for
requesting a scheduling calendar component be created or modified,
"REPLY" refers to the method a recipient of a request uses to update
their status with the "Organizer" of the calendar component.

Properties defined by [ICAL] are referred to with capitalized, quoted-
strings of text, followed by the word "property". For example,
"ATTENDEE" property refers to the iCalendar property used to convey the
calendar address of a calendar user.

Property parameters defined by [ICAL] are referred to with lower case,
quoted-strings of text, followed by the word "parameter". For example,
"VALUE" parameter refers to the iCalendar property parameter used to
override the default data type for a property value.


2. Architecture

The goal of iRIP is to enable real-time interoperability between
scheduling systems using the iCalendar [ICAL] format for information
exchange. iRIP is designed primarily to allow Calendar Services (CS) as
defined in [ICSM] to forward real-time requests on behalf of Calendar
User Agents (CUA). The goal of iRIP is to allow two or more CS's to
establish connections between them and operate as a single  Calendar
Domain.

iRIP allows a CS to initiate a session and perform operations on behalf
of multiple CUA's without the need to reauthenticate the session for
each CUA.

The design of iRIP does not preclude its use from CUA directly to CS,
however. iRIP does not support client access functions such as calendar
browsing, retrieval and search. These requirements will be addressed by
the Calendar Access Protocol (CAP).

Terms used in the following discussion include:

. the User, the CU that initiates a request.
. the Sender, the agent used to contact a receiving device, send
  commands, and receive replies, and
. the Receiver, the agent that accepts commands and sends replies.


The Sender and Receiver can take on varying roles of CUA and CS as
described in [ICMS].

iRIP allows two CS's to establish different levels of trust so that
scheduling operations can be performed as efficiently as possible. When
an iRIP connection is first established, both parties to the connection
authenticate one another using the AUTHENTICATE command. The Sender can
then initiate commands which the Receiver MUST interpret relative to the
Sender's access control. If proxy operations are required, then an
authentication that supports both the authorization user id and
authentication user id must be used.


2.1  State Diagram

An iRIP session begins when a TCP/IP connection is made on port 5228.
The protocol begins in the Connected state. The AUTHENTICATE command,
when successful, begins the Authenticated state. From the Authenticated
state, the sender can initiate a request using the RECIPIENT command.
The Sender can then issues as many RECIPIENT commands as the operation
in progress requires until sending an ICALDATA command. After issuing

the ICALDATA command, the Sender must wait for a response from the
receiver. The Receiver can respond that the request has been completed
or that the request could not be completed in the time specified by the
Sender. When the Receive has ended, the Sender returns to the
Authenticated state where another request can be initiated.

>From the Authenticated state, the Sender can issue a PROXY command to
indicate that the following command is being performed on behalf of
another party. After the PROXY command succeeds and the send and receive
are accomplished, the PROXY information is cleared and the Sender
returns to the Authenticated state.

           +--------------CONTINUE---------------+


2.2  Bounded Latency

iRIP is designed so that the Sender can either obtain an immediate
response from a request or discover within a known amount of time that
the request cannot be completed. When the Sender initiates a command
that the Receiver cannot complete within a given amount of time, the
Receiver can return an error code to the Sender indicating this
condition. The Sender then issues either a CONTINUE or ABORT command.
The ABORT command immediately terminates the command in progress. The
CONTINUE command instructs the Receiver to continue processing the
command. The ABORT command causes the Receiver to discard the current
command and return to the Authenticated state.


3. Commands

In the examples below, lines preceded with "S:" refer to the Sender and
lines preceded with "R:" refer to the Receiver.

Internet Draft                   iRIP                 November 21, 1997


3.1  ABORT

The ABORT command is issued by the Sender to stop an ICALDATA request
from being processed further. When the latency time is specified on the
ICALDATA command, the Receiver must issue a reply to the Sender within
the specified time.  The reply may be a reply code indicating that the
server has not yet processed the request.  The Sender must then tell the
server whether to continue or abort.

Example:

...
S: ICALDATA:10
R: 3.5.4 Start ICAL input; end with <CRLF>.<CRLF>
S: Content-Type:text/calendar; method=REQUEST; charset=US-ASCII
S: Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
S:
S: BEGIN:VCALENDAR
S: ...
S: END:VCALENDAR
S: .
<after 10 seconds...>
R: .
R: 3.5.0  Reply Pending
S: ABORT
R: 2.5 OK

3.2  AUTHENTICATE

The authentication mechanism used in iRIP is based on [SASL]. This
allows the iRIP senders and receivers to dynamically negotiate
authentication and encryption mechanisms. SASL defines authentication
methods such as ANONYMOUS and encapsulates concepts of PROXY used in
iRIP.

The AUTHENTICATE command is used by the client to identify itself to the
server. Authenticate is required before any other command can be used
and must be the first one sent following the server's welcome message.
The format of the command is of the following:

AUTHENTICATE <mechanism> <initial data>

from which the standard SASL interchange will take place as defined in
the SASL profile.

Example of an authentication session:

R: Welcome IRIP Server
S: AUTHENTICATE KERBEROS_V4 744RTU3r#
S: sfdkjgs;lfdjg s;ldfkj gslkfdjgwrt949jsl4ns.dlngsdf
S: slkfjgsdlfjg;dslfjgdsfg
S: ;lasfgsdfg  45243 z!$14325dc
R: OK Kerberos V4 authentication successful

3.2.1     Authentication with Proxy Access

The proxy mechanism is the ability to have data posted from through an
indirect source. To handle this requirement, SASL mechanisms have a
separate _Authentication_ and _authorization_ identity. Thus, server A
could authenticate to server B using server A's credentials with the
authorization identity of user X. This effectively allows PROXY
operations between servers.  Some older SASL mechanisms do not support
both authentication and authorization and therefore can't be used when
PROXY operations are required.  As per the SASL profile, the
authorization identity is the one used to determine if the operation
should be allowed or not. The authentication identity ensures the
transaction is originating from a trusted sender.


3.2.2     Authentication for Anonymous Access

SASL defines an ANONYMOUS authentication mechanism that must be used if
anonymous access is to be implemented by an iRIP capable server. This is
done by using the standard SASL authentication method and requesting the
ANONYMOUS mechanism. The mechanism consists of a single message from the
client to the server. The client sends optional trace information in the
for of a human readable string. It is recommended that the trace
information take one of three forms: An [RFC-822] Internet e-mail
address, an opaque ASCII string wich does not contain the _@_ character
and can be interpreted by the system administrator of the client's
domain or nothing.

 The following is an example of anonymous access using an opaque ASCII
string:

R: <listen on TCP port 5228>
S: <establish a connection to TCP port 5228>
R: 2.2 AboutTime iRIPServer@xyx.com Ready
S: AUTHENTICATE ANONYMOUS
R: +
S: c21yaGM
R: 2.2 Welcome anonymous

An iRIP capable server permitting anonymous access will permit
operations, usually restricted to limited and non-destructive commands.

To properly implement the ANONYMOUS authentication, refer to [ANON-
SASL].


3.3  CAPABILITY

The CAPABILITY command tells the server to return a list of capabilities
it supports.  The server must return a CAPABILITY response with
"IRIPrev1" as one of the listed capabilities.  The CAPBILITY command can
be issued in any connection state and the reply is not dependent upon
the connection state.

Internet Draft                   iRIP                 November 21, 1997


A capability name which begins with "AUTH=" indicates that the server
supports that particular authentication mechanism.

Example:

S: CAPABILITY
R: CAPABILITY IRIPrev1 AUTH=KERBEROS_V4
R: 2.0 OK

3.4  CONTINUE

The CONTINUE command is issued by the Sender to allow an ICALDATA
request to continue being processed. When the latency time is specified
on the ICALDATA command, the Receiver must issue a reply to the Sender
within the specified time.  The reply may be a reply code indicating
that the server has not yet processed the request.  The Sender must then
tell the server whether to continue or abort.

Example:

...
S: ICALDATA:10
R: 354 Start ICAL input; end with <CRLF>.<CRLF>
S: BEGIN:VCALENDAR
   ...
S: END:VCALENDAR
S: .
<after 10 seconds...>
R: .
R: 3.5.0  Reply Pending
S: CONTINUE
R: BEGIN:VCALENDAR
...
R: END:VCALENDAR
R: .
R: 2.0 OK

3.5  DISCONNECT

The DISCONNECT command signals the end of communication between the
Sender and Receiver.

Example:

S: DISCONNECT
R: 2.1 EXAMPLE.COM IRIP Service closing transmission channel


3.6  ICALDATA

The ICALDATA is used specify the iCalendar Object that is to be
delivered to one or more recipients specified in the RECIPIENT command.
The format of the command is:



Courtemanche/Mansour/O'Leary      7                    Expires May 1998


Internet Draft                   iRIP                 November 21, 1997


S: ICALDATA[:latencyTime]
S: <MIME encapsulated iCalendar Object>
S: <CRLF>.<CRLF>
R: <MIME encapsulated iCalendar Object >
R: <CRLF>.<CRLF>
R: <reply code>

An optional argument to ICALDATA specifies the maximum amount of time
the Sender can wait for a reply.  This is followed by iCalendar Object
data.  The data is terminated by the special sequence <CRLF>.<CRLF>. The
server reply may optionally contain an iCalendar Object, the special
sequence <CRLF>.<CRLF> followed by a reply code.


S: ICALDATA
R: 3.5.4 Start ICAL input; end with <CRLF>.<CRLF>
S: Content-Type:text/calendar; method=REQUEST; charset=US-ASCII
S: Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
S:
S: BEGIN:VCALENDAR
S: etc., etc.
S: END:VCALENDAR
S: .
R: .
R: 2.0 OK

3.7  RECIPIENT

The RECIPIENT command is used to identify a recipient of the iCalendar
Object.  Use multiple RECIPIENT commands to specify multiple recipients.
The command format is


RECIPIENT rfc822address <or something ...>


3.8  SWITCH

The SWITCH command is used to allow the Sender and Receiver to change
roles.  Its format is:

SWITCH


The SWITCH command is useful in environments where the firewall of a
Sender would not allow the Receiver to initiate a connection. The SWITCH
command is issued by the Sender to give the Receiver the opportunity to
take the role of the Sender.

The Receiver must respond in one of the following fashions:

. send an OK reply and take on the role of  Sender
. send a error reply indicating refusal and retain the role of Receiver



Courtemanche/Mansour/O'Leary      8                    Expires May 1998


Internet Draft                   iRIP                 November 21, 1997


If program-A is currently the Sender and sends the SWITCH command and
receives an OK reply then program-A becomes the Receiver.  Program-A is
then in its initial state and sends a service ready greeting message.

If program-B is currently the Receiver and sends an OK reply in response
to a SWITCH command then program-B becomes the Sender.  Program-B is
then in the initial state as if the transmission channel just opened,
and expects to receive a service ready greeting.


3.9  Error Codes

iRIP error codes follow the format defined for Status Replies in [ITIP].
All Status Replies as defined in [ITIP] are valid error codes when
returned by an iRIP command.

In addition to those defined in [ITIP], iRIP defines the following error
codes:

6.0    AUTHORIZATION FAILED    General authorization failure

6.1    TRANSITION-NEEDED       Indicates the transition from
                               a legacy database to a more
                               secure password mechanism, and
                               reports that the new mechanism
                               is not usable until "AUTHENTICATE
                               PLAIN" or a login procedure is used.

6.2    AUTH-TOO-WEAK           Indicates that multiple remote
                               services are offered, and therefore
                               there is no practical way to transition
                               every remote service. So, the mechanism
                               must not allow users to have different
                               passwords for different services. The
                               error code reports that no new plaintext
                               passwords will be accepted from the user
                               at a later date. It could also indicate
                               that the requested mechanism is not
                               available.

6.3    ENCRYPT-NEEDED          Indicates that the requested mechanism
                               it to be used in conjunction with a
                               strong external encryption layer.

7.0    TIMEOUT                 The requested operation could not be
                               completed in the time allotted.

8.0    GENERAL FAILURE         A failure has occurred in the Receiver
                               that prevents the operation from
                               succeeding.
8.1    SERVER TOO BUSY         Sent when a connection cannot be
                               established because the iRIP Receiver
                               is too busy.

9.0    INVALID IRIP COMMAND    An unrecongnized command was received.

10.0   NOT HERE                The Receiver does not know how to
                               contact the Calendar Store for the
                               specified RECIPIENT.

10.1   REFERRAL                Accompanied by an alternate address.
                               The RECIPIENT specified should be
                               contacted at the given alternate
                               address.

4. Security Considerations

The security of iRIP with SASL support is highly dependent on the
mechanism used to authenticate the client and whether or not the
security layer is further negotiated. Without a robust security layer,
iRIP transactions are subject to eavesdropping and the integrity of iRIP
transactions may be compromised. Since iRIP is designed specifically for
real time Internet transactions, it is recommended that implementations
use the highest degree of authentication and transmission security
possible.

Authentication is fundamental to iRIP. It is the basis for granting and
denying access. Without a robust security layer iRIP will be subject to
many possible attacks and the full contents of the server itself may be
at risk.


4.1  SASL ANONYMOUS Mechanism

Implementing support for the Anonymous SASL significantly increases the
vulnerability of the calendar server and its data. Refer to [ANON-SASL]
for further information on many threats specific to Anonymous SASL
access.


4.2  SASL Profile Definition

(Need to complete with full details)

The implementation of SASL in iRIP requires the server and client to
comply to the following profile extension:

AUTHENTICATE command.

Full description of the challenge/response definition.

Starting octet.

Interpretation of the authorization identity passed should be
interpreted.

4.3  ITIP Threats

Threat: Spoofing the organizer or attendee.

Solution: The entire protection for spoofing attendees or organizer of a
meeting resides in the fact that the connection needs to be
authenticated. Spoofing would be possible in the absence of
authentication.

Threat: Eavesdropping on the traffic.

Solution: If SASL is used to negotiate with the server a security layer,
then traffic is no longer in the clear and eavesdropping will not be
restricted.

Threat: Flooding of a calendar

Solution: Implementation of iRIP should limit the size and traffic of
transaction from a given source.

Threat: Procedural Alarms

Solution: Implementation of iRIP should remove or disallow procedural
alarms before delivery.


4.4  IRIP-Specific Threats

Threat: Flooding of connections

Solution: Connections that have not been authenticated within 3 seconds
should be disconnected. Peter/Steve, this looks very arbitrary. Is there
a better way of doing this ?
