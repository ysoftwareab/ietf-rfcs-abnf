1.  Introduction

   NTP version 4 [RFC5905] has seen active use for over a decade, and
   within this time period the protocol has not only been extended to
   support new requirements but also fallen victim to vulnerabilities
   that have made it used for distributed denial of service (DDoS)
   amplification attacks.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Use cases and existing deployments of NTP

   There are several common scenarios for exxisting NTPv4 deployments;
   publicly accessible NTP services such as the NTP Pool [ntppool] are
   used to offer clock synchronisation for end users and embedded
   devices, ISP provided servers to synchronise devices such as
   customer-premesis equipment where reduced accuracy may be tollerable.
   Depending on the network and path these deployments may be affected
   by variable latency as well as throttling or blocking by providers.

Internet-Draft      NTPv5 use cases and requirements       November 2020


   Data centres and cloud computing providers also have deployed and
   offer NTP services both for internal use and for customers,
   particularly where the network is unable to offer or does not require
   PTP [IEEE-1588-2008].  As these deployments are less likely to be
   constrained by network latency or power the potential for higher
   levels of accuracy and precision within the bounds of the protocol
   are possible.

3.  Requirements

   At a high level, NTPv5 should be a protocol that is capable of
   operating in both local networks and also over public internet
   connections where packet loss, delay, and even filtering may occur.

   Timestamp resolution SHOULD either match or exceed NTPv4, and be
   extensible to represent any specified timescale.

   The protocol SHOULD NOT transmit time zone information and should
   focus on providing clock synchronisation as TZDIST [RFC7808] already
   provides this ability.

3.1.  IP affinity

   Servers SHOULD have a new identifier that peers use as reference,
   this SHOULD NOT be a FQDN, an IP address, or identifier tied to a
   certificate.  Servers SHOULD be able to migrate and change their
   identifiers as stratum topologies or network configuration changes
   occur.

   Clients SHOULD re-establish connections with servers at an interval
   to prevent attempting to maintain connectivity to dead host and give
   network operators the ability to move traffic away from IP addresses
   in a timely manner.  This functionality should also compliment having
   a "Kiss of Death" or similar message from servers.

3.2.  Algorithms

   Algorithms describing functions such as clock filtering, selection
   and clustering SHOULD be omitted from the specification; the
   specification should instead only provide only what is necessary to
   describe protocol semantics and normative behaviours.

   The working group should consider creating a separate informational
   document to describe an algorithm to assist with implementation, and
   to consider adopting future documents which describe new algorithms
   as they are developed.

3.3.  Timescales

   Support SHOULD be available for other timescales in addition to UTC -
   this should include, but not limited to the use of TAI or Modified
   Julian Date as defined in [I-D.ietf-ntp-roughtime].  Consideration
   should be made to include listing the supported timescales either as
   part of specific IANA parameter registry, or as part of the extension
   registry.

3.4.  Leap seconds

   The specification or the protocol SHOULD be explicit about when a
   leap second is being applied, and the protocol should allow for
   transmiting an upcoming leap second ahead of the day it is to be
   applicable.

3.4.1.  Leap second smearing

   Server responses SHOULD include not only an indicator as to wether
   the server supports smearing, but also if the current time being
   transmitted is smeared.  The protocol may also transmit the start/end
   or duration of the smearing ahead of time.

3.5.  Backwards compatibility to NTS and NTPv4

   The support for compatibility with other protocols SHOULD NOT prevent
   addressing issues that have previous caused issues in deployments or
   cause ossification of the protocol.

4.  IANA Considerations

   Considerations should be made about the future of the existing IANA
   registry for NTPv4 parameters.  If NTPv5 becomes incompatible with
   these parameters a new registry SHOULD be created.

5.  Security Considerations

   Encryption and authentication MUST be provided by the protocol
   specification as a default and MUST be resistent to downgrade
   attacks.  The encryption used must have agility, allowing for the
   protocol to update as more secure cryptography becomes known and
   vulnerabilities are discovered.

   The specification MAY consider leaving room for middleboxes which may
   deliberately modify packets in flight for legitimate purposes.
   Thought must be given around how this will be incorporated into any
   applicable trust model.

   Detection and reporting of server malfeasence SHOULD remain out of
   scope of this specification as [I-D.ietf-ntp-roughtime] already
   provides this capability as a core functionality of the protocol.
