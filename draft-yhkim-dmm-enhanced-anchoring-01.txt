Abstract

   This document presents a new perspective for the solution design of
   enhanced mobility anchoring in a distributed mobility management
   deployment. Based on the definition of anchor function, location
   management function, and forwarding management function in RFC7429,
   we propose four cases of distributed deployment models and 
   enhanced anchoring models over them.

1. Introduction

   This document presents a new perspective for the solution design of
   enhanced mobility anchoring in a distributed mobility management
   deployment.

   [RFC7333] defines the requirements for distributed mobility
   management (DMM), in order to fundamentally address the scalability
   issues derived from a centralized mobility management (CMM)
   deployment. Based on the given requirements, there may have diverse
   design solutions for enhancing mobility anchoring, depending on a
   view point looking at mobility anchor function.

   [RFC7429] specifies mobility management functions with three roles:
   anchoring functions (AF), internetwork location management (LM)
   function, and forwarding management (FM) function.

Internet-Draft        Enhanced Anchoring in DMM             March 2015


   Based on the given definitions of mobility management functions, a
   mobility anchor node can be considered. Basically, a mobility router
   needs to have the FM function for data distribution over a mobile
   network, while deployment of the other functions such as AF and LM
   can be considered with combinatorial cases. That is, FM is
   distributed while AF and LM can be distributed or centralized.
   Taking those deployment combinations, we provide four deployment
   models for anchor switching.

2. Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Mobility router (MR) denotes a network entity, which has mobility
   access and anchor functionality. Specifically, the entity is split
   into following functions, defined in [RFC7429].

   Anchoring Function (AF) is a control-plane function, which allocates
   an IP address, i.e., Home Address (HoA), or prefix, i.e., Home
   Network Prefix (HNP) a mobile node, topologically anchored by the
   advertising node. That is, the anchor node is able to advertise a
   connected route into the routing infrastructure for the allocated IP
   prefixes.

   Internetwork Location Management (LM) is a control-plane function,
   which manages and keeps track of the internetwork location of an MN.
   The location information may be a binding of the advertised IP
   address/prefix, e.g., HoA or HNP, to the IP routing address of the
   MN, or it may be a binding of a node that can forward packets
   destined to the MN.

   Forwarding Management (FM) function performs packet interception and
   forwarding to/from the IP address/prefix assigned to the MN, based
   on the internetwork location information, either to the destination
   or to some other network element that knows how to forward the
   packets to their destination.



3. Enhanced Anchoring Models

   FM is distributed over MRs deployed at the edges while AM and LM are
   distributed or centralized. Taking into consideration the deployment
   of the mobility management functions, four cases of the function
   deployment for anchor switching are given.

3.1. Case 1: Distributed AM, LM, and FM functions (All-in-One)

             -------------  anchor switching req. -------------
            |    (MR)     |  -----------------+  |    (MR)     |
            |AR + LM + FM |  +-----------------  |AR + LM + FM |
             -------------  anchor switching res. -------------
                +  |
                |  |
   (indication) |  | (Response to the indication)
                |  +
               ------
              |  MN  |
               ------


               Figure 1 Distributed AM, LM, and FM functions

   In this case, LM and FM functions are co-located at MRs. When an MN
   is attached at an MR, the MR should be able to assign IP address or
   prefix on its address pool by AR and manage binding cache associated
   with the assigned IP prefix by LM. When anchor switching is needed
   (for load-balancing or optimal routing after the MN's handover), the
   MR (left) initiates an anchor switching procedure, sending anchor
   switching request message including the binding context associated
   with the MN's flow to another MR (right) as shown in Figure 1. If
   the target MR is available to accept the anchor switching request,
   it sends back anchor switching response message to the request MR.
   Employed signaling message can be implemented through extension of
   existing mobility signaling message such as Proxy Binding Update
   (PBU) and Proxy Binding Acknowledgment (PBA) messages in PMIPv6.

   In this case, each MR should be involved in negotiation for anchor
   switching and have a target MR selection algorithm, which leads to
   more signaling and complex processing.

3.2. Case 2: Distributed LM and FM functions with centralized AF


                               -----------
                              |     AF    |

     (mobility signaling   /                 \  (mobility signaling
       or DHCP to get    /                     \   or DHCP to get
       an IP address)  /                         \   an IP address)
                     /                             \
                   +                                 +
             -------------  anchor switching req. -------------
            |    (MR)     |  -----------------+  |    (MR)     |
            |  LM  +  FM  |  +-----------------  |  LM  +  FM  |
             -------------  anchor switching res. -------------
                +  |
                |  |
   (indication) |  | (Response to the indication)
                |  +

              |  MN  |
               ------


        Figure 2 Distributed LM and FM functions with centralized AF

   In this case, LM and FM functions are co-located at MRs while AF is
   deployed in the form of centralization. When an MN is attached at an
   MR, the MR needs to get an IP address or prefix from the AF. For
   this operation, an extended binding update signaling from IP
   mobility protocols or DHCP can be used. The rest of functions and
   operations follow the same procedures described in Case 1.

                  ------

             Figure 3 Distributed AF and FM with centralized LM

   In this case, MRs have the AF and FM functions. There is a dedicated
   and centralized network entity working as a controller for anchor
   switching, as well as being in charge of IP or prefix assignment and
   management of binding cache entry.

   When an MN enters a distributed mobility management domain, it gets
   a new IP or prefix from an AF. The assigned IP or prefix is
   delivered to the requested MR, and the MR then applies the received
   IP or prefix to the forwarding table in the FM.

   When anchor switching is needed, there are no signaling interactions
   between the former MR and new MR but between the related MRs and
   controller, since the controller is in charge of the anchor
   switching operation. As shown in Figure 3, the requesting MR (left)
   sends an anchor switching request message, defined in [RFC5213],
   including the binding context associated with the MN to controller.
   The controller then checks an available MR (or based on a designated
   MR received from the requesting MR), and delivers the binding
   context to an MR (right). The MR (right) applies the forwarding rule
   between the MRs by sending the anchor switching request message and
   sends back the anchor switching response message through the reverse
   path.

   For smooth path transition during the anchor switching, a transient
   tunneling could be established between the two MRs until a new
   routing path is established. When the routing path is made, the
   forwarding table applied in the previous MR is deleted.

   Such deployment makes MRs lightweight for anchor switching,
   controlled by a central entity managing forwarding state and
   monitoring load status at each MR.

3.4. Case 4: Distributed FM function with centralized AF and LM

                ---------       ----------------
               |    AF   |     | LM (Controller)|
                ---------     ----------------
                   +       + ++        ++
          mobility |        //         || anchor switching
         signaling |       // \        ||  req./res.
          or DHCP  +      ++   +       ++
                ----------        ----------
               |  FM (MR)|       |  FM (MR) |
                ----------        ----------
                   +  |
                   |  |
      (indication) |  | (Response to the indication)
                   |  +
                  ------
                 |  MN  |
                  ------

             Figure 4 Distributed FM with centralized AF and LM

   In this case, MRs have the forwarding path management function only.
   AF and LM are deployed in a centralized form.

   When an MN enters a distributed mobility management domain, it gets
   a new IP or prefix from the AF, which can be determined based on
   attached location of the MR. The assigned IP or prefix is delivered
   to the requested MR, and the MR then applies the received IP or
   prefix to the forwarding table in FM. When anchor switching is
   needed, it follows the same procedures described in case 3.
