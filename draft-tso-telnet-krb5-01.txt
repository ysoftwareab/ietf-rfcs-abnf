      remote side of the connection.  The first octet of the
      <authentication-type-pair> value is KERBEROS_V5, to indicate that
      Version 5 of Kerberos is being used.  The Kerberos V5
      authenticator in the KRB_AP_REQ message must contain a Kerberos V5
      checksum of the two-byte authentication type pair.  This checksum
      must be verified by the server to assure that the authentication
      type pair was correctly negotiated.  The Kerberos V5 authenticator
      must also include the optional subkey field, which shall be filled
      in with a randomly chosen key.  This key shall be used for
      encryption purposes if encryption is negotiated, and shall be
      assigned keyid 0 for the purposes of the telnet encryption option;
      if the subkey is not filled in, then the ticket session key will
      be used instead.

   IAC SB AUTHENTICATION REPLY <authentication-type-pair> ACCEPT IAC SE

      This command indicates that the authentication was successful.

      If the AUTH_HOW_MUTUAL bit is set in the second octet of the
      authentication-type-pair, the RESPONSE command must be sent before
      the ACCEPT command is sent.

   IAC SB AUTHENTICATION REPLY <authentication-type-pair> REJECT
   <optional reason for rejection> IAC SE

      This command indicates that the authentication was not successful,
      and if there is any more data in the sub-option, it is an ASCII
      text message of the reason for the rejection.

   IAC SB AUTHENTICATION REPLY <authentication-type-pair> RESPONSE
   <KRB_AP_REP message> IAC SE

      This command is used to perform mutual authentication.  It is only
      used when the AUTH_HOW_MUTUAL bit is set in the second octet of
      the authentication-type-pair.  After an AUTH command is verified,
      a RESPONSE command is sent which contains a Kerberos V5 KRB_AP_REP
      message to perform the mutual authentication.

   IAC SB AUTHENTICATION <authentication-type-pair> FORWARD <KRB_CRED
   message> IAC SE

      This command is used to forward kerberos credentials for use by
      the remote session.  The credentials are passed as a Kerberos V5
      KRB_CRED message which includes, among other things, the forwarded
      Kerberos ticket and a session key associated with the ticket. Part
      of the KRB_CRED message is encrypted in the key previously
      exchanged for the telnet session by the AUTH suboption.

   IAC SB AUTHENTICATION <authentication-type-pair> FORWARD_ACCEPT IAC
   SE

      This command indicates that the credential forwarding was
      successful.

   IAC SB AUTHENTICATION <authentication-type-pair> FORWARD_REJECT
   <optional reason for rejection> IAC SE

      This command indicates that the credential forwarding was not
      successful, and if there is any more data in the sub-option, it is
      an ASCII text message of the reason for the rejection.


3.  Implementation Rules

   If the second octet of the authentication-type-pair has the AUTH_WHO
   bit set to AUTH_CLIENT_TO_SERVER, then the client sends the initial
   AUTH command, and the server responds with either ACCEPT or REJECT.
   In addition, if the AUTH_HOW bit is set to AUTH_HOW_MUTUAL, the
   server will send a RESPONSE before it sends the ACCEPT.

   If the second octet of the authentication-type-pair has the AUTH_WHO
   bit set to AUTH_SERVER_TO_CLIENT, then the server sends the initial
   AUTH command, and the client responds with either ACCEPT or REJECT.
   In addition, if the AUTH_HOW bit is set to AUTH_HOW_MUTUAL, the
   client will send a RESPONSE before it sends the ACCEPT.

   The Kerberos principal used by the server will generally be of the
   form "host/<hostname>@realm".  That is, the first component of the
   Kerberos principal is "host"; the second component is the fully
   qualified lower-case hostname of the server; and the realm is the
   Kerberos realm to which the server belongs.

   Any Telnet IAC characters that occur in the KRB_AP_REQ or KRB_AP_REP
   messages, the KRB_CRED structure, or the optional rejection text
   string must be doubled as specified in [2].  Otherwise the following
   byte might be mis-interpreted as a Telnet command.

4.  Examples

   User "joe" may wish to log in as user "pete" on machine "foo".  If
   "pete" has set things up on "foo" to allow "joe" access to his
   account, then the client would send IAC SB AUTHENTICATION NAME "pete"
   IAC SE IAC SB AUTHENTICATION IS KERBEROS_V5 AUTH <KRB_AP_REQ_MESSAGE>
   IAC SE

   The server would then authenticate the user as "joe" from the
   KRB_AP_REQ_MESSAGE, and if the KRB_AP_REQ_MESSAGE was accepted by
   Kerberos, and if "pete" has allowed "joe" to use his account, the
   server would then continue the authentication sequence by sending a
   RESPONSE (to do mutual authentication, if it was requested) followed
   by the ACCEPT.

   If forwarding has been requested, the client then sends IAC SB

   succeeds in reading the forwarded credentials, the server sends
   FORWARD_ACCEPT else, a FORWARD_REJECT is sent back.

5. Security Considerations

   The selection of the random session key in the Kerberos V5 authenti-
   cator is critical, since this key will be used for encrypting the
   telnet data stream if encryption is enabled.  It is strongly advised
   that the random key selection be done using cryptographic techniques
   that involve the Kerberos ticket's session key.  For example, using
   the current time, encrypting it with the ticket session key, and then
   correcting for key parity is a strong way to generate a subsession
   key, since the ticket session key is assumed to be never disclosed to
   an attacker.

   Care should be taken before forwarding a user's Kerberos credentials
   to the remote server.  If the remote server is not trustworthy, this
   could result in the user's credentials being compromised.  Hence, the
   user interface should not forward credentials by default; it would be
   far safer to either require the user to explicitly request creden-
   tials forwarding for each connection, or to have a trusted list of
   hosts for which credentials forwarding is enabled, but to not enable
   credentials forwarding by default for all machines.
