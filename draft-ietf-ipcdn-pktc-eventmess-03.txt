   Abstract 
     
      This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)  
      for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. 
      In particular, it provides a common data and format definition for  
      events and specifies by what means events are transmitted for  
      PacketCable/IPCablecom compliant Multimedia Terminal Adapter devices. 
      This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the 
      SNMP SMIv2 [5][6][7].  The set of objects are consistent with the 
      SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards.

1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Overview 
      
   This MIB provides a set of objects required for the management of 
   PacketCable/IPCablecom compliant MultiMedia Terminal Adapter (MTA) devices. The  
   mechanisms to control the event reporting are defined in this document.  
      
3.1.  Structure of the MIB 
      
   This MIB is structured as six groups: 
      
      o    Management information that controls the event reporting  
           (pktcDevEventControl). 
      
      o    Management information that configures the reporting of the various  
           programmable events (pktcDevEventConfig). 
      
      o    Management information that configures the event throttling control       
           (pktcDevEventThrottle). 
      
      o    Management information that configures that allows the retrieval of events via  
           SNMP (pktcDevEventLocal). 
      
      o    Management information that specifies the information sent in traps and        
           informs (pktcDevEventNotify). 
      
      o    Management information that defines the trap and inform messages      
           (pktcDevEventNotification). 
      
      Tables within each of these groups group objects functionally. 
      
   3.1.1.  pktcDevEventControl 
      
      The objects in the pkctDevEventControl group control to where the syslog messages  
      will be send to and the clearing of the event log. 
      
      pkctDevEvControl -
                   - this object is used to reset the event log and restore the  
      default event reporting settings.  
                                                             
      pkctDevEvSyslogAddressType -
                            - the type of internet address for the syslog server, it  
      is not necessary to support all types. 
      
      pktcDevEvSyslogAddress -
                        - the IP-address of the syslog server, this can also be a  
      FQDN, although the use of FQDN is discouraged.

      pkctDevEvSyslogUdpPort -
                        - this object specifies the UDP-port to which the syslog  
      messages need to be send. 
        
      
   3.1.2.  pktcDevEventConfig 
      
      pktcDevEvProgrammableTable - This table configures the reporting of various  
      programmable events. By the use of this table it is possible to configure specific  
      events to have a specific priority or report a specific event message. Additionaly  
      the way of reporting (e.g. local, syslog, .. ) can be controlled. 
      
      pktcDevEvFixedTable - This table configures the reporting of fixed events. By the 
      use of this table it is possible to configure specific events to have a specific      
      priority or report a specific event message. Additionaly the way of reporting (e.g.  
      local, syslog, .. ) can be controlled. 
      
   3.1.3.  pktcDevEventThrottle 
    
      This group of objects controls the throttling of reporting events.  
      
   3.1.4.  pktcDevEventLocal 
      
      pktcDevEventTable -
                    - this tables contains a log of network and device events that  
      can be retrieved by SNMP. The table can be cleared by using pkctDevEvControl.  
      
   3.1.5   pktcDevEventNotify 
      
      This group specifies the event data for Traps and Informs. 
      
   3.1.6   pktcDevEvNotification 
       
      The structure for the traps and informs is defined in this group.

8. Security Considerations 

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   pktcDevEventControl: This table controls to where events will be sent. 
                        Network operations can be impacted if insufficient 
	                    security is provided
		 
   pktcDevEventConfig:  This table configures the type of events that will be 
                        reported, as such it has an influence on the number of 
                        messages that will be transmitted on the network. 
                        If not configured properly the network might
		                get flooded with messages.

   pktcDevEventThrottle: This table controls the rate at which events can be 
                         generated, if not configured properly, the network 
		                 load caused by event event messaging might severely 
		                 impact network performance.

         
   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects
   with a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control even GET access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   pktcDevEventLocal: This table contains the log of event messages. Read 
                      access to this table might reveal some specific 
	                  information that should be kept confidential.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network
   is allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the
   objects in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features
   as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms
   (for authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
   RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to
   an instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give
   access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have
   legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
