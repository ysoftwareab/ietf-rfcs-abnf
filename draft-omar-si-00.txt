RFC                 Satellite Internet (SI)           June 13, 2017


1.  Introduction


    - Internet covers the solid areas of the earth, where people living in
      different places can have access to the Internet through different
      technologies (such as 802.3 Ethernet, 802.11 Wi-Fi, and mobile internet).
    
    - When people travels overseas or in planes, they don't have access to
      the Internet through any available technology due to their long mobility
      distances.
    
    - Satellite Internet (SI) is a new technology that will allow travelers
      travelling overseas or in-planes to gain access to the Internet.
    
    - Satellite Internet (SI) with collaboration with the Global Positioning
      System (GPS) will allow only hosts located in seas (Longitude, Latitude,
      and Time in a blue area) and planes (Longitude, Latitude, altitude and Time
      in an area within a specified height ranges) to get access to the Internet
      through the SI network.
    
    - The determination of the host position (Longitude, Latitude, Altitude, and Time)
      will determine whether that host will be allowed to access the Satellite Internet
      (SI) or not.
    
    - Once the host is located within the seas areas or over a height range (altitude
      range) that is determined for the flying planes, this host will get access to
      the SI network and access the Internet with limited data for every host.

2.  Satellite Internet (SI)


   - SI works by using a space network of satellites that surrounds the whole earth,
     connected to each others using fiber optic cables, and have coverage areas that
     covers the whole earth without frequency interference as shown in the following
     figure:

   - Each satellite covers a specific area of the earth. 
   - Each satellite holds routers connected to other routers on other satellites using
     fiber optic cables.

   Note:  - Satellite coverage areas can be interferred and hosts connecting to SI has
            to choose the nearest satellite with has the better signal strength.

   - Each satellite is connected to an earth station which is connected to the Internet
     core network on earth.
