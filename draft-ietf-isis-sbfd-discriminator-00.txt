1.  Introduction

   [S-BFD] defines a simplified mechanism to use Bidirectional
   Forwarding Detection (BFD)[RFC5880].  This mechanism depends on
   network nodes knowing the BFD discriminators which each node in the
   network has reserved for this purpose.  Use of the Intermediate
   System to Intermediate System (IS-IS)[IS-IS] protocol is one possible
   means of advertising these discriminators.

2.  Encoding Format

   The IS-IS Router CAPABILITY TLV as defined in [RFC4971] will be used
   to advertise S-BFD discriminators.  A new sub-TLV is defined as
   described below.  S-BFD Discriminators sub-TLVs are formatted as
   specified in [RFC5305].

                 | Type (to be assigned by     |     1
                 | IANA - suggested value 19)  |
                 +-----------------------------+

                 +-----------------------------+


   Inclusion of the S-BFD Discriminators sub-TLV in a Router Capability
   TLV is optional.  Multiple S-BFD Discriminators sub-TLVs MAY be
   advertised by an IS.  When multiple S-BFD discriminators are
   advertised how a given discriminator is mapped to a specific use case
   is out of scope for this document.

   S-BFD discriminator advertisements MAY be flooded within an area or
   throughout the domain using the procedures specified in [RFC4971].

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires the definition of a new sub-TLV in the Sub-
   TLVs for TLV 242 registry.  The value written below is a suggested
   value subject to assignment by IANA.

    Value  Description
    ----  ---------------------
     19    S-BFD Discriminators


4.  Security Considerations

   Security concerns for IS-IS are addressed in [IS-IS], [RFC5304], and
   [RFC5310].  Introduction of the S-BFD Discriminators sub-TLV
   introduces no new security risks for IS-IS.

   Advertisement of the S-BFD discriminators does make it possible for
   attackers to initiate S-BFD sessions using the advertised
   information.  The vulnerabilities this poses and how to mitigate them
   are discussed in the Security Considerations section of [S-BFD].

5.  Acknowledgements

   The authors wish to thank Sam Aldrin, Manav Bhatia, and Carlos
   Pignataro for input essential to defining the needed functionality.
