Abstract

   This document defines a set of Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   attributes that allow SDP to provides tightly controlled membership
   information. Some multimedia conferencing applications may require
   strict membership control policies and an application user may want
   to know the membership characteristics such as who are listening to
   the conference or who has an authority to own the session and to
   speak in the session. Reliable multicast protocols also need the
   precise group information for reliability control.

   This document describes the membership management models and defines
   extending attributes of SDP for supporting the tight coordination of
   group membership control.

1. Introduction

   Session Description Protocol (SDP) [SDP] is designed to convey
   multimedia conference relevant information to recipients. It provides
   general description for all multimedia sessions.

   However, it still does not provide specific membership information
   which is necessary for some multicast sessions. Many scenarios can be
   examples requiring membership information. In a multicast conference,
   group organizer may want to designate who should be mandatory
   participants and how many number of participants are able to be
   handled when it create a session. In a closed group where only
   specific member are invited, a prospective group participant may want
   to know specific group information as well as general information
   before session joining. Another case is that a contents provider in a
   cyber education session wants to open the class when it satisfies the
   minimum required number of participants or to know who is registering
   the class.

   These information can carry in a session description when a session
   creates. This document is based upon a set of requirements to deliver
   tight controlled membership information. We describe membership model
   and the corresponding features in SDP by defining a set of new SDP
   attributes that satisfy the requirements of tight membership control.


2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]

3. Considerations of membership information

   This section informally outlines categories for membership model of
   multiparty multimedia session. A certain model assumed for the
   membership of a session. In terms of membership management,
   multiparty multimedia session can be classified as following:

     * open model: everyone can join a session without restriction

     * closed model: only pre-determined, pre-announced, or end systems
                     determined during runtime can join a session

     * static model: the group of participants does not change during
                     runtime of the session.

     * dynamic model: the group of participants might change during
                     runtime of the session.

     * loose model: a loose group is one for which it is not possible
                    to determine the group membership

     * tight model: a tight group can provide individual information
                    of member, which can be fully controlled. There may
                    be two sub-categories by participants' knowledge of
                    the membership information:

          + completely-tight: every member may know the individual name
                              or email address, or et al.

          + partially-tight: a subset of members may know the individual
                             name or address of every member (e.g. in a
                             conference, a chairman and one or more
                             speakers can acquire the individual
   details)

   In the remaining part of this document, the following combinations
   can be described for group communications:

      - open and loose
      - open and tight
      - closed, static and tight
      - closed, dynamic, and tight

   Every multicast application may be classified into one of the above
   membership classes. The traditional IP Multicast sessions have the
   open and loose properties, while disseminating applications such as
   multicast FTP service or a push service may have the closed, dynamic
   and tight properties.

   When a software vendor wants to upgrade its product automatically,
   the product may be defined in having the closed, static and tight
   ones. Since system and network resources are required for a reliable
   data transport service, the closed and tight characteristics fit for
   the service. The open and tight or loose properties may fit for the
   unreliable transport service only. For those closed and tight
   membership applications, tight membership control MUST be performed
   and a management framework can be developed for appropriate
   functions.

   We can especially concentrate on "open and tight", "closed, static
   and tight", and "closed, dynamic, and tight" groups for membership
   management.


4. New attributes for membership description in SDP

   For tight controlled membership, SDP MUST be extended to specify
   additional featuers: registration, retrieval and membership
   characteristics. These may be operation factors for tight management
   of membership.


4.1 Extension of Session level attribute

      * o= <username><session id><network type><address type><address>

   "o=" field structure is identical with that of RFC2327. But the
   semantic definition may be different according to the message types:
   We define "create", "query", and "enroll" types, and for "create"
   smtype, the definition is exactly same with RFC2327, while for
   "query" and "enroll" types, it contains message sender's username and
   address in <username> and <address>.


      * a=sowner:<owner id>/<email address>/<phone number>/<fax number>

   This attibute specifies the contact information of owner in addition
   to origin field. <owner id> will be the same with <username> in the
   origin field. The other conventional formats are identical with
   RFC2327.


      * a=sname:<session name>/<session id>

   <session name>and <session id> identifies a unique session described
   in [SDP]. A "create" message MUST specify both fields, but a "query"
   or "enroll" can specify either one or both.



ekim             draft-ekim-mmusic-sdp-membership-00.txt        [Page 4]





INTERNET-DRAFT             Expires: April 2002           November 2001


      * a=smtype:<message type>
        a=smtype:<message type>/<error code>

   This attribute specifies the message types for membership management.
   <message type> holds "create", "query", "enroll", "okcreate",
   "okquery", and "okenroll". "create"is used for registration of a
   session description. "okcreate" is used for response of "create".
   When smtype is "create", it can specify detail membership policy with
   extending attributes like "a=agipolicy", "a=max/min", and
   "a=mandatory"(see section 4.3). "query" is used for retrieval of a
   session description, and "okquery" is used for corresponding response
   of it. When smtype is "query", "a=sname" attributes might be followed
   in order to clarify which session information is needed. In a "closed
   and tight" model anyone interested in a session MUST enroll by
   "enroll" message and SHOULD get corresponding "okenroll" message for
   a successful response.

   <error code> can report an unsuccessful result. The possible codes
   defined are described below:

      - Client error 1xx
         "100" - Bad request
                 The request cannot be understood due to malformed
                 syntax.
         "101" - Unauthorized
                 It will be used for user authentication. An example
                 of this is when the session convey "k=" field with
                 encryption key[SDP],
                 any request by a client can be checked with the key
                 field, and be verified.
         "102" - Forbidden
                 If a sender holds a "forbidden" list of clients, it
                 can be used.
         "103" - Not found
                 There is no requested session.
         "104" - Request Timeout
                 When the requested session is no longer available,
                 or if a session does not provide "late join",
                 late joiner will get this error code.

      - Sever error 2xx
         "200" - Service unavailable
                 Server is unable to handle any request of session
                 creation or session requests due to a temporary
                 overloading. This is a temporary condition which will
                 get better after some delay.
         "201" - Internal server error
                 Server encounters an unexpected error. This will not

                 be overcome for a short period of delay.


4.2 Media-level attributes

      * m=<media><port><transport><fmt list>

   The definition of "m=" field is the same with that of RFC2327.
   However, <transport> sub-field MUST be extended for various multicast
   transport protocols, especially for reliable multicast. Currently,
   RTP/AVP and UDP are supported, and additional values are below:

         "rmtp" for RMTP/RMTP-II [RMTP_II];
         "tram" for TRAM[TRAM];
         "lct" for LCT[LCT];
         "srm" for SRM [SRM];
         "ectp" for ECTP [ECTP];

   "a=<transport>:<protocol dependent parameters>/..." attribute MAY
   follow this filed to specify each characteristics for the above
   transport protocols.


   * a=<transport>:<protocol dependent parameters>/...

      <protocol dependent parameter> can be defined by each protocols.


4.3  Attributes for membership information

      * a=agipolicy:<policy>
        a=agipolicy:<policy>/<condition>

   A session owner can define this attribute when it creates a session.
   Active Group Integrity(AGI) means a set of conditions concerning an
   active group. <policy> filed holds "hard" or "soft". In "hard"
   policy, the transport connection MUST be terminated when the AGI is
   violated. In "soft" policy, it MUST be suspended when the AGI is
   violated and it will be restored if the AGI is recovered.

   <condition> defines "unity" or "quorum", and "complete" or "partial".
   "unity" specifies that all of enrolled group members are required to
   be present in the active group. "quorum" implies that the majority of
   group members are required to be present. In "unity", every other AGI
   condition such as "a=max", "a=min", and "a=mandatory" is invalid.
   "complete" implies that all of active member can know the whole
   session information including membership information (completely
   tight model),  whereas "partial" implies that only authorized users



ekim             draft-ekim-mmusic-sdp-membership-00.txt        [Page 6]





INTERNET-DRAFT             Expires: April 2002           November 2001


   can do it (partially tight model). In "partial" case, only users
   mentioned in "a=mandatory" attributes can request the information.


      * a=max:<maximum number>

   This attributes specifies maximum number of participants that can be
   allowed in an active group. The value of <maximum number> is
   represented as a numeric number like "a=max:100".


      * a=min:<minimum number>

   This attributes specifies minimum number of participants that can be
   allowed in an active group. The value of <minimum number> is
   represented as a numeric number like "a=min:3".


      * a=token:<token number>

   This attribute specifies maximum number of participants that can be
   allowed to concurrently transmit data. The value of <token number> is
   represented as a numeric number like "a=token number:3".


      * a=mandatory:<user id>/<email address>/<phone number>/<fax
   number>

   This attribute specifies the selected group members required to be
   present in an active group. The sub-field is identical with
   "a=sowner" attribute. A series of "a=mandatory" can be specified as
   following examples. <user id> is the same with <username> in origin
   field of RFC2327.

        a=mandatory:eunah/Eunsook Kim <eunah@etri.re.kr>/
                     +82-42-860-6124/ /
        a=mandatory:sgkang/Shin Gak Kang <sgkang@etri.re.kr>/
                     +82-42-860-6117/+82-42-861-5404

   In order to identify mandatory users, a key should be exchanged in an
   out-of-band mechanism.


5. Examples

   This section provides some examples of use of membership attributes.

   First, when a conference registrar or conference initiator create a

INTERNET-DRAFT             Expires: April 2002           November 2001


   session at a well-known management server, it uses smtype of "create"
   and the server may response with "okcreate". In this case, it MAY
   contain ownership and session characteristics. An example is as
   following:

        v=0
        o=eunah 2890844526 2890842807 IN IP4 129.254.165.100
        s=SDP extensions
        i= Extensions of SDP for tight membership management
        e=eunah@etri.re.kr
        p=+82-42-860-6124
        t=2873397496 2873404696
        a=charset:ISO-8859-1
        a=smtype:create
        a= sname:sdp-extensions/2890844526
        a=sowner:eunah/eunah@etri.re.kr (Eunsook Kim)/ /
        a=agipolicy:hard/quorum
        a=max:100
        a=min:3
        a=token:2
        a=mandatory:eunah/Eunsook Kim <eunah@etri.re.kr>/ /
        a=mandatory:sgkang/Shin Gak Kang <sgkang@etri.re.kr>/ /
        m=audio 49170 rtp 0
        m=video 51372 lct 31
        m=application 32416 srm wb
        a=orient:portrait
        a=precedence:3

   When the server get this messages it can response with "okcreate" as
   following:
        v=0
        a=smtype:okcreate
        a=sname:sdp-extensions/2890844526
        c= IN IP4 224.2.1.1/127
        m=audio 50000 rtp 0
        m=video 50001 lct 31
        m=application 50002 srm wb


   In a closed group, when a brief information including session name or
   group key is announced by out-of-band method such as email, a
   prospective user can request detail session description. It is
   notified by smtype, "query".

   For example,
        v=0
        o=sjkoh * 2846923847 IN IP4 203.251.192.125
        a=smtype:query



ekim             draft-ekim-mmusic-sdp-membership-00.txt        [Page 8]





INTERNET-DRAFT             Expires: April 2002           November 2001


        a=sname:sdp-extensions

   The responding "okquery" gives the whole session description. An
   example is as following:

        v=0
        o=eunah 2890844526 2890842807 IN IP4 129.254.165.100
        s=SDP extensions
        i= Extensions of SDP for tight membership management
        e=eunah@etri.re.kr
        p=+82-42-860-6124
        c=IN IP4 224.2.1.1/127
        a=charset:ISO-8859-1
        a=smtype:okquery
        a= sname:sdp-extensions/2890844526
        a=sowner:eunah/eunah@etri.re.kr (Eunsook Kim)/ /
        a=agipolicy:hard/quorum
        a=max:100
        a=min:3
        a=token:2
        a=mandatory:eunah/Eunsook Kim <eunah@etri.re.kr>/ /
        a=mandatory:sgkang/Shin Gak Kang <sgkang@etri.re.kr>/ /
        m=audio 50000 rtp 0
        m=video 50001 lct 31
        m=application 50002 srm wb
        a=orient:portrait
        a=precedence:3

   Another example is that a prospective user sends "enroll" message to
   the server for registration. In a completely tight session, a server
   should maintain user information of every user from this message.

   An example of "enroll" can hold following attributes:

        v=0
        o=sjkoh 2890844526 2890832208 IN IP4 134.188.40.100
        a=smtype:enroll
        a=sname:sdp-extensions/2890844526
        a=sowner:eunah/eunah@etri.re.kr (Eunsook Kim) / /
        m=audio 50000 rtp 0
        m=video 50001 lct 31
        m=application 50002 srm wb

   The corresponding "okenroll" can be used as following:
        v=0
        o=sjkoh 2890844526 2890832208 IN IP4 134.188.40.100
        a=smtype:okenroll
        a=sname:sdp-extensions/2890844526

6. Interoperability with the other protocols
      [TBD]


7. Security Considerations

   This section has the same position with SDP[SDP], but it may need
   stronger security concerns because it is focused on closed or tight
   sessions.

   The detail considerations for these sessions will be provided later.
