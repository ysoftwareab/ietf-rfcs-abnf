Internet Draft     Fibre-Channel Domain Management MIB      January 2004


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects for information related
   to a Fibre Channel network's Domain Management.

1.1.  Change Log

   (This section to be deleted before final publication.)

   This section to be maintained as a record of changes between interim
   versions.

1.1.1.  First version

   Published in January 2004


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3.  Short Overview of Fibre Channel

   The Fibre Channel (FC) is logically a bidirectional point-to-point
   serial data channel, structured for high performance capability.  The
   Fibre Channel provides a general transport vehicle for higher level
   protocols such as Intelligent Peripheral Interface (IPI) and Small
   Computer System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-Performance
   Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet Protocol), IEEE
   802.2, and others.

Internet Draft     Fibre-Channel Domain Management MIB      January 2004


   Physically, Fibre Channel is an interconnection of multiple
   communication points, called N_Ports, interconnected either by a
   switching network, called a Fabric, or by a point-to-point link.  A
   Fibre Channel "node" consists of one or more N_Ports.  A Fabric may
   consist of multiple Interconnect Elements, some of which are
   switches.  An N_Port connects to the Fabric via a port on a switch
   called an F_Port.  When multiple FC nodes are connected to a single
   port on a switch via an "Arbitrated Loop" topology, the switch port
   is called an FL_Port, and the nodes' ports are called NL_Ports.  The
   term Nx_Port is used to refer to either an N_Port or an NL_Port.  The
   term Fx_Port is used to refer to either an F_Port or an FL_Port.  A
   switch port, which is interconnected to another switch port via an
   Inter Element Link (IEL), is called an E_Port.  A B_Port connects a
   bridge device with an E_Port on a switch; a B_Port provides a subset
   of E_Port functionality.

   Many Fibre Channel components, including the fabric, each node, and
   most ports, have globally-unique names.  These globally-unique names
   are typically formatted as World Wide Names (WWNs).  More information
   on WWNs can be found in [FC-FS].  WWNs are expected to be persistent
   across agent and unit resets.

   Fibre Channel the frame's source and destination ports.  Each FC port
   has both an address identifier and a WWN.  When a fabric is in use,
   the FC address identifiers are dynamic and are assigned by a switch.
   Each octet of a 24-bit address represents a level in an address
   hierarchy, with a Domain_ID being the highest level of the hierarchy.

   Each Switch in a Fabric is assigned one (or more) unique Domain_IDs
   using a two-step process.  First, one switch, called Principal
   Switch, is selected from the switches of a Fabric.  Then, the
   Principal Switch assigns Domain_IDs to the other switches of the
   Fabric.  Address assignment within a Domain is performed by the
   switch to which that Domain_ID is granted.


4.  Relationship to Other MIBs

   The first standardized MIB for Fibre Channel [RFC2837] was focussed
   on Fibre Channel switches.  It is being replaced by the more generic
   Fibre Channel Management MIB [FC-MGMT] which defines basic
   information for Fibre Channel hosts and switches, including
   extensions to the standard IF-MIB for Fibre Channel interfaces.

   This MIB extends beyond [FC-MGMT] to cover the functionality, in

Internet Draft     Fibre-Channel Domain Management MIB      January 2004


   Fibre Channel switches, which is used to manage fabric configuration,
   domains, and addresses within a domain.

   This document also contains a MIB module, T11-TC-MIB, to define
   Textual Conventions useful for multiple MIBs defined by T11, which
   could be moved to its own document if appropriate.

5.  MIB Overview

   This MIB contains five MIB groups, as follows.

5.1.  The t11DmGroup group

   This group contains basic information about the Domain management
   functionality within a switch.

5.2.  The t11DmDatabaseGroup group

   This group contains information about which switches are assigned to
   which domains.

5.3.  The t11DmAreaGroup group

   This group contains information about which port-ids have been
   assigned within the areas of the local domain.

5.4.  The t11DmCacheGroup group

   This group contains information about all the FC address identifier
   assignments which have been recently released.  This cache is kept to
   provide best effort (short-term) re-assignment of the same FC address
   identifiers.

5.5.  The t11DmNotificationGroup group

   This group contains notifications of significant events concerning
   the domain management functionality within a switch.

           Virtual Fabric, or zero if no Domain_ID has been
           configured.  The meaning of this object depends on
           t11DmConfigDomainIdType object.

           If t11DmConfigDomainIdType is 'preferred', then domain ID
           configured is called 'preferred Domain_ID'. The valid
           values are between 0 and 239. In a situation where
           this domain could not be assigned, any other domain ID
           would be acceptable. The value '0' means any domain ID.

           If t11DmConfigDomainIdType is 'static', then domain ID is
           called 'static Domain_ID' and valid values are between
           1 and 239. In a situation where this domain was
           non-zero but could not be assigned, no other domain ID
           would be acceptable.

           If the Domain Manager is enabled on the Virtual Fabric,
           then an RDI (Request Domain_ID) will be sent requesting
           this Domain_ID. If a Domain_ID is not able to be granted
           in the case of 'preferred', or if a 'static' Domain_ID is
           configured but not able to be granted, then it is an error
           condition.  When this error occurs, the E_Ports on that
           Virtual Fabric will be isolated and administrator will be
           informed via a 't11DmDomainIdNotAssigned' notification.

           If the domain manager is not enabled, then the static
           Domain_ID is assumed to be granted, if it has been
           configured (to a valid number).

           If either of the domain IDs are not configured with a
           non-zero value on this Virtual Fabric and if the domain

           An entry in this table is automatically created when
           an E_Port becomes non-isolated and there is a
           entry in t11DmTable for that Virtual Fabric.

           An entry is deleted automatically from this table if :
           a) the correponding interface becomes non-existent, or
           b) the correponding interface becomes a non-E_Port

           - an entry exists for a non-E_Port or an E_Port which is

             and the corresponding Virtual Fabric has an entry in the
             t11DmTable;
           - an entry is not able to be created (via t11DmIfRowStatus)
             for an interface with default parameters; instead, the
             agent creates/deletes an entry for an interface with
             default parameters according to whether the E_Port is
             up or down.
           - an entry is not able to be created via t11DmIfRowStatus

             an entry in the t11DmTable.
           - deleting an entry via RowStatus when either the
             interface is down and configured with non-default
             values or the interface is up, is equivalent to
             resetting its parameters to their default values.

            A switch might receive or issue a BuildFabric (BF)
            message under the following conditions:
            - A new link causes two disjoint fabrics in a Virtual
              Fabric to merge into one fabric. The sent/received
              message is BF if the Domain_ID lists on the disjoint

            - An upstream principal ISL which connects to Principal
              switch and other switches in a Virtual Fabric fails.
              BF is issued to see if there is an alternative path to
              the Principal Switch, or to select a new Principal
              Switch.
            - A switch asks for a different set of Domain_IDs

11.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write:

        - to be supplied

   Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
   network environments.  For example, the ability to change network
   topology or network speed may afford an attacker the ability to
   obtain better performance at the expense of other network users.  The
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  In particular, these objects provide
   information on ...

        - to be supplied

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementors consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
