       Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) Partial Response
             draft-loffredo-regext-rdap-partial-response-02

Abstract

   The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) does not include
   capabilities to request partial responses.  In fact, according to the
   user authorization, the server can only return full responses.
   Partial responses capability, especially in the case of search
   queries, could bring benefits to both clients and servers.  This
   document describes a RDAP query extension that allows clients to
   specify their preference for obtaining a partial response.

1.  Introduction

   The use of partial response in RESTful API [REST] design is very
   common.  The rationale is quite simple: instead of returning objects
   in API responses with all data fields, only a subset is returned.
   The benefit is obvious: less data transferred over the network mean
   less bandwidth usage, faster server response, less CPU time spent
   both on the server and the client, as well as less memory usage on
   the client.

   Several leading APIs providers (e.g.  LinkedIn [LINKEDIN], Facebook
   [FACEBOOK], Google [GOOGLE]) implement the partial response feature
   by providing an optional query parameter by which users require the
   fields they wish to receive.  Partial response is also considered a
   leading principle by many best practices guidelines in REST APIs
   implementation ([REST-API1], [REST-API2]) in order to improve
   performance, save on bandwidth and possibly accelerate the overall
   interaction.  In other contexts, for example in digital libraries and
   bibliographic catalogues, servers can provide responses according to
   different element sets (i.e. "brief" to get back a short response and
   "full" to get back the complete response)

   Currently, RDAP does not provide a client with any way to request a
   partial response: the server can only provide the client with the
   full response ([RFC7483]).  Furthermore, servers cannot define the

Internet-Draft            RDAP Partial Response           September 2018


   limits of the results according to partial responses and this causes
   strong inefficiencies.

   The protocol described in this specification extends RDAP search
   capabilities to enable partial responses, by adding a new query
   parameter and using a RESTful web service.  The service is
   implemented using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC7230]
   and the conventions described in RFC 7480 [RFC7480].

   Impact on the current state of RDAP implementation is low.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Approaches to Partial Response Implementation

   Looking at the implementation experiences described above, two
   approaches to the implementation of partial response can be detected:

   o  the client declares explicitly the data fields to get back;

   o  the client declares a name identifying a server pre-defined set of
      data fields.

   The former is more flexible than the latter, because clients can
   specify all the data fields they need.  Anyway, it has some
   drawbacks:

   o  Fields have to be declared according to a given syntax.  This is a
      simple task when the data structure of the object is flat, but it
      is much more difficult when the object has a tree structure like
      the one of a JSON object.  The presence of arrays and deep nested
      objects contribute to complicate both the syntax definition of the
      query and, consequently, the processing phase on the server side.

   o  Clients should perfectly know the returned object to avoid cases
      when the required fields are not compliant with the object data
      structure.

   o  The request of some fields cannot match the user access levels.
      Clients could put unauthorized fields in their requests and
      servers should define a strategy for providing a response: to
      return always an error response or to return a response ignoring
      the unauthorized fields.

Internet-Draft            RDAP Partial Response           September 2018


   In addition to those listed above, RDAP responses raise some specific
   issues:

   o  Most of the relevant information of the entity object is included
      in the jCard but such information cannot be easily selected
      because it is split into the items of a jagged array.

   o  RDAP responses contain some properties providing service
      information (e.g. rdapConformance, links, notices, remarks, etc.)
      which are not normally selected but they are just as important.
      They could be returned anyway but, in this case, the server would
      provide unrequested data.

   As an example compliant to the first approach, the Catnap Query
   Language (CQL) [CQL] is a comprehensive expression language that can
   be used to customize the JSON response of a RESTful web service.  The
   practical application of CQL to RDAP responses points out that
   declaring explicitly the output fields would still be acceptable when
   a few fields are requested but it would become very complicated if
   the fields should be more.  In the following, two CQL expressions for
   a search domain query are shown (Figure 1): in the first, only
   objectClassName and ldhName are requested, in the second, the fields
   of a possible WHOIS-like response are listed.


https://example.com/rdap/domains?name=example*.com
        &fields=domainSearchResults(objectClassName,ldhName)

https://example.com/rdap/domains?name=example*.com
        &fields=domainSearchResults(objectClassName,ldhName,unicodeName,
                status,
                events(eventAction,eventDate),
                entities(objectClassName,handle,roles),
                nameservers(objectClassName,ldhName))

      Figure 1: Examples of CQL expressions for a search domain query

   The latter approach seems to facilitate RDAP interoperability.  In
   fact, servers can define some basic field sets which, if known to the
   clients, can increase the probability to get a valid response.  The
   usage of field sets lets the query string be less complex.  In
   addition, the definition of pre-defined sets of fields makes easier
   to establish the results limits.

   Finally, considering that there is not a real need for RDAP users to
   have the maximum flexibility in defining all the possible sets of
   logically connected fields (for example, users interested in domains

   usually need to know the status, the creation date, the expire date
   of each domain), the latter approach is preferred.

3.  RDAP Path Segment Specification

   The new query parameter is an OPTIONAL extension of search path
   segments defined in RFC 7482 [RFC7482].  The query parameter is
   "fieldSet" whose value is a string identifying a server pre-defined
   set of fields (Figure 2).  Values REQUIRED to be implemented are:

   o  id: the server provides only the "objectClassName" field and the
      key field ("handle" for entities, "ldhName" for domains and
      nameservers).  This field set can be used when the client wants to
      obtain a collection of object identifiers (Figure 3);

   o  brief: it contains the fields that can be included in a "short"
      response.  This field set can be used when the client is asking
      for a subset of the full response which gives a basic knowledge of
      each object;

   o  full: it contains all the information the server can provide for a
      particular object.

   Fields belonging to brief and full field sets should be provided
   according to users access levels.  Servers MAY implement additional
   field sets not included in the list above.  Servers SHOULD also
   define a "default" field set.


   https://example.com/rdap/domains?name=example*.com&fieldSet=id

                                 parameter

         "objectClassName": "domain",
         "ldhName": "example2.com"
       },
       ...
     ]
   }

3.1.  Subsetting Metadata

   According to most advanced principles in REST design, collectively
   known as HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)
   ([HATEOAS]), a client entering a REST application through an initial
   URI should use the server-provided links to dynamically discover
   available actions and access the resources it needs.  In this way,
   the client is not requested to have prior knowledge of the service
   and, consequently, to hard code the URIs of different resources.
   This would allow the server to make URI changes as the API evolves
   without breaking the clients.  Definitively, a REST service should be
   self-descriptive as much as possible.

   Therefore, the implementation of the query parameter described in
   this specification recommends servers to provide additional
   information in their responses about the available field sets.  Such
   information is collected in a new data structures named
   "subsetting_metadata" containing the following fields:

   o  "currentFieldSet": the value of fieldSet parameter as specified in
      the query string;

   o  "availableFieldSets": an array of objects each one describing an
      available field set:

      *  "name": the field set name;
      *  "description": a human-readable description of the field set;
      *  "default": whether the field set is applied by default;

Internet-Draft            RDAP Partial Response           September 2018


      *  "links": an array of links as described in RFC 8288 [RFC8288]
         containing the query string that applies the field set.

   Both "currentFieldSet" and "availableFieldSets" are OPTIONAL fields
   of the "subsetting_metadata" structure.  In particular, the
   "currentFieldSet" field is provided when the query string contains a
   valid value for fieldSet parameter, while the "availableFieldSets"
   field SHOULD be provided when the fieldSet parameter is missing in
   the query string or when it is present and the server implements more
   than a field set for the RDAP object.  At least the "name" field is
   REQUIRED in each item of the "availableFieldSets" array while the
   other fields are RECOMMENDED.

3.1.1.  Representing Subsetting Links

   An RDAP server MAY use the "links" array of the "subsetting_metadata"
   section to provide ready-made references [RFC8288] to the available
   field set (Figure 4).  Each link represents a reference to an
   alternate view of the results.

6.  Security Considerations

   Search query typically requires more server resources (such as
   memory, CPU cycles, and network bandwidth) when compared to lookup
   query.  This increases the risk of server resource exhaustion and
   subsequent denial of service due to abuse.  Partial response can
   contribute together with other strategies (e.g. restricting search
   functionality, limiting the rate of search requests, truncating and
   paging results) to mitigate this risk.

   Furthermore, partial response can help RDAP operators to regulate
   access control based on client identification, implemented by HTTP
   basic or digest authentication as described in RFC 7481 [RFC7481] or
   by a federated authentication system
   ([I-D.hollenbeck-regext-rdap-openid]).  In fact, RDAP operators can

Internet-Draft            RDAP Partial Response           September 2018


   follow different, not alternative, approaches to the building of
   responses according to the user access levels:

   o  the list of fields for each set (except "id") can be different
      according to the user access levels.  At present, this is already
      implemented for the full response, but it could be done also for
      the other defined field sets.  In some cases, it might happen that
      brief and full field sets are exactly the same;

   o  some field sets could be available only to some users.  In this
      case, servers could define additional field sets to those
      indicated above ("id", "brief", "full"), making them available
      only to users with specific access levels.

   Servers can also define different results limits according to the
   available field sets, so a more flexible truncation strategy can be
   realized and users can take advantage of a more efficient results
   paging implementation
   ([I-D.loffredo-regext-rdap-sorting-and-paging]).

   Therefore, the new parameter presented in this document provides the
   RDAP operators with a way to implement a secure server without
   penalizing its efficiency.
