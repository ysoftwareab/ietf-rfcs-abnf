  Providing Minimal-Sized Responses to DNS Queries that have QTYPE=ANY
                     draft-ietf-dnsop-refuse-any-05

Abstract

   The Domain Name System (DNS) specifies a query type (QTYPE) "ANY".
   The operator of an authoritative DNS server might choose not to
   respond to such queries for reasons of local policy, motivated by
   security, performance or other reasons.

   The DNS specification does not include specific guidance for the
   behaviour of DNS servers or clients in this situation.  This document
   aims to provide such guidance.

Internet-Draft      Minimal Responses for ANY Queries         March 2018


   The DNS specification [RFC1034] [RFC1035] does not include specific
   guidance for the behaviour of DNS servers or clients in this
   situation.  This document aims to provide such guidance.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology specific to the Domain Name System
   (DNS), descriptions of which can be found in [RFC7719].

   In this document, "ANY Query" refers to a DNS meta-query with
   QTYPE=ANY.  An "ANY Response" is a response to such a query.

   In an exchange of DNS messages between two hosts, this document
   refers to the host sending a DNS request as the initiator, and the
   host sending a DNS response as the responder.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Motivations for Use of ANY Queries

   ANY queries are legitimately used for debugging and checking the
   state of a DNS server for a particular name.

   ANY queries are sometimes used as a attempt to reduce the number of
   queries needed to get information, e.g. to obtain MX, A and AAAA
   RRSets for a mail domain in a single query.  There is no documented
   guidance available for this use case, however, and some
   implementations have been observed not to function as perhaps their
   developers expected.  Implementers that assume that an ANY query will
   ultimately be received by an authoritative server and will fetch all
   existing RRSets, should include a fallback mechanism to use when that
   does not happen.

   ANY queries are frequently used to exploit the amplification
   potential of DNS servers/resolvers using spoofed source addresses and
   UDP transport (see [RFC5358]).  Having the ability to return small
   responses to such queries makes DNS servers less attractive
   amplifiers.

   ANY queries are sometimes used to help mine authoritative-only DNS
   servers for zone data, since they are expected to return all RRSets
   for a particular query name.  If a DNS operator prefers to reduce the
   potential for information leaks, they might choose not to send large
   ANY responses.

Internet-Draft      Minimal Responses for ANY Queries         March 2018


   Some authoritative-only DNS server implementations require additional
   processing in order to send a conventional ANY response, and avoiding
   that processing expense might be desirable.

3.  General Approach

   This proposal provides a mechanism for an authority server to signal
   that conventional ANY queries are not supported for a particular
   QNAME, and to do so in such a way that is both compatible with and
   triggers desirable behaviour by unmodified clients (e.g.  DNS
   resolvers).

   Alternative proposals for dealing with ANY queries have been
   discussed.  One approach proposed using a new RCODE to signal that an
   authoritative server did not answer ANY queries in the standard way.
   This approach was found to have an undesirable effect on both
   resolvers and authoritative-only servers; resolvers receiving an
   unknown RCODE would re-send the same query to all available
   authoritative servers, rather than suppress future such ANY queries
   for the same QNAME.

   This proposal avoids that outcome by returning a non-empty RRSet in
   the ANY response, providing resolvers with something to cache and
   effectively suppressing repeat queries to the same or different
   authority servers.

4.  Behaviour of DNS Responders

   Below are the three different modes of behaviour by DNS responders
   when processing queries with QNAMEs that exist, QCLASS=IN and
   QTYPE=ANY.  Operators/Implementers are free to choose whichever
   mechanism best suits their environment.

   1.  A DNS responder can choose to select one or a larger subset of
       the available RRSets at the QNAME.

   2.  A DNS responder can return a synthesised HINFO resource record.
       See Section 6 for discussion of the use of HINFO.

   3.  Resolver can try to give out the most likely records the
       requester wants.  This is not always possible and the result
       might well be a large response.

   Except as described below in this section, the DNS responder MUST
   follow the standard algorithms when constructing a response.

Internet-Draft      Minimal Responses for ANY Queries         March 2018


4.1.  Answer with a Subset of Available RRSets

   A DNS responder which receives an ANY query MAY decline to provide a
   conventional response, or MAY instead send a response with a single
   RRSet (or a larger subset of available RRSets) in the answer section.

   The RRSets returned in the answer section of the response MAY consist
   of a single RRSet owned by the name specified in the QNAME.  Where
   multiple RRSets exist, the responder SHOULD choose a small subset of
   those avialable to reduce the amplification potential of the
   response.

   If the zone is signed, appropriate RRSIG records MUST be included in
   the answer.

4.2.  Answer with a Synthesised HINFO RRSet

   If there is no CNAME present at the owner name matching the QNAME,
   the resource record returned in the response MAY instead be
   synthesised, in which case a single HINFO resource record SHOULD be
   returned.  The CPU field of the HINFO RDATA SHOULD be set to RFCXXXX
   [note to RFC Editor, replace with RFC number assigned to this
   document].  The OS field of the HINFO RDATA SHOULD be set to the null
   string to minimize the size of the response.

   The TTL encoded for the synthesised HINFO RR SHOULD be chosen by the
   operator of the DNS responder to be large enough to suppress frequent
   subsequent ANY queries from the same initiator with the same QNAME,
   understanding that a TTL that is too long might make policy changes
   relating to ANY queries difficult to change in the future.  The
   specific value used is hence a familiar balance when choosing TTL for
   any RR in any zone, and be specified according to local policy.

   If the DNS query includes DO=1 and the QNAME corresponds to a zone
   that is known by the responder to be signed, a valid RRSIG for the
   RRSets in the answer (or authority if answer is empty) section MUST
   be returned.  In the case of DO=0, the RRSIG SHOULD be omitted.

4.3.  Answer with Best Guess as to Intention

   In some cases it is possible to guess what the initiator wants in the
   answer but not always.  Some implementations have implemented the
   spirit of this document by returning all of CNAME or (MX A and AAAA)
   RRsets that are present.  This is not a guess but a heuristic that
   seems to work well in practice.  The main drawback is the size of the
   answer.

Internet-Draft      Minimal Responses for ANY Queries         March 2018


   As in the first one if the zone is signed RRSIG MUST be returned if
   there the DO bit is set on query.

4.4.  Behaviour with TCP Transport

   A DNS responder MAY behave differently when processing ANY queries
   received over different transport, e.g. by providing a conventional,
   full response over TCP whilst using one of the other mechanisms
   specified in this document in the case where a query was received
   using UDP.

   Implementers SHOULD provide configuration options to allow operators
   to specify different behaviour over UDP and TCP.

5.  Behaviour of DNS Initiators

   A DNS initiator which sends a query with QTYPE=ANY and receives a
   response containing an HINFO resource record or a single RRset, as
   described in Section 4, MAY cache the response in the normal way.
   Such cached resource records SHOULD be retained in the cache
   following normal caching semantics, as it would with any other
   response received from a DNS responder.

   A DNS initiator MAY suppress queries with QTYPE=ANY in the event that
   the local cache contains a matching HINFO resource record with
   RDATA.CPU field, as described in Section 4.  A DNS initiator MAY
   instead respond to such queries with the contents of the local cache
   in the usual way.

6.  HINFO Considerations

   It is possible that the synthesised HINFO RRSet in an ANY response,
   once cached by the initiator, might suppress subsequent queries from
   the same initiator with QTYPE=HINFO.  Thus the use of HINFO in this
   proposal would hence have effectively mask the HINFO RRSet present in
   the zone.

   Authority-server operators who serve zones that rely upon
   conventional use of the HINFO RRTYPE SHOULD sensibly choose the
   "single RRset" method described in this document or select another
   type.

   The HINFO RRTYPE is believed to be rarely used in the DNS at the time
   of writing, based on observations made at recursive servers,
   authority servers and in passive DNS.

7.  Updates to RFC 1035

   It is important to note that returning a subset of available RRSets
   when processing an ANY query is legitimate and consistent with
   [RFC1035]; ANY does not mean ALL.  The main difference here is that
   the TC bit SHOULD not be set on the response indicating that this is
   not a complete answer.

   This document describes optional behaviour for both DNS initiators
   and responders, and implementation of the guidance provided by this
   document is OPTIONAL.

   RRSIG queries (i.e. queries with QTYPE=RRSIG) are similar to ANY
   queries in the sense that they have the potential to generate large
   responses as well as extra work for the responders that process them,
   e.g. in the case where signatures are generated on-the-fly.  RRSIG
   RRSets are not usually obtained using such explicit queries, but are
   rather included in the responses for other RRSets that the RRSIGs
   cover.  This document does not specify appropriate behaviour for
   RRSIG queries, but note that future such advice might well benefit
   from consistency with and experience of the approaches for ANY
   queries described here.

8.  Implementation Experience

   In October 2015 Cloudflare Authoritative Name server implementation
   implemented the HINFO response.  A few minor problems were reported
   and have since been resolved.

   An implementation of the subset-mode response to ANY queries was
   implemented in NSD 4.1 in 2016.

   An implementation of a single RRSet response to an ANY query was made
   for BIND9 by Tony Finch, and that functionality was subsequently made
   available in production releases starting in BIND 9.11.

9.  Security Considerations

   Queries with QTYPE=ANY are frequently observed as part of reflection
   attacks, since a relatively small query can be used to elicit a large
   response; this is a desirable characteristic if the goal is to
   maximize the amplification potential of a DNS server as part of a
   volumetric attack.  The ability of a DNS operator to suppress such
   responses on a particular server makes that server a less useful
   amplifier.

Internet-Draft      Minimal Responses for ANY Queries         March 2018


   The optional behaviour described in this document to reduce the size
   of responses to queries with QTYPE=ANY is compatible with the use of
   DNSSEC by both initiator and responder.

10.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to update the Resource Record (RR) TYPEs
   Registry [1] entry as follows:

   +------+-------+-------------------------------+--------------------+
   | Type | Value | Meaning                       | Reference          |
   +------+-------+-------------------------------+--------------------+
   | *    | 255   | A request for some or all     | [RFC1035][RFC6895] |
   |      |       | records the server has        | [This Document]    |
   |      |       | available                     |                    |
   +------+-------+-------------------------------+--------------------+
