1.  Introduction

   Implementing intelligence only in the Cloud cannot fulfill all of the
   requirements of industrial IoT.  The Cloud will not always provide
   the needed response within bounded latency requirements.  Low latency
   requirements are often critical for applications such as automatic
   control, video surveillance/delivery, power distribution. and fault
   alarm.  The massive number of assets connected to the Cloud require a
   large amount of bandwidth to transmit the raw data, and the Cloud
   needs large computation and storage resources to handle this high
   volume of data.  The raw data often contains sensitive information
   and the leakage of this data from the Cloud may cause harm to the the
   business.  Most industrial environments don't want to put all the
   data in one place, ie, the Cloud.  Distributed Edge Computing is
   proposed to deal with these industrial requirements.

   Edge computing is a distributed open platform at the network edge,
   close to the things or data sources, integrating the capabilities of
   networks, storage, and applications.  By delivering edge intelligence
   services, edge computing meets the key requirements of industry
   digitalization for agile connectivity, real-time services, data

   optimization, application intelligence, security and privacy
   protection.

   Various organizations are working on the industrialization of Edge
   Computing.  In 2017, ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC41 established the edge
   computing research group to promote the standardization of Edge
   Computing.  In 2016, the Edge Computing Consortium (ECC) was set up
   to work on the commercial implementation in different industrial
   verticals.  In 2017, the edge computing task group was established
   inside the Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC) to work on the
   reference architecture of edge computing.

   Local, low latency computation, storage and communication are the
   three main aspects of Edge Computing.  Communication is the key to
   enable data flow between assets, from assets to gateway, between
   gateways at the edge, from the gateway to the Cloud, etc., which all
   fall naturally into the scope of IETF.

   This document identifies the requirements of Edge Computing in the
   industrial domain, and investigates the related standardization gaps
   for each requirement.  Its the intention of this draft to identify
   the gaps which may need to be addressed within the IETF

2.  Inter-operability of the Industrial Internet

   According to a 2015 survey by IoT Nexus, 77% of professionals
   surveyed believe that interoperability is the largest challenge
   facing the Industrial Internet.  Different industrial branches such
   as product lines, factories and logistics will need to interact
   closely with each other or even merge.  And legacy machines will
   continue to exist until the factory is fully upgraded.  The
   interoperability between legacy and upgraded equipment will need to
   become commonplace.

2.1.  Gateway between two Industrial Networks

   Currently, there are more than 40 fieldbus technologies being used in
   the industrial domain, such as Profibus, CANopen, Modbus, providing
   low cost digital industrial connection.  However, their data rates
   are limited, and the hardware integration is complicated.  Industrial
   Ethernet, like PROFINET, SECOSI, EtherCAT and POWERLINK, can provide
   a unified hardware interface, higher data rate and reusable Internet
   protocols.  But the incompatibility between different technologies is
   still unresolved, which makes one local network unable to communicate
   with another if they speak different machine languages.  When
   manufacturers want to extend their product line, they need to
   purchase equipment which speaks a specific language, which leads to
   vendor locked-in.  Equipment which is using legacy fieldbus



Zhang, et al.           Expires September 6, 2018               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft         Edge Computing Gap Analysis            March 2018


   technologies will need to be abandoned when the manufacturers want to
   upgrade their network.

   In order to enable the direct communication between two subnets which
   speak different languages or to realize backward compatibility,
   protocol translation is indispensable.  Edge computing nodes will
   serve as the gateway between two industrial networks and will be an
   ideal place to implement this translation function.  Therefore, one
   identified gap is to define the mapping between any two machine
   languages that are considered to be popular.  It is suggested that
   SDOs (such as the IETF) or commercial consortiums related to
   operational technologies, will provide a solution to this item.

2.2.  Overlay for the Industrial Internet

   Usually the processing plants, workshops or factory locations of a
   specific manufacturer have their own unique products within various
   industrial verticals, and the control logic is locally closed to
   achieve high reliability and robustness.  The data is also kept in
   local networks and cannot be used by the others, creating information
   silos.  Next generation manufacturing requires close interaction of
   different branches to achieve flexibility, optimality and efficiency.
   For example, two parallel assembly lines can synchronize their paces
   via interconnection; when one processing section sends out alarms,
   the other sections will be informed and react proactively.  The robot
   in the logistics network, for example, can transport various
   materials to the production network within the necessary response
   time.

   The industrial networks speak different physical languages.
   Therefore, an overlay is required to achieve the interconnection
   between multiple networks.  Different machine languages are
   translated into a common protocol used as the overlay.  The edge
   computing nodes can realize the protocol conversion at the ingress of
   the overlay and act as routers in the overlay network.  For small or
   medium scale, e.g. inside a workshop or a factory, the overlay can be
   done by TSN tunnelling or thru a dedicated fiber-optic channel.  For
   large scale, e.g. two factories in two cities, L2VPN/L3VPN on public
   network can be used.  If time sensitive applications are carried, the
   bonded-latency requirement should be added.

   Industrial IoT systems are both delay sensitive and loss sensitive,
   which rely on very robust and predictable network connections.  The
   overlay must meet these requirements.  The recent paradigm in
   transportation layer congestion control to avoid loss and provide
   short delay still has a long tail for the perform, which does not
   meet the requirement of Industrial IoT.  The traditional industrial
   systems use redundancy to guarantee the high availability for

   networks on critical infrastructure (HSR: High-availability Seamless
   Redundancy, PRP: Parallel Redundancy Protocol), which is a high cost
   solution and faces the interoperability problem among different
   systems.  IEEE 802.1 defined the TSN (time-sensitive- network)
   technical standards, aiming to promote standardization and
   interoperability of real-time Ethernet networks, so that data flows
   demanding bounded latency and best effort data flows can be
   transmitted in one single network.  Inside IETF, the DETNET working
   group is working on an L3 overall architecture for deterministic
   networking.  It is promising to have foo-over-DETNET/TSN in the
   future.  Therefore a gap may or may not exist to provide a solution
   to this protocol conversion overlay.

3.  Configuration and Management

3.1.  Central Configuration

   The network SHOULD be configured before the industrial operation.
   And the configuration can also be changed during the operation to
   better meet the requirements.  The configuration MAY include Node_ID,
   connectivity between nodes, the network topology, the end to end
   paths and their bandwidth and latency requirements.  The connectivity
   between nodes can be configured by Pub/Sub pattern, in which the
   senders publish the messages in different classes, and the receivers
   subscribe to the classes they are interested in.  The publishers
   don't have knowledge about the subscriber, and vice versa.

   The configuration can be done in a centralized way via Netconf and
   YANG model.  The information model of different verticals to describe
   the data type in YANG should be unified, so that a data in one
   vertical can be recognized by another verticals.

3.2.  Firmware Update

   The firmware of devices needs to be updated on-demand to deal with
   security vulnerabilities, to update the installed applications or to
   install new ones.  The update can be conducted via HTTP or FTP.
   However, how to update the firmware for constrained devices in a more
   secure and efficient way is still an open issue.  The SUIT (BOF) is
   aiming to work on the related solutions.

3.3.  Naming and Addressing

   Given massive amount of heterogeneous devices deployed across
   different Industrial IoT platforms, naming and addressing play as a
   key role to coordinate the back-end data center, edge and end
   devices, e.g., the efficient upstream sensory data collection,




Zhang, et al.           Expires September 6, 2018               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft         Edge Computing Gap Analysis            March 2018


   content-based data filtering and matching, and downstream efficient
   control by applications.

   Currently used schemes like IP and URI are experiencing some big
   challenges, which are not efficient in the context of Industrial IoT.
   The changes in date centers/edge/end devices should be transparent to
   others and the changes including but not limited to the migration of
   the service (like storage, database) in date centers/edge, the update
   of the program in end devices and so on.

   IPv6 is expected to be the base of IoT in the future and its lack of
   mobility and security inherently has been extending for a while.  It
   is a very essential requirement for the computing purpose that the
   naming and addressing could be far more flexible, agile and secure
   than what we could provide today.  Besides IP related solutions, some
   other naming schemes have been developed (e.g., Object Name Service
   (ONS), IoT@Work naming scheme, NDN, MobilityFirst, etc.), each which
   could have a place in some certain domains but not a cure to a
   general IIoT naming and addressing problem.

4.  Mobility and Migration

   Some scenarios require mobility, e.g. when a mobile robot moves from
   one workshop to another, it may also roam between two edge computing
   nodes.  The applications, running in the previous edge computing node
   SHOULD migrate to the current node, so that the robot's task is
   uninterrupted.  The applications can migrate between edge computing
   nodes with different capabilities and different hardware, e.g.
   gateways, server clusters and all types of nodes in between.

   The applications can be encapsulated in containers or virtual
   machines to facilitate the migration between edge computing nodes.
   The states in the previous ECN SHOULD be synchronized to the new ECN,
   so that the latter can run the application continuously.  Common APIs
   SHOULD be defined for different types of ECNs to shield the
   heterogeneity.  A layer-2 network SHOULD be created to facilitate the
   VM mobility [RFC8302] [I-D.ietf-nvo3-vmm].  New API migration
   solutions may be needed.

5.  South bound Communication

   In the south bound, the edge computing node MAY connect to various
   devices using different kinds of protocols, such as Ethernet, WiFi,
   Bluetooth, Power Line Communication, RF, RS485, etc.  Thus the ECNs
   will be versatile protocol speakers.

   The applications, which belong to different users, SHOULD be able to
   operate simultaneously on the ECNs.  Tenant segregation MUST be

   implemented to ensure a user's data, configuration and
   functionalities are not impacted by another user.  TRILL may help
   realize the segregation by logical isolation of network traffic.
   Default TRILL configuration supports 4094 VLANs, which is enough
   since the tenants at the edge would not be as many as those in a data
   center.  If edge cloud orchestration applies, however, tenant
   segregation on the cloud may exceed 4094.  For such case, a longer
   label than 12-bit VLAN label should be used [RFC7172] [RFC7348].

   Inside the IETF, ROLL (routing protocols in LLN), 6lo (IP adaptation
   of Bluetooth, PLC, RS485, etc.) and LPWAN (RF communication protocols
   including LoRa, Sigfox, Wi-SUN and NB-IoT) may provide southbound
   solutions.  The 6TiSCH WG's work is promising to handle the
   requirement of adding deterministic features in RF networks.

6.  Orchestration between the Edge and the Cloud

   In Edge Computing, the distribution of intelligence is hierarchical.
   For example, in manufacturing, Edge Computing Nodes can be deployed
   on the machine tools for process configuration and status monitoring;
   at the pipeline level, Edge Computing Nodes can be used for product
   flow orchestration; higher at the factory level, Edge Computing Nodes
   takes care of the coordiantion of different pipelines.

   The data sent out by the terminals should be processed with various
   requirements, which hopfully can be fulfilled at different levels.
   For example, the data in automatic control should be processed at low
   level to guarantee the bounded latency.  And some key data should be
   stored for a long time at higher level, e.g. on the Cloud.  The
   sample data for complex deep learning algorithms should be sent to
   higher level possesseding enough processing power.

   The terminals can generate data with various processing requirements.
   How to deliver the data to the right level of Edge Intelligence
   remains a gap to be covered.  A potential solution is to introduce
   these requirements inside the packet, so an Edge Computing Node can
   know whether to process it locally or upload it to the higher level.
   A primary idea for this to add requirement options into the IPv6
   header and define objective functions (OF) deployed at the Edge
   Computing Node to make the decision.
