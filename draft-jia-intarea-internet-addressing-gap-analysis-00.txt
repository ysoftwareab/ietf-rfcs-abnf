                  Gap Analysis in Internet Addressing
         draft-jia-intarea-internet-addressing-gap-analysis-00

Abstract

   There exist many extensions to Internet addressing, as it is defined
   in [RFC0791] for IPv4 and [RFC8200] for IPv6, respectively.  Those
   extensions have been developed to fill gaps in capabilities beyond
   the basic properties of Internet addressing.  This document outlines
   those properties as a baseline against which the extensions are
   categorized in terms of methodology used to fill the gap together
   with examples of solutions doing so.

   While introducing such extensions, we outline the issues we see with
   those extensions.  This ultimately leads to consider whether or not a
   more consistent approach to tackling the identified gaps, beyond
   point-wise extensions as done so far, would be beneficial.  The
   benefits are the ones detailed in the companion document
   [I-D.jia-intarea-scenarios-problems-addressing], where, leveraging on
   the gaps identified in this memo and scenarios provided in
   [I-D.jia-intarea-scenarios-problems-addressing], a clear problem
   statement is provided.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.jia-intarea-scenarios-problems-addressing] outlines scenarios
   and problems in Internet addressing through presenting a number of
   cases of communication that have emerged over the many years of
   utilizing the Internet and for which various extensions to the
   network interface-centric addressing of IPv6 have been developed.  In
   order to continue the discussion on the emerging needs for
   addressing, initiated with
   [I-D.jia-intarea-scenarios-problems-addressing], this memo aims at
   identifying gaps between the Internet addressing model and desirable
   features that have been added by various extensions, in various
   contexts.

   Our approach to identifying the gaps is guided by key properties of
   Internet addressing, outlined in Section 2, namely (i) the fixed
   length of the IP addresses, (ii) the ambiguity of IP addresses
   semantic, while still (iii) providing limited IP address semantic
   support only.  We derive those properties directly as a consequence
   of the respective standards that provide the basis for Internet
   addressing, most notably [RFC0791] for IPv4 and [RFC8200] for IPv6,
   respectively.

   Those basic properties, and the potential issues that arise from
   those properties, give way to extensions that have been proposed over
   the course of deploying new Internet technologies.  Section 3
   discusses those extensions, summarized as gaps against the basic
   properties in Section 4.

   Finally, we outline issues that arise with the extension-driven
   approach to the basic Internet addressing, discussed in Section 5.
   We argue that any requirements for solutions that would revise the
   basic Internet addressing would require to address those issues.

2.  Properties of Internet Addressing

   As the Internet Protocol adoption has grown towards the global
   communication system we know today, its characteristics have evolved
   subtly, with [RFC6250] documenting various aspects of the IP service
   model and its frequent misconceptions, including Internet addressing.

Internet-Draft     Gap Analysis in Internet Addressing         July 2021


   In this section, we articulate the three most acknowledged properties
   related to _Internet addressing_. Those are (i) fixed IP address
   length, (ii) ambiguous IP address semantic, and (iii) limited IP
   address semantic support.

   In Section 3, we elaborate on various extensions that aim to expand
   Internet addressing beyond those properties; we position those
   extensions as intentions to close perceived gaps against those key
   properties.

2.1.  Property 1: Fixed Address Length

   The fixed IP address length is specified as a key property of the
   design of Internet addressing, with 32 bits for IPv4 ([RFC0791]), and
   128 bits for IPv6 ([RFC8200]), respectively.  Given the capability of
   the hardware at the time of IPv4 design, a fixed length address was
   considered as a more appropriate choice for efficient packet
   forwarding.  Although the address length was once considered to be
   variable during the design of Internet Protocol Next Generation
   ("IPng", cf., [RFC1752]) in 1990s, it finally inherited the design of
   IPv4 and adopted a fixed length address towards the current IPv6.  As
   a consequence, the 128-bit fixed address length of IPv6 is regarded
   as a balance between fast forwarding (i.e., fixed length) and
   practically boundless cyberspace (128-bit length).

2.2.  Property 2: Ambiguous Address Semantic

   Initially, the meaning of an IP address has been to identify an
   interface on a network device, although, when [RFC0791] was written,
   there were no explicit definitions of the IP address semantic.

   With the global expansion of the Internet protocol, the semantic of
   the IP address is commonly believed to contain at least two notions,
   i.e., the explicit "locator", and the implicit "identifier".  Because
   of the increasing use of IP addresses to both identify a node and to
   indicate the physical or virtual location of the node, the
   intertwined address semantics of identifier and locator was then
   gradually observed and first documented in [RFC2101] as "locator/
   identifier overload" property.  With this, the IP address is used as
   an identification for host and server, very often directly used,
   e.g., for remote access or maintenance.

2.3.  Property 3: Limited Address Semantic Support

   Although IPv4 [RFC0791] did not add any semantic to IP addresses
   beyond interface identification (and location), time has proven that
   additional semantics are desirable (c.f., the history of 127/8
   [HISTORY127] or the introduction of private addresses [RFC1918]),



Jia, et al.             Expires January 13, 2022                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft     Gap Analysis in Internet Addressing         July 2021


   hence, IPv6 [RFC4291] introduced some form of additional semantics
   based on specific prefix values, for instance link-local addresses or
   a more structured multicast addressing.  Nevertheless, systematic
   support for rich address semantics remains limited and basically
   prefix-based.

3.  Filling Gaps through Extensions to Internet Addressing Properties

   Over the years, a plethora of extensions has been proposed in order
   to move beyond the native properties of IP addresses.  We interpret
   the development of those extensions as filling gaps between the
   original properties of Internet addressing, outlined in the previous
   section, and desired new capabilities that those developing the
   extensions identified as being needed and desirable.

3.1.  Length Extensions

   Extensions in this subsection aim at extending the property described
   in Section 2.1, i.e., fixed IP address length.

   When IPv6 was designed, the main objective was to create an address
   space that would not lead to the same situation as IPv4, namely to
   address exhaustion.  To this end, while keeping the same addressing
   model like IPv4, IPv6 adopted a 128-bit address length with the aim
   of providing a sufficient and future-proof address space.  The choice
   was also founded on the assumption that advances in hardware and
   Moore's law would still allow to make routing and forwarding faster,
   and IPv6 routing table manageable.

   We observe, however, that the rise of new use cases but also the
   number of new, e.g., industrial/home or small footprint devices, was
   possibly unforeseen.  Sensor networks and more generally the Internet
   of Things (IoT) emerged after the core body of work in IPv6.
   Nevertheless, it was clear from the beginning that differently from
   IPv6 assumptions, 128-bit addresses were costly in certain scenarios.

   At the same time, new use cases emerged, where addresses even bigger
   than 128-bit are useful, like in the context of content centric
   networks, structured addresses, or cryptographically generated
   addresses.

3.1.1.  Shorter Address Length

3.1.1.1.  Description:

   In the context of IoT [RFC7228], where bandwidth and energy are very
   scarce resources, the static length of 128-bit for an IP address is
   more a hindrance than a benefit since 128-bit for an IP address may

Internet-Draft     Gap Analysis in Internet Addressing         July 2021


   occupy a lot of space, even to the point of being the dominant part
   of a packet.  In order to use bandwidth more efficiently and use less
   energy in end-to-end communication, solutions have been proposed that
   allow for very small network layer headers instead.

3.1.1.2.  Methodology:

   *Header Compression/Translation*: One of the main approaches to
   reduce header size in the IoT context is by header compression.  Such
   technique is based on a stateful approach, utilizing what is usually
   called a "context" on the IoT sensor and the gateway for
   communications between an IoT device and a server placed somewhere in
   the Internet - from the edge to the cloud.

   The role of the "context" is to provide a way to "compress" the
   original IP header in a smaller one, by using shorter address
   information and/or dropping some field, using the context as a kind
   of dictionary.

   *Separate device from locator identifier*: Approaches that can offer
   customized address length that is adequate for use in such
   constrained domains are preferred.  Using different namespaces for
   the 'device identifier' and the 'routing' or 'locator identifier' is
   one such approach.

3.1.1.3.  Examples

   *Header Compression/Translation*: Considering one base station is
   supposed to serve hundreds of user devices, maximizing the
   effectiveness for specific spectrum directly improve user quality of
   experience.  To achieve the optimal utilization of the spectrum
   resource in wireless area, the RObust Header Compression (ROHC)
   [RFC5795] mechanism, which has been widely adopted in cellar network
   like WCDMA, LTE, and 5G, utilizes header compression to shrink
   existing IPv6 headers onto shorter ones.

   Similarly, header compression techniques for IPv6 over Low-Power
   Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) have been around for
   several years now, constituting a main example of using the notion of
   a shared context in order to reduce the size of the network layer
   header ([RFC6282], [RFC7400], [ITU9959]).  More recently, other
   compression solution have been proposed for Low Power Wide Area
   Networks (LPWAN - [RFC8376]), but they basically rely on the same
   "context" approach ([RFC8724]).

   Also, constraints coming from either devices or carrier links would
   lead to mixed scenarios and compound requirements for extraordinary
   header compression.  For native IPv6 communications on DECT ULE and

   MS/TP Networks [RFC6282], dedicated compression mechanisms are
   specified in [RFC8105] and [RFC8163], while the transmission of IPv6
   packets over NFC and PLC, specifications are being developed in
   [I-D.ietf-6lo-nfc] and [I-D.ietf-6lo-plc].

   *Separate device from locator identifier*: Solutions such as proposed
   in [EIBP] and [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis] can utilize a separation of
   device from locator, where only the latter is used for routing
   between the different domains using the same technology, therefore
   enabling the use of shorter addresses in the (possibly constrained)
   local environment.  Device IDs used within such domains are carried
   as part of the payload by EIBP and hence can be of shorter size
   suited to the domain, while, for instance, in LISP a flexible address
   encoding [RFC8060] allows shorter addresses to be supported in the
   LISP control plane [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis].

3.1.2.  Longer Address Length

3.1.2.1.  Description

   To address current networking demands it may be preferred to use
   variable and longer address lengths.  For example in content delivery
   networks, longer addresses such as URLs are required to fetch
   content, an approach that information-centric networking (ICN)
   applied for any data packet sent in the network, using information-
   based addressing.  Further, as an approach to address the routing
   challenges faced in the Internet, structured addresses may be used,
   avoiding the need for routing protocols.

   Further, as an approach to address the routing challenges such as
   scalability, stability and the complex interworking between OSPF,
   eBGP and iBGP faced in the Internet, structured addresses may be
   used, avoiding the need for routing protocols overall.

3.1.2.2.  Methodology

   The crucial need for longer address lengths comes from _semantic
   extensions_ to IP addresses, where the extensions themselves do not
   fit within the length limitation of the IP address.  Section 3.3
   discusses those extensions, divided into those where limitations
   stemming from the IP address lengths are considered and those where
   information is either represented through a longer address and/or
   additional header information.

3.1.2.3.  Examples

   See Section 3.3 for examples of solutions that consider extended
   address and header information to represent extended semantics that
   are not limited by the IP address length.

3.2.  Identity Extensions

   Extensions in this subsection try extending the property described in
   Section 2.2, i.e., "locator/identifier overload" of the ambiguous
   address semantic.

   From the perspective of Internet users, on the one hand, the implicit
   identifier semantic result in the privacy issue of network behavior
   tracking and association.  Despite that IP address assignment may be
   dynamic, they are nowadays considered as a personal data and as such
   undergoes privacy protection regulations like General Data Protection
   Regulation ("GDPR", cf. [GDPR]).  Hence, additional mechanism are
   necessary in order to protect end user privacy.

   For network regulation of sensitive information, on the other hand,
   dynamically allocated IP addresses are not sufficient to guarantee
   device or user identification.  As such, different address allocation
   systems, with stronger identification properties are necessary where
   security and authentication are at highest priority.  Hence, in order
   to protect information security within a network, additional
   mechanism are necessary to identify the users or the devices attached
   to the network.

3.2.1.  Anonymous Address Identity

3.2.1.1.  Description

   As discussed in Section 2.2, IP addresses reveal both 'network
   locations' as well as implicit 'identifier' information to both
   traversed network elements and destination nodes alike.  This enables
   recording, correlation, and profiling of user behaviors and
   historical network traces, possibly down to individual real user
   identity.  The IETF, e.g., in [RFC7258], has taken a clear stand on
   preventing any such pervasive monitoring means by classifying them as
   an attack on end users' right to be left along (i.e., privacy).
   Regulations such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation
   (GDPR) classifies, for instance, the 'online identifier' as personal
   data which must be carefully protected; this includes end users' IP
   addresses [GDPR].

   Even before pervasive monitoring [RFC7258], IP addresses have been
   seen as something that some organizational owners of networked system
   may not want to reveal at the individual level towards any non-member
   of the same organization.

3.2.1.2.  Methodology:

   *Traffic Proxy*: Detouring the traffic to a trusted proxy is a
   heuristic solution.  Since nodes between trusted proxy and
   destination (including the destination per se) can only observe the
   source address of the proxy, the "identification" of the origin
   source can thereby be hidden.  To confuse the nodes between origin
   and the proxy, the traffic on such route would be encrypted via a key
   negotiated either in-band or off-band.  Considering that all
   applications' traffic in such route can be seen as a unique flow
   directed to the same "unknown" node, i.e., the trusted proxy,
   eavesdroppers in such route have to make more efforts to correlate
   user behavior through statistical analysis even if they are capable
   of identifying the users via their source addresses.  The protection
   lays in the inability to isolate single application specific flows.
   According to the methodology, such approach is IP version independent
   and works for both IPv4 and IPv6.

   *Source Address Rollover*: Privacy issues related to address
   "identifier" semantic can be mitigated through regular change (beyond
   the typical 24 hours lease of DHCP).  Built on the inevitabilities of
   "identifier" that IP address carries, such approach promote to change
   the source IP address at certain frequency.  Under such methodology,
   refresh cycling window may reach to a balance between privacy
   protection and address update cost.  Due to the limited space that
   IPv4 contains, such approach usually works for IPv6 only.

Internet-Draft     Gap Analysis in Internet Addressing         July 2021


   *Private Address Spaces*: Their introduction in [RFC1918] foresaw
   private addresses (assigned to specific address spaces by the IANA)
   as a means to communicate purely locally, e.g., within an enterprise,
   by separating private from public IP addresses.  Considering that
   private addresses are never directly reachable from the Internet,
   hosts adopting private addresses are invisible and thus "anonymous"
   for the Internet.  Besides, hosts for purely local communication used
   the latter while hosts requiring public Internet service access would
   still use public IP addresses.

   *Address Translation*: The aforementioned original intention for
   using private IP addresses, namely for purely local communication,
   resulted in a lack of flexibility in changing from local to public
   Internet access on the basis of what application would require which
   type of service.

   If eventually every end-system in an organization would require some
   form of public Internet access in addition to local one, an adequate
   number of public Internet addresses would be required for providing
   to all end systems.  Instead, address translation enables to utilize
   many private IP addresses within an organization, while only relying
   on one (or few) public IP addresses for the overall organization.

   In principle, address translation can be applied recursively.  This
   can be seen in modern broadband access where Internet providers may
   rely on carrier-grade address translation for all their broadband
   customers, who in turn employ address translation of their internal
   home or office addresses to those (private again) IP addresses
   assigned to them by their network provider.

   Two benefits arise from the use of (private to public IP) address
   translation, namely (i) the hiding of local end systems at the level
   of the (address) assigned organization, and (ii) the reduction of
   public IP addresses necessary for communication across the Internet.
   While the latter has been seen for long as a driver for address
   translation, we focus on the first issue in this section, also since
   we see such privacy benefit as well as objective as still being valid
   in addressing systems like IPv6 where address scarcity is all but
   gone [GNATCATCHER].

   *Separate device from locator identifier*: Solutions that make a
   clear separation between the routing locator and the identifier, can
   allow for a device ID of any size, which in turn can be encrypted by
   a network element deployed at the border of routing domain (e.g., a
   router).  Both source and end domain addresses can be encrypted and
   transported, as in the routing domain, only the routing locator is
   used.

3.2.1.3.  Examples:

   *Traffic Proxy*: Although not initially designed for traffic proxy,
   Virtual Private Network (VPN, cf. [VPN]) is widely utilized for
   packets origin hiding as a traffic detouring methodology.  As it
   evolved, VPN derivatives like WireGuard [WireGuard] become a
   mainstream instance for user privacy and security enhancement.

   With such methodology in mind, onion routing [ONION], instantiated in
   the TOR Project [TOR], achieves high anonymity through traffic hand
   over via intermediates before reaching the destination.  Since the
   architecture of TOR requires at least three proxies in traffic, none
   of them is aware of the entire route.  Given that the proxies
   themselves can be deployed all over the cyberspace, trust will not be
   the prerequisite if proxies are randomly selected.

   In addition, dedicated protocols are also expected to be customized
   for privacy improvement via traffic proxy.  For example, Oblivious
   DNS over HTTPS (ODoH, cf. [ODoH]) use a third-part proxy to obscure
   identifications of user source addresses during DNS over HTTPS (DoH,
   cf. [RFC8484]) resolution.  Similarly, Oblivious HTTP [OHTTP] involve
   proxy alike in the HTTP environment.

   *Source Address Rollover*: As for source address rollover, it has
   been standardized that IP addresses for Internet users should be
   dynamic and temporary every time they are being generated [RFC8981].
   This benefits from the available address space in the case of IPv6,
   through which address generation or assignment should be
   unpredictable and stochastic for outside observers.

   More radically, [EPHEMERALv6] advocates an 'ephemeral address' for
   each process that change over time.  Through this, correlating user
   behaviors conducted by different identifiers (i.e., source address)
   becomes hard, if not impossible, based on the IP packet header alone.

   *Private Addresses*: The use and assignment of private address for
   IPv4 is laid out in [RFC1918], while unique local addresses (ULAs) in
   IPv6 [RFC4193] take over the role of private address spaces in IPv4.

   *Network Address Translation*: The translation from one IP address
   realm into another is laid out in [RFC2663], using a stateful address
   binding to translate between the realms, e.g., from a private into a
   public address space.  As outlined in [RFC2663], basic address
   translation is usually extended to include port information in the
   translation process, support bidirectional or simple outbound traffic
   only.  Given address translation can be performed several times in
   cascade, NATs may exist as part of existing customer premise
   equipment (CPE), such as a cable or an Ethernet router, with private

   wired/wireless connectivity, or may be provided in a carrier
   environment to further translate ISP-internal private addresses to a
   pool of (assigned) public IP addresses.  The latter is often
   dynamically assigned to CPEs upon bootstrapping of the CPE.

   *Separate device from locator identifier*: EIBP [EIBP] utilizes a
   structured approach to addressing.  It separates the routing ID from
   the device ID, where only the routing ID is used for routing.  Hence
   the device IDs can be encrypted.  Similarly, LISP uses separate
   namespaces for routing and identification allowing to "hide"
   identifiers in encrypted LISP packets that expose only known routing
   information [RFC8061].

3.2.2.  Authenticated Address Identity

3.2.2.1.  Description

   In some scenarios (e.g., corporate networks) it desirable to being
   able authenticate IP addresses so to prevent malicious attackers to
   spoof IP addresses.  This is usually achieved by using a mechanism
   that allows to prove ownership of the IP address.

3.2.2.2.  Methodology

   *Self-certified addresses*: This method is usually based on the use
   of nodes' public/private keys.  A node creates its own interface ID
   (IID) by using a cryptographic hash of its public key (with some
   additional parameters).  Messages are then signed using the nodes'
   private key.  The destination of the message will verify the
   signature through the information in the IP address.  Self-
   certification has the advantage that no third party or additional
   security infrastructure is needed.  Any node can generate its own
   address locally and then only the address and the public key are
   needed to verify the binding between the public key and the address.

   *Third party granted addresses*: DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration
   Protocol) is widely used to provide IP addresses, however, in its
   basic form, it does not perform any check and even an unauthorized
   user without the right to use the network can obtain an IP address.
   To solve this problem, a trusted third party has to grant access to
   the network before generating an address (via DHCP or other) that
   identifies the user.  User authentication done securely either based
   on physical parameters like MAC addresses or based on an explicit
   login/password mechanism.

3.2.2.3.  Examples

   *Self-certified Addresses*: Major example of this methodology is
   [RFC3972], where IPv6 cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) are
   defined.  The original specs have been already amended (cf.,
   [RFC4581] and [RFC4982]) in order to support multiple (stronger)
   cryptographic algorithms.

   *Third party granted addresses*: [RFC3118] defines a DHCP option
   through which authorization tickets can be generated and newly
   attached hosts with proper authorization can be automatically
   configured from an authenticated DHCP server.  Solutions exists where
   separate servers are used for user authentication ([UA-DHCP],
   [RFC4014])

3.3.  Semantic Extensions

   Extensions in this subsection try extending the property described in
   Section 2.3, i.e., limited address semantic support.

   As explained in Section 2.2, IP addresses carry both locator and
   interface identification semantic.  Some efforts exists in trying to
   separate these semantics either in different address spaces or
   through different address format.  Beyond just identification,
   location, and the fixed address size, other efforts extended the
   semantic through existing or additional header fields (or header
   options) outside the Internet address.

3.3.1.  Utilizing Extended Address Semantics

3.3.1.1.  Description

   Several extensions have been developed to extend beyond the limited
   IPv6 semantics.  Those approaches may include to apply structure to
   the address, utilize specific prefixes or entirely utilize the IPv6
   address for different semantics while re-encapsulating the original
   packet to restore the semantics in another part of the network.  For
   instance, structured addresses have the capability to introduce
   delimiters to identify semantic information in the header, therefore
   not constraining any semantic by size limitations of the address
   fields.  We note here that extensions often start out as being
   proposed as an extended header semantic, while standardization may
   drive the solution to adopt an approach to accommodate their semantic
   within the limitations of an IP address.  This section does include
   examples of this kind.

3.3.1.2.  Methodology

   *Semantic prefixes*: Semantic prefixes are used to separate the IPv6
   address space.  Through this, new address families, such as for
   information-centric networking [HICN], service routing or other
   semantically rich addressing, can be defined, albeit limited by the
   prefix length and structure as well as the overall length limitation
   of the IPv6 address.

   *Separate device from locator identifier*: The option to use separate
   namespaces for the device address (w.r.t. the router locator), would
   offer more freedom for the use of different semantics.

   *Structured addressing*: One approach to address the routing
   challenges faced in the internet proposes the use of structured
   addresses, to void the need for routing protocols.  Benefits of this
   approach can be significant, with the structured addresses capturing



Jia, et al.             Expires January 13, 2022               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft     Gap Analysis in Internet Addressing         July 2021


   the relative physical or virtual position of routers in the network,
   and being variable in length.  Key to the approach, however, is that
   the structured addresses capturing the relative physical or virtual
   position of routers in the network, or networks in an internetwork
   may not fit within the fixed and limited IP address length (cf.,
   Section 3.1.2).  Other approaches to structured approaches may be the
   definition of application-specific structured binary components as a
   generalization of the URL schema used for HTTP-level communication.

   *Localized forwarding semantics*: Layer 2 hardware, such as SDN
   switches, are limited to the use of specific header fields for
   forwarding decisions.  Hence, devising new localized forwarding
   mechanisms may make use of existing header fields such as the IPv6
   source/destination field to achieve the desired forwarding behavior,
   while encapsulating the original IPv6 packets into the payload in
   order to be restored at the local forwarding network boundary.
   Network sizes in those solutions are limited by the size of the
   utilized address field, e.g., 256 bits for IPv6, thereby limiting the
   size of networks where such techniques could be used.  The IPv6
   address information provided in the encapsulated packet purely serves
   identifying the network endpoint, not its location.

3.3.1.3.  Examples

   *Semantic prefixes*: Newer approaches to IP anycast suggest the use
   of service identification in combination with a binding IP address
   model [SFCANYCAST] as a way to allow for metric-based traffic
   steering decisions; approaches for Service Function Chaining (SFC)
   [RFC7665] utilize the next service header (NSH) information and
   packet classification to determine the destination of the next packet
   hop.

   Another example of the usage of different packet header extensions
   based in IP addressing is Segment Routing.  In this case the source
   chooses a path and encodes it in the packet header as an ordered list
   of segments.  Segments are coded at header of IPv6 Packet, based on
   the definition of a new Routing Extensions Header type, the Segment
   Routing Header (SRH), which contains Segment List.  This is similar
   to what is already specified in RFC2460.  Packets are then
   transmitted from source node with a list of segment ID (SID) inserted
   at header List dictates the path to follow in the network.  Such
   segment ID are coded as 128 bit IPv6 addresses.

   Approaches such as [HICN] utilize semantic prefixing to allow for ICN
   forwarding behavior within an IPv6 network.  In this case an HICN
   name is the hierarchical concatenation of a name prefix and a name
   suffix, in which the name prefix is encoded as an IPv6 128 bits word
   and carried in IPv6 header fields, while the name suffix is encoded



Jia, et al.             Expires January 13, 2022               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft     Gap Analysis in Internet Addressing         July 2021


   in transport headers fields such as TCP.  However, it is a challenge
   to determine which IPv6 prefixes should be used as name prefixes.  In
   order to know which IPv6 packets should be interpreted based on an
   ICN semantic, it is desirable to be able to recognize that an IPv6
   prefix is a name prefix, e.g. to define a specific address family
   (AF_HICN, b0001::/16).  This establishment of a specific address
   family allows the management and control plane to locally configure
   HICN prefixes and announce them to neighbors for interconnection.

   *Separate device from locator identifier*: EIBP [EIBP] separates the
   routing locator from the device identifier, relaxing therefore any
   semantic constraints on the device identifier.  Similarly, LISP uses
   a flexible encoding named LISP Canonical Address Format (LCAF
   [RFC8061]), which allows to associate to routing locators any
   possible form (and length) of identifier.  ILNP [RFC6740] introduces
   as well a different semantic of IP addresses, while aligning to the
   IPv6 address format (128 bits).  Basically, ILNP introduces a sharper
   logical separation between the 64 most significant bits and the 64
   least significant bits of an IPv6 address.  The former being a global
   locator, while the latter being an identifier that can have different
   semantic (rather than just being an interface identifier).

   *Structured addressing*: Network topology captures the physical
   connectivity among devices in the network.  There is a structure
   associated with the topology.  Examples are the core-distribution-
   access router structure commonly used in enterprise networks and clos
   topologies that are used to provide multiple connections between Top
   of Rack (ToR) devices and multiple layers of spine devices.  Internet
   service providers use a tier structure that defines their business
   relationships.  A clear structure of connected networks can be
   noticed in the internet.  EIBP [EIBP] proposes to leverage the
   physical structure (or a virtual structure overlaid on the physical
   structure) to auto assign addresses to routers in a network or
   networks in an internetwork to capture their relative position in the
   physical/virtual topology.  EIBP proposes to administratively
   identify routers/networks with a tier value based on the structure.

   *Localized forwarding semantics*: Approaches such as those outlined
   in [REED] suggest using a novel forwarding semantic based on path
   information carried in the packet itself, said path information
   consists in a fixed size bitfield (see [REED] for more information on
   how to represent the path information in said bitfield).  In order to
   utilize existing, e.g., SDN-based, forwarding switches, the direct
   use of the IPv6 source/destination address is suggested for building
   appropriate match-action rules (over the suitable binary information
   representing the local output ports), while preserving the original
   IPv6 information in the encapsulated packet.  As mentioned above,
   such use of the existing IPv6 address fields limits the size of the

Internet-Draft     Gap Analysis in Internet Addressing         July 2021


   network to a maximum of 256 bits (therefore paths in the network over
   which such packets can be forwarded).  [ICNIP], however, goes a step
   further by suggesting to use the local forwarding as direct network
   layer mechanism, removing the IP packet and only leaving the
   transport/application layer, with the path identifier constituting
   the network-level identifier albeit limited by using the existing IP
   header for backward compatibility reason (the next section outlines
   the removal of this limitation).

3.3.2.  Utilizing Existing or Extended Header Semantics

3.3.2.1.  Description:

   While the former sub-section explored extended address semantic,
   thereby limiting any such extended semantic with that of the existing
   IPv6 semantic and length, additional semantics may also be placed
   into the header of the packet or the packet itself, utilized for the
   forwarding decision to the appropriate endpoint according to the
   extended semantic.

   Reasons for embedding such new semantics may be related to traffic
   engineering since it has long been shown that the IP address itself
   is not enough to steer traffic properly since the IP address itself
   is not semantically rich enough to adequately describe the forwarding
   decision to be taken in the network, not only impacting WHERE the
   packet will need to go but also HOW it will need to be sent.

3.3.2.2.  Methodology:

   *In-Header extensions*: One way to add additional semantic besides
   the address fields is to use other fields already present in the
   header.

   *Headers option extensions*: Another mechanism to add additional
   semantic is to actually add additional fields, e.g., through Header
   Options in IPv4 or through Extension Headers in IPv6.

   *Re-encapsulation extension*: A more radical approach for additional
   semantic is the use of a complete new header that is designed so to
   carry the desired semantic in an efficient way (often as a shim
   header).

   *Structured addressing*: Similar to the methodology that structures
   addresses within the limitations of the IPv6 address length, outlined
   in the previous sub-sections, structured addressing can also be
   applied within existing or extended header semantics, e.g., utilizing
   a dedicated (extension) header to carry the structured address
   information.

Internet-Draft     Gap Analysis in Internet Addressing         July 2021


   *Localized forwarding semantics*: This set of solutions apply
   capabilities of newer (programmable) forwarding technology, such as
   [P4], to utilize any header information for a localized forwarding
   decision.  This removes any limitation to use existing header or
   address information for embedding a new address semantic into the
   transferred packet.

3.3.2.3.  Examples:

   *In-Header extensions:* In order to allow additional semantic with
   respect to the pure Internet addressing, the original design of IPv4
   included the field "Type of Service" [RFC2474], while IPv6 introduced
   the "Flow label" and the "Traffic Class" [RFC8200].  In a certain
   way, those fields can be considered "semantic extensions" of IP
   addresses, and they are "in-header" because natively present in the
   IP header (differently from options and extension headers).  However,
   they proved not to be sufficient.  Very often a variety of network
   operation are performed on the well-known 5-tuple (source and
   destination addresses; source and destination port number; and
   protocol number).  In some contexts all of the above mentioned fields
   are used in order to have a very fine grained solution ([RFC8939]).

   *Headers option extensions:* Header options have been largely under
   exploited in IPv4.  However, the introduction of the more efficient
   extension header model in IPv6 along with technology progress made
   the use of header extensions more widespread in IPv6.  Segment
   Routing re-introduced the possibility to add path semantic to the
   packet by encoding a loosely defined source routing ([RFC8402]).
   Similarly, in the aim to overcome the inherent shortcoming of the
   multi-homing in the IP context, SHIM6 ([RFC5533]) also proposed the
   use of an extension header able to carry multi-homing information
   which cannot be accommodated natively in the IPv6 header.

   To serve a moving endpoint, mechanisms like Mobile IPv6 [RFC6275] are
   used for the maintenance of connection continuity by a dedicated IPv6
   extension header.  In such a case, the IP address of the home agent
   in Mobile IPv6 is basically an identification of the on-going
   communication.  In order to go beyond the interface identification
   model of IP, the Host Identity Protocol (HIP) tries to introduce an
   identification layer to provide (as the name says) host
   identification.  The whole architecture relies on the use of another
   type of extension header [RFC7401].

   *Re-encapsulation extension:* Differently from the previous approach,
   re-encapsulation prepends complete new IP headers to the original
   packet introducing a completely custom shim header between the outer
   and inner header.  This is the case for LISP, adding a LISP specific
   header right after an IP+UDP header ([I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis]).  A



Jia, et al.             Expires January 13, 2022               [Page 18]

Internet-Draft     Gap Analysis in Internet Addressing         July 2021


   similar design is used by VxLAN ([RFC7348]) and GENEVE ([RFC8926]),
   even if they are designed for a data center context.  IP packets can
   also be wrapped with headers using more generic and semantically rich
   names, for instance with ICN [ICNIP].

   *Structured addressing:* Solutions such as those described in the
   previous sub-section, e.g., EIBP [EIBP], can provide structured
   addresses that are not limited to the IPv6 address length but instead
   carry the information in an extension header to remove such
   limitation.

   Also information-centric networking (ICN) naming approaches usually
   introduce structures in the (information) names without limiting
   themselves to the IP address length; more so, ICN proposes its own
   header format and therefore radically breaks with not only IP
   addressing semantic but the format of the packet header overall.  For
   this, approaches such as those described in [RFC8609] define a TLV-
   based binary application component structure that is carried as a
   'name' part of the CCN messages.  Such a name is a hierarchical
   structure for identifying and locating a data object, which contains
   a sequence of name components.  Names are coded based on 2-level
   nested Type-Length-Value (TLV) encodings, where the name-type field
   in the outer TLV indicates this is a name, while the inner TLVs are
   name components including a generic name component, an implicit
   SHA-256 digest component and a SHA-256 digest of Interest parameters.
   For textual representation, URIs are normally used to represent
   names, as defined in [RFC3986].

   In geographic addressing, position based routing protocols use the
   geographic location of nodes as their addresses, and packets are
   forwarded when possible in a greedy manner towards the destination.
   For this purpose the packet header includes a field coding the
   geographic coordinates (x, y, z) of the destination node, as defined
   in [RFC2009].  Some proposals also rely on extra fields in the packet
   header to code the distance towards the destination, in which case
   only the geographic coordinates of neighbors are exchanged.  This way
   the location of the destination is protected even if routing packets
   are eavesdropped.

   *Localized forwarding semantics:* Unlike the original suggestion in
   [REED] to use existing SDN switches, the proliferation of P4 [P4]
   opens up the possibility to utilize a locally limited address
   semantic, expressed through the path identifier, as an entirely new
   header (including its new address) with an encapsulation of the IP
   packet for E2E delivery (including further delivery outside the
   localized forwarding network or positioning the limited address
   semantic directly as the network address semantic for the packet,
   i.e., removing any IP packet encapsulation from the forwarded packet,



Jia, et al.             Expires January 13, 2022               [Page 19]

Internet-Draft     Gap Analysis in Internet Addressing         July 2021


   as done in [ICNIP].  Removing the IPv6 address size limitation by not
   utilizing the existing IP header for the forwarding decision also
   allows for extensible length approaches for building the path
   identifier with the potential for increasing the supported network
   size.  On the downside, this approach requires to encapsulate the

   these extensions in extending the properties of Internet addressing.

   Internet addressing, or extend other properties at the same time.

     Table 4: Relationship between Extensions and Internet Addressing

5.  Issues in Extensions to Internet Addressing

   While the extensions to the original Internet properties discussed in
   Section 3 demonstrate the flexibility of the basic proposed
   mechanisms, they also bring with them a number of issues, which we
   discuss in the following section.  For this, we outline the problems
   caused, linking those to the approaches to extensions summarized in
   Section 4.

5.1.  Limiting Address Semantics

   Many approaches changing the semantics of communication, e.g.,
   through separating host identification from network node
   identification [RFC7401], separating the device identifier from the
   routing locator ([EIBP], [I-D.ietf-lisp-introduction]), or through
   identifying content and services directly [HICN], are limited by the
   existing packet size and semantic constraints of IPv6, e.g., in the
   form of its source and destination network addresses.

   While approaches such as [ICNIP] may override the addressing
   semantics, e.g., by replacing IPv6 source and destination information
   with path identification, a possible unawareness of endpoints still
   requires the carrying of other address information as part of the
   payload.

   Also, the expressible service or content semantic may be limited, as
   in [HICN] or the size of supported networks [REED] due to relying on
   the limited bit positions usable in IPv6 addresses.

5.2.  Complexity and Efficiency

   A crucial issue is the additional complexity introduced for realizing
   the additional addressing semantics.  This is particularly an issue
   since we see those additional semantics particularly at the edge of
   the Internet, utilizing the existing addressing semantic of the
   Internet to interconnect the domains that require those additional
   semantics.





Jia, et al.             Expires January 13, 2022               [Page 22]

Internet-Draft     Gap Analysis in Internet Addressing         July 2021


   Furthermore, any additional complexity can often come with an
   efficiency and cost penalty, particularly at the edge of the network,
   where resource constraints may play a significant role.  Compression
   processes, taking ROHC as an example, require additional resources
   both for the sender generating the compressed header but also the
   gateway linking to the general Internet by re-establishing the full
   IP header (cf., [ROHC]).

   Conversely, the performance requirements of core networks, in terms
   of packet processing speed, make the accommodation of extensions to
   addressing often prohibitive.  This is not only due to the necessary
   extra processing that is specific to the extension, but also due to
   the complexity that will need to be managed in doing so at
   significantly higher speeds than at the edge of the network.  The
   observations on the dropping of packets with IPv6 extension headers
   in the real world is (partially) due to such a implementation
   complexity [RFC7872].

   Another example for lowering the efficiency of packet forwarding is
   the routing in systems like TOR [TOR].  As detailed before, traffic
   in TOR, for anonymity purposes, should be handed over by at least
   three intermediates before reaching the destination.  Thus, frequent
   relaying enhances the privacy, however, because such kind of
   solutions have to be implemented at application level, which comes at
   the cost of lower communication efficiency.  May be a different
   privacy enhanced address semantic would enable efficient
   implementation of TOR-like solutions at network layer.

5.2.1.  Repetitive encapsulation

   Repetitive encapsulation is an issue 'bloating' packet sizes with
   additional encapsulation headers.  Addressing proposals such as those
   in [ICNIP] utilize path identification within an alternative
   forwarding architecture that acts upon the provided path
   identification.  However, due to the limitation of existing flow-
   based architectures with respect to the supported header structures
   (in the form of IPv4 or IPv6 headers), the new routing semantics are
   being inserted into the existing header structure, while repeating
   the original, sender-generated header structure, in the payload of
   the packet as it traverses the local domain, effectively doubling the
   header overhead per packet.

   The problem is also present in a number of solutions tackling
   different issues, e.g., mobility [I-D.ietf-lisp-mn], DC networking
   ([RFC8926], [RFC7348], [I-D.ietf-intarea-gue]), traffic engineering
   [RFC8986], and privacy ([TOR], [SPHINX]).  Certainly these solutions
   are able to avoid other issues, like path lengthening or privacy
   issues, as described later, but they come at the price of multiple

Internet-Draft     Gap Analysis in Internet Addressing         July 2021


   encapsulations that reduce the effective payload.  This not only
   hampers efficiency in terms of header-to-payload ratio but also
   introduces "encapsulation points", which in turn add complexity to
   the (often edge) network as well as fragility due to introducing
   possible failure points; we discuss this aspect more in Section 5.4.

5.2.2.  Compounding issues with header compression

   IP header overhead requires header compression in constrained
   environments, such as wireless sensor networks and IoT in general.
   Together with fragmentation, both tasks constitute significant energy
   consumption, as shown in [HEADER_COMP_ISSUES1], negatively impacting
   reduced function devices that often rely on battery for operation.
   Further, the reliance on the compression/decompression points creates
   a dependence on such gateways, which may be a problem for
   intermittent scenarios.

   According to implementation of _contiki-ng_ [CONTIKI], an example of
   operating system for IoT devices, the source codes for 6LowPan
   requires at least 600kb to include a header compression process.  In
   certain use cases, such requirement can be an obstacle for extremely
   constrained devices, especially for the RAM and energy consumption.

5.2.3.  Introducing Path Stretch

   Mobile IP [RFC6275], which was designed for connection continuity in
   the face of moving endpoints, is a typical case for path stretch.
   Since traffic must follow a triangular route before arriving at the
   destination, such detour routing inevitably impacts transmission
   efficiency as well as latency.

5.2.4.  Complicating Traffic Engineering

   While many extensions to the original IP address semantic target to
   enrich the decisions that can be taken to steer traffic according to
   requirements for, e.g., QoS, mobility, chaining, compute/network
   metrics, flow treatment, path usage, etc., the realization of the
   mechanisms as individual solutions likely complicates the original
   goal of traffic engineering when individual solutions are being used
   in combination.  Ultimately, this may even prevent the combined use
   of more than one mechanism and/or policies with a need to identify
   and prevent incompatibilities of mechanisms.  Key here is not the
   issue arising from using conflicting traffic engineering polices but
   conflicting realizations of policies that may well generally work
   well alongside ([ROBUSTSDN], [TRANSACTIONSDN]).

   This not only increases fragility, as we will discuss separately in
   Section 5.4, but also requires careful planning for which mechanisms



Jia, et al.             Expires January 13, 2022               [Page 24]

Internet-Draft     Gap Analysis in Internet Addressing         July 2021


   to use and in which combination, likely needing human-in-the-loop
   approaches alongside possible automation approaches for the
   individual solutions.

5.3.  Security

   The properties described in Section 2 have, obviously, also
   consequences in terms of security and privacy related issues, as
   already mentioned in other parts of this document.

   For instance, in the effort of being somehow backward compatible, HIP
   [RFC7401] uses 128-bit Host Identity, which may be not sufficiently
   cryptographically strong in the future because of the limited size
   (future computational power may erode 128-bit security).  Similarly,
   CGA [RFC3972] also align to the 128-bit limit but may use only 59
   bits of them, hence, the packet signature may not be sufficiently
   robust to attacks [I-D.rafiee-6man-cga-attack].

   IP addresses, even temporary ones meant to protect privacy, have been
   long recognized as a "Personal Identification Information" that
   allows even to geolocate the communicating endpoints [RFC8280].  The
   use of temporary addresses provides sufficient privacy protection
   only if the renewal rate is high [EPHEMERALv6].  However, this causes
   additional issues, like the large overhead due to the Duplicate
   Address Detection, the impact on the Neighbor Discovery mechanism, in
   particular the cache, which can even lead to communication
   disruption.  With such drawbacks, the extensions may even lead to
   defeat the target actually lowering security rather than increasing
   it.

   The introduction of alternative addressing semantics has also been
   used to help in (D)DoS attacks mitigation.  This leverages on
   changing the service identification model so to avoid topological
   information exposure, making the potential disruptions likely remain
   limited [ADDRLESS].  However, this increased robustness to DDoS comes
   at the price of important communication setup latency and fragility,
   as discussed next.

5.4.  Fragility

   From the extensions discussed in Section 3, it is evident that having
   alternative or additional address semantic and formats available for
   making routing as well as forwarding decisions dependent on these, is
   common place in the Internet.  This, however, adds many extension-
   specific translation/adaptation points, mapping the semantic and
   format in one context into what is meaningful in another context, but
   also, more importantly, creating a dependency towards an additional

Internet-Draft     Gap Analysis in Internet Addressing         July 2021


   component, often without explicit exposure to the endpoints that
   originally intended to communicate.

   For instance, the re-writing of IP addresses to facilitate the use of
   private address spaces throughout the public Internet, realized
   through network address translators (NATs), conflicts with the end-
   to-end nature of communication between two endpoints.  Additional
   (flow) state is required at the NAT middlebox to smoothly allow
   communication, which in turn creates a dependency between the NAT and
   the end-to-end communication between those endpoints, thus increasing
   the fragility of the communication relation.

   A similar situation arises when supporting constrained environments
   through a header compression mechanism, adding the need for, e.g., a
   ROHC [RFC5795] element in the communication path, with communication-
   related compression state being held outside the communicating
   endpoints.  Failure will introduce some inefficiencies due to context
   regeneration, which may affects the communicating endpoints,
   increasing fragility of the system overall.

   Such translation/adaptation between semantic extensions to the
   original 'semantic' of an IP address is generally not avoidable when
   accommodating more than a single universal semantic.  However, the
   solution-specific nature of every single extension is likely to
   noticeably increase the fragility of the overall system, since
   individual extensions will need to interact with other extensions
   that may be deployed in parallel, but were not designed taking into
   account such deployment scenario (cf., [I-D.ietf-intarea-tunnels]).
   Considering that extensions to traditional per-hop-behavior (based on
   IP addresses) can essentially be realized over almost 'any' packet
   field, the possible number of conflicting behaviors or diverging
   interpretation of the semantic and/or content of such fields, among
   different extensions, may soon become an issue, requiring careful
   testing and delineation at the boundaries of the network within which
   the specific extension has been realized.

6.  Summary of issues in Extensions to Internet Addressing

   Table 5, derived from Section 5, summarize the issues related to each
   of the extension.  As summarized, each extension involves at least
   one issue.  For extension like ICNIP, several issues may be involved
   at the same time.  Further, as explained in Section 5.4, "fragility"
   does not mean that the extensions are fragile per-se, they are robust
   for the task they have been designed for, rather we refer to the
   existence of additional components that may fail (as Murphy's law
   teach us), hence, making the overall system more fragile.

Internet-Draft     Gap Analysis in Internet Addressing         July 2021


           Table 5: Issues in Extensions to Internet Addressing

7.  Conclusions

   The examples of extensions discussed in Section 3 to the original
   Internet addressing scheme show that extensibility beyond the
   original model (and its underlying per-hop behavior) is a desired
   capability for networking technologies and has been so for a long
   time.  Generally, we can observe that those extensions are driven by
   the requirements of stakeholders, expecting a desirable extended
   functionality from the introduction of the specific extension.  If
   interoperability is required, those extensions require
   standardization of possibly new fields, new semantics as well as
   (network and/or end system) operations alike.

   One could argue that the power of the packet header (and the entire
   packet for that matter) lies in its potential to be used for
   extensions that satisfy the various requirements of those developing
   the extensions with given deployments and use cases in mind.  The
   author in [EXPRESSIVE-POWER] argues that this capability represents
   the 'expressive power of the Internet design', with developments such
   as Software-Defined Networking (SDN) enabling per-hop operations (to
   be specified in dedicated match-action rules) that take more than
   just the IP address as input, even beyond the strict IP header,
   albeit still limited to certain packet header(s) fields, as in the
   OpenFlow specification [OPENFLOW].

   Beyond the fragility, discussed in this document, caused by adding,
   overriding, amending semantics and behaviors (and deploying them in a
   running system), such approach to extensibility that opens up other
   header fields may, however, also be limiting the realization of per-
   hop operations.  As an example, although the authors in [REED]
   utilize the power of SDN to enable extension-specific per-hop
   behaviors that follow path-based rather than endpoint locator
   semantics, they do so within the limitation of currently supported
   header fields in SDN.  The result is the overriding of the IPv6
   source/destination address with the semantic input (here the path
   forwarding identifier) for the desired per-hop behavior, which in
   turn creates the need for border translation to avoid 'leaking' such
   (malformed) IPv6-like packet into a standard IPv6 network.  Leaving
   the IPv6 address information intact albeit unused is not possible due
   to the lack of accommodating the extended per-hop behavior
   information needed for the proposed solution.

   Since the publication of [REED] (and its realization in existing real
   world trials), the newer P4 technology has removed this limitation,
   therefore positioning the entire packet content as input into per-hop

   behavior and removing the need for overriding existing packet fields
   and restoring their semantics at the borders of the network.

   We see such evolution of per-hop behavior implementation as closing
   the loop to approaches to addressing considered in early days of the
   packet-based networking [RFC0757][POSTEL], based on structured and
   flexible addresses, similar to the heap or stack model suggestions
   found in [EXPRESSIVE-POWER].  We believe that approaching addressing
   from such desire to enable extensions by design rather than through a
   pure extension engineering approach would also address possible
   fragility and security issues due to unwanted interactions between
   possibly incompatible extensions, while also enabling more efficient
   realization of the extensions through a common execution point in the
   forwarding element.

   The issues we identified with the extension-specific solution
   approach, point to the need for a discussion on Internet addressing,
   as formulated in the companion document
   [I-D.jia-intarea-scenarios-problems-addressing] that formalizes the
   problem statement through scenarios that highlight the shortcomings
   of the Internet addressing model.

   It is our conclusion that the existence of the many extensions to the
   original Internet addressing is clear evidence for gaps that have
   been identified over time by the wider Internet community: it is time
   to develop an architectural but more importantly a sustainable
   approach to make Internet addressing extensible in order to capture
   the many new uses we will still identify for the Internet to come.
   Any inaction on our side in that regard will only compound the issues
   we identified, eventually hampering the future Internet's readiness
   for those new uses.

8.  Security Considerations

   The present memo does not introduce any new technology and/or
   mechanism and as such does not introduce any security threat to the
   TCP/IP protocol suite.

   As an additional note, and as we discussed in this document, security
   and privacy aspects were not considered as part of the key properties
   for Internet addressing, which led to the introduction of a number of
   extensions intending to fix those gaps.  The analysis presented in
   this memo (non-exhaustively) shows those issues are either solved in
   an ad-hoc manner at application level, or at transport layer, while
   at network level only few extensions tackling specific aspects exist
   albeit often with limitations due to the adherence to the Internet
   addressing model and its properties.
