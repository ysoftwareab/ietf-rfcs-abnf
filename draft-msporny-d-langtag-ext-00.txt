1.  Introduction

   [RFC5646] permits the definition and registration of language tag
   extensions "that contain a language component and are compatible with
   applications that understand language tags".  This document defines
   an extension for identifying text direction using language tags.  The
   "singleton" identifier for this extension is 'd'.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

2.  RFC5646 Required Information

   Language tags, as defined by [RFC5646], are useful for identifying
   the language of content.  Some operating environments also use the
   language tag to determine text direction, which can be problematic.
   This extension provides a mechanism for explicitly stating the
   direction of a specific language-tagged string.

2.1.  Summary

   The subtags available for use in the 'd' extension consist of the
   values 'ltr', 'rtl', and 'auto' for expressing text direction that is
   "left-to-right", "right-to-left", and "automatically detected",
   respectively.

   For example, the language tag "ar-d-rtl" consists of:

   o  The base language tag "ar" (Arabic), exactly as defined by
      [RFC5646].

Internet-Draft            BCP 47 Text Direction                 May 2019


   o  The singleton 'd', identifying this extension.

   o  The attribute 'rtl', which specifies a direction of "right to
      left".

   Only the first occurrence of an attribute or key conveys meaning in a
   language tag.  When interpreting tags containing the direction
   extension, duplicate attributes or keywords are ignored in the
   following way: ignore any attribute that has already appeared in the
   tag and ignore any keyword whose key has already occurred in the tag.

2.1.1.  Canonicalization

   As required by [RFC5646], the use of uppercase or lowercase letters
   is not significant in the subtags used in this extension.  The
   canonical form for all subtags in the extension is lowercase.  The
   canonical order of attributes is in [US-ASCII] order (that is,
   numbers before letters, with letters sorted as lowercase US-ASCII
   code points).  The canonical order of keywords is in [US-ASCII] order
   by key.  The order of subtags within a keyword is significant; the
   meaning of this extension is altered if those subtags are rearranged.
   Thus, the canonical form of the extension never reorders the subtags
   within a keyword.

2.2.  Registration Form

   Per RFC 5646, Section 3.7 [RFC5646]:

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document will require IANA to insert the record in Section 2.2
   into the Language Extensions Registry, according to Section 3.7.
   Extensions and the Extensions Registry of "Tags for Identifying
   Languages" in [RFC5646].

   This document does not require IANA to create or maintain a new
   registry or otherwise impact IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for this extension are the same as those
   for [RFC5646].  See RFC 5646, Section 6, Security Considerations
   [RFC5646].
