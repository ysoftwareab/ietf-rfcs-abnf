Abstract

   Internet Drafts and RFCs have traditionally been produced using a
   variety of tools, including nroff.  This memo describes production of
   Internet Drafts and RFCs using a set of troff/nroff macros suitable
   for that purpose.  Public comments regarding this memo may be sent to
   the rfc-interest mailing list.

Internet Draft      Writing I-Ds and RFCs using troff       January 2005

1. Introduction

   The Instructions to RFC Authors [N1.RFC2223] describes the editorial
   format of RFCs and outlines editorial production of Internet Drafts
   and RFCs using basic troff directives [I1.CSTR54] with the ms macro
   package [I2.ms] and a postprocessor which is necessitated by use of
   the ms macro package.  However, use of basic directives and the ms
   macro package is not ideal.

1.1. Basic Directives Are at Too Low a Level

   Use of basic troff directives is not ideal for authors or editors who
   are not familiar with troff arcana.  On the one hand, the example in
   [N1.RFC2223] uses a larger variety of troff directives than some
   casual users might be familiar with.  On the other hand, instead of
   using directives such as .tl to produce first page headings, it
   suggests that authors or editors should count characters to manually
   justify the first page heading.

1.2. Authors Specify Content Rather Than Issue Directives

   Another problem with directives is that authors are not primarily
   concerned with formatting details.  An author needs to indicate
   things like "this is the document title" or "a new section starts
   here".  Authors rarely think in low-level formatting terms such as
   are provided by basic troff directives, e.g. "center the next 3
   lines".

1.3. ms Macros Are Not Designed For RFCs

   Macros provide a mechanism for authors to specify type of content
   rather than formatting details.  However, use of the ms macro package
   is not ideal for production of RFCs and Internet Drafts as that macro
   package was not designed for the specific document format described
   in [N1.RFC2223].  Use of some high-level ms macros results in text
   which violates some provisions of the [N1.RFC2223] format, while
   other ms macros are unusable due to differences between RFC document
   format and the types of documents that the ms package was designed to
   produce.  There are also implementation differences in different
   versions of "ms" macro packages.  Finally, it is the ms macro package
   which has stymied the RFC Editor's attempts to get a form feed
   character at the end of each page [N1.RFC2223], [I3.RFC1543].

1.4. RFC-specific Macros

   This memo describes use of a macro package which is designed
   specifically for production of RFCs and Internet Drafts, which
   provides a high-level abstraction to insulate authors and editors
   from many troff details and frees authors and editors from tedium
   such as counting characters.

2. Requirement Levels

   The key words "SHOULD" and "SHOULD NOT" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in [N2.BCP14].

3. Processing

   Production of a document using troff and a macro package proceeds in
   several stages:

   1. A mixture of free-form text, processing directives, and material
      describing non-textual content (tables, diagrams, etc.) is
      generated by the author.

   2. Preprocessors [I4.CSTR49], [I5.CSTR114], [I6.CSTR116],
      [I7.CSTR122], [I8.eqn], [I9.CSTR142] may be used to transform
      descriptions of tables, diagrams, etc.

   3. A formatter transforms instructions and other input into a
      formatted document according to rules corresponding to the desired
      document format.

   4. Some postprocessing may take place to repaginate output and to
      make final adjustments to the output format.

   Tools, e.g. [I10.make], are available to automate the preprocessor,
   formatter, and postprocessing portions of document processing,
   freeing the author to concentrate on the document content.

4. Input Format

   Input consists of text to be formatted, directives that specify
   formatting parameters and actions, and special sequences that provide
   access to saved strings and numbers.  Directives consist of a line
   beginning with a period (also known as "dot").  The dot may be
   followed by space characters, and then a named directive.  The name
   consists of one or more printing characters.  Many directives also
   take arguments, which are space-separated strings of characters.
   Unless directed otherwise, input is collected and formed into
   paragraphs without regard to line breaks in the input.  Input text
   consisting of the lines:

Internet Draft      Writing I-Ds and RFCs using troff       January 2005

.IP
All bad precedents
begin with
justifiable measures. \" Julius Caesar
.\" This is a comment.
A strong conviction
that something must be done
is the parent of
many bad measures. \" Daniel Webster
Any excuse
will serve
a tyrant. \" Aesop

   is formatted into an indented paragraph which looks like:

   All bad precedents begin with justifiable measures.  A strong
   conviction that something must be done is the parent of many bad
   measures.  Any excuse will serve a tyrant.

   The character sequence \" introduces a comment which continues to the
   end of the line.  If an entire line is a comment, starting the line
   with a dot followed by the comment ensures that extra space does not
   appear in the output.  Authors should be careful about use of the
   backslash, which is an escape character that introduces special
   sequences.  If it is necessary to have a backslash appear in the
   formatted output, the sequence \e, i.e. a backslash followed by a
   lower-case letter e, will produce it.  Unescaped backslashes followed
   by double quotes have been known to cause important text to vanish
   from published RFCs.

5. Specifics

5.1. Loading the RFC Macros

   The first directive should be the line:

.so tmac.rfc

   That directs the processor to read the contents of a file named
   "tmac.rfc", which contains the macros that describe the RFC format,
   holds some boilerplate text, and provides convenience functions.

5.2. Specifying the Document Particulars

5.2.1. Titles, Long and Short

   Each RFC or Internet Draft has a title, one or more authors, etc.
   These are specified with directives.  For example:

.TL "Writing Internet\-Drafts and Requests For Comments using troff and\
\& nroff

   Specifies the document title (TL).  The double-quote causes the
   remainder of the (logical) line to be taken as a single argument to

Lilly                    Expires August 1, 2005                 [Page 5]

Internet Draft      Writing I-Ds and RFCs using troff       January 2005

   the TL macro; otherwise each space character would be taken as an
   argument separator.  Note also that a backslash character appears
   before the hyphen; that causes the hyphen to be interpreted as a
   normal text hyphen rather than as an indication of a possible
   hyphenation (line-breaking) point.  The backslash at the end of the
   first line escapes the end-of-line, allowing the line to effectively
   continue with the contents of the second line.  Escape sequences are
   discussed in detail in [I1.CSTR54].  There is a short title (ST)
   macro which is used to specify a short version of the document title
   for use in the page headings.  For this document, that was specified
   as:

.ST "Writing I\-Ds and RFCs using troff

5.2.2. RFC or Draft Version Number

   RFCs have an RFC number assigned by the RFC Editor, and Internet
   Drafts have a version number.  The number is specified with the NU
   macro: a negative number is interpreted as an incremental version
   number for a draft; -1 for draft version -00, -2 for draft version
   -01, etc.  A positive number is interpreted as an RFC number and
   SHOULD only be assigned by the RFC Editor.  A zero value is treated
   like an RFC, but prints XXXX where an RFC number would appear.

5.2.3. Document Category (RFCs)

   RFCs have a category; one of Experimental, Informational, Standards
   Track, or Best Current Practice [I11.BCP9].  The category is
   specified as the argument to the CA macro, which need only be
   supplied for RFCs (it is ignored in drafts).

5.2.4. Updated and Obsoleted RFCs

   Some RFCs update or obsolete earlier RFCs.  If an RFC is updated by
   the document, the number of the updated RFC should be specified as
   the argument to an UP macro.  Similarly, an obsoleted RFC is
   indicated by an argument to an OB macro.  Multiple UP and OB macros
   may be used to indicate that multiple RFCs are updated or obsoleted.

5.2.5. Internet Draft File Name

   An Internet Draft has a file name used for retrieval; the base file
   name (without the trailing hyphen and version number suffix) is
   specified as the argument to the FN macro, which is not necessary (is
   ignored) for RFCs.

5.2.6. Authors

   An Internet Draft or RFC may have up to five authors specified.
   Information for each author may be specified via the AU macro.  The
   macro takes 9 arguments:

Internet Draft      Writing I-Ds and RFCs using troff       January 2005

   Argument                          Description
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
      1       First initial and surname for first page heading
      2       First name and/or initials for Author's Address section
      3       Surname for page footer and Author's Address section
      4       Gender; one of m (male), f (female), or o (other or
              indeterminate)
      5       Internet mailbox
      6       Telephone Number
      7       Fax Number
      8       URL
      9       Affiliation

   The author's gender is used to customize boilerplate verbiage to
   accommodate enforcers of political correctness.  Arguments containing
   space characters must be enclosed in double quotes.  Arguments that
   are not used must have an empty double quoted string or other
   zero-width (printed) argument as a placeholder.  Optional text
   following the AU macro line is collected verbatim (without flowing
   into a paragraph) as the postal address for the author.  Similar
   information can be provided for additional authors by additional AU
   macro calls.

5.2.7. Date

   The date used for the document heading is normally the current date
   when formatted.  It can be explicitly specified via the DT macro
   which takes three arguments (4-digit year, month, and day
   respectively).

5.2.8. Numbered and Unnumbered Sections and Table of Contents

   An RFC or Internet Draft may contain numbered sections.  Sections may
   have subsections, and the section level represents the level of
   subsections.  This section of this document has level 3.  A long
   document benefits from a Table of Contents.  As sections are
   specified, the rfc macro package collects information for a Table of
   Contents.  The TC macro takes two arguments.  The first specifies the
   number of pages to reserve for the Table of Contents (zero to omit
   the table), and the second argument specifies the maximum section
   level to include in the Table of Contents entries.

5.2.9. Independent vs. IETF Submissions

   Internet Drafts and RFCs may be products of IETF Working Groups or
   other IETF entities, or they may be independent submissions.  The
   macro IS is used to identify independent submissions, as there is a
   slight difference in the boilerplate text which accompanies them.
   The IS macro takes no arguments.

   Unfortunately, the IETF Secretariat rejects independent submissions
   that have the independent submission boilerplate required by the RFC
   Editor [I12.Instruct] (bottom of page 33), probably because it is not
   recognized by Henrik Levkowetz' "idnits" program.  Therefore, until

Internet Draft      Writing I-Ds and RFCs using troff       January 2005

   the IETF Secretariat and the RFC Editor resolve their differences the
   IS macro SHOULD NOT be used except by the RFC Editor.

5.2.10. Optional Notices

   Certain optional notices may be placed at the front of Internet
   Drafts.  The ON macro can be used to specify one of the following
   notices via a numerical argument:

   Type                               Text
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    1     This document may not be modified, and derivative works of it
          may not be created.  This document may only be posted in an
          Internet-Draft.
    2     This document may not be modified, and derivative works of it
          may not be created, except to publish it as an RFC and to
          translate it into languages other than English.

   If a second argument is given to the ON macro, it is interpreted as
   the number of a section that may be extracted.  The text is modified
   to reflect that.  For example:

.ON 1 1.2.3

   produces the text:

   This document may not be modified, and derivative works of it may not
   be created other than to extract section 1.2.3 as-is for separate
   use.  This document may only be posted in an Internet-Draft.

5.3. Document Content

5.3.1. Abstract

   Having specified such preliminary information, the document content
   may be specified.  The first item that an author might want to
   provide is the Abstract for the document.  It is initiated with the
   AB macro, which takes no arguments.  It collects text until the next
   macro directive into a paragraph for the document abstract.  An
   abstract is required for an Internet Draft; it is optional for an
   RFC.

5.3.2. Numbered and Unnumbered Sections

   Additional document content is usually organized into sections.
   There are two types of sections: numbered and unnumbered.  For the
   purpose of collecting headings for the Table of Contents, unnumbered
   sections have a section "level" even though no number appears.  A
   section is initiated with an SH macro for unnumbered sections, or an
   NH macro for numbered sections.  Each macro takes two arguments: the
   section level and the section heading text.  Numbering for numbered
   sections is computed automatically.

Internet Draft      Writing I-Ds and RFCs using troff       January 2005

5.3.3. Paragraphs

   Within sections, text is organized into paragraphs.  RFCs and
   Internet Drafts usually use indented block paragraphs like this one;
   these are introduced with the IP macro.  That macro can take two
   optional arguments: initial unindented text and an indent distance.
   The defaults are no unindented text and an indent distance of 3
   character spaces (0.3 inch).  Unindented paragraphs are possible via
   the LP macro.

5.3.4. Special Indentation

   Indentation may be controlled with RS and RE macros.  The RS macro
   will increase the indent level by the indentation increment of 3
   character spaces, while the RE macro will reduce indentation by that
   amount.

5.3.5. Keeps and Displays

   Sometimes one has lines of text or non-textual content which one
   would like to appear as a group, uninterrupted by page breaks.  Such
   a group is called a "keep" and is specified by preceding the group
   with the KS macro and following it with a KE macro.  In some cases,
   ordering of the output is flexible; a "floating" keep may be used
   (the output of the keep may appear after some text which follows the
   keep).  In that case, use the KF macro instead of KS to start the
   keep.  More complex groupings can be obtained by "displays".
   Displays are started like keeps, using the DS macro (there are no
   floating displays, but a display may be placed in a floating keep).
   Display content is not filled into paragraphs; output appears like
   the input lines except for indentation.  The DS macro takes an
   argument consisting of a single letter which identifies the type of
   display:

   Display Type                        Description
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        C         Each line of text is centered
        B         The input lines are read as a block, and the block is
                  centered
        L         The display is left-aligned
        I         The display is indented by the amount indicated by an
                  optional second argument (default is 3 character
                  spaces)

   Displays are typically used for block quoted material and for
   preventing page breaks within non-textual material such as tables and
   diagrams.  For example, the input:

.DS C
War is Peace
Freedom is Slavery
Ignorance is Strength
.\" Eric Arthur Blair, a.k.a. George Orwell
.DE

   produces output in which each line is centered:

                               War is Peace
                            Freedom is Slavery
                           Ignorance is Strength

   whereas the input:

.DS B
War can still settle problems,
but it can only settle them the wrong way. \" Bertrand Russell
.DE

   produces the text lines as a centered block:

                War can still settle problems,
                but it can only settle them the wrong way.

5.3.6. Lists

5.3.6.1. Numbered Lists

   The NL macro initializes a numbered list.  It takes three optional
   arguments:

   1. a prefix string.  The default is an empty string (no prefix).

   2. a one-character numbering format; one of

      1  number using Arabic numerals (the default)

      I  number using Roman numbers expressed as upper-case letters

      i  number using Roman numbers expressed as lower-case letters

      A  letter with upper-case letters

      a  letter with lower-case letters

   3. a suffix string.  The default is a period.

   Each list item after the initialization is introduced by the LI (list
   item) macro.  Text following the LI macro line is processed as an
   indented paragraph with the first line numbered.

   The most recently started list is terminated with the LE (list end)
   macro.

Internet Draft      Writing I-Ds and RFCs using troff       January 2005

   Lists may be nested up to 9 levels deep.  Each level of nesting is
   indented by the paragraph indent value (3 characters).  The list
   above has a variable list (see description below) inside a numbered
   list.

5.3.6.2. Bulleted Lists

   A bulleted list is initialized with the BL macro, which takes no
   arguments.  List items also use the LI macro and the LE macro ends a
   bulleted list.

   The input lines:

.BL
.LI
first bulleted item
.LI
second
bulleted item
.LE

   produce the output:

   o  first bulleted item

   o  second bulleted item

5.3.6.3. Variable Lists

   The VL macro initializes a variable list.  Each list item is labeled
   with a string supplied as an argument to that item's LI macro.  The
   LE macro terminates a variable list.

5.3.7. References

   Internet Drafts and RFCs contain two types of references: normative
   references and informative references.  Citations for the reference
   material appear near the end of the document and are indicated by a
   bracketed tag within the document text like this: [N1.RFC2223].
   Macros are provided to automatically number and format normative and
   informative references in the style used in this document.  The
   reference tags consist of the letter N (for normative references) or
   I (for informative references), followed by a sequential number
   within each series, optionally followed by a dot and a user-supplied
   string, supplied as an argument to the NR macro for normative
   references, IR for informative references.  A second argument may be
   supplied to save the generated reference tag in a named string; the
   second argument must be 2 characters suitable as the name of a
   string.  Internal string names used by the rfc macro package always
   begin with an upper-case letter; it is generally safe to use a
   two-character name that begins with a lower-case letter which is
   followed by an upper-case letter or a digit (troff internally has
   some strings which are named with two lower-case letters).  The first
   normative reference in this document was specified by the lines:

.NR RFC2223 r1
Postel, J. and J. Reynolds, "Instructions to RFC Authors", RFC\ 2223,
October 1997.
.NE

   For references to RFCs, one can simply copy and paste the text made
   available by the RFC Editor in the file rfc-ref.txt, as has been done
   in this example (the actual reference text was on a single input
   line, though that is not required, and the backslash preceding the
   space after "RFC" prevents lines being broken at that space, i.e.
   within the RFC document number).  The reference text follows the NR
   or IR macro line and will be suitably formatted and placed in the
   Normative References or Informative References section of the
   generated document.  The reference text is ended with an NE or IE
   macro.

   The bracketed reference appears in the text at the place where the
   NR/NE or IR/IE macros are placed, while the actual reference text is
   saved for output in unnumbered Normative References and Informative
   References sections.  No space appears after the bracketed reference,
   so a list of such references may appear with comma separators by
   simply placing a line containing a comma between reference macro
   groups.  If a bracketed reference appears at the end of a sentence,
   the period marking the end of the sentence is provided in the input
   after the NE or IE macro line.  However, a line beginning with a dot
   is normally interpreted as a directive; to prevent that, the line
   should begin with the two character sequence \& preceding the period.
   That sequence represents a zero-width non-printing space, which
   prevents interpretation of the line as a directive without affecting
   the appearance of the output.

   The reference tag (including the brackets) generated by the example
   above is saved in the troff string named r1, which can be used to
   refer to the same reference.  That reference tag can be made to
   subsequently appear in the document text via a reference to the saved
   troff string, viz. the character sequence \*(r1.

5.3.8. MIB modules, etc.

   When a MIB module or similar entity is defined and there is a
   limitation notice (via the ON macro), there may need to be a separate
   copyright notice placed in the part to be extracted per [N3.BCP78].
   The IB macro may be called at the appropriate section to generate the
   properly-formatted boilerplate text.  The mandatory first argument to
   the IB macro selects the type of statement from the ones permitted by
   [N3.BCP78], and the optional second argument permits specifying
   something other than "MIB module".  The types are:

   Type                               Text
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    1     Copyright(C)The Internet Society 2005.  This version of this
          MIB module is part of RFC XXXX; see the RFC itself for full
          legal notices.

   The correct year is used, and when an RFC number is assigned by the
   RFC Editor, the RFC number will appear in place of XXXX.  As noted
   above, alternate text may be substituted for "MIB module".

5.3.9. Document Appendices

   Appendices appear like numbered sections, except that the first-level
   consists of upper-case letters rather than numbers.  Each appendix to
   appear in the document should be introduced with the AP macro, which
   causes such numbering to take place.  The AP macro takes a single
   argument, the appendix heading text.  Subdivided sections within an
   appendix can be introduced with second-, third-level, etc. numbering
   via NH macros as with document body sections.

5.4. End Matter

   At the very end of the input file describing the document, the author
   should place an EM macro.  That causes output of references, author's
   address (or authors' addresses), and IPR boilerplate sections.  If a
   TC macro was provided at the beginning of the document input with a
   non-zero first argument, or if the document is more than 30 pages in
   length, a Table of Contents is also produced.

Internet Draft      Writing I-Ds and RFCs using troff       January 2005

Appendix A. Esoterica

A.1. Troff vs. Nroff

   RFCs and Internet Drafts are produced as text documents.  It is
   sometimes desirable to produce a formatted version for improved
   rendition of diagrams, etc.  The rfc macro package has been designed
   so that troff formatted output resembles the text version as closely
   as possible; it utilizes a monospaced font for text, does not
   embolden section headings (unlike the ms macro package), and centers
   each page within 8.5 by 11.0 inch page boundaries.  Other than
   improved appearance of non-textual matter, troff and nroff versions
   of documents produced with the rfc macro package should appear nearly
   identical after postprocessing, including page and line breaks.  One
   subtlety is that centered text with an odd number of characters is
   offset left or right in nroff output, whereas it is truly centered in
   troff output.  Output processed with nroff for text production
   includes a form feed character after each page (the "fix.pl" script
   specified in [N1.RFC2223] is not necessary); output processed by
   troff does not.

A.2. Postprocessing

   Scripts are available for use with the awk [I13.awk] interpreter for
   postprocessing of text and Postscript formatter output (primarily to
   reorder pages so that the Table of Contents appears in the correct
   location, although the postprocessor for text also removes
   overstriking).

Appendix B. Macros Specifically for the RFC Editor

   In addition to the NU, FN, UD, OB, IS, and CA macros discussed in the
   body of this memo, there are several macros intended for RFC Editor
   (rather than author) use.  They are described in this Appendix.

B.1. IESG Notes

   The IN macro takes a single numeric argument indicating the type of
   IESG note to be included; some types take a second argument:

   Type   2nd Argument                        Text
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    1     none            The IESG has not found any conflict between
                          this document and IETF work.
    2     Working Group   The IESG thinks that this work is related to
                          IETF work done in WG Working Group, but this
                          does not prevent publishing.
    3     Working Group   The IESG thinks that publication is harmful
                          to the IETF work done in WG Working Group and
                          recommends not publishing the document at
                          this time.

    4     Procedure       The IESG thinks that this document violates
                          IETF procedures for Procedure and should
                          therefore not be published without IETF
                          review and IESG approval.
    5     none            The IESG thinks that this document extends an
                          IETF protocol in a way that requires IETF
                          review and should therefore not be published
                          without IETF review and IESG approval.

                          considered by the IETF, and therefore it may
                          resemble a current IETF work in progress or a
                          published IETF work.  This RFC is not a
                          candidate for any level of Internet Standard.

   If a type of 0 (zero) is specified, text after the IN macro line is
   collected.  The RFC Editor can use this feature to incorporate an
   IESG notice other then the ones prescribed in [N3.BCP78] as listed in

   The IN macro should be placed in the front matter (before the first
   SH or NH macro).  The corresponding note will be formatted as an
   unnumbered section appearing before the Abstract.  If no IN macro
   call is placed in the front matter section, no IESG note will be
   included in the document.

B.2. Alternate Document Type and Number

   Some RFCs are also BCP, STD, or FYI documents.  The RFC Editor may
   indicate such a document type and number via the AN macro.  It takes
   two arguments; the type (which must be one of BCP, STD, or FYI) and
   the number corresponding to that type.  The information is placed in
   the first page heading, properly formatted.  The AN macro should also
   be placed in the front matter.
