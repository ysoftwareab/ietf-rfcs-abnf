<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>The use of Internet technologies for emergency calling creates
      opportunities for fraud, relative to traditional circuit-switched
      emergency calling. This document describes the context for IP-based
      emergency calling, and the types of fraud which are possible within the
      system. A mitigation strategy for fraud against voice service providers
      is described; techniques for detecting or preventing other types of
      fraud will be incorporated in this document as they are available.

Introduction</h3>

<p>Entities that participate in emergency calling (e.g., callers, voice
      networks, or emergency authorities) expose themselves to abuse by
      fraudulent parties. For example, when voice networks provide special
      service such as priority or preemption to emergency calls, fraudulent
      callers could mark non-emergency calls as emergency calls in order to
      receive special treatment. In the traditional, circuit-switched
      emergency calling system, the types of fraud that are technically
      feasible are very limited because the system is very rigid. The
      transition to a next-generation IP-based emergency calling system has
      the potential to broaden the spectrum of possible attacks. In order to
      prevent this, it is necessary to identify the specific fraud risks to
      which entities in IP-based emergency calling are exposed, and to enhance
      to the emergency calling system to address these risks. The first step
      in this process, an analysis of the structure of the emergency calling
      system from the perspective of fraud risk, is the subject of this
      document.
</p>
<p>This document discusses the fraud risks introduced by the transition
      from the current circuit-switched emergency calling architecture to
      next-generation, packet-switched emergency calling. After introducing
      some necessary terminology, we describe the different roles that
      entities play in the emergency calling process, and the types of fraud
      to which the entities playing those roles are exposed. As an example of
      one type of fraud mitigation, we describe a system for voice networks to
      verify that call signaling that appears to be for an emergency call is
      actually for an emergency call.

<a name="rfc.section.2"></a><h3>2.&nbsp;
Terminology</h3>

<p>Caller &ndash; The entity that initiates an emergency call. For
      purposes of this document, this term includes both the calling party
      (e.g., a person in distress or a vehicle that has been involved in a
      collision) and any hardware or software used to initiate the call.
</p>
<p>Voice Service Provider (VSP) - An entity that provides services that
      enable IP-based telephony. In the SIP context, a VSP might operate a set
      of proxies; in the 3GPP/IMS context, a VSP is an IMS network
      operator.
</p>
<p>Internet Service Provider (ISP) - An entity that provides
      connectivity to the Internet to its subscribers.
</p>
<p>Access Network - An ISP to which a network endpoint is physically
      attached. An access network will often also act as an LSP.
</p>
<p>Location Service Provider (LSP) - An entity that provides information
      about the location of Internet endpoints. In many cases, the LSP used to
      geolocate an endpoint will be the access network to which it is
      connected.
</p>
<p>Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) - An entity that receives
      emergency calls. Some PSAPs receive all calls from callers within a
      specified geographic area; others are dedicated to calls related to
      specific emergency services.
</p>
<p>Emergency Services Routing Proxy (ESRP) - A signaling entity that
      routes calls within the emergency services network. In particular, an
      ESRP is a part of the emergency services infrastructure, and not
      operated by a VSP.

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
Participants in IP-based emergency call establishment</h3>

<p>At a high level, there are four steps in emergency call
      establishment:</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>VSP or caller recognizes that a call is an emergency call and
          tags it with a service URN
</li>
<li>VSP or caller obtains location information from LSP, queries the
          LoST infrastructure to obtain the PSAP URI, and sends the call to
          this PSAP URI
</li>
<li>Call is routed through normal signaling channels (possibly via
          multiple VSPs) to the PSAP
</li>
<li>PSAP receives call and exchanges multimedia with caller
</li>
</ol><p>At the application layer (ignoring physical and network access
      providers), there are thus four types of entities that participate in
      this process: Callers, VSPs, LSPs, and PSAPs. (The LoST infrastructure
      is a background player, to be discussed below) The process of emergency
      call establishment in the SIP context is described in detail in <a class='info' href='#I.D-ietf-ecrit-framework'>[I.D&#8209;ietf&#8209;ecrit&#8209;framework]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosen, B., Schulzrinne, H., Polk, J., and A. Newton, &ldquo;Framework for Emergency Calling using Internet           Multimedia,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#I.D-ietf-ecrit-phonebcp'>[I.D&#8209;ietf&#8209;ecrit&#8209;phonebcp]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosen, B. and J. Polk, &ldquo;Best Current Practice for Communications Services in support           of Emergency Calling,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. The remainder of this section
      follows the general structure described in those documents, but is not
      necessarily specific to SIP calling.
</p>
<p>Callers and VSPs are responsible for recognizing calls as emergency
      calls and routing calls to the appropriate PSAPs. Once a caller or VSP
      recognizes that a call is an emergency call, it embeds in the call
      signaling a service URN to indicate the type of emergency service being
      requested. There are two steps in the routing of a call: First, the URN
      for the desired service is combined with information on the location of
      the caller in a query to the LoST infrastructure, which provides contact
      information for the appropriate PSAP for that service and location.
      Second, the call is directed to the PSAP via the normal routing
      mechanisms for the signaling protocol. In some cases, VSPs will be
      required to provide special services to signaling and/or media packets
      related to emergency calls. LSPs provide the location information that
      is used as an input to LoST in the call routing process. Frequently, the
      LSP used for emergency calling will be the access network to which the
      calling endpoint is physically connected, since this network naturally
      has a physical relationship to the endpoint which can be used to
      determine the endpoint&rsquo;s location. In other situations, the
      LSP&rsquo;s role may be played by a positioning function internal to a
      VSP network, or by an independent location server on which the
      endpoint&rsquo;s location has been previously stored. It is generally
      understood that location information will be provided without
      restriction to appropriate entities for emergency call routing purposes,
      even when the LSP might otherwise restrict access to that information
      (e.g., for business or privacy purposes).
</p>
<p>PSAPs are the recipients of emergency calls. They are responsible for
      answering emergency calls and using information provided via signaling
      or media to determine how best to respond to an emergency. Location
      information is a critical component of this decision. In many cases, the
      endpoint&rsquo;s location will be carried in the call signaling messages
      that initiate the emergency call, but the PSAP may also obtain location
      through other mechanisms. For example, the signaling may contain a
      reference to an LSP that is able to provide up-to-date information on
      the location of a mobile endpoint. PSAPs must also discriminate between
      calls that are genuine emergencies and calls that are not (while all
      calls are usually answered, callers who call without an emergency may be
      subject to subsequent investigation or prosecution).

Fraud risk in IP-based emergency calling</h3>

<p>Each type of entity described in Section 3 above puts valuable
      resources at risk by participating in the emergency call-establishment
      process. VSPs may give priority to emergency calls transiting their
      network, or allocate bandwidth for them. LSPs need to provide location,
      which they may be unwilling to give out (due to business or privacy
      reasons) in a non-emergency setting. PSAPs need to optimize their
      limited resources for responding to emergency calls. And, most
      importantly, emergency callers entrust their safety to the proper
      functioning of the emergency calling infrastructure. This section
      describes in more detail the requirements that each party has of the
      others, and discusses how these requirements can be violated by
      fraudulent actors. This section also briefly discusses how these threats
      may be addressed, but proposes no complete solutions. The LoST
      infrastructure is also a central, trusted component of the emergency
      calling system; we describe below certain assurances that emergency
      calling entities require of the LoST infrastructure.

<a name="rfc.section.4.1"></a><h3>4.1.&nbsp;
Callers</h3>

<p>Emergency callers generally have more to lose from a failed
        emergency call than other entities that participate in emergency call
        establishment, since they are by definition in distress. A
        caller&rsquo;s primary requirement is to be able to communicate with
        the appropriate PSAP for their emergency, and to receive any necessary
        emergency services. In order to receive the requested emergency
        services as quickly as possible, the caller must be directed to the
        PSAP that is responsible for the requested service in the
        caller&rsquo;s current location. This requires that the entity that
        does LoST routing (whether the caller or a VSP) have access to
        accurate, timely location, and that LoST routing be done correctly.
        Once the appropriate PSAP has been identified and contacted, there
        must be sufficient communications resources available for the caller
        and the PSAP to exchange any further necessary media or signaling
        traffic. The fraud risks faced by callers are thus:</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>LSPs that provide LoST routing entities with inaccurate
            location information, or no location information at all
</li>
<li>VSPs that mis-route emergency calls
</li>
<li>VSPs (or ISPs) that restrict the communications resources
            available for call traffic
</li>
</ol><p> Fortunately, these risks are all relatively improbable.
        Users often have business relationships with their LSPs, VSPs, and
        ISPs that oblige these service providers to provide reliable service.
        Additionally, these service providers are often subject to legal and
        regulatory requirements that they faithfully execute their roles in
        emergency calling.

VSPs</h3>

<p>By handling emergency calls, VSPs impose additional load on their
        infrastructure, and by providing priority to emergency call signaling
        or media traffic (or allocating bandwidth for it), they risk degrading
        the quality of service experienced by other users. In order to protect
        their infrastructure, VSPs require assurance that calls receiving
        special treatment as emergency calls are in fact emergency calls. That
        is, they require a reliable means for determining which calls are
        emergency calls.
</p>
<p>The primary fraud risk for VSPs is that callers will be able to
        obtain special treatment for non-emergency calls that is usually only
        provided to emergency calls, i.e., that non-emergency calls will be
        able to masquerade as emergency calls in order to get special
        treatment. VSPs thus require reliable mechanisms for verifying that a
        call is an emergency call. These mechanisms must be reliable in the
        sense that a call so verified will necessarily be delivered by the
        signaling system to a PSAP. An example of such a mechanism is
        described in Section 5 below.

<a name="rfc.section.4.3"></a><h3>4.3.&nbsp;
LSPs</h3>

<p>Location providers have the right to control access to the location
        information they hold. They may restrict access to location in order
        to protect users&rsquo; privacy, or they may do it in order to enable
        a pay-for-location business model. On the other hand, location
        providers in many jurisdictions have a legal or regulatory requirement
        to provide location information for the purpose of routing emergency
        calls or for directing emergency responders. The primary fraud that
        concerns an LSP is thus that an entity (a caller or VSP) that would
        not otherwise have access to location information will be able to
        obtain it by claiming to need it for emergency purposes. This problem
        is exacerbated by the fact that LSPs are generally unable to
        authenticate the entities (e.g. VSPs) that might request location
        information for LoST routing. This is because while LSPs tend to be
        physically local entities, serving a specific geographical area, VSPs
        can handle a call originated anywhere on the Internet. Thus it is not
        sufficient for an LSP to have relationships with VSPs in its local
        area, as the callers served by an LSP may use a VSP based in another
        country, or even on another continent.

<a name="rfc.section.4.4"></a><h3>4.4.&nbsp;
PSAPs</h3>

<p>PSAPs have limited resources to devote to answering emergency calls
        &ndash; in particular, they have a limited number of human
        call-takers. Many emergencies require emergency responders to be
        dispatched, often at significant cost. PSAPs need to optimize their
        limited resources, and ensure to the greatest extent possible that
        emergency responses are timely and appropriate to the emergency.
</p>
<p>The two most significant fraud risks to PSAPs are false emergency
        calls and false location information. A false emergency call is a call
        placed to a PSAP by a caller who is not in distress. In the current
        system, these are often prank calls or inadvertently placed calls. In
        the Internet context, there is a much larger risk that PSAPs will
        receive a high volume of such false calls, as the process of making a
        false call can be more easily automated. A high volume of false calls
        can exhaust the limited resources of the PSAP, causing legitimate
        calls not to be answered, therefore false calls can be used as a
        denial of service attack against the PSAP and legitimate emergency
        callers.
</p>
<p>Likewise, false location information is location information that
        points to something other than the location of an ongoing emergency.
        If a PSAP dispatches first responders based on false location, then
        these responders may not be available to respond to actual
        emergencies. While false calls can by definition only be launched by
        fraudulent callers, false location information can be provided by
        either callers or LSPs (possibly in collusion with each other).
</p>
<p>The cost of not responding to a legitamate emergency call is
        obviously quite high, and so PSAPs generally respond to all emergency
        calls. Thus, a mechanism for discriminating false calls from
        legitimate calls is not useful (unless it can be clearly proven not to
        identify legitimate calls as false ones). Mechanisms that provide
        reliable information for forensic analysis are preferable, for
        instance mechanisms that reliably identifying callers for subsequent
        investigation or prosecution.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is essential to determine whether location
        information has been falsified before emergency responders are
        dispatched. This is a more tractable problem: Since PSAPs and LSPs are
        both inherently local entities, with well-defined geographical
        coverage areas, PSAPs will likely be able to establish trust
        relationships with LSPs that serve the same geographical area as the
        PSAP. These trust relationships can be used together with Internet
        security technologies to prove that location objects originated from a
        trusted LSP.

<a name="rfc.section.4.5"></a><h3>4.5.&nbsp;
Requirements of the LoST Infrastructure</h3>

<p>The proper functioning of the emergency calling system depends on
        the LoST infrastructure having three critical properties: </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Accuracy. Information returned by LoST queries is trusted by
            all parties to be an accurate reflection of current PSAP
            assignments.
</li>
<li>Completeness. A URI belongs to an emergency services entity if,
            and only if, it is returned in a LoST response from an
            authoritative LoST server.
</li>
<li>Uniformity. If two different entities both submit the same
            query (within a reasonable period of time), then both queries will
            return the same results.
</li>
</ol><p>The LoST mapping architecture as specified in <a class='info' href='#I.D-ietf-ecrit-mapping-arch'>[I.D&#8209;ietf&#8209;ecrit&#8209;mapping&#8209;arch]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., &ldquo;Location-to-URI Mapping Architecture and Framework,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> mostly satisfies these
        requirements. However, there may be limited cases in which it does
        not, primarily due to territorial disputes or incomplete deployment.
        The latter can be expected to improve as the LoST infrastructure is
        more completely deployed; the former is likely to be long-term
        issue.
</p>
<p>The accuracy assumption is necessary for the emergency calling
        system to function at all: If the LoST infrastructure is not trusted
        then there are much more serious problems than user fraud. (In
        particular, an attacker could redirect all emergency calls in an area
        to an attacker controlled fake PSAP.) The completeness and uniformity
        assumptions mean that the LoST infrastructure can be used to
        authenticate PSAP URIs. In the absence of an authentication
        infrastructure for PSAPs, verifying that a URI is returned by a LoST
        query is a convenient mechanism that provides reasonable assurance
        that a given URI is a PSAP URI. The completeness and uniformity
        assumptions may not be valid in the early stages of the deployment of
        the LoST infrastructure. In particular, a VSP may receive a different
        answer to a LoST query than the end device (or another LoST routing
        entity) because either (A) the LoST forest-guide system is incomplete
        and the VSP's LoST resolver is unable to identify the authoritative
        tree for a given location; or (B) the location is in a contested
        region, there are two trees that claim to be authoritative for this
        region, and the VSP and the device disagree as to which tree has a
        legitimate claim to represent the region.
</p>
<p>Fortunately, once the mapping infrastructure is fully deployed (as
        described in <a class='info' href='#I.D-ietf-ecrit-mapping-arch'>[I.D&#8209;ietf&#8209;ecrit&#8209;mapping&#8209;arch]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., &ldquo;Location-to-URI Mapping Architecture and Framework,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>) it
        should be very rare for a VSP to fail to locate the authoritative tree
        for a given location. In the meantime, one possible strategy to
        mitigate this problem is for the device to include in the signaling
        the &lt;source&gt; element from the LoST response. In such a case, if
        the VSP fails to locate an authoritative tree for a given location, it
        can extract the authoritative LoST server from the &lt;source&gt;
        element in the signaling traffic and query that server to verify that
        URI belongs to an emergency services entity. Even when the LoST
        infrastructure is fully deployed, there will likely always be
        territorial disputes that result in two distinct trees claiming to be
        authoritative for a given region. However, in most such cases, it is
        likely that a user will select a VSP that agrees with him as to who
        legitimately controls a given region. In situations where a user
        disagrees with his VSP as to which tree is authoritative for a given
        region, then the VSP will likely not give special consideration to
        calls destined for a PSAP it deems illegitimate (even if the user
        deems the PSAP to be legitimate). There can be no technical solution
        that resolves such a dispute. (For example, it is unlikely that a
        Israeli VSP will give special treatment to a call destined for a
        Palestinian PSAP in a contested territory, no matter what protocol
        specifications we might produce.)

Mitigating Fraud against VSPs</h3>

<p>One type of fraud that can reasonably be mitigated is fraud against
      VSPs, in which callers are able to obtain special services usually
      reserved for emergency calls by crafting non-emergency calls that look
      like emergency calls. In this section, we describe a mechanism to
      mitigate this fraud. Although we describe our solution here in terms of
      SIP signaling, the same technique could be adapted to other signaling
      protocols with appropriate semantics.

<a name="rfc.section.5.1"></a><h3>5.1.&nbsp;
Problem Statement</h3>

<p>In the case of the signaling network, fraud occurs when a call is
        placed to a non-emergency services entity, but signaling elements
        (e.g. SIP Proxies) believe that that the call is an emergency call. In
        particular, consider a VSP that provides special preference to
        emergency calls (e.g. emergency calls are free of charge, or are given
        high priority access to signaling elements). If a malicious user of
        such a VSP is able to cause calls to an arbitrary recipient to be
        treated as emergency calls, then the user could fraudulently gain
        access to VSP resources. Clearly this is a situation the VSP wishes to
        avoid.
</p>
<p>Note that in this document, we are not concerned with non-emergency
        calls to emergency services entities. Although such calls are also
        fraudulent, they (1) are very difficult to detect; and (2) have a very
        limited impact on VSP resource consumption, since they may only be
        placed to emergency services entities.
</p>
<p>This system verifies that a call is an emergency call in the sense
        that it is structured as an emergency call described in <a class='info' href='#I.D-ietf-ecrit-phonebcp'>[I.D&#8209;ietf&#8209;ecrit&#8209;phonebcp]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosen, B. and J. Polk, &ldquo;Best Current Practice for Communications Services in support           of Emergency Calling,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>, and it is directed to a PSAP
        URI. The structural verification is performed simply be examining the
        contents of the SIP INVITE message. Verifying that a given URI is a
        PSAP URI is done via a LoST query, so this mechanism depends heavily
        on the above-listed assumptions about the LoST infrastructure. If LoST
        information can be manipulated by an attacker, then he can thwart this
        verification procedure by making any URI look like a PSAP URI. If
        there are PSAPs who are not listed in the LoST infrastructure, then
        this system will not be able to verify that their URIs are PSAP URIs,
        and will not regard calls to them as emergency calls. And if different
        entities receive different answers to the same query, then there is a
        risk that the entity that the query that is used to verify the PSAP
        URI will return a different result than the one used to find the PSAP
        URI in the first place.

<a name="rfc.section.5.2"></a><h3>5.2.&nbsp;
Risk at different stages of emergency calling</h3>

<p>Recall that in the ECRIT framework for emergency calling, there are
        three distinct stages of an emergency call. The three stages and their
        corresponding markings are listed below:</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>The call has not been recognized as an emergency call (and has
            therefore has also not been routed). <br />
<br />
The
            Request-URI of the call contains a Dial String URI.
</li>
<li>The call has been recognized as an emergency call but has not
            been routed.<br />
<br />
The Request-URI of the call
            contains an appropriate emergency services URN.
</li>
<li>The call has been recognized as an emergency call and has been
            routed via the LoST protocol.<br />
<br />
The
            Request-URI of the call contains an appropriate emergency services
            URN and the Route header contains the URI of PSAP.
</li>
</ol><p>Note that in the context of fraud targeting the VSP, there is
        only risk of fraud when the VSP receives a call in the third of these
        stages.
</p>
<p>When a VSP receives a call in the first stage, it will attempt to
        recognize the dial string as a valid emergency dial string. If the
        recognition is successful it will process the call as it would process
        a second-stage call and thus there is no opportunity for fraud.
</p>
<p>When a VSP receives a call in the second stage, the VSP will make a
        LoST query (which will return a valid PSAP URI) and the VSP will
        proceed to route the call to this URI. Therefore, there is no
        opportunity for fraud.
</p>
<p>The possibility of fraud only exists when the VSP receives a call
        in the third stage. In such a case, the URI in the route header may or
        may not be a valid PSAP URI returned by LoST query. Therefore, to
        prevent fraud against the VSP it suffices to ensure that a VSP can
        verify that the URI in the route header of a third-stage call is a
        valid PSAP URI returned by a LoST query. Note that this problem is
        tractable becuase in order for a VSP to receive a third-stage call,
        some upstream signaling entity must possess location information of
        sufficient precision for use with LoST, and this location can be used
        by the VSP (in conjunction with the LoST infrastructure) to verify the
        validity of the URI in the Route header. A mechanism for performing
        such verification is described in the next section.

<a name="rfc.section.5.3"></a><h3>5.3.&nbsp;
A verification mechanism</h3>

<p>Here we propose a signaling mechanism for emergency calls that have
        been recognized and routed (see Section 5.2) that allows a VSP to
        verification that the URI in the Route header is a valid PSAP URI
        (returned by a LoST query).
</p>
<p>Note that we are not proposing that VSPs reject emergency calls
        that fail verification (or are not marked using this mechanism).
        Instead the failure of verification or the absence of this mechanism
        may be used as an indication of possible fraud. Further (forensic)
        analysis may be necessary to determine that fraud did indeed occur.
        Nonetheless, this mechanism should be useful to detect large scale
        fraud and take appropriate action.
</p>
<p>In describing our mechanism, we distinguish the following two
        cases: (1) the emergency call is routed by the calling device; and (2)
        the emergency call is routed by a SIP proxy. These two cases differ
        slightly in the actions perfromed by the entity who does the call
        routing. However, the verification procedure performed by the VSP is
        identical in both cases.
</p>
<p>When the emergency call is routed by the calling device, if the
        calling device has access to its location, then it MUST include its
        location (either by value or by reference) in a geolocation header
        <a class='info' href='#I.D-ietf-sip-location-conveyance'>[I.D&#8209;ietf&#8209;sip&#8209;location&#8209;conveyance]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Polk, J. and B. Rosen, &ldquo;Location Conveyance for the Session Initiation           Protocol,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> in the SIP
        INVITE used to initiate the emergency call. This geolocation header
        must include the &ldquo;used-for-routing&rdquo; parameter. If the
        calling device does not have access to its location, then it must
        include the PSAP service area boundary (returned by LoST) in the body
        of the SIP INVITE. This boundary must be referenced by a SIP
        geolocation header and that header must contain the
        &ldquo;used-for-routing&rdquo; parameter.
</p>
<p>When the emergency call is routed by a SIP proxy, if the calling
        device&rsquo;s location is already present in the SIP INVITE, then the
        proxy must add the &ldquo;used-for-routing&rdquo; parameter to the
        appropriate geolocation header. If the calling device&rsquo;s location
        is not present in the SIP INVITE, then the proxy must add a
        geolocation header containing either a reference to the device&rsquo;s
        location, or else a reference to the PSAP service area boundary
        (returned by LoST). This geolocation header must include the
        &ldquo;used-for-routing&rdquo; parameter. This reference must be able
        to be dereferenced by any entity on the public internet. If the SIP
        proxy possesses an appropriate, universally-dereferencable reference
        to the device's location or the PSAP service area boundary, it may use
        this reference in the geolocation header. However, if the SIP proxy
        does not possess an appropriate reference, then it must create a new
        reference to either the location of the calling device or the service
        boundary of the PSAP. Note that this requires the SIP proxy (or
        another machine in the domain of the SIP proxy) to maintain state for
        the lifetime of this newly created location reference (which should
        not be less than several minutes). This introduces the possibility of
        a denial of service attack against the SIP proxy in which an entities
        served by the SIP proxy make a large number of emergency calls to
        exhaust the storage available for maintaining such reference bindings.
        Therefore, it is recommended that the SIP proxy creates references to
        PSAP service boundaries and not device locations, since these service
        bondary references can be reused whenever the SiP proxy routes
        multiple calls to the same PSAP. 
</p>
<p>We now describe the actions taken to verify that a (previously
        recognized and routed) emergency call is being routed to a valid PSAP
        URI. Upon receiving a SIP INVITE for such a call, the VSP does the
        following: </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Examine the Request-URI header to obtain a service URN. If the
            Request-URI header does not contain a service URN then
            verification fails. (Note that service URNs act as universal
            identifiers for emergency calls, and any call that has been
            recognized as an emergency call must be tagged with a service URN
            in the Request-URI header <a class='info' href='#I.D-ietf-ecrit-phonebcp'>[I.D&#8209;ietf&#8209;ecrit&#8209;phonebcp]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosen, B. and J. Polk, &ldquo;Best Current Practice for Communications Services in support           of Emergency Calling,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.)
</li>
<li>Examine the SIP headers and attempt to find a geolocation
            header containing the &ldquo;used-for-routing&rdquo; parameter. If
            such a geolocation header does not exist then verification
            fails.
</li>
<li>If the geolocation header contains a location reference,
            attempt to dereference the reference to obtain a location object.
            If the deference fails then verification fails. Otherwise, if the
            location is included by-value then obtain the location object from
            the body of the SIP message.
</li>
<li>If the location object is a point, then make a LoST query using
            that point and the service URN from the Request-URI header to
            obtain a PSAP URI. If the location object is a service boundary,
            then make a LoST query using an arbitrary point within the
            boundary and the URN from the Request-URI header to obtain a PSAP
            URI.
</li>
<li>Compare the PSAP URI obtained from the LoST query to the URI in
            the Route header. If the two URIs do not match, then verification
            fails. If the two URIs do match, then verification succeeds.
</li>
