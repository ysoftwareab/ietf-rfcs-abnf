                                Abstract

     This document defines a printer industry standard SNMP MIB for the
     management of printer finishing device subunits.  The finishing
     device subunits applicable to this MIB are an integral part of the
     Printer System.  This MIB does not apply to a Finisher Device that
     is external to a Printer System.

     The Finisher MIB is defined as an extension of the Printer MIB
     [PrtMIB] and it is expected that the information defined in this
     document will be incorporated into a future update of the Printer
     MIB.

1.0  INTRODUCTION

This document describes an SNMP Management Information Base (MIB) to
provide for the management of in-line post-processing in a fashion that
is currently provided for printers, using the Printer MIB [PrtMIB].  The
Printer Finishing MIB includes the following features:

   - Provides the status of the finishing device.
   - Manages the features and configuration of the finishing device.
   - Enables and disables the finishing operations.
   - Allows unsolicited status from the finishing device.


1.1  Scope

This document provides a robust set of finishing devices, features, and
functions, based upon today's state of the art of in-line finishing.
Since finishing typically accompanies higher speed network printers and
copiers, in contrast to simple desktop devices, no attempt is made to
limit the scope to "bare minimum".  On the other hand, the Printer
Finishing MIB does not duplicate the production mail preparation, custom
insertion, franking, and reprints that are covered by the DMTF Large
Mailing Operations standard [LMO].

Information supplied by the Printer Finishing MIB may be utilized by
printer and finisher management applications engaged in monitoring
status and managing configuration, and also used by print and finishing
submission applications which are engaged in:

   - print-file-level finishing operations that are applied to a
     complete print file,

   - document-level finishing operations that are applied individually
     to each document in the print file,

   - document-level finishing operations that are applied to a selected
     document in the print file.

INTERNET-DRAFT         Printer Finishing MIB           February 19, 1998




Note that not all combinations of finishing operations are compatible.
Compatible combinations of finishing operations are device specific.


1.2  Rational

The Printer MIB [PrtMIB] is now successfully deployed in a large segment
of the network printer market.  SNMP and/or HTTP enabled printers and
software management applications are growing in numbers.

There is an increase in the availability of network printers and copiers
that include in-line finishing operations.  Thus a well defined and
ordered set of finishing objects is now necessary for printer
management.

The printer model defined in the Printer MIB includes finishing
operations and the MIB was designed to later incorporate finisher
objects or to be referenced by a future Finisher MIB.



2.0  TERMINOLOGY

Where appropriate, the Printer Finishing MIB will conform to the
terminology, syntax, and semantics from the DMTF Large Mailing
Operations standard [LMO], the Internet Printing Protocol [IPP], and/or
the ISO Document Printing Application [DPA].

Finisher Input:  An input tray on the finisher and not otherwise
associated with the printer.  An example of a finisher input is a tray
that holds finishing "inserts".

Finisher Output:  The output of the finisher.  Because processing is in-
line, the finisher outputs are a direct extension of the set of printer
outputs.

Finishing Operation Axis:  Defined by DPA as the axis to which some
finishing operations are applied to or referenced from.  An example is
the axis for a fold operation.

Finishing Axis Offset:  The offset from a finishing operation axis at
which the finishing operation takes place or is applied.

3.0  FINISHER SUBUNITS INTEGRATED INTO THE PRINTER MODEL:

The Printer Finisher Device subunits receive media from one or more
Printer Media Path subunits and deliver the media to one or more Printer
Output subunits after the completion of the finishing operations.  The
Printer Model, as described in the Printer MIB [PRTMIB], is modified
adding the finisher subunit(s) and finisher supplies as follows:

       An attribute table entry is used, rather than unique
       objects, to minimize the number of MIB objects and to
       allow for expansion without the addition of MIB objects.
       Each finisher device is represented by a separate row
       in the device subunit attribute table."
