Abstract

   ROUTING ARCHITECT'S WARNING: flagrant IPv4 site multihoming practices
   cause a significant increase the routing table size, change rates and
   instability, the tragedy of the commons by encouraging selfish
   routing practices, the exhaustion of the 16-bit AS number space, and
   may collapse the Internet interdomain routing architecture.

   As there has been a desire to avoid similar problems as seen with
   IPv4, the use of similar techniques to achieve site multihoming has
   been prevented operationally in IPv6.  However, the long effort to
   proceed with other IPv6 multihoming mechanisms has produced lots of
   heat but little light.  This memo tries to list available techniques,
   split the organizations to different types to separately examine
   their multihoming needs, to look at the immediate and short-term
   solutions for these organization types, and to list a few immediate
   action items on how to proceed with IPv6 site multihoming.

1. Introduction

   Currently in IPv4, there seem to be three-four main mechanisms which
   are used to achieve at least some of the multihoming benefits:
   obtaining their own address space and AS number and advertising
   those, advertising more specific routes with a different path, using
   multi-connecting and leveraging NAT.

   In IPv6, the first two of IPv4 mechanisms which are considered
   architecturally unscalable have been operationally prevented for now
   and the fourth does not exist.

   IPv6 site multihoming effort has been in progress for many years
   already, with little light but lots of heat.  This memo tries to
   increase the light, and show a few possible ways how to proceed with
   site multihoming in a relatively qualitative fashion.

   First, the multihoming mechanisms which have been proposed and
   briefly considered are listed for reference; a more detailed
   description and analysis is omitted [SMULTI].

   Then, a classification of sites and their multihoming motivations is
   presented.  This is done to break the "site" and "multihoming"
   concepts to smaller, digestible pieces.

   After that, the multihoming mechanisms are classified to immediate,
   short-term, and long-term approaches; long-term approaches are
   ignored when describing which techniques might fit for each
   organization type.

   Last, some short term issues to be addressed and things to be done,
   are listed.

   [V4MULTI] describes IPv4 multihoming properties.  The motivations
   section seems to be missing an important factor, the explicit desire
   for operator-independence.  This is described in Appendix A.
   Similarly, multi-connecting -- which has typically been considered
   out of scope -- is briefly described in Appendix B.

2. Site Multihoming Mechanisms

   In [SMULTI], quite a few different site multihoming mechanisms have
   been briefly described and analyzed:

     o Transport solutions, including TCP modifications [TCP+] and SCTP
       [SCTP],

     o Locator/Identifier separation solutions, including HIP [HIP],
       LIN6 [LIN6] and Mobile IPv6 [MIPv6]),

     o Host-centric Multihoming [HC],

     o Multihoming at Site Exit Routers [SITEEXIT],

     o Geographic Address Allocation [GEO],

     o Provider Independent Addressing Derived from AS Numbers [ASNPI],

Internet Draft     draft-savola-multi6-nowwhat-00.txt         April 2003


     o Multi-connecting (see Appendix B for introduction), and

     o Other methods, including: Advertising more specific routes
       [SPECIFIC], Multihoming with route aggregation [RAGGR], End-to-
       end multihoming [END2END], Traffic steering using routing header,
       Router renumbering [RR], and MHAP [MHAP].

   A degree of familiarity with at least the most important techiques is
   assumed.  The description and further analysis is out of scope.

3. Classification of Sites and Motivations

   The different types of organizations are separated, and their
   possible motivations explored separately.  In this way, it's possible
   to try to break the big "site" and "multihoming" concepts into
   smaller pieces.

   First, a rough classification is presented, and then each of the four
   types are described at more length.

   Analysis on which methods could suit each type best are described in
   the next section.

3.1. Classification

   A table of multihoming motivations and types of sites is created; it
   is shown in the table below.

                        .--------------.------------.--------------.
                        | Independence | Redundancy | Load sharing |
         .--------------+--------------+------------+--------------+
         |Minimal       |      no      |     no     |      no      |
         |Small         |    maybe     |    maybe   |      no      |
         |Large         |  maybe/yes   |     yes    |     maybe    |
         |International |     yes      |     yes    |      yes     |
         '--------------'--------------'------------'--------------'

   Note that the motivations "Performance" and "Policy" [V4MULTI] are
   not included above: in practice, they do not seem to be prime
   motivators, and it is difficult to gauge how desirable features they
   are.

   The term "IP-users" is used in the classifications below.  This is
   used to loosely refer to those people who have an operational need
   for Internet access to get their work done.

   The organizations are classified roughly in four categories:




Savola                   [Expires October 2003]                 [Page 4]

Internet Draft     draft-savola-multi6-nowwhat-00.txt         April 2003


      1. Minimal: a very small or restricted end-site, for example a
         typical home network, or a small office of less than 10 IP-
         users,

      2. Small: a small-to-mid-size enterprise, for example with less
         than 50-150 IP-users,

      3. Large: a large enterprise, for example a regional or national
         enterprise of typically less than 1000 IP-users, and

      4. International: a large or very large enterprise, with a
         significant amount of international activity.

   The distinction between the last two comes from the assumption that
   an international organization is assumed to have major activity in
   multiple countries or regions: in practice, one with a separate
   significant Internet connectivity with different ISPs in many areas.
   Naturally, even smaller organizations are likely to have some
   relatively minor international activity, but these are not likely
   counted as International.

   Now, the reasons and motivations specific to each organization class
   are described.  These give a bit more elaboration on why the
   categories were written down as they were.

3.1.1. Minimal

   Very minimal end-sites, such as typical home networks or very small
   enterprises, are quite small and typically do not include mission-
   critical activities.

   Naturally, anyone would be willing to achieve multihoming benefits,
   but usually the associated costs, e.g. caused by obtaining physical
   connectivity to two ISPs, do not justify it.

   In the very rare case that some multihoming is required, it can be
   done using the "Small" model.


3.1.2. Small

   Small end-sites are typically small-to-mid-size enterprises, which
   operate mainly in one geographical location; branch offices are also
   possible, but these are typically handled using Virtual Private
   Networks (VPNs) or similar.

   Small end-sites typically use the Internet in such a manner that they
   might find redundancy and independence important, depending on the



Savola                   [Expires October 2003]                 [Page 5]

Internet Draft     draft-savola-multi6-nowwhat-00.txt         April 2003


   costs and complexity.  However, typically an outage of some minutes
   or rarely even hours is not yet critical, and due to the size,
   operator-independence is not vital.


3.1.3. Large

   Large end-sites are typically largish enterprises which operate in
   one or typically more geographical locations, however, mostly inside
   a region or a country.  Relatively minor international branch offices
   are possible, but there are no major internal, private interconnects
   -- physical or link-layer connectivity that does not go through the
   Internet -- to the offices in other countries.  Typically, if there
   are multiple locations inside a region, there are internal, private
   interconnects between the locations.

   Redundancy is very important due to increased size: longer outages
   are unacceptable for productivity.  Also, as the number of the nodes
   in the site is quite high, the effort of renumbering is also high,
   and some level of operator independence valuable but not always
   strictly necessary if significant enough ISPs operate in the area.
   Only in some relatively rare cases the network capacities or other
   parameters are exceeded so that some form of load-sharing is
   required.


3.1.4. International

   International end-sites are typically large or very large enterprises
   which have significant employment internationally, connect to the
   Internet with high-speed links in each of these significant locations
   and may often have internal, private interconnects in place.

   Typically, ISPs are not global enough to supply connectivity to all
   the locations, and being locked to scenic routing paths caused by
   only a few regional ISPs is not considered a serious option.

   As the international enterprise typically exceeds the geographic and
   topological scope of any single ISP, and the network is so large,
   operator independence is considered extremely important.  Redundancy
   is also critical.  The required capacities and usage patterns may
   vary a lot, but often also some form of load sharing is necessary:
   all the traffic to the end-site cannot go through a single location,
   and it might not be reasonable either, due to geography.

4. Choosing a Multihoming Mechanism

   In the previous section organizations were split into four main
   classifications; now it's possible to summarize the mechanisms and
   see if particular mechanisms could be made to meet the organizations'
   needs.

   The first thing to realize is that the scope and breadth of
   multihoming motivations and requirements vary a lot.  It is highly
   unlikely that an "one size fits all" solution could be found: indeed,
   it seems fruitless to even try to look for one except possibly in
   purely research terms. Further, generic solutions are not probable to
   be found without larger architectural changes.

   Therefore, by applying some rough classification one can hope to
   break the problem space into pieces and try to evaluate whether
   applicable solutions can be found for those pieces.

4.1. Viable Multihoming Mechanisms

   First, it is important to take a look at and analyze different
   solutions to see which mechanisms could be viable and how they could
   be positioned.

   A detailed analysis is omitted from this memo.

   These are grouped to three categories: immediate, short-, and long-
   term.  The definitions of the latter two are intentionally left
   vague, but short term solutions should not take more than 1-3 years
   to implement and deploy, at most.

4.1.1. Immediate Approaches

   Multi-connecting seems to be the only obvious way to work around
   multihoming problems right now.

   Host-centric multihoming and multihoming at site exit routers would
   also be applicable -- to an extent -- immediately, if no ISP would
   implement ingress filtering.

4.1.2. Short-term Approaches

   Host-centric IPv6 multihoming and multihoming at site-exit routers,
   fully fleshed out, are both short-term solutions; both still need
   some work.

   Provider independent addressing based on AS numbers is a short-term
   solution; the same applies to advertising more specific routes, if



Savola                   [Expires October 2003]                 [Page 7]

Internet Draft     draft-savola-multi6-nowwhat-00.txt         April 2003


   done from specific allocations to make them distinguishable.

   Parts of multihoming with route aggregation, traffic steering using
   routing header and router renumbering could be used in the short
   term, but the mechanisms themselves are not usable.

4.1.3. Long Term Approaches

   All transport solutions are only generally applicable in the long
   term, if at all.

   Identifier and locator separation solutions are long-term solutions;
   HIP the most credible of them all.  LIN6 has fundamental issues which
   does not make it globally deployable.  Mobile IPv6, if the address
   ownership and key management issue could be worked around, could be a
   short-term solution, a "hack".  Architecturally, it seems a bit ill-
   fit as a long-term solution.

   Geographic address allocation is a long-term solution if it's
   considered viable.

   End-to-end multihoming is a long-term solution; it requires some
   major changes in thinking, and may be difficult to accept.

   MHAP is a long-term solution; it moves into an area where most do not
   want to go architecturally, and it's likely it could not be made to
   work in practice.

4.1.4. Conclusion on Approaches

   In the following analysis, none of the long-term approaches are
   seriously considered; they all need much more work to be adoptable.

   Of the long-term solutions, it seems likely that at least identifier
   and locator solutions will prevail in some form or another.  However,
   they do not solve the whole multihoming problem themselves.

4.2. Applicable Mechanisms for Site Types

   Now, the mechanisms outlined in the multihoming analysis and
   considered viable, above, are applied to the rough end-site
   organization categories above.









Savola                   [Expires October 2003]                 [Page 8]

Internet Draft     draft-savola-multi6-nowwhat-00.txt         April 2003


4.2.1. Minimal

   Minimal end-sites do not seem to require a multihoming mechanism.  Of
   course, some would still find one preferable.

   If they would, one building on "host-centric multihoming" approach
   would seem sufficient; this might not even be all too expensive using
   e.g. multiple xDSL connections.

4.2.2. Small

   Small end-sites might find a multihoming mechanism desirable for
   redundancy and independence reasons.

   The possible approaches are three-fold:

     o multi-connecting to one ISP, if redundancy is important,

     o host-centric multihoming, if independence is important, or

     o multihoming at site exit routers, if both are important.

   Multi-connecting or multihoming at site exit routers provide a very
   extensive amount of redundancy and convergence; independence is
   obtained by connecting to multiple ISPs and deploying IP addresses
   from those, which would make the renumbering much less of a problem
   if it had to be done.

   Solving the multihoming problem of small end-sites with an approach
   like "ASN-PI" or more specific routes is unscalable.

4.2.3. Large

   Large end-sites typically require redundancy and possibly
   independence, sometimes desiring load sharing as well.

   Often, the same mechanisms applied to small end-sites will also
   provide the sufficient level of redundancy and independence for also
   large end-sites.

   One might be able to handle the scalability issues associated with
   approaches like "ASN-PI" with large end-sites, but such mechanisms
   should be avoided.

Internet Draft     draft-savola-multi6-nowwhat-00.txt         April 2003


4.2.4. International

   International end-sites typically require redundancy, independence,
   and load sharing.

   As their geographical scope typically exceed ISPs', assigning
   addresses from multiple ISPs, as with previous approaches, would lead
   to suboptimal routing.

   One approach would be to depend on a change of the IP addressing and
   routing model: each significant international part of the
   organization would obtain separate IP address assignments from the
   local ISPs, and use an appropriate multihoming mechanism with that --
   probably like with large end-sites above -- and interconnect the
   offices using mechanisms like VPN's; not even trying to obtain a
   homogeneous address space for all of the company.

   This would be a "divide-and-conquer" approach to the problem: break
   it to smaller pieces and solve them independently.

   If this approach can't be adopted, it seems the only realistic model
   would be to use something like "ASN-PI", more specific routes or
   separate address allocations, or similar.

5. Issues to Be Addressed

   Now, a few relatively short-term action items are presented which
   should be done as soon as possible.

     o Update and finish documenting IPv4 multihoming practices
       [V4MULTI],

     o Further than that, try to gain a better understanding why certain
       multihoming mechanisms are used with IPv4,

     o Finish documenting the IPv6 multihoming goals [GOALS],

     o Realize that certain problems like connection survivability may
       not be strict requirements in all cases of site multihoming, and
       that such problems could be worked around.

     o Create a roadmap on how to proceed with multihoming solutions,

     o Work on short-term solutions, in particular, fix [SITEEXIT] and
       [HC] in the case that ISPs use ingress filtering and consider the
       case when uplink MTU is not higher than the one used within the
       site when using [SITEEXIT],

Internet Draft     draft-savola-multi6-nowwhat-00.txt         April 2003


     o Work on procedures to ensure the separation -- who is
       "privileged" for which solution -- between different site types
       and multihoming methods, if different techniques are necessary,
       and

     o Start documenting how to do renumbering, and how to make
       renumbering easier; the renumbering doesn't have to work
       perfectly or even well, as long as it is satisfactory for some
       uses.

6. Acknowledgements

   Most of the ideas on how to proceed originated in 2002 and in the
   beginning of 2003.  The ideas on how to proceed were discussed prior
   to IETF56 in March 2003 with Tim Chown and Kurt Erik Lindqvist.

7. Security Considerations

   This memo summarizes issues in IPv6 site multihoming and gives ideas
   on the way forward.  Many multihoming techniques have security
   considerations which are not to be forgotten; they should be dealt
   with in the respective specifications and remembered when analyzing
   their applicability.  Security is also an integral issue to consider
   when considering the overall site multihoming landscape.  However, in
   itself, this memo does not present any security considerations.

A. Independence as a Multihoming Reason

   This is an excerpt from [SMULTI].

   Technical reasons for independence are mostly covered under
   redundancy; independence here focuses on economic, political and
   administrative perspectives.

   Multihoming, especially with your own addresses can bring the
   organization some degree of provider independence.  If the
   organization can just change its ISP's with minimal effort, one
   undoubtedly has a better standing in the service agreement
   negotiations, e.g.  being able to get a cheaper price and requested
   service agreement duration.  ISP's could also just disappear, but in
   most cases services usually continue uninterrupted in the event of
   bankruptcy, mergers, etc.  Also, especially some larger organizations
   consider it important to stand on their own, so that they can't be
   seen to depend on others.

   An important factor for many, especially bigger sites, is also that
   the renumbering in the event of a network service provider change is
   considered too difficult and time-consuming, and it is desirable to
   find mechanisms which do not require that; such feature is provided
   by independence.

B. Multi-connecting

   This is an excerpt from [SMULTI].

   Multi-connecting means connecting multiple times to a single ISP.  By
   some definition [V4MULTI], multi-connecting is not considered a
   multihoming mechanism. However, it still deserves a brief
   description.

   Multi-connecting is typically achieved by having multiple site border
   routers and connecting each of them to separate routers at the ISP,
   usually in different locations.

   Often, a routing protocol is run between the site and the ISP, to be
   able to quickly detect errors in the connectivity and to switch to
   alternative paths.  Routing protocol used is often BGP with private

   AS numbers.

   Sometimes, typically when the ISP is also in charge of the management
   of site border routers, some other protocols such as OSPF or IS-IS
   are also possible -- this often requires strict filtering of
   advertisements at the ISP end, to prevent compromising the ISP's core
   routing system.  In some cases, simply static routes may also be
   possible; typically this requires a link-layer medium which provides
   notifications if the end-to-end link-layer path becomes
   nonoperational.

   Multi-connection is a flexible mechanism and relatively easy to
   accomplish: it requires no coordination between ISPs, no address
   applications for provider independent address space, no AS number
   applications for BGP AS numbers or the like.  Yet it provides
   protection from the most common set of problems.

   If one link fails, the changes do not need to be propagated further
   than the ISP; therefore, this is a very scalable approach when
   considering the global routing table.
