Abstract

   This document define a new form of name, called permanent 
   identifier, that may be included in the subjectAltName extension 
   of a public key certificate issued to an entity.

   The permanent identifier is an optional feature that may be used 
   by a CA to indicate that the certificate relates to the same 
   entity even if the name or the affiliation of that entity stored 
   in the subject or another name form in the subjectAltName extension 
   has changed.

   The subject name, carried in the subject field, is only unique 
   for each subject entity certified by the one CA as defined by the 
   issuer name field. Also, the new name form can carry a 
   name that is unique for each subject entity certified by a CA.

1  Introduction

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

   This specification is one part of a family of standards for the 
   X.509 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for the Internet. It is based 
   on RFC 3280, which defines underlying certificate formats and 
   semantics needed for a full implementation of this standard.

   The subject field of a public key certificate identifies the entity 
   associated with the public key stored in the subject public key 
   field. Names and identities of a subject may be carried in the 
   subject field and/or the subjectAltName extension. Where subject 
   field is non-empty, it MUST contain an X.500 distinguished 
   name (DN). The DN MUST be unique for each subject entity certified 
   by a single CA as defined by the issuer name field.

   The subject name changes whenever any of the components of that 
   name gets changed. There are several reasons for such a change to 
   happen.

         For employees of a company or organization, the person may get 
         a different position within the same company and thus will 
         move from one organization unit to another one. Including the 
         organization unit in the name may however be very useful to 
         allow the relying parties (RPÆs) using that certificate to 
         identify the right individual.

         For citizens, an individual may change their name by legal 
         processes, especially women as a result of marriage.

         Any certificate subject identified by geographical location may
         relocate and change at least some of the location attributes 
         (e.g. country name, state or province, locality, or street).

   A permanent identifier may be useful in two contexts: access 
   control and non-repudiation.

         For access control, the permanent identifier may be used in 
         an ACL (Access Control List) instead of the DN or any other 
         form of name and would not need to be changed, even if the 
         subject name of the entity changes.

         For non-repudiation, the permanent identifier may be used to 
         link different transactions to the same entity, even when 
         the subject name of the entity changes.

   When two certificates from different CA's contain both the same 
   permanent identifier value and the same type of permanent 
   identifier from a given Assigner Authority, then these 
   certificates relate to the same entity, whatever the content of 
   the DN or other subjectAltName components may be.

2. Definition of a Permanent Identifier

   A CA which includes a permanent identifier in a certificate is 
   certifying that any public key certificate containing that 
   identifier refers to the same entity, whatever the content of 
   the DN or other subjectAltName components may be.

   The use of a permanent identifier is OPTIONAL. This name is 
   defined as a form of otherName from the GeneralName structure in 
   SubjectAltName. The permanent identifier is defined as follows:

   id-on-permanentIdentifier   AttributeType ::= { id-on 3 }

     PermanentIdentifier ::=     SEQUENCE {
        identifierValue              IdentifierValue,
        identifierType               IdentifierType OPTIONAL,
        matchingRule        [0]      IMPLICIT OBJECT IDENTIFIER OPTIONAL
     }

     IdentifierValue ::= CHOICE {
            iA5String            IA5String,
            uTF8String           UTF8String
     }

     IdentifierType ::= CHOICE {
            registeredOID                   OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
            uniformResourceIdentifier       IA5String
     }

   The IdentifierValue supports two syntaxes: IA5String or UTF8String.
   IA5String is variable length data of ASCII octets. UTF8String is 
   variable length data of octets. UTF-8 is an ASCII-preserving 
   encoding method for Unicode (ISO 10646), the Universal Character Set 
   (UCS). The UCS allows to support most of the world's writing systems 
   using a single character set.

   The IdentifierType field, when present, identifies both the 
   organization responsible for assigning the content of the identifier 
   field and the type of that field.

   When the IdentifierType field is missing, then it is assumed that 
   the organization responsible for assigning the content of the 
   identifier field is the CA itself and that there is only one type 
   of such identifier for the CA.

   The IdentifierType field may contain either:

           a) an Object Identifier (i.e. an OID), or
           b) a permanent URI using IA5String.

   Characteristically, when an OID is used, the prefix of the OID 
   identifies the organization, and a suffix is used to identify the 
   type of permanent identifier being identified. Essentially the 
   same thing is true of URIÆs.

Pinkas, Gindin                                                 [ Page 3]


Permanent Identifier                Document Expiration:   December 2002


   Note: the full arc of the object identifier used to identify the 
   permanent identifier name form is derived using:

     id-pkix OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) identified-organization(3) 
        dod(6) internet(1) security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) }

     id-on OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pkix 8 }   -- other name forms

   If identifierType is missing, then the permanent identifier is 
   locally unique to the CA.

   If identifierType is present, then the permanent identifier is 
   globally unique among all CAs.

   The matchingRule is an OID. When the OID is missing the 
   following matching rule SHALL be used:

      The Alphanumeric Identifier Match rule compares for equality a
      presented value with an attribute value of type UTF8String 
      or IA5String, which is interpreted as a series of alphanumeric 
      characters.  The rules for matching are that a working comparison 
      value is constructed from each of the two values by stripping all 
      control characters, spaces, and punctuation marks; and then the 
      two comparison values are compared using CaseIgnoreMatch.

   Note: other matching rules can be used (see in chapter 6 of X.520). 
   Two such examples are:

     caseIgnoreMatch {2 5 13 2} defined in section 6.1.1 of X.520, and 
     caseExactMatch  {2 5 13 5} defined in section 6.1.4 of X.520.

3. Security considerations

   A given entity may have at an instant of time or at different 
   instants of time multiple forms of identities. 

   If the permanent identifier is locally unique to the CA (i.e. 
   identifierType is not present), then two certificates from the 
   same CA can be compared. When they contain two identical permanent 
   identifiers, then a relying party may determine that they refer to 
   the same entity.

   If the permanent identifier is globally unique among all CAs (i.e. 
   identifierType is present), then two certificates from different 
   CAs can be compared. When they contain two identical permanent 
   identifiers, then a relying party may determine that they refer to 
   the same entity.

   The permanent identifier identifies the entity, irrespective of any 
   attribute extension. When a public key certificate contains 
   attribute extensions, the permanent identifier, if present, should 
   not be used for access control purposes but only for audit purposes. 
   The reason is that since these attributes may change, access could 

Pinkas, Gindin                                                 [ Page 4]


Permanent Identifier                Document Expiration:   December 2002


   be granted on attributes that were originally present in a 
   certificate issued to that entity but are no more present in the 
   current certificate.

   The content and the format of the IdentifierValue is defined by the 
   Assigner Authority. An Assigner Authority who wishes to permit 
   IdentifierValues to be matched using a matching rule different from 
   the one specified in this document would be required to specify a 
   matching rule. Many such matching rules are specified in ITU-T X.520.

   Subject names in certificates are chosen by the issuing CA and are 
   mandated to be unique for each CA; so there can be no name collision 
   between subject names from the same CA. These names may be an 
   end-entity name, when the certificate is a leaf certificate or a 
   CA name, when it is a CA certificate.

   Since a name is only unique towards its superior CA, unless some 
   naming constraints are being used, a name would only be guaranteed 
   to be globally unique when considered to include a sequence of all 
   the names of the superior CAs.  Thus, two certificates which contain 
   a permanent identifier extension without a identifierType may have 
   their permanent identifier extensions compared for equality either 
   by comparing the public key values of the two CAs which have issued 
   these two certificates or by comparing the sequence of CA names in 
   the certification path from the trust anchor to the CA, inclusive.

   The certification of different CAs with the same DN by different 
   CAs has other negative consequences in various parts of the PKI, 
   notably rendering the IssuerAndSerialNumber structure in RFC 2630 
   section 5.3 ambiguous.

B. OID's for organizations

In order to obtain an OID for an identifier type, organizations need 
first to have a registered OID for themselves (or must use a permanent 
URI). In some cases, OID's are provided for free. In other cases a 
one-time fee is required. The main difference lies in the nature of 
the information that is collected at the time of registration and how 
this information is verified for its accuracy.

B.1. Using IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)

The application form for a Private Enterprise Number in the IANA's 
OID list is: http://www.iana.org/cgi-bin/enterprise.pl. 

Currently IANA assigns numbers for free. The IANA-registered Private 
Enterprises prefix is: iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprise 
(1.3.6.1.4.1)

These numbers are used, among other things, for defining private 
SNMP MIBs.

The official assignments under this OID are stored in the IANA file 
"enterprise-numbers" available at: 
ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/enterprise-numbers

B.2. Using an ISO member body

ISO has defined the OID structure in a such a way so that every ISO 
member-body has its own unique OID. Then every ISO member-body is free 
to allocate its own arc space below. 

Organizations and enterprises may contact the ISO member-body where 
their organization or enterprise is established to obtain an 
organization/enterprise OID.

Currently, ISO members do not assign organization/enterprise OID's for 
free. 

Most of them do not publish registries of such OID's which they have 
assigned, sometimes restricting the access to registered organizations 
or preferring to charge inquirers for the assignee of an OID on a 
per-inquiry basis. The use of OID's from an ISO member organization 
which does not publish such a registry may impose extra costs on the 
CA that needs to make sure that the OID corresponds to the registered 
organization.

As an example, AFNOR (Association Francaise de Normalisation - the 
French organization that is a member of ISO) has defined an arc to 
allocate OID's for companies: 

{iso (1) member-body (2) fr (250) type-org (1) organisation (n)}
