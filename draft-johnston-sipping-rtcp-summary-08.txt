Internet-Draft   SIP Event for Service Quality Reporting    October 2005


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a new SIP event package, vq-rtcpxr, and a new
   MIME type, application/vq-rtcpxr, that enable the collection and
   reporting of metrics that measure quality for RTP [3] sessions.  The
   definitions of the metrics used in the event package are based on
   RTCP Extended Reports [4] and RTCP [3].  Monitoring of voice quality
   is believed to be the highest priority for usage of this mechanism
   and as such, the metrics in the event package are largely tailored
   for voice quality measurement.  However, the event package defined
   herein is designed to be extensible.  The event package explicitly
   provides parameters for reporting both the local and remote versions
   of these statistics.  Note that in multi-party calls, multiple
   reports will need to be generated either one for each endpoint or one
   for each session.  Configuration of usage of the event package is not
   covered in this document.  The event package can be used either with
   the SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY methods or the PUBLISH method.  Message flow
   examples for both mechanims are provided in this document.


2.  SIP Events Approach

   This document defines a new SIP events package [6].  The intended
   methods to use for this event are PUBLISH and SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY.  A
   SIP UA can provide voice quality reports using either of these
   methods to an entity which can make the information available to
   other applications.


3.  Use of PUBLISH Method

   A SIP UA that supports this specification may send the service
   quality metric reports using the PUBLISH method.  An application
   wishing to access this performance data maintains a State Agent for
   the vq-rtcpxr event package.  The Request-URI of the PUBLISH method
   is set to the address of the resource for the VoIP application.  The
   PUBLISH message is sent to the normal default outbound proxy server
   of the SIP UA or could be sent to other interested parties.

   The use of PUBLISH by this event is unique in that it does not
   require a soft or hard state to be maintained by either the Event
   Publication Agent (EPA) or the Event State Compositor (ESC).
   Futhermore the information that is presented by the vq-rtcpxr event
   in a PUBLISH request is not expected to have an expiration, rather,
   the information is associated with the timestamps in the event
   itself.  The primary intention of using PUBLISH for this event is
   reduction of transaction processing.

   A concern over the usage of the PUBLISH method is potential
   overloading of servers receiving the events, particularly in the
   threshold reporting model.  There are many approaches to solving this
   type of problem, but clearly the EPA's needs to adhere to some
   guidelines to reduce the probability of causing this overload
   condition.  Some suggested solutions are: a) limit sending of one
   threshold report per metric per session b) limit sending of one
   threshold report per session regardless of the metric c) limit
   sending a new threshold report to when a metric state has been
   sustained for a reasonable amount of time such as 20-30 seconds.


4.  Event Package Formal Definition

4.1.  Event Package Name

   This document defines a SIP Event Package as defined in RFC 3265 [2].
   The event-package token name for this package is:

   "vq-rtcpxr"

4.2.  Event Package Parameters

   No event package parameters are defined.

4.3.  SUBSCRIBE Bodies

   No SUBSCRIBE bodies are described by this specification.

4.4.  Subscription Duration

   Subscriptions to this event package MAY range from minutes to weeks.
   Subscriptions in hours or days are more typical and are RECOMMENDED.
   The default subscription duration for this event package is one hour.

4.5.  NOTIFY Bodies

   There are three notify bodies: a session report, an interval session
   report, and a alert report.

   The session report is used for end of session reporting.  This can be
   generated when a voice media session terminates or when a media
   change occurs, such as a codec change or a session forks.  This
   report is intended to allow cumulative metric reporting.  The session
   reports will populate the metrics with values that are measured over
   the interval explicitly defined by the "start" and "stop" timestamps.

   The interval report is used for periodic or interval reporting.  This

Internet-Draft   SIP Event for Service Quality Reporting    October 2005


   report is intended to capture short duration metric reporting.
   Interval reports will populate the metrics with values that are
   measured over the interval explicitly defined by the "start" and
   "stop" timestamps.

   The threshold report is used when voice quality degrades during a
   session.  The session report parameters are also included in the
   alert report to provide all of the necessary diagnostic information.
   Like the interval report, the metrics in the threshold reports will
   be populated with values that are measured over the interval
   explicitly defined by the "start" and "stop" timestamps.

   This specification defines a new MIME type application/vq-rtcpxr
   which is a text encoding of the RTCP and RTCP-XR statistics, along
   with some additional metrics and correlation information.

4.6.  Voice Quality Event Syntax

   This section describes the syntax extensions required for event
   publication in SIP.  The formal syntax definitions described in this
   section are expressed in the Augmented BNF format used in SIP [2],
   and contains references to elements defined therein.  Note that most
   of the parameters are optional.  In practice, most implementations
   will send a subset of the parameters.  It is not the intention of
   this document to define what parameters may or may not be useful for
   monitoring the quality of a voice session, but to enable reporting of
   voice quality.  As such, the syntax allows the implementer to choose
   which metrics are most appropriate for their solution.  Additionally,
   the authors recognize that implementers may need to add new parameter
   lines to the reports and new metrics to the existing parameter lines.
   The extension tokens are intended to fulfill this need.

      This alert indicates that the quality of the call in progress, as calculated
      using the Listening Quality transmission rating R , has degraded to an
      unacceptable level.  For futher troubleshooting of the problem, all metrics
      are populated, including the remote values which were obtained via RTCP XR [4]
      in the endpoints..


4.8.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a new SIP Event Package and a new MIME type.

4.8.1.  SIP Event Package Registration

      Package name: vq-rtcpxr

      Type: package

      Contact: Alan Johnston <alan.johnston@mci.com>

      Published Specification: This document

Internet-Draft   SIP Event for Service Quality Reporting    October 2005


4.8.2.  application/vq-rtcp-xr MIME Registration

      MIME media type name: application

      MIME subtype name: vq-rtcpxr

      Mandatory parameters: none

      Optional parameters: none

      Encoding considerations: text

      Security considerations: See next section.

      Interoperability considerations: none.

      Published specification: This document.


      Applications which use this media type: This document type is
           being used in notifications of VoIP quality reports.

      Additional Information:

           Magic Number: None

           File Extension: None

           Macintosh file type code: "TEXT"

      Personal and email address for further information: Alan Johnston
        <alan.johnston@mci.com>

      Intended usage: COMMON

      Author/Change controller: The IETF.

4.9.  Security Considerations

   RTCP reports can contain sensitive information since they can provide
   information about the nature and duration of a session established
   between two endpoints.  As a result, any third party wishing to
   obtain this information should be properly authenticated and the
   information transferred securely.

4.10.  Updates since -07

   - Significant syntax change -- made to align with typical SIP syntax.

   Parameter lines now separate tag from value with colon and individual
   parameters separate tag from value with equals.

   - Clean up of examples based on comments.

4.11.  Updates since -06

   - Changed package name from "svcqual" to "vq-rtcpxr" as the focus
   will be only voice quality reporting based on RTCP XR.

   - Rewrite of verbage in document to clarify that the focus will be
   voice quality reporting and not general performance or service
   quality reporting.

   - Removed section on "Why SNMP is not appropriate" as it was
   inaccurate and misleading.

   - Removed usage of SDP lines for describing the basic session
   parameters.  A reduced format designed specifically for this document
   is provided instead.

   - General clean up of syntax based on comments from WG

   - Removed general description of parameters, instead referring to
   RTCP XR for more details in most cases.

   - Reworked message flow examples using new syntax.

4.12.  Updates since -04

   - Changed package name from "perfrpt" to "svcqual"

4.13.  Updates since -03

   - Removed discussion of alternative mechanisms

   - Changed from NOTIFY transport to PUBLISH transport.

   - Changed package name from "rtcp-xr" to "perfrpt"

   - Corrected call flows.

   - Minor updates to message body format.

   - Added IANA registration for perfrpt SIP Event Package and
   application/rtcp-xr MIME registration.

   - Added more discussion for motivation and reasons why SNMP is not
