1.  Introduction

   The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) provides a way for clients
   to create and update objects in a central repository.  Usually, the
   commands that a client sends to a server will have been initiated
   upon request of a human being.  As a result, occasionally a command
   is sent which contains an error.

   EPP clients have some options to remedy such mistakes: for example,
   they can send a <delete> command to delete an object created in error
   (and may receive a refund if they do so within some grace period),
   cancel a previous <transfer> request, or send an <update> command to
   amend the properties of an object.

   However, there are some circumstances where it is not possible to
   correct an error by using an existing command.  For example, clients
   may inadvertently send multiple <renew> commands (because their
   implementation queries the server for a domain's expiry date, thereby
   defeating the idempotency measures built into EPP) or specify an
   incorrect period (e.g. a two-year renewal which should have only been
   for one year).

   As another example, a client may perform an <update> command on an
   object, but keep no record of the previous state of the object,
   preventing them from correcting the error.

   None of the mistakes in the examples above can be fixed using the
   existing EPP command repertoire.  The extension described in this
   document attempts to provide an additional remedy for such cases, by
   providing a way for a client to request that a previous command be
   reversed.  In order to reverse a command, the client need only record
   the <svTRID> returned by the server in its response to the command.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   XML is case sensitive.  Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
   and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
   character case presented in order to develop a conforming
   implementation.

   "reverse" is used as an abbreviation for
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:reverse-0.1".  The XML namespace prefix
   "reverse" is used, but implementations MUST NOT depend on it and
   instead employ a proper namespace-aware XML parser and serializer to
   interpret and output the XML documents.

   (Note to RFC Editor: remove the following paragraph before
   publication as an RFC.)

   The XML namespace prefix above contains a version number,
   specifically "0.1".  This version number will increment with
   successive versions of this document, and will reach 1.0 if and when
   this document is published as an RFC.  This permits clients to
   distinguish which version of the extension a server has implemented.

2.  Extension Elements

   This specification provides a new EPP command, called <reverse>.  As
   the set of EPP command verbs cannot be updated without updating the
   core EPP specifications, this command is implemented as an extension.

   When a client wants to reverse a previous command, it sends an EPP
   command frame containing only an <extension> element.  The
   <extension> element contains a <reverse> element, which in turn
   contains the details of the command the client wishes to reverse.
   The <reverse> element has the following child elements:

      An OPTIONAL <reason> element which contains a human-readable
      explanation of why the client is submitting the request.  The
      server MAY require inclusion of a <reason> element depending on
      its own policy.

      A <trID> element which uniquely identifies the command that the
      client wishes to reverse.  The <trID> element is derived from the
      element of the same name in [RFC5730].

Internet-Draft     Command Reversal Extension for EPP      November 2015


      An OPTIONAL <clTRID> element that uniquely identifies this command
      to the server.

   Example <reverse> request frame:

   C: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   C: <epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
   C:   <extension>
   C:     <reverse:reverse
   C:       xmlns:reverse="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:reverse-0.1">
   C:       <reverse:reason>Reversing an accidental
   C:       double renewal.</reverse:reason>
   C:       <reverse:trID>
   C:         <reverse:clTRID>ABC-10001</reverse:clTRID>
   C:         <reverse:svTRID>54321-XYZ</reverse:svTRID>
   C:       </reverse:trID>
   C:       <reverse:clTRID>ABC-12345</reverse:clTRID>
   C:     </reverse:reverse>
   C:   </extension>
   C: </epp>

3.  Server Handling of Reverse Commands

   Which commands a server will accept <reverse> commands for is a
   matter of server policy (which server operators should provide to
   client operators).  If a server acceps a <reverse> command, it MUST
   respond with a 1000 or 1001 result code.  If the server returns a
   1001 response, the client MUST be notified of outcome of the offline
   process via the EPP message queue.  If the server rejects the
   command, it MUST respond with a 2400 result code.

   Servers MUST NOT allow a client to reverse a command that it did not
   originally submit.  Servers SHOULD implement policies that flag
   <reverse> commands for offline processing where changes might have
   security implications (such as those which would remove client-
   assigned status codes, alter authorisation information or add or
   remove secDNS [RFC5910] records, etc).

   Servers MUST reject a command which attempts to reverse a <reverse>
   command.

4.  EPP <poll> command

   Servers which return 1001 response codes to <reverse> commands MUST
   notify clients of the outcome of the out-of-band process via the EPP
   message queue.  The format of the <poll> message is as follows.

Internet-Draft     Command Reversal Extension for EPP      November 2015


   The <resData> element of the <poll> response contains a <panData>
   element which contains a <paTRID> element.  This element contains an
   OPTIONAL <clTRID> and a <svTRID> which together identify the
   <reverse> command submitted by the client.  The <paTRID> element has
   a MANDATORY "paResult" element which is a boolean, and which
   indicates the outcome of the offline review.

   The <msg> element contains a human-readable message describing the
   outcome of the review.

   Example of a <poll> message:

   C: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="no"?>
   C: <epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
   C:   <response>
   C:     <result code="1301">
   C:       <msg>Command completed successfully; ack to dequeue</msg>
   C:     </result>
   C:     <msgQ count="5" id="12345">
   C:       <qDate>2016-04-04T22:01:00.0Z</qDate>
   C:       <msg>Pending action completed successfully.</msg>
   C:     </msgQ>
   C:     <resData>
   C:       <reverse:panData
   C:         xmlns:reverse="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:reverse-0.1">
   C:         <reverse:paTRID paResult="1">
   C:           <reverse:clTRID>ABC-12345</reverse:clTRID>
   C:           <reverse:svTRID>54321-XYZ</reverse:svTRID>
   C:         </reverse:paTRID>
   C:         <reverse:paDate>2016-04-04T22:00:00.0Z</reverse:paDate>
   C:       </reverse:panData>
   C:     </resData>
   C:     <trID>
   C:       <clTRID>BCD-23456</clTRID>
   C:       <svTRID>65432-WXY</svTRID>
   C:     </trID>
   C:   </response>
   C: </epp>

5.  Formal Syntax

   An EPP object mapping is specified in XML Schema notation.  The
   formal syntax presented here is a complete schema representation of
   the object mapping suitable for automated validation of EPP XML
   instances.
