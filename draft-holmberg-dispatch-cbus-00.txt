1.  Introduction

   Various OMA service enablers need to be able to retrieve a list of
   addresses (URIs), where the users associated with the URIs fulfil
   certain conditions.  User information is evaluated against the
   conditions, and the matches form a URI list.

   The need for the functionality originates from the OMA PoC service.
   However, there is ongoing work in OMA to define a common mechanism,
   called CBUS enabler [OMA-RD-CBUS-V1_0-20090203-C], to provide the
   functionality, so that it can be used for various types of services
   (e.g. messaging, gaming, conferencing and advertisement).

   The CBUS enabler provides the following functions:

   - Support for requestor initiated condition-based URIs selection
   requests.

   - Administration of conditions for URI selection.

   - Interaction with other enablers for retrieval of individual user's
   information (e.g. presence information, location information).

   - Evaluation of conditions and selection of matching individual users
   based on one time evaluation.

   - Re-evaluation of conditions and re-selection of matching individual
   users based on monitoring.

   - Aggregation of one-time evaluation results and monitoring results
   from different information sources.

   - Notification of evaluation results to requestor.

   The conditions may be based on user information which changes over
   time (e.g. presence information or geographical location), but they
   can also be based on more static user information (e.g. hobbies or
   personal interests).

   The entity which acts as requester, and provides the conditions to be
   used for the user information evaluation, is called CBUS client.  The
   CBUS client usually resides on the user equipment, or an application
   server, which supports the CBUS enabler.

   The selection of URIs, based on the provided conditions, may be
   performed by taking a snapshot, i.e. by making a one-time evaluation
   of the user information to find out whether the conditions are
   fulfilled or not.  The URI selection may also be performed by

   continous monitoring of the user information.

   This specification defines CBUS requirements for the SIP interface
   between the CBUS Client and the CBUS Server, based on the
   requirements in "Condition Based URIs Selection Requirements" [OMA-
   RD-CBUS-V1_0-20090203-C].

   The CBUS client actions triggered by the received URI list, and the
   interactions between the CBUS server and other enablers, are outside
   the scope of this specification.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].


3.  Terminology

   Candidate URI: An identifiable entity that is an input URI to the
   CBUS Server for URIs selection (e.g. group identity or individual
   user address).

   Condition: One of a set of expressions that must be matched in order
   for a URI to be selected.

   Evaluation information: The set of user information relevant for the
   evaluation of CBUS Conditions (e.g. presence information, location
   information).

   Evaluation parameter: A setting that controls the evaluation of
   conditions by the CBUS Server (e.g. one-time evaluation, periodical
   evaluation, the interval between re-evaluation).

   Reference URI: An identifiable entity that is designated as a
   reference for comparing the corresponding evaluation information with
   all candidate URIs during the evaluation.

   Selected URI = An identifiable entity that matches the conditions and
   is an output URI from the CBUS server.

4.1.  General

   This chapter shows different types of URI selections supported by
   CBUS.

4.2.  URI selection based on simple conditions

   The provided conditions require evaluation of users based on user
   information from a single information source.

4.3.  URI selection based on combined conditions

   The provided conditions require evaluation of users based on user
   information from multiple information sources.

4.4.  URI selection using candidate URIs

   The requestor provides, in addition to the conditions, a list of
   candidate URIs.  Evaluation will be done only against the users
   represented by the candidate URIs.

4.5.  URI selection using search

   The requestor does not provide a list of candidate URIs.

4.6.  URI selection using reference URI

   The requestor provides conditions and a reference URI.  The
   evaluation will be done against the reference URI.


5.  Use-case examples

   Alice has a number of friends.  Each friend has an address
   represented by a URI.  Alice is walking in the city, and figures out
   that there is an interesting exhibition at the city art museum.
   Alice wants to know if any of her friends are also in the city, and
   would like to join her to the museum, and uses the CBUS service to
   retrieve a list of URIs representing friends that may want to join
   her.

   Alice triggers a CBUS subscription.  The subscription contains
   candidate URIs, representing her friends, and two conditions: a
   geographical condition that the friend has to be in the city, and a
   hobby condition that the friend has to be interested in art.

   The CBUS server contacts a location enabler, and an enabler which
   contains hobbies and interests of persons, using the received

Internet-Draft                    EPDG                          May 2009


   geographical condition as input to location enabler and the received
   hobby condition as input to the enabler containing hobbies.  By
   evaluating the information received from the enablers the CBUS server
   detects a match for Bob: Bob is in the city, and he is interested in
   art.  The CBUS server sends a notification to Alice, which contains
   Bob's URI.  Alice then contacts Bob and asks whether he wants to join
   her to the museum.


6.  Requirements

6.1.  General

6.2.  CBUS Client Requirements

   REQ C.1: The CBUS Client SHALL be able to subscribe to a list of
   matching URIs based on conditions, a list of candidate URIs and a set
   of evaluation parameters provided by the CBUS client.

   REQ C.2: The CBUS Client SHALL be able to subscribe to and receive
   notifications about changes to the list of matching URIs.

   REQ C.3: The CBUS Client SHALL be able to provide stand-alone
   condition or a combination of conditions.

   NOTE: A combination can be based on a combination of e.g. presence
   information, location information and user profile information.

   REQ C.4: The CBUS Client SHALL be able to provide a list of candidate
   URIs, from which the matching URIs are to be selected.

   REQ C.5: The CBUS Client SHALL be able to specify the following types
   of evaluation, which indicate when the CBUS server shall notify the
   requestor about evaluation results: one-time evaluation result,
   periodic evaluation result and evaluation result due to change of
   evaluation information.

   REQ C.6: The CBUS Client SHALL be able to specify the duration of the
   subscription.

   REQ C.7: The CBUS Client SHALL be able to specify the time interval
   between evaluations of conditions, if periodic re-evaluation is
   requested.

Internet-Draft                    EPDG                          May 2009


   the selection request.

   NOTE: A reference URI can be used to select URIs that compared to the
   reference URI match certain conditions, e.g. are located within a
   radius of 500 m from the location of a user identified by the
   reference URI.

   REQ C.10: The CBUS Client SHALL be able to request the CBUS related
   capabilities of the CBUS server, e.g. the types of evaluation
   information supported and type of evaluations supported.

   candidate URIs to an ongoing subscription to evaluation results.

6.3.  CBUS Server Requirements

   REQ S.1: The CBUS server SHALL be able to notify the requestor with a
   list of matching URIs based on input provided by the CBUS client.

   NOTE: See the CBUS client requirements for the type of information
   which can be provided by the CBUS client.

   REQ S.2: The CBUS server SHALL be able to perform the following types
   of evaluation of candidate URIs: one-time evaluation, periodic re-
   evaluation and re-evaluation at change of evaluation information.

   REQ S.3: The CBUS server SHALL be able to limit a list of matching
   URIs where the requested maximum number of URIs have been exceeded.

   NOTE: How the CBUS server determines which URIs to include when the
   number of matching URIs is larger than requested is out of scope of
   this specification.

   REQ S.4: The CBUS server SHALL be able to suppress notifications of
   matching URIs, if the number of matching URIs is less than the
   minimum number of matching URIs requested.

   REQ S.5: The CBUS server SHALL be able to add and remove candidate
   URIs to an ongoing subscription.
