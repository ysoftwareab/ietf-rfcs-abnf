1. Introduction

   DSN[1],the abbreviation of Distributed Services Network, is a new
   question being standardized in ITU-T proposed by China Mobile. [2]
   outlines the DSN Architecture. As described in [2], DSN can support
   many applications, such as Multimedia telephony services, Streaming
   services, Content distribution service and so on.

   DSN VoIP system is designed based on the theory of DSN and P2PSIP.
   According to [1], DSN VoIP system includes two layers over IP network:
   P2PSIP layer and application layer. Application layer uses SIP
   protocol for call and P2PSIP layer uses RELOAD[3] protocol for
   routing calls in Overlay.

   It also introduces some key problems in P2P VoIP system and the
   corresponding requirements in this document. Then we introduce the
   system architecture, components and key technologies. At last we do
   some measurement and simulation experiments for validating system.

2. Requirements and key problems of carrier grade P2P VoIP system

2.1. Requirements

   Peer-to-Peer(P2P) systems have been widely applied in current
   internet, due to their advantages such as high scalability and
   costeffectiveness. Many P2P applications have been proposed to
   implement the traditional telecom voice service(for example, IMS or
   softswitch) such as Skype. But it's seldom discussed how to make P2P
   system meet the telecom infrastructure performance requirements,
   which is usually called as the "Carrier Grade" requirements.
   According to the current performance of telecom voice service
   deployments, the requirements of the carrier-grade services can be
   summarized but not limited to those listed below:

   1. Qos guarantee: Current IMS requires that any client-side
      operations should be able to get the final responses in 300
      milliseconds. So P2P VoIP system must guarantee the signaling
      response time is comparable to this time and the media
      transmission time is less than 400ms. There also are some
      specifications for voice quality.

Internet-Draft               p2psip bcp                     March 2010


   2. High Availability: The high availability includes network
      availability, service availability, and subscriber data
      availability and so on. The most common practice is to use some
      special mechanisms to acquire robustness and availability such as
      hot backup redundancy. High availability is a severe challenge for
      P2P VoIP systems which intends to achieve the same level of the
      telecom systems.

   3. Scalability: The P2P VoIP system must be adapted to the expanding
      of the system scale, such as the increasing of the number of the
      clients or core nodes.

   4. Load balance: The resource is distributed among P2P nodes and each
      node must collaborate with one another to void the emergence of
      the centralization of resource and traffic.

   5. Cost-effectiveness: It's the aim that the P2P VoIP system can
      achieve the same performance as the telecom commercial system by
      fully utilizing just commodity PCs, not using the costly hardware.

   6. Maintainability: it's quite appealing that it needs to do a little
      work to configure the nodes and network in order to maintain the
      natural operation of the P2P VoIP system. P2P VoIP system can
      realize the self-organization even after any network failure, so
      as to reduce the demand for emergent response and well experienced
      operators.

   7. Others: TBD.

2.2. Some Key problems

   To obtain the same performance as the telecom system, there are many
   key problems to be settled. Some of them are listed as below:

   1. Routing performance: The traditional P2P routing performance is
      relative to the network dimensions. The routing performance will
      be sharply descends as the increase of the network dimensions, for
      example, the traditional Chord routing performance is O(logN).

   2. Redundant traffic: The P2P network does not match with the
      underlying network, so the P2P nodes forward the traffic only
      according to the logic P2P routing and not to the real optimal IP
      layer network routing, and this causes mass P2P redundant traffic
      across many Automatic Systems(AS).

Internet-Draft               p2psip bcp                     March 2010


   3. The reliability and availability of subscriber data: Current P2P
      network can't provide an efficient solution for the reliability
      and availability of subscriber data in case of the random joining
      or exiting of the P2P nodes happened in the network.

   4. Duplicate data consistency: There are many replicas for subscriber
      data to acquire enough availability. It's very common that the
      subscriber data are often modified, so the system must allow for
      updates and amendments to be propagated to all replicas
      asynchronously.

   5. Hot spot: The subscriber data are distributed uneven in the
      network, which will cause that some nodes have much more
      subscriber data than others. Therefore, it will probably leads to
      the high traffic burdened by these nodes, which might makes these
      nodes overload and even fault in some cases.

   6. Single node failure: If a node fails, its clients will not gain
      the service.

   7. Others: TBD.

   It discusses some key technologies in section 3.3 with a view to
   solve the above questions.

3. DSN VoIP System Overview

   DSN VoIP system is a VoIP system based on P2P overlay. DSN VoIP
   system uses SIP protocol for call transaction and RELOAD for call
   routing.

3.1. System Architecture

   According to the Architecture of RELOAD, DSN VoIP system takes the
   similar architecture and contains some essential components in RELOAD,
   such as Usage Layer, Routing Layer, Storage and so on. The
   architecture of DSN VoIP system is shown as figure 1.

   There are two basic modules in P2PSIP layer: KBR and Data Storage
   module.

   The key based routing, KBR, refers to find the best suitable host for
   an input key, also includes ID management, DHT routing protocol,
   Topology Maintenance, peers failure detecting and etc. DSN VoIP
   system implements a unique KBR routing scheme with real-time response
   and a traffic localization mechanism, including a novel ID assignment
   method.

   The data storage module takes charge of management of subscriber data,
   including storage, restoring, consistency verification and etc. Here
   DSN VoIP system implements a unique and practical replica placement
   strategy and an effective consistency strategy.

3.2. System Implementation and Components

   DSN VoIP system includes distributed servers and subscriber terminals.
   These servers form the DSN VoIP network through P2P protocol and
   share load for each other. According to the different function, the
   server can be Peer Node(PN), Application Server(AS), Enrollment
   Server(ES), Edge Agent(EA), Super Peer-Maintenance (SPM),Relay
   Node(RN) and RN Cluster Server(RCS). According to the support for P2P
   protocol, the subscriber terminal can be the traditional SIP
   Client(SiC) and Peer Client(PeC). The DSN VoIP system framework is
   shown as figure 2.

          Figure 2 The framework and components of DSN VoIP system

   Peer Node(PN): PN is the core node in DSN VoIP network and is
   deployed by telecom operators. PN is responsible for DHT topology
   Maintenance, overlay routing, storage and access for
   subscriber/service data, subscriber registration and Authentication,
   BootStrap, SIP session control and VoIP service.

   Application Server(AS): AS can provide other services which can't be
   provided by Peer Node(PN).

   Enrollment Server(ES): ES provides BootStrap service when the PeC or
   PN joins the DSN VoIP network for the first time. When new PN joins,
   ES is responsible for Authentication for the new node. ES is deployed
   by telecom operators and fixed in the network.

   Edge Agent(EA):EA provides the relay service for SiC and adapt to all
   kinds of services and connections to PN. EA support SIP proxy
   discovery for DSN and connection with PN.

   SPM(Super Peer Maintenance): SPM is an administrator for one zone.
   SPM undertakes the registration of the PN nodes which are in the same
   zone, assigns the node ID to PN nodes and maintain DHT routing
   information.

Internet-Draft               p2psip bcp                     March 2010


   Relay Node(RN): RN is responsible for NAT traversal and media traffic
   forwarding. RN can discover the DSN and connection with PN. RN can be
   deployed by telecom operators or upgraded PeC.

   RN Cluster Server(RCS): RCS is responsible for the management of RN
   nodes according to topology information or RTT(Round-Trip Time). RCS
   manages one AS field and assigns a suitable RN for PeC according to
   the information about PeC's request or location etc.

   SIP Client(SiC): SiC support only SIP protocol and can't discover the
   DSN network if it is directly connected to the DSN. It must connect
   directly with Edge Agent (EA).

   Peer Client(PeC): PeC support both SIP protocol and P2P protocol. PeC
   can be upgraded to be Relay Node (RN) or RN Cluster, but can't be
   Peer Node(PN).

   PN nodes form the DSN VoIP network and interconnect via P2P protocol.
   The subscriber terminal can get valid service once it connects to any
   PN. If some but not all PN nodes fail or go offline, this will not
   affect the normal operation of DSN network. We can add more new PN
   nodes to augment the capacity of DSN network.

3.3. System Key technologies

   In this section, it presents with some key technologies which is
   aiming at solving the problem in sec 2.2.

   1. SPM assisted one hop route: DSN VoIP system is typically deployed
      as a two-layer DHT, including a global DHT (correspond to
      countrywide) and several regional DHTs (correspond to provinces).
      For each region, there are several special peers dedicated to
      routing information update and some other management tasks and
      these special peers are SPM. Multiple SPMs can be deployed for a
      large region. Each one is responsible for a partition of PN
      belonging to that region, and these SPMs backup each other. SPMs
      from different regions are full-mesh connected, they run a gossip-
      based protocol to maintain a strongly consistent view of their
      existence. All PN nodes must register to the local SPM of the same
      region, when they join the network. During runtime, once the PN's
      state change is detected by its neighboring PN, the neighbor will
      notify its local SPM, and then the SPM will disseminate the event
      to other SPMs, finally each SPM will broadcast this notification
      to all PN nodes under the charge of it. Each PN thus can obtain
      other PN's information through SPM and can maintains routing table
      for all PNs and we enlarge the routing table's size on each PN. So
      SPM assisted one hop route can be implemented.

   2. Traffic Localization: Recent studies have shown that a large
      volume of inter-domain redundant traffic by P2P mismatch problem
      already became the serious problem. As mentioned above, each PN
      node joins the countrywide global DHT and one regional DHT at the
      same time. We use a novel peer ID assignment scheme optimized for
      global load balancing, which can write the regional information
      into peer ID. With this unique ID scheme, the global DHT and
      regional DHT can be maintained by only one KBR(Key Based Routing)
      incarnation, that's different with many other layered DHT proposed.
      Every object will be put in the regional DHT and global DHT for
      disaster recovery, according to the normal DHT semantics
      internally.

   3. Replica Placement strategy: The DSN VoIP system raises a unique
      N:N replica placement which provides a effective way to backup and
      recovery subscriber data from local and remote region. Under this
      solution a parallel recovery factor N is defined as how many
      candidates should be used as the recovery. And B is defined as the
      number of Backups which means how many duplicated replicas should
      the overlay hold. subscriber data in each primary peer node is
      divided into S=N/B slices After that, each B backup peers in a
      group for this primary peer will backup the same slice of
      subscriber data. One peer node could execute data backup procedure
      to send data to different backup peers simultaneously. Compare to
      1:1 backup mechanism, not only does our N:N replica placement
      increase the efficiency of parallel recovery, but also avoids the
      reservation of half capacities (CPU cycles, bandwidth) for
      potential migration of the service backed up.

   4. Consistency Strategy: In order to ensure better data consistency,
      DSN VoIP system will trigger "DataCheck" and "DataGoHome"
      mechanisms periodically. DSN VoIP system through "DataCheck"
      triggers the comparison between the data version information of
      the corresponding PN nodes, and updates the inconsistent data to
      ensure that the eventual consistency of subscriber profiles.
      "DataGoHome" takes charge of identify those temporary
      irregularities data, recalculate their key-value pair and push
      them to correct PN nodes. With the help of timing service always
      available in telecom offices, DSN VoIP system uses timestamp in
      order to capture causality between different versions of the same
      data. One can determine whether two versions of a data have a
      causal ordering by examine their timestamps.

   5. Strip Segmentation method Based ID Assignment: We use this method
      to generate the subscriber ID. This method can evenly distribute
      the subscriber data on each PN node so as to achieve traffic load
      balance and avoid hot spot. The detailed method can be referred to
      [4].

   6. Single node failure handle: If a PN node faults, we design some
      mechanisms to ensure the natural operation of VoIP service. For
      the session in progress, the session between the caller and the
      callee is established, the standby PN checks the primary PN in
      failure, and the standby PN notifies the associated nodes and
      switch the session to itself. For the new call originated from the
      caller, if the standby PN has switch to be the primary PN and
      notified the subscribers, the call originated from the subscriber
      will be routed to the standby PN. For the new call originated from
      the callee, if the callee knows the failure in the primary PN by
      requesting routing or querying routing table, the callee will
      route the query to the standby PN and establishes the session.

   7. Others: TBD.

4. Validation of DSN VoIP system

4.1. Overview

   We do some measurement and simulation experiments to validate the DSN
   VoIP system and its key technologies.

   The SIP protocol is implemented in the application layer and we
   validate the call disposal capability in this layer.

   The P2PSIP protocol is implemented in the P2PSIP layer and we do some
   simulation experiments to validate some key technologies in this
   layer.

4.2. Validation of application layer

   We set up a DSN VoIP demo system in CMCC lab and do some measurement
   for the practical system. Demo system is made up of twenty PC servers
   and two management PC servers. Twenty PC servers are PN nodes for
   overlay network. All these PN nodes have the same hardware and
   software configuration: Pentium(R) Dual-Core CPU E5200, 2.50GHz,4G
   memory and 300G hard disk; OS is SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10 SP2
   (i586). All PC servers connect through three D-LINK layer2 switch.

   For measuring the bulk call performance of the demo system, we
   configure the following parameters:

Internet-Draft               p2psip bcp                     March 2010


   1.call parameters:

          each call last time=30 second

          each measurement last time = 40 minutes

   2. subscriber data parameters:

          subscriber number for each PN: 20 thousand

          caller subscriber number = callee subscriber number = 6000

   The format of SIP subscriber terminal ID is like 6xxxxxxx@bj.dsn.com.
   The callers and callees must be registered before bulk call
   performance measurement. All these registered subscribers and calls
   handled by each PN are randomly averagely distributed in system. Our
   algorithm can ensure the well-proportioned distribution for
   registered subscribers and calls handled by each PN.

   We measured the maximal call transaction performance when the demo
   system respectively included 4,8,12,16,20 PN nodes. We collected the
   following parameters:

   1.Registration statistics: average register time

   2.Call Establishment time: average call setup time, average call tear
   down time, Post dial delay

   3.Call finish: call success ratio, call attempts per second(CAPS)

   If the call lose ratio is below 0.5% and don't persist to increase,
   we think the call performance is under the limit of the system.

   The following are the results.

   1.average register time

   Node number                 4        8        12        16        20

   average register time(ms): 34       25        26        32        32

   2. average call setup time

   Node number                 4        8        12        16        20

   average setup time(ms):    272      247       251       884       236

   3. average call tear down time

   Node number                 4        8        12        16        20

   average tear down time(ms): 161     142       152       406       171

   4. Post dial delay

   Node number                 4        8        12        16        20

   Post dial delay (ms):      260      235       239      1004      229

   5. call success ratio

   Node number               4        8        12        16        20

   call success ratio(%):   100      100      99.99     99.94     99.89

   6. call attempts per second(CAPS)

   Node number          4        8        12        16        20

   CAPS:               48        84       129       172       216

   Total call number: 230400    403200   619196    824880    925546

   Through above measurement, the conclusion is:

   1. The DSN VoIP system has the capability for call transaction.

   2. The system capability can approximately linearly increase as the
      number of PN nodes increase.

   We have measure the bulk call performance for the demo system.
   However due to measurement time limited, these results are just
   elementary and further measurement will be done.

4.3. Validation of P2PSIP layer

   We establish an simulation environment with 3000 PN nodes located in
   three regions separately and There is one SPM node in each region.

4.3.1. Reliability

   This measure will validate the replica placement and consistency
   strategy. We evaluate the reliability of DSN VoIP system in the face
   of a variety of failure and application models.

                Table 1 the reliability of DSN VoIP system

   +-----------------------------------------------------------+
   |  Application Model       Failure Model       Success Rate |
   | write:1/s per node        Failure1 (1%)         100%      |
   | read:10/s per node        Failure1 (3%)         100%      |
   |                           Failure2              99.9992%  |
   |                           Failure3              99.951%   |

   | read:100/s per node       Failure1 (3%)         99.9973%  |
   |                           Failure2              99.9934%  |
   |                           Failure3              99.30%    |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------+
   As shown in Table 1, under normal application model, each PN received
   1 write and 10 read requests per second. 1% Failure1 model will
   result in 1% of peers fail in every hour, and in the next hour 80% of
   fail peers will come back. As is clear from Table 1, the 1% and 3%
   Failure1 model almost no impact on business success rate. The success
   rate in 12 hours is almost 100%. The Failure2 and Failure3 model lead
   to more number of peers' failure, but the system still able to
   maintain more than 99.9% success rate. With the increased of business
   requests, the success rate has declined, but still more than 99%.

4.3.2. Uniformity Distribution

   We propose Strip Segmentation method Based ID Assignment for the
   uniformity distribution of subscriber data and PN node ID. We
   randomly generated 10 million subscriber data, and put them into the
   3000 peers based on DHT key-value rule. Finally, we made a statistic
   for distribution of these data in 3000 peers and we can see that the
   subscriber data obeys a Gaussian-like distribution through the
   optimization of strip segmentation arithmetic and ID assignment
   mechanism. The number of data in 98% of PN nodes maintained at around
   10000. The model of data stored in DSN VoIP system has perfect load-
   sharing so that it also improves the traffic balance finally.

   We also validate this from the application layer measurement. We
   randomly choose 12 thousand ordinal subscribers and don't know how
   these subscribers distribute. Through measurement, we can see that
   the number of registered subscribers on each PN is approximately
   equal. So the call traffic undertaken by each PN is also

Internet-Draft               p2psip bcp                     March 2010


   approximately equal. Here we give the below results to verify it( for
   the limited space, here only give the random 8 PN nodes call number).

              Table 2 the call distribution of DSN VoIP system

   +-------------------------------------------------------------+
   |  Node Number        |  4    |  8    |  12   |  16   |  20   |
   +-------------------------------------------------------------+
   |  Call Distribution  | 56695 | 51655 | 53796 | 53198 | 48822 |
   |                     | 57835 | 51446 | 52377 | 51234 | 47857 |
   |                     | 57778 | 50292 | 52475 | 53987 | 50644 |
   |                     | 58092 | 51124 | 50540 | 52334 | 51238 |
   |                     |       | 50575 | 50589 | 52290 | 46895 |
   |                     |       | 51848 | 50885 | 50343 | 45838 |
   |                     |       | 50300 | 48851 | 50022 | 48575 |
   |                     |       | 48125 | 53523 | 54014 | 46805 |
   +-------------------------------------------------------------+
   So the Strip Segmentation method is useful to implement load balance
   among the DSN VoIP network.

4.3.3. SPM Bandwidth Consumption

   Although SPM node is only responsible for the maintenance and
   synchronization of One-hop Routing Table in DSN VoIP system, its
   bandwidth consumption is still one of concerned issues. We recorded
   the bandwidth consumption of SPM under various failure models.

                 Table 3 the bandwidth consumption of SPM

   +-------------------------------------------------------+
   |  Failure Model        |  Bandwidth Consumption (KB/S) |
   +-------------------------------------------------------+
   |  Failure1 (1%)        |         1.9                   |
   |  Failure1 (5%)        |         34.8                  |
   |  Failure1 (10%)       |         75.6                  |
   |  Failure2 (50fails)   |         93                    |
   |  Failure2 (100fails)  |         210                   |
   |  Failure2 (200fails)  |         450                   |
   |  Failure2 (500fails)  |         820                   |
   |  Failure3             |         15.3                  |
   +-------------------------------------------------------+
   As can be seen in table 3, in the general failure model such as
   Failure1 model, the bandwidth consumption of SPM is very tiny, almost
   can be ignored. Even in the case of Failure2 model (almost 50% of
   peers in same region failed simultaneously); the bandwidth
   consumption is just 820KB/s. For such a very low probability of
   unexpected events, this overhead of SPM is totally acceptable. It is

Internet-Draft               p2psip bcp                     March 2010


   worth mentioning that SPM uses a unified manner to inform the routing
   table change in Failure3 model, so the bandwidth consumption
   maintained at a very small value.
