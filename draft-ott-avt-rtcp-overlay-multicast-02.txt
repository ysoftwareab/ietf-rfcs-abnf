Internet-Draft          RTCP in Overlay Multicast           October 2009


1.  Introduction

   RTP [RFC3550] provides transport mechanisms suitable for unicast,
   any-source multicast and single-source multicast.  RTP is primarily
   used to carry audio and video streams together with the RTP control
   protocol to provide periodic feedback about the media streams
   received in a specific time interval.  The RTCP reporting interval is
   defined as part of the RTCP and depends on the number of
   participants, type of participants (sender or receiver) and the
   operating environment of the session (point to point or multicast).

   The RFC3550 [RFC3550] specifies the maximum RTCP bandwidth to be 5%
   of the media bit rate.  In point to point sessions, each participant
   gets an equal share of 2.5% of the media bit rate to be used for
   RTCP.  In multicast (including any-source multicast and source-
   specific multicast) sessions, the senders usually share 25% of the
   allocated RTCP bandwidth and the receivers share the remaining 75% of
   the RTCP bandwidth.  The RTCP bandwidth share may be modified using
   RFC 3556 [RFC3556], but will generally be kept small so as to have a
   smooth media stream flow.

   In a multicast session, the RTCP reports are multicast so that each
   participant can receive the RTCP reports from every other participant
   and thus obtain a "global" view of the multicast session.  This,
   however, requires multicast connectivity between all peers and thus
   cannot be applied to Source-specific Multicast (SSM) [RFC3569].
   Specific RTCP extensions were developed for SSM
   [I-D.ietf-avt-rtcpssm] introducing a mechanism of RTCP reporting
   where the RTCP reports are unicast to a feedback target.  This
   mechanism is specifically applicable in scenarios where many-to-many
   group communication is not available or not desired or a sender-
   controlled summarized reporting is preferred.  RTCP reports are
   unicast to a feedback target specified during initialization or
   inside RTCP reports.  The RTCP reporting interval calculation
   specified in RTCP Extension for SSM uses the same mechanisms as
   specified in RFC3550 [RFC3550]; the distribution source may send RTCP
   RSI reports to control the rate at which RTCP reports are generated
   by the receivers.  The aforementioned rules for bandwidth
   modifications apply as well.

   Recent interest in overlay multicasting and ALM---to substitute for
   the lack of globally available native IP any-source multicast---
   motivates also carrying RTP-based media streams in such environments.

   In ALM, the participating nodes form a distribution tree to forward
   the data.  ALM involves the use of different mechanisms to construct
   and maintain the distribution tree.  In overlay multicast, individual
   multicast enabled networks are connected by virtual unicast links.

Internet-Draft          RTCP in Overlay Multicast           October 2009


   Overlay multicast involves mechanisms to construct optimal
   interconnection of virtual links.  An ALM can be viewed as a sub
   class of overlay multicast, if the individual multicast enabled
   networks have only one participating node.  So, further in this
   document, when we refer to overlay multicast it also includes ALM.
   Depending on the abstraction chosen for the overlay multicast, the
   RTP/RTCP entities using it may or may not be aware of the hop-by-hop
   forwarding of the packets:

   If they are not, regular any-source multicast operation of RTP and
   RTCP as per RFC 3550 is a workable, yet possibly not optimal
   solution.

   If RTP entities are aware of the forwarding process, additional RTCP
   reporting and aggregation mechanisms may be applied and the existing
   RTCP reporting mechanisms need to be investigated for their
   applicability in overlay multicast

   In either case, in an overlay multicast environment, using RTP to
   transport media streams will be straightforward,

   In this document, we take a very first stab at reviewing the RTCP
   reporting mechanism specified in RFC3550 [RFC3550] and the RTCP
   Extension for SSM to find its applicability in the overlay multicast
   environment.  We also discuss on the specific characteristics of the
   overlay multicast and the type of reporting that is desired on such
   environments.  This document also complements the RTP topologies
   overview [RFC5117].


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119] and indicate requirement levels for compliant
   implementations.

   The terminology defined in RTP [RFC3550], the RTP Profile for Audio
   and Video Conferences with Minimal Control [RFC3551], and the RTCP
   Extension for SSM [I-D.ietf-avt-rtcpssm], apply.

   For the time being, in this document, by overlay multicast we refer
   to a multicast overlay offering media distribution from a single
   source, analogous to SSM.

3.  Overlay Multicast

   In overlay multicast, the media streams are multicast over an network
   of virtual links that is constructed using mechanisms in line with
   the requirements of the application using the overlay.  The
   construction and maintenance of the overlay involves mechanisms for
   bootstrapping and connecting new participants to the overlay,
   routing, pro-active/reactive repair, improving scalability and
   recovery from loss of a forwarding node or a virtual link.  In this
   document, these mechanisms are further referred to as overlay
   operation.  As the overlay network is formed by the participating
   nodes, the loss of a participating node brings change in the network
   structure.  So, there is an inherent instability in the overlay
   multicast which are addressed by the overlay operation.

   In overlay multicast, the participating nodes can use mechanisms for
   providing error resilience and congestion control that can pro-
   actively adapt or reactively repair the media streams depending on
   the receiver metrics reported by the nodes below its hierarchy.  In
   this document, the error resilience mechanisms together with
   congestion control techniques are further referred to as media
   operation.

   The media operation depends on the metrics (reported reception
   quality) reported by the participants.  The overlay operation can
   depend on different types of metrics and may also include the media
   quality metrics like round trip time, observed packet loss, jitter
   etc.  As the overlay operation depends on the application using the
   overlay, there can be significant overlap with the metrics used by
   media operation.

   Using RTP in overlay multicast does not require any change to its
   specification.  Every participating node that receives the RTP packet
   replicates the packet and sends down the distribution tree.  RTCP SR
   follows the same path as RTP, so it does not bring in changes with
   its use in overlay multicast.  In the case of RTCP RR, it reports the
   receiver's perceived media quality and it carries significant data
   based on which the algorithms of media and/or overlay operation can
   operate.

   The multicast overlay maintenance mechanisms may operate entirely
   independent of RTCP reporting, they may choose to leverage parts of
   the RTCP reporting, or they may rely entirely on RTCP.  In this
   document, we are concerned about the operation of RTCP reporting in
   such an environment and we do not take (at this point) any position
   on the way the overlay operates.

4.  Classifying feedback reporting mechanism

   Any feedback reporting mechanism in a session with n participants can
   be classified into one of the following categories.
   o  (i) 1 to 1 reporting
   o  (ii) 1 to n reporting
   o  (iii) 1 to m reporting (m < n, every node reports to m nodes)
   An example of '1 to 1' reporting is RTCP in SSM with unicast feedback
   target (and, of course, in case of point-to-point sessions).  An
   example of '1 to n' reporting is RTCP in multicast mode as specified
   in RFC 3550.  In further sections, we shall be referring to these
   mechanisms while discussing the applicability of a RTCP reporting
   model.


5.  Classifying overlay multicast topologies and  media/overlay
    operations

   The effectiveness of a chosen RTCP reporting model, directly depends
   on the type of overlay multicast topology, type of the media/overlay
   operation and the number of participants in the session.  So, when
   considering the applicability of a RTCP reporting model, they need to
   be evaluated against the every possible combinations of overlay
   multicast topology, media and overlay operation.  The overlay
   multicast topologies can be broadly classified into two categories.
   o  (i) Overlay multicast, with no or very minimal overlay
      operations(virtual links are statically configured)
   o  (ii) Overlay multicast, that relies on overlay operations to
      dynamically configure distribution tree.
   The overlay and media operations can be classified into two
   categories.
   o  (i) Centralized: A single entity decides on the type of media/
      overlay operations.
   o  (ii) Distributed: At any instant more than one entity is
      attempting to perform media/overlay operation.


6.  RTP Entities in an overlay multicast network

   The below figure represents a sample overlay multicast network.  In
   this section, we see how the RTP entities can be used to describe a
   overlay multicast network.

               Figure 1: A sample overlay multicast topology

   Each OMN can be considered as an entity with an RTP translator, an
   optional instance of RTCP feedback target, and an optional media
   repair agent (media handler).  The purpose of the translator is to
   replicate and forward the streams to different network destinations.
   The feedback target handles incoming RTCP reports, possibly
   aggregating, and forwarding them.  The media repair agent receives
   RTP streams (possibly storing them temporarily), processes received
   RTCP reports and may perform media repair, and generates RTCP
   receiver reports.  In the above figure, the translator in OMN1
   receives the stream from media source and forwards it to three
   different network clouds.

   Role of RTP Translator in forwarding RTP streams: The RTP translator
   in each OMN forwards the received RTP packets (from its parent node)
   to all virtual links it is connected with.  For example, RTP
   translator in OMN1 forwards RTP packets to its RTP media handler,
   OMN3, OMN4 and the IP multicast network it is connected with.

   Role of RTP Translator in handling RTCP reports: When there is no
   change to the media encoding, the RTP translator uses the straight
   case of Replicate and Forward mechanism.

   Replicate and Forward: The RTP translator replicates and forwards the
   RTCP RR received from one virtual link to all other virtual links.
   Below, we explain using OMN1 as example.  The RTP translator in OMN1
   receives RTCP RR from,
   o  the media handler (which is within the same node)
   o  the native multicast network





Devadoss, et al.         Expires April 29, 2010                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          RTCP in Overlay Multicast           October 2009


   o  OMN3
   o  OMN4
   o  parent OMN (which is forwarding the RTCP RRs received from the
      other virtual links, it is connected with)

   To explain the RTCP forwarding rules, we take an sample event where
   the translator in OMN1 receives a RTCP RR from IP multicast network.
   The event response shall be that, it is forwarded to the media
   handler (within OMN1), OMN3, OMN4 and to the parent node (in the case
   of OMN1, it is media source).  In this way, all participating nodes
   in the session shall receive RTCP RR from all other participating
   nodes.

   In the overlay multicast scenario, the RTP translator in an OMN can
   be extended to do other operations like filtering and aggregating
   RTCP reports.  But to realize it, the scope and definitions of RTP
   translator need to be analyzed to see if it has support for it.


7.  Applicability of RTCP reporting as defined in RFC 3550

   If this reporting mechanism is to be used in an overlay multicast,
   then the RTP translator in each node replicates and forwards the RTCP
   reports on all (virtual) links except the incoming (virtual) link.
   It is a form of '1 to n' reporting, where all participants get a copy
   of the RTCP report sent by every other participant.  Now, let us look
   at the effectiveness of this reporting model in the overlay multicast
   environment.

   With the increase in number of receivers, the RTCP reporting interval
   increases.  The larger the reporting interval, fewer the options
   available for media operation.  For example, with 'x' number of
   participants, it can be possible to do retransmission based on an
   RTCP report indicating a lost packet.  But with the increasing number
   of participants (say n*x), the interval gets bigger by n times
   leading to fewer options of error repair mechanisms.  In IP
   multicast, the error resilience mechanisms like adaptive FEC,
   retransmission can be performed only by the source or one designated
   participant/observer.  But in the case of overlay multicast, there
   are more options available to deploy these mechanisms at intermediary
   nodes which become an inherent part of the forwarding tree.
   Furthermore, the importance of overlay operation increases with
   increasing number of participants: the larger the number of nodes,
   the greater the importance of overlay operation in maintaining
   stability i.e., the importance of the reports that influence the
   quality of the overlay operation grows.

   The proportional relationship of number of nodes with the RTCP



Devadoss, et al.         Expires April 29, 2010                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft          RTCP in Overlay Multicast           October 2009


   reporting interval was designed to limit the bandwidth consumed by
   the RTCP and provide scalability so as to evolve as a multicast
   session with many number of participants.  But in the overlay
   multicast scenario, with the reducing number of reports per time unit
   the quality of the overlay is reduced due to reduced effectiveness of
   media and overlay operation.

   In contrast to any-source multicast, however, the RTCP reports sent
   by a particular node are not automatically received by all other
   nodes.  Instead, the RTCP reports travel along the virtual links
   formed between participating nodes.  This may be used to limit their
   spread and may allow for mechanisms improving overall efficiency of
   RTCP reporting.  Thus, while the total number of participants in an
   RTP session limits the RTCP bandwidth consumption within 5% of the
   media session, this limit may not need to be applied the total
   consumption across the entire overlay multicast, but be maintained in
   local regions only.


8.  Applicability of RTCP with unicast feedback target

   If RTCP/SSM reporting mechanism is to be used in an overlay
   multicast, then the RTCP RR reports are unicast to a designated node
   that is either within or outside the overlay multicast.  It is a form
   of '1 to 1' reporting and here we discuss on its applicability in the
   overlay multicast.

   RTCP/SSM defines the use of a single distribution source in
   conjunction with one or more feedback targets.  If multiple feedback
   targets are to be used, their respective setup and coordination is
   outside the scope of the RTCP/SSM specification.  Conceptually,
   however, the RTCP/SSM mechanisms support the idea of hierarchical
   report aggregation and forwarding, even though the RTP media as well
   as the RTCP sender reporting distribution paths are supposed to use
   SSM multicasting at the IP layer.  This notion of RTCP aggregation
   would need to become more explicit, but could provide a first basis
   for realizing overlay multicast.

   Overlay multicast also provides explicit support for using
   intermediary (participating nodes in the distribution tree) media
   error resilience mechanisms.  Stepwise RTCP aggregation would also
   make the necessary feedback information available to the individual
   intermediate nodes and could thus provide the hook for invoking
   repair mechanisms.

   The (kind of) centralized reporting and centralized decision making
   in RTCP/SSM would need to be expanded to allow for more flexible
   media and/or overlay operation and, in particular, would need to



Devadoss, et al.         Expires April 29, 2010                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft          RTCP in Overlay Multicast           October 2009


   cover the assignment and maintenance of feedback targets as regular
   part of the overlay operation.

   An interesting issue is whether this source-specific type of
   operation could be expanded later towards multi-source operation in
   order to support any-source multicast overlays as well.  While RTCP/
   SSM seems to be a promising starting point, this latter step is left
   for further study.


9.  Desirable features of RTCP in overlay multicast

   The following list is an initial set of desirable functions for
   media/overlay operation:
   o  Need for a mechanism of RTCP reporting, where the reporting
      interval is decoupled from the number of participants in the media
      session.  But still the original reason behind this linkage
      (limiting the RTCP bandwidth consumption) can be maintained
      through other suitable mechanisms.  In essence, fine-granular RTCP
      reporting could be confined to subgroups while the global
      bandwidth limitation is still maintained.
   o  Overlay multicast brings in the option to use media operation at
      intermediate nodes.  With more frequent reporting, their
      effectiveness increases.  So, to increase the reporting frequency
      and at the same time limit the bandwidth consumption, a RTCP RR
      reporting mechanism that provides the feature of '1 to m'(n > m, n
      - number of participants in the session) reporting is needed.  By
      choosing a small m, the RTCP RR reporting frequency can be
      increased as it is directed only to a small subset of
      participating nodes.  Such subset reporting could be carried out
      at a single hierarchy level inside an overlay multicast or across
      multiple such levels.
   o  Media operation should be able to leverage the additionally
      available reporting information to optimize performance (for error
      control, possibly congestion control, etc.)
   o  Overlay operation can be either centralized or distributed.  For
      example, the decisions related to overlay operations can be made
      only by a single node for the whole network or can be distributed
      to many groups, with each groups making the decisions depending on
      the collected metrics.  In the later form of overlay operation,
      the availability of '1 to m' reporting provides timely and more
      precise information for the algorithms used in the overlay
      operation.  As each group can act independent from the other
      groups, there may not be a need for reporting across the groups
      but there may be a need for a higher reporting frequency within
      the group.

10.  An example explaining the issues

   We take the below example for explaining the desired form of RTCP
   reporting in overlay multicast.

                          o(0) -Media source
                        /   \
                       /     \
                      /       \
                     o(1)      o(2)
                    /|\       /|\
                   / | \     / | \
                  o  o  o   o  o  o
                 (3)(4)(5) (6)(7)(8)

               Figure 2: A sample overlay multicast topology

   In the above figure, the nodes {1, 3, 4 and 5} and {2, 6, 7 and 8}
   are considered as a group with node 1 and 2 acting as their
   respective group leaders.  The overlay operation involves changing
   the group leader based on the metrics reported by the participating
   nodes.  In this form overlay network, the media operation can also be
   performed by nodes other than source(for example nodes 1 and 2).

   In the above example, the nodes {1, 3, 4 and 5} are more interested
   in RTCP reports from the nodes within their group rather than in the
   RTCP reports from {6 or 7 or 8}.  So, if RTCP reporting interval is
   to be proportional to the number of participants in the session, then
   the individual groups see reduced reporting due to the increase in
   the number of participants.  This reduces the effectiveness of both
   media and overlay operation.

   The paper "Construction of an Efficient Overlay Multicast
   Infrastructure for Real-time Applications" is an overlay multicast
   solution, that dynamically re-arranges the distribution tree based on
   the metrics reported(or measured with) 'm' other nodes.

11.  Some Questions

   o  How are the individual regions (if any) for fine-grained reporting
      to be modeled?  Should they form separate RTP sessions or be just
      a part of the (single) regular session?
   o  Do the existing RTP entities suffice or need new ones be
      introduced?  For example, should an RTP Forwarder be defined as an
      entity performing functions of intermediate nodes?

   o  Should RTCP flow only along the established multicast distribution
      tree (it may have to for NAT traversal reasons) or should more
      complex forms of reporting be supported?
   o  How will distribution along multiple trees be addressed?
   o  Should the overlay operation be considered at all?  As a minimum,
      the overlay operation could tap into information provided by RTCP
      anyway; as an intermediate step, RTCP could be expanded modestly
      to support certain types of overlay operation; at the other end of
      the spectrum, the overlay operation could rely on RTCP alone.
