          1.  Status of this Memo

          This memo describes a straight-forward approach towards
          defining traps used with the SNMP.  It is specifically
          intended for use by the authors of experimental MIBs, and
          emphasizes a concise descriptive approach.  Use of this
          approach is fully consistent with the Internet-standard
          network management framework.

          Distribution of this memo is unlimited.  Please send comments
          to: Marshall T. Rose <mrose@psi.com>.

          2.  Historical Perspective

          As reported in RFC 1052, IAB Recommendations for the
          Development of Internet Network Management Standards [1], a
          two-prong strategy for network management of TCP/IP-based
          internets was undertaken.  In the short-term, the Simple
          Network Management Protocol (SNMP), defined in RFC 1067, was
          to be used to manage nodes in the Internet community.  In the
          long-term, the use of the OSI network management framework was
          to be examined.  Two documents were produced to define the
          management information: RFC 1065, which defined the Structure
          of Management Information (SMI), and RFC 1066, which defined
          the Management Information Base (MIB).  Both of these
          documents were designed so as to be compatible with both the
          SNMP and the OSI network management framework.

          This strategy was quite successful in the short-term:
          Internet-based network management technology was fielded, by
          both the research and commercial communities, within a few
          months.  As a result of this, portions of the Internet
          community became network manageable in a timely fashion.

          As reported in RFC 1109, Report of the Second Ad Hoc Network
          Management Review Group [2], the requirements of the SNMP and
          the OSI network management frameworks were more different than
          anticipated.  As such, the requirement for compatibility
          between the SMI/MIB and both frameworks was suspended.  This
          action permitted the operational network management framework,
          based on the SNMP, to respond to new operational needs in the
          Internet community by producing MIB-II.

          In May of 1990, the core documents were elevated to "Standard
          Protocols" with "Recommended" status.  As such, the Internet-
          standard network management framework consists of: Structure
          and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based
          internets, RFC 1155 [3], which describes how managed objects
          contained in the MIB are defined; Management Information Base
          for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets, which
          describes the managed objects contained in the MIB, RFC 1156
          [4]; and, the Simple Network Management Protocol, RFC 1157
          [5], which defines the protocol used to manage these objects.

          3.  Defining Traps

          Due to its initial requirement to be protocol-independent, the
          Internet-standard SMI does not provide a means for defining
          traps.  Instead, the SNMP defines a few standardized traps and
          provides a means for management enterprises to transmit
          enterprise-specific traps.

          However, with the introduction of experimental MIBs, some of
          which have a need to define experiment-specific traps, a
          convenient means of defining traps is desirable.  The TRAP-
          TYPE macro is suggested for this purpose:

               TRAP-TYPE MACRO ::=
               BEGIN
                   TYPE NOTATION ::= "ENTERPRISE" enterprise
                                         (VALUE OBJECT IDENTIFIER)
                                     VarPart
                                     DescrPart
                                     ReferPart
                   VALUE NOTATION ::= value (VALUE INTEGER)

                   VarPart ::=
                              "VARIABLES" "{" VarTypes "}"
                                   | empty
                   VarTypes ::=
                              VarType | VarTypes "," VarType
                   VarType ::=
                              vartype (VALUE ObjectName)

                   DescrPart ::=
                              "DESCRIPTION" description (VALUE DisplayString)
                                   | empty

                   ReferPart ::=
                              "REFERENCE" reference (VALUE DisplayString)
                                   | empty

               END

          3.1.  Mapping of the TRAP-TYPE macro

          It should be noted that the expansion of the TRAP-TYPE macro
          is something which conceptually happens during implementation
          and not during run-time.


          3.1.1.  Mapping of the ENTERPRISE clause

          The ENTERPRISE clause, which must be present, defines the
          management enterprise under whose registration authority this
          trap is defined (for a discussion on delegation of
          registration authority, see the SMI [3]).  This value is
          placed inside the enterprise field of the SNMP Trap-PDU.

          By convention, if the value of the ENTERPRISE clause is "snmp"
          as defined in MIB-II, then instead of using this value, the
          value of sysObjectID is placed in the enterprise field of the
          SNMP Trap-PDU.  This provides a simple means of using the
          TRAP-TYPE macro to represent the existing standard SNMP traps;
          it is not intended to provide a means to define additional
          standard SNMP traps.


          3.1.2.  Mapping of the VARIABLES clause

          The VARIABLES clause, which need not be present, defines the
          ordered sequence of MIB objects which are contained within
          every instance of the trap type.  Each variable is placed, in
          order, inside the variable-bindings field of the SNMP Trap-
          PDU.  Note that at the option of the agent, additional
          variables may follow in the variable-bindings field.


          3.1.3.  Mapping of the DESCRIPTION clause

          The DESCRIPTION clause, which need not be present, contains a
          textual definition of the trap type.  Note that in order to
          conform to the ASN.1 syntax, the entire value of this clause
          must be enclosed in double quotation marks, although the value
          may be multi-line.

          Further, note that if the MIB module does not contain a
          textual description of the object type elsewhere then the
          DESCRIPTION clause must be present.

          3.1.4.  Mapping of the REFERENCE clause

          The REFERENCE clause, which need not be present, contains a
          textual cross-reference to a trap, event, or alarm, defined in
          some other MIB module.  This is useful when de-osifying a MIB
          produced by some other organization.


          3.1.5.  Mapping of the TRAP-TYPE value

          The value of an invocation of the TRAP-TYPE macro is the
          (integer) number which is uniquely assigned to the trap by the
          registration authority indicated by the ENTERPRISE clause.
          This value is placed inside the specific-trap field of the
          SNMP Trap-PDU, and the generic-trap field is set to
          "enterpriseSpecific(6)".

          By convention, if the value of the ENTERPRISE clause is "snmp"
          as defined in MIB-II, then the value of an invocation of the
          TRAP-TYPE macro is placed inside the generic-trap field of the
          SNMP Trap-PDU, and the specific-trap field is set to 0.  This
          provides a simple means of using the TRAP-TYPE macro to
          represent the existing standard SNMP traps; it is not intended
          to provide a means to define additional standard SNMP traps.

          3.2.  Usage Example

          Consider a simple example of an enterprise-specific trap that
          is sent when a communication link failure is encountered:

          myEnterprise OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { enterprises 9999 }

          myLinkDown TRAP-TYPE
              ENTERPRISE  myEnterprise
              VARIABLES   { ifIndex }
              DESCRIPTION
                          "A myLinkDown trap signifies that the sending
                          SNMP application entity recognizes a failure
                          in one of the communications links represented
                          in the agent's configuration."
              ::= 2
