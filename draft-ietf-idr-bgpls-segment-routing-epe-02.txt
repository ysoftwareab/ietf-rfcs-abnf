       Segment Routing Egress Peer Engineering BGP-LS Extensions
              draft-ietf-idr-bgpls-segment-routing-epe-02

Abstract

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages source routing.  A node steers a
   packet through a controlled set of instructions, called segments, by
   prepending the packet with an SR header.  A segment can represent any
   instruction, topological or service-based.  SR allows to enforce a
   flow through any topological path and service chain while maintaining
   per-flow state only at the ingress node of the SR domain.

   The Segment Routing architecture can be directly applied to the MPLS
   dataplane with no change on the forwarding plane.  It requires minor
   extension to the existing link-state routing protocols.

   This document outline a BGP-LS extension for exporting BGP egress
   point topology information (including its peers, interfaces and
   peering ASs) in a way that is exploitable in order to compute
   efficient Egress Point Engineering policies and strategies.

1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages source routing.  A node steers a
   packet through a controlled set of instructions, called segments, by
   prepending the packet with an SR header.  A segment can represent any
   instruction, topological or service-based.  SR allows to enforce a
   flow through any topological path and service chain while maintaining
   per-flow state only at the ingress node of the SR domain.

   The Segment Routing architecture can be directly applied to the MPLS
   dataplane with no change on the forwarding plane.  It requires minor
   extension to the existing link-state routing protocols.

   This document outline a BGP-LS extension for exporting BGP egress
   point topology information (including its peers, interfaces and
   peering ASs) in a way that is exploitable in order to compute
   efficient Egress Point Engineering policies and strategies.

   This document defines new types of segments: a Peer Node segment
   describing the BGP session between two nodes; a Peer Adjacency
   Segment describing the link (one or more) that is used by the BGP
   session; the Peer Set Segment describing an arbitrary set of sessions
   or links between the local BGP node and its peers.

   While an egress point topology usually refers to eBGP sessions
   between external peers, there's nothing in the extensions defined in
   this document that would prevent the use of these extensions in the
   context of iBGP sessions.

2.  Segment Routing Documents

   The main reference for this document is the SR architecture defined
   in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing].

   The Segment Routing Egress Peer Engineering architecture is described
   in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-central-epe].

3.  BGP Peering Segments

   As defined in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-central-epe], an EPE
   enabled Egress PE node MAY advertise segments corresponding to its
   attached peers.  These segments are called BGP peering segments or
   BGP Peering SIDs.  They enable the expression of source-routed inter-
   domain paths.

   An ingress border router of an AS may compose a list of segments to
   steer a flow along a selected path within the AS, towards a selected
   egress border router C of the AS and through a specific peer.  At
   minimum, a BGP Peering Engineering policy applied at an ingress PE
   involves two segments: the Node SID of the chosen egress PE and then
   the BGP Peering Segment for the chosen egress PE peer or peering
   interface.

   This document defines the BGP EPE Peering Segments:

   o  Peer Node Segment (Peer-Node-SID)

   o  Peer Adjacency Segment (Peer-Adj-SID)

   o  Peer Set Segment (Peer-Set-SID)

   Each BGP session MUST be described by a Peer Node Segment.  The
   description of the BGP session MAY be augmented by additional
   Adjacency Segments.  Finally, each Peer Node Segment and Peer
   Adjacency Segment MAY be part of the same group/set so to be able to
   group EPE resources under a common Peer-Set Segment Identifier (SID).

   Therefore, when the extensions defined in this document are applied
   to the use case defined in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-central-epe]:

   o  One Peer Node Segment MUST be present.

   o  One or more Peer Adjacency Segments MAY be present.

   o  Each of the Peer Node and Peer Adjacency Segment MAY use the same
      Peer-Set.

   While an egress point topology usually refers to eBGP sessions
   between external peers, there's nothing in the extensions defined in
   this document that would prevent the use of these extensions in the
   context of iBGP sessions.

4.  Link NLRI for EPE Connectivity Description

   This section describes the NLRI used for describing the connectivity
   of the BGP Egress router.  The connectivity is based on links and
   remote peers/ASs and therefore the existing Link-Type NLRI (defined
   in [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution]) is used.  A new Protocol ID is
   used (codepoint to be assigned by IANA, suggested value 7).

   The use of a new Protocol-ID allows separation and differentiation
   between the NLRIs carrying BGP-EPE descriptors from the NLRIs
   carrying IGP link-state information as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution].  The Link NLRI Type uses descriptors
   and attributes already defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution] in
   addition to new TLVs defined in the following sections of this
   document.

   The extensions defined in this document apply to both internal and
   external BGP-LS EPE advertisements.

   [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution] defines Link NLRI Type is as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   |                            (64 bits)                          |

   //      Local Node Descriptors                                 //
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   //      Remote Node Descriptors                                //

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      Node Descriptors and Link Descriptors are defined in
      [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution].

4.1.  BGP Router ID and Member ASN

   Two new Node Descriptors Sub-TLVs are defined in this document:

   o  BGP Router Identifier (BGP Router-ID):

         Type: TBA (suggested value 516).

         Length: 4 octets



Previdi, et al.           Expires June 23, 2016                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft    Segment Routing EPE BGP-LS Extensions    December 2015


         Value: 4 octet unsigned integer representing the BGP Identifier
         as defined in [RFC4271] and [RFC6286].

   o  Confederation Member ASN (Member-ASN)

         Type: TBA (suggested value 517).

         Length: 4 octets

         Value: 4 octet unsigned integer representing the Member ASN
         inside the Confederation.[RFC5065].

4.2.  EPE Node Descriptors

   The following Node Descriptors Sub-TLVs MUST appear in the Link NLRI
   as Local Node Descriptors:

   o  BGP Router ID, which contains the BGP Identifier of the local BGP
      EPE node.

   o  Autonomous System Number, which contains the local ASN or local
      confederation identifier (ASN) if confederations are used.

   o  BGP-LS Identifier.

   It has to be noted that [RFC6286] (section 2.1) requires the BGP
   identifier (router-id) to be unique within an Autonomous System.
   Therefore, the <ASN, BGP identifier> tuple is globally unique.

   The following Node Descriptors Sub-TLVs MAY appear in the Link NLRI
   as Local Node Descriptors:

   o  Member-ASN, which contains the ASN of the confederation member
      (when BGP confederations are used).

   o  Node Descriptors as defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution].

   The following Node Descriptors Sub-TLVs MUST appear in the Link NLRI
   as Remote Node Descriptors:

   o  BGP Router ID, which contains the BGP Identifier of the peer node.

   o  Autonomous System Number, which contains the peer ASN or the peer
      confederation identifier (ASN), if confederations are used.

   The following Node Descriptors Sub-TLVs MAY appear in the Link NLRI
   as Remote Node Descriptors:

      (when BGP confederations are used).

   o  Node Descriptors as defined in defined in
      [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution].

4.3.  Link Attributes

   The following BGP-LS Link attributes TLVs are used with the Link
   NLRI:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |V|L|           |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   where:

      *  V-Flag: Value flag.  If set, then the Adj-SID carries a value.
         By default the flag is SET.

      *  L-Flag: Local Flag.  If set, then the value/index carried by
         the Adj-SID has local significance.  By default the flag is
         SET.

      *  Other bits: MUST be zero when originated and ignored when
         received.

   o  Weight: 1 octet.  The value represents the weight of the SID for
      the purpose of load balancing.  An example use of the weight is
      described in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing].

   o  SID/Index/Label.  According to the TLV length and to the V and L
      flags settings, it contains either:

      *  A 3 octet local label where the 20 rightmost bits are used for
         encoding the label value.  In this case the V and L flags MUST
         be set.

      *  A 4 octet index defining the offset in the SID/Label space
         advertised by this router using the encodings defined in
         Section 3.1.  In this case V and L flags MUST be unset.

      *  A 16 octet IPv6 address.  In this case the V flag MUST be set.
         The L flag MUST be unset if the IPv6 address is globally
         unique.

   The values of the Peer-Node-SID, Peer-Adj-SID and Peer-Set-SID Sub-
   TLVs SHOULD be persistent across router restart.

   The Peer-Node-SID MUST be present when BGP-LS is used for the use
   case described in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-central-epe] and
   MAY be omitted for other use cases.

   The Peer-Adj-SID and Peer-Set-SID SubTLVs MAY be present when BGP-LS
   is used for the use case described in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-central-epe] and MAY be omitted for
   other use cases.

   In addition, BGP-LS Nodes and Link Attributes, as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution]MAY be inserted in order to advertise
   the characteristics of the link.

5.  Peer Node and Peer Adjacency Segments

   In this section the following Peer Segments are defined:

      Peer Node Segment (Peer-Node-SID)

      Peer Adjacency Segment (Peer-Adj-SID)

      Peer Set Segment (Peer-Set-SID)

   The Peer Node, Peer Adjacency and Peer Set segments can be either a
   local or a global segment (depending on the setting of the V and L
   flags defined in Figure 2.  For example, when EPE is used in the
   context of a SR network over the IPv6 dataplane, it is likely the
   case that the IPv6 addresses used as SIDs will be global.

5.1.  Peer Node Segment (Peer-Node-SID)

   The Peer Node Segment describes the BGP session peer (neighbor).  It
   MUST be present when describing an EPE topology as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-central-epe].  The Peer Node Segment
   is encoded within the BGP-LS Link NLRI specified in Section 4.

   The Peer Node Segment, at the BGP node advertising it, has the
   following semantic:

   o  SR header operation: NEXT (as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing]).

   o  Next-Hop: the connected peering node to which the segment is
      related.

   The Peer Node Segment is advertised with a Link NLRI, where:

   o  Local Node Descriptors contains

     Local BGP Router ID of the EPE enabled egress PE.
     Local ASN.
     BGP-LS Identifier.

   o  Remote Node Descriptors contains

     Peer BGP Router ID (i.e.: the peer BGP ID used in the BGP session).
     Peer ASN.

   o  Link Descriptors Sub-TLVs, as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution], contain the addresses used by the
      BGP session:

      *  IPv4 Interface Address (Sub-TLV 259) contains the BGP session
         IPv4 local address.

      *  IPv4 Neighbor Address (Sub-TLV 260) contains the BGP session
         IPv4 peer address.

      *  IPv6 Interface Address (Sub-TLV 261) contains the BGP session
         IPv6 local address.

      *  IPv6 Neighbor Address (Sub-TLV 262) contains the BGP session
         IPv6 peer address.

   o  Link Attribute contains the Peer-Node-SID TLV as defined in
      Section 4.3.

   o  In addition, BGP-LS Link Attributes, as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution], MAY be inserted in order to
      advertise the characteristics of the link.

5.2.  Peer Adjacency Segment (Peer-Adj-SID)

   The Peer Adjacency Segment, at the BGP node advertising it, has the
   following semantic:

   o  SR header operation: NEXT (as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing]).

   o  Next-Hop: the interface peer address.

   The Peer Adjacency Segment is advertised with a Link NLRI, where:

   o  Local Node Descriptors contains

      *  Link Local/Remote Identifiers (Sub-TLV 258) contains the
         4-octet Link Local Identifier followed by the 4-octet value 0
         indicating the Link Remote Identifier in unknown [RFC5307].

   o  In addition, Link Descriptors Sub-TLVs, as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution], MAY contain the following TLVs:

      *  IPv4 Interface Address (Sub-TLV 259) contains the address of
         the local interface through which the BGP session is
         established.

      *  IPv6 Interface Address (Sub-TLV 261) contains the address of
         the local interface through which the BGP session is

         of the peer interface used by the BGP session.

   o  Link attribute used with the Peer-Adj-SID contains the TLV as
      defined in Section 4.3.

   In addition, BGP-LS Link Attributes, as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution], MAY be inserted in order to advertise
   the characteristics of the link.

5.3.  Peer Set Segment

   The Peer Adjacency Segment, at the BGP node advertising it, has the
   following semantic:

   o  SR header operation: NEXT (as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing]).

   o  Next-Hop: load balance across any connected interface to any peer
      in the related set.

   The Peer Set Segment is advertised within a Link NLRI (describing a
   Peer Node Segment or a Peer Adjacency segment) as a BGP-LS attribute.

   The Peer Set Attribute contains the Peer-Set-SID TLV, defined in
   Section 4.3 identifying the set of which the Peer Node Segment or
   Peer Adjacency Segment is a member.

6.  Illustration

6.1.  Reference Diagram

   The following reference diagram is used throughout this document.
   The solution is illustrated for IPv4 with MPLS-based segments and the
   EPE topology is based on eBGP sessions between external peers.

   As stated in Section 3, the solution illustrated hereafter is equally
   applicable to an iBGP session topology.  In other words, the solution
   also applies to the case where C, D, H, and E are in the same AS and
   run iBGP sessions between each other.

   IPv4 addressing:

   o  C's IPv4 address of interface to D: 1.0.1.1/24, D's interface:
      1.0.1.2/24

   o  C's IPv4 address of interface to H: 1.0.2.1/24, H's interface:

   o  C's local identifier of upper interface to E: 0.0.0.1.0.0.0.0

   o  C's IPv4 address of lower interface to E: 1.0.4.1/24, E's
      interface: 1.0.4.2/24

   o  C's local identifier of lower interface to E: 0.0.0.2.0.0.0.0

   o  Loopback of E used for eBGP multi-hop peering to C: 1.0.5.2/32

   o  C's loopback is 3.3.3.3/32 with SID 64

   BGP Router-IDs are C, D, H and E.

   o  C's BGP Router-ID: 3.3.3.3

   o  D's BGP Router-ID: 4.4.4.4

   o  E's BGP Router-ID: 5.5.5.5

   o  H's BGP Router-ID: 6.6.6.6

   C's BGP peering:

   o  Single-hop eBGP peering with neighbor 1.0.1.2 (D)

   o  Single-hop eBGP peering with neighbor 1.0.2.2 (H)

   o  Multi-hop eBGP peering with E on ip address 1.0.5.2 (E)

   C's resolution of the multi-hop eBGP session to E:

   o  Static route 1.0.5.2/32 via 1.0.3.2

   o  Static route 1.0.5.2/32 via 1.0.4.2

   Node C configuration is such that:

   o  A Peer Node segment (Peer-Node-SID) is allocated to each peer (D,
      H and E).

   o  An Peer Adjacency segment (Peer-Adj-SID) is defined for each
      recursing interface to a multi-hop peer (CE upper and lower
      interfaces).

   o  A Peer Set segment (Peer-Set-SID) is defined to include all peers
      in AS3 (peers H and E).

   Local BGP-LS Identifier in router C is set to 10000.

   The Link NLRI Type is used in order to encode C's connectivity.  The
   Link NLRI uses the new Protocol-ID value (to be assigned by IANA)

   Once the BGP-LS update is originated by C, it may be advertised to
   internal (iBGP) as well as external (eBGP) neighbors supporting the
   BGP-LS EPE extensions defined in this document.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines:

      Two new Node Descriptors Sub-TLVs: BGP-Router-ID and BGP
      Confederation Member.

      A new Protocol-ID for EPE: BGP-EPE.

      Three new BGP-LS Attribute Sub-TLVs: Peer-Node-SID, Peer-Adj-SID
      and Peer-Set-SID.

   The codepoints are to be assigned by IANA.  The following are the
   suggested values:

     +---------------------+--------------------------+-------------+
     | Suggested Codepoint | Description              | Defined in: |
     +---------------------+--------------------------+-------------+
     |          7          | Protocol-ID              | Section 4   |
     |         516         | BGP Router ID            | Section 4.1 |
     |         517         | BGP Confederation Member | Section 4.1 |
     |         1101        | Peer-Node-SID            | Section 4.3 |
     |         1102        | Peer-Adj-SID             | Section 4.3 |
     |         1103        | Peer-Set-SID             | Section 4.3 |

8.  Manageability Considerations

   TBD

9.  Security Considerations

   [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution] defines BGP-LS NLRIs to which the
   extensions defined in this document apply.

   The Security Section of [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution] also applies
   to:

   o  New Node Descriptors Sub-TLVs: BGP-Router-ID and BGP-
      Confederation-Member;

   o  New BGP-LS Attributes TLVs: Peer-Node-SID, Peer-Adj-SID and Peer-
      Set-SID.
