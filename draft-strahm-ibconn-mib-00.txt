  3. The SNMP Management Framework 
    
      The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major   
      components: 
    
       o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571[RFC2571]. 
    
       o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for 
           the purpose of management.  The first version of this 
           Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 
           and described in STD 16, RFC 1155[RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 
           [RFC1212] and RFC 1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, 
           called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578[RFC2578], STD 
           58, RFC 2579[RFC2579], and STD 58, RFC 2580[RFC2580]. 
    
       o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  
           The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called 
           SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC 1157[RFC1157].  A second 
           version of the SNMP message protocol, which is not an 
           Internet standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and 
           described in RFC 1901[RFC1901] and RFC 1906[RFC1906].  The 
           third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and 
           described in RFC 1906[RFC1906], RFC 2572[RFC2572] and RFC 
           2574[RFC2574]. 
    
       o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  
           The first set of protocol operations and associated PDU 
           formats is described in STD 15, RFC 1157[RFC1157].  A second 
           set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is 
           described in RFC 1905[RFC1905]. 
    
       o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 
           2573[RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism 
           described in RFC 2575[RFC2575]. 
    
      A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management 
     Framework can be found in RFC 2570[RFC2570]. 
    
      Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
     termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB 
     are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI. 
    
      This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.   
     A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the 
     appropriate translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be 
     semantically equivalent, except where objects or events are 
     omitted because no translation is possible (use of Counter64).  
     Some machine readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into 
     textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.  
     However, this loss of machine readable information is not 
     considered to change the semantics of the MIB.

  4. Conventions used in this document 
    
     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
     NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and 
     "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in 
     RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 
    
  5. Overview 
      
     The Infiniband Architecture[IBTAArch] is defined by the Infiniband 
     Trade Association.  Infiniband is designed to provide low latency 
     high bandwidth interconnect in a computing environment.  This 
     document will define the objects related to the connection 
     manager, managing the transports above layer 3 which are defined 
     in the Infiniband MIB[IBIFMIB] 
      
     The Infiniband Architecture defines five transports above 
     Infiniband: Raw, Unreliable Connected, Reliable Connected, 
     Unreliable Datagram, and Reliable Datagram.   
      
     Raw packets are not normal usage and therefore will not be covered 
     in this document.  Infiniband goes so far as to specify hardware 
     that has the ability to discard all Raw packets in hardware on 
     reception.   
      
     The datagram tables can not be combined because the Unreliable 
     Datagram service provides a simple listening service much like 
     UDP, and the Reliable Connected service uses the concept of an 
     End-End context to allow multiple Queue pairs behind the EEC to 
     connect over a single reliability context saving resources on the 
     Channel Adapter. 
      
     The connection tables are combined because the only differences 
     between the data is that a reliability layer is provided in 
     hardware for the Reliable Connected service.  This is handled by 
     the single ibConnCReliable object. 
      
  5.1.     Unreliable Datagram Table 
     The unreliable datagram service in Infiniband is not required to 
     go through the Connection Manager, and therefore no state is kept.  
     For this reason the MIB will just track what Queue Pair Numbers 
     the channel adapter is listening to.   
    
  5.2.     Reliable Datagram Table 
     The reliable datagram service in Infiniband uses the Connection 
     Management service to connect two endpoints through an End to End 
     Context (EEC).  This EEC can be used to connect multiple Queue 
     Pairs, from multiple applications on each machine to the other 
     side without having to maintain state on a separate EEC for each 
     Queue pair.

  5.3.     Connection Table 
     The connection table is used to display connections between end 
     applications.  Each connection includes data indicating if the 
     connection is reliable or unreliable, and what state the 
     connection is in. 
    
  6. Next Steps 
     Currently the following questions need to be dealt with 
        1. What should be done with RAW IB packets û currently nothing 
        2. A compliance section needs to be added 
        3. What interface(s) might be used by an implementation to get 
          this information from the Connection Manager 
        4. Where do the Unreliable Datagram values come from 
        5. A ibifMIB value needs to be allocated by the IpoverIB WG. 
        6. Use textual conventions where possible from the IB IF MIB 
          document

  8. Security Considerations 
    
     There are no management objects defined in this MIB that have a 
     MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this 
     MIB is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an 
     intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB 
     via direct SNMP SET operations. 
      
     There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain 
     sensitive information.  It is thus important to control even GET 
     access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of 
     these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.  Not 
     all versions of SNMP provide features for such a secure 
     environment. 
      
     SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network   
     itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is 
     no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access 
     and   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.  
     It is recommended that the implementers consider the security 
     features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the 
     use of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the 
     View-based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] are 
     recommended. 
      
     It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP   
     entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly   
     configured to give access to the objects only to those principals 
     (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET 
     (change/create/delete) them. 
    
    
  9. Intellectual Property  
    
     The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any 
     intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to 
     pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described 
     in   this document or the extent to which any license under such 
     rights   might or might not be available; neither does it 
     represent that it   has made any effort to identify any such 
     rights.  Information on the IETF's procedures with respect to 
     rights in standards-track and   standards-related documentation 
     can be found in BCP-11.  Copies of   claims of rights made 
     available for publication and any assurances of licenses to be 
     made available, or the result of an attempt made to obtain a 
     general license or permission for the use of such proprietary 
     rights by implementers or users of this specification can be 
     obtained from the IETF Secretariat. 
    
     The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention 
     any copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other
