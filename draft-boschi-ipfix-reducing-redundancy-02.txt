               Reducing redundancy in IPFIX and PSAMP reports 

     Abstract 
         
        This document describes a bandwidth saving method for exporting 
        flow or packet information using the IP Flow Information Export 
        (IPFIX) protocol. As the PSAMP protocol is based on IPFIX, these 
        considerations are valid for PSAMP exports as well. 
         
        This method works by separating information common to several 
        flow records from information specific to an individual flow 
        record. Common flow information is exported only once in a data 
        record defined by an option template, while the rest of the 
        specific flow information is associated with the common 
        information via a unique identifier.

     1. Introduction 
         
        The IPFIX working group has specified a protocol to export IP 
        Flow information [IPFIX-PROTO]. This protocol is designed to 
        export information about IP traffic flows and related 
        measurement data, where a flow is defined by a set of key 
        attributes (e.g. source and destination IP address, source and 
        destination port, etc.). However, thanks to its template 
        mechanism, the IPFIX protocol can export any type of 
        information, as long as the information element is specified in 
        [IPFIX-INFO] or registered with IANA. 
         
        Regardless of the flow attributes content, flow records with 
        common attributes export the same values in every single flow 
        record.  These common attributes may represent values common to 
        a collection of flows or packets, or values that are invariant 
        over time. The reduction of redundant data from the export 
        stream can result in a significant reduction of the transferred 
        data. 
      
        This draft specifies a way to export these invariant or common 
        attributes only once, while the rest of the flow specific 
        attributes are exported in regular data records. Unique common 
        properties identifiers are used to link data records and the 
        common attributes. 
      
        The proposed method is applicable to IPFIX flow and to PSAMP per 
        packet information, without any changes to both the IPFIX and 
        PSAMP protocol specifications. 
      
      
     1.1 IPFIX Documents Overview 
      
        The IPFIX protocol [IPFIX-PROTO] provides network administrators 
        with access to IP flow information.  The architecture for the 
        export of measured IP flow information out of an IPFIX exporting 
        process to a collecting process is defined in [IPFIX-ARCH], per 
        the requirements defined in [RFC3917].  This document specifies 
        how IPFIX data record and templates are carried via a 
        congestion-aware transport protocol from IPFIX exporting 
        processes to IPFIX collecting process.  IPFIX has a formal 
        description of IPFIX information elements, their name, type and 
        additional semantic information, as specified in [IPFIX-INFO].  
        Finally [IPFIX-AS] describes what type of applications can use 
        the IPFIX protocol and how they can use the information 
        provided.  It furthermore shows how the IPFIX framework relates 
        to other architectures and frameworks.  
         
         
     1.2 PSAMP Documents Overview 
      
        The document "A Framework for Packet Selection and Reporting" 
        [PSAMP-FMWK], describes the PSAMP framework for network elements 
        to select subsets of packets by statistical and other methods, 
        and to export a stream of reports on the selected packets to a 
        collector. The set of packet selection techniques (sampling, 
        filtering, and hashing) supported by PSAMP are described in 
        "Sampling and Filtering Techniques for IP Packet Selection" 
        [PSAMP-TECH]. The PSAMP protocol [PSAMP-PROTO] specifies the 
        export of packet information from a PSAMP exporting process to a

               Reducing redundancy in IPFIX and PSAMP reports 

        PSAMP collecting process. Like IPFIX, PSAMP has a formal 
        description of its information elements, their name, type and 
        additional semantic information. The PSAMP information model is 
        defined in [PSAMP-INFO]. Finally [PSAMP-MIB] describes the PSAMP 
        Management Information Base. 
      
      
     2. Terminology 
      
        The terms in this section are in line with the IPFIX terminology 
        section [IPFIX-PROTO], and [PSAMP-PROTO]. Note that this 
        document selected the IPFIX definition of the term Exporting 
        Process [IPFIX-PROTO], as this definition is more generic than 
        the PSAMP definition [PSAMP-PROTO]. 
         
        Observation Point 
         
            An Observation Point is a location in the network where IP 
            packets can be observed.  Examples include: a line to which 
            a probe is attached, a shared medium, such as an Ethernet-
            based LAN, a single port of a router, or a set of 
            interfaces (physical or logical) of a router. 
             
            Note that every Observation Point is associated with an 
            Observation Domain (defined below), and that one 
            Observation Point may be a superset of several other 
            Observation Points.  For example one Observation Point can 
            be an entire line card.  That would be the superset of the 
            individual Observation Points at the line card's 
            interfaces. 
         
        Observation Domain 
         
            An Observation Domain is the largest set of Observation 
            Points for which Flow information can be aggregated by a 
            Metering Process.  For example, a router line card may be 
            an Observation Domain if it is composed of several 
            interfaces, each of which is an Observation Point. In the 
            IPFIX Message it generates, the Observation Domain includes 
            its Observation Domain ID, which is unique per Exporting 
            Process.  That way, the Collecting Process can identify the 
            specific Observation Domain from the Exporter that sends 
            the IPFIX Messages. Every Observation Point is associated 
            with an Observation Domain. It is RECOMMENDED that 
            Observation Domain IDs are also unique per IPFIX Device. 
         
        IP Traffic Flow or Flow 
         
            There are several definitions of the term 'flow' being used 
            by the Internet community.  Within the context of IPFIX we 
            use the following definition: 
             
            A Flow is defined as a set of IP packets passing an 
            Observation Point in the network during a certain time 
            interval.  All packets belonging to a particular Flow have 
            a set of common properties.  Each property is defined as 
            the result of applying a function to the values of: 
             
               1. one or more packet header field (e.g. destination IP    
            address), transport header field (e.g. destination port 
            number), or application header field (e.g. RTP header 
            fields [RFC1889]) 
             
               2. one or more characteristics of the packet itself 
            (e.g. number of MPLS labels, etc...)

               Reducing redundancy in IPFIX and PSAMP reports 

               3. one or more of fields derived from packet treatment 
            (e.g. next hop IP address, the output interface, etc...) 
             
            A packet is defined to belong to a Flow if it completely 
            satisfies all the defined properties of the Flow. 
             
            This definition covers the range from a Flow containing all 
            packets observed at a network interface to a Flow 
            consisting of just a single packet between two 
            applications.  It includes packets selected by a sampling 
            mechanism. 
         
        Flow Record 
         
            A Flow Record contains information about a specific Flow 
            that was observed at an Observation Point.  A Flow Record 
            contains measured properties of the Flow (e.g. the total 
            number of bytes for all the Flow's packets) and usually 
            characteristic properties of the Flow (e.g. source IP 
            address).  
      
        Metering Process 
         
            The Metering Process generates Flow Records.  Inputs to the 
            process are packet headers and characteristics observed at 
            an Observation Point, and packet treatment at the 
            Observation Point (for example the selected output 
            interface). 
             
            The Metering Process consists of a set of functions that 
            includes packet header capturing, timestamping, sampling, 
            classifying, and maintaining Flow Records. 
             
            The maintenance of Flow Records may include creating new 
            records, updating existing ones, computing Flow statistics, 
            deriving further Flow properties, detecting Flow 
            expiration, passing Flow Records to the Exporting Process, 
            and deleting Flow Records. 
             
        Exporting Process 
         
            The Exporting Process sends Flow Records to one or more 
            Collecting Processes.  The Flow Records are generated by 
            one or more Metering Processes. 
             
        Exporter 
         
            A device which hosts one or more Exporting Processes is 
            termed an Exporter.  
             
        IPFIX Device 
             
            An IPFIX Device hosts at least one Exporting Process.  It 
            may host further Exporting processes and arbitrary numbers 
            of Observation Points and Metering Process. 
      
        Collecting Process 
         
            A Collecting Process receives Flow Records from one or more 
            Exporting Processes.  The Collecting Process might process 
            or store received Flow Records, but such actions are out of

               Reducing redundancy in IPFIX and PSAMP reports 

            Template is an ordered sequence of <type, length> pairs, 
            used to completely specify the structure and semantics of a 
            particular set of information that needs to be communicated 
            from an IPFIX Device to a Collector.  Each Template is 
            uniquely identifiable by means of a Template ID. 
             
        Template Record 
         
            A Template Record defines the structure and interpretation 
            of fields in a Data Record. 
         
        Data Record 
         
            A Data Record is a record that contains values of the 
            parameters corresponding to a Template Record.  
         
        Options Template Record 
         
            An Options Template Record is a Template Record that 
            defines the structure and interpretation of fields in a 
            Data Record, including defining how to scope the 
            applicability of the Data Record. 
         
        Set 
         
            Set is a generic term for a collection of records that have 
            a similar structure.  In an IPFIX Message, one or more Sets 
            follow the Message Header. 
             
            There are three different types of Sets: Template Set, 
            Options Template Set, and Data Set.  
          
        Template Set 
         
            A Template Set is a collection of one or more Template 
            Records that have been grouped together in an IPFIX 
            Message.  
          
        Options Template Set 
         
            An Options Template Set is a collection of one or more 
            Options Template Records that have been grouped together in 
            an IPFIX Message. 
         
        Data Set 
         
            A Data Set is one or more Data Records, of the same type, 
            that are grouped together in an IPFIX Message.  Each Data 
            Record is previously defined by a Template Record or an 
            Options Template Record. 
         
        Information Element 
             
            An Information Element is a protocol and encoding 
            independent description of an attribute which may appear in 
            an IPFIX Record.  The IPFIX information model [IPFIX-INFO] 
            defines the base set of Information Elements for IPFIX.  
            The type associated with an Information Element indicates 
            constraints on what it may contain and also determines the 
            valid encoding mechanisms for use in IPFIX. 
      
        Observed Packet Stream 
              
            The Observed Packet Stream is the set of all packets 
            observed at the Observation Point.

               Reducing redundancy in IPFIX and PSAMP reports 

        Packet Content 
              
            The packet content denotes the union of the packet header 
            (which includes link layer, network layer and other 
            encapsulation headers) and the packet payload. 
             
        Selection Process 
              
            A Selection Process takes the Observed Packet Stream as its 
            input and selects a subset of that stream as its output. 
             
        Selector 
              
            A Selector defines the action of a Selection Process on a 
            single packet of its input.  If selected, the packet 
            becomes an element of the output Packet Stream. 
                     
            The Selector can make use of the following information in 
            determining whether a packet is selected: 
                     
                (i)   the Packet Content; 
                       
                (ii)  information derived from the packet's treatment 
                      at the Observation Point; 
                       
                (iii) any selection state that may be maintained by the  
                      Selection Process. 
      
        PSAMP Device 
              
            A PSAMP Device is a device hosting at least an Observation 
            Point, a Selection Process and an Exporting Process.  
            Typically, corresponding Observation Point(s), Selection 
            Process(es) and Exporting Process(es) are co-located at 
            this device, for example at a router. 
         
        Filtering 
              
            A filter is a Selector that selects a packet 
            deterministically based on the Packet Content, or its 
            treatment, or functions of these occurring in the Selection 
            State.  Examples include field match Filtering, and Hash-
            based Selection. 
         
        CommonPropertiesID 
         
            An identifier of a set of common properties that is locally 
            unique to an Exporting Process and to Observation Domain. 
            This ID can be used to link to information reported in 
            separate records. See [IPFIX-INFO] for the Information 
            Element definition. 
             
        Common Properties 
         
            Common Properties are a collection of one or more 
            attributes shared by a set of different Flow Records. Each 
            set of Common Properties is uniquely identifiable by means 
            of a commonPropertiesID. 
             
        Specific Properties 
         
            Specific Properties are a collection of one or more 
            attributes reported in a Flow Record that are not included 
            in the Common Properties defined for that Flow Record.

        Figure 1: Terminology Summary Table 
         
        A Data Set is composed of Data Record(s).  No Template Record is 
        included.  A Template Record or an Options Template Record 
        defines the Data Record. 
         
        A Template Set contains only Template Record(s).   
         
        An Options Template Set contains only Options Template 
        Record(s).   
         
         
     2.2 IPFIX Flows versus PSAMP Packets 
      
        As described in [PSAMP-PROTO], the major difference between 
        IPFIX and PSAMP is that the IPFIX protocol exports Flow Records 
        while the PSAMP protocol exports Packet Records.  From a pure 
        export point of view, IPFIX will not distinguish a Flow Record 
        composed of several packets aggregated together from a Flow 
        Record composed of a single packet.  So the PSAMP export can be 
        seen as special IPFIX Flow Record containing information about a 
        single packet.  
         
        For this document clarity, the term Flow Record represents a 
        generic term expressing an IPFIX Flow Record or a PSAMP packet 
        record, as foreseen by its definition. However, when 
        appropriate, a clear distinction between Flow Record or packet 
        Record will be made. 
      
         
         
     3. Problem Statement and High Level Solution 
      
        Several Flow Records often share a set of common properties. 
        Repeating the information about these common properties for 
        every Flow Record introduces a huge amount of redundancy. This 
        draft proposes a method to reduce this redundancy. The next 
        section describes the generic concept. Section 3.1.2 identifies 
        that the proposed solution can be applied multiple times. 
        Section 3.2 utilizes the concept to export per-packet 
        information. 
          
     3.1 Per Flow Data Reduction 
         
     3.1.1  Unique Data Reduction 
         
      
        Consider a set of properties "A", e.g. common sourceAddressA and 
        sourcePortA, equivalent for each Flow Records exported. Figure 2

               Reducing redundancy in IPFIX and PSAMP reports 

        shows how this information is repeated with classical IPFIX Flow 
        Records, expressing the waste of bandwidth to export redundant 
        information.

        |      ...       |     ...     |            ...            | 
        +----------------+-------------+---------------------------+ 
         
        Figure 2: Common and Specific Properties exported in the same 
        record 
         
         
        Figure 3 shows how this information is exported when applying 
        the specifications of this document.  The Common Properties are 
        separated from the Specific Properties for each Flow Record.  
        The Common Properties would be exported only once in a specific 
        Data Record (defined by an Option Template), while each Flow 
        Record contains a pointer to the Common Properties A, along with 
        its Flow specific information.  In order to maintain the 
        relationship between these sets of properties, we introduce 
        indices (index A) for the Common Properties that are unique for 
        all Common Properties entries within an Observation Domain. The 
        purpose of the indices is to serve as a "key" identifying "rows" 
        of the Common Properties table. The rows are then referenced by 
        the Specific Properties by using the appropriate value for the 
        Common Properties identifier.  
         
         
        +------------------------+-----------------+-------------+ 
        | index for properties A | sourceAddressA  | sourcePortA | 
        +------------------------+-----------------+-------------+ 
        |          ...           |      ...        |     ...     | 
        +------------------------+-----------------+-------------+ 
         
         
        +------------------------+---------------------------+ 
        | index for properties A |     <flow1 information>   | 
        +------------------------+---------------------------+ 
        | index for properties A |     <flow2 information>   | 
        +------------------------+---------------------------+ 
        | index for properties A |     <flow3 information>   | 
        +------------------------+---------------------------+ 
        | index for properties A |     <flow4 information>   | 
        +------------------------+---------------------------+ 
         
        Figure 3: Common and Specific Properties exported in different 
        records 
         
        This unique export of the Common Properties results in a 
        decrease of the bandwidth requirements from the Exporter to the 
        Collector. 
         
     3.1.2  Multiple Data Reduction 
      
        A Flow Record can refer to one or more Common Properties sets; 
        the use of multiple Common Properties can lead to more efficient 
        exports.  Note that in the case of multiple Common Properties, 
        the different sets of Common Properties MUST be disjoint (i.e. 
                                                         
     Boschi, Mark, Claise      Expires December 2006           [Page 9] 
               Reducing redundancy in IPFIX and PSAMP reports 

        MUST not have information elements in common), to avoid 
        potential collisions. 
      
        Consider a set of properties "A", e.g. common sourceAddressA and 
        sourcePortA and another set of properties "B", e.g. 
        destinationAddressB and destinationPortB. Figure 4 shows how 
        this information is repeated with classical IPFIX export in 
        several Flow Records.

        Figure 4: Common and Specific Properties exported in the same 
        record 
         
        We can separate the Common Properties into the properties A 
        composed of sourceAddressA and sourcePortA, and into the 
        properties B composed of destinationAddressB and 
        destinationPortB.  The Flow Record that only contain the 
        property A will only contain the index for property A, the Flow 
        Record that only contain the property B will contain the index 
        for property B, while the Flow Record that contain both the 
        properties A and B contains both indexes (see Figure 5).

        Figure 5: Multiple Common (above) and Specific Properties 
        (below) exported in different records 
         
        The advantage of the multiple Common Properties is that the 
        objective of reducing the bandwidth is met while the number of 
        index is kept to a minimum. Indeed, an alternative solution 
        would have been to have an extra index for the property C, 
        composed of sourceAddressA, sourcePortA, destinationAddressB, 
        destinationPortB.

               Reducing redundancy in IPFIX and PSAMP reports 

      
     3.2 Per Packet Data Reduction 
      
        The PSAMP protocol can be used for the export of per-packet 
        information. In this case the specific packet of observation 
        could be considered a special case of a Flow (a Flow Record 
        composed of a single packet) and consequently per-packet 
        information could be exported using Flow Records. However, if 
        filtering is applied to select a subset of all packets, using 
        IPFIX to export per-packet information is relatively inefficient 
        since all packets belonging to the same series share common 
        attributes (e.g. source address, destination address, etc). 
         
        A first example of the per packet data reduction is the 
        measurement of One-Way Delay (OWD), where the exact same 
        specific packet must be observed at the source and destination 
        of the path to be measured. By subtracting the time of 
        observation of the same packet at the two end points with 
        synchronized clocks, the OWD is computed. As the OWD is measured 
        for a specific application on which a Service Level Agreement 
        (SLA) is bound, this translates into the observation of packets 
        with specific properties, results of filtering.  For example, 
        all the packets of a specific source and destination IP 
        addresses, of a specific DSCP value, and of a specific 
        destination transport port.  In order to match the identical 
        packet at both Observation Points, a series of packets with 
        those properties must be observed on both ends of the 
        measurements. This implies the export of a series of Flow 
        Records composed of two types of information: some common 
        information for all packets, and some unique information about 
        packets in order to generate a unique identifier for each packet 
        passing this Observation Point (for example, a hash value on the 
        invariant fields of the packet).  So, the two IPFIX Devices 
        composing the measurements end points can individually apply the 
        redundancy technique described in this draft in order to save 
        some bandwidth for the Flow Records export. 
         
        A second example of per packet data reduction is trajectory 
        sampling.

        Figure 6, which displays the high level solution for the per 
        packet reduction, depicts three packets belonging to Flow A (and 
        therefore sharing the set of Common Properties A) and one packet 
        belonging to Flow B, respectively. It shows export records 
        containing packet specific information and the Common Properties 
        (source and destination address). The Common Properties 
        introduce a huge amount of redundancy, as they are repeated for 
        every packet in every Data Record.

     4. Specifications for bandwidth saving information export 
         
        The IPFIX protocol [IPFIX-PROTO] is Template based.  Templates 
        define how data should be exported, describing data fields 
        together with their type and meaning.  IPFIX specifies two types 
        of Templates: the Template Record and the Options Template 
        Record.  The difference between the two is that the Options 
        Template Record includes the notion of scope, defining how to 
        scope the applicability of the Data Record.  The scope, which is 
        only available in the Options Template Record, gives the context 
        of the reported Information Elements in the Data Records.  The 
        Template Records and Options Template Records are necessary to 
        decode the Data Records.  Indeed, by only looking at the Data 
        Records themselves, this is impossible to distinguish a Data 
        Record defined by Template Record from a Data Record defined by 
        an Option Template Record.  To export information more 
        efficiently, this specification proposes to group Flow Records 
        by their common properties.  We define Common Properties as a 
        collection of attributes shared by a set of different Flow 
        Records.

     4.1 Per Flow Data Reduction 
         
     4.1.1  Unique Data Reduction 
         
         
        As explained in Figure 8, the information is split into two 
        parts, using two different Data Records.  Common Properties MUST 
        be exported via Data Records defined by an Option Template 
        Record and MUST be sent only once with SCTP and TCP. These 
        properties represent values common to several Flow Records (e.g. 
        IP source and destination address).  The Common Properties Data 
        Records MUST be sent prior to the corresponding Specific 
        Properties Data Records.  The Data Records reporting Specific 
        Properties MUST be associated with the Data Records reporting 
        the Common Properties using a unique identifier for the Common 
        Properties, the commonPropertiesID Information Element.  The 
        commonPropertiesID MUST be exported as the scope in the Options 
        Template Record, and also exported in the associated Template 
        Record.

        The Common Properties are valid for all Flow Records containing 
        the associated commonPropertiesID. Since the commonPropertiesID 
        is a 64-bit data type, this method limits the number of active 
        data reduction to 2**64 per Exporting Process and Observation 
        Domain. 
        The assignment of Flow Records to common attributes could be 
        alternatively provided by the templateID Information Element 
        (instead of the commonPropertiesID Information Element). In this 
        case, the scope in the Common Properties Option Template Record 
        must contain the Template ID used in the Specific Properties 
        Template Record, as displayed in Figure 9.  The Common 
        Properties are valid for all data records of the specified 
        Template. In this case the use of commonPropertiesID is not 
        required.

        From the IPFIX protocol, there are no differences between the 
        Flow Record or per packet record data reduction, except maybe 
        the terminology where the Specific Properties could be called 
        packet specific properties in the following Figure 11.

     5. Transport Protocol Choice 
         
        This document follows the IPFIX transport protocol 
        specifications defined in [IPFIX-PROTO]. However, depending on 
        the transport protocol choice, this document imposes some more 
        constraints. If SCTP is selected as the IPFIX protocol, the SCTP 
        sub-section specifications MUST be respected. If UDP is selected 
        as the IPFIX protocol, the UDP sub-section specifications MUST 
        be respected.  If TCP is selected as the IPFIX protocol, the TCP 
        sub-section specifications MUST be respected.      
         
     5.1 SCTP 
      
        The active Common Properties MUST be sent after the SCTP 
        association establishment before the corresponding Specific 
        Properties Data Records.  In case of SCTP association re-
        establishment, all active Common Properties MUST be re-sent 
        before the corresponding Specific Properties Data Records. 
         
        The Common Properties Flow Records MUST be sent on a reliable 
        SCTP stream.  
         
     5.2 UDP 
      
        Common Properties Data Records MUST be re-sent at regular 
        intervals, whose frequency MUST be configurable. 
        CommonPropertiesIDs have a specified lifetime during which they 
        cannot be reused. After that time a commonPropertiesID can be 
        assigned to another set of Common Properties. CommonPropertiesID 
        whose lifetime has longer expired SHOULD be preferred. The 
        lifetime MUST be configurable. 
         
         
     5.3 TCP 
      
        Common Properties MUST be sent after the TCP connection 
        establishment before the corresponding Specific Properties Data 
        Records.  In case of TCP connection re-establishment, all active 
        Common Properties MUST be re-sent before the corresponding 
        Specific Properties Data Records.

     6. commonPropertiesID Management 
         
        The commonPropertiesID is an identifier of a set of common 
        properties that is locally unique to an Exporting Process and to 
        Observation Domain. The Exporting Process MUST manage the 
        commonPropertiesIDs allocations for its Observation Domains. 
        Different Observation Domains from the same Exporter MAY use the 
        same commonPropertiesID value to refer to different sets of 
        Common Properties. 
         
        The commonPropertiesID values MAY be assigned sequentially, but 
        itњs NOT REQUIRED. Particular commonPropertiesID ranges or   
        values MAY have explicit meanings for the IPFIX Device. For 
        example, commonPropertiesID values may be assigned based on the 
        result of a hash function, etc...  
         
        Using a 64-bit commonPropertiesID Information Element allows the 
        export of 2**64 -1 active sets of Common Properties, per 
        Observation Domain, per Exporting Process.  
         
        CommonPropertiesIDs that are not used anymore SHOULD be 
        withdrawn. The Common Properties ID withdrawal message is an 
        Option Data Record consisting of only one scope field namely the 
        CommonPropertiesID and no non-scope fields.

     7. The Collecting Process Side 
         
         
        The Collecting Process can either store the Flow Records as they 
        arrive, without reconstructing the initial Flow Record, or 
        reconstruct the initial Flow Record. In the former case there 
        might be less storage capacity required at the Collector side. 
        In the latter the collector job is more complex and time-
        consuming due to the higher resource demand for record

               Reducing redundancy in IPFIX and PSAMP reports 

        Like TemplateIDs the CommonPropertiesIDs are generated 
        dynamically by the Exporting Process. The CommonPropertiesIDs 
        are only valid within the protocol stack. Hence a restart of the 
        exporting process may imply a renumbering of CommonProperiesIDs. 
        For this reason it is not recommended to use the 
        CommonPropertiesIds outside the protocol stack e.g. to store 
        them within a database. Outside the protocol stack there is 
        additional information needed to keep a non-ambiguous 
        association between the related Common Properties and Specific 
        Properties. 
         
        If the Collecting Process has received the Specific Properties 
        Data Record before the associated Common Properties Data Record, 
        the Collecting Process MAY store the Specific Properties Data 
        Record and await the retransmission or out-of-order arrival of 
        the Common Properties Data Record. 
         
        If a Collection Process receives a CommonPropertiesID Withdraw 
        Record, the Collection Process MUST expire the related Common 
        Properties data. 
         
        If SCTP is selected as the IPFIX protocol, the SCTP sub-section 
        specifications MUST be respected. If UDP is selected as the 
        IPFIX protocol, the UDP sub-section specifications MUST be 
        respected.  If TCP is selected as the IPFIX protocol, the TCP 
        sub-section specifications MUST be respected.      
         
     7.1 SCTP 
         
        When the SCTP association is reset, either gracefully or 
        abnormally, the Collecting Processes MUST delete all 
        commonPropertiesID values associated with that association. 
          
     7.2 UDP 
         
        The Collecting Process associates a lifetime with each 
        commonPropertiesID. The mapping of Data Records to Common 
        Properties uses the most recent Common Properties definition 
        associated to the specified commonPropertiesID. The lifetime of 
        the CommonPropertiesID ends on the receipt of a 
        CommonPropertiesID withdrawal record. If there is no flow 
        definition associated with that commonPropertiesID or the 
        lifetime of the flow definition has expired, no mapping is 
        possible. In this case the Collecting Process MAY store the 
        Specific Properties and await the retransmission or out-of-order 
        arrival of the Common Properties.  
      
     7.3 TCP 
         
        When the TCP connection is reset, either gracefully or 
        abnormally, the Collecting Processes MUST expire all 
        commonPropertiesID values corresponding to that connection. 
      
         
     8. Export and Evaluation Considerations 
         
        The main advantage of the method specified in this document is 
        the reduction in the amount of measurement data that has to be 
        transferred from the Exporter to the Collector. In addition 
        there might be less storage capacity required at the Collector 
        side if the Collector decides to store the Flow Records as they 
        arrive, without reconstructing the initial Flow Record.  
         
        On the other hand, these methods require additional resources on 
        both the Exporter and the Collector. The Exporter has to manage 
        Common Properties information and to assign commonPropertiesId

               Reducing redundancy in IPFIX and PSAMP reports 

        values to Flow Records. The Collector has to process records 
        described by two templates instead of just one. Additional 
        effort is also required when post processing the measurement 
        data, in order to correlate Flow Records with Common Properties 
        information. 
         
     8.1 Transport Protocol Choice 
         
        The proposed method is most effective using a reliable transport 
        protocol for the transfer of the Common Properties. Therefore 
        the use of SCTP or TCP is recommended. However, if the path from 
        the Exporting Process to the Collecting Process is not fully 
        reliable, the SCTP or TCP retransmission might reduce the 
        benefits of this specification. If the path from the Exporting 
        Process to the Collecting Process is full reliable, the use of 
        UDP is less effective because the common properties have to be 
        re-sent regularly. 
         
     8.2 Reduced Size Encoding 
         
        The transfer of the CommonPropertiesIDs originates some 
        overhead. Note that IPFIX allows reduced-size encoding of 
        Information Elements. In cases where the range of the 
        commonPropertiesID can be restricted, reduced-size encoding can 
        be applied also to the commonPropertiesID, and would result in a 
        further bandwidth efficiency gain.  
         
     8.3 CommonPropertiesID vs. TemplateID scope 
         
        The assignment of Flow Records to common attributes could be 
        done via the CommonPropertiesID and alternatively via the 
        templateID Information Element. In the second case the 
        commonPropertiesID is not required: this reduces the overhead 
        but the Exporting Process must use one templateID per set of 
        Common Properties. In the general case, this method is not 
        scalable, but it can be suitable for certain applications.  
         
     8.4 Efficiency Gain 
         
        The example in section 11.2 below uses IPFIX to export 
        measurement data for each received packet. In that case, for a 
        flow of 1000 packets the amount of data can be decreased more 
        than 33 percent. 
         
        While the goal of this specification is to reduce the bandwidth, 
        the efficiency might be limited.   Indeed, the efficiency gain 
        is based on the numerous redundant information in flows.  While 
        the Exporting Process can evaluate the direct gain for the Flow 
        Records to be exported, it canњt predict whether future Flow 
        Records would contain the information specified by active 
        commonPropertiesID values.  This implies that the efficiency 
        factor of this specification is higher for specific applications 
        where filtering is involved, such as one-way delay or trajectory 
        sampling.  
      
         
     9. IANA Considerations 
         
        This document has no actions for IANA. 
          
         
     10. Security Considerations 
         
        For the proposed use of the IPFIX protocol for bandwidth-saving 
        export the security considerations as for the IPFIX protocol 
        apply.

     11.1.1 Unique Data Reduction  
         
      
        In this section we show how flow information can be exported 
        efficiently using the method described in this draft. Let's 
        suppose we have to periodically export data about two IPv6 
        Flows.  
         
        In this example we report the following information: 
         
         
         
        Flow|        dstIPv6Address                 | dst- |nPkts|nBytes 
            |                                       | Port |     |

            |                                       |      |     |       
         A  |5F05:2000:80AD:5800:0058:0800:2023:1D71|  80  | 50  |  9500

         B  |5F05:2000:80AD:5800:0058:00AA:00B7:AF2B| 1932 | 60  |  8000 
            |                                       |      |     |

            |                                       |      |     |       
         A  |5F05:2000:80AD:5800:0058:0800:2023:1D71|  80  | 60  |  9500 
            |                                       |      |     |

        The Common Properties in this case are the destination IPv6 
        address and the destination port. We first define an Option 
        Template that contains the following Information Elements:  
           
          -  Scope: the commonPropertiesID, with a type of 137 [IPFIX-
            INFO] and a length of 8 octets. 
      
          - The destination IPv6 address, destinationIPv6Address 
            [IPFIX-INFO], with a type of 28 and a length of 16 octets 
           
          -  The destination port, destinationTransportPort [IPFIX-INFO] 
            with a type of 11, and a length of 2 octets 
           
        Figure 14 shows the Option template defining the Common 
        Properties with commonPropertiesID as scope:

        The Specific Properties Template consists of the information not 
        contained in the Option Templates, i.e. flow specific 
        information, in this case the number of packets and the number 
        of bytes to be reported.  Additionally, this Template contains 
        the commonPropertiesID. In Data Records, the value of this field 
        will contain one of the unique indices of the Option Records 
        exported before. It contains the following Information Elements

     11.1.2 Multiple Data Reduction  
         
        In this example we export the following flow information: 
         
         
        Flow | srcAddr | srcPort | dstAddr | dstPort | nPackets | nBytes 
        ----------------------------------------------------------------

        Figure 18 shows the Option Templates, containing the Common 
        Properties together with the commonPropertiesID as Scope.  
         
        In the first Common Properties Option Template we export the 
        following Information Elements: 
         
          -  Scope 1: the Common Properties ID, commonPropertiesId with 
            a type of 137 [IPFIX-INFO]. Note that the commonProperties 
            IE has a length of 8 octets, but if smaller size is 
            sufficient to carry any value the Exporter may need to 
            deliver, reduced size encoding can be used. In this example 
            we use reduced sizing, of 4 octets. 
           
           
          - the source IPv4 Address, sourceIPv4Address [IPFIX-INFO], 
            with a type of 8 and a length of 4 octets 
           
          - the source Port, sourceTransportPort [IPFIX-INFO], with a 
            type of 7 and a length of 2 octets 
           
         
        The second Option Template contains the following Information 
        Elements:  
      
          -  Scope 2: the commonPropertiesID, with a type of 137 [IPFIX-
            INFO] and a length of 4 octets (reduced sizing). 
           
          - the destination IPv4 Address, destinationIPv4Address 
            [IPFIX-INFO], with a type of 12 and a length of 4 octets 
           
          -  the destination port, destinationTransportPort [IPFIX-INFO] 
            with a type of 11, and a length of 2 octets 
      
        The commonPropertiesId Information Element [NOTE: to be included 
        in IPFIX-INFO], is used in both cases as the Scope Field.

        The Specific Properties Template consists of the information not 
        contained in the Option Templates, i.e. flow specific 
        information. Additionally, this Template contains the two 
        commonPropertiesID. In Data Records, the values of each of these 
        fields will contain one of the unique indices specified in the 
        Option Records exported previously. 
         
        Figure 19 displays the Template including the commonPropertiesID 
        plus the Specific Properties. In this example we export the 
        following Information Elements: 
         
          - commonPropertiesID for the source fields with a length of 4 
            octets (reduced size encoding) 
           
          - commonPropertiesID for the destination fields with a length 
            of 4 octets (reduced size encoding) 
           
          - the number of packets of the Flow: inPacketDeltaCount in 
            [IPFIX-INFO], with a length of 4 octets  
            
          -  the number of octets of the Flow: inOctetDeltaCount in 
            [IPFIX-INFO], with a length of 4 octets

        required for exporting measurement data of this kind are 
        illustrated in the figures below. 
        Figure 21 shows the Option Template containing the information 
        concerning Flows using the commonPropertiesID as scope. In the 
        Common Properties Template we export the following Information 
        Elements: 
         
          - the source IPv4 Address, sourceIPv4Address [IPFIX-INFO], 
            with a type of 8 and a length of 4 octets 
           
          - the destination IPv4 Address, destinationIPv4Address 
            [IPFIX-INFO], with a type of 12 and a length of 4 octets 
           
          - the Class of Service field, ClassOfServiceIPv4 [IPFIX-
            INFO], with a type of 5 and a length of 1 octet 
           
          - the Protocol Identifier, protocolIdentifier [IPFIX-INFO], 
            with a type of 4 and a length of 1 octet

        For passive One-Way-Delay measurement, the Packet Properties 
        Template, or Specific Properties Template, consists of at least 
        Timestamp and Packet ID. Additionally, this template contains a 
        commonPropertiesId field to associate the packet with a Flow.  
         
        Figure 22 displays the template with the packet properties. In 
        this example we export the following Information Elements: 
         
          - commonPropertiesID. In this case reduced size encoding is 
            used, and the Information Element is declared with a length 
            of 4 octets instead of 8. 
         
          - packetTimestamp, packetID, and packetLength. Since 
            packetTimestamp, packetID, and packetLength are not (yet) 
            IETF-defined information elements, we export them as 
            enterprise-specific IEs. The three IEs have respectively a 
            type of 220, 221, and 222 and a length of 8, 4, and 4 
            octets.

        Figure 22: Example Packet Properties Template  
         
         
        At the collection point, packet records from the two measurement 
        points are gathered and correlated by means of the packet ID. 
        The resulting delay data records are exported in a similar 
        manner as the packet data. One-way delay data is associated with 
        flow information by the commonPropertiesId field. The OWD 
        properties contain the Packet Pair ID (which is the packet ID of 
        the two contributing packet records), the timestamp of the 
        packet passing the reference monitor point in order to 
        reconstruct a time series, the calculated delay value, and the 
        commonPropertiesID. 
         
        In this example using IPFIX to export the measurement data for 
        each received packet 30 bytes have to be transferred 
        (sourceAddressV4=4, destinationAddressV4=4, classOfServiceV4=1, 
        protocolIdentifier=1, sourceTransportPort=2, 
        destionationTransportPort=2, packetTimestamp=8, packetID=4, 
        packetLength=4). Without considering the IPFIX protocol overhead 
        a flow of 1000 packets produces 30000 bytes of measurement data. 
        Using the proposed optimization each packet produces an export 
        of only 20 bytes (packetTimestamp=8, packetID=4, packetLength=4, 
        commonPropertiesID=4). The export of the flow information 
        produces 18 bytes (sourceAddressV4=4, destinationAddressV4=4, 
        classOfServiceV4=1, protocolIdentifier=1, sourceTransportPort=2, 
        destionationTransportPort=2, commonPropertiesID =4). For a flow 
        of 1000 packets this sums up to 20018 bytes. This is a decrease 
        of more than 33 percent.
