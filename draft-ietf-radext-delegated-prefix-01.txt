   or Diameter.

Internet-Draft       Delegated-IPv6-Prefix Attribute            May 2006


1.  Introduction

   The Delegated-IPv6-Prefix is a RADIUS attribute [1] that carries an
   IPv6 prefix to be delegated to the user.  For example, the prefix in
   a Delegated-IPv6-Prefix attribute can be delegated to another node
   through DHCP Prefix Delegation [2].


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].


3.  Attribute format

   The format of the Delegated-IPv6-Prefix is:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     Type      |    Length     |  Reserved     | Prefix-Length |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                   Prefix
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                   Prefix
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                   Prefix
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                   Prefix                             |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


       Type

            TBD for Delegated-IPv6-Prefix

       Length

            At least 4 and no larger than 20

       Reserved

            Always set to zero

Internet-Draft       Delegated-IPv6-Prefix Attribute            May 2006


       Prefix-Length

            The length of the prefix, in bits.  At least 0 and no larger
            than 128

   Note that the prefix field is only required to be long enough to hold
   the prefix bits and can be shorter than 16 bytes.  Any bits in the
   prefix field that are not part of the prefix MUST be zero.

   The definition of the Delegated-IPv6-Prefix Attribute is based on the
   Framed-IPv6-Prefix attribute.

   The Delegated-IPv6-Prefix MAY appear in an Access-Accept packet, and
   can appear multiple times.  It MAY appear in an Access-Request packet
   as a hint by the NAS to the server that it would prefer these
   prefix(es), but the server is not required to honor the hint.

   The Delegated-IPv6-Prefix attribute MAY appear in an Accounting-
   Request packet.

   The Delegated-IPv6-Prefix MUST NOT appear in any other RADIUS
   packets.

   The following table describes which messages the Delegated-IPv6-
   Prefix attribute can appear in and in what quantity.

   Request Accept Accounting  #   Attribute
                  Request
   0+      0+     0+          TBD Delegated-IPv6-Prefix

   In this table 0+ means that zero or more instances of this attribute
   MAY be present in packet.  This attribute MUST NOT appear in any
   packet not listed in the table.


4.  Diameter Considerations

   A definition is needed for an identical attribute with the same Type
   value for Diameter [4].  The attribute should be available as part of
   the NASREQ application [5], as well as the Diameter EAP application
   [6].


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a Type value, TBD, for this attribute
   from the RADIUS Types registry.

6.  Security Considerations

   Known security vulnerabilities of the RADIUS protocol are discussed
   in RFC 2607 [7], RFC 2865 [1] and RFC 2869 [8].  Use of IPsec [9] for
   providing security when RADIUS is carried in IPv6 is discussed in RFC
   3162 [10].


7.  Change Log

   The following changes were made in revision -01 of this document:
   o  Added additional details to Abstract; defined that this attribute
      can be used in both RADIUS and Diameter.  (Issue 188)
   o  Moved and clarified text describing which packets this attribute
      can appear in adjacent to table in section 3.  (Issue 188)
   o  Fixed RFC 2119 boilerplate in section 2.  (Issue 185)
   o  Fixed table in section 3 to clarify which packets this attribute
      cannot appear in.  (Issue 188)
   o  Added section 4, Diameter Considerations.  (Issue 188)
   o  Made some references in section 6, Security Considerations,
      Informative rather than Normative.  (Issue 188)
   o  Updated reference to RFC 2401 [9] to RFC 4301.  (Issue 188)
   o  Changed "IP SEC" to "IPsec" in section 6.  (Issues 185 and 188)
