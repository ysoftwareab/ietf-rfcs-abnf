3.0 The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


4.0 IANA Considerations

   This memo does NOT define any new name spaces which must be 
   maintained by IANA.  This memo DOES consume an IfType assignment 
   that has been made by IANA:

       infiniband(ianaIfType 199)   -- Assigned by IANA  

   as well as an experimental MIB registration space:

       infinibandMIB ::= { experimental 117 }   -- Assigned by IANA

   The infinibandMIB name space will be locally administered by 
   the IPOIB Working group as new MIBS are created by the group.


5.0 Introduction to InfiniBand
 
   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing InfiniBand interfaces.
   The managed objects provide extensions to the objects defined in
   the Interface Group MIB [RFC2863]. This memo provides managed
   objects based on Sections 14 - 16 of the InfiniBand Architecture
   specification [Infini v1.1]  The intent of this memo is to define
   value added manageability of IBA devices by defining SNMP managed
   objects and at the same time avoid making SNMP management a
   requirement for device operation.
 
   IBA, unlike most physical layer network protocols, specifies a 
   non-SNMP external management protocol that controls a wide range of
   functions necessary for IBA devices to operate.  The functions 
   performed by the InfiniBand managers and agents, including the IBA
   Subnet Manager(SM) and Subnet Management Agents(SMA) in the managed
   devices include, but are not limited to, device configuration, fault 
   detection, performance monitoring, and device configuration 
   persistence.

Internet-Draft                 IPOVERIB IF MIB                 June 2003

   Even given this native management capability, SNMP manageability of
   any networking components in today's networks is highly desirable
   or even a requirement especially in the area of fault and performance
   management. Obviously, having two management paradigms simultaneously
   controlling a device or portions there of would require a high 
   degree of cooperation between paradigms to avoid conflicts.
   Therefore, to give maximum visibility but avoid these conflicts, the
   managed objects defined in this memo offer read-only access to the
   attributes defined by InfiniBand native management wherever a
   conflict with IBA defined management exists. 
 
   The counters defined in this memo are based on IBA defined counters.
   But in order to support the semantic behavior defined by SNMP SMI
   [RFC2578] conversions are required in several aspects of numerous 
   InfiniBand specified counters.  These changes deal primarily with
   counter width differences, latch-on-wrap (aka "saturate at all 1's"),
   clear-on-read (reset to zero), and writeability of the InfiniBand 
   Architecture native counters as defined in [Infini v1.1].
   Mechanisms for doing the required conversion are not defined by 
   this memo.

   Instances of the managed object types defined herein represent
   attributes of a port on an InfiniBand communications medium
   device (IBA specification prefers the term "port" to "interface").
   IBA defined ports can be paralleled/striped over multiple
   physical links called "physical lanes" . Aggregations of 
   1x, 4x, and 12x physical lanes are defined by the IBA.
   The IBA treats these aggregations as one port. The objects 
   defined herein do the same.  Thus no exposure to per physical 
   lane information is defined. 

   At present, InfiniBand media are identified by the following values 
   of the ifType object in the Interfaces Group MIB [RFC2863]:

            infiniband(ianaIfType 199)  -- Assigned by IANA


5.1  Relation to MIB-2
 
   This section applies only when this MIB is used in conjunction with
   the "old" (RFC 1213) interface group.
 
   The relationship between an InfiniBand interface and an interface
   in the context of MIB-2 is one-to-one.  As such, the value of an
   ifIndex object instance can be directly used to identify
   corresponding instances of the objects defined herein.
 
   For agents which implement the (now deprecated) ifSpecific object, an
   instance of that object that is associated with an InfiniBand
   interface has the OBJECT IDENTIFIER value:
 
       infiniband OBJECT IDENTIFER
       ::= { transmission ianaIfType-TBD } --To be assigned by IANA

5.2  Relation to the Interfaces MIB
 
   The Interfaces MIB [RFC2863] requires that any MIB which is an 
   adjunct of the Interface MIB clarify specific areas within the 
   Interfaces MIB. These areas were intentionally left vague in the
   Interfaces MIB to avoid over constraining the MIB, thereby precluding
   management of certain media-types.
 
   Section 4.0 of [RFC2863] enumerates several areas that a
   media-specific MIB must clarify.  Each of these areas is addressed
   in a following subsection.  The implementor is referred to [RFC2863] 
   in order to understand the general intent of these areas.


5.2.1.  Layering Model
 
   This MIB does not provide for layering.  There are no sublayers
   defined by this memo.  Higher Layer protocol stacking on the
   interfaces is not defined by this memo.

   
5.2.2.  Virtual Circuits
 
   This medium does not support virtual circuits and this area is not
   applicable to this MIB. 

                                                                        
5.2.3.  ifTestTable
 
   There are no media tests which are instrumented with this MIB.


5.2.4.  ifRcvAddressTable 

   For IBA Routers and Channel Adapters (CAs): 
   Routers and CAs which have been programmed by the IBA Subnet Manager
   to have more than one address, use this table to display the set of 
   additional addresses beyond the "base" Local Identifier (LID) for 
   which the interface will receive packets. If desired to avoid 
   conflicts with the IBA Subnet Manager configuration of this table, 
   this table MAY be implemented as read-only. See 5.2.5 for encoding 
   of the Physical Address (ifPhysAddress).

   For IBA Switches:
   Additionally for switches, since the ifRcvAddressTable table is 
   explicitly not intended to provide a bridge address filtering
   mechanism, there is no need to expose the multicast and unicast 
   forwarding table addresses here.
    

5.2.5.  ifPhysAddress
 
   This object contains the 16 bit "base" Local Identifier (LID) 
   currently in effect on this port. Whether the address was assigned

   by the IBA Subnet Manager or through some other mechanism does not
   matter.  In the event that no LID is currently in affect an 
   Octet String of zero length is returned.  For switches the "base"
   LID of the (conceptual) management port (port 0) shall be used.
 
   The address is stored in binary in this object.  The address is
   stored in IBA defined bit order, that is, the high-order bit of
   the Local Identifier byte 0 is positioned as the high-order bit of
   the first byte of the ifPhysAddress.


5.2.6.  ifType
 
   This MIB applies to interfaces which have any of the following 
   ifType values:

            infiniband(ianaIfType 199)   -- Assigned by IANA 

   Information regarding the number of physical lanes that comprise the
   port may be included in the ifDescr object (i.e., 1x, 4x, or 12x).
    

5.2.7.  Specific Interface MIB Objects
 
   The following table provides specific implementation guidelines for
   applying the interface group objects to InfiniBand media.
 
      Object                     Guidelines

      ifIndex                    Each InfiniBand interface is
                                 represented by an ifEntry. 
 

      ifDescr                    Refer to [RFC2863]. 
 
      ifType                     Refer to section 5.2.6.

      ifMtu                      The size of the largest packet 
                                 that is capable of being either
                                 sent/received over this interface
                                 specified in octets.  Actual MTU in use
                                 is determined by examining
                                 device MTU capability or NeighborMTU
                                 value (if valid) in the portInfo table.

      ifSpeed                    The current effective operational speed
                                 of the interface in bits per second. 
                                 The speed reported compensates for the 
                                 8B10B encoding used on the links. 
                                 For current InfiniBand interfaces, this
                                 will be equal to 2,000,000,000
                                 (2 billion), 8,000,000,000 
                                 (8 billion), or 24,000,000,000

                                 ports, respectively.  Since both the
                                 4x and 12x values are greater than the 
                                 maximum reportable by this object,
                                 this object should report its maximum 
                                 value (4,294,967,295) and ifHighSpeed
                                 must be used to report the interface's
                                 speed.  Actual Speed in use is
                                 determined by examining device
                                 linkWidthSuported  or linkWidthActive

                                 should be "up" to avoid requiring the
                                 use of a SNMP manager to enable the
                                 interface.  Support for "testing" 
                                 is not required. Providing
                                 read-write access to this object
                                 can potentially cause conflicts with
                                 the IBA Subnet Manager which also 
                                 controls Port State through the SMA.

5.3  Structure of the MIB
 
   This MIB is structured as three groups: 

   o   Detail error statistics on a per interface basis (ibIfPortStats).
       This table provides visibility into error counters defined by
       the IBA.

   o   Detail traffic statistics on a per interface and virtual lane 
       pair basis (ibIfVLTraffic).  This table provides visibility into 
       data flow counters kept on a per VL basis defined by the IBA.

   o   Information that associates the IP over IB link layer addresses
       with Infiniband interfaces (ports).


5.4  Mapping of IBA managed attribute fields

   This section lists the correlation and conversion between the SNMP
   managed objects defined by this memo and the IBA defined attributes 
   they are based on.  Note, that the relationship expressed below does

   not address issues relating to counter widths, latching and 
   reset ability differences between the SNMP SMI and IBA object
   definitions.  Note, that since multicast counters have not been
   defined by the IBA specification, IF-MIB multicast counters should
   be set to 0 (in the absence of any proprietary IBA multicast 
   counters).  Also, based on the IBA counter definitions, multicast 
   (packets and bytes) will be part of the IF-MIB unicast counters.

   The following table is organized by the IBA Attributes that fields
   belong in. In the case where fields from multiple attributes are 
   required, the supplemental attributes are then fully qualified 
   in the formula below.  A second section covering Port Sample 
   counters is also included.

   Some Abbreviations used:

   POH =  Packet Overhead = 4 =  1 START + 1 END  + 2 VCRC Octets;
   SLP = Size Link flow control Packet = 8 = 1 START + 1 END +
         6 flow control octets;
   MHB = Max Header Bytes = 126 octets; includes all packet fields
         except framing characters. See [Infini v1.1] sec 7.7.8.

    The following "Case Diagram" visually depicts the mapping described
    in section 5.4.  Again it should be noted that since no multicast 
    counters are defined by the IBA specification they are not covered 
    here.

7.0 Revision History

   This section is to be removed when this document is published as an
   RFC.


7.1 Changes from <draft-ietf-ipoib-ibif-mib-00.txt>

   The InfiniBand Textual Conventions MIB module was removed from
   this document and became a separate Internet Draft (draft-ietf-
   ipoib-ibmib-tc-mib-00.txt). That MIB defines the infinibandMIB as
   object identifier { experimental 117 }. The TC MIB is defined as
   { infinibandMIB 1 } and the IB Interface MIB will become 
   { infinibandMIB 2 }. The ibIfMIB MODULE-IDENTITY was updated.

   The infiniband IANA ifType definition of 199 was added.

   Sean Harnedy from InfiniSwitch as added as an author, and updated
   Section 8.0 Authors' Addresses.

   Added Section 4.0 Revision History.

   Removed former Section 7.1 Known Issues and added REFERENCE clauses
   to objects and added Basic and Full Compliance modules to 
   differentiate between mandatory and optional InfiniBand counters.

   Other minor DESCRIPTION edits, etc. as needed.


7.2 Changes from <draft-ietf-ipoib-ibif-mib-01.txt>

   Added the IPOIB Link Layer Address table. Updated IMPORTS section.


7.3 Changes from <draft-ietf-ipoib-ibif-mib-02.txt>

   The SYNTAX of ibIpoibLinkLayerAddrEntry was corrected. Minor edits.

7.4 Changes from <draft-ietf-ipoib-ibif-mib-03.txt>

   Updated REFERENCE notation to new IBTA Spec version 1.1; Minor edits.
   Updated DESCRIPTIONs to match new spec.


7.5 Changes from <draft-ietf-ipoib-ibif-mib-04.txt>

   Updated Authors' information. Updated MIB boilerplate section and 
   made adjustments to adhere to guidelines for Internet Draft writers
   and MIB authors. Other minor edits.


8.0 Security Considerations

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-
   based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
