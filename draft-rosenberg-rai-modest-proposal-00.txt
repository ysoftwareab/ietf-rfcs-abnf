Abstract

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has become widely deployed on
   the Internet, covering a wide range of usages from toll bypass to
   instant messaging, from service provider to enterprise.  However, its
   realization in actual deployments differs in important ways from the
   specifications.  This has created a gulf between existing and ongoing
   standards work, and real live deployments.  This document argues that
   the RAI area should focus on solving real world interoperability
   issues and address real world functional gaps.

Internet-Draft               Modest Proposal                October 2008


1.  Introduction

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261], is a wildly
   successful protocol by any metric.  It has seen widespread deployment
   on the Internet.  It is used primarily in Voice over IP deployments,
   and carries billions and billions of minutes of traffic each year.
   It is used by enterprises big and small, by services providers far
   and wide, for a wide range of communications applications.

   However, like any large piece of work, some of the SIP specifications
   have seen widespread usage, and others have not.  Indeed, in the past
   few years, there has been an increase in the gap between
   implementations and standards, with an increasing number of
   specifications being produced with limited use in the industry.  At
   the same time, the industry is facing a whole host of
   interoperability and SIP problems, which are not being addressed by
   IETF.

   This document proposes that the SIP working group (and the RAI area
   at large), recognize this gap, and begin work on addressing the real
   needs of real SIP deployments.


2.  The SIP Implementation Gap

   The SIP implementation gap is the increasing difference between SIP
   as defined by the IETF, across its many specifications, and SIP in
   use within the industry.  This gap manifests itself in several key
   ways - specifications that are not implemented or used by most
   vendors or networks, non-standard solutions to problems, and networks
   whose architectures differ from the models conceived by the IETF
   specifications.  The latter gap appears to be one of the primary
   contributors to the implementation gap.  This architecture gap
   consists of three primary areas:

   Proxies vs. B2BUA:  The SIP specifications would lead a reader to
      believe that SIP networks are full of these things called proxies,
      and that these proxies are principally concerned about call
      routing and are totally ignorant of call state.  In reality, many
      if not most of the intermediaries in vendor products and networks
      are B2BUAs.  These include SBCs, IP PBXs, softswitches, and so on,
      all of which are B2BUA.

   Endpoint vs. Network Features:  The SIP architecture envisions a
      model where the majority of features live in the endpoints, and a
      smaller number live in the network.  Network features are
      primarily limited to routing features - such as call forwarding
      and follow-me - which live in proxies.  Though this is true for



Rosenberg                Expires April 29, 2009                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft               Modest Proposal                October 2008


      some networks (it is a foundational principle in P2P networks),
      most operational SIP deployments do not work this way.  In
      reality, many products implement a much larger set of features in
      the network.  Indeed, there appears to be a wide variation in this
      area, from one extreme (for P2P, all features in the endpoints) to
      another (using SIP as an MGCP alternative, passing digits and
      stimulus over INFO or DTMF to a call agent which implements all
      features).  Unsurprisingly, this variation is a consequence of the
      software architecture of many products that existed prior to
      adding SIP, and in a desire not to re-architect products, features
      remain where they were and SIP gets added on.

   Email vs. Number Identifiers:  The SIP specifications support both
      email-style and phone number identifiers.  However, the focus - in
      examples, in specifications, and in use cases - is for email-style
      addressing.  However, many deployments still utilize traditional
      phone numbers, and represent them using a SIP URI whose domain
      part is ignored, irrelevant, or used merely for determining the
      next hop target for the request.

   Open Federation:  The SIP specifications assume an email-style open-
      Internet interconnection - a user in example.com can send an
      INVITE to a user in a completely different domain - example.edu,
      and using basic DNS lookups, the call can be completed between
      domains without prior arrangement.  While this remains a laudable
      goal, in practice it has not happened.  SIP is deployed widely
      within individual domains, but interconnections between domains,
      when they do exist, are through managed federations.


3.  Implications of the Gap

   There are several consequences of this gap that are important for
   IETF.

3.1.  Low Adoption Rate of Specifications

   Because of the implementation gap, IETF has produced many
   specifications which target problems in networks or deployments which
   represent only a small minority of real systems.  As a consequence,
   these specifications have seen poor adoption and support.  The cost
   to IETF is one of opportunity; time we could have spent on problems
   important to a large number of deployments, are spent on problems
   important to only a few.

   Interestingly, many of these relate to B2BUAs.  The following
   specifications, all of which have seen relatively limited adoption,
   are all important only in networks with proxies and not B2BUAs:



Rosenberg                Expires April 29, 2009                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               Modest Proposal                October 2008


   GRUU:  In networks with proxies, the proxy cannot modify the Contact
      header field in dialog forming requests and responses.  This
      necessitates the mechanism in GRUU [I-D.ietf-sip-gruu] whereby a
      UA can obtain and utilize URIs for use in the Contact header
      field.  However, since a B2BUA does maintain call state, it can
      merely rewrite the Contact header field to one that has the GRUU
      property.  That can be done without specification, and is indeed a
      common practice in B2BUA.  Results from SIPIt 23 indicate that
      GRUU was supported by only 9% of implementations present, despite
      thet fact that it has been done for many years.

   Session Policies:  In networks with proxies, the proxy cannot modify
      the SDP to enforce network policies on things like codecs or media
      intermediaries.  This necessitates a mechanism, via the session
      policy framework [I-D.ietf-sip-session-policy-framework] and
      related specifications [I-D.ietf-sipping-media-policy-dataset],
      [I-D.ietf-sipping-policy-package], that allow a proxy and UA to
      communicate policies to each other.  However, in a network with
      B2BUA, the B2BUAs can just modify the SDP and other parts of the
      signaling to enforce policy.  This requires no specification and
      is commonly done.  There were no implementations of session policy
      at SIPit 23.

   SIP Identity:  SIP identity [RFC4474] assumes an interconnection of
      proxies which do not rewrite key fields in the SIP message (which
      are covered by signatures) and which make user of email-style
      identifiers.  Consequently, although the problem space it
      addresses is highly relevant to deployments with B2BUA and proxies
      alike, the mechanism itself is not compatible with B2BUAs or phone
      numbers, both of which are common.  Only two implementations at
      SIPit 23 (out of 50 present) had RFC 4474 support.

3.2.  Unaddressed Problems

   SIP has seen widespread deployment, and as a consequence, many
   interoperability issues have arisen in actual networks.  Many of
   these are areas where additional standards work could help improve
   the situation.  In addition, there remain areas where there are no
   standards, and useful work could be done, but is not being done
   because the problems don't make sense in the original SIP
   architecture.

   Several meetings ago, the SIP forum hosted an interoperability
   session during a lunch break.  The session included presentations
   from many vendors and network operators listing real issues that they
   were having.  These included problems with DTMF interoperability,
   phone number representation, SDP incompatibilities, and so on.  Yet,
   IETF has not responded with work to address these issues.  In some

Internet-Draft               Modest Proposal                October 2008


   cases, the problem is that the IETF standards-based solutions for
   these problems have not been adopted by the industry.  Sometimes, its
   jut a matter of time.  In other cases, the proposed solutions, while
   architecturally pure and elegant, have simply been too complicated
   for the use cases for which they were targeted.  For example, despite
   the IETF's production of a standard for signaling-based carriage of
   DTMF (KPML, RFC 4730 [RFC4730]), it has seen relatively little
   adoption.  Rather, most deployments use an INFO-based solution that
   is not standards based, but has been found to be much simpler for
   actual implementors.  Only at the most recent IETF was there
   agreement to adopt a framework for INFO.

3.3.  Declining Participation

   Some RAI gourps have seen a decline in participation from folks with
   real implementations who have real problems to solve.  More and more,
   folks seem to be busy with day jobs with little time for IETF.  This
   has resulted in increasing timelines to complete drafts as editors
   struggle to get a revision done per meeting.  While there is
   certainly no consensus that this is the only or even primary part of
   the problem, I do believe lack of participation and slow editors is a
   part of it.

   Why is that?  Why are folks more busy with day jobs with less time
   for IETF?  Perhaps its due to the fact that the IETF simply isn't
   producing documents that are actually relevant to their day jobs -
   said day jobs presumably being tied to real products with real
   implementations and real deployments.  If, however, IETF work were
   tied to the actual implementation issues those product teams were
   facing, we might see an increase in participation from implementors.


4.  A Modest Proposal

   Unsurprisingly, my modest proposal is the following is to do three
   primary things:

   1.  Recognize the realities of SIP operational networks and take them
       into account.

   2.  Weigh our efforts proportionally with the number of affected
       networks.

   3.  Less is More.

Internet-Draft               Modest Proposal                October 2008


4.1.  Recognize the Realities

   The RAI area needs to formally recognize that B2BUAs, phone numbers,
   and intra-domain focused implementations are common, and are part of
   SIP's architecture.  As an example, DHCP is an intra-domain only
   protocol, yet it was specified by IETF and is absolutely a standards
   track.

   Consequently, we should formally design our specifications to work in
   those environments when appropriate, and perhaps even be optimized
   for them based on engineering analysis.  If a particular feature
   needs to work one way in a proxy environment, and a different but
   much simpler way in a B2BUA environment, the IETF should consider
   that perhaps the much simpler solution, which is likely to be broadly
   applicable, is superior.  Session policies is a great example of
   that; with an SBC, the solution of modifying SDP is much simpler than
   defining a protocol framework for negotiation between UA and servers
   in the network.  IETF is, after all, the Internet *Engineering* Task
   Force, and engineering involves minimizing resources for maximal
   match of requirements.

   Of course, nothing is absolute and all things are subject to
   engineering analysis; but we should stop ruling out solutions that
   require B2BUA, and consider them fully in our efforts.  Furthemore,
   SIP is nothing if not diverse.  Some features are targeted at
   networks, like P2PSIP, which lack central servers by design.  As part
   of our engineering analysis, we need to factor in whether a feature
   is relevant in such networks, and whether their properties impact the
   engineering choice on the mechanism.

   To support this end, I propose the following specific steps:

   1.  The RAI area produce an informative document which shows pictures
       of several exemplary real operational SIP networks, covering
       service providers, enterprises, consumer and residential
       services, presence/IM networks, and so on.  Such pictures would
       omit vendor names but be clear about what kinds of components are
       in the network (B2BUA, gateways, proxies, UAs of various sorts),
       what the scale is, and what types of protocols are in use.  That
       will provide a clear framework to measure how easily our
       specifications 'fit' into the real networks that are out there
       today.  We can update that document regularly as real networks
       change.  We should invite architects of such networks or vendors
       of key components in those networks to help draft the document.

   2.  The RAI area update the guidelines for authors of SIP extensions
       [RFC4485] to reference the above informative document, and based
       on it, present additional guidelines - e.g., take into account



Rosenberg                Expires April 29, 2009                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft               Modest Proposal                October 2008


       SBCs, and so on.

   3.  The RAI area revise RFC 3427 [RFC3427] (the SIP change process).
       Work was begun on this [I-D.peterson-rai-rfc3427bis], but the
       draft is now expired.  That revision should remove the "P-header"
       punishment for specifications which do not work on the public
       Internet.  IETF should recognize that intra-domain and multi-
       domain but closed federations are real, and valid deployments of
       SIP.  Standards defined to address problems in those deployments
       are no less 'real' than ones meant for SIP on the Internet.

4.2.  Effort Proportional to Deployments

   SIP, like all other technologies, has gone through an adoption
   lifecycle.  This lifecycle, called the technology adoption life
   cycle, looks at the rate of adoption of new technologies over time.
   Within the VoIP market, SIP is currently in the late majority phase;
   most vendors have it, it is widely deployed and operational.

   It is well understood in product marketing that your strategies for
   building and selling products vary tremendously as a technology
   crosses through these phases.  During the innovation and early
   adopter phases, the technology can be rough, hard to manage and use.
   But, the focus is on new capabilities and benefits to the user.  As
   technologies mature, the importance of 'new' diminishes, and instead,
   ease of use, ease of purchase, and reduction in operational cost,
   become more and more important.

   I would assert that, the same applies to standardization processes.
   In the beginning, when a technology is new, the right thing is to
   focus on cool new capabilities, innovations, and wild new
   capabilities.  As a technology matures, the standards activities need
   to shift focus as well, moving more towards real problems in real
   networks.  The golden rule is:

Internet-Draft               Modest Proposal                October 2008


      The work IETF spends on a topic should be proportional to the
      number of operational networks in which that topic is important.

   The SIP working group and RAI area at large invest their energies in
   problems proportionally to the scope of the networks and deployments
   with those problems.  A problem, like SDP interoperability, which
   affects a large number of real operational networks, should be given
   priority over one with a limited audience.  It is important to note
   that audience refers NOT to implementations, and NOT to other SDOs,
   but to current or planned networks.  Oftentimes, folks have an
   implementation but it is a prototype or research activity.  Those
   implementations should count less in our prioritization than ones in
   actual large-scale operational networks.  Similarly, oftentimes a
   specification is needed by another SDO, for their own standards.
   While the SDO and its specifications are important, we should weight
   such work by looking at the current or planned real implementations
   of our specification that come about through that SDO.

   How do we make this determination of what is important?  One
   suggestion is that the SIP and/or SIPPING groups review the
   contributions to the SIP forum session a few IETFs back, and begin
   working the top issues identified there.  The inclination is often to
   say, "oh, thats just an implementation problem", or, "well they were
   just being lazy".  However, for problems that are systemic - where
   several vendors would appear to be lazy or getting it wrong, this
   points to an issue - either the specifications are overly complex and
   the industry has decided not to use them, or they are unclear and
   hard to get correct.  Both of these are problems that can be
   addressed by additional standards work.  So the suggestion is to lean
   towards, "its the IETF's fault" when doing this analysis.

   Another suggestion is that the SIP and/or SIPPING working groups
   approach vendors with SIP implementations and deployments and solicit
   requests for areas of standards work that they would like to see
   addressed.  Those folks should also be invited to participate in the
   IETF with welcome arms.  We can set up mentoring programs were
   existing long-time participants help new folks learn the ropes and
   show them how to participate on the lists and bring ideas forward.
   Collection of input on standards work could happen via a web survey,
   for example, much like was done for the BLISS working group.

   Indeed, since IETF is ultimately a volunteer organization, any
   proposal that requires a change in focus, requires bringing in
   participants who are interested in that focus.  We should therefore
   try and identify steps which lead to increased participation from
   implementors and deployers.

4.3.  Less is More

   IETF overall, and RAI in particular, has a tendency to produce
   specifications which are fairly large and complex (indeed I
   personally have contributed much to this).  The focus has been to
   have broad solutions that provide general purpose, framework-type
   capabilities.  As SIP has matured and become deployed, it is now part
   of many products and networks for which big large changes are hard.
   Consequently, it is becoming increasingly important to aim low, and
   produce specifications that provide incremental features for only a
   small increment of work.  This is not always possible of course, but
   our focus should be, "less is more", especially when weighing the
   features of the specification relative to the current reality of
   networks.

   One such example of this is the configuration framework
   [I-D.ietf-sipping-config-framework].  It is a very rich and complex
   specification, supporting composition of configuration policies,
   roaming and home networks, change notifications and enrollment.  In
   reality, many consumer products just periodically poll a config file
   from a defined URL, and thats it.  A much simpler configuration
   mechanism, that is easy to add ontop of what is out there today,
   would probably be more welcome in the marketplace.  Note that, at
   SIPit 23, there were no implementations of the configuration
   framework.

   Another example of this is the relatively new SDP capability
   negotiation framework [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-capability-negotiation].
   This work was driven primarily to solve one key industry problem -
   negotiating SRTP vs. RTP.  So, the decision factor is, should we
   define a general purpose framework or an incremental solution just
   for RTP/SRTP?  The IETF chose a general purpose framework, and that
   brings with it a certain level of complexity.  Will implementors use
   this just to solve that one problem?  I am concerned the cost/benefit
   ratio is too high.


5.  Conclusion

   In conclusion, IETF needs to adapt to the realities of SIP.  The IETF
   should focus on reall engineering problems that enable building
   interoperability systems that will see significant deployment.  The
   RAI area needs to admit the things like SBCs and phone numbers and
   private federations are real, and design solutions for them.  Those
   networks are our customers.
