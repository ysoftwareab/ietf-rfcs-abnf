Abstract

   When experimenting with or extending protocols, it is often necessary
   to use some sort of protocol number or constant in order to actually
   test or experiment with the new function, even when testing in a
   closed environment.  This document reserves some ranges of numbers
   for experimentation purposes in specific protocols where the need to
   support experimentation has been identified, and describes the
   numbers that have already been reserved by other documents.

Internet-Draft                3692 for 2780                    June 2005


   This is a strawman to see what the community thinks of allocating
   experimental numbers as [RFC3692] proposes to other IANA-maintained
   number spaces.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC3692] recommends assigning option numbers for experiments and
   testing.  This document requests [[anchor2: documents --(when
   assigned)]] such assignments for the number spaces whose IANA
   considerations are documented in [RFC2780].  This document generally
   follows the form of [RFC2780].

   When using these values, please carefully consider the advice in
   Sections 1 and 1.1 of [RFC3692].

2.  Fields in the IPv4 header

   The IPv4 header [RFC0791] contains the following fields that carry
   values assigned by the IANA: Version, Type of Service, Protocol,
   Source Address, Destination Address, and Option Type.

2.1  IPv4 IP Version field

   The IPv4 Version field is always 4.

2.2  IPv4 Type of Service field

   [RFC2474] defines Pool 2 as Experimental / Local Use, so no
   additional code points should be needed.  The ECN field [RFC3168] has
   no free code points to assign.

2.3  IPv4 Protocol field

   [RFC3692] allocates two experimental code points (253 and 254) for
   the IPv4 Protocol field.

2.4  IPv4 Source and Destination addresses

2.4.1  IPv4 Unicast

   No experimental IPv4 addresses are defined.  For certain experiments,
   the address ranges set aside for Private Internets in [RFC1918] may
   be useful.

2.4.2  IPv4 Multicast

   The globally routable group 224.0.1.20 is set aside for
   experimentation.  For certain experiments, the administratively

Internet-Draft                3692 for 2780                    June 2005


   scoped multicast groups defined in [RFC2365] may be
   useful.[[anchor10: Should there be a 'link-local' 224.0.0.x
   experiment group? --wcf]]

2.5  IPv4 Option Type field

   No experimental IPv4 options are defined. [[anchor12: should there
   be? --wcf]]

3.  Fields in the IPv6 header

   The IPv6 header [RFC2460] contains the following fields that carry
   values assigned from IANA-managed name spaces: Version, Traffic
   Class, Next Header, Source and Destination Address.  In addition, the
   IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Options and Destination Options extension headers
   include an Option Type field with values assigned from an IANA-
   managed name space.

3.1  IPv6 Version field

   The IPv6 Version field is always 6.

3.2  IPv6 Traffic Class field

   [RFC2474] defines Pool 2 as Experimental / Local Use, so no
   additional code points should be needed.  The ECN field [RFC3168] has
   no free code points to assign.

3.3  IPv6 Next Header field

   [RFC3692] allocates two experimental code points (253 and 254) for
   the IPv6 Next Header field.

3.4  IPv6 Source and Destination Addresses

3.4.1  IPv6 Unicast Addresses

   No experimental IPv6 addresses are defined.  For certain experiments,
   Unique Local Addresses [I-D.ietf-ipv6-unique-local-addr] may be
   useful.

3.4.2  IPv6 Multicast Addresses

   The group FF0X::114 is set aside for experimentation at all scope
   levels.  Smaller scopes may be particularly useful for
   experimentation, since they are defined not to leak out of a given
   defined boundary which can be set to be the boundary of the
   experiment.

3.5  IPv6 Destination Option Fields

   This document assigns a single option type, with all possible values
   of the "act" and "chg" fields, resulting in eight distinct option
   type codes.[[anchor21: Call it a hop by hop option too, or require
   Router Alert as an HBH option to then call the router's attention to
   the packet?]]

3.6  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Fields

   The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery header [RFC2461] contains the following
   fields that carry values assigned from IANA- managed name spaces:
   Type, Code and Option Type.

4.  Fields in the IPv4 ICMP header

   TBD

5.  Fields in the IPv6 ICMP header

   [I-D.ietf-ipngwg-icmp-v3] includes experimental code points for
   Informational and Error message types.

6.  Fields in the UDP header

   [[anchor26: Reserve a system port or two for UDP+TCP? --wcf]]

7.  Fields in the TCP header


7.1  TCP Source and Destination Port fields

   [[anchor29: Reserve a system port or two for UDP+TCP? --wcf]]

7.2  Reserved Bits in TCP Header

   There are not enough reserved bits to allocate any for
   experimentation.

7.3  TCP Option Kind field

   TBD

8.  IANA Considerations

   The new assignments are summarized below.

9.  Security Considerations

   Security analyzers such as firewalls and network intrusion detection
   monitors often rely on unambiguous interpretations of the fields
   described in this memo.  As new values for the fields are assigned,
   existing security analyzers that do not understand the new values may
   fail, resulting in either loss of connectivity if the analyzer
   declines to forward the unrecognized traffic, or loss of security if
   it does forward the traffic and the new values are used as part of an
   attack.  Assigning known values for experiments can allow such
   analyzers to take a known action for explicitly experimental traffic.
