Abstract

   As a mobile node moves in a network, existing mobility mechanisms
   may not be sufficient to achieve performance as expected by the
   user. Seamless mobility can be said to be achieved when a mobile
   node suffers little to no disruption of service.  This document
   presents an overview of requirements and functions needed for
   Seamless Mobility and their impact.

1 Introduction

   In a general sense, seamless mobility can be considered from the
   end-user's perspective: on-going sessions and services should not
   suffer due to the mobility of the end-terminal.

   This document outlines some requirements and techniques for
   achieving seamless mobility.

1.1  Basic Handover Model

   The following figure presents a basic IP handover.

              I            +------------+
            +-+            |  Previous  |        <
            | | ---------- |   Router   | ------ > ----\
            +-+            |   (Prtr)   |        <      \

             |             +------------+            +---------------+

             |                   |         Network   |  Node         |
             V                   |                   +---------------+
                                 v                        /
              I            +------------+                /
            +-+            |    New     |        <      /
            | | ---------- |   Router   | ------ > ----/
            +-+            |   (Nrtr)   |        <

1.2 Terminology

   Mobile Node (MN) - A user terminal with an IP client. Also called
   the Mobile Terminal or Mobile Station.

   Access Node - Node which the mobile node attaches to (on the IP
   layer)

   Fast Handover - A handover procedure which does not result in any
   excessive packet transfer delay. This procedure should not introduce
   any noticeable extra delays which can cause degraded performance of
   service.  To put it succinctly, low delay.

   Smooth Handover -  A handover procedure which does not result in any
   packet loss. This procedure should not lose user data and is
   tolerant to some delay in the procedure execution.  To put it
   succinctly, low loss.

   Seamless Handover - A handover procedure which does not result in
   any degradation of service noticeable by a user. This procedure has

   strict timing requirement for the execution and is tolerant to some
   packet loss. To put it succinctly, seamless handover = fast handover
   + smooth handover.

1.3 Basic Requirements

   Listed below are the major requirement areas :

     * Mobile IP based solution

     * IPv6 Based

     * Split in micro- and macro-mobility regions

     * Layer 2 Information Should Not Be Relied Upon

     * Minimize Air Interface Signaling

     * Interworking between IP and Radio specific Mobility Management

     * Idle Mode Support

     * Handover Performance

     * Security Requirements

2  Services

2.1  Paging

   In cellular networks the concept of "paging area" (or location
   area/routing area) is defined. Paging areas are used to locate an MN
   in idle mode in order to deliver incoming calls. The MN in idle mode
   keeps the network informed of its location at the level of
   location/routing area, i.e. indicates its current location/routing
   area to the network any time there is a change in the
   location/routing area.

   A location/routing area usually encompasses more than a base-station
   area, so that the MN does not drain its battery out by performing
   frequent location/routing area updates. At the same time, the size
   of paging areas shall be such that the signaling load resulting from
   paging is minimized. Paging area size is calculated by optimizing
   the trade off between the two aspects described above.

   The challenge is to manage paging area with involving as little
   radio/layer 2 specific functions as possible.

2.2  Micromobility



Loughney, John                                                [Page 4]
Internet Draft      Seamless Mobility Concerns      November 17, 2000


   Micromobility is the ability for a mobile node to move without
   notifying its home agent.  For the purposes of this draft,
   macromobility is when the mobile node's home agent is notified of
   any movement, or simply conventional Mobile IP.

   There are a number of protocols and architectures seeking to provide
   micromobility, including hierarchical mobile IP [8].  These
   micromobility solutions seek to speed handovers while meeting
   performance goals.

2.3  Context Transfer

   In order to achieve seamless handovers, target access nodes may need
   certain things. These are discussed below.

2.3.1 QoS

   During a handover, the target access node should be able to provide
   the minimum QoS that the mobile node expects. In the event where
   more than one access node is available as the target for a handover,
   the access node providing closest the expected QoS should be
   selected.

2.3.2 Header Compression State

   Header compression may be needed for IP transport over wireless
   links.  IP headers can add a significant overhead compared to the
   radio frames which are sent over tradition cellular air interfaces.
   This problem is being solved by developing header compression
   schemes [2].

   For seamless handovers, the new node must have appropriate
   compression state.  The failure to possess this state could result
   in discarding the uplink packets and transmission of uncompressed
   packets in the downlink. [5]

   It is important to select header compression schemes which can
   sustain the air interface characteristics of errors and packet loss.
   The scheme should also be spectrum efficient during the handovers.

2.3.3 Security

   Security is always a concern, and even more so for mobile nodes.  It
   should be possible that the access nodes involved in a handover can
   exchange security credentials so that AAA process does not need to
   be performed again.

2.3.4 Buffering

   In some cases a number of methods are used to improve the
   performance data flows, such as packet buffering. If the previous

Loughney, John                                                [Page 5]
Internet Draft      Seamless Mobility Concerns      November 17, 2000


   access node has supported such a method or methods then the target
   access node should also support the method(s) or otherwise make sure
   that the service does not degrade visibly due to lack of those
   methods.

   For example, some non standards-track methods may deploy TCP
   acknowledgement manipulation at the access node, i.e. buffering of
   ACKs or modification of acknowledgements.

   In seamless handovers, the target access node should either be able
   to start to support the method by receiving the state or otherwise
   be able to compensate the loss of the method, for example by
   providing higher bandwidth for the flow.

3 Requirements

3.1 Mobile IP based solution

   Mobile IP [1] as developed within the Mobile IP working group is the
   de-facto standard for IP level mobility.  All Seamless Mobility
   solutions should work with Mobile IP, without adding additional
   requirements to Mobile IP.  Extensions to the Mobile IP header are
   acceptable, though.

3.2 IPv6 Based

   "The Case for IPv6" [9] lays out detailed and compelling arguments
   for IPv6.  IPv6 [7] also introduces many mobility improvements
   compared to IPv4, so all work should be designed with IPv6 as a
   baseline.  "Mobility Support in IPv6" [1] discusses the support for
   mobility in IPv6.  In general, IPv6 supports Mobile IP better than
   IPv4.  Some of the benefits listed include:

       *  Support for what is known in Mobile IPv4 as "Route
          Optimization."

       *  Support is also integrated into Mobile IPv6 for allowing
          mobile nodes and Mobile IP to coexist efficiently with
          routers that perform "ingress filtering".

       *  The use of the care-of address as the Source Address in each
          packet's IP header also simplifies routing of multicast
          packets sent by a mobile node.

       *  There is no longer any need to deploy special routers as
          "foreign agents" as are used in Mobile IPv4.

       *  Mobile IPv6 utilizes IP Security (IPsec) for all security
          requirements (sender authentication, data integrity
          protection, and replay protection) for Binding Updates (which
          serve the role of both registration

Loughney, John                                                [Page 6]
Internet Draft      Seamless Mobility Concerns      November 17, 2000



       *  Most packets sent to a mobile node while away from home in
          Mobile IPv6 are sent using an IPv6 Routing header rather than
          IP encapsulation.

       *  Mobile IPv6 defines an Advertisement Interval option on
          Router Advertisements (equivalent to Agent Advertisements in
          Mobile IPv4), allowing a mobile node to decide for itself how
          many Router Advertisements (Agent Advertisements) it is
          willing to miss before declaring its current router
          unreachable.

       *  The use of IPv6 destination options allows all Mobile IPv6
          control traffic to be piggybacked on any existing IPv6
          packets.

   Additionally, IPv4 has limited addressing capacity.  It is assumed
   the growth of the wireless internet will cause an exhaustion of IPv4
   addresses, thus it would not be sensible to design to IPv4. Some
   regions and administrative boundaries are currently facing a
   shortage of IPv4 addresses, due to the original allocation scheme of
   IP addresses.  They will face the exhaustion first. It is highly
   unlikely that they will be satisfied with IPv4 based solutions.

   That being said, interworking with IPv4 networks will be a reality
   for some time, so that solutions should be IPv4 compatible as well.

3.3 Split in micro- and macro-mobility regions.

   An access node manages the physical layer connection to the mobile
   node, including frequently occurring handovers between cells (micro-
   mobility). The handovers can be assumed to occur less frequently at
   the Core Network level (macromobility).

   By splitting mobility into micromobility and macromobility,
   signaling can be reduced; latency can be reduced; packet loss can be
   reduced thus increasing performance.

3.4 Layer 2 Information Should Not Be Relied Upon

   Interaction between layer 2 (radio) and layer 3 (IP Protocols)
   should be minimized. The Internet has a requirement that link layer
   should be transparent to IP Bearer traffic.  That being said,
   certain information may be provided by a specific layer 2 that can
   assist in seamless mobility.  It should be possible to take
   advantage of this information, when available.

   Changes in radio specific layer 2 level mobility functions should be
   limited only to IP Transport Control functions.

Internet Draft      Seamless Mobility Concerns      November 17, 2000


3.5 Minimize Air Interface Signaling

   Bandwidth and frequency spectrum of an air interface may be a
   limited and expensive resource, thus it is important to have radio
   resource management optimized for an efficient use of the available
   spectrum.

   In the existing cellular radio networks the optimization is
   performed in many ways. For instance, by assigning radio resource
   after terrestrial resource assignment in a call setup, by performing
   call audit between the base station and the call processing agent to
   release any stuck radio resources, etc.

   The signaling burden, in general, should be minimized, as it may
   compete with user data.

3.6 Interworking Between IP and Radio Specific Mobility Management.

   There are many devices using radio specific mobility management
   functions (layer 2). It would be desirable to consider the
   interworking between layer 2 and layer 3 mobility management. A
   Seamless Mobility proxy may be needed in order to achieve this.
   This should be studied in further detail.

3.7 Idle Mode Support

   As mobile nodes may be power-constrained, it is likely that they may
   enter some idle mode when not active.  In order to support services,
   it should be possible to page the mobile node when the node is idle.

3.8 Handover Performance

   The implications of seamless mobility on network requirements depend
   on the service itself. For example, the delay and packet loss
   requirements during seamless handover for e-mail transfer are
   obviously much less demanding than those of Voice over IP service.

   For some services Seamless handover may be achieved only with smooth
   handovers or fast handovers, with some other services Seamless
   handovers are required. Moreover, the quantitative requirements of
   smooth or fast handover may vary from service to service.

   For realtime services, handover performance should be no worse than
   for cellular system voice service. During inter-system handover, the
   source system adapts to the target system.

3.9 Security requirements must be met

3.9.1  User Identity

   During session initiation, there is a period during which the MN has

Loughney, John                                                [Page 8]
Internet Draft      Seamless Mobility Concerns      November 17, 2000


   identified itself with the network but the network has not yet
   verified the credentials received from the MT.  At this point,
   no security mechanism can be applied to protect the exchange of
   information between the MN and the network.

   The MN has to identify itself to the network with its subscriber
   identity using unencrypted message. A third-party could possibly
   eavesdrop and listen to this identity, gaining privileged
   information.

   In the existing cellular systems, the MN hides its real identity by
   using a temporary identity provided by the network during previous
   interactions, thus avoiding identification by third parties.

3.9.2 Location Protection

   For security and privacy reasons, users may wish to have their
   location from corresponding nodes. During roaming and handovers, the
   location of an MN should be kept securely in the network and not
   revealed to the correspondent nodes.
