NAME=VALUE
     Required.  The name of the state information (``cookie'') is NAME,
     and its value is VALUE.  NAMEs that begin with $ are reserved for
     other uses and must not be used by applications.

     The VALUE is opaque to the user agent and may be anything the
     origin server chooses to send, possibly in a server-selected
     printable ASCII encoding.  ``Opaque'' implies that the content is
     of interest and relevance only to the origin server.  The content
     may, in fact, be readable by anyone that examines the Set-Cookie2
     header.

Comment=comment
     Optional.  Because cookies can contain private information about a
     user, the Comment attribute allows an origin server to document how
     it intends to use the cookie.  The user can inspect the information
     to decide whether to initiate or continue a session with this
     cookie.

Domain=domain
     Optional.  The Domain attribute specifies the domain for which the
     cookie is valid.  An explicitly specified domain must always start
     with a dot.

Max-Age=delta-seconds
     Optional.  The Max-Age attribute defines the lifetime of the
     cookie, in seconds.  The delta-seconds value is a decimal non-
     negative integer.  After delta-seconds seconds elapse, the client
     should discard the cookie.  A value of zero means the cookie should
     be discarded immediately.

Path=path
     Optional.  The Path attribute specifies the subset of URLs on the
     origin server to which this cookie applies.

Version=version
     Required.  The Version attribute, a decimal integer, identifies to
     which version of the state management specification the cookie
     conforms.  For this specification, Version=1 applies.
