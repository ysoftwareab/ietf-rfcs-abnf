1.  Introduction

   JMAP ([RFC8620] - JSON Meta Application Protocol) is a generic
   protocol for synchronising data, such as mails, calendars or
   contacts, between a client and a server.  It is optimised for mobile
   and web environments, and aims to provide a consistent interface to
   different data types.

   This specification defines a data model for handling quotas over
   JMAP, allowing you to read and explain quota information.

   This specification does not address quota administration, which
   should be handled by other means.

1.1.  Notational conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Type signatures, examples and property descriptions in this document
   follow the conventions established in section 1.1 of [RFC8620].  Data
   types defined in the core specification are also used in this
   document.

   Servers MUST support all properties specified for the new data types
   defined in this document.

1.2.  Terminology

   The same terminology is used in this document as in the core JMAP
   specification.

   The term Quota (with that specific capitalization) is used to refer
   to the data type defined in this document and instance of that data
   type.

1.3.  Addition to the capabilities object

   The capabilities object is returned as part of the JMAP Session
   object; see [RFC8620], section 2.

   This document defines one additional capability URI.

1.3.1.  urn::ietf::params::jmap::quota

   This represents support for the Quota data type and associated API
   methods.  The value of this property in the JMAP session capabilities
   property is an empty object.

   The value of this property in an account's accountCapabilities
   property is an object that MUST contain the following information on
   server capabilities and permissions for that account:

   *  *quotaIds:* "Id[]" (default: "[]") A list of quota ids bound to
      that account, or "[]" if that account has no quota restrictions.

1.4.  Data types

   In addition to the standard JSON data types, a couple of additional
   data types are common to the definition of Quota objects and
   properties.

1.4.1.  Scope

   The *Scope* is a "String" from an enumeration defined list of values,
   handled by the server.

   It explains the entities this value applies to.  Some custom
   specifications might provide some additional values.  If the client
   does not specify custom scope specifications in the "using" parameter
   of the request, the server should respond the JSON value "null",
   instead of answering a scope value that the client does not support.
   Standard values are:

   *  "account": Applies for this account

   *  "domain": All accounts of this domain share this part of the quota

   *  "global": All accounts of this server share this part of the quota

1.4.2.  ResourceType

   The *ResourceType* is a "String" from an enumeration defined list of
   values, handled by the server.

   A resource type is like an unit of measure for the quota usage.  Some
   custom specifications might provide some additional values.  If the
   client does not specify custom resource type specifications in the
   "using" parameter of the request, the server should respond the JSON
   value "null", instead of answering a resource type value that the
   client does not support.  Standard values are:

   *  "count": The quota is measured in number of data type objects.
      For example, a quota can have a limit of 50 "Mail" objects.

   *  "size": The quota is measured in size (in "bytes").  For example,
      a quota can have a limit of 25000 "bytes".

1.5.  Push

   Servers MUST support the JMAP push mechanisms, as specified in
   [RFC8620] Section 7, to receive notifications when the state changes
   for the Quota type defined in this specification.

2.  Quota

   The quota is an object that displays the limit set to an account
   usage as well as the current usage in regard to that limit.

   The quota object MUST contain the following fields:

   *  *id*: "Id" The unique identifier for this object.  It should
      respect the JMAP ID datatype defined in section 1.2 of [RFC8620]

   *  *resourceType*: "ResourceType" The resource type of the quota.

Internet-Draft                 JMAP Quotas                   August 2021


   *  *used*: "UnsignedInt" The current usage of the defined quota.
      Computation of this value is handled by the server.

   *  *limit*: "UnsignedInt" The hard limit set by this quota object.
      No more outgoing and ingoing objects should be allowed if we reach
      this limit.  It should be higher than the "warnLimit" and the
      "softLimit".

   *  *scope*: "Scope" The "Scope" of this quota.

   *  *name*: "String" The name of the quota object.  Useful for
      managing quotas and use queries for searching.

   *  *datatypes*: "String[]" A list of all the data types values that
      are applying to this quota.  This allows to assign quotas to
      separated or shared data types.  This MAY include data types the
      client does not recognise.  Clients MUST ignore any unknown data
      type in the list.

   The quota object MAY contain the following field:

   *  *warnLimit*: "UnsignedInt|null" The warn limit set by this quota
      object.  It can be used to send a warning to an entity about to
      reach the hard limit soon, but with no action taken yet.  If set,
      it should be lower than the "softLimit" and the "limit".

   *  *softLimit*: "UnsignedInt|null" The soft limit set by this quota
      object.  It can be used to still allow some operations, but
      refusing some others.  What is allowed or not is up to the server.
      If set, it should be higher than the "warnLimit" but lower than
      the "limit".

   *  *description*: "String|null" Arbitrary free, human readable,
      description of this quota.  Might be used to explain where the
      limit comes from and explain the entities and data types this
      quota applies to.

2.1.  Quota/get

   Standard "/get" method as described in [RFC8620] section 5.1.  The
   ids argument may be "null" to fetch all at once.

2.2.  Quota/changes

   Standard "/changes" method as described in [RFC8620] section 5.2 but
   with one extra argument to the response:

Internet-Draft                 JMAP Quotas                   August 2021


   *  *updatedProperties*: "String[]|null" If only the "used" Quota
      properties has changed since the old state, this will be the list
      of properties that may have changed.  If the server is unable to
      tell if only "used" has changed, it MUST just be null.

   Since "used" frequently changes but other properties are generally
   only changed rarely, the server can help the client optimise data
   transfer by keeping track of changes to Quota usage separate from
   other state changes.  The updatedProperties array may be used
   directly via a back-reference in a subsequent Quota/get call in the
   same request, so only these properties are returned if nothing else
   has changed.

   Servers MAY decide to add other properties to the list that they
   judge changing frequently.

2.3.  Quota/query

   This is a standard "/query" method as described in [RFC8620],
   Section 5.5.

   A *FilterCondition* object has the following properties, any of which
   may be omitted:

   *  *name*: "String" The Quota _name_ property contains the given
      string.

   *  *scopes*: "Scope[]" The Quota _scope_ property must be in this
      list to match the condition.

   *  *resourceTypes*: "ResourceType[]" The Quota _resourceType_
      property must be in this list to match the condition.

   *  *datatypes*: "String[]" The Quota _datatypes_ property must
      contain the elements in this list to match the condition.

   A Quota object matches the FilterCondition if and only if all of the
   given conditions match.  If zero properties are specified, it is
   automatically true for all objects.

   The following Quota properties MUST be supported for sorting:

   *  *name*

   *  *used*
