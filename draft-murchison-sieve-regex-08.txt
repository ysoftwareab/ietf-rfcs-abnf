Abstract

    In some cases, it is desirable to have a string matching mechanism
    which is more powerful than a simple exact match, a substring match
    or a glob-style wildcard match.  The regular expression matching
    mechanism defined in this draft should allow users to isolate just
    about any string or address in a message header or envelope.

Internet Draft          Sieve -- Regex Extension        October 25, 2005



0.     Meta-information on this draft

    This information is intended to facilitate discussion.  It will be
    removed when this document leaves the Internet-Draft stage.


0.1.   Discussion

    This draft is intended to be an extension to the Sieve mail filtering
    language, available from the RFC repository as
    <ftp://ftp.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3028.txt>.

    This draft and the Sieve language itself are being discussed on the
    MTA Filters mailing list at <ietf-mta-filters@imc.org>.  Subscription
    requests can be sent to <ietf-mta-filters-request@imc.org> (send an
    email message with the word "subscribe" in the body).  More
    information on the mailing list along with a WWW archive of back
    messages is available at <http://www.imc.org/ietf-mta-filters/>.


0.2.   Noted Changes Since -07

    Updated boilerplate.


0.3.   Open Issues

    The major open issue with this draft is what to do, if anything,
    about localization/internationalization.  Are [POSIX.2] collating
    sequences and character equivalents sufficient?  Should we reference
    the unicode technical specification?  Should we punt and publish the
    document as experimental?

    Should we allow shorthands such as \b (word boundary) and \w (word
    character)?

    Should we allow backreferences (useful for matching double words,
    etc.)?

    Should we integrate with variables, so that $1, $2, ...  correspond
    to the first, second, ... groups within the regex?


1.  Introduction

    This is an extension to the Sieve language defined by [SIEVE] for
    comparing strings to regular expressions.

    Conventions for notations are as in [SIEVE] section 1.1, including
    use of [KEYWORDS].


2.  Capability Identifier

    The capability string associated with the extension defined in this
    document is "regex".


3.  Regex Match Type

    Commands that support matching may take the optional tagged argument
    ":regex" to specify that a regular expression match should be
    performed.  The ":regex" match type is subject to the same rules and
    restrictions as the standard match types defined in [SIEVE].  For
    convenience, the "MATCH-TYPE" syntax element defined in [SIEVE] is
    augmented here as follows:

         MATCH-TYPE  =/  ":regex"

    Example:

          require "regex";

          # Try to catch unsolicited email.
          if anyof (
            # if a message is not to me (with optional +detail),
            not address :regex ["to", "cc", "bcc"]
              "me(\\+.*)?@company\\.com",

            # or the subject is all uppercase (no lowercase)
            header :regex :comparator "i;octet" "subject"
              "^[^[:lower:]]+$" ) {

            discard;     # junk it
          }

    The ":regex" match type is compatible with both the "i;octet" and
    "i;ascii-casemap" comparators and may be used with them.

    Implementations MUST support extended regular expressions (EREs) as
    defined by [POSIX.2].  Any regular expression not defined by
    [POSIX.2], as well as [POSIX.2] basic regular expressions, word
    boundaries and backreferences are not supported by this extension.
    Implementations SHOULD reject regular expressions that are
    unsupported by this specification as a syntax error.

    The following table provides a brief summary of the regular
    expressions that MUST be supported.  This table is presented here
    only as a guideline.  [POSIX.2] should be used as the definitive
    reference.


    +------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
    | Expression |  Pattern                                            |
    +------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
    |                Items to match a single character                 |
    +------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
    |     .      |  Match any single character except newline.         |
    |    [ ]     |  Bracket expression.  Match any one of the enclosed |
    |            |  characters.  A hypen (-) indicates a range of      |
    |            |  consecutive characters.                            |
    |   [^  ]    |  Negated bracket expression.  Match any one         |
    |            |  character NOT in the enclosed list.  A hypen (-)   |
    |            |  indicates a range of consecutive characters.       |
    |    \\      |  Escape the following special character (match      |
    |            |  the literal character).  Undefined for other       |
    |            |  characters.                                        |
    |            |  NOTE: Unlike [POSIX.2], a double-backslash is      |
    |            |  required as per section 2.4.2 of [SIEVE].          |
    +------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
    |   Items to be used within a bracket expression (localization)    |
    +------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

    |            |  digit, graph, lower, print, punct, space,          |
    |            |  upper, xdigit).                                    |
    |   [= =]    |  Character equivalents.                             |
    |   [. .]    |  Collating sequence.                                |
    +------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
    |  Quantifiers - Items to count the preceding regular expression   |
    +------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
    |     ?      |  Match zero or one instances.                       |
    |     *      |  Match zero or more instances.                      |
    |     +      |  Match one or more instances.                       |
    |   {n,m}    |  Match any number of instances between              |
    |            |  n and m (inclusive).  {n} matches exactly n        |
    |            |  instances.  {n,} matches n or more instances.      |
    +------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
    |              Anchoring - Items to match positions                |
    +------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
    |     ^      |  Match the beginning of the line or string.         |
    |     $      |  Match the end of the line or string.               |
    +------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

4.  Security Considerations

    Security considerations are discussed in [SIEVE].  It is believed
    that this extension doesn't introduce any additional security
    concerns.

    However, a poor implementation COULD introduce security problems
    ranging from degradation of performance to denial of service.  If an
    implementation uses a third-party regular expression library, that
    library should be checked for potentially problematic regular
    expressions, such as "(.*)*".


5.  IANA Considerations

    The following template specifies the IANA registration of the Sieve
    extension specified in this document:

    To: iana@iana.org
    Subject: Registration of new Sieve extension

    Capability name: regex
    Capability keyword: regex
    Capability arguments: N/A
