Abstract 
 
Generic requirements for Pseudo Wire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) have 
been described in [3].  This draft lists SONET specific requirements 
and provides encapsulation formats and semantics for connecting SONET 
edge networks through a core packet network using IP, L2TP or MPLS.  
This basic application of SONET interworking will allow SONET service 
providers to take advantage of new technologies in the core in order to 
provide SONET services.

2  Introduction 
    
   This document describes a protocol that performs SONET Emulation 
   over a variety of Packet-Switched Networks (PSNs) as part of the 
   PWE3 Working Group.  The document assumes that the reader is 
   familiar with the PWE3 terminology and concepts described in PWE3 
   requirements and framework documents [3] and [4].  The protocol is 
   titled ôCircuit Emulation over Packetö (CEP).     
    
   The transmission system for circuit-oriented TDM signals is the 
   Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) [5], [9] / Synchronous Digital 
   Hierarchy (SDH) [6]. To support TDM traffic (which includes voice, 
   data, and private leased line services) PSNs must emulate the 
   circuit characteristics of SONET/SDH payloads.  A circuit identifer

   and a CEP header are used to encapsulate the SONET/SDH TDM signals 
   for transmission over an arbitrary PSN.   
    
   This document also describes an optional extension to CEP called 
   Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (DBA).  This is a method for 
   dynamically reducing the bandwidth utilized by emulated SONET/SDH 
   circuits in the packet network.  This bandwidth reduction is 
   accomplished by not sending the SONET/SDH payload through the packet 
   network under certain conditions such as AIS-P or STS SPE 
   Unequipped. 
    
   This document is based on a previous document describing a method 
   for encapsulating SONET signals for carriage over MPLS networks 
   (CEM) [7].  This document is closely related to [8] which describes 
   a MIB for controlling and observing CEP services.   
    

3  Scope 
    
   This document describes how to provide CEP for the following digital 
   signals: 
    
   1. SONET STS-1 synchronous payload envelope (SPE)/SDH VC-3 
    
   2. STS-Nc SPE (N = 3, 12, 48, or 192)/SDH VC-4, VC-4-4c, VC-4-16c, 
      or VC-4-64c 
 
   For the remainder of this document, these constructs will be 
   referred to as SONET/SDH channels.   
    
   Although this document currently covers up to OC-192c/VC-4-64c, 
   future revision MAY address higher rates. 
    
   Other SONET/SDH signals, such as virtual tributary (VT) structured 
   sub-rate mapping, are not explicitly discussed in this document; 
   however, it can be extended in the future to support VT and lower 
   speed non-SONET/SDH services.

4  CEP Encapsulation Format 
    
   In order to transport SONET/SDH SPEs through a packet-oriented 
   network, the SPE is broken into fragments.  A Circuit ID Word and 
   CEP Header are pre-pended to each fragment.  The basic CEP packet 
   appears in Figure 1.

   The Circuit ID Word is a 32-bit field that contains an arbitrary 
   value that is used to map CEP packets to specific SONET/SDH 
   channels.  The circuit ID word is intentionally designed to match 
   the format of an MPLS shim.

   The CEP Header supports a basic and extended mode.  The Basic CEP 
   Header provides the minimum functionality necessary to accurately 
   emulate a TDM SONET over a PSN.  Bit 0 of the first 32-bit CEP 
   header indicates whether or not the extended header is present.  
   When this bit is 0, then no extended header is present.  When this 
   bit is 1, then an extended header is present.  At this time, the 
   contents of the extended header are for future study.  However, it 
   is expected that this field will provide support for payload 
   compression, header protection, enhanced performance monitoring, 
   and/or other extensions to the base protocol. 
    
   The Basic CEP header has the following format: 
    
    0                   1                   2                   3

   The above fields are defined as follows: 
 
   R bit: CEP-RDI.  This bit is set to one to signal to the remote CEP 
   function that a loss of packet synchronization has occurred.  See 
   section 5.4 for details.   
    
   D bit: Signals DBA Mode.  MUST be set to zero for Normal Operation.  
   MUST be set to one if CEP is currently in DBA mode.  DBA is an 
   optional mode during which trivial SPEs are not transmitted into the 
   packet network.  See Table 1 and section 5 for further details.

   Sequence Number[0:13]:  This is a packet sequence number, which MUST 
   continuously cycle from 0 to 0x3FFF.  It SHOULD begin at zero when a 
   CEP channel is created. 
    
   Structure Pointer[0:12]: The Structure Pointer MUST contain the 
   offset of the J1 byte within the CEP SPE Fragment.  The value is 
   from 0 to 0x1FFE, where 0 means the first byte after the CEP header. 
   The Structure Pointer MUST be set to 0x1FFF if a packet does not 
   carry the J1 byte.  See [5], [6] and [9] for more information on the 
   J1 byte and the SONET/SDH payload pointer.  Implementations MUST 
   support SPE Fragments of up to 1023 bytes and MAY support SPE 
   fragments of up to 8191 bytes. 
    
   Note: CEP packets are fixed in length for all of the packets of a 
   particular emulated TDM stream.  This length is statically 
   provisioned for each TDM stream.  Therefore, the length of each CEP 
   packet does not need to be carried in the CEP header. 
    

4.1 PSN Encapsulation 
    
   In principle, CEP packets can be carried over any packet-oriented 
   network.  The following sections describe specifically how CEP 
   packets MUST be encapsulated for carriage over MPLS or IP networks.

4.1.1   MPLS Encapsulation 
    
   To transport a CEP packet over an MPLS network, an MPLS label-stack 
   MUST be pushed on top of the CEP packet.

4.1.2   IP Encapsulation 
    
   It is highly desirable to define a single encapsulation format that 
   will work for both IP and MPLS.  Furthermore, it is desirable that 
   the encapsulation mechanism be as efficient as possible.   
    
   One way to achieve these goals is to map CEP directly onto IP.  
   Because the Circuit ID Word is essentially an MPLS Shim, the CEP 
   packet may be treated as an MPLS packet.  A mechanism for carrying 
   MPLS over IP is described in [10]. 
    
   Using this encapsulation scheme would result in the packet format 
   illustrated in figure 6.

5  CEP Operation 
    
   The following sections describe CEP operation.   
    

5.1 Introduction and Terminology 
 
   CEP MUST support a normal mode of operation and MAY support an 
   optional extension called Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (DBA).  
   During normal operation, SONET/SDH payloads are fragmented, pre-
   pended with the CEP Header, the Circuit ID Word, and the PSN header, 
   and then transmitted into the packet network.  During DBA mode, only 
   the CEP header, the Circuit ID Word, and PSN header are transmitted.  
   This is done to conserve bandwidth when meaningful user data is not 
   present in the SPE, such as during AIS-P or STS SPE Unequipped.   
    
5.1.1   CEP Packetizer and De-Packetizer 
 
   As with all adaptation functions, CEP has two distinct components: 
   adapting TDM SONET/SDH into a CEP packet stream, and converting the 
   CEP packet stream back into a TDM SONET/SDH.  The first function 
   will be referred to as CEP Packetizer and the second as CEP De-
   Packetizer.  This terminology is illustrated in figure 7. 
    
    
             +------------+              +---------------+

             +------------+              +---------------+ 
    
                Figure 7. CEP Terminology 
                 
   Note: the CEP de-packetizer requires a buffering mechanism to 
   account for delay variation in the CEP packet stream.  This 
   buffering mechanism will be generically referred to as the CEP  
   jitter buffer. 
    
5.1.2   CEP DBA 
    
   DBA is an optional mode of operation that only transmits the CEP 
   Header, the Circuit ID Word, and PSN Header into the packet network 
   under certain circumstances such as AIS-P or STS Unequipped.   
    
   If DBA is supported by a CEP implementation, the user SHOULD be able 
   to configure if DBA will be triggered by AIS-P, STS Unequipped, 
   both, or neither on a per channel basis.   
    

  
pwe3-sonet                Expires March 2002                  [Page 9] 

Internet Draft         draft-many-pwe3-sonet-00         September 2001 
 
 
   If DBA is supported, the determination of AIS-P and STS Unequipped 
   MUST be based on the state of SONET/SDH Section, Line, and Path 
   Overhead bytes.   
    
   During AIS-P, there is no valid payload pointer, so pointer 
   adjustments cannot occur.  During STS Unequipped, the SONET/SDH 
   payload pointer is valid, and therefore pointer adjustments MUST be 
   supported even during DBA.  See Table 1 for details. 
    

5.2 Description of Normal CEP Operation 
    
   During normal operation, the CEP packetizer will receive a fixed 
   rate byte stream from a SONET/SDH interface.  When a packets worth 
   of data has been received from a SONET/SDH channel, the CEP Header, 
   the Circuit ID Word, and PSN Header are pre-pended to the SPE 
   fragment and the resulting CEP packet is transmitted into the packet 
   network.  Because all CEP packets associated with a specific 
   SONET/SDH channel will have the same length, the transmission of CEP 
   packets for that channel SHOULD occur at regular intervals.   
    
   At the far end of the packet network, the CEP de-packetizer will 
   receive packets into a jitter buffer and then play out the received 
   byte stream at a fixed rate onto the corresponding SONET/SDH 
   channel.  The jitter buffer SHOULD be adjustable in length to 
   account for varying network delay behavior.  The receive packet rate 
   from the packet network should be exactly balanced by the 
   transmission rate onto the SONET/SDH channel, on average.  The time 
   over which this average is taken corresponds to the depth of the 
   jitter buffer for a specific CEP channel. 
    
   The CEP sequence numbers provide a mechanism to detect lost and/or 
   mis-ordered packets.  The CEP de-packetizer MUST detect lost or mis-
   ordered packets.  The CEP de-packetizer SHOULD play out an all ones 
   pattern (AIS) in place of any dropped packets.  The CEP de-
   packetizer MAY re-order packets received out of order.  If the CEP 
   de-packetizer does not support re-ordering, it must drop mis-ordered 
   packets. 
    

5.3 Description of CEP Operation during DBA 
    
   There are several issues that should be addressed by a workable CEP 
   DBA mechanism.  First, when DBA is invoked, there should be a 
   substantial savings in bandwidth utilization in the packet network.  
   The second issue is that the transition in and out of DBA should be 
   tightly coordinated between the local CEP packetizer and CEP de-
   packetizer at the far side of the packet network.  A third is that 
   the transition in and out of DBA should be accomplished with minimal 
   disruption to the adapted data stream. 
    

  
pwe3-sonet                Expires March 2002                 [Page 10] 

Internet Draft         draft-many-pwe3-sonet-00         September 2001 
 
 
   Another goal is that the reduction of CEP traffic due to DBA should 
   not be mistaken for a fault in the packet network or vice-versa.  
   Finally, the implementation of DBA should require minimal 
   modifications beyond what is necessary for the nominal CEP case.  
   The mechanism described below is a reasonable balance of these 
   goals. 
    
   During DBA, packets MUST be emitted at exactly the same rate as they 
   would be during normal operation.  This SHOULD be accomplished by 
   transmitting each DBA packet after a complete packet of data has 
   been received from the SONET/SDH channel.  The only change from 
   normal operation is that the CEP packets during DBA MUST only carry 
   the CEP header, the Circuit ID Word, and the PSN Header.  Because 
   some links have a minimum supported packet size, the CEP packetizer 
   MAY append a configurable number of bytes immediately after the CEP 
   header to pad out the CEP packet to reach the mimumum supported 
   packet size.  The D-bit MUST be set to one, to indicate that DBA is 
   active. 
    
   The CEP de-packetizer MUST assume that each packet received with the 
   D-bit set represents a normal-sized packet containing an AIS-P or 
   SPE Unequipped payload as noted by N and P.  See Table 1.  The CEP 
   de-packetizer MUST accept DBA packets with or without padding. 
    
   This allows the CEP packetization and de-packetization logic during 
   DBA to be similar to the nominal case.  It ensures that the correct 
   SONET/SDH indication is reliably transmitted between CEP adaptation 
   points.  It minimizes the risk of under or over running the jitter 
   buffer during the transition in and out of DBA, since packets are 
   continuously transmitted during DBA.  And, it guarantees that faults 
   in the packet network are recognized as distinctly different from 
   line conditioning on the SONET/SDH interfaces. 
    

5.4 Packet Synchronization 
    
   A key component in declaring the state of a CEP service is whether 
   or not the CEP de-packetizer is in or out of packet synchronization.  
   The following paragraphs describe how that determination is made. 
    
   As discussed in section 5, a CEP de-packetizer MAY or MAY NOT 
   support re-ordering of mis-ordered packets.   
    
   As packets are received from the PSN, they are placed into a jitter 
   buffer prior to play out on the SONET interface.  If a CEP de-
   packetizer supports re-ordering, any packet received before itÆs 
   play out time will still be considered valid. 
    
   If a CEP de-packetizer does not support re-ordering, a number of 
   approaches may be used to minimize the impact of mis-ordered or lost 
   packets on the final re-assembled SONET stream.  For example, AAL1 
   [11] uses a simple state-machine to re-order packets in a sub-set of 
  
pwe3-sonet                Expires March 2002                 [Page 11] 

Internet Draft         draft-many-pwe3-sonet-00         September 2001 
 
 
   possible cases.  The algorithm for these state-machines is outside 
   of the scope of CEP.   
    
   However, the final determination as to whether or not to declare 
   acquisition or loss of packet synchronization MUST be based on the 
   same criteria regardless of whether an implementation supports or 
   does not support re-ordering. 
    
   Therefore, the determination of acquisition or loss of packet 
   synchronization is always made at SONET play-out time.  During SONET 
   play-out, the CEP de-packetizer will play received CEP packets onto 
   the SONET interface.  However, if the jitter buffer is empty or the 
   packet to be played out has not been received, the CEP de-packetizer 
   will have to play out an empty packet onto the SONET interface in 
   place of the unavailable packet.   
    
   The acquisition of packet synch is based on the number of sequential 
   CEP packets that are played onto the SONET interface.  While, loss 
   of packet synch is based on the number of sequential æemptyÆ packets 
   that are played onto the SONET interface.  Specific details of these 
   two cases is described below. 
    
    
5.4.1   Acquisition of Packet Synchronization 
    
   At startup, a CEP de-packetizer will be out of packet 
   synchronization by default.  To declare packet synchronization at 
   startup or after a loss of packet synchronization, the CEP de-
   packetizer must play-out a configurable number of CEP packets with 
   sequential sequence numbers towards the SONET interface.   
    
5.4.2   Loss of Packet Synchronization 
    
   Once a CEP de-packetizer is in packet sync, it may encounter a set 
   of events that will cause it to lose packet synchronization.   
    
    
   If the CEP de-packetizer encounters more than a configurable number 
   of sequentialempty packets, the CEP de-packetizer MUST declare loss 
   of packet synchronization.   
    

6  SONET/SDH Maintenance Signals 
    
   There are several issues that must be considered in the mapping of 
   maintenance signals between SONET/SDH and a PSN.  A description of 
   how these signals and conditions are mapped between the two domains 
   is described below. 
    
   For clarity, the mappings are split into two groups: SONET/SDH to 
   PSN, and PSN to SONET/SDH.

   and Alarm conditions are mapped into a Packet Switched Network.

6.1.1   AIS-P Indication 
    
   In a SONET/SDH network, SONET Path outages are signaled using 
   maintenance alarms such as Path AIS (AIS-P).  In particular, AIS-P 
   indicates that the SONET/SDH Path is not currently transmitting 
   valid end-user data, and the SPE contains all ones.   
    
   It should be noted that nearly every type of service-effecting 
   section or line defect will result in an AIS-P condition. 
    
   The SONET/SDH hierarchy is illustrated below.

   Should the Section Layer detect a Loss of Signal (LOS) or Loss of 
   Frame (LOF) condition, it sends AIS-L up to the Line Layer.  If the 
   Line Layer detects AIS-L or Loss of Path (LOP), it sends AIS-P to 
   the Path Layer.   
    
   In normal mode during AIS-P, CEP packets are generated as usual.  
   The N and P bits MUST be set to 11 binary to signal AIS-P explicitly 
   through the packet network.  The D-bit MUST be set to zero to 
   indicate that the SPE is being carried through the packet network.  
   Normal CEP packets with the SPE fragment, CEP Header, the Circuit ID 
   Word, and PSN Header MUST be transmitted into the packet network.

   However, to conserve network bandwidth during AIS-P, DBA MAY be 
   employed.  If DBA has been enabled for AIS-P and AIS-P is currently 
   occurring, the N and P bits MUST be set to 11 binary to signal AIS, 
   and the D-bit MUST be set to one to indicate that the SPE is not 
   being carried through the packet network.  Only the CEP header, the 
   Circuit ID Word, and the PSN Header MUST be transmitted into the 
   packet network. 
    
6.1.2   STS SPE Unequipped Indication 
    
   The declaration of STS SPE unequipped MUST conform to [9].  Quoted 
   below: 
    
   ôR6-135 [481] STS PTE shall detect an STS Path Unequipped (UNEQ-P) 
   defect within 10 ms of the onset of at least five consecutive 
   samples (which may or may not be consecutive frames) of unequipped 
   STS Signal Labels (C2 byte), as specified in Table 6-2ö 
    
   The termination of STS SPE unequipped MUST also conform to [9]. 
    
   ôR6-137 [485v2] STS PTE shall terminate an UNEQ-P defect within 10 
   ms of the onset of at least five consecutive samples (which may or 
   may not be consecutive frames) of STS Signal Labels that are not 
   unequipped or all-ons, as specified in Table 6-2ö 
    
   For normal operation during SPE Unequipped, the N and P bits MUST be 
   interpreted as usual.  The SPE MUST be transmitted into the packet 
   network along with the CEP Header, the Circuit ID Word, and PSN 
   Header, and the D-Bit MUST be set to zero.  
    
   If DBA has been enabled for STS SPE Unequipped and the Unequipped is 
   occurring on the SONET/SDH channel, the D-bit MUST be set to one to 
   indicate DBA is active.  Only the CEP Header, the Circuit ID Word, 
   and PSN Header MUST be transmitted into the packet network.  The N 
   and P bits MAY be used to signal pointer adjustments as normal.  See 
   Table 1 and section 5 for details. 
 
6.1.3   CEP-RDI 
 
   The CEP function MUST send CEP-RDI towards the packet network during 
   loss of packet synchronization.  This MUST be accomplished by 
   setting the R bit to one in the CEP header.   
    

6.2 PSN to SONET/SDH 
 
   The following sections discuss how the various conditions on the 
   packet network are converted into SONET/SDH indications. 
    
6.2.1   AIS-P Indication 
 

  
pwe3-sonet                Expires March 2002                 [Page 15] 

Internet Draft         draft-many-pwe3-sonet-00         September 2001 
 
 
   There are several conditions in the packet network that will cause 
   the CEP de-packetization function to play out an AIS-P indication 
   towards a SONET/SDH channel.   
    
   The first of these is the receipt of CEP packets with the N and P 
   bits set to one, and the D-bit set to zero.  This is an explicit 
   indication of AIS-P being received at the far-end of the packet 
   network, with DBA disabled for AIS-P.  The CEP de-packetizer MUST 
   play out the received SPE fragment (which will incidentally be 
   carrying all ones), and MUST configure the SONET/SDH Overhead to 
   signal AIS-P as defined in [5], [6], and [9]. 
    
   The second case is the receipt of CEP packets with the N and P bits 
   set to one, and the D-bit set to one.  This indicates that AIS-P is 
   being received at the far-end of the packet network, with DBA 
   enabled for AIS-P.  The CEP de-packetizer MUST play out one packetÆs 
   worth of all ones for each packet received, and MUST configure the 
   SONET/SDH Overhead to signal AIS-P as defined in [5], [6], and [9]. 
    
   A third case that will cause a CEP de-packetization function to play 
   out an AIS-P indication onto a SONET/SDH channel is during loss of 
   packet synchronization.  The CEP de-packetizer MUST configure the 
   SONET/SDH Overhead to signal AIS-P as defined in [5], [6], and [9]. 
    
6.2.2   STS SPE Unequipped Indication 
 
   There are three conditions in the packet network that will cause the 
   CEP function to transmit STS SPE Unequipped indications onto the 
   SONET/SDH channel.  
    
   The first, which is transparent to CEP, is the receipt of regular 
   CEP packets that happen to be carrying an SPE that contains the 
   appropriate Path overhead to signal STS SPE unequipped.  This case 
   does not require any special processing on the part of the CEP de-
   packetizer. 
    
   The second case is the receipt of CEP packets that have the D-bit 
   set to one to indicate DBA active and the N and P bits set to 00 
   binary, 01 binary, or 10 binary to indicate SPE Unequipped with or 
   without pointer adjustments.  The CEP de-packetizer MUST use this 
   information to transmit a packet of all zeros onto the SONET/SDH 
   interface, and adjust the payload pointer as necessary. 
    
   The third case when a CEP de-packetizer MUST play out an STS SPE 
   Unequipped Indication towards the SONET interface is when the VC-
   label has been withdrawn due to de-provisioning of the circuit.   
    

7  SONET/SDH Transport Timing 
    
   It is assumed that the distribution of SONET/SDH Transport timing 
   information is addressed through external mechanisms such as

   Building Integrated Timing System (BITS), Global Positioning System 
   (GPS) or other such methods and is therefore outside of the scope of 
   this specification. 
    

8  SONET/SDH Pointer Management 
    
   A pointer management system is defined as part of the definition of 
   SONET/SDH. Details on SONET/SDH pointer management can be found in 
   [5], [6], and [9].  If there is a frequency offset between the frame 
   rate of the transport overhead and that of the SONET/SDH SPE, then 
   the alignment of the SPE shall periodically slip back or advance in 
   time through positive or negative stuffing.  
    
   The emulation of this aspect of SONET networks may be accomplished 
   using a variety of techniques including (but not limited to) 
   explicit pointer adjustment relay (EPAR) and adaptive pointer 
   management (APM). 
    
   In any case, the handling of the SPE data by the CEP packetizer is 
   the same. 
    
   During a negative pointer adjustment event, the CEP packetizer MUST 
   incorporate the H3 byte from the SONET/SDH stream into the CEP 
   packet payload in order with the rest of the SPE.  During a positive 
   pointer adjustment event, the CEP de-packetizer MUST strip the stuff 
   byte from the CEP packet payload.   
    
   When playing out a negative pointer adjustment event, the 
   appropriate byte of the CEP payload MUST be placed into the H3 byte 
   of the SONET/SDH stream.  When playing out a positive pointer 
   adjustment, the CEP de-packetizer MUST insert a stuff-byte into the 
   appropriate position within the SONET/SDH stream. 
    
   The details regarding the use of the H3 byte and stuff byte during 
   positive and negative pointer adjustments can be found in [5], [6], 
   and [9]. 
    

8.1 Explicit Pointer Adjustment Relay (EPAR) 
    
   CEP provides an OPTIONAL mechanism to explicitly relay pointer 
   adjustment events from one side of the PSN to the other.  This 
   technique will be referred to as Explicit Pointer Adjustment Relay 
   (EPAR).  The mechanics of EPAR are described below.   
    
   The following text only applies to implementations that choose to 
   implement EPAR.  Any CEP implementation that does not support EPAR 
   MUST either set the N and P bits to zero or utilize them to relay 
   AIS-P and STS Unequipped as shown in table 1.

Internet Draft         draft-many-pwe3-sonet-00         September 2001 
 
 
   If EPAR is being used, the pointer adjustment event MUST be 
   transmitted in three consecutive packets by the packetizer. The de-
   packetizer MUST play out the pointer adjustment event when any one 
   packet with N/P bit set is received.   
    
   References [5],[6],and [9] specify that pointer adjustment events 
   MUST be separated by three SONET/SDH frames without a pointer 
   adjustment event.  In order to explicitly relay all legal pointer 
   adjustment events, the packet size for a specific circuit SHOULD be 
   no larger than (783 * 4 * N)/3, where N is the STS-Nc multiplier. 
    
   In addition, it is possible for pointer adjustments to occur in back 
   to back SONET/SDH frames.  In order to support this possibility, 
   EPAR implementations SHOULD set the packet size for a particular 
   circuit to be no larger than (783*N)/3.  Where N is the STS-Nc 
   multiplier.   
    
   Since the minimum value of N is one, EPAR implementations SHOULD 
   support a minimum payload length of 783/3 or 261 bytes.   
    
   For EPAR implementations, the CEP de-packetizer MUST utilize the CEP 
   sequence numbers to insure that SONET/SDH pointer adjustment events 
   are not played any more frequently than once per every three CEP 
   packets transmitted by the remote CEP packetizer.   
    
   If both bits are set, then an AIS-P event has occurred (this is 
   further discussed in section 6).   
    
   When DBA is invoked (i.e. the D-bit = 1), N and P have additional 
   meanings.  See Table 1 and section 5. 
    

8.2 Adaptive Pointer Management (APM) 
    
   Another OPTIONAL method that may be used to emulate SONET pointer 
   management is Adaptive Pointer Management (APM).  In basic terms, 
   APM uses information about the depth of the CEP jitter buffers to 
   introduce pointer adjustments in the reassembled SONET SPE.   
    
   Details about specific APM algorithms is for future study. 
    

9  CEP Performance Monitors 
    
   SONET/SDH as defined in [5], [6], and [9], includes the definition 
   of several counters that may be used to monitor the performance of 
   SONET/SDH services.  These counters are referred to as Performance 
   Monitors. 
    
   In order for CEP to be utilized by traditional SONET/SDH network 
   operators, CEP SHOULD provide similar functionality.  To this end,

Internet Draft         draft-many-pwe3-sonet-00         September 2001 
 
 
   the following sections describe a number of counters that will 
   collectively be referred to as CEP Performance Monitors. 
    

9.1 Near-End Performance Monitors  
    
   These performance monitors are maintained by the CEP De-Packetizer 
   during reassembly of the SONET stream.   
    
   The performance monitors are based on two types of defects.   
    
   Type 1 defect is defined as: missing or dropped packet. 
   Type 2 defect is defined as: buffer under run, buffer over-run, 
   LOPS. 
    
   Each second that contain at least one type 1 defect SHALL be 
   declared as ES-CEP. 
    
   Each second that contain type 2 defect, or missing packets above 
   pre-defined, configurable threshold of missing/dropped packets SHALL 
   be declared both SES-CEP and ES-CEP.  Default value for missing 
   packet to SES is 3. 
    
   UAS-CES shall be declared after X consecutives SES-CEP, cleared 
   after X consecutive seconds without SES-CEP.  Default value of X is 
   10 seconds.  
    
   Once unavailability is declared, ES and SES counts shall be 
   inhibited up to the point where the unavailability was started. Once 
   unavailability is removed, ES that occurred along the X seconds 
   clearing period shall be added to the ES counts. An update is 
   required even for closed intervals if  necessary. 
    
   LOPS failure is declared after 2.5 +/- 0.5 seconds of LOPS defect, 
   and cleared after 10 seconds free of LOPS defect state. The VC is 
   considered down as long as LOPS failure is declared. 
    
   FC-CEP is the number of time type 1 or type 2 defect states were 
   declared.  The NE shall have thresholding on ES-CEP, SES-CEP and 
   UAS-CEP (thresholding mean activate a notification if more than pre-
   defined # of seconds are declared as ES, etc. in 15 minutes 
   interval). 
    

9.2 Far-End Performance Monitors  
    
   These performance monitors provide insight into the CEM De-
   packetizer at the far-end of the PSN. 
    
   Far end statistics are based on the RDI-CEP bit. Limited 
   functionality is supported compared to [GR-253] for simplicity and 
   because it is assumed that all relevant statistics are available

Internet Draft         draft-many-pwe3-sonet-00         September 2001 
 
 
   from the end point of the PW. CEP-FE defect is declared when CEP-RDI 
   is set in the incoming CEP packets. 
    
   CEP-FE failure declared after 2.5 +/- 0.5 seconds of CEP-FE defect, 
   and cleared after 10 seconds free of CES-FE defect state.  Sending 
   notification to the OS for CEP-FE failure is local policy. 
    
   This draft does not attempt to define SES-CEPFE, UAS-CEPFE and FC-
   CEPFE, but they can be added if to fully emulate GR-253 far end PM 
   (thresholding is required too here except for FC-CEPFE). (Note that 
   ES-CEPFE is not relevant since CEP does not report back missing 
   packets - only LOPS which is SES). 
    
   The definition of additional performance monitors is for future 
   study. 
    

10 Open Issues 
    
   This version of the draft does not address payload compression 
   within the emulated SONET.  Payload compression is expected to be 
   supported by future versions of this draft by utilizing the extended 
   CEP header. 
    
   This version of the draft does not tie into PWE3 maintenance 
   mechanisms for the setup and tear down of services.  That short-
   coming will be addressed in future revisions of this document. 
    
   Underlying MPLS QoS requirements are not covered by this revision of 
   the draft.  Future revisions may discuss underlying QoS 
   requirements. 
    
   Support for VT and lower speed non-SONET/SDH services are not 
   covered in this revision of the draft.  Future revisions may address 
   VT and non-SONET/SDH TDM services. 
    
   An alternate version of DBA has been suggested that would suppress 
   transmission of the entire CEP packet stream under certain 
   circumstances.  Future versions of this draft may define such a 
   mechanism.

   Appendix A. SONET/SDH Rates and Formats 
    
   For simplicity, the discussion in this section uses SONET 
   terminology, but it applies equally to SDH as well.  SDH-equivalent 
   terminology is shown in the tables. 
    
   The basic SONET modular signal is the synchronous transport signal-
   level 1 (STS-1). A number of STS-1s may be multiplexed into higher-
   level signals denoted as STS-N, with N synchronous payload envelopes 
   (SPEs). The optical counterpart of the STS-N is the Optical Carrier-
   level N, or OC-N. Table 2 lists standard SONET line rates discussed 
   in this document. 
    
    
     OC Level          OC-1    OC-3    OC-12      OC-48     OC-192 
     SDH Term             -   STM-1    STM-4     STM-16     STM-64 
     Line Rate(Mb/s) 51.840 155.520  622.080  2,488.320  9,953.280 
    
                    Table 2. Standard SONET Line Rates 
    
    
   Each SONET frame is 125 ´s and consists of nine rows. An STS-N frame 
   has nine rows and N*90 columns. Of the N*90 columns, the first N*3 
   columns are transport overhead and the other N*87 columns are SPEs. 
   A number of STS-1s may also be linked together to form a super-rate 
   signal with only one SPE. The optical super-rate signal is denoted 
   as OC-Nc, which has a higher payload capacity than OC-N. 
    
   The first 9-byte column of each SPE is the path overhead (POH) and 
   the remaining columns form the payload capacity with fixed stuff 
   (STS-Nc only).  The fixed stuff, which is purely overhead, is N/3-1 
   columns for STS-Nc.  Thus, STS-1 and STS-3c do not have any fixed 
   stuff, STS-12c has three columns of fixed stuff, and so on. 
    
   The POH of an STS-1 or STS-Nc is always nine bytes in nine rows. The 
   payload capacity of an STS-1 is 86 columns (774 bytes) per frame. 
   The payload capacity of an STS-Nc is (N*87)-(N/3) columns per frame.  
   Thus, the payload capacity of an STS-3c is (3*87 - 1)*9 = 2,340 
   bytes per frame. As another example, the payload capacity of an STS-
   192c is 149,760 bytes, which is exactly 64 times larger than the 
   STS-3c. 
    
   There are 8,000 SONET frames per second. Therefore, the SPE size, 
   (POH plus payload capacity) of an STS-1 is 783*8*8,000 = 50.112 
   Mb/s. The SPE size of a concatenated STS-3c is 2,349 bytes per frame 
   or 150.336 Mb/s. The payload capacity of an STS-192c is 149,760 
   bytes per frame, which is equivalent to 9,584.640 Mb/s. Table 2 
   lists the SPE and payload rates supported.
