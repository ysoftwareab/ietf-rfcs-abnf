                Associating a DoH Server with a Resolver
                draft-hoffman-resolver-associated-doh-04

Abstract

   Browsers and web applications may want to know if there are one or
   more DoH servers associated with the DNS recursive resolver that the
   operating system is already using.  This would allow them to get DNS
   responses from a resolver that the user (or, more likely, the user's
   network administrator) has already chosen.  This document describes a
   protocol for a resolver to tell a client what its associated DoH
   servers are.

1.  Introduction

   DoH [RFC8484] requires that one or more DoH servers be configured for
   the DoH client.  That document does not say how the DoH servers are
   found, nor how to select from a list of possible DoH servers, nor
   what the user interface (UI) for the configuration should be.

   There is a use case for browsers and web applications who have one or
   more currently-configured DNS recursive resolvers wanting to use DoH
   for DNS resolution instead.  (In the rest of this document "browsers
   and web applications" are just called "applications".)  For example,
   the recursive resolver knows how to give correct answers to DNS
   queries that contain names that are only resolvable in the local
   context.  Users typically configure their DNS recursive resolvers
   with through manual configuration (such as manually editing a /etc/
   named.conf file) or through automatic configuration from a protocol
   such as DHCP.

   The client that wants to change from its currently-configured Do53
   recursive resolver(s) to one or more DoH servers might be the stub
   resolver in an operating system, although at this time it is rare
   that such stub resolvers can use DoH.  A much more likely use case is
   an application that is getting name resolution through the stub
   resolver on the computer on which it is running.  The user of the
   application might have a preference for using a DoH server, and they
   might need to use a DoH server that is associated with the resolver

   that the computer is currently using so that its queries for non-
   global names are answered correctly.  They may also be required to
   use only resolvers that are approved by their organization's network
   operators.

   To address these use cases, this document defines a new special use
   domain name (described in [RFC6761]) and a well-known URI
   [I-D.nottingham-rfc5785bis].  When combined, they allow an
   application that can use the POSIX "getaddrinfo()" function and
   resolve HTTP and HTTPS URLs to get a list of the DoH servers
   associated with at least one of the resolvers being used by the
   operating system on the system on which the application is being run.

   It is important to note that using a DoH server based on the protocol
   defined in this document will currently result in communicating with
   opportunistic encryption [RFC7435] using "unauthenticated, encrypted
   communication" instead of "authenticated, encrypted communication".
   This is covered in more detail in Section 8.

   The design choices for this protocol, particularly earlier designs
   that were deemed unusable, are described in Section 5.

2.  Terminology

   In this document, the combination of "browsers and web applications"
   is just called "applications".

   In this document, "DoT" is used to indicate DNS over TLS as defined
   in [RFC7858].

   In this document, "Do53" is used to indicate DNS over UDP or TCP as
   defined in [RFC1035].

   "DoH client" and "DoH server" are defined in [RFC8484].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Finding the DoH Servers Associated with a Resolver

   To find the DoH Servers associated with a resolver, an application
   uses a special use domain name that causes a resolver to return its
   IP addresses.  It uses those IP addresses as part of a well-known URI
   to find out the URI templates [RFC6570] to use for the DoH server(s)
   associated with the resolver.

Internet-Draft           Resolver Associated DoH            October 2018


3.1.  Step 1: Finding the IP Addresses of a Resolver

   An application is able to use the POSIX "getaddrinfo()" function to
   convert host names into IP addresses through the stub resolver in the
   operating system on which it is running.  It can also send queries to
   a resolver, but it would need to have the address of that resolver
   first.

   In order for an application to find the address of the resolver that
   the operating system is using, it uses the POSIX "getaddrinfo()"
   function (or some equivalent) with the special use name "resolver-
   addresses.arpa".  When a resolver that understands this special use
   domain name receives a query for either resolver-addresses.arpa/IN/A
   or resolver-addresses.arpa/IN/AAAA, it returns its own IP addresses
   in the answer.

3.2.  Step 2: Finding the DoH Servers Associated with a Resolver

   To find the DoH servers associated with a resolver, the client uses
   the addresses returned from the query to resolver-addresses.arpa and
   sends a query to:

   https://ADDRESS/.well-known/doh-servers-associated/

   where "ADDRESS" is an IP address discovered in Section 3.1.

   The resolver replies with a list of its associated DoH servers as URI
   Templates [RFC6570].

   [[ Need to describe the media type; likely JSON; and the list
   specifics. ]]

   Note that the well-known URL above uses the HTTPS scheme and no port
   number.  A resolver using the protocol defined in this document MUST
   provide HTTP over TLS on port 443 as defined in [RFC2818].

   A resolver that implements this protocol but has no DoH servers
   associated with it returns an empty list.

   The result of Section 3.1 may be a list of more than one IP
   addresses.  This document does not define a way for an application to
   choose between multiple IP addresses.  For example, the application
   might try all the IP addresses, or try them in random order until it
   gets a result, and so on.

   The result of resolving the well-known URI can be a list of more than
   one URI templates, possibly pointing resources in very different
   places on the Internet.  This document does not define a way for the

Internet-Draft           Resolver Associated DoH            October 2018


   application to choose which DoH servers to use if presented with
   multiple choices.

   An application that is willing to use opportunistic encryption as
   defined in [RFC7435] MAY ignore authentication failures when
   resolving the well-known URL.

   An application that is not willing to use opportunistic encryption as
   defined in [RFC7435] MUST NOT ignore authentication failures when
   going to the well-known URL.  However, as described in Section 8,
   such an application is unlikely to be able to exist today.

   [[ Need to talk about HTTP caching ]]

   A client MUST try to establish a new list of DoH servers associated
   with a resolver every time the configured resolver in the operating
   system changes.

4.  User Interface

   For this protocol to be useful in an application, the application
   needs to have an entry in its configuration interface where the
   allowed DoH servers are listed that indicates that a DoH server from
   the configured Do53 or DoT resolver is allowed.  That wording might
   say something like "DoH server associated with my current resolver".

   This is a place where browsers and web applications are different.
   Most browsers have configuration interfaces, while most web
   applications do not.

5.  Design Choices

   The primary use case for this protocol is an application that is
   getting name resolution through the stub resolver on the computer on
   which it is running wanting to switch its name resolution to DoH.  A
   secondary use case is an OS that wants to make a similar switch.

   An earlier design suggestion was to use a new RRtype with a query to
   ./IN/NEWRRTYPE.  However, it was pointed out that this would not work
   going through stub resolvers that validate DNSSEC.

   An earlier design suggestion was to use DHCP to tell the OS the DoH
   servers that the stub resolver might use.  That protocol is
   orthogonal to the one in this document in that it addresses a
   different use case.  If both the protocol in this document and a
   DHCP-based protocol are standardized, they could co-exist.  However,
   there is no current mechanism for a stub resolver to tell an
   application what DoH server the stub resolver is using, so DoH

Internet-Draft           Resolver Associated DoH            October 2018


   configuration in the stub resolver would not prevent the application
   from trying to find a DoH server on its own.

   An earlier design suggestion was to use an EDNS0 [RFC6891] extension.
   The design chosen in this document meets the use case better because
   applications cannot communicate EDNS0 extensions to the stub
   resolver.

   An earlier design suggestion used a special use domain name of
   resolver-associated-doh.arpa with an RRtype of TXT.  The design
   chosen in this document meets the use case better because
   applications cannot query the stub resolver for types other than
   address records.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA will record the domain name "resolver-addresses.arpa." in the
   "Special-Use Domain Names" registry [SUDN].  IANA MUST NOT delegate
   resolver-addresses.arpa in the .arpa zone.

   [[ When this document settles down, need to register ".well-known/
   doh-servers-associated" as specified in [I-D.nottingham-rfc5785bis].
   ]]

7.  Privacy Considerations

   Allowing an application to use DoH instead of Do53 increases
   communication privacy because of the TLS protection, even if that
   communication is unauthenticated.  If the communication is
   unauthenticated (which it will be using current technologies; see
   Section 8), the communication between the application and the DoH
   server to be private from anyone other than a on-path attacker.

   When a Do53 or DoT server indicates that a particular DoH server is
   associated with it, the application might assume that the DoH server
   has the same information privacy policies as the Do53 or DoT server.
   Therefore, a Do53 or DoT server SHOULD NOT recommend a DoH server
   unless that DoH server has the same (or better) information privacy
   policy as the Do53 or DoT server.

8.  Security Considerations

   [RFC7435] defines "unauthenticated, encrypted communication" and
   "authenticated, encrypted communication".  Those definitions make it
   clear that authentication is needed in every step in order to
   consider communication authenticated and encrypted.

Internet-Draft           Resolver Associated DoH            October 2018


   There is currently no way for an application to know whether the
   operating system's stub resolver is using a transport that assures
   data integrity such as DoT.  This means that the protocol in
   Section 3.1 is not authenticated.  In the future, such a signal might
   be defined and deployed, but until then, the lack of assurance of
   authentication in the first step of this protocol (getting the
   resolver's IP address) means that the result will always be
   unauthenticated.

   Even is an application could determine the use of a transport like
   DoT for Section 3.1, the application would also need to know whether
   the transport was authenticated or was simply chosen
   opportunistically.  Thus, if in the future, a signal about the DNS
   transport being used by the stub resolver might be defined and
   deployed, that signal would also have to specify if the transport is
   also authenticated.

   The protocol defined in Section 3.2 explicitly allows ignoring the
   authentication of the results of resolving the well-known URI.  Doing
   so of course causes the result to be unauthenticated, encrypted
   communication.
