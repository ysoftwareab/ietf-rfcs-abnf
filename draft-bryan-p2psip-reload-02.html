<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>This document defines REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD), a
      peer-to-peer (P2P) binary signaling protocol for usage on the Internet.
      A P2P signaling protocol provides its clients with an abstract hash
      table service between a set of cooperating peers that form the overlay
      network. RELOAD is designed to support a P2P Session Initiation Protocol
      (P2PSIP) network, but it can be utilized by other applications with
      similar requirements by defining new usages that specify the data types
      that must be stored for a particular application, such as location for
      SIP. RELOAD defines a security model based on a certificate enrollment
      service that provides unique identities. NAT traversal is a fundamental
      service of the protocol.
</p>
<p>This draft represents a concrete proposal for the P2PSIP Peer
      Protocol. The protocol described here builds on the lessons and
      experiences from designing and implementing the dSIP, ASP, and RELOAD
      protocols and is a merge of features from RELOAD-01 and ASP.

Introduction</h3>

<p>This document defines REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD), a
      peer-to-peer (P2P) signaling protocol for usage on the Internet. It
      provides a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) service, which allows
      participating nodes to read and write entries into a hash table that is
      stored collectively among the participants. RELOAD is a lightweight,
      binary protocol. It provides several functions that are critical for a
      successful P2P protocol for the Internet. These are:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Security Framework:</dt>
<dd>Security is one of the most
          challenging problems in a P2P protocol. A P2P network will often be
          established among a set of peers none of which trust each other.
          Yet, despite this lack of trust, the network must operate reliably
          to allow storage and retrieval of data. RELOAD defines an abstract
          enrollment server, which all entities trust to generate unique
          identifiers for each user. Using that small amount of trust as an
          anchor, RELOAD defines a security framework that allows for
          authorization of P2P protocol functions and authentication of data
          stored in the overlay.
</dd>
<dt>Usage Model:</dt>
<dd>RELOAD is designed to support a variety
          of applications, including P2P multimedia communications with the
          Session Initiation Protocol <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-p2psip-concepts'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;p2psip&#8209;concepts]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bryan, D., &ldquo;Concepts and Terminology for Peer to Peer SIP,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. Consequently, RELOAD has
          the notion of a usage, one of which is defined to support each
          application (this document also defines the SIP usage for multimedia
          communications). Each usage identifies a set of data types that need
          to be stored and retrieved from the DHT (the SIP usage defines data
          types for registrations, certificates, and Traversal Using Relay NAT
          (TURN) <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-behave-turn'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;behave&#8209;turn]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;Obtaining Relay Addresses from Simple Traversal Underneath           NAT (STUN),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> servers). Each
          type defines a data structure, authorization policies, size quota,
          and information required for storage and retrieval in the DHT. The
          usage concept allows RELOAD to be used with new applications through
          a simple documentation process that supplies the details for each
          application.
</dd>
<dt>NAT Traversal:</dt>
<dd>Operations for NAT traversal are part
          of the base design, including establishing new RELOAD connections
          and tunneling SIP or other application protocols required by P2PSIP.
          RELOAD makes use of Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)
          <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;mmusic&#8209;ice]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for           Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer           Protocols,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> to facilitate the
          creation of the P2P network and the establishment of links for use
          by the application protocol (SIP and RTP, for example). RELOAD also
          defines how peers in the P2P network act as STUN and TURN servers
          and how those resources can be discovered through the DHT. With
          these features, RELOAD can run in modes in which all the peers are
          behind NATs, yet are able to fully participate without imposing any
          constraints on the actual DHT algorithm or routing topology.
</dd>
<dt>High Performance Routing:</dt>
<dd>The very nature of DHT
          algorithms introduces a requirement that peers participating in the
          P2P network route requests on behalf of other peers in the network.
          This introduces a load on those other peers, in the form of
          bandwidth and processing power. RELOAD has been defined to reduce
          the amount of bandwidth and processing required of peers. It does so
          by using a very lightweight binary protocol, and furthermore, by
          defining a packet structure that facilitates low-complexity
          forwarding, including hardware-based forwarding. In particular, a
          fixed-length header is used for routing the message through the
          overlay without the contents needing to be parsed by (or even
          visible to) intermediate peers. The header includes no information
          about specific IP addresses because none are needed to route along
          an overlay. The header only includes lists of peers which the
          message should be routed through/too, as well as some minor options
          and version flags. Clearly separating the header components
          necessary for routing from the message contents simplifies
          processing and increases security.
</dd>
<dt>Transport Flexibility:</dt>
<dd>RELOAD has native support for
          both DTLS and TLS for the underlying transport protocol, with
          support for DTLS over UDP as mandatory to implement. TLS over TCP is
          preferred because it has better bulk performance and connection
          stability, but UDP is more likely to provide direct connections
          between peers in the presence of NATs. Explicit support for
          fragmentation is provided and required when using UDP. Because there
          is no single universally available and suitable transport protocol,
          the peer protocol must be flexible in this regard. New transports
          can be supported trivially.
</dd>
<dt>Pluggable DHT Algorithms:</dt>
<dd>RELOAD has been designed
          with an abstract interface to the DHT layer to simplify implementing
          a variety of DHT algorithms. This specification also defines how
          RELOAD is used with Chord, which is mandatory to implement.
          Specifying a default "must implement" DHT will allow
          interoperability, while the extensibility allows selection of DHTs
          optimized for a particular application.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>These properties were designed specifically to meet the requirements
      for a P2P protocol to support SIP. However, RELOAD is not limited to
      usage by SIP and could serve as a tool for supporting other P2P
      applications with similar needs. RELOAD is also based on the concepts
      introduced in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-p2psip-concepts'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;p2psip&#8209;concepts]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bryan, D., &ldquo;Concepts and Terminology for Peer to Peer SIP,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.

<a name="rfc.section.1.1.1"></a><h3>1.1.1.&nbsp;
Usage Layer</h3>

<p>The top layer, called the Usage Layer, has application usages,
          such as the SIP Location Usage, that use the abstract distributed
          storage API to store and retrieve data from the DHT. The goal of
          this layer is to implement application-specific usages of the
          Overlay Routing and Storage Layer below it. The Usage defines how a
          specific application maps its data into something that can be stored
          in the DHT, where to store the data, how to secure the data, and
          finally how applications can retrieve and use the data.
</p>
<p>The architecture diagram shows both a SIP usage and an XMPP
          usage. A single application may require multiple usages. A usage may
          define multiple types of data that are stored in the overlay and may
          also rely on types originally defined by other usages. A usage is
          not itself encoded on the wire --- only the types are --- but is
          rather a specification of the functionality that is required for a
          given application.
</p>
<p>One usage may depend on another. For example, the SIP usage
          depends on a Certificate Store usage (not shown in the diagram) to
          obtain the certificates required to authenticate messages. Because
          certificates are stored in standard X.509 form, there is no reason
          for each usage to specify this service independently.

<a name="rfc.section.1.1.2"></a><h3>1.1.2.&nbsp;
Overlay Routing and Storage Layer</h3>

<p>The Overlay Routing and Storage Layer stores and retrieves
          information, performs maintenance of the DHT as peers join and leave
          the DHT, and routes messages on the overlay. The DHT implementation
          is provided by a pluggable component so that each overlay can select
          an appropriate DHT that relies on the common RELOAD core code.
</p>
<p>The Overlay Routing and Replication Logic provides a fairly
          generic interface that allows the DHT implementation to control the
          overlay and resource operations and messages. Since each DHT is
          defined and functions differently, we generically refer to the table
          of other peers that the DHT maintains and uses to route requests
          (neighbors) as a Routing Table. The Logic component makes queries to
          the DHT's Routing Table to determine the next hop, then encodes and
          sends the message itself. Similarly, the DHT issues periodic update
          requests through the logic component to maintain and update its
          Routing Table.
</p>
<p>The DHT shown in the illustration is Chord, but a variety of DHT
          algorithms are possible through a pluggable interface. A single node
          could be functioning in multiple overlays simultaneously, each using
          its own DHT algorithm. Each peer is identified by and its location
          in the overlay determined by its Peer-ID that is assigned by the
          enrollment server when the user or peer first enrolls in the
          overlay. The Peer-ID also determines the range of Resource-IDs for
          which it will be responsible. The exact mapping between these is
          determined by the DHT algorithm used by the overlay, therefore the
          logic component always queries the DHT to determine where a
          particular resource should be stored.
</p>
<p>As peers enter and leave, resources may be stored on different
          peers, so the information related to them is exchanged as peers
          enter and leave. Redundancy is used to protect against loss of
          information in the event of a peer failure and to protect against
          compromised or subversive peers. The Logic component notifies the
          DHT as neighbors join and leave, and the DHT updates its Routing
          Table and issues resource migration requests as appropriate.

Forwarding Layer</h3>

<p>This layer is responsible for getting a packet to the next peer,
          as determined by the Routing and Storage Layer. The Forwarding Layer
          establishes and maintains the network connections required by the
          DHT's Routing Table. This layer is also responsible for setting up
          connections to other peers through NATs and firewalls using ICE, and
          it can elect to forward traffic using relays for NAT and firewall
          traversal.

<a name="rfc.section.1.2"></a><h3>1.2.&nbsp;
Security</h3>

<p>RELOAD's security framework is built upon an enrollment server. The
        enrollment server issues each new peer a certificate that assigns it a
        Peer-ID. By generating the Peer-IDs randomly and controlling what
        peers are issued certificates, the enrollment server protects against
        many of the attacks on the overlay network. Similarly, all users are
        issued certificates for their identities by the enrollment server. All
        resources stored on the overlay must be signed by their creator, thus
        ensuring that an attacker cannot forge data belonging to another user.
        The enrollment process is a one-time-only procedure. The peer or user
        do not have to communicate further with it once they have obtained
        their certificates.
</p>
<p>TLS or DTLS are used for communication between peers. In
        combination with the certificates, this provides both confidentiality
        and authentication for communication across the overlay. Applications
        such as P2PSIP can also make use of the users' certificates to achieve
        secure end-to-end connections at the application layer.
</p>
<p>In addition to the enrollment server model, RELOAD offers a
        security model using a pre-shared-key. Although this provides
        significantly less security than is provided through an enrollment
        server, it allows ad hoc or ephemeral overlays to be set up with
        minimal effort on the part of the users.

<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>DHT:</dt>
<dd>
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>A distributed hash table. A DHT is an abstract hash table service
          realized by storing the contents of the hash table across a set of
          peers.
</dd>
<dt>DHT Algorithm:</dt>
<dd>An algorithm that defines the rules for
          determining which peers in a DHT store a particular piece of data
          and for determining a topology of interconnections amongst peers in
          order to find a piece of data. Examples of DHT algorithms are Chord,
          Bamboo and Tapestry.
</dd>
<dt>DHT Instance:</dt>
<dd>A specific hash table and the collection
          of peers that are collaborating to provide read and write access to
          it. There can be any number of DHT instances running in an IP
          network at a time, and each operates in isolation of the others.
</dd>
<dt>P2P Network:</dt>
<dd>Another name for a DHT instance.
</dd>
<dt>P2P Network Name:</dt>
<dd>A string that identifies a unique
          P2P network. P2P network names look like DNS names - for example,
          "example.org". Lookup of such a name in DNS would typically return
          services associated with the DHT, such as enrollment servers,
          bootstrap peers, or gateways (for example, a SIP gateway between a
          traditional SIP and a P2P SIP network called "example.com").
</dd>
<dt>Resource-ID:</dt>
<dd>A non-human-friendly value that
          identifies some resources and which is used as a key for storing and
          retrieving the resource. One way to generate a Resource-ID is by
          applying a mapping function to some other unique name (e.g., User
          Name or Service Name) for the resource. The Resource-ID is used by
          the distributed database algorithm to determine the peer or peers
          that are responsible for storing the data for the overlay.
</dd>
<dt>Peer:</dt>
<dd>A host that is participating in the DHT. By
          virtue of its participation it can store data and is responsible for
          some portion of the overlay.
</dd>
<dt>Peer-ID:</dt>
<dd>A Resource-ID that uniquely identifies a
          peer. Peer-IDs 0 and 2^N - 1 are reserved and are invalid peer-IDs.
          A value of zero is not used in the wire protocol but can be used to
          indicate an invalid peer in implementations and APIs. The peer-id of
          2^N-1 is used on the wire protocol as a wildcard.
</dd>
<dt>Resource:</dt>
<dd>An object associated with an identifier. The
          identifier for the object is a string that can be mapped into a
          Resource-ID by using the string as a seed to the hash function. A
          SIP resource, for example, is identified by its AOR.
</dd>
<dt>User:</dt>
<dd>A human being.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote><p> 
<p>We also introduce the following important new terms.
</p>
      
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Connection Table:</dt>
<dd>The set of peers to which a peer is
          directly connected. This includes peers with which CONNECT
          handshakes have been done but which have not sent any UPDATEs.
</dd>
<dt>Routing Table:</dt>
<dd>The set of peers which a peer can use
          to route DHT messages. In general, these peers will all be on the
          connection table but not vice versa, because some peers will have
          CONNECTed but not sent updates. Peers may send messages directly to
          peers which are on the connection table but may only route messages
          to other peers through peers which are on the routing table.
</dd>
<dt>Seed:</dt>
<dd>A seed is a string used as an input to a hash
          function, the result of which is a Resource-ID.
</dd>
<dt>Usage:</dt>

Distributed Storage Layer</h3>

<p>Each logical address in the DHT where data can be stored is
        referred to as a Resource-ID. A given peer will be responsible for
        storing data from many Resource-ID locations. Typically literature on
        DHTs uses the term "key" to refer to a location in the DHT; however,
        in this specification the term key is used to refer to public or
        private keys used for cryptographic operations and the term
        Resource-ID is used to refer to a location for storage in the DHT.

DHT Concepts</h3>

<p>While very early P2P systems used flood based techniques, most
          newer P2P systems locate resources using a Distributed Hash Table,
          or DHT to improve efficiency. Peers are organized using a
          Distributed Hash Table (DHT) structure. In such a system, every
          resource has a Resource-ID, which is obtained by hashing some
          keyword or value that uniquely identifies the resource. Resources
          can be thought of as being stored in a hash table at the entry
          corresponding to their Resource-ID. The peers that make up the
          overlay network are also assigned an ID, called a Peer-ID, in the
          same hash space as the Resource-IDs. A peer is responsible for
          storing all resources that have Resource-IDs near the peer's
          Peer-ID. The hash space is divided up so that all of the hash space
          is always the responsibility of some particular peer, although as
          peers enter and leave the system a particular peer's area may
          change. Messages are exchanged between the peers in the DHT as the
          peers enter and leave to preserve the structure of the DHT and
          exchange stored entries. Various DHT implementations may visualize
          the hash space as a grid, circle, or line.
</p>
<p>Peers keep information about the location of other peers in the
          hash space and typically know about many peers nearby in the hash
          space, and progressively fewer more distant peers. We refer to this
          table of other peers as a Routing Table. When a peer wishes to
          search, it consults the list of peers it is aware of and contacts
          the peer with the Peer-ID nearest the desired Resource-ID. If that
          peer does not know how to find the resource, it either returns
          information about a closer peer it knows about, or forwards the
          request to a closer peer. In this fashion, the request eventually
          reaches the peer responsible for the resource, which then replies to
          the requester.

DHT Topology</h3>

<p>Each DHT will have a somewhat different structure, but many of
          the concepts are common. The DHT defines a large space of
          Resource-IDs, which can be thought of as addresses. In many DHTs,
          the Resource-IDs are simply 128- or 160-bit integers. Each DHT also
          has a distance metric such that we can say that Resource-ID A is
          closer to Resource-ID B than to Resource-ID C. When the Resource-IDs
          are n-bit integers, they are often considered to be arranged in a
          ring so that (2^n)-1 and (0) are consecutive and distance is simply
          distance around the ring.
</p>
<p>Each peer in the DHT is assigned a Peer-ID and is "responsible"
          for the nearby space of Resource-IDs. So, for instance, if we have a
          peer P, then it could also be responsible for storing data
          associated with Resource-ID P+epsilon as long as no other peer P was
          closer. The DHT Resource-ID space is divided so that some peer is
          responsible for each Resource-ID.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1.3"></a><h3>3.1.3.&nbsp;
Routing</h3>

<p>The way routing works in a DHT is specified by the specific DHT
          algorithm but the basic concepts are common to most systems. Each
          peer maintains connections to some other set of peers N. There need
          not be anything special about the peers in N, except that the peer
          has a direct connection to them: it can reach them without going
          through any other peer. When it wishes to deliver a message to some
          peer P, it selects some member of N, N_i that is closer to P than
          itself (as a degenerate case, P may be in N). The peer sends message
          to message to N_i. At this point two things can happen:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Recursive Routing</dt>
<dd>N_i repeats the same process as
              P, sending the message to one of its peers N_j. This same
              process repeats until the message is delivered to N.
</dd>
<dt>Iterative Routing</dt>
<dd>N_i consults its table of direct
              connections and selects a new peer N_j which is closer to N. It
              responds to the original sending peer with a redirect to N_j.
              The original peer then sends the message to N_j, where the
              process repeats until the sending peer is redirected to N.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>The advantage of iterative routing is that it consumes less
          resources for the intermediate peers; they only have to send
          redirect messages rather than forwarding requests and responses. The
          advantage of recursive routing is that it does not require the
          sending or receiving peer to have a rich set of connections to other
          nodes in the overlay. Thus, iterative routing is problematic in
          NATed networks because there is no way to guarantee that a peer will
          be able to form a connection to whatever peer it is redirected
          to.
</p>
<p>[[TODO: The details of which routing strategy are to be used and
          how they are selected are kind of unclear. This needs WG
          discussion.]]
</p>
<p>In most DHTs, the peers in N are selected in a particular way.
          One common strategy is to have them arranged exponentially further
          away from yourself so that any message can be routed in a O(log(N))
          steps. The details of the routing structure depend on the DHT
          algorithm, however, since it defines the distance metric and the
          structure of the connection table.
</p>
<p>In RELOAD, messages may either be REQUESTS or RESPONSES to
          REQUESTS. Requests are routed as described above. In principle,
          responses could be routed the same way. This is called "Asymmetric"
          routing because requests and responses will generally follow
          different paths through the network. Asymmetric routing makes
          diagnosis of errors difficult because you need to be able to acquire
          debugging information at multiple locations. In the alternative
          strategy, called "Symmetric" routing, as requests travel through the
          network they accumulate a history of the peers they passed through
          and responses are routed in the opposite direction so that they
          follow the same path in reverse. RELOAD supports both flavors of
          routing.
</p>
<p>Symmetric routing is easier to debug. Symmetric routing is also
          required when the overlay topology is changing. For example, when a
          new peer is joining the overlay, asymmetric routing cannot work
          because the response would not be able to reach the new peer until
          it has completed the joining process. Symmetric routing solves this
          situation because the response is routed from the admitting peer
          through the bootstrap peer, thus relying on a path that is already
          known and established. In order to implement symmetric routing,
          RELOAD provides the Via List (<a class='info' href='#sec-via-list'>Section&nbsp;3.2.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Via Lists</span><span>)</span></a>)
          feature. Asymmetric routing, however, requires no state to be stored
          in the message (as a Via List) or in on-path peers.
</p>
<p>[[TODO: again, this is a topic that needs WG discussion. It seems
          like there are situations where symmetric is very desirable (e.g.,
          startup). It's less clear that asymmetric will have a
          performance/state difference that will be significant.]]

<p>Each type-id is a code point assigned by IANA. Note that a

          allowed to contain multiple identical items while others may only

Joining, Leaving, and Maintenance</h3>

<p>When a new peer wishes to join the DHT, it must have a peer-id
          that it is allowed to use. It uses one of the peer-ids in the
          certificate it received from the enrollment server. The main steps
          in joining the DHT are:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Forming connections to some other peers.
</li>
<li>Acquiring the data values this peer is responsible for
              storing.
</li>
<li>Informing the other peers which were previously responsible
              for that data that this peer has taken over responsibility.
</li>
</ul>

<p>First, the peer ("JP," for Joining Peer) uses the bootstrap
          procedures to find some (any) peer in the DHT. It then typically
          contacts the peer which would have formerly been responsible for the
          peer's Resource-ID (since that is where in the DHT the peer will be
          joining), the Admitting Peer (AP). It copies the other peer's state,
          including the data values it is now responsible for and the
          identities of the peers with which the other peer has direct
          connections.
</p>
<p>The details of this operation depend mostly on the DHT involved,
          but a typical case would be:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>JP sends a JOIN request to AP announcing its intention to
              join.
</li>
<li>AP sends an OK response.
</li>
<li>AP does a sequence of STOREs to JP to give it the data it
              will need.
</li>
<li>AP does UPDATEs to JP and to other peers to tell it about its
              own routing table. At this point, both JP and AP consider JP
              responsible for some section of the DHT.
</li>
<li>JP makes its own connections to the appropriate peers in the
              DHT.
</li>
</ol>

<p>After this process is completed, JP is a full member of the DHT
          and can process STORE/FETCH requests.

Forming Direct Connections</h3>

<p>As described in <a class='info' href='#sec.routing'>Section&nbsp;3.1.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Routing</span><span>)</span></a>, a peer
          maintains a set of direct connections to other peers in the DHT.
          Consider the case of a peer JP just joining the DHT. It communicates
          with the admitting peer AP and gets the list of the peers in AP's
          routing table. Naively, it could simply connect to the IP address
          listed for each peer, but this works poorly if some of those peers
          are behind a NAT or firewall. Instead, we use the CONNECT request to
          establish a connection.
</p>
<p>Say that peer A wishes to form a direct connection to peer B. It
          gathers ICE candidates and packages them up in a CONNECT request
          which it sends to B through usual DHT routing procedures. B does its
          own candidate gathering and sends back an OK response with its
          candidates. A and B then do ICE connectivity checks on the candidate
          pairs. The result is a connection between A and B. At this point, A
          and B can add each other to their routing tables and send messages
          directly between themselves without going through other DHT
          peers.
</p>
<p>In general, a peer needs to maintain connections to all of the
          peers near it in the DHT and to enough other peers to have efficient
          routing (the details depend on the specific DHT). If a peer cannot
          form a connection to some other peer, this isn't necessarily a
          disaster; DHTs can route correctly even with not fully connected
          links. However, a peer should try to maintain the specified link set
          and if it detects that it has fewer direct connections, should form
          more as required.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2.2"></a><h3>3.2.2.&nbsp;
Via Lists</h3>

<p>In a general messaging system, messages need a source and a
          destination and peers need to be able to send a response to the peer
          that sent the request. This can be particularly tricky in overlay
          networks when a new peer is joining, or the overlay network is
          stabilizing and different peers have different ideas on what the
          overlay topology is. A simple and reliable way to make sure that a
          response can reach the node that sent the request in these
          situations is to have the response traverse the reverse path of the
          request.
</p>
<p>The approach used to do this is to have each node the request
          traverses add its peer-id to the "via list" in the request. Then the
          response is routed by looking at the list and using it as list of
          peers that the response will be routed thorough. To support this,
          each message has a route list of nodes it needs to be routed through
          as well as a via list of what nodes it has traversed.
</p>
<p>When a peer receives a message from the Transport Layer, it adds
          the peer-id of the node it received the message from to the end of
          the via list. When a peer goes to transmit a message to the
          Transport Layer, it looks at the first entry on the route list. If
          the entry is this peer, it removes this entry from the list and
          looks at the next entry and if the entry is not this peer, it sends
          the message to the first peer on the route list.
</p>
<p>When a peer goes to send a response to a request, it can simply
          copy the via list in reverse to form the route list for the response
          if it wishes to route the response along the reverse path as the
          request. [Discussion is need about if all responses are routed this
          way or not]
</p>
<p>Peers that are willing to maintain state may do list compression
          for privacy reason and to reduce the message size. They do this by
          taking some number of entries off the via list and replacing them
          with a unique entry that this peer can later identify. Later, if the
          peer sees the unique entry in a route list, it removes the unique
          entry and replaces it with the all the entries removed from the
          original via list (and reverses the order of these entries). Note
          that this technique will generally require storing some per-message
          state on the intermediate peer, so this is a bandwidth/per-peer
          state tradeoff. The exception is if the list is not compressed but
          rather the peer-ids are simply encrypted.
</p>
<p>The via list approach provides several features. First it allows
          a response to follow the same path as the request. This is
          particularly important for peers that are sending requests while
          they are joining and before other peers can route to them as well as
          situations where message are being exchanged to stabilize the
          overlay network. It also makes it easier to diagnose and manage the
          system when all peers see the response to any request they
          forward.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2.3"></a><h3>3.2.3.&nbsp;
Clients</h3>

<p>RELOAD also allows for the possibility of Client nodes. A client
          is a node which connects to an admitting peer (or peers) like an
          ordinary peer but never sends a JOIN or an UPDATE. It is therefore
          in the AP's connection table but not routing table and never is used
          to store any DHT data. However, because it is reachable through the
          AP, it can still send and receive messages. The client MUST still
          have the usual credentials.
</p>
<p>Because the client may only have a connection to a single AP,
          which, due to topology shifts may no longer be the responsible peer,
          clients SHOULD use symmetric routing and should advertise route
          lists that contain both the AP to which they are connected and
          themselves. E.g., if the client has peer-id X and the AP has peer-id
          Y, the client should advertise the route list (Y, X). This

Transport Layer</h3>

<p>This layer sends and receives messages over TLS and DTLS. For TLS
        it simply pushes the messages into the stream. For DTLS it takes care
        of fragmentation issues. The reason for including TLS is the improved
        performance it can offer for bulk transport of data. The reason for
        including DTLS is that the percentage of the time that two devices
        behind NATs can form a direct connection without a relay is much
        higher for DTLS than for TLS.

Enrollment</h3>

<p>Before a new user can join the DHT for the first time, they must
        enroll in the P2P Network for the DHT they want to join. Enrollment
        will typically be done by contacting a centralized enrollment server.
        Other approaches (for instance static out of band configuration) are
        possible but are outside the scope of this specification. During
        enrollment a new node learns about a particular overlay, sets up a
        names and credentials, and discovers the bootstrap nodes. This would
        typically be done when a new peer joined an overlay for the very first
        time. Bootstrap is the process that happens each time a node boots and
        is how the peer finds an node that can be used to join the
        overlay.
</p>
<p>Before a node can join an overlay, it needs to be provided with a
        name for the overlay. Some examples are "example.com", "example", and
        "example.local". An DNS SRV lookup is done on this name for the
        service name p2p_enroll and a proto of tcp. If the TLD for the name is
        .local, then this DNS SRV lookup is done using <a class='info' href='#I-D.cheshire-dnsext-multicastdns'>[I&#8209;D.cheshire&#8209;dnsext&#8209;multicastdns]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Cheshire, S. and M. Krochmal, &ldquo;Multicast DNS,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> and the service name
        p2p_menroll. The intention here is to support ad hoc/local overlays.
        The resulting DNS lookup will provide the address of a enrollment
        server. Once this server is found, HTTPS is used to retrieve a XML
        file that contains the parameters for the overlay. These include
        things such as: what algorithms the overlay uses, overlay parameters,
        what usages are a peer on this overlay is required to support, the
        type of credentials required, addresses of credentials servers, the
        root certificate for the DHT, information about the DHT algorithm that
        is being used, a P2P-Network-Id that uniquely identifies this ring,
        and any other parameters it may need to connect to the DHT. The DHT
        also informs the peers what Usages it is required to support to be a
        peer on this P2P Network. An initial list of bootstrap nodes that
        consist of multiple bootstrap entries that each have the IP address
        and port for contacting a bootstrap server. Some of the address may be
        multicast addresses. In the case of multicast DNS, every peer may also
        act as an enrollment server.

        being used, then the peer can proceed directly to bootstrap. If

        is being used, the peer MUST contact the credential server to obtain a

Certificate Issuance</h3>

<p>Once the peer has the XML file that identifies if credentials are
          needed, it can contact the credential server. The user establishes
          his identity to the server's satisfaction and provides the server
          with its public key. The centralized server then returns a
          certificate binding the user's user name to their public key. The
          properties of the certificate are discussed more in <a class='info' href='#sec-security-intro'>Section&nbsp;3.5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Security</span><span>)</span></a>. The amount of authentication
          performed here can vary radically depending on the DHT network being
          joined. Some networks may do no verification at all and some may
          require extensive identity verification. The only invariant that the
          enrollment server needs to ensure is that no two users may have the
          same identity.

Bootstrap</h3>

<p>The above steps are only done the first time a peer joins a new

          done every time the peer boots.
</p>
<p>Bootstrapping consists of looking at the list of cached nodes and
          bootstraps nodes and sending a RELOAD PING to them to see if they
          respond. Once a node responds, it can be used to join the overlay.
          After a node has joined, it keeps track of a small number of peers
          to which it could directly connect. Theses are saved as the cached
          nodes and used next time the peer boots. The point of the cached
          nodes is to reduce the load on the bootstrap nodes.

Certificate-Based Security</h3>

<p>The certificate-based security model revolves around the
          enrollment process allocating a unique name to the user and issuing
          a certificate <a class='info' href='#RFC3280'>[RFC3280]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Housley, R., Polk, W., Ford, W., and D. Solo, &ldquo;Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and           Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> for a public/private
          key pair for the user. All peers in a particular DHT can verify
          these certificates. A given peer acts on behalf of a user, and that
          user is somewhat responsible for its operation.
</p>
<p>The certificate serves two purposes:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>It entitles the user to store data at specific locations in
              the DHT.
</li>
<li>It entitles the user to operate a peer that has a peer-id
              found in the certificate. When the peer is acting as a DTLS or
              TLS server, it can use this certificate so that a client
              connecting to it knows it is connected to the correct
              server.
</li>
</ul>

<p>When a user enrolls, or enrolls a new device, the user is given a
          certificate. This certificate contains information that identifies
          the user and the device they are using. If a user has more than one
          device, typically they would get one certificate for each device.
          This allows each device to act as a separate peer.
</p>
<p>The contents of the certificate include:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>A public key provided by the user.
</li>
<li>Zero, one, or more user names that the DHT is allowing this
              user to use. For example, "alice@example.org". Typically a
              certificate will have one name. In the SIP usage, this name
              corresponds to the AOR.
</li>
<li>Zero, one, or more peer-ids. Typically there will be one
              peer-id. Each device will use a different peer-id, even if two
              devices belong to the same user. Peer-IDs should be chosen
              randomly by the enrollment server.
</li>
<li>A serial number that is unique to this certificate across all
              the certificates issued for this DHT.
</li>
<li>An expiration time for the certificate.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that because peer-IDs are chosen randomly, they will be
          randomly distributed with respect to the user name. This has the
          result that any given peer is highly unlikely to be responsible for
          storing data corresponding to its own user, which promotes high
          availability.

Storage Permissions</h3>

<p>When a peer uses a STORE request to place data at a particular
            location X, it must sign with the private key that corresponds to
            a certificate that is suitable for storing at location X. Each
            data type in a usage defines the exact rules for determining what
            certificate is appropriate. However, the most natural rule is that
            a certificate for a user name or peer-id X is a permission to
            store data at the same resource id that would be found by an
            attempt to look up X.
</p>
<p>The digital signature over the data serves two purposes. First,
            it allows the peer responsible for storing the data to verify that
            this STORE is authorized. Second, it provides integrity for the
            data. The signature is saved along with the data value (or values)
            so that any reader can verify the integrity of the data. Of
            course, the responsible peer can "lose" the value but it cannot
            undetectably modify it.

Peer Permissions</h3>

<p>The second purpose of a certificate is to allow the device to
            act as a peer with the specified peer-ID. When a peer wishes to
            connect to peer X, it forms a TLS/DTLS connection to the peer and
            then performs TLS mutual authentication and verifies that the
            presented certificate contains peer-ID X.
</p>
<p>Note that because the formation of a connection between two
            nodes generally requires traversing other nodes in the DHT, as
            specified in <a class='info' href='#direct.connect'>Section&nbsp;3.2.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Forming Direct Connections</span><span>)</span></a>, those nodes
            can interfere with connection initiation. However, if they attempt
            to impersonate the target peer they will be unable to complete the
            TLS mutual authentication: therefore such attacks can be
            detected.

          used. This is useful for admission control, but is completely unsafe

Migration</h3>

<p>At some point in time, a given P2P Network may want to migrate from
        one underlying DHT algorithm to another or update to a later extension
        of the protocol. This can also be used for crypto agility issues. The
        migration approach is done by basically having peers initializing
        algorithm A. When the clients go to periodically renew their
        credentials, they find out that the P2P Network now requires them to
        use algorithm A but also to store all the data with algorithm B. At
        this point there are effectively two DHT rings in use, rings A and B.
        All data is written to both but queries only go to A. At some point
        when the clients periodically renew their credentials, they learn that
        the P2P Network has moved to storing to both A and B but that FETCH
        requests are done with P2P Network B and that any SEND should first be
        attempted on P2P Network B and if that fails, retried on P2P Network
        A. In the final stage when clients renew credentials, they find out
        that P2P Network A is no longer required and only P2P Network B is in
        use. Some types of usages and environments may be able to migrate very
        quickly and do all of these steps in under a week, depending on how
        quickly software that supports both A and B is deployed and how often
        credentials are renewed. On the other hand, some very ad-hoc
        environments involving software from many different providers may take
        years to migrate.

Usages Layer</h3>

<p>By itself, the distributed storage layer just provides
        infrastructure on which applications are built. In order to do
        anything useful, a usage must be defined. Each Usage needs to specify
        several things:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Register code points for any type that the Usage defines.
</li>
<li>Define the data structure for each of the types.
</li>
<li>Define access control rules for each type.
</li>
<li>Provide a size limit for each type.
</li>
<li>Define how the seed is formed that is hashed to form the
            Resource-ID where each type is stored.
</li>
<li>Describe how values will be merged after a network partition.
            Unless otherwise specified, the default merging rule is to act as
            if all the values that need to be merged were stored and that the
            order they were stored in corresponds to the storing times
            associated with (and carried in) their values.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The types defined by a usage may also be applied to other usages.

SIP Usage</h3>

<p>From the perspective of P2PSIP, the most important usage is the
          SIP Usage. The basic function of the SIP usage is to allow Alice to
          start with a SIP URI (e.g., "bob@dht.example.com") and end up with a
          connection which Bob's SIP UA can use to pass SIP messages back and
          forth to Alice's SIP UA.
</p>
<p>This is done using three key operations that are provided by the
          SIP Usage. They are:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Mapping SIP URIs that are not GRUUs to other SIP URIs or to
              the DHT peer responsible for the SIP UA.
</li>
<li>Mapping SIP GRUUs to the DHT peer responsible for the SIP
              UA.
</li>
<li>Forming a connection directly to a DHT peer that is used to
              send SIP messages to the SIP UA.
</li>
</ul>

<p>All SIP URIs for a given overlay MUST be constructed so that they
          terminate in the domain name of the overlay. For instance, if the
          overlay name is "example.com", then all AORs must be of the form
          {sip,sips}:username@example.com. Accordingly, to dereference a URI,
          a P2PSIP implementation MUST check to see if the domain matches an
          overlay which it is a member of. If so, it uses the following
          procedures. Otherwise, it MUST follow <a class='info' href='#RFC3263'>[RFC3263]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J. and H. Schulzrinne, &ldquo;Session Initiation Protocol (SIP): Locating SIP           Servers,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>
          procedures. Note that unless the P2PSIP overlay provides some kind
          of SIP gateway, this is likely to be only partially successful,
          since, for instance, the callee may not be able to call back.

SIP Location</h3>

<p>A peer acting as a SIP UA stores their registration information
            in the DHT by storing either another URI (for retargeting) or a
            route lists to reach them at a Resource-ID in the DHT formed from
            the user's SIP AOR. When another peer wishes to find a peer that
            is registered for a SIP URI, the lookup of the user's name is done
            by taking the user's SIP Address or Record (AOR) and using it as
            the seed that is hashed to get a Resource-ID. When the seed is
            dereferenced, the result is a set of values. Each value is either
            another SIP URI or a route list. If the value is a SIP URI, the
            calling peer looks up that URI and continues the process until he
            gets a route list.
</p>
<p>If the value is a route list, then it is used to reach a peer
            that represents a SIP UA registered for that AOR. Typically this
            route list will have just one entry but in the case of peers or
            clients that can not be directly reached, a route list with more
            than one entry may need to be used.
</p>
<p>The seed for this usage is a user's SIP AOR, such as
            "sip:alice@example.com". This allows the set to store many values
            but only one for each peer. The authorization policy is that STORE
            requests are only allowed if the user name in the signing
            certificate, when turned into a SIP URL and hashed, matches the
            Resource-ID. This policy ensures that only a user with the
            certificate with the user name "alice@example.com" can write to
            the Resource-ID that will be used to look up calls to
            "sip:alice@example.com".
</p>
<p>Open Issue: Should the seed be "sip:alice@example.com",
            "alice@example.com", or a string that includes the code point
            defined for the type? The issue here is determining whether
            different usages that store data at a seed that is primarily
            formed from "alice@example.com" should hash to the same
            Resource-ID as the SIP Usage. For example, if a buddy list had a
            seed that was roughly the same, would we want the buddy list
            information to end up on the same peers that stored the SIP
            location data or on different peers?

            up a direct connection using CONNECT. This allows a SIP message to
            be sent immediately, without the delay associated with CONNECT and
            for a simple SIP exchange, it may result in fewer messages being
            sent.

Certificate Store Usage</h3>

<p>This usage allows each user to store their certificate in the DHT
          so that it can be retrieved to be checked by various peers and
          applications. Peers acting on behalf of a particular user store that
          user's certificate in the DHT, and any peer that needs the
          certificate can do a FETCH to retrieve the certificate. Typically it
          is retrieved to check a signature on a request or the signature on a
          chunk of data that the DHT has received.

<p>This usage defines a new type for finding STUN-Relay servers. Any

          TURN server, it picks a random Resource-ID and performs a FIND at
          that Resource-ID for the appropriate type for the service. If
          nothing is found, this can be repeated until an appropriate set of
          servers are found.

Base Protocol</h3>

<p>RELOAD is a message-oriented request/response protocol. The messages
      are encoded using binary fields. All integers are represented in network
      byte order. The general philosophy behind the design was to use Type,
      Length, Value fields to allow for extensibility. However, for the parts
      of a structure that were required in all messages, just define theses in
      a fixed position as adding a type and length for them is unnecessary and
      would simply increases bandwidth and introduces new potentials for
      interoperability issues.
</p>
<p>Each message has three parts:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Forwarding Header:</dt>
<dd>Each message has a generic header
          which is used to forward the message between peers and to its final
          destination. This header is the only information that an
          intermediate peer (i.e., one that is not the target of a message)
          needs to examine.
</dd>
<dt>Message Contents:</dt>
<dd>The message being delivered between
          the peers. From the perspective of the forwarding layer, the
          contents is opaque, however, it is interpreted by the higher
          layers.
</dd>
<dt>Signature:</dt>
<dd>A digital signature over the message
          contents and parts of the header of the message. Note that this
          signature can be computed without parsing the message contents.

<p>The first four bytes identify this message as a RELOAD message.

<p>The Overlay field is the 32bit checksum/hash of the overlay being
        used. The CRC-32 checksum MUST be used to convert the variable length
        string representing the overlay name into a 32bit value. The purpose
        of this field is to allow nodes to participate in multiple overlays
        and to detect accidental misconfiguration.
</p>
<p>TTL (time-to-live) is an 8 bit field indicating the number of
        iterations, or hops, a message can experience before it is discarded.
        The TTL u_int8 number MUST be stored in network byte order and MUST be
        decremented by one at every hop along the route the message traverses.
        If the TTL is 0, the message MUST NOT be propagated further and MUST
        be discarded. The initial value of the TTL should be TBD.
</p>
<p>Routing is an 8 bit field that specifies the type of routing the
        requester would like for the message. The following Routing options

</p>
<p>EXP is a 1 bit field that specifies if this protocol is
        experimental or not. The EXP bit can be set to denote that this

Request Origination</h3>

<p>In order to send a message to a given peer-id or resource-id, a
            peer must construct an appropriate route list. The most common
            such route list is a single entry containing the peer/resource-id.
            This simply uses the normal DHT routing mechanisms to forward the
            message to that destination.
</p>
<p>Messages can also be source routed. In order to construct a
            source route, the originator provides a route list containing a
            sequence of resource-ids. The semantics of this route list are
            that the message is to traverse in order (potentially with
            intermediate hops) each entry on the route list. As each peer is
            traversed, that entry is removed from the route list. This makes
            it possible to address a peer which is potentially behind a NAT or
            a firewall in such a way that it cannot be connected to directly
            under any circumstances.

Response Origination</h3>

<p>When a peer sends a response to a request, it SHOULD construct
            the route list by reversing the order of the entries on the via
            list. This has the result that the response traverses (at least)
            the same peers as the request traversed, except in reverse order
            (symmetric routing). For asymmetric routing, the peer MAY simply
            use the first entry on the via list.

Message Receipt and Forwarding</h3>

<p>When a peer receives a message, it first examines the overlay,
            version, and other header fields to determine whether the message
            is one it can process. If any of these are incorrect (e.g., the
            message is for an overlay in which the peer does not participate)
            it is an error. The peer SHOULD generate an appropriate error but
            MAY simply drop the message.
</p>
<p>Once the peer has determined that the message is correctly
            formatted, it examines the first entry on the route list. There
            are three possible cases here:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The first entry on the route list is a private id which is
                being used for route list compression.
</li>
<li>The first entry on the route list is an id for which the
                peer is responsible.
</li>
<li>The first entry on the route list is for which another peer
                is responsible.

<p>If the first entry on the route list is a private id, the

              indexes and then re-examines the route list to determine which

              list. If there are remaining entries on the route list, the peer
              then re-examines the route list to determine which case now
              applies. If the route list is now empty, then the message was
              destined for this peer and it MUST pass it to the next layer
              up.

Other ID</h3>

<p>If neither of the other two cases applies, then the peer MUST
              forward the message towards the first entry on the route list.
              This means that it MUST select one of the peers in its route
              table which is closer to the first entry than to itself and send
              the message to that peer. If the first entry on the route list
              is in the peer's connection table, then it SHOULD forward the
              message to that peer directly.
</p>
<p>When forwarding a message, the peer MUST:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Decrement the TTL value
</li>
<li>Update the via list.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The natural way to update the via list is simply to add the
              peer-id of the peer from which the message was received to the
              end of the list. However, peers may use any algorithm of their
              choice provided that if the peer received a route list
              constructed by reversing the via list it would be able to route
              the outgoing message correctly, enabling symmetric routing.
</p>
<p>For instance, if node D receives a message from node C with
              via list (A, B), the simple approach is simply to forward to the
              next node (E) with via list (A, B, C). Now, if E wants to
              respond to the message, it reverses the via list to produce the
              route list, resulting in (D, C, B, A). When D forwards the
              response to C, the route list will contain (B, A). However, node
              D could also list compression and send E the via list (X). E
              would then use the route list (D, X). When D processes this
              route list, it MUST detect that X is a compressed entry, recover
              the via list (A, B, C), and reverse that to produce the correct
              route list (C, B, A) before sending it to C.
</p>
<p>Note that if a peer is using list compression and then exits
              the overlay, the message cannot be forwarded and will be
              dropped. The ordinary timeout and retransmission networks
              provide stability over this type of failure.

Fragmentation and Reassembly</h3>

<p>In order to allow transport over datagram protocols, RELOAD
          messages may be fragmented. If a message is too large for a peer to
          transmit to the next peer it MUST fragment the message. Note that
          this implies that intermediate peers may re-fragment messages if the
          incoming and outgoing paths have different maximum datagram sizes.
          Intermediate peers SHOULD NOT reassemble fragments.
</p>
<p>Upon receipt of a fragmented message by the intended peer, the
          peer holds the fragments in a holding buffer until the entire
          message has been received. The message is then reassembled into a
          single unfragmented message and processed. In order to prevent
          denial of service attacks, receivers SHOULD time out incomplete
          fragments. [[TODO: Describe algorithm]]

CONNECT</h3>

<p>A node sends a CONNECT request when it wishes to establish a
          direct TCP or UDP connection to another node for the purposes of
          sending RELOAD messages or application layer protocol messages, such
          as SIP. Detailed procedures for the CONNECT and its response are
          described in <a class='info' href='#sec-connect-ice'>Section&nbsp;6<span> (</span><span class='info'>ICE and Connection Formation</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<h3>Note</h3>

<p>A CONNECT does not result in updating the routing table of
            either node. That function is performed by UPDATEs. If node A has
            CONNECTed to node B, it MAY route messages which are directly
            addressed to B through that channel but MUST NOT route messages
            through B to other peers via that channel.

<a name="rfc.section.5.1.3"></a><h3>5.1.3.&nbsp;
TUNNEL</h3>

<p>A node sends a TUNNEL request when it wishes to exchange
          application-layer protocol messages without the expense of
          establishing a direct connection via CONNECT or when ICE is unable
          to establish a direct connection via CONNECT and a TURN relay is not
          available. The application-level protocols that are routed via the
          TUNNEL request are defined by that application's usage.
</p>
<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The decision of whether to route application-level traffic
            across the overlay or to open a direct connection requires careful
            consideration of the overhead involved in each transaction.
            Establishing a direct connection requires greater initial setup
            costs, but after setup, communication is faster and imposes no
            overhead on the overlay. For example, for the SIP usage, an INVITE
            to establish a voice call might be routed over the overlay, a
            SUBSCRIBE with regular updates would be better used with a
            CONNECT, and media would both impose too great a load on the
            overlay and likely receive unacceptable performance. However,
            there may be a tradeoff between locating TURN servers and relying
            on TUNNEL for packet routing.
</p>
<p>When a usage requires the TUNNEL method, it must specify the
          specific application protocol(s) that will be TUNNELed and for each
          protocol, specify: </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>An application attribute that indicates the protocol being
              tunneled. This the IANA-registered port of the application
              protocol.
</li>
<li>The conditions under which the application will be TUNNELed
              over the overlay rather than using a direct CONNECT.
</li>
<li>A mechanism for moving future application-level communication
              from TUNNELing on the overlay to a direct CONNECTion, or an
              explanation why this is unnecessary.
</li>
<li>A means of associating messages together as required for
              dialog-oriented or request/response-oriented protocols.
</li>
<li>How the TUNNELed message (and associated responses) will be
              delivered to the correct application. This is particularly
              important if there might be multiple instances of the
              application on or behind a single peer.

<p>As with STORE, the fetch request contains a list of type-ids
            and associated references. The reference encoding depends on the
            type of value being stored.
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>If the data is of type single value, the reference is
              empty.

<li>If the data is of type array, the reference contains two
              integers. The first integer is the beginning of the range and
              the second is the end of the range. 0 is used to indicate the
              first element and -1 is used to indicate the final element. The
              beginning of the range MUST be earlier in the array then the
              end.
</li>
<li>If the data is of type dictionary then the reference contains
              a list of the dictionary keys being requested. If no keys are

              should be returned.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The generation-counter is used to indicate the requester's
            expected state of the storing peer. If the generation-counter in
            the request matches the stored counter, then the storing peer
            returns a cache hit indicator rather than the stored data.
</p>
<p>Note that because the certificate for a user is typically
            stored at the same location as any data stored for that user, a
            requesting peer which does not already have the user's certificate
            should request the certificate in the FETCH as an

REMOVE</h3>

<p>The REMOVE request is used to remove a stored element or elements
          from the storing peer. Although each type-id defines its own access
          control requirements, in general only the original signer of the
          data should be allowed to remove it. Any successful remove of an
          existing element for a given type-id MUST increment the generation
          counter by at least one.
</p>
<p>A remove-request has exactly the same syntax as a FETCH request
          except that each entry represents a set of values to be removed
          rather than returned. The same type-id MUST NOT be used twice in a
          given remove-request. Each fetch-type-data is then processed in
          turn. These operations MUST be atomic. If any operation fails, the
          state MUST be rolled back to before the request was received.
</p>
<p>Before processing the REMOVE request, the peer MUST perform the
          following checks.
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The type-id is known.
</li>
<li>The signature over the message is valid or (depending on
              overlay policy) no signature is required.
</li>
<li>The signer of the message has permissions which permit him to
              remove this type of data.
</li>
<li>If the generation-counter is non-zero, it must equal the
              current value of the generation-counter for this type. This
              feature allows the generation counter to be used in a way
              similar to the HTTP Etag feature.

ICE and Connection Formation</h3>

<p>At numerous times during the operation of RELOAD, a node will need to
      establish a connection to another node. This may be for the purposes of
      building finger tables when the node joins the P2P network, or when the
      node learns of a new neighbor through an UPDATE and needs to establish a
      connection to that neighbor.
</p>
<p>In addition, a node may need to connect to another node for the
      purposes of an application connection. In the case of SIP, when a node
      has looked up the target AOR in the DHT, it will obtain a Node-ID that
      identifies that peer. The next step will be to establish a "direct"
      connection for the purposes of performing SIP signaling.
</p>
<p>In both of these cases, the node starts with a destination Node-ID,
      and its objective is to create a connection (ideally using TCP, but
      falling back to UDP when it is not available) to the node with that
      given Node-ID. The establishment of this connection is done using the
      CONNECT request in conjunction with ICE. It is assumed that the reader
      has familiarity with ICE.
</p>
<p>RELOAD implementations MUST implement full ICE. Because RELOAD always
      tries to use TCP and then UDP as a fallback, there will be multiple
      candidates of the same IP version, which requires full ICE.

<a name="rfc.section.6.1"></a><h3>6.1.&nbsp;
Overview</h3>

<p>To utilize ICE, the CONNECT method provides a basic offer/answer
        operation that exchanges a set of candidates for a single "stream". In
        this case, the "stream" refers not to RTP or other types of media, but
        rather to a connection for RELOAD itself or for SIP signaling. The
        CONNECT request contains the candidates for this stream, and the
        CONNECT response contains the corresponding answer with candidates for
        that stream. Though CONNECT provides an offer/answer exchange, it does
        not actually carry or utilize Session Description Protocol (SDP)
        messages. Rather, it carries the raw ICE parameters required for ICE
        operation, and the ICE spec is utilized as if these parameters had
        actually been used in an SDP offer or answer. In essence, ICE is
        utilized by mapping the CONNECT parameters into an SDP for the
        purposes of following the details of ICE itself. That avoids the need
        for RELOAD to respecify ICE, yet allows it to operate without the
        baggage that SDP would bring.
</p>
<p>In addition, RELOAD only allows for a single offer/answer exchange.
        Unlike the usage of ICE within SIP, there is never a need to send a
        subsequent offer to update the default candidates to match the ones
        selected by ICE.
</p>
<p>RELOAD and SIP always run over TLS for TCP connections and DTLS
        <a class='info' href='#RFC4347'>[RFC4347]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rescorla, E. and N. Modadugu, &ldquo;Datagram Transport Layer Security,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> for UDP "connections". Consequently,
        once ICE processing has completed, both agents will begin TLS and DTLS
        procedures to establish a secure link. Its important to note that, had
        a TURN server been utilized for the TCP or UDP stream, the TURN server
        will transparently relay the TLS messaging and the encrypted TLS
        content, and thus will not have access to the contents of the
        connection once it is established. Any attack by the TURN server to
        insert itself as a man-in-the-middle are thwarted by the usage of the
        fingerprint mechanism of RFC 4572 <a class='info' href='#RFC4572'>[RFC4572]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Lennox, J., &ldquo;Connection-Oriented Media Transport over the Transport Layer           Security (TLS) Protocol in the Session Description Protocol           (SDP),&rdquo; July&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>,
        which will reveal that the TLS and DTLS certificates are not a match

Collecting STUN Servers</h3>

<p>ICE relies on the node having one or more STUN servers to use. In
        conventional ICE, it is assumed that nodes are configured with one or
        more STUN servers through some out-of-band mechanism. This is still
        possible in RELOAD but RELOAD also learns STUN servers as it connects
        to other peers. Because all RELOAD peers implement ICE and use STUN
        keepalives, every peer is a STUN server<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-behave-rfc3489bis'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;behave&#8209;rfc3489bis]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;Session Traversal Utilities for (NAT) (STUN),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. Accordingly, any peer you
        know about will be willing to be a STUN server for you -- though of
        course it may be behind a NAT.
</p>
<p>A peer on a well-provisioned wide-area overlay will be configured
        with one or more bootstrap peers. These peers make an initial list of
        STUN servers. However, as the peer forms connections with additional
        peers, it builds more peers it can use as STUN servers.
</p>
<p>Because complicated NAT topologies are possible, a peer may need
        more than one STUN server. Specifically, a peer that is behind a
        single NAT will typically observe only two IP addresses in its STUN
        checks: its local address and its server reflexive address from a STUN
        server outside its NAT. However, if there are more NATs involved, it
        may discover that it learns additional server reflexive addresses
        (which vary based on where in the topology the STUN server is). To
        maximize the chance of achieving a direct connection, A peer SHOULD
        group other peers by the peer-reflexive addresses it discovers through
        them. It SHOULD then select one peer from each group to use as a STUN
        server for future connections.
</p>
<p>Only peers to which the peer currently has connections may be used.
        If the connection to that host is lost, it MUST be removed from the
        list of stun servers and a new server from the same group SHOULD be
        selected.
</p>
<p>OPEN ISSUE: should the peer try to keep at least one peer in each
        group, even if it has no other reason for the connection? Need to
        specify when to stop adding new groups if the peer is behind a really
        bad NAT.
</p>
<p>OPEN ISSUE: RELOAD-01 had a Peer-Info structure that allowed peers
        to exchange information such as a "default" IP-port pair in UPDATEs.
        This structure could be expanded to include the candidate list for a
        peer, thus allowing ICE negotiation to begin or even direct
        communication before a CONNECT request has been received. (The
        candidate pairs for the P2P port are fixed because the same source
        port is used for all connections.) However, because this would require
        significant changes to the ICE algorithm, we have not introduced such
        an extension at this point.

Gathering Candidates</h3>

<p>When a node wishes to establish a connection for the purposes of
        RELOAD signaling or SIP signaling (or any other application protocol
        for that matter), it follows the process of gathering candidates as
        described in Section 4 of ICE <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;mmusic&#8209;ice]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for           Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer           Protocols,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. RELOAD utilizes a single
        component, as does SIP. Consequently, gathering for these "streams"
        requires a single component.
</p>
<p>An agent MUST implement ICE-tcp <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;mmusic&#8209;ice]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for           Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer           Protocols,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>, and MUST gather at least one UDP
        and one TCP host candidate for RELOAD and for SIP.
</p>
<p>The ICE specification assumes that an ICE agent is configured with,
        or somehow knows of, TURN and STUN servers. RELOAD provides a way for
        an agent to learn these by querying the ring, as described in <a class='info' href='#sec-collect'>Section&nbsp;6.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Collecting STUN Servers</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#sec-stun-turn-usage'>Section&nbsp;9.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>TURN Usage</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>The agent SHOULD prioritize its TCP-based candidates over its
        UDP-based candidates in the prioritization described in Section 4.1.2
        of ICE <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;mmusic&#8209;ice]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for           Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer           Protocols,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>The default candidate selection described in Section 4.1.3 of ICE
        is ignored; defaults are not signaled or utilized by RELOAD.

<a name="rfc.section.6.4"></a><h3>6.4.&nbsp;
Encoding the CONNECT Message</h3>

<p>Section 4.3 of ICE describes procedures for encoding the SDP.
        Instead of actually encoding an SDP, the candidate information (IP
        address and port and transport protocol, priority, foundation,
        component ID, type and related address) is carried within the
        attributes of the CONNECT request or its response. Similarly, the
        username fragment and password are carried in the CONNECT message or
        its response. <a class='info' href='#sec-connect-details'>Section&nbsp;5.1.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>CONNECT</span><span>)</span></a> describes the
        detailed attribute encoding for CONNECT. The CONNECT request and its
        response do not contain any default candidates or the ice-lite
        attribute, as these features of ICE are not used by RELOAD. The
        CONNECT request and its response also contain a Next-Protocol
        attribute, with a value of SIP or RELOAD, which indicates what
        protocol is to be run over the connection. The RELOAD CONNECT request
        MUST only be utilized to set up connections for application protocols
        that can be multiplexed with STUN and RELOAD itself.
</p>
<p>Since the CONNECT request contains the candidate information and
        short term credentials, it is considered as an offer for a single
        media stream that happens to be encoded in a format different than
        SDP, but is otherwise considered a valid offer for the purposes of
        following the ICE specification. Similarly, the CONNECT response is
        considered a valid answer for the purposes of following the ICE
        specification.
</p>
<p>Since all messages with RELOAD are secured between nodes, the node
        MUST implement the fingerprint attribute of RFC 4572 <a class='info' href='#RFC4572'>[RFC4572]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Lennox, J., &ldquo;Connection-Oriented Media Transport over the Transport Layer           Security (TLS) Protocol in the Session Description Protocol           (SDP),&rdquo; July&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>, and encode it into the CONNECT request and
        response as described in <a class='info' href='#sec-connect-details'>Section&nbsp;5.1.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>CONNECT</span><span>)</span></a>.
        This fingerprint will be matched with the certificates utilized to
        authenticate the RELOAD CONNECT request and its response.
</p>
<p>Similarly, the node MUST implement the active, passive, and actpass
        attributes from RFC 4145 <a class='info' href='#RFC4145'>[RFC4145]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Yon, D. and G. Camarillo, &ldquo;TCP-Based Media Transport in the Session Description Protocol           (SDP),&rdquo; September&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>. However, here
        they refer strictly to the role of active or passive for the purposes
        of TLS handshaking. The TCP connection directions are signaled as part
        of the ICE candidate attribute.

Verifying ICE Support</h3>

Role Determination</h3>

<p>The roles of controlling and controlled as described in Section 5.2

        the answerer (the entity sending the CONNECT response) will always be
        controlled. The connectivity checks MUST still contain the
        ICE-CONTROLLED and ICE-CONTROLLING attributes, however, even though
        the role reversal capability for which they are defined will never be
        needed with RELOAD. This is to allow for a common codebase between ICE
        for RELOAD and ICE for SDP.

Concluding ICE</h3>

<p>The controlling agent MUST utilize regular nomination. This is to

        for an updated offer, as RELOAD does not generate additional
        offer/answer exchanges.

<p>The procedures in Section 8 of ICE are followed to conclude ICE,
        with the following exceptions:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The controlling agent MUST NOT attempt to send an updated offer
            once the state of its single media stream reaches Completed.
</li>
<li>Once the state of ICE reaches Completed, the agent can
            immediately free all unused candidates. This is because RELOAD
            does not have the concept of forking, and thus the three second
            delay in Section 8.3 of ICE does not apply.

Sending Media</h3>

<p>The procedures of Section 11 apply to RELOAD as well. However, in
        this case, the "media" takes the form of application layer protocols
        (RELOAD or SIP for example) over TLS or DTLS. Consequently, once ICE
        processing completes, the agent will begin TLS or DTLS procedures to
        establish a secure connection. The fingerprint from the CONNECT
        request and its response are used as described in RFC 4572 <a class='info' href='#RFC4572'>[RFC4572]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Lennox, J., &ldquo;Connection-Oriented Media Transport over the Transport Layer           Security (TLS) Protocol in the Session Description Protocol           (SDP),&rdquo; July&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>, to ensure that another node in the P2P

Chord Algorithm </h3>

</p>
<p>This algorithm is assigned the name chord-128-2-8 to indicate it is

<a name="rfc.section.7.1"></a><h3>7.1.&nbsp;
Overview</h3>

<p>The algorithm described here is a modified version of the Chord
        algorithm. Each peer keeps track of a finger table of 8 entries and a
        neighborhood table of 6 entries. The neighborhood table contains the 3
        peers before this peer and the 3 peers after it in the DHT ring. The
        first entry in the finger table contains the peer half-way around the
        ring from this peer; the second entry contains the peer that is 1/4 of
        the way around; the third entry contains the peer that is 1/8th of the
        way around, and so on. Fundamentally, the chord data structure can be
        thought of a doubly-linked list formed by knowing the successors and
        predecessor peers in the neighborhood table, sorted by the peer-id. As
        long as the successor peers are correct, the DHT will return the
        correct result. The pointers to the prior peers are kept to enable
        inserting of new peers into the list structure. Keeping multiple
        predecessor and successor pointers makes it possible to maintain the
        integrity of the data structure even when consecutive peers
        simultaneously fail. The finger table forms a skip list, so that
        entries in the linked list can rapidly be found - it needs to be there
        so that peers can be found in O(log(N)) time instead of the typical
        O(N) time that a linked list would provide.
</p>
<p>A peer, n, is responsible for a particular Resource-ID k if k is
        less than or equal to n and k is greater than p, where p is the peer
        id of the previous peer in the neighborhood table. Care must be taken
        when computing to note that all math is modulo 2^128.

Routing</h3>

<p>If a peer is not responsible for a Resource-ID k, then it routes a
        request to that location by routing it to the peer in either the
        neighborhood or finger table that has the largest peer-id that is
        still less than or equal to k.

Redundancy </h3>

<p>When a peer receives a STORE request for Resource-ID k, and it is
        responsible for Resource-ID k, it stores the data and returns a
        SUCCESS response. [[Open Issue: should it delay sending this SUCCESS
        until it has successfully stored the redundant copies?]]. It then
        sends a STORE request to its successor in the neighborhood table and
        to that peers successor. Note that these STORE requests are addressed
        to those specific peers, even though the Resource-ID they are being
        asked to store is outside the range that they are responsible for. The
        peers receiving these check they came from an appropriate predecessor
        in their neighborhood table and that they are in a range that this
        predecessor is responsible for, and then they store the data.
</p>
<h3>Note: </h3>

<p>This redundancy algorithm breaks if the storing node is malicious
          and does not store the data in the replica set. Applications which
          wish to have defenses against that must explicitly store multiple
          copies of the data with separate peers. [[OPEN ISSUE: Where should a
          replication algorithm of this type be described? The DHT? The

Joining</h3>

<p>The join process for a joining party (JP) with peer-id n is as
        follows.
</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>JP connects to its chosen bootstrap node.
</li>
<li>JP uses a series of PINGs to populate its routing table.
</li>
<li>JP sends CONNECT requests to initiate connections to each of the
          peers in the connection table as well as to the desired finger table
          entries. Note that this does not populate their routing tables, but
          only their connection tables, so JP will not get messages that it is
          expected to route to other nodes.
</li>
<li>JP enters all the peers it contacted into its routing table.
</li>
<li>JP sends a JOIN to its immediate successor, the admitting peer
          (AP) for peer-id n. The AP sends the response to the JOIN.
</li>
<li>AP does a series of STORE requests to JP to store the data that
          JP will be responsible for.
</li>
<li>AP sends JP an UPDATE explicitly labelling JP as its predecessor.
          At this point, JP is part of the ring and responsible for a section
          of the overlay. AP can now forget any data which is assigned to JP
          and not AP.
</li>
<li>AP sends an UPDATE to all of its neighbors with the new values of
          its neighbor set (including JP).
</li>
<li>JP sends UPDATES to all the peers in its routing table.
</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to populate its routing table, JP sends a PING via the
        bootstrap node directed at resource-id n+1 (directly after its own
        resource-id). This allows it to discover its own successor. Call that
        node p0. It then sends a ping to p0+1 to discover its successor (p1).
        This process can be repeated to discover as many successors as
        desired. The values for the two peers before p will be found at a

Sending UPDATEs</h3>

<p>Every time a connection to a peer in the neighborhood set is lost
          (as determined by connectivity pings), the peer should remove the
          entry from its neighborhood table and send an UPDATE to all the
          remaining neighbors. The update will contain all the peer-ids of the
          current entries of the table (after the failed one has been

          If connectivity is lost to all the peers in the finger table, this
          peer should assume that it has been disconnected from the rest of
          the network, and it should periodically try to join the DHT.

<a name="rfc.section.7.5.2"></a><h3>7.5.2.&nbsp;
Receiving UPDATEs</h3>

<p>When a peer, N, receives an UPDATE request, it examines the
          peer-ids in the UPDATE and at its neighborhood table and decides if
          this UPDATE would change its neighborhood table. This is done by
          taking the set of peers currently in the neighborhood table and
          comparing them to the peers in the update request. There are three
          major cases:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The UPDATE contains peers that would not change the neighbor
            set because they match the neighborhood table.
</li>
<li>The UPDATE contains peers closer to N than those in its
            neighborhood table.
</li>
<li>The UPDATE defines peers that indicate a neighborhood table
            further away from N than some of its neighborhood table. Note that
            merely receiving peers further away does not demonstrate this,
            since the update could be from a node far away from N. Rather, the
            peers would need to bracket N.
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the first case, no change is needed.
</p>
<p>In the second case, N MUST attempt to CONNECT to the new peers
          and if it is successful it MUST adjust its neighbor set accordingly.
          Note that it can maintain the now inferior peers as neighbors, but
          it MUST remember the closer ones.
</p>
<p>The third case implies that a neighbor has disappeared, most
          likely because it has simply been disconnected but perhaps because
          of overlay instability. N MUST PING the questionable peers to
          discover if they are indeed missing and if so, remove them from its
          neighborhood table.
</p>
<p>After any PINGs and CONNECTs are done, if the neighborhood table
          changes, the peer sends an UPDATE request to each of its neighbors
          that was in either the old table or the new table. These UPDATEs are
          what ends up filling in the predecessor/successor tables of peers
          that this peer is a neighbor to. A peer MUST NOT enter itself in
          its successor or predecessor table and instead should leave the
          entries empty.
</p>
<p>A peer N which is responsible for a resource-id R discovers that
          the replica set for R (the next two nodes in its successor set) has
          changed, it MUST send a STORE for any data associated with R to any
          new node in the replica set. It SHOULD not delete data from peers
          which have left the replica set.
</p>
<p>When a peer N detects that it is no longer in the replica set for
          a resource R (i.e., there are three predecessors between N and R),
          it SHOULD delete all data associated with R from its local
          store.

<a name="rfc.section.7.5.3"></a><h3>7.5.3.&nbsp;
Stabilization</h3>

<p>A peer MUST periodically send an UPDATE to every peer in its
          routing table. The purpose of this is to keep the predecessor and
          successor lists up to date and to detect connection failures. The
          default time is about every ten minutes, but the enrollment server
          SHOULD set this in the configuration document using the
          "chord-128-2-8-update-frequency" element (denominated in seconds.) A
          peer SHOULD randomly offset these UPDATEs so they do not occur all
          at once. If an UPDATE fails or times out, the peer MUST mark that
          entry in the neighbor table invalid and attempt to reestablish a
          connection. If no connection can be established, the peer MUST
          attempt to establish a new peer as its neighbor and do whatever
          replica set adjustments are required.
</p>
<p>Periodically a peer should select a random entry i from the
          finger table and do a PING to peer (n+2^(numBitsInPeerId-i). The
          purpose of this is to find a more accurate finger table entry if
          there is one. This is done less frequently than the connectivity
          checks in the previous section because forming new connections is
          somewhat expensive and the cost needs to be balanced against the
          cost of not having the most optimal finger table entries. The
          default time is about every hour, but the enrollment server SHOULD
          set this in the configuration document using the
          "chord-128-2-8-ping-frequency" element (denominated in seconds). If
          this returns a different peer than the one currently in this entry
          of the peer table, then a new connection should be formed to this
          peer and it should replace the old peer in the finger table.

<a name="rfc.section.8.1"></a><h3>8.1.&nbsp;
Discovery</h3>

<p>When a peer first joins a new overlay, it starts with a discovery
        process to find an enrollment server. Related work to the approach
        used here is described in <a class='info' href='#I-D.garcia-p2psip-dns-sd-bootstrapping'>[I&#8209;D.garcia&#8209;p2psip&#8209;dns&#8209;sd&#8209;bootstrapping]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Garcia, G., &ldquo;P2PSIP bootstrapping using DNS-SD,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#I-D.matthews-p2psip-bootstrap-mechanisms'>[I&#8209;D.matthews&#8209;p2psip&#8209;bootstrap&#8209;mechanisms]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Cooper, E., &ldquo;Bootstrap Mechanisms for P2PSIP,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. The peer
        first determines the overlay name. This value is provided by the user
        or some other out of band provisioning mechanism. If the name is an IP
        address, that is directly used otherwise the peer MUST do a DNS SRV
        query using a Service name of "p2p_enroll" and a proto of tcp to find
        an enrollment server.
</p>
<p>If the overlay name ends in .local, then the DNS SRV lookup is done
        using implement <a class='info' href='#I-D.cheshire-dnsext-dns-sd'>[I&#8209;D.cheshire&#8209;dnsext&#8209;dns&#8209;sd]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Krochmal, M. and S. Cheshire, &ldquo;DNS-Based Service Discovery,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> with
        a Service name of "p2p_menroll" can also be tried to find an
        enrollment server. If they implement this, the user name can be used
        as the Instance Identifier label.
</p>
<p>Once an address for the enrollment servers is determined, the peer
        forms an HTTPS connection to that IP address. The certificate MUST
        match the overlay name as described in <a class='info' href='#RFC2818'>[RFC2818]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rescorla, E., &ldquo;HTTP Over TLS,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>.
        The peer then performs a GET to the URL formed by appending a path of
        "/p2psip/enroll" to the overlay name. For example, if the overlay name
        was example.com, the URL would be
        "https://example.com/p2psip/enroll".

        server to acquire them.
</p>
<p>In order to acquire credentials, the peer generates an asymmetric
        key pair and then generates a "Simple Enrollment Request" (as defined
        in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-pkix-2797-bis'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;pkix&#8209;2797&#8209;bis]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Myers, M. and J. Schaad, &ldquo;Certificate Management Messages over CMS,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>) and sends this over

        the URL in the credential-server element. The subjectAltName in the

Locating a Peer</h3>

<p>In order to join the overlay, the peer MUST contact a bootstrap
        peer. If the peer has cached bootstrap peers it SHOULD contact them
        first by sending a PING to the known peer address with the destination
        peer-id set to that peer's peer-id.
</p>
<p>If no cached peers are available, then the peer SHOULD send a PING
        to the address and port found in the broadcast-peers element in the
        configuration document. This MAY be a multicast or anycast address.
        The PING should use the wildcard peer-id as the destination
        peer-id.
</p>
<p>The responder peer that receives the PING SHOULD check that the
        overlay name is correct and that the requester peer sending the
        request has appropriate credentials for the overlay before responding
        to the PING even if the response is only an error.
</p>
<p>When the requester peer finally does receive a response from some
        responding peer, it can note the peer-id in the response and use this
        peer-id to start sending requests to join the DHT as described in
        <a class='info' href='#sec-join-leave-maint'>Section&nbsp;3.1.5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Joining, Leaving, and Maintenance</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#sec-dht-maint'>Section&nbsp;5.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>DHT Maintenance</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>After a peer has successfully joined the overlay network, it SHOULD
        periodically look at any peers to which it has managed to form direct
        connections. Some of these peers MAY be added to the cached-peers list
        and used in future boots. Peers that are not directly connected MUST
        not be cached. The RECOMMENDED number of peers to cache is 10.

GRUUs</h3>

<p>GRUUs do not require storing data in the DHT. Rather, they are
          constructed by embedding a base64-encoded route list in the gr URI
          parameter of the GRUU. The base64 encoding is done with the alphabet
          specified in table 1 of RFC 4648 with the exception that ~ is used
          in place of =. An example GRUU is
          "sip:alice@example.com;gr=MDEyMzQ1Njc4OTAxMjM0NTY3ODk~". When a peer
          needs to route a message to a GRUU in the same P2P network, it
          simply uses the route list and connects to that peer.
</p>
<p>Anonymous GRUUs are done in roughly the same way but require
          either that the enrollment server issue a different peer-id for each
          anonymous GRUU required or that a route list be used that includes a
          peer that compresses the route list to stop the peer-id from being
          revealed.

SIP Connect</h3>

<p>Once the route list for a user has been identified, the calling

          identified by the route list. The CONNECT request MUST contain the
          connect-application value of 5160 (SIP). If certificate-based
          authentication is in use, the responding peer MUST present a
          certificate with a peer-id matching the terminal entry in the route
          list.

<p>[[TODO: Note that this constrains route lists from hiding the

SIP Tunnel</h3>

<p>This usage allows two peers to exchange SIP messages across the
          overlay using the TUNNEL method. TUNNEL is provided as an
          alternative to using CONNECT because it allows a SIP message to be
          sent immediately, without the delay associated with CONNECT. For a
          simple SIP exchange, it may result in fewer messages being sent, as
          well.
</p>
<p>An implementation MUST use CONNECT for a dialog that is expected
          to endure for sufficient time and exchange significant numbers of
          messages. An implementation MAY establish an initial dialog using
          TUNNELing and then migrate it to a direct dialog opened with CONNECT
          once that negotiation is complete.
</p>
<p>As an application of TUNNEL, this usage defines the following
          items: </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>For SIP, the application attribute is 5060.
</li>
<li>The application MAY establish any dialog using TUNNEL if it
              expects to replace it once a CONNECT request completes. The
              application SHOULD NOT exchange messages with another SIP UA
              repeatedly using a TUNNEL unless it is unable to complete a
              CONNECT.
</li>
<li>The Replaces header should be used to migrate dialogs
              established via TUNNEL to a direct connection.
</li>
<li>The dialogid is the GRUU of the destination of the
              request.
</li>
<li>By using the GRUU of the destination as the dialogid, the
              receiving peer is able to deliver the message to the appropriate
              process without parsing the SIP message.
</li>
</ul>

<p>In constructing the message, the SIP UA forms the message as if
          it were being routed directly to the GRUU of the destination. The
          SIP stack hands the message to RELOAD for delivery. Although the
          message is passed through a sequence of untrusted peers, it is not
          subject to modification by those peers because of the message's
          signature.
</p>
<p>OPEN ISSUE: should specify how to request encryption of the
          message end-to-end.
</p>
<h3>Note:</h3>

<p>The easiest implementation of TUNNEL is likely to default to
            sending all messages across a TUNNEL when the first message is
            sent to a new destination GRUU and simultaneously issuing a
            CONNECT. Messages then continue through the TUNNEL until the
            CONNECT completes, at which point they are delivered via the new
            connection.
</p>
<p>OPEN ISSUE: If the tunneling vs direct decision can be made
          equivalently to a link-layer decision, it may not be necessary to
          modify the dialog or inform the SIP UA in any way that it has now
          obtained a direct route.

TURN Usage</h3>

<p>When a node starts up, it joins the overlay network and forms
        several connection in the process. If the ICE stage in any of these
        connection return a reflexive address that is not the same as the
        peers perceived address, then the peers is behind a NAT and not an
        candidate for a TURN server. Additionally, if the peers IP address is
        in the private address space range, then it is not a candidate for a
        TURN server. Otherwise, the peer SHOULD assume it is a potential TURN
        server and follow the procedures below.
</p>
<p>If the node is a candidate for a TURN server it will insert some
        pointers in the overlay so that other peers can find it. The overlay
        configuration file specifies a turnDensity parameter that indicates
        how many times each TURN server should record itself in the overlay.
        Typically this should be set to the reciprocal of the estimate of what
        percentage of peers will act as TURN servers. For each value, called
        d, between 1 and turnDensity, the peer forms a seed by concatenating
        its peer-ID and the value d. This seed is hashed to form a
        Resource-ID. The address of the peer is stored at that Resource-ID
        using type TURN-SERVICE and the turn-server production:
</p>
<h3>Note:</h3>

<p>Correct functioning of this algorithm depends critically on
          having turnDensity be an accurate estimate of the true density of
          TURN servers. If turnDensity is too high, then the process of
          finding TURN servers becomes extremely expensive as multiple
          candidate resource-ids must be probed.
</p>
<p>Peers peers that provide the STUN-Relay server type need to support
        the TURN extensions to STUN for media relay of both UDP and TCP
        traffic as defined in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-behave-turn'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;behave&#8209;turn]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;Obtaining Relay Addresses from Simple Traversal Underneath           NAT (STUN),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> and [Add

<p>The data is stored in a data structure with the IP address of the

        the request must contain a peer-id that when hashed would match the
        Resource-ID where the data is being stored.
</p>
<p>Peers can find other servers by selecting a random Resource-ID and
        then doing a FIND request for the appropriate server type with that
        Resource-ID. The FIND request gets routed to a random peer based on
        the Resource-ID. If that peer knows of any servers, they will be
        returned. The returned response may be empty if the peer does not know
        of any servers, in which case the process gets repeated with some
        other random Resource-ID. As long as the ratio of servers relative to
        peers is not too low, this approach will result in finding a server
        relatively quickly.

Certificate Store Usages</h3>

<p>The Certificate Store usage allows a peer to store its certificate

</p>
<p>A user/peer SHOULD store its certificate at resource-ids derived

</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The user names in the certificate.
</li>
<li>The peer-ids in the certificate.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that in the second case the certificate is not stored at the
        peer's peer-id but rather at a hash of the peer's peer-id. The
        intention here (as is common throughout RELOAD) is to avoid making a
        peer responsible for its own data.
</p>
<p>A peer should ensure that the user's certificates are stored in the
        DHT when joining and redo the check about every 24 hours after that.
        Certificate data should be stored with an expiry time of 60 days. When
        a client is checking the existence of data, if the expiry is less than
        30 days, it should be refreshed to have an expiry of 60 days. The

Overview</h3>

<p>RELOAD provides a somewhat generic DHT storage service, albeit one
        designed to be useful for P2P SIP. In this section we discuss security
        issues that are likely to be relevant to any usage of RELOAD. In the
        subsequent section we describe issues that are specific to SIP.
</p>
<p>In any DHT, any given user depends on a number of peers with which
        they have no well-defined relationship except that they are fellow
        members of the DHT. In practice, these other nodes may be friendly,
        lazy, curious, or outright malicious. No security system can provide
        complete protection in an environment where most nodes are malicious.
        The goal of security in RELOAD is to provide strong security
        guarantees of some properties even in the face of a large number of
        malicious nodes and to allow the DHT to function correctly in the face
        of a modest number of malicious nodes.
</p>
<p>P2PSIP deployments require the ability to authenticate both peers
        and resources (users) without the active presence of a trusted entity
        in the system. We describe two mechanisms. The first mechanism is
        based on public key certificates and is suitable for general
        deployments. The second is based on an overlay-wide shared symmetric
        key and is suitable only for limited deployments in which the
        relationship between admitted peers is not adversarial.

<a name="rfc.section.10.2"></a><h3>10.2.&nbsp;
Attacks on P2P Overlays</h3>

<p>The two basic functions provided by DHT nodes are storage and
        routing: some node is responsible for storing your data and for
        allowing you to fetch data from others. Some other set of nodes are
        responsible for routing messages to and from the storing nodes. Each
        of these issues is covered in the following sections.
</p>
<p>P2P overlays are subject to attacks by subversive nodes that may
        attempt to disrupt routing, corrupt or remove user registrations, or
        eavesdrop on signaling. The certificate-based security algorithms we
        describe in this draft are intended to protect DHT routing and user
        registration information in RELOAD messages.
</p>
<p>To protect the signaling, the first requirement is to ensure that
        all messages are received from authorized members of the overlay. For
        this reason, RELOAD transports all messages over DTLS or TLS, which
        provides message integrity and authentication of the directly
        communicating peer. In addition, when the certificate-based security
        system is used, messages and data are digitally signed with the
        sender's private key, providing end-to-end security for
        communications.
</p>
<p>In order to protect data storage, in the certificate-based security
        scheme, all stored data is signed by the owner of the data. This
        allows the storing peer to verify that the storer is authorized to
        perform a store at that resource-id and also allows any consumer of
        the data to verify the provenance and integrity of the data when it
        retrieves it.

<a name="rfc.section.10.3"></a><h3>10.3.&nbsp;
Certificate-based Security</h3>

<p>This specification stores users' registrations and possibly other
        data in a Distributed Hash table (DHT). This requires a solution to
        securing this data as well as securing, as well as possible, the
        routing in the DHT. Both types of security are based on requiring that
        every entity in the system (whether user or peer) authenticate
        cryptographically using an asymmetric key pair tied to a
        certificate.
</p>
<p>When a user enrolls in the DHT, they request or are assigned a
        unique name, such as "alice@dht.example.net". These names are unique
        and are meant to be chosen and used by humans much like a SIP Address
        of Record (AOR) or an email address. The user is also assigned one or
        more peer-IDs by the central enrollment authority. Both the name and
        the peer ID are placed in the certificate, along with the user's
        public key.
</p>
<p>Each certificate enables an entity to act in two sorts of
        roles:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>As a user, storing data at specific Resource-IDs in the DHT
            corresponding to the user name.
</p>
<p>As a DHT peer with the peer ID(s) listed in the
            certificate.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that since only users of this DHT need to validate a
        certificate, this usage does not require a global PKI. It does,
        however, require a central enrollment authority which acts as the
        certificate authority for the DHT. This authority signs each peer's
        certificate. Because each peer possesses the CA's certificate (which
        they receive on enrollment) they can verify the certificates of the
        other entities in the overlay without further communication. Because
        the certificates contain the user/peer's public key, communications
        from the user/peer can be verified in turn.
</p>
<p>All implementations MUST implement certificate-based security.

Shared-Secret Security</h3>

<p>For small environments where deployment of the PKI necessary to use
        a certificate-based model is impractical, RELOAD supports a shared
        secret security that relies on a single key that is shared among all
        members of the overlay. It is appropriate for small groups that wish
        to form a private network without complexity. In shared secret mode,
        all the peers share a single symmetric key which is used to key
        TLS-PSK <a class='info' href='#RFC4279'>[RFC4279]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Eronen, P. and H. Tschofenig, &ldquo;Pre-Shared Key Ciphersuites for Transport Layer Security           (TLS),&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> or TLS-SRP <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-tls-srp'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;tls&#8209;srp]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Taylor, D., &ldquo;Using SRP for TLS Authentication,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> mode. A peer which does not know the
        key cannot form TLS connections with any other peer and therefore
        cannot join the overlay.
</p>
<p>The shared-secret scheme prohibits unauthorized peers from joining
        the overlay, but it provides no protection from a compromised peer
        inserting arbitrary resource registrations, performing a Sybil
        attack<a class='info' href='#Sybil'>[Sybil]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Douceur, J., &ldquo;The Sybil Attack,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>, or performing other attacks on the
        resources or routing. Thus, it is only safe to use in limited settings
        in which peers are not adversarial. In addition, because the messages
        and data are not authenticated, each intermediate peer MUST take care
        to use TLS and check the other peer's knowledge of the shared secret,
        or message insertion is possible.
</p>
<p>If the shared secret key for the shared-key security scheme is
        discovered by an attacker, then most of the security of the scheme is
        lost: an attacker can impersonate any peer to any other peer. Thus,
        the shared-secret scheme is only appropriate for small deployments,
        such as a small office or ad hoc overlay set up among participants in
        a meeting.
</p>
<p>One natural approach to a shared-secret scheme is to use a
        user-entered password as the key. The difficulty with this is that in
        TLS-PSK mode, such keys are highly subject to dictionary attacks. If
        passwords are used as the source of shared-keys, then TLS-SRP is a
        superior choice because it is not subject to dictionary attacks.

Storage Security</h3>

<p>When certificate-based security is used in RELOAD, any given
        Resource-ID/type code pair (a slot) is deterministically bound to some
        small set of certificates. In order to write data in a slot, the
        writer must prove possession of the private key for one of those
        certificates. Moreover, all data is stored signed by the certificate
        which authorized its storage. This set of rules makes questions of
        authorization and data integrity - which have historically been thorny
        for DHTs - relatively simple.
</p>
<p>When shared-secret security is used, then all peers trust all other
        peers, provided that they have demonstrated that they have the
        credentials to join the overlay at all. The following text therefore
        applies only to certificate-based security.

<a name="rfc.section.10.5.1"></a><h3>10.5.1.&nbsp;
Authorization</h3>

<p>When a client wants to store some value in a slot, it first
          digitally signs the value with its own private key. It then sends a
          STORE request that contains both the value and the signature towards
          the storing peer (which is defined by the seed construction
          algorithm for that particular type of value).
</p>
<p>When the storing peer receives the request, it must determine
          whether the storing client is authorized to store in this slot. In
          order to do so, it executes the seed construction algorithm for the
          specified type based on the user's certificate information. It then
          computes the Resource-ID from the seed and verifies that it matches
          the slot which the user is requesting to write to. If it does, the
          user is authorized to write to this slot, pending quota checks as
          described in the next section.
</p>
<p>For example, consider the certificate with the following
          properties:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
        User name: alice@dht.example.com
        Peer-Id:   013456789abcdef
        Serial:    1234
</pre></div>
<p>If Alice wishes to STORE a value of the "SIP Location" type, the
          seed will be the SIP AOR "sip:alice@dht.example.com". The
          Resource-ID will be determined by hashing the seed. When a peer
          receives a request to store a record at Resource-ID X, it takes the
          signing certificate and recomputes the seed, in this case
          "alice@dht.example.com". If H("alice@dht.example.com")=X then the
          STORE is authorized. Otherwise it is not. Note that the seed
          construction algorithm may be different for other types.

Distributed Quota</h3>

<p>Being a peer in a DHT carries with it the responsibility to store
          data for a given region of the DHT. However, if clients were allowed
          to store unlimited amounts of data, this would create unacceptable
          burdens on peers, as well as enabling trivial denial of service
          attacks. RELOAD addresses this issue by requiring each usage to
          define maximum sizes for each type of stored data. Attempts to store
          values exceeding this size SHOULD be rejected. Because each slot is
          bound to a small set of certificates, these size restrictions also
          create a distributed quota mechanism, with the quotas administered
          by the central enrollment server.
</p>
<p>Allowing different types of data to have different size
          restrictions allows new usages the flexibility to define limits that
          fit their needs without requiring all usages to have expansive
          limits. Because peers know at joining time what usages they must
          support (see <a class='info' href='#sec-configuration'>Section&nbsp;8.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Overlay Configuration</span><span>)</span></a>), peers can to
          some extent predict their storage requirements.

<a name="rfc.section.10.5.3"></a><h3>10.5.3.&nbsp;
Correctness</h3>

<p>Because each stored value is signed, it is trivial for any
          retrieving peer to verify the integrity of the stored value. Some
          more care needs to be taken to prevent version rollback attacks.
          Rollback attacks on storage are prevented by the use of store times
          and lifetime values in each store. A lifetime represents the latest
          time at which the data is valid and thus limits (though does not
          completely prevent) the ability of the storing node to perform a
          rollback attack on retrievers. In order to prevent a rollback attack
          at the time of the STORE request, we require that storage times be
          monotonically increasing. Storing peers MUST reject STORE requests
          with storage times smaller than or equal to those they are currently
          storing. In addition, a fetching node which receives a data value
          with a storage time older than the result of the previous fetch
          knows a rollback has occurred.

Residual Attacks</h3>

<p>The mechanisms described here provide a high degree of security,
          but some attacks remain possible. Most simply, it is possible for
          storing nodes to refuse to store a value (reject any request). In
          addition, a storing node can deny knowledge of values which it
          previously accepted. To some extent these attacks can be ameliorated
          by attempting to store to/retrieve from replicas, but a retrieving
          client has trouble knowing whether it should try this or not (since
          there is a cost to doing so.)
</p>
<p>Although the certificate-based authentication scheme compromising
          a single peer from being able to forge data owned by other peers.
          Furthermore, although a subversive peer can refuse to return data
          resources for which it is responsible it cannot return forged data
          because it cannot provide authentication for such registrations.
          Therefore parallel searches for redundant registrations can mitigate
          most of the affects of a compromised peer. The ultimate reliability
          of such an overlay is a statistical question based on the
          replication factor and the percentage of compromised peers.
</p>
<p>In addition, when a type is multivalued (e.g., an array), the
          storing node can return only some subset of the values, thus biasing
          its responses. This can be countered by using single values rather
          than sets, but that makes coordination between multiple storing
          agents much more difficult. This is a tradeoff that must be made
          when designing any usage.

Routing Security</h3>

<p>Because the storage security system guarantees (within limits) the
        integrity of the stored data, routing security focuses on stopping the
        attacker from performing a DOS attack on the system by mis-routing
        requests in the DHT. There are a few obvious observations to make
        about this. First, it is easy to ensure that an attacker is at least a
        valid peer in the DHT. Second, this is a DOS attack only. Third, if a
        large percentage of the peers on the DHT are controlled by the
        attacker, it is probably impossible to perfectly secure against
        this.

<a name="rfc.section.10.6.1"></a><h3>10.6.1.&nbsp;
Background</h3>

<p>In general, attacks on DHT routing are mounted by the attacker
          arranging to route traffic through or two nodes it controls. In the
          Eclipse attack <a class='info' href='#Eclipse'>[Eclipse]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Singh, A., Ngan, T., Druschel, T., and D. Wallach, &ldquo;&quot;Eclipse Attacks on Overlay Networks: Threats and           Defenses&quot;,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> the attacker tampers
          with messages to and from nodes for which it is on-path with respect
          to a given victim node. This allows it to pretend to be all the
          nodes that are reachable through it. In the Sybil attack <a class='info' href='#Sybil'>[Sybil]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Douceur, J., &ldquo;The Sybil Attack,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>, the attacker registers a large number of
          nodes and is therefore able to capture a large amount of the traffic
          through the DHT.
</p>
<p>Both the Eclipse and Sybil attacks require the attacker to be
          able to exercise control over her peer IDs. The Sybil attack
          requires the creation of a large number of peers. The Eclipse attack
          requires that the attacker be able to impersonate specific peers. In
          both cases, these attacks are limited by the use of centralized,
          certificate-based admission control.
</p>

<a name="rfc.section.10.6.2"></a><h3>10.6.2.&nbsp;
Admissions Control</h3>

<p>Admission to an RELOAD DHT is controlled by requiring that each
          peer have a certificate containing its peer ID. The requirement to
          have a certificate is enforced by using TLS mutual authentication on
          each connection. Thus, whenever a peer connects to another peer,
          each side automatically checks that the other has a suitable
          certificate. These peer IDs are randomly assigned by the central
          enrollment server. This has two benefits:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>It allows the enrollment server to limit the number of peer
              IDs issued to any individual user.
</li>
<li>It prevents the attacker from choosing specific peer IDs.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The first property allows protection against Sybil attacks
          (provided the enrollment server uses strict rate limiting policies).
          The second property deters but does not completely prevent Eclipse
          attacks. Because an Eclipse attacker must impersonate peers on the
          other side of the attacker, he must have a certificate for suitable
          peer IDs, which requires him to repeatedly query the enrollment
          server for new certificates which only will match by chance. From
          the attacker's perspective, the difficulty is that if he only has a
          small number of certificates the region of the DHT he is
          impersonating appears to be very sparsely populated by comparison to
          the victim's local region.

<a name="rfc.section.10.6.3"></a><h3>10.6.3.&nbsp;
Peer Identification and Authentication</h3>

<p>In general, whenever a peer engages in DHT activity that might
          affect the routing table it must establish its identity. This
          happens in two ways. First, whenever a peer establishes a direct
          connection to another peer it authenticates via TLS mutual
          authentication. All messages between peers are sent over this
          protected channel and therefore the peers can verify the data origin
          of the last hop peer for requests and responses without further
          cryptography.
</p>
<p>In some situations, however, it is desirable to be able to
          establish the identity of a peer with whom one is not directly
          connected. The most natural case is when a peer UPDATEs its state.
          At this point, other peers may need to update their view of the DHT
          structure, but they need to verify that the UPDATE message came from
          the actual peer rather than from an attacker. To prevent this, all
          DHT routing messages are signed by the peer that generated them.
</p>
<p>[TODO: this allows for replay attacks on requests. There are two
          basic defenses here. The first is global clocks and loose
          anti-replay. The second is to refuse to take any action unless you
          verify the data with the relevant node. This issue is
          undecided.]
</p>
<p>[TODO: I think we are probably going to end up with generic
          signatures or at least optional signatures on all DHT messages.]

<a name="rfc.section.10.6.4"></a><h3>10.6.4.&nbsp;
Protecting the Signaling</h3>

<p>The goal here is to stop an attacker from knowing who is
          signaling what to whom. An attacker being able to observe the
          activities of a specific individual is unlikely given the
          randomization of IDs and routing based on the present peers
          discussed above. Furthermore, because messages can be routed using
          only the header information, the actual body of the RELOAD message
          can be encrypted during transmission.
</p>
<p>There are two lines of defense here. The first is the use of TLS
          or DTLS for each communications link between peers. This provides
          protection against attackers who are not members of the overlay. The
          second line of defense, if certificate-based security is used, is to
          digitally sign each message. This prevents adversarial peers from
          modifying messages in flight, even if they are on the routing
          path.

Residual Attacks</h3>

<p>The routing security mechanisms in RELOAD are designed to contain
          rather than eliminate attacks on routing. It is still possible for
          an attacker to mount a variety of attacks. In particular, if an
          attacker is able to take up a position on the DHT routing between A
          and B it can make it appear as if B does not exist or is
          disconnected. It can also advertise false network metrics in attempt
          to reroute traffic. However, these are primarily DoS attacks.
</p>
<p>The certificate-based security scheme secures the namespace, but
          if an individual peer is compromised or if an attacker obtains a
          certificate from the CA, then a number of subversive peers can still
          appear in the overlay. While these peers cannot falsify responses to
          resource queries, they can respond with 404 error messages,
          effecting a DoS attack on the resource registration. They can also
          subvert routing to other compromised peers. To defend against such
          attacks, a resource search must still consist of parallel searches
          for replicated registrations.
