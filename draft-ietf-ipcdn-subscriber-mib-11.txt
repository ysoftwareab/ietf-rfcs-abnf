Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines a set of managed objects for SNMP-based
   management of Data-over-Cable Service Interface Specification
   (DOCSIS)-compliant Cable Modem Termination Systems. These managed
   objects facilitate protection of the cable network from misuse by
   subscribers.

   This memo is a product of the IPCDN working group within the Internet
   Engineering Task Force.  Comments are solicited and should be
   addressed to the working group's mailing list at ipcdn@ietf.org
   and/or the author.

1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

2. Overview

   This MIB provides a set of objects required for the management of
   DOCSIS Cable Modem Termination Systems (CMTS). The specification is
   derived in part from the operational model described in the DOCSIS
   Radio Frequency Interface Specification [DOCSRFI]. These managed
   objects facilitate protection of the cable network from misuse by
   subscribers.

   The following figure illustrates the operational and physical
   deployment relationships between elements in a cable modem network.
   This MIB resides at the CMTS, which is the first point in the public
   data network at which the cable operator controls physical access.
   The CMTS (possibly assisted by other IP services devices) acts as a
   network edge, separating the physical outside-plant cable television
   network from the operator's IP network.

   This MIB controls IP packet forwarding to and from each cable modem,
   at the CMTS. Different modems may be accorded different treatment.

   Much of this MIB duplicates capabilities found in the DOCSIS Cable
   Device MIB [RFC2669]. While it is expected that the Cable Device MIB
   will be used to prevent unwanted traffic from entering the cable
   network, it is also possible that a malicious user might tamper with
   cable modem software, disabling its filtering policies. This MIB
   provides a more secure mechanism, since physical access to the CMTS
   is controlled by the network operator.

   In particular, this MIB provides two capabilities: first, to limit
   the IP addresses behind a modem, and, second, to provide protocol
   filtering to and from a modem. The first duplicates the capabilities
   of the docsDevCpe group [RFC2669]. This provides for either learned
   or provisioned subscriber premises host IP addresses behind a cable
   modem.

   The filtering capability makes use of the Classification, Counting,
   and Drop facilities of the Differentiated Services MIB [RFC3289]. In
   order to provide different filtering for various classes of
   subscribers, this MIB defines the docsSubMgtFilterGroupTable which
   specifies which filters are to apply to each subscriber packet.  This
   table is used by RFC3289 as a first pass of classification, to then
   choose a second pass of classification using the
   diffServMultiFieldClfrTable:

   diffServDataPathStart --> diffServClfrEntry(1)
   diffServClfrElementSpecific(1) --> docsSubMgtFilterGroupIndex
   diffServClfrElementNext(1) --> diffServClfrEntry(2)
   diffServClfrElementSpecific(2)--> diffServMultiFieldClfrEntry
   diffServClfrElementNext(2) --> difServActionEntry (count or algDrop)

   Rather than maintaining a separate list of filters for each modem at
   the CMTS, it is assumed that large numbers of modems will share
   filtering characteristics. Therefore, DOCSIS signaling defines filter
   groups by which cable modems share common filter lists.

2.1. Structure of the MIB


Expires  November 2003                                         [Page 3]

INTERNET-DRAFT      DOCSIS Subscriber Management MIB            May 2003

   This MIB is structured in four tables:

   o    The docsSubMgtCpeControlTable controls the acceptance of
        subscriber host addresses behind a cable modem.

   o    The docsSubMgtCpeIpTable monitors the subscriber host addresses
        which the CMTS believes to exist behind the cable modem.

   o    The docsSubMgtCmFilterTable binds a cable modem to a set of
        filters in diffServMultiFieldClfrTable.

   o    The docsSubMgtFilterGroupTable provides the OIDs by which
        the diffServClfrElementTable selects a filter group.

   The docsSubMgtCpeControlTable and docsSubMgtCmFilterTable AUGMENT the
   docsIfCmtsCmStatusTable from [RFC2670]. Similarly,
   docsSubMgtCpeIpTable expands this table (an additional index is
   used). As such, each entry in these tables is bound to a registered
   cable modem, as perceived by the CMTS.

2.1.1. docsSubMgtFilterGroupTable

   The docsSubMgtFilterGroupTable is unusual in that it might be viewed
   not so much as an array of single-object entries as an array of
   OBJECT-IDENTIFIER conventions. Each instance of
   docsSubMgtFilterGroupIndex serves as an OID reference for
   diffServClfrElementSpecific. The index value corresponds to the
   filter group identifier signaled by the cable modem [DOCSRFI].  An
   entry exists in this Table if a reference to it exists in
   diffServClfrElementSpecific.

   As such, contrary to common practice, the index for the table is
   read-only, and is both the Entry's index and its only value.

2.2. Management requirements

   The DOCSIS cable modem provisioning model [DOCSRFI] requires that
   cable modems use TFTP to acquire a list of parameters. The modem then
   passes many of these parameters to the CMTS in the DOCSIS
   Registration message. The parameter values are digitally signed by
   the creator of the TFTP contents, and the signature is verified by
   the CMTS. In general, then, the CMTS need not itself be configured
   with the attributes of its cable modems. It will acquire these values
   through the Registration process that is secured by the digital
   signature.

   Cable modem subscriber management, as described here, modifies this
   process slightly for reasons of data reduction and ease of
   administrative control.  In the case of filtering management, for
   example, the tables are maintained through SNMP at the CMTS, and the
   modem registration merely signals the index values for the rows that
   apply to that modem.

INTERNET-DRAFT      DOCSIS Subscriber Management MIB            May 2003

2.2.1. Interaction with DOCSIS provisioning for CPE address control

   Rows in docsSubMgtCpeControlTable are created by the CMTS for each
   modem as a result of the DOCSIS registration process. The DOCSIS
   registration attributes may include items semantically equivalent to
   those in the DocsDevCpe branch of the DOCSIS Cable Device MIB
   [RFC2669]:

   o    docsDevCpeEnroll
   o    docsDevCpeIpMax
   o    docsDevCpeIp

   Successful DOCSIS registration shall have the effect of setting the
   corresponding fields in the docsSubMgtCpeControlTable and the
   docsSubMgtCpeIpTable. If not present, the default at registration
   shall be to set docsSubMgtCpeControlActive to false.

   Rows in docsSubMgtCpeIpTable are created through any of three ways:
   DOCSIS registration (as described above), learning by the CMTS, or
   through some unspecified administrative mechanism on the CMTS. The
   docsDevCpeIpMax table bound applies only to the first two.

   The CMTS may learn addresses by simply snooping source IP addresses
   from each cable modem. Other learning mechanisms (for example, ARP
   snooping) may be used. The learning mechanism is not defined by this
   document.

2.2.2. Interaction with DOCSIS provisioning for filtering

   Rows in docsSubMgtCmFilterTable are created by the CMTS for each
   modem as a result of the DOCSIS registration process. The DOCSIS
   registration attributes may include four indices (see section
   C.1.1.18.3 of [DOCSRFI]):

   o   one identifying the upstream filter group for packets
       originating from the cable modem (i.e., those packets whose
       source MAC address matches that of the cable modem).
   o   one identifying the upstream filter group for packets
       originating from subscribers attached to the cable modem (i.e.,
       those packets whose source MAC address does not match that of
       the cable modem).
   o   one identifying the downstream filter group for packets
       destined to the cable modem (i.e., those packets whose
       destination MAC address matches that of the cable modem).
   o   one identifying the downstream filter group for packets
       destined to subscribers attached to the cable modem (i.e.,
       those packets whose destination MAC address does not match
       that of the cable modem).

   Successful registration shall have the effect of setting
   docsSubMgtCmFilterDownstream, docsSubMgtCmFilterUpstream,
   docsSubMgtSubFilterDownstream, and docsSubMgtSubFilterUpstream, for
   that modem (just as if set through the SNMP protocol). If the DOCSIS

INTERNET-DRAFT      DOCSIS Subscriber Management MIB            May 2003

   attributes are not present, the effect shall be to use the default
   entry (diffServClfrElementSpecific=zeroDotZero) specified in the
   diffServClfrElementTable.

2.2.3. Distinguishing Modem from Subscriber Traffic

   All traffic originating from or destined to a subscriber site is
   potentially suspect, and subject to suppression by the network
   operator.  This is true even if the traffic is ostensibly sourced or
   sunk by the cable modem itself, rather than the subscriber hosts
   behind the modem. To provide more nuanced administrative control,
   this document allows separate filter policies for modems and hosts.
   For example, modem policies may limit modems to server-subnet-only
   access, while allowing a different scope to subscribers.

   The CMTS chooses the filter set to apply based solely on the MAC
   address (source MAC upstream, destination MAC downstream). If the MAC
   address matches that of the modem, then the
   docsSubMgtCmFilterUp/Downstream pair is used; otherwise the
   docsSubMgtSubFilterUp/Downstream pair is applied.

   If the CM acts as a router rather than as a DOCSIS bridging
   forwarder, then the network operator will only use the
   docsSubMgtCmFilterUp/Downstream pair.

2.3. Relationship to the Differentiated Services MIB [RFC3289]

   DOCSIS CMTSs rely on the classification, counting, and drop
   facilities of the Differentiated Services MIB to screen subscriber
   packets for IP, TCP, and UDP characteristics. It is expected that any
   implementation of this MIB also include at least the following from
   RFC 3289:

   o    diffServDataPathTable
   o    diffServClfrTable
   o    diffServClfrElementTable
   o    diffServMultiFieldClfrTable
   o    diffServActionTable
   o    diffServCountActTable
   o    diffServAlgDropTable (diffServAlgDropType=alwaysDrop)

   The use of other facilities from RFC 3289 is not precluded, but is
   beyond the scope of this specification.

   The base capability of RFC 3289 assumes that all packets on the same
   direction of the same interface will be classified by the same
   criteria. Filter Groups, introduced in this document, expand on RFC
   3289 to allow various subscribers to receive different classification
   (filtering) treatment. One way to view filter groups is as sub-
   interfaces within the physical DOCSIS channel. Another way to view
   them is as values of a field logically prepended to the packet prior
   to classification:

INTERNET-DRAFT      DOCSIS Subscriber Management MIB            May 2003

   [filter group][docsis MAC header][IP header]...

   Of course this 'logical' field has no existence outside of the CMTS.

   The diffServClfrTable and diffServClfrElementTable are then used
   twice: the first classifiers select among filter groups, using OIDs
   from docsSubMgtFilterGroupTable. The 'next' action on matching a
   filter group is to select a diffServClfrEntry which now classifies on
   IP/TCP/UDP criteria (the diffServMultiFieldClfrTable_.  The 'next'
   action on this second match may be a 'count' (and accept), a 'drop',
   or some other feature from RFC 3289.

2.4. Filtering and the Tiny Fragment Attack

   It is recommended that the implementers prevent the "tiny fragment"
   and "overlapping fragment" attacks for the TCP filtering tables in
   this MIB, as discussed in RFC 1858 [RFC1858] and RFC 3128 [RFC3128].

   Prevention of these attacks can be implemented with the following
   rules, when filtering is enabled:

   o    admit all packets with fragment offset >= 2

   o    discard all packets with fragment offset = 1, or with fragment
        offset = 0 AND fragment payload length < 16.

   o    apply filtering rules to all packets with fragment offset = 0.

7. Security Considerations

   This MIB is intended to limit certain kinds of network behavior by
   subscriber hosts attached to cable modems, including, for example, IP
   spoofing. These limitations may be compromised, however, if the cable

   modem's identity or registration process is spoofed. The DOCSIS RFI
   and privacy specifications [DOCSRFI] and [DOCSBPI] define a number of
   mechanisms for assuring modem identity.

   The filtering mechanism defined here can be defeated through the
   "tiny fragment" and "overlapping fragment" attacks if the
   recommendations in section 2.2.6 are omitted. See [RFC1858] and
   [RFC3128] for discussion of these attacks.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   Unauthorized SETs to this MIB can permit two major security problems
   with public cable network operation: IP address spoofing, and defeat
   of operator-defined packet filtering.

   The following objects, if SET maliciously, would evade controls on
   address spoofing:

       docsSubMgtCpeControlMaxCpeIp
       docsSubMgtCpeControlActive
       docsSubMgtCpeControlLearnable
       docsSubMgtCpeControlReset
       docsSubMgtCpeMaxIpDefault
       docsSubMgtCpeActiveDefault
       docsSubMgtCpeLearnableDefault

   The following objects could also permit packet filtering to be
   defeated:

       docsSubMgtSubFilterDownstream
       docsSubMgtSubFilterUpstream
       docsSubMgtCmFilterDownstream
       docsSubMgtCmFilterUpstream

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt
   the values of these objects when sending them over the network via
   SNMP. The most sensitive is docsSubMgtCpeIpAddr within
   docsSubMgtCpeIpTable. While docsSubMgtCpeIpTable is intended to
   control address spoofing, it includes information about the current
   subscriber address pool. This information may itself be valuable to
   would-be spoofers.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is

   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
