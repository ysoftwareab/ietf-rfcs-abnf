B => one value in the range 0-35 mapped to a character as above
X => one value in the range 0-31 mapped to a character as above

latin  => a character in the range 0-0x217
base36 => all other characters

latin  => as themselves, 00 for 0, 88 for 8 or as 10 bit value
                encoded as 0XX (two 5 bit values)
base36 => as a base 36 value represented by its current base 36
                prefix followed by three base 36 digits encoded as BBB
                (the value is prefix*36*36*36*36+B*36*36+B*36+B)
                Before encoding the character value must first be
                reduced:
                  if >= 0xd800 reduce by 8192 (private/surrogate start)
                  then reduce by 0x2FFF.
                After decoding the character value need to be restored
other  => the characters represent itself

X5 => switch 10 10bit mode using X as current prefix
X7 => switch to base36 mode using X as current prefix
XX => current 10bit prefix plus XX gives the character

XXX => current base36 prefix plus XXX as base 36 values gives
