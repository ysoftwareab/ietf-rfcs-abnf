Result = 1 (denied): 
 
     Subtract all terminations from the context.  Either initiate call 
     clearing or wait for the subscriber to clear the call, depending 
     on local policy. 
 
Result = 2 (callback): 
    
     Initiate call clearing for the current circuit connection.   
     Remaining actions as for the next case. 
    
     Note that if the NAS Release event is enabled an instance will be 
     generated with reason code 16 (callback) following the 
     Authorization Exception event. 
    
Result = 3 (outgoing): 
    
     Update the Session Identifier and Connection Type of the NAS 
     termination and add Dialout Number (see the NAS Outgoing package).  
     Select and add a new circuit termination (possibly wildcarded) for 
     the outgoing call.  Initiate an outgoing call to the number 
     provided by the Authorization Exception event.  Add bearer 
     capability parameters to the new circuit termination when 
     available.  Perform continuity testing on the new circuit 
     termination if required, before setting streamMode to SendReceive.
