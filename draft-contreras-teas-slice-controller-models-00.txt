1.  Introduction

   Editor's Note: the terminology in this draft will be aligned with the
   final terminology selected for describing the notion of IETF Network
   Slice when applied to IETF technologies, which is currently under
   discussion.  By now same terminology as used in
   [I-D.nsdt-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition] and
   [I-D.nsdt-teas-ns-framework] is primarily used here.  Consensus to
   use "IETF Network Slice" term has been reached.

   The generic idea of network slicing intends to provide tailored end-
   to-end network capabilities to customers in the way that they could
   be perceived as a dedicated network, despite the fact that it makes
   use of shared physical infrastructure facilities.

   Among the capabilities mentioned, connectivity of different parts of
   a network slice with particular characteristics play a central role.
   Thus, the concept of IETF Network Slice, realized by any of the IETF
   technologies, emerges as complementary but essential part of an end-
   to-end network slice.

   In order to facilitate the request, realization and lifecycle control
   and management of a transport slice, a new element named IETF Network

Internet-Draft    Slice Controller and its data models     November 2020


   Slice Controller (NSC) is being proposed in
   [I-D.nsdt-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition] and
   [I-D.nsdt-teas-ns-framework].

   The NSC from its North Bound Interface (NBI) exposes set of APIs that
   allow a higher level system to request an end-to-end transport slice.
   It receives the request of enablement of an IETF Network Slice by a
   customer (i.e. creation, modification or deletion).  Upon receiving a
   request from its NBI, NSC finds the resources needed for realization
   of the IETF Network Slice and in turn interfaces from its South Bound
   Interface (SBI) with one or more Network Controllers for the
   realization of the requested IETF Network Slice request and the
   management of its lifecycle.  Figure 1 presents a high-level view of
   the TSC.

             Figure 1: Interface of Transport Slice Controller

   This memo describes the characteristics of the NSC as well as a
   detailed structure of the NSC and its major components.  In addition,
   it describes the characteristics of the data models to identify the
   IETF Network Slice and its realization.  Then the data models
   referred are mapped to the interfaces among components.

2.  IETF Network Slice data models

   At the time of provisioning and operating IETF Network Slices
   different views can be identified as necessary:




Contreras , et al.         Expires May 6, 2021                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft    Slice Controller and its data models     November 2020


   o  Customer's view, mostly focused on the individual IETF Network
      Slice request process, reflecting the needs of each particular
      customer, including SLOs and other characteristics of the slice
      relevant for it.  This view is technology agnostics and describes
      the characteristics of the IETF Network Slice from a customer's
      point of view.  It can include the slice topology, performance
      parameters, endpoints of the slice, traffic characteristics of the
      slice, and the KPIs to monitor the slice.

   o  Provider's view, mostly focused on the provisioning and operation
      of the IETF Network Slices in the transport network, considering
      how a particular IETF Network Slice interplays with other IETF
      Network Slices maintained by the provider on a shared
      infrastructure.  In other words, operator's view shows how an IETF
      Network Slice is realized in operator's network along with all the
      resources used during the its realization.

   Both views are complementary, each of them specialized for a given
   purpose.  In consequence, it should be consistency between both in
   order to ensure alignment.

   Currently there are two different models proposed, on for each of the
   categories above.  The model in
   [I-D.wd-teas-ietf-network-slice-nbi-yang] fits into the customer
   view, while the model defined in
   [I-D.liu-teas-transport-network-slice-yang] fits in to the provider
   view.

   It should be noted that for the realization of a transport slice, the
   NSC interacts with one or more Network Controllers.  In that case,
   the data models to be used are particular for each Network Controller
   (e.g., technology dependent), as well as the mapping function from
   its NBI to SBI and the details of this mapping function are both out
   of the scope of this document.

3.  Structure of the IETF Network Slice Controller (NSC)

   The NSC should work with both data models.  The NSC takes first the
   customer's view by analyzing the needs of the customer, processing
   such requests taking into account the overall view of the network and
   the IETF Network Slices already instantiated, normalizing its
   instantiation across different technologies, and finally generates
   the provider view.

   Once the new request is processed and declared as feasible, the NSC
   triggers its realization by interacting with the Network Controllers
   and communicates back to the higher level controller to start the
   billing cycle.

Internet-Draft    Slice Controller and its data models     November 2020


   In order to accommodate these procedures, the internal structure of
   the NSC can be divided into:

   o  IETF Network Slice Mapper: this high-level component processes the
      customer request, putting it into the context of the overall IETF
      Network Slices in the network.

   o  IETF Network Slice Realizer: this high-level component processes
      the complete view of transport slices including the one requested
      by the customer, decides the proper technologies for realizing the
      IETF Network Slice and triggers its realization.

   Figure 2 illustrates the components described and the associated
   models, as follows

   o  (a) -> customer's view, e.g.
      [I-D.wd-teas-ietf-network-slice-nbi-yang].

   o  (b) -> provider's view, e.g.
      [I-D.liu-teas-transport-network-slice-yang].

   o  (c) -> models per network controller, out of scope of this
      document

     Figure 2: IETF Network Slice Controller structure and asspociated
                                data models

   TODO item #1 - Breakdown "NS mapper" and "NS Realizer" to their
   logical components.

   TODO item #2- Add complementarity of the models for satisfying Type 1
   and Type 2 Services as per [RFC8453].  Discussion: equivalent to the
   Virtual Network (VN) described in [RFC8453], there are two views of
   an IETF network slices as well:

   o  The IETF network slice can be abstracted as a set of edge-to-edge
      links (Type 1).

   o  The IETF network slice can be abstracted as a topology of virtual
      nodes and virtual links (Type 2) which represent the partitioning
      of underlay network resources for use by network slice
      connectivity.

   The use cases of these two types of networks are further described by
   [RFC8453].  [I-D.wd-teas-ietf-network-slice-nbi-yang] models the Type
   1 service, while [I-D.liu-teas-transport-network-slice-yang] models
   the Type 2 service.  When a customer intends to request a Type 2
   service, [I-D.liu-teas-transport-network-slice-yang] can also be used

   at the point (a) in Figure 2.  As an example, when ACTN is used to
   realize an IETF network slice, model mappings are described in more
   details in [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-yang].
