1. Introduction

   This document introduces a YANG [RFC6020] data model for Routing
   Information Protocol (RIP)[RFC2453][RFC2080]. RIP was designed to
   work as an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) in moderate-size
   Autonomous Systems (AS).

   This YANG model supports both RIP version 2 and RIPng. RIP version 2
   defined in [RFC2453] supports IPv4. RIPng defined in [RFC2080]
   supports IPv6.

1.1. Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14, [RFC2119].

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6020] and are not redefined
   here:

      o  augment

      o  data model

      o  data node

4. IANA Considerations

   RFC Ed.: In this section, replace all occurrences of 'XXXX' with the
   actual RFC number (and remove this note).

   This document registers the following namespace URIs in the IETF XML
   registry [RFC3688]:

   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   name:         ietf-rip
   namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-rip
   prefix:       rip
   reference:    RFC XXXX
   --------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Security Considerations

   The configuration, state, and action data defined in this document
   are designed to be accessed via the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241]. The
   data-model by itself does not create any security implications. The
   security considerations for the NETCONF protocol are applicable. The
   NETCONF protocol used for sending the data supports authentication
   and encryption.
