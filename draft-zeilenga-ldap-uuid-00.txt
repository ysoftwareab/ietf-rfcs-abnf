Abstract

  This document describes the LDAP/X.500 'entryUUID' operational
  attribute and associated matching rules and syntax.  The attribute
  holds a server-assigned Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) for the
  object.  Directory clients may use this attribute to distinguish
  objects identified by a distinguished name or to locate an object
  after renaming.

INTERNET-DRAFT               LDAP entryUUID                  11 May 2003


1. Background and Intended Use

  In X.500 Directory Services [X.501], such as those accessible using
  the the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [RFC3377], an
  object is identified by its distinguished name (DN).  However, DNs are
  not stable identifiers.  That is, a new object may be identified by a
  DN which previously identified another (now renamed or deleted)
  object.

  This document describes the 'entryUUID' operational attribute holds
  the Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) [ISO11578] assigned to the
  object by the server.  Clients may use this attribute to distinguish
  objects identified by a distinguished name or to locate an object
  after renaming.

  This document defines the UUID syntax, the 'uuidMatch' and
  'uuidOrderingMatch' matching rules, the 'entryUUID' attribute type.

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].

  Schema definitions are provided using LDAP description formats
  [RFC2252].  Definitions provided here are formatted (line wrapped) for
  readability.


2. UUID Schema Elements

2.1 UUID Syntax

  A Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) [ISO11578] is a 16-octet value
  which identifies object.  The ASN.1 [X.690] type UUID is defined to
  represent UUIDs.

      UUID ::= OCTET STRING{16} -- constrained to an UUID [ISO 11578]

  In LDAP, values of the UUID are encoded using the string
  representation described in [ISO11578].  For example,
  597ae2f6-16a6-1027-98f4-d28b5365dc14.

      ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.1 DESC 'UUID' )


2.2 'uuidMatch' Matching Rule

  The 'uuidMatch' matching rule compares an asserted UUID with a stored
  UUID for equality.  Its semantics are same as octetStringMatch

INTERNET-DRAFT               LDAP entryUUID                  11 May 2003


  [X.520][RFC2252].

      ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.2 NAME 'uuidMatch'
          SYNTAX IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.1 )


2.3 'uuidOrderingMatch' Matching Rule

  The 'uuidOrderingMatch' matching rule compares an asserted UUID
  with a stored UUID for ordering.  Its semantics are the same as
  octetStringOrderingMatch [X.520][RFC2252].

      ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.3 NAME 'uuidMatch'
          SYNTAX IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.1 )


2.4. 'entryUUID' attribute

  The 'entryUUID' operational attribute provides the Universally Unique
  Identifier (UUID) [ISO11578] assigned to the entry.

      ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.4 NAME 'entryUUID'
          DESC 'UUID of the entry'
          EQUALITY uuidMatch
          ORDERING uuidOrderingMatch
          SYNTAX IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.1
          SINGLE-VALUE
          NO-USER-MODIFICATION
          USAGE directoryOperation )

  Servers SHALL assign a UUID to each entry upon its addition to the
  directory  and provide the entry's UUID as the value of the
  'entryUUID' operational attribute.  An entry's UUID is immutable.


3. Security Considerations

  Servers should ensure that components of UUID values are publicly
  disclosable.

  General LDAP security considerations [RFC3377] apply.


4. IANA Considerations

4.1. Object Identifier Registration

  It is requested that IANA register upon Standards Action an LDAP
