       Message Authentication Code for the Network Time Protocol
                         draft-ietf-ntp-mac-05

Abstract

   RFC 5905 [RFC5905] states that Network Time Protocol (NTP) packets
   should be authenticated by appending a 128-bit key to the NTP data,
   and hashing the result with MD5 to obtain a 128-bit tag.  This
   document deprecates MD5-based authentication, which is considered to
   be too weak, and recommends the use of AES-CMAC [RFC4493] as a
   replacement.

1.  Introduction

   RFC 5905 [RFC5905] states that Network Time Protocol (NTP) packets
   should be authenticated by appending a 128-bit key to the NTP data,
   and hashing the result with MD5 to obtain a 128-bit tag.  This
   document deprecates MD5-based authentication, which is considered to
   be too weak, and recommends the use of AES-CMAC [RFC4493] as a
   replacement.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Deprecating the use of MD5

   RFC 5905 [RFC5905] defines how the MD5 digest algorithm in RFC 1321
   [RFC1321] can be used as a message authentication code (MAC) for
   authenticating NTP packets.  However, as discussed in [BCK] and RFC
   6151 [RFC6151], this is not a secure MAC and therefore MUST be
   deprecated.

3.  Replacement Recommendation

   If authentication is implemented, then AES-CMAC as specified in RFC
   4493 [RFC4493] SHOULD be computed over all fields in the NTP header,
   and any extension fields that are present in the NTP packet as
   described in RFC 5905 [RFC5905].  The MAC key for NTP MUST be at

   least 128 bits long AES-128 key and the resulting MAC tag MUST be at
   least 128 bits long as stated in section 2.4 of RFC 4493 [RFC4493].
   NTP makes this transition possible as it supports algorithm agility
   as described in Section 2.1 of RFC 7696 [RFC7696].

   The hosts who wish to use NTP authentication share a symmetric key
   out-of-band.  So they MUST implement AES-CMAC and share the
   corresponding symmetric key.  A symmetric key is a triplet of ID,
   type (e.g.  MD5, AES-CMAC) and the key itself.  All three have to
   match in order to succesfully authenticate packets between two hosts.
   Old implementations that don't support AES-CMAC will not accept and
   will not send packets authenticated with such a key.

4.  Motivation

   AES-CMAC is recommended for the following reasons:

   1.  It is an IETF standard that is available in many open source
       implementations.

   2.  It is immune to nonce-reuse vulnerabilities (e.g.  [Joux])
       because it does not use a nonce.

   3.  It has fine performance in terms of latency and throughput.

   4.  It benefits from native hardware support, for instance, Intel's
       New Instruction set.

5.  Test Vectors

   For test vectors and their outputs refer to Section 4 of RFC 4493
   [RFC4493]

6.  Security Considerations

   Refer to the Appendices A, B and C of NIST document [NIST] and
   Security Considerations Section of RFC 4493 [RFC4493] for discussion
   on security guarantees of AES-CMAC.

   Alshenibr, Daniel Franke, Ethan Heilman, Kenny Paterson, Leonid
   Reyzin, Harlan Stenn, and Mayank Varia.
