Internet-Draft    MPLS-TP NM Auto discovery requirement     October 2009


1.  Introduction

   Layer network topology display on NMS, and can refresh quickly on any
   change happen on managed network, this function is very useful and
   important in current and future TMN.  It implies equipment should
   provide some mechanism to support, such as auto discovery.  These
   also apply to TMN of MPLS-TP network.  Assuming server layer is exist
   and in working status.  From NMS point of view, the following MPLS-TP
   specific information are expected to retrieve from network element.
   And any change on these information, are expected to report to NMS
   immediately, in spite of whether control plane is exist or not. .


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].



3.  Information for LSP layer to be discovered

   From NMS point of view, the following MPLS-TP specific information
   are expected to retrieve from network element.


   -  Local NE identifier

   -  Local NE address

   -  Local node(LSR) identifier

   -  Local node(LSR) address

   -  Corresponding sever layer connection point identifier

   -  Adjacent NE identifier

   -  Adjacnet NE address

   -  Adjacent node(LSR) ID

   -  Adjacent node(LSR) address

   -  Adjacent corresponding sever layer connection point identifier

   If connection is exist the following information on per-connection
   are also needed:

   -  LSP identifiers

   -  Local LSR identifier

   -  Adjacent LSR identifier

   -  Label

   If protection is involve, the following information on per-
   protection-group are also needed:

   -  Protection group identifier

   -  Working LSP identifier

   -  Protecting LSP identifier

   -  Adjacent LSR identifiers in protection group

   -  Protection type

   -  Current protection status


4.  Information for PW layer to be discovered

   From NMS point of view, the following MPLS-TP specific information
   are expected to retrieve from network element.

   -  Local NE identifier

   -  Local NE address

   -  Local node(PE) ID

   -  Local node(PE) address

   -  Corresponding sever layer connection point identifier

   -  Adjacent NE identifier
