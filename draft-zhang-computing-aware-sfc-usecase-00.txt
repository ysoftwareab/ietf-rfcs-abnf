      Use Cases of Computing-aware Service Function Chaining (SFC)
               draft-zhang-computing-aware-sfc-usecase-00

Abstract

   Multiple occurrences of the same service function(SF) can exist in
   the same administrative domain and each occurrence of SF is called SF
   instance.  A Service Function Path(SFP) is determined by composing
   selected SF instances and overlay links.  The SF instances are
   selected according to the computing power of SFs in addition to the
   network information and this is defined as the computing-aware SFC in
   this document.

   This document describes the use cases for computing-aware Service
   Function Chaining(SFC).

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7665]defines the architecture for SFC and mentions load-balancing
   considerations of the scenario that is same service function may be
   reachable through multiple SFFs.The selection of which SFF to use to
   reach SF may be made by the control logic in defining the SFP, or may
   be left to the SFFs themselves, depending upon policy, solution, and
   deployment constraints.

   [I-D.ietf-sfc-control-plane] indicates that implementing a
   (logically) centralized path computation engine requires information
   to be dynamically communicated to the central SFC Control Element,
   such as the list of available SF instances, SFF locators, load
   status, SFP availability, etc.  SF load update information such as
   the performance threshold or stress level of SF can be exchanged
   between an SF and the SFC control plane to establish or adjust an
   SFP.

   In this document the computing power of SF includes computing
   resources and computing load of SF.  For example, the compute
   resource can be the vCPUs allocated to SF, and the compute load can
   be the CPU utilization of SF or the ratio of the number of SFPs
   currently using SF to the maximum number of SFPs supported by SF.

   Multiple instances of the same service function(SF) can exist in the
   same administrative domain.  A Service Function Path(SFP) is
   determined by composing selected SF instances and overlay links.The
   SF instances can be selected according to the computing power of SFs
   in addition to the network information and this is defined as the
   computing-aware SFC.

   This document describes the use cases for computing-aware Service
   Function Chaining(SFC).

2.  Use Cases of Computing-aware SFC

2.1.  Computing-aware SFC in multiple data centers(DCs)

   In carrier networks, operators may deploy multiple data centers or
   computing resource pools dispersed geographically.  These data
   centers can host diverse types of value-added services(VASes) such as
   FW(Firewall), IPS(Intrusion Prevention System), WOC(Web Optimization
   Control) and VO(Video Optimizer) shared by the enterprise leased line
   services, internet services etc.

   Each data center may have different types of service functions.  For
   example, high usage service functions are deployed in edge or
   regional data centers while other low usage service functions are
   deployed in global or central data centers.  So SFCs with different
   types of service functions may span multiple data centers.

   The same service function can be deployed in multiple data centers.
   In such deployments the SF in one data center is called a SF
   instance.  SFPs are constructed with the ordered chain of SFs each of
   which is from specific data center.

   The path computation of SFP should consider the computing load of SFs
   and the cost or latency of network paths between the DCs hosting the
   SFs in order to get the good service experience of SFs and the
   optimal end to end network path.

   In Figure 1, A enterprise tenant orders SFC with a chain of two
   value-added services for its access to internet service.  The
   sequenced services of SFC are FW and VO.

         Figure 1: Illustration of Computing-aware SFC

   The current computing load status of the FW SFs in DC1 and DC2 is as
   follows: each SF uses 6 vCPUs.  The load of DC1 is 50%. The load of
   DC2 is 20%. Considering lightly loaded SF the computed SFP is
   represented as: DC2 FW -> DC3 VO.  Traffic follows the path: CPE ->
   R1 -> R2 -> DC2 FW -> R2 -> R3 ->DC3 VO -> R3 -> R4 -> internet

   The procedures for SFP creation according to computing power of SFs
   and network topology may be handled by the control plane as follows:

   1.Collect computing power which are computing resources and computing
   load of of SFs in DCs

   2.Associate the DC location and computing power of the available SFs
   with topological information of network connecting all the data
   centers to allow control plane to construct the overall map

   The following potential solutions could be considered:

   *  Collect the SF's location and computing power by BGP-LS or Netconf
      from the router connecting the data centers and dynamically get
      the association relationship.

   *  Independently collect the SF location and computing power by other
      means and statically configure the association with the network on
      the control plane.

   3.Compute the actual sequence of specific routers and selected SFs in
   the network for SFP

   If the same SF is deployed in multiple data centers the control plane
   selects one SF instance for SFP considering the computing load of SF
   and the cost or latency of network paths between the DCs hosting the
   SFs.

   4.Deliver the actual computed path called Rendered Service Path (RSP)
   [RFC7665] to the routers to steer the traffic from classifier to
   destination

   In some cases SFP adjustments can be handled.  For example, a SF in
   the selected DC fails, the load of the same SF in each DC varies
   greatly, and the delay is caused among routers connected to the DC.
