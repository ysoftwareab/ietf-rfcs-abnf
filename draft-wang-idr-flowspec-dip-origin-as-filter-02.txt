       Destination-IP-Origin-AS Filter for BGP Flow Specification
            draft-wang-idr-flowspec-dip-origin-as-filter-02

Abstract

   BGP Flowspec mechanism [RFC5575] [I-D.ietf-idr-rfc5575bis] propogates
   both traffic Flow Specifications and Traffic Filtering Actions by
   making use of the BGP NLRI and the BGP Extended Community encoding
   formats.  This document specifies a new BGP-FS component type to
   support AS-level filtering.  The match field is the origin AS number
   of the destination IP address that is encoded in the Flowspec NLRI.

1.  Introduction

   BGP Flow Specification (BGP-FS) [RFC5575] [I-D.ietf-idr-rfc5575bis]
   defines a new BGP NLRI to distribute traffic flow specification rules
   via BGP ([RFC4271]).  BGP-FS policies have a match condition that may
   be n-tuple match in a policy, and an action that modifies the packet
   and forwards/drops the packet.  Via BGP, new filter rules can be sent
   to all BGP peers simultaneously without changing router
   configuration, and the BGP peer can install these routes in the
   forwarding table.  BGP-FS defines Network Layer Reachability
   Information (NLRI) format used to distribute traffic flow
   specification rules.  NLRI (AFI=1, SAFI=133) is for IPv4 unicast
   filtering.  NLRI (AFI=1, SAFI=134) is for BGP/MPLS VPN
   filtering.[I-D.ietf-idr-flowspec-l2vpn][I-D.ietf-idr-flowspec-l2vpn]
   extends the flow-spec rules for layer 2 Ethernet packets.

   This document specifies a new BGP-FS component type to support AS-
   level filtering.  The match field is the origin AS number of the
   destination IP address that is encoded in the Flowspec NLRI.

2.  Definitions and Acronyms

   o  FS: Flow Specification

   o  Destination-IP-Origin-AS: The origin AS number of the destination
      IP address

3.  The Flow Specification Encoding for Destination-IP-Origin-AS Filter

   This document proposes a new flow specification rule that is encoded
   in the NLRI.  The following new component type is defined.

   o  Destination-IP-Origin-AS

   Type TBD1 - Destination-IP-Origin-AS

   Encoding: <type (1 octet), [op, value]+>

   Contains a set of {operator, value} pairs that are used to match the
   Destination-IP-Origin-AS (i.e. the origin AS number of the
   destination IP address).

   The operator byte is encoded as:

       0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | e | a |  len  | 0 |lt |gt |eq |
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+


   Where:

   e - end-of-list bit.  Set in the last {op, value} pair in the list.

   a - AND bit.  If unset, the previous term is logically ORed with the
   current one.  If set, the operation is a logical AND.  It MUST be
   unset in the Destination-IP-Origin-AS filter.

   lt - less than comparison between data and value.

   gt - greater than comparison between data and value.

   eq - equality between data and value.

   The bits lt, gt, and eq can be combined to produce match the
   Destination-IP-Origin-AS filter or a range of Destination-IP-Origin-
   AS filter(e.g. less than AS1 and greater than AS2).

Internet-Draft       Destination-IP-Origin-AS Filter          March 2020


   The value field is encoded as:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +---------------------------------------------------------------+
     ~       Destination-IP-Origin-AS  (4 octets)                    ~
     +---------------------------------------------------------------+

   Per section 11 of [I-D.ietf-idr-rfc5575bis] , If a receiving BGP
   speaker cannot support this new Flow Specification component type, it
   MUST discard the NLRI value field that contains such unknown
   components.  Since the NLRI field encoding (Section 4 of
   [I-D.ietf-idr-rfc5575bis]) is defined in the form of a 2-tuple
   <length, NLRI value>, message decoding can skip over the NLRI value
   and continue with subsequent NLRI and message decoding.

4.  Use Case

   In AS64597's R1, if the ISP AS64597 wants to redirect all packets
   from IP Prefix 61 to AS64598, first goto to R3, then forward to
   AS64598", the ISP can use the traditional method or the method
   defining in this draft.

     Figure 1: Steering the Traffic Using Flowspec

   Using the traditional method, the ISP AS64597 needs to setup multiple
   "Destination Prefix + Source Prefix" rules in Router R1 as following:

    +--------------+--------------+-------------------------+
    | Destination  | Source Prefix| Redirect to IP Nexthop  |
    | Prefix       |              |                         |
    +--------------+--------------+-------------------------+
    | IP Prefix 81 | IP Prefix 61 |       R3                |
    +--------------+--------------+-------------------------+
    | IP Prefix 82 | IP Prefix 61 |       R3                |
    +--------------+--------------+-------------------------+
    | IP Prefix 83 | IP Prefix 61 |       R3                |
    +--------------+--------------+-------------------------+
    | IP Prefix 84 | IP Prefix 61 |       R3                |
    +--------------+--------------+-------------------------+
    |                  More...                              |

   Using the method defining in this draft, the ISP AS64597 needs to
   setup only one "Destination Origin AS + Source Prefix" rule in Router
   R1 as following:

     +--------------+--------------+-------------------------+
     | Destination  | Source Prefix| Redirect to IP Nexthop  |
     | IP Origin AS |              |                         |
     +--------------+--------------+-------------------------+
     |  64598       | IP Prefix 61 |       R3                |
     +--------------+--------------+-------------------------+

     Figure 3: Steering the Traffic Using Origin AS and Source Prefix


   Obviously, the new method defining in this draft saves a lot of entry
   spaces on the control plane and forwarding plane, and it would
   greatly simplify the operation of the control plane, and the more
   destination prefixes an AS has, the more obvious the benefit.

5.  Security Considerations

   No new security issues are introduced to the BGP protocol by this
   specification.

6.  IANA

   IANA is requested to a new entry in "Flow Spec component types
   registry" with the following values:
