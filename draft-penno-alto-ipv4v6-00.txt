             ALTO and IPv4/IPv6 Co-existence and Transition
                       draft-penno-alto-ipv4v6-00

Abstract

   IPv4/IPv6 co-existence and transition is topic or great discussion
   and interest.  In order to deal with IPv4 depletion ISPs have some
   techniques at their disposal such as Carrier Grade NAT , DS-Lite and
   6rd.

   As this techniques get deployed, they change the topology of the
   network by creating gateways or overlays which in the end affect how
   ALTO might work.  This draft discusses such impacts and possible
   solutions.

Internet-Draft             ALTO and IPv4/IPv6                  June 2010


1.  Introduction

   IPv4/IPv6 co-existence and transition is topic or great discussion
   and interest.  In order to deal with IPv4 depletion ISPs have some
   techniques at their disposal, one of which, Carrier Grade NAT, is
   probably the most popular due to the fact it requires no changes in
   the infrastructure or end hosts.  Other techniques based on Softwires
   such as DS-Lite help with IPv4 depletion IPv6 introduction. 6rd helps
   IPv6 introduction and leverages existing IPv4 access networks.

   As this techniques get deployed, they change the topology of the
   network by creating gateways or overlays which in the end affect how
   ALTO might work.  This draft discussed such impacts and possible
   solutions.


2.  Scope

   This document discusses how the issues that IPv4/IPv6 co-existence
   and transition brings to ALTO and how to possibly solve them.  This
   draft is a work in progress and will be updates based on feedback and
   discussions.


3.  Terminology

   The reader should be familiar with terminology introduced by RFC 2663
   [RFC2663], RFC 4787 [RFC4787], NAT64 [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate],
   DS-Lite [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite] and Carrier Grade NAT
   [I-D.nishitani-cgn]


4.  Landscape

   During the co-existence period there will be three address 'families'
   on the Internet: private IPv4, public IPv4 and IPv6.  The same host
   could be using one or more IP address from each of the families and
   certainly different hosts within a home or enterprise could be
   accessing the network using different address families.  In this
   context, ALTO clients and servers still need to a consistent and
   deterministic view of the network.  But this co-existence brings some
   pitfalls that should be avoided, for example:

   o  An ALTO Client with only a public IPv4 has no use of a cost map
      that contains private IPv4 addresses.

   o  An ALTO Client with only an IPv6 address has no use for a IPv4
      cost map, whether private or public.

Internet-Draft             ALTO and IPv4/IPv6                  June 2010


   Furthermore, with NAT migrating from the user CPE to the network and
   the creation of overlays, the impact on the network and cost maps and
   the associated placement of the ALTO Server needs to be evaluated.
   In the next sections we will discuss some of these scenarios, their
   implications and possible solutions.


5.  Carrier Grade NAT

   In the case of CGN, a NAT device is deployed in the edge of the
   network instead of (or in addition to ) the NAT at the CPE.  In this
   scenario the placement of the ALTO Server and Client(s) becomes
   specially important.  If the Alto Server in on the private network,
   the network and cost maps built from such data are not of use to
   clients on the Internet or on the ISP's public network.  If on the
   other hand the ALTO Server is on the ISP's public network and the
   ALTO Clients reside on end hosts (P2P case), the cost between
   endpoints becomes the cost between CGN boxes.

   (postamble)

5.1.  Assumptions

   The following assumptions are common for all Alto Server - CGN
   interworking use cases:

   o  In absence of failures, any given CPE always uses the same CGN.
      All sessions from the CPE pass through that CGN.

   o  The assignment of CPEs to CGN is determined by a policy specified
      by the provider.  The assignment does not change while both the
      CPE and the CGN are alive

   o  A Content Origin Server will typically reside in a public network,
      since all its clients will connect to it at Port 80, which can not
      be translated by the NAT.

5.2.  Endpoint Property Service

   The Endpoint Property Lookup query allows an ALTO Client to lookup
   properties of Endpoints known to the ALTO Server.  In the case where
   the ALTO Server is on the ISP's public network, the 'pid' property
   remains as is since a public IPv4 address belongs to a PID.  On the
   other hand, properties that are different across endpoints such as
   bandwidth and access type need modification.

   In other to make use of this service to query properties associated
   exclusively with an endpoint, the query would need to be extended to
   include a public transport port associated with the private IP
   address.  This stems from the fact that many private IPv4 addresses
   are mapped to the same public IPv4 address.

5.3.  Endpoint Cost Service

   The endpoint cost service does not need modification.  The cost might
   have different semantics but the query can be used as specified in
   the ALTO protocol.

5.4.  ALTO Server in ISP's Public Network

   In this case the network and cost map are built based on NAT pool
   addresses configured at each CGN.  If the architecture is distributed
   such that the cost from endpoints to the CGN does not vary
   significantly, the ALTO Service should not be impacted.  In fact,
   having an anchor point such as a CGN might present some advantages
   such as a natural mapping between PID and CGN and deterministic
   traffic flow and therefore cost map.

5.5.  ALTO Server in ISP's Private Network

   If the ALTO Server and associated network and cost maps are based on
   the private network they might provide more fine granular guidance
   but such maps could not be used by outside parties.  One way to solve
   this problem is to have another ALTO Server on the public side and
   provide two network and cost maps to clients.


6.  Softwires

   Softwires create a overlay on top of the current IP infrastructure.
   Everything between the Softwire Initiator and Concentrator is seen as
   a 'single-hop' or virtual link from the network users point of view.
   Therefore, the network and cost maps should be built similar to the
   CGN case where the ALTO Server is place in the ISP's public network.

   In the case of 6rd which is based on stateless IP anycast operation,
   there is no way to know a priori which border relay will be used by a
   CPE.  This makes computation of network maps and consequently cost
   maps problematic.

   DS-Lite requires NAPT44 and therefore traffic from and endhost is
   expected to flow drought the same NAPT device consistently.  IP
   anycast could be used with DS-Lite as well but NAPT44 requires
   traffic flows to be more deterministic.


7.  ALTO and CDNs

   For CDN use cases, we have to differentiate whether the CDN is in the
   same administrative domain as the CPE's Network Provider or not.

7.1.  Same Administrator Domain

   The network provider may want to place cache nodes as close to the
   CPE as possible, i.e., in the private network.

   Alto Server HTTP Redirector / DNS Redirector all in the private
   network.  We are optimizing the traffic through the private network,
   choosing a cache node in the private network which is the closest to
   the CPE.

   Assume the Cache Node also goes though its own CGN, so we must
   optimize the whole path CPE->Cache->CGN->Origin Server.
   CPE->Cache->CGN can be optimized by the private network Redirector
   using private network's Alto Server Network Maps.  For CGN->Origin
   Server optimization we need Network Maps from a public network Alto
   Server - this is likely a similar situation as we had in the multi-
   domain CDN case (the interesting part is that the model seems to be
   similar to the multi-domain model, yet this is a single domain case,
   but the public/private split makes it look like multi-domain.

7.2.  Different Administrator Domains

   In this case the CDN cache nodes will also reside in a public
   network, and all traffic between the CPE and either the Origin Server
   and/or the cache node will go through the CGN.  Since the assignment
   of CPEs to the CGN is static, we can only optimize traffic in the
   public network by selecting a cache node that is closest to the CPE's
   CGN.

   This would work with both HTTP redirection and DNS redirection as
   described in ALTO and CDNs [I-D.penno-alto-cdn].  The Alto Server in
   the public network would provide network maps to either an HTTP

   Redirector or a DNS Redirectors, which would choose a cache node
   closest to the CPE's CGN.  Neither the Alto Server nor the HTTP
   Redirector nor the DNS Redirector is aware of the private network and
   that the CPE is behind a NAT.  (Note that this would work pretty much
   the same as CPE-based NATs today.)
