         Declaring Kerberos Realm Names in DNS (_kerberos TXT)
                      draft-vanrein-dnstxt-krb1-09

Abstract

   This specification defines a method to determine Kerberos realm names
   for services that are known by their DNS name.  Currently, such
   information can only be found in static mappings or through educated
   guesses.  DNS can make this process more flexible, provided that
   DNSSEC is used to assure authenticity of resource records.

1.  Introduction

   When a Kerberos client contacts a service, it needs to acquire a
   service ticket, and for that it needs to contact the KDC for a realm
   under which the service is run.  To map a service name into a realm
   name and then into a KDC, clients tend to use static mappings or
   educated guesses; the client's KDC may or may not be involved in this
   process.  Through DNS, the static mappings could be replaced by
   dynamic lookups, and migrate from local client configuration into the
   hands of the party administrating a server's presence in DNS.  This
   brings improved flexibility and centralisation, which is
   operationally desirable.

   Two mappings are needed for a client to contact a service.  One is a
   mapping from the FQDN of a service to its realm name; the other is a
   mapping from the realm name to the Kerberos-specific services such as
   the KDC.  The latter mapping is published in SRV records [RFC4120]
   and such traffic is usually protected by Kerberos itself.  The first
   mapping however, has hitherto not been standardised and is ill-
   advised over unsecured DNS because the published information is then
   neither validated by DNS nor does it lead to a protocol that could
   provide end-to-end validation for it.

   With the recent uprise of DNSSEC, it is now possible to make a
   reliable judgement on the authenticity of data in DNS, which enables
   the standardisation of the first mapping in the form of resource
   records under DNSSEC.

   This specification defines a method to publish and process Kerberos
   realm names in TXT resource records.  These records hold a case-
   sensitive string with the realm name.  This has been informally

   described and practiced, but generally considered insecure; adding
   DNSSEC means that much of this existing practice can now be trusted.

   It is suggested to use the name "_kerberos TXT" to informally refer
   to the style of using DNS that is introduced in this specification.

2.  Defining _kerberos TXT Resource Records

   This specification uses the TXT resource record type in DNS to
   represent a Kerberos realm name.  The corresponding RDATA format is
   as follows:

   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
   /                   REALMNAME                   /
   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

   The REALMNAME is represented as a <character-string> [RFC1035] which
   starts with a single-byte length, followed by as many bytes of realm
   name as the length byte's value.  The RDATA field therefore has a
   length of 1 up to 256 bytes, to hold a realm name of 0 up to 255
   bytes.  For instance, a realm EXAMPLE.ORG would be represented with
   the following RDATA, written in the notation for unkonwn resource
   record types [RFC3597]:

   \# 12 ( 0b 45 58 41 4d 50 4c 45 2e 4f 52 47 )

   The REALMNAME represents a Kerberos realm name [Section 6.1 of
   [RFC4120]], not a DNS name; invalid names SHOULD be ignored.  The
   empty string is considered an invalid REALMNAME, and it should be
   noted that a REALMNAME may exceed the size constraints of a DNS name.

   The TXT record can hold one or more <character-string> values in an
   ordered sequence, and implementations of this specification MUST NOT
   reject TXT records with multiple <character-string>s.  This
   specification only describes the meaning of the first <character-
   string> as a REALMNAME, and leaves the interpretation of further
   <character-string>s to future specifications.  Until these
   specifications are adopted, master zone files SHOULD NOT introduce
   these extra <character-string>s.  If such future specifications
   intend to specify Kerberos aspects that do not include a realm name,
   then they can mention an invalid realm name such as an empty
   <character-string>.

   Though any style of realm name may be published as _kerberos TXT, it
   is common for realm names in Kerberos to follow the domain style
   [Section 6.1 of [RFC4120]], in which case they look like DNS names
   but are case sensitive; unlike the DNS names used as lookup keys in
   the DNS hierarchy, the REALMNAME format follows the <character-

   string> format in being case-sensitive.  Even for domain-style realm
   names, there is no required relationship (such as partial overlap)
   between the realm name and the DNS name at which a TXT record is
   found.

   In fact, the <character-string> format is a binary format, and DNS
   notation \DDD [Section 5.1 of [RFC1035]] exists to put arbitrary
   bytes in the string notation.  This binary format leaves the door
   ajar for future internationalisation of Kerberos realm names.  Realm
   names are defined with the KerberosString type [Section 5.2.1 of
   [RFC4120]] which is an ASN.1 GeneralString, but its specification
   currently advises to constrain the use of this string type to an
   IA5String (basically using only the first 128 codes of the ASCII
   table) to avoid interoperability problems.  After the <character-
   string>'s length byte, the REALMNAME holds the value of the
   GeneralString, but not its preceding ASN.1 tag and length.

   It is worth noting that the ESC "%" "G" prefix [TODO:xref
   target="ISO2022"/] can be used to introduce an UTF8String in a
   GeneralString, and that implementations exist that insert UTF8String
   values in KerberosString fields without even that escape.  All this
   precedes formal standardisation of internationalisation, but it
   suggests that the RDATA definition for TXT can be supportive of
   future internationalisation of realm names, even if the current
   advised use is limited to the value of an IA5String.

   It is possible to create a TXT record for any _kerberos-prefixed DNS
   name, but this specification only provides query procedures for host
   names and domain names.  The use with a domain name has the
   additional use of denoting the precise spelling for a realm name
   under its DNS-mapped name.  DNS-mapped names currently would not
   modify more than the case of a DNS name, and even that is only done
   as the result of DNS compression [RFC4343]; but in a future with
   internationalised realm names there might be more to reconstruct, in
   which case this facility is likely to be helpful.

   The format for the resource data in master zone files is standard for
   DNS [RFC1035].  The TXT record is a general record and was not
   especially designed for this purpose.  The reason to use it
   nonetheless is that it is an existing practice; the particular use
   specified here is distinguished from comments in TXT records by
   always prefixing a _kerberos label to a DNS name.  An example
   declaration of realm name EXAMPLE.ORG for a server named
   imap.example.org would be:

   imap.example.org.            IN AAAA  2001:db8::143
   _kerberos.imap.example.org.  IN TXT   "EXAMPLE.ORG"

   The RDATA for this TXT record is shown above, in the generic RDATA
   section notation.

3.  Publishing Kerberos Realm Names

   Zones that intend to provide applications with Kerberos realm names
   through _kerberos TXT records SHOULD protect them with DNSSEC.

   Operators SHOULD NOT define more than one valid realm name for a
   given domain or host name.

   Note that _kerberos TXT records with wildcard names will not work.
   All host names and most domain names define at least one resource
   record (of any type) with the name that the wildcard should cover.
   These defined names cause the wildcards to be suppressed [RFC4592]
   from DNS responses, even when querying a non-existent TXT record.

4.  Querying Kerberos Realm Names

   This section defines a procedure for determining the Kerberos realm
   names for a server with a given host name or domain name, as well as
   for a DNS-mapped realm name.  This specification does not impose any
   restriction on the additional use of other-than-DNS methods for for
   obtaining a realm name.

   When applications know their server host name, perhaps because it is
   mentioned in a URL or in a ticket as a service principal name, or
   when applications know a domain name for which they intend to learn
   the realm name, they resolve the TXT record in DNS at the server host
   name, prefixed with a _kerberos label.

   Since DNS in general cannot be considered secure, the client MUST
   validate DNSSEC and it MUST dismiss any DNS responses that are
   Insecure, Bogus or Indeterminate [Section 5 of [RFC4033]].  Only the
   remaining Secure responses are to be taken into account.  This
   specification does not require that the DNS client validates the
   responses by itself, but a deployment of _kerberos TXT records SHOULD
   NOT accept DNS responses from a trusted validating DNS resolver over
   untrusted communication channels.

   In addition to the above, the absense of a _kerberos DNS record may
   be meaningful for security decisions.  If such cases, the only denial
   of existence of the _kerberos TXT records MUST be authenticated
   denial.

   Only the first lt;character-string> of a _kerberos TXT record is
   considered; any further ones are silently ignored under this

   specification.  In addition, invalid realm names such as they empty
   string are silently ignored.

   To give one possible implementation, a Kerberos client or its KDC may
   send DNS queries with the Authentic Data (AD) bit set to enable
   DNSSEC [Section 5.7 of [RFC6840]], and thereby request that the
   Authenticated Data bit is set in the response to indicate [RFC3655]
   the Secure state for answer and authority sections of the response.
   When the DNS traffic to and from the validating resolver is
   protected, for instance because the validating resolver is reached
   over a loopback interface, then the Kerberos client or its KDC has
   implemented the requirements for Secure use of the answer and
   authority sections in DNS responses.

   When no Secure DNS responses are received when the DNS query times
   out, then the TXT query MUST be terminated without extracting realm
   names from DNS.  This termination MAY be done immediately upon
   receiving Secure denial for the requested TXT record.  TXT query
   termination need not be fatal; non-DNS procedures may exist to find a
   realm name, including the current practice of static mappings and
   educated guessing.

5.  Efficiency Considerations

   The lookup of _kerberos TXT records can be done by the Ticket
   Granting Service of a KDC, which can respond with a Server Referral
   [Section 8 of [RFC6806]] to Kerberos clients that enable
   canonicalization.  This can be used for clients that are not setup to
   query DNS as specified above, and that will assume that a service is
   running under the client's realm.  The caching of DNS records, their
   validation and possibly realm-crossover caching at the KDC can all
   benefit the response time for future lookups by other Kerberos
   clients.

6.  Privacy Considerations

   This specification barely publishes new information in DNS, with the
   exception of markation of Kerberised services.  When this is
   considered unattractive from a privacy viewpoint, it may be better to
   rely on the existing static tables for spreading this information in
   a more controlled manner.

7.  Security Considerations

   There is no restriction for _kerberos TXT records to mention realm
   names that map back to DNS names in a disjoint part of the DNS
   hierarcy.  The records could therefore specify realm names for a
   service even if the service is not recognised by the realm.  The KDC

   for the appointed realm would be very clear about that when trying to
   procure a service ticket, so there is no anticipated security issue
   with such misguided use of _kerberos TXT records.

   The general point is that the use of DNSSEC makes Kerberos accept
   authentic information from the party that publishes the _kerberos TXT
   record, and that party could specify improper realm names or drop
   realm names that are vital to the client.  This is not expected to be
   a security risk either; the party publishing the _kerberos TXT record
   is the same party that publishes the service's records, namely its
   DNS operator.  By publishing the service's record in DNS, this
   operator already has potential control over service denial and other
   man-in-the-middle attacks, so the _kerberos TXT record does not add
   any new powers of abuse.

   When an external attacker would be permitted to spoof a _kerberos TXT
   record in a victim's DNS, then it could be possible for that attacker
   to convince the client that the attacker is the authentic provider
   for the service.  Additional spoofing of host name references could
   then complete the attack.  This has been mitigated by strictly
   requiring Secure validation results from a DNSSEC-aware resolver for
   all _kerberos TXT records.

8.  IANA Considerations

   None.
