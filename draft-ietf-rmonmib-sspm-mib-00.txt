INTERNET DRAFT                  SSPM MIB                        Nov 2001


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines a method of describing Synthetic Sources
   for Performance Monitoring (SSPM). This is useful within the RMON
   framework for performance monitoring in the cases where it is
   desireable to inject packets into the network for the purpose of
   monitoring their performance with the other MIBs in that framework.

   This memo also includes a MIB module.  This MIB module extends the
   list of managed objects specified in [xx] and [xx].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [xx].

2.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

      o An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [1].

      o Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
      purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in RFC
      1155 [2], RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The second version,
      called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5], RFC 1903 [6] and RFC
      1904 [7].

      o Message protocols for transferring management information. The
      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
      described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message
      protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
      called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
      The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and
      described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11] and RFC 2274 [12].

      o Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
      described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations and
      associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

      o A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and
      the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275
      [15].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED","MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [16].

3. Overview

   This document defines a MIB for the purpose of remotely controlling
   synthetic sources (or 'active' probes) and sinks for the purpose of
   enhancing remote performance monitoring capabilities within IP
   networks and services.  Much work within the IETF exists related to
   performance monitoring.  One interesting aspect of this body of work
   is that it does not explicitly define an 'active' probe capability.
   An active probe capability is complimentary to existing capabilities,
   and this MIB is developed to fill this void.  The utility of this
   function within the Internet and the relationship of this MIB to
   other working group activities is discussed in a framework document
   [<draft-cole-sspm-03.txt>].

   The rperfman BOF in Adelaide in March of 2000 was held to discuss the
   possibility of developing a standard set of synthetic probes for
   performance management functions.  It was agreed at that time to move
   forward with the development of this MIB and that this work would be
   sponsored within the RMONMIB WG.  For more information on the outcome
   of this BOF, refer to the meeting minutes [rperfmanBOF minutes by
   Bierman].

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

      o 'Performance monitoring' is the act of monitoring traffic for
      the purpose of evaluating a statistic of a metric related to the
      performance of the system.  A performance monitoring system is
      comprised of a) traffic generators, b) measurement, c) data
      reduction, and d) reporting.  The traffic generators may be
      natural sources, synthetic sources or intrusive sources.

INTERNET DRAFT                  SSPM MIB                        Nov 2001


      o A 'synthetic source' is a device or an embedded software program
      which generates a data packet (or packets) and injects it (them)
      onto the path to a corresponding probe or existing server solely
      in support of a performance monitoring function.  A synthetic
      source may talk intrusively to existing application servers.

   The design goals for this MIB are:

      o Compliment the overall performance management architecture being
      defined within the RMONMIB WG - this MIB is defined within the
      context of the appmcapsMIB.

      o Extensibility - the MIB should be easily extended to include a
      greater set of protocols and applications for performance
      monitoring purposes.

      o Flexible - it should support both round trip and one way
      measurements.

      o Security - the control of the source and sink of traffic is
      handled by a management application and communication is
      recommended via SNMPv3.

   This document is organized as follows.  The next section discusses
   the relationship of this MIB to other MIBs from the RMONMIB and
   DISMAN working groups.  Then the structure of the MIB is discussed.
   Finally, the MIB definitions are given.

4. Relationship to other MIBs

   This MIB is designed to be used in conjunction with the RMON MIB
   Working Groupss two other MIBs for application performance
   measurement: Application Performance Measurement MIB and Application
   Performance Measurement Framework Transport Performance Metrics MIB.
   These MIBs define reporting capabilities for that framework. The
   intent of this MIB is to define a method for injecting packets into
   the network utilizing probe capabilities defined in the base MIBs and
   measured with the reporting MIBs.

   Specifically, this MIB uses the AppLocalIndex as defined in the APM-
   MIB to map measurement configuration information to defintion and
   reporting structures defined in the APM-MIB.

5. MIB Structure

   This section presents the structure of the MIB. The objects are
   arranged into the following groups:

      o general information

      o source configuration

      o link layer extentions

      o application layer extentions

      o sink configuration

      o history information

5.1.  general information
   This section provides general information about the capabilities of
   the probe. Currently this information is related to the resolution of
   the probe clock and its source.

5.2.  source configuration
   This MIB takes an IP centric view of the configuration of the
   measurement.  The source table provides configuration information for
   the IP layer portions of the measurements.

5.3.  link layer extentions
   The link layer extentions table allows configuration of link layer
   attributes within the test.

5.4.  application layer extentions
   The application layer extentions provides the ability to provide the
   configuration of application layer attributes.

5.5.  sink configuration
   Configures the sink for measurements. If the test is round-trip then
   this table is on the same probe as the source configuration. If the
   test is one-way then the table is on a different probe. The
   sspmSinkInstance is a unique identifer for the entry per probe.
   Additional attributes are provided for test type and source of the
   test to uniquely identifier entries in the table.

5.6.  history information
   This section of the MIB defines some configuration attributes to
   control the size of the history table and what happens when the table
   is full. The table is intended to provide information about the raw
   data of the tests from when then measurements were made. It is not
   intended as the general purpose reporting function. That function is
   to be provided by the before mentioned MIBs.

   Two tables are defined: sspmHistoryConfigTable and sspmHistoryTable.
   The first configures how the history table operates, its size and the

   the last entry per sink. The second table contains the actual history
   information.

9.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   The nature of the MIB is that it defines objects to allow packets to
   be injected into the network for the purpose of measuring some
   performance characteristics. There are some attributes which allow
   specifically configuring various fields in Link and IP layer packets.

   There are some attributes which configure username and password
   information for some application level protocols. Access to these
   attributes may provide unauthorized use of resources.

   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them
   over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features
   for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

INTERNET DRAFT                  SSPM MIB                        Nov 2001


   It is RECOMMENDED that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2274 [12] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2275 [15] is RECOMMENDED.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.

12. Issues

   This section will ultimately be removed from the document.  It
   captures a list of open issues that need to be resolved as this
   document is discussed.

      o Should sspmClockSource define various levels of ntp resolution?

      o Should the packet fill for URL fail if the probe does not
      support that ability?

      o sspmApplLayerExtentionParameter - We also discussed deleteing
      this attribute and instead describing how one might define such an
      attribute in a private extention in the appendix of this ID.

      o Should start/end times be specified? Or should these be left to
      the NMS and or implementation of the schedule/script MIBs to set
      the control bit on/off.

      o start time - time to start some test. Controlled by the control
      object to enable

      o end time - when test ends. Purhaps duration is a better term

      o repeat time - for configuing test which run once per hour, day,
      week, etc.  Perhaps this can/should be done with the DISMAN
      shedule MIB.

      o Should Appl Layer Parameter be defined. Could need to set more
      attributes for this. One option is a follow on MIB say for HTTP to
      set header values, etc.

      o This was is a reference to a performance monitoring protocol.  (
      http://telesto.advanced.org/~kalidindi/STR/owdp.html  ).  Need to
      consider if the constructs described can be implemented with this
      MIB.

      o Need to flush out conformance and compliance.

      o Current definition of sspmSourceType and sspmSinkType prevent
      configuration of measurements that are not reportable in apm/tpm.
      May want to add some OID type to indicate non-apLocalIndex.

      o May need to add application specific configuration tables. At
      least need to configure which attributes are part of the protocol
      header or body.

      o What are the requirements for indexing on the history table. Do
      we want to add an additional index to allow query based on a
