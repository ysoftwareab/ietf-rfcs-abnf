       Applying Forensic Science to Trusted Enterprise Network
                      draft-mitchell-nwg-00.txt


Abstract

   The Trusted Platform Module, for the past decade, has shown potential
   to improve computer security. However, there is growing concerns that
   the Trusted Platform Module, and its related technologies might be
   challenging for Forensic Investigators to acquire and analyze certain
   digital evidence. For example, if the key evidence is encrypted, and
   cryptographically bound to a set of platform characteristics, then
   those characteristics must exist on the platform (that is being used
   to decrypt the evidence) before the evidence can be decrypted.
   As a result, it is believed that if a suspect cryptographically
   bound the evidence to the platform characteristics, and those
   characteristics in some way got changed, then it might not be
   possible to decrypt the potential evidence.

   For this reason, we explored how Trusted Platform Module and its
   related technologies might support digital forensic analysis 
   within a trusted enterprise network.

1.  Introduction

The Trusted Computing Group (TCG) has been mandated to develop a set of
vendor-neutral specifications for the current design of the trusted
computing system. The main component of the TCG's specifications is a
security chip called the Trusted Platform Module (TPM). The TPM is a
tampered-evident security microcontroller that is physically mounted
on the mainboard of a trusted platform (such as laptops, PDAs, PCs,
servers, and mobile phones).

Although the architectural design of TPM device cannot withstand
physical attacks, it is nonetheless tampered-evident, and therefore
it is possible to detect most physical tampering, such as
de-soldering. In addition, the TPM is complex in design, but small
enough for verification. According to 
[TCG2007], the TPM provides the root of trust, which is used to
extend trust to other hardware and/or software components.

The TPM provides two main mechanisms which must be properly configured
and managed to assist digital forensic investigations, otherwise digital
forensic on trusted platform might be challenging. These two functions
include the provision of a crypto co-processor to protect sensitive 
data or messages, and an integrity, storage and reporting measurement
mechanism, which is used to provide evidence of the platform's state or
current configuration.

                     to Trusted Enterprise Network 




3. The TPM's crypto co-processor data protection system
3.1. Binding Operation

A typical TPM-based binding operation is similar to the conventional
asymmetric encryption [Sadeghi2008]. In that, it uses the public key
of the intended recipient to encrypt the message, and the private key
of the intended recipient to decrypt the message. The encryption keys 
can be either designated (at creation) as migratable or non-migratable.
Interestingly, if a potential digital evidence where bound using a 
non-migratable key of a particular TPM, then it would only be possible
to decrypted that data using the device that has the specific instance
of the TPM which holds the corresponding private key 
[Mason2005];[Sadeghi2008]. Nevertheless, as explained by 
[TCG2007], "it is possible to create migratable private keys that
are transferable between multiple TPM devices".


3.2 Sealed-binding or Sealing Operation

The sealing operation further increased the complexity of evidence
acquisition, whereby it allows possible digital evidence to be
cryptographically bound to a predetermined configuration
(hardware and/or software), which must exist on the target system
before the evidence can be decrypted or unsealed [TCG2007]. 
For instance, the BitLocker Drive Encryption feature available
in the ultimate and enterprise versions of Windows Vista, and Windows 
7 Operating Systems, encrypts the drives volumes using a key called
full volume encryption key (FVMK). The integrity of FVEK is protected
by a special encryption master key called the Volume Master Key (VMK),
[Syng2007].

Thus, to decrypt the volume contents, the TPM MUST first decrypt the
SRK, which decrypts the VMK, which decrypts the FMVK, which is used 
to decrypt the volume contents (See Figure 1).

+---->---+---->---+--->---+----//-----//-----+
|  SRK   |  VRK   | FVEK  |  Volume Contents |
+---->---+---->---+--->---+----//-----//-----+
Figure 1: BitLocker Encrypt/Decrypt Operation  

As mentioned above, the TPM seals the VMK to certain predetermined 
configuration, which by default, includes the Core Root of Trust
 Measurement (CRTM), ROM code, Master Boot Block (MBR) code, the 
NTFS boot sector, and the NTFS boot block [Micro2008]. 
The digests for these configurations are taken and stored into 
Platform Configuration Registers (PCRS), (in particular, 
at the time when the VMK was created).




Mitchell                  Expires June 26, 2010                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft         Applying Forensic Science         January 2010  
                     to Trusted Enterprise Network  






Therefore, if for any reason the digests for these configurations
changed unexpectedly, the TPM will not unseal the VMK, and thus, the 
volume contents will not be decrypted. However, Windows Vista, and
Windows 7 (ultimate and enterprise versions), provide a data recovery
solution, which is particularly useful for Enterprises (and possible 
digital investigators). Thus, if for any reason, a particular condition 
exists,(such as BIOS upgrades, system board and/or hard drive change) 
that caused the digests for the predetermined configuration to alter,
the VMK will not be decrypted, and the platform would enter into
recovery mode. Here the platform would require the system administrator
(or possibly the investigator) to enter the recovery key, provided that
the key was created, and backed up during the BitLocker setup phase.


3.3. Signing Operation

According to [TCG2007] the TPM "tags some managed keys as signing only 
keys". Hence, these keys are not used for encrypting data. Instead, they
are used to compute the hash of the signed application data and/or 
messages, and then the private signing key is used to encrypt the hash 
value. The signing keys may be designated as migratable or non-
migratable keys. In general, all keys that are tagged as migratable can 
be transferred between TPM devices, whereas, the non-migratable are 
bound to a particular TPM device. An example of a non-migratable signing
key is the attestation identity key (AIK), which is "exclusively used to 
sign data originated by the TPM, (such as TPM capabilities and PCR
register values)" [TCG2007]. In essence, when application data or 
messages are digitally signed, it allows a third party, such as a 
digital investigator to ascertain the integrity, and possibly the data
origin [TCG2007]. For example, since the PCR values are signed by the 
AIK that resides in the tamper-evident TPM, the investigator can prove
the integrity of the PCR values, and by extension, the integrity of the
corresponding entries in the stored measurement log (SML).



3.4 Sealed-signing Operation

As part of the signing operation, a particular set of PCRs are 
collected and included in the message, as well as in the "computation 
of the signed message digest" [TCG2007]. This allows the investigator
to inspect the platform's configuration at the time when the signature
was created, as well as to provide stronger association of the possible
evidence, the TPM device, and the signatory.

4. The TPM's Integrity Measurement, Integrity Logging, and Integrity
   Reporting Mechanisms


4.1. Integrity Measurement

The integrity measurement is the process of obtaining measurements 
of events that might affect the trustworthiness of the platform. 
The root of trust for measurement (RTM) - which is a reliable
engine for computing measurements, uses the SHA-1 algorithm to 
compute the digests of the program codes or embedded data (otherwise
known as the measured values) before transferring execution control
to that code (or event). The measurement digests are then stored into
the shielded locations of the TPM (i.e. Platform configuration 
registers or PCRs) for later use, whereas the measured value itself
(i.e. program code or embedded data) may be stored into a log file,
called the stored measurement log (SML), or recalculated when desired 
[TCG2007].



4.2 Integrity Logging 

Integrity logging implies that the integrity measurements for the 
platform are often stored for future use. As suggested above, the 
measured value (or events) may be recalculated, however TCG (2007)
recommend that they be stored into the stored measurement log. 
According to Balfe et al (2005) the SML is synonymous to the Event Log.


4.3. Integrity Reporting 

Integrity reporting performs two main functions: (1) it uses the
TPM's protected capabilities to access and report the digests of
the measured values stored in the PCRs. (2) It uses the 
attestation identity key (AIK) to sign the PCRs, so that it can later
vouch for the integrity of the platform's measurements held inside
the PCRs [TCG2007].













Mitchell                  Expires June 26, 2010                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft         Applying Forensic Science         January 2010  
                     to Trusted Enterprise Network




Notably, using the TCG's attestation protocol, investigators can now 
retrieve one or more PCRs values (usually digitally signed by 
the private portion of the TPM's attestation identity key), and use
them as one of the comparators, to prove the trustworthiness of the 
digital evidence, such as whether the event logs or program
files was tampered with. Therefore, the classic Trojan Horse
argument that the evidence was planted by a virus or rootkits
might not work, especially since a correctly configured trusted
computing platform can provide provable statements that its
static data or program code (such as, the operating system program
files or DLLs) was not altered, as explained in [TCG2007] and 
[Mason2005].


5. Unique/Class Characteristics of Trusted Platform Module (TPM)

Using the Locard's exchange principle, [Casey2004] grouped
evidence into two main categories, i.e. (1) Class characteristics
and (2) Individual characteristics. In general terms, class
characteristics can be used to identify evidence based on common
traits that exist in similar digital objects, whereas, individual
characteristics can be used to identify evidence that are based
on the unique characteristics which distinctively identify a
digital object.


Trusted Platform Modules and its related technologies can provide
both class and individual characteristics, which digital
investigators can used to provide a stronger association between
the evidence, the crime scene, and the TPM instrument used to
commit the crime. For instance, the machines' fingerprints 
(collected by the integrity measurement collector or during 
attestation), provide class characteristics of a set of devices 
with common traits on the enterprise network.
Typically, networks that implements TCG's trusted network 
connect (TNC), or similar protocols, may remediate devices that
do not have these common traits. This allows the investigator
to identify the machine(s) that might have been involved within
the crime.

Conversely, if the digital evidence was sealed, signed-sealed
or bind(ed) using a non-migratable key, then the evidence is
cryptographically bound to a particular platform. 








Mitchell                  Expires June 26, 2010                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft         Applying Forensic Science           January 2010  
                     to Trusted Enterprise Network




Since the public portion of the non-migratable key is mathematically 
related [Anderson2008], using key verification techniques,
it is possible to use the public key as the unique characteristic
to prove whether the suspect's platform was involved within the 
crime. Especially, since only the device with the private portion
of the non-migratable key can decrypt any information or potential
evidence that was originally encrypted with the corresponding
public key. Therefore, if investigators can successfully identify
the device that can decrypt the message, they would be able to 
provide provable statements that the device was involved within
the crime. Furthermore, it is possible to make strong association
between the suspect, the crime scene, and the platform, especially
in cases where the enterprise uses a combination of user and machine
authentication scheme (i.e. TPM-based authentication), that 
irrevocably binds the user's credential or claimed identity to a
physical tamper-evident TPM device.



6. The Admissibility of Trusted Computing Digital Evidence

According to [Casey2004], "the US Federal Rules of Evidence
ACT (FRE), the UK Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) and Civil
Evidence Act, and similar rules of evidence in other countries were
established to help evaluate evidence". As a result, the US Federal 
Rule of Evidence was used to appraise the admissibility of TPM-
supported evidence. The US Federal Rule of Evidence was chosen
because the interpretations of its many rules are readily 
available in various literatures. The Federal Rules of Evidence Act
(FRE) deals primarily with the admissibility of evidence. It mandates
that before evidence is admitted, the court must determine if the
evidence is hearsay, if the copy of the evidence is acceptable
or the original is required, if evidence is reliable, as well as
if the evidence is authentic [Casey2004].



6.1. Hearsay

The Federal Rule Evidence 801(c) defines hearsay as "a statement,
other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial
or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter
asserted". As such, it is common for federal courts to evaluate
computer records on the basis of it being potential hearsay 
[USDOJ2002];[Nolan2005]. Interestingly, computer records can be
classified into two types:





Mitchell                  Expires June 26, 2010              [Page 8]

Internet-Draft         Applying Forensic Science         January 2010  
                     to Trusted Enterprise Network 




(i) Computer-stored records - which are records that "contain
writings of some person or persons and happen to be in electronic
form", (e.g. TPM-protected word-processing document, or TPM-
protected email messages).

(ii) Computer-generated records - which are records that
contains output of computer programs, "untouched by human hands"
(e.g. the TPM's integrity measurement logs, or attestation logs).
It is noteworthy that while computer-stored records can contain
hearsay, computer-generated records cannot [USDOJ2002] and [Nolan2005].

However, the business records exception or more precisely
Rule 803(6) is commonly used to except computer-stored records
from the Hearsay rule. Under Rule 803(6)
computer records that falls in the category of being
"regularly conducted business activities", such as daily
network monitoring logs are usually admissible in court
[USDOJ2002]. Furthermore, [USDOJ2002] and [Nolan2005], 
stated that all computer records must be proven to be
authentic and reliable. When computer-stored records contain
human statements, the human statements must be proven not to
be inadmissible hearsay.


Interestingly, the trusted platform module can store and\or
generate various records, which may fall into one or more
of the record categories (i.e. computer-stored or
computer-generated records). Therefore, in order to have
the TPM related evidence admitted in court, the hearsay
rules and/or the authenticity of the computer program may
be applicable.


6.2 Authentication

The Federal Rule Evidence 901(a) defines authentication "as a
condition precedent to admissibility, and is satisfied by
evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in
question is what its proponent claims" (cited in [Nolan2005]). 












Mitchell                  Expires June 26, 2010                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft         Applying Forensic Science         January 2010  
                     to Trusted Enterprise Network




For example, a witness who uses the TCG's 
attestation program to record the integrity measurement of
a remote computer and saved the result to a storage device
will need to authenticate that the evidence was recorded by him
using the attestation program, and that the evidence was saved
on the particular storage device [Nolan2005]. According to 
[USDOJ2002], the witness need not have special qualifications,
nor does he need to have programmed the computer himself, or even have
understanding of the maintenance and technical operation of computer to
authenticate the evidence.

In addition, it is imperative for the proponent to maintain a well
documented evidence chain of custody, showing an unquestionable
continuity of possession, particularly of who, where, what, why, when
and how the evidence was acquired, transferred, removed, analyzed,
stored and in some instances destroyed.

Failing to establish this unbroken trail of accountability could result
in the integrity of evidence (i.e. free from tampering) being loss and
therefore questionable by its opponents. However, as
stated by [USDOJ2002], "the mere possibility of tampering does not 
affect the authenticity of a computer record, but instead its assigned
weight".

Therefore, although it is possible to attest the integrity of TPM
related evidence, investigators should adhere to internationally
accepted procedures, such as those outlined in SWGDE, and IOCE,
including the maintenance of a proper chain of custody record.


6.3. Reliability

As mentioned before, witnesses need not be the person who
programmed the computer to authenticate the evidence. However,
the authenticity of computer-generated records may be reliant on
the reliability of the computer program that generates the record.
For instance, the TCG define trust as the "expectation that a
device will behave in a particular manner for a specific purpose"
[TCG2007]. It is also expected that trusted computing device
should be implemented in accordance to the TCG's specifications
[TCG2007]. 










Mitchell                  Expires June 26, 2010                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft         Applying Forensic Science         January 2010  
                     to Trusted Enterprise Network




As such, if the TCG's specifications (intentionally
or unintentionally) contain some security flaws (such as, earlier
TPM versions that are susceptible to PCR reset vulnerability), 
then those components would intrinsically be inaccurate. Also,
given the complexity of the design, it would be difficult, if
not impossible, to exhaustively verify every line of code.
As a result, it is possible for some computer programs to
contain serious programming errors. 

In general, the reliability of computer program, and 
particularly computer-generated records or evidence, can
be proven by showing that "users of the program actually do
rely on it on a regular basis, such as in the ordinary course
of business". For example, data collected by a third party 
through remote attestation that shows evidence of illicit
activities, (e.g. copyright violation), might be admissible
in court, if it could be proven that the third party relies on
the remote attestation program in his/her normal course of business.    
  

6.4. The Best Evidence Rule

According to [USDOJ2002] "the best evidence rule states that to
prove the content of writing, recording, photograph, the 'original'
writing, recording, or photograph is ordinarily required".


This rule could be problematic for digital evidence, in that, during 
the acquisition analysis phase it is possible for the evidence to be
damage or altered. For this reason, it is usually recommended to use
a bit-by-bit copy instead of the original. Therefore, even if the
copy gets damage, the original evidence would still be accessible.
Furthermore, under the Federal Rule of Evidence 1001(3) a bit-by-bit
copy of the evidence is regarded as being equivalent to the original,
and as such, the copy is usually admissible in court (cited in 
[USDOJ2002];[Nolan2005]).

However, it is not always possible to acquire a bit-by-bit copy of
the original, especially when strong encryption mechanisms are
used to protect the data. In such cases, how will the court proceed?
On one hand, data protection laws and regulations (such as, SOX,
HIPAA) are fueling the need for strong data protection mechanisms,
such as Full Drive Encryption (FDE), and Microsoft Bitlocker
encryption. However, on the other hand, strong encryption is long known
to be challenging for law enforcers, lawyers, and digital investigators
alike [Mason2005]. 





Mitchell                  Expires June 26, 2010                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft         Applying Forensic Science            January 2010  
                     to Trusted Enterprise Network




As pointed out in the introduction, the proliferation of TPM chips 
will make available to the general public (including potential
criminals) strong hardware-based encryption. It may become necessary 
to resort to live forensics, which has its own challenges.


7. TPM support for Live Forensic Analysis

Live forensic analysis involves probing a 'live' target system whilst
it is kept running. As such, the forensic technique relies on the
skillful analysis of the original source disks. It also relies on the
software found on the target system to perform the analysis
[Carrier2006]. There are two major implications for live forensic,
which are (i) the possible alternation of the original evidence.
In this regards, the Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence 
(SWGDE) recommended that "any action that has the potential to alter,
damage, or destroy any aspect of the original evidence must be perform-
ed by qualified persons in a forensically sound manner" (SWGDE, 1998).

(ii) As noted by [Carrier2006], "the only difference between live
and dead analysis is the reliability of the results." Since live
forensics relies on the platform applications, it is usually argued
that those applications could be subverted by means of hidden rootkits.
According to [Carrier2006] rootkits are "the most common source of
false data during live analysis".

In general, rootkits allows an attacker to gain access to the infected
system. It allows the attacker to hide his or her activity, by modify-
ing software programs, or by "inserting a filter in the data flow of a
computer". Essentially, rootkits allow a platform to lie about its
state, and thus, computer-generated records from such system could be
viewed by the opponents, as being suspicious or untrustworthy.

Interestingly, trusted computing platform may help to create a
trusted computing environment, one in which the platform will not be
permitted to lie about its state [TCG2007]. In an experiment 
conducted by [Sailer2004], it was shown that it is possible to use
TPM integrity measurement report to detect suspicious changes made to
the platform characteristics. However, subsequent experiments 
(conducted by the author), revealed that while it is possible to 
detect platform configurations changes, attritubing those changes to 
the actual perpetrator, such as a malicious person or rootkits
was not possible without examining other supporting evidence.

For instance, figure 2 shows the machine's PCR values (PCR#0 to PCR#3)
before its BIOS configurations were changed, and figure 3 shows the 
platform configuration after the BIOS configuration was changed. 
While we could easily identify that the hash value for PCR#1 had 
changed, we could not easily determine what caused the change to the 
platform. Essentially, the change could have resulted from a software 
and/or hardware upgrade, and not necessary from rootkits, as claimed
by [Sailer2004].

8. Security Considerations

The platform owner MUST have the requisite skills, resources,
and motivation to properly configure the trusted platform and/or 
the trusted computing environment. More specifically, it is assumed
that the Enterprise or platform owner has an efficient encryption key
management system in place, or similar systems (such as Windows key
restoration) to backup, restore, and/or manage its encryption keys.

The Enterprise SHOULD have adequate security mechanisms to protect
the integrity of the encryption key management system. This 
assumption is particularly important since a breach in the key
management system could nullify the effects of TPM data protection.

Finally, the Enterprise SHOULD enforced the necessary network policies
to protect against unauthorized changes to the TPM device
configuration, such as clearing, taking ownership, or turning off the
TPM protection.


9. IANA Considerations
