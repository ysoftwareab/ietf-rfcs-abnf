             Diffserv-Interconnection classes and practice
                 draft-ietf-tsvwg-diffserv-intercon-13

Abstract

   This document defines a limited common set of Diffserv PHBs and
   codepoints (DSCPs) to be applied at (inter)connections of two
   separately administered and operated networks, and explains how this
   approach can simplify network configuration and operation.  Many
   network providers operate MPLS using Treatment Aggregates for traffic
   marked with different Diffserv Per Hop Behaviors, and use MPLS for
   interconnection with other networks.  This document offers a simple
   interconnection approach that may simplify operation of Diffserv for
   network interconnection among providers that use MPLS and apply the
   Short-Pipe tunnel mode.  While motivated by the requirements of MPLS
   network operators that use Short-Pipe tunnels, this document is
   applicable to other networks, both MPLS and non-MPLS.

1.  Introduction

   Diffserv has been deployed in many networks; it provides
   differentiated traffic forwarding based on the Diffserv Codepoint
   (DSCP) field [RFC2474].  This document defines a set of common
   Diffserv classes (Per Hop Behaviors, PHBs) and code points for use at
   interconnection points to which and from which locally used classes
   and code points should be mapped.

   As described by section 2.3.4.2 of RFC2475, remarking of packets at
   domain boundaries is a Diffserv feature [RFC2475].  If traffic marked
   with unknown or unexpected DSCPs is received, RFC2474 recommends
   forwarding that traffic with default (best effort) treatment without
   changing the DSCP markings to better support incremental Diffserv

   deployment in existing networks as well as with routers that do not
   support Diffserv or are not configured to support it.  Many networks
   do not follow this recommendation, and instead remark unknown or
   unexpected DSCPs to zero upon receipt for default (best effort)
   forwarding in accordance with the guidance in RFC2475 [RFC2475] to
   ensure that appropriate DSCPs are used within a Diffserv domain.
   This draft is based on the latter approach, and defines additional
   DSCPs that are known and expected at network interconnection
   interfaces in order to reduce the amount of traffic whose DSCPs are
   remarked to zero.

   This document is motivated by requirements for IP network
   interconnection with Diffserv support among providers that operate
   Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) in their backbones, but is also
   applicable to other technologies.  The operational simplifications
   and methods in this document help align IP Diffserv functionality
   with MPLS limitations resulting from the widely deployed Short Pipe
   tunnel model for operation [RFC3270].  Further, limiting Diffserv to
   a small number of Treatment Aggregates can enable network traffic to
   leave a network with the DSCP value with which it was received, even
   if a different DSCP is used within the network, thus providing an
   opportunity to extend consistent Diffserv treatment across network
   boundaries.

   In isolation, use of a defined set of interconnection PHBs and DSCPs
   may appear to be additional effort for a network operator.  The
   primary offsetting benefit is that mapping from or to the
   interconnection PHBs and DSCPs is specified once for all of the
   interconnections to other networks that can use this approach.
   Absent this approach, the PHBs and DSCPs have to be negotiated and
   configured independently for each network interconnection, which has
   poor administrative and operational scaling properties.  Further,
   consistent end-to-end Diffserv treatment is more likely to result
   when an interconnection code point scheme is used because traffic is
   remarked to the same PHBs at all network interconnections.

   The interconnection approach described in this document (referred to
   as Diffserv-Intercon) uses a set of PHBs (mapped to four
   corresponding MPLS treatment aggregates) along with a set of
   interconnection DSCPs allowing straightforward rewriting to domain-
   internal DSCPs and defined DSCP markings for traffic forwarded to
   interconnected domains.  The solution described here can be used in
   other contexts benefitting from a defined Diffserv interconnection
   interface.

   The basic idea is that traffic sent with a Diffserv-Interconnect PHB
   and DSCP is restored to that PHB and DSCP at each network
   interconnection, even though a different PHB and DSCP may be used by

   each network involved.  The key requirement is that the network
   ingress interconnect DSCP be restored at network egress, and a key
   observation is that this is only feasible in general for a small
   number of DSCPs.  Traffic sent with other DSCPs can be remarked to an
   interconnect DSCP or dealt with via additional agreement(s) among the
   operators of the interconnected networks; use of the MPLS Short Pipe
   model favors remarking unexpected DSCPs to zero in the absence of
   additional agreement(s), as explained further in this document.

   In addition to the common interconnecting PHBs and DSCPs,
   interconnecting operators need to further agree on the tunneling
   technology used for interconnection (e.g., MPLS, if used) and control
   or mitigate the impacts of tunneling on reliability and MTU.

1.1.  Related work

   In addition to the activities that triggered this work, there are
   additional RFCs and Internet-drafts that may benefit from an
   interconnection PHB and DSCP scheme.  RFC5160 suggests Meta-QoS-
   Classes to help enabling deployment of standardized end to end QoS
   classes [RFC5160].  The Diffserv-Intercon class- and codepoint scheme
   is intended to complement that work (e.g. by enabling a defined set
   of interconnection DSCPs and PHBs).

   BGP signaling Class of Service at interconnection interfaces by BGP
   [I-D.knoll-idr-cos-interconnect], [ID.ietf-idr-sla] is complementary
   to Diffserv-Intercon.  These two BGP documents focus on exchanging
   SLA and traffic conditioning parameters and assume that common PHBs
   identified by the signaled DSCPs have been established (e.g., via use
   of the Diffserv-Intercon DSCPs) prior to BGP signaling of PHB id
   codes.

1.2.  Applicability Statement

   This document is applicable to use of Differentiated Services for
   interconnection traffic between networks, and is particularly suited
   to interconnection of MPLS-based networks that use MPLS Short-pipe
   tunnels.  This document is also applicable to other network
   technologies, but it is not intended for use within an individual
   network, where the approach specified in RFC5127 [RFC5127] is among
   the possible alternatives; see Section 3 for further discussion.

   The Diffserv-Intercon approach described in this document simplifies
   IP based interconnection to domains operating the MPLS Short Pipe
   model for IP traffic, both terminating within the domain and
   transiting onward to another domain.  Transiting traffic is received
   and sent with the same PHB and DSCP.  Terminating traffic maintains
   the PHB with which it was received, however the DSCP may change.

Internet-Draft              Diffserv-Intercon              December 2016


   Diffserv-Intercon is also applicable to the Pipe tunneling model
   [RFC2983], [RFC3270], but it is not applicable to the Uniform
   tunneling model [RFC2983], [RFC3270].

   The Diffserv-Intercon approach defines a set of four PHBs for support
   at interconnections (or network boundaries in general).
   Corresponding DSCPs for use at an interconnection interface are
   added.  Diffserv-intercon allows for a simple mapping of PHBs and
   DSCPs to MPLS Treatment Aggregates.  It is extensible by IETF
   standardisation and this allows to add a few more PHBs and DSCPs to
   the Diffserv-intercon scheme.  Coding space for private
   interconnection agreements or provider internal services is left too.

1.3.  Document Organization

   This document is organized as follows: section 2 reviews the MPLS
   Short Pipe tunnel model for Diffserv Tunnels [RFC3270], because
   effective support for that model is a crucial goal of Diffserv-
   Intercon.  Section 3 provides background on RFC5127's approach to
   traffic class aggregation within a Diffserv network domain and
   contrasts it with the Diffserv-Intercon approach.  Section 4
   introduces Diffserv-Interconnection Treatment Aggregates, along with
   the PHBs and DSCPs that they use, and explains how other PHBs (and
   associated DSCPs) may be mapped to these Treatment Aggregates.
   Section 4 also discusses treatment of IP traffic, MPLS VPN Diffserv
   considerations and handling of high-priority Network Management
   traffic.  Appendix A describes how the MPLS Short Pipe model
   (penultimate hop popping) impacts DSCP marking for IP
   interconnections.

2.  MPLS and the Short Pipe tunnel model

   This section provides a summary of the implications of the MPLS Short
   Pipe tunnels, and in particular their use of use of PHP (Penultimate
   Hop Popping, see RFC3270) on the Diffserv tunnel framework described
   in RFC2983.  The Pipe and Uniform models for Differentiated Services
   and Tunnels are defined in [RFC2983].  RFC3270 adds the Short Pipe
   model in order to support MPLS penultimate hop popping (PHP) of
   Labels, primarily for MPLS-based IP tunnels and VPNs.  The Short Pipe
   model and PHP have subsequently become popular with network providers
   that operate MPLS networks and are now widely used to transport
   unencapsulated IP traffic.  This has important implications for
   Diffserv functionality in MPLS networks.

   RFC2474's recommendation to forward traffic with unrecognized DSCPs
   with Default (best effort) service without rewriting the DSCP has not
   been widely deployed in practice.  Network operation and management
   are simplified when there is a 1-1 match between the DSCP marked on



Geib & Black              Expires June 9, 2017                  [Page 5]


Internet-Draft              Diffserv-Intercon              December 2016


   the packet and the forwarding treatment (PHB) applied by network
   nodes.  When this is done, CS0 (the all-zero DSCP) is the only DSCP
   used for Default forwarding of best effort traffic, and a common
   practice is to remark to CS0 any traffic received with unrecognized
   or unsupported DSCPs at network edges.

   MPLS networks are more subtle in this regard, as it is possible to
   encode the provider's DSCP in the MPLS Traffic Class (TC) field and
   allow that to differ from the PHB indicated by the DSCP in the MPLS-
   encapsulated IP packet.  If the MPLS label with the provider's TC
   field is present at all hops within the provider network, this
   approach would allow an unrecognized DSCP to be carried edge-to-edge
   over an MPLS network, because the effective DSCP used by the
   provider's MPLS network would be encoded in the MPLS label TC field
   (and also carried edge-to-edge).  Unfortunately this is only true for
   the Pipe tunnel model.

   The Short Pipe tunnel model and PHP behave differently because PHP
   removes and discards the MPLS provider label carrying the provider's
   TC field before the traffic exits the provider's network.  That
   discard occurs one hop upstream of the MPLS tunnel endpoint (which is
   usually at the network edge), resulting in no provider TC info being
   available at tunnel egress.  To ensure consistent handling of traffic
   at the tunnel egress, the DSCP field in the MPLS-encapsulated IP
   header has to contain a DSCP that is valid for the provider's
   network, so that IP header cannot be used to carry a different DSCP
   edge-to-edge.  See Appendix A for a more detailed discussion.

3.  Relationship to RFC5127

   This document draws heavily upon RFC5127's approach to aggregation of
   Diffserv traffic classes for use within a network, but there are
   important differences caused by characteristics of network
   interconnects that differ from links within a network.

3.1.  RFC5127 Background

   Many providers operate MPLS-based backbones that employ backbone
   traffic engineering to ensure that if a major link, switch, or router
   fails, the result will be a routed network that continues to
   function.  Based on that foundation, [RFC5127] introduced the concept
   of Diffserv Treatment Aggregates, which enable traffic marked with
   multiple DSCPs to be forwarded in a single MPLS Traffic Class (TC)
   based on robust provider backbone traffic engineering.  This enables
   differentiated forwarding behaviors within a domain in a fashion that
   does not consume a large number of MPLS Traffic Classes.

Internet-Draft              Diffserv-Intercon              December 2016


   RFC5127 provides an example aggregation of Diffserv service classes
   into 4 Treatment Aggregates.  A small number of aggregates are used
   because:

   o  The available coding space for carrying Traffic Class information
      (e.g., Diffserv PHB) in MPLS (and Ethernet) is only 3 bits in
      size, and is intended for more than just Diffserv purposes (see
      e.g.  [RFC5129]).

   o  The common interconnection DSCPs ought not to use all 8 possible
      values.  This leaves space for future standards, for private
      bilateral agreements and for local use PHBs and DSCPs.

   o  Migrations from one Diffserv code point scheme to a different one
      is another possible application of otherwise unused DSCPs.

3.2.  Differences from RFC5127

   Like RFC5127, this document also uses four traffic aggregates, but
   differs from RFC5127 in some important ways:

   o  It follows RFC2475 in allowing the DSCPs used within a network to
      differ from those to exchange traffic with other networks (at
      network edges), but provides support to restore ingress DSCP
      values if one of the recommended interconnect DSCPs in this draft
      is used.  This results in DSCP remarking at both network ingress
      and network egress, and this draft assumes that such remarking at
      network edges is possible for all interface types.

   o  Diffserv-Intercon suggests limiting the number of interconnection
      PHBs per Treatment Aggregate to the minimum required.  As further
      discussed below, the number of PHBs per Treatment Aggreagate is no
      more than two.  When two PHBs are specified for a Diffserv-
      Intercon treatment aggregate, the expectation is that the provider
      network supports DSCPs for both PHBs, but uses a single MPLS TC
      for the Treatment Aggregate that contains the two PHBs.

   o  Diffserv-Intercon suggests mapping other PHBs and DSCPs into the
      interconnection Treatment Aggregates as further discussed below.

   o  Diffserv-Intercon treats network control traffic as a special
      case.  Within a provider's network, the CS6 DSCP is used for local
      network control traffic (routing protocols and OAM traffic that is
      essential to network operation administration, control and
      management) that may be destined for any node within the network.
      In contrast, network control traffic exchanged between networks
      (e.g., BGP) usually terminates at or close to a network edge, and
      is not forwarded through the network because it is not part of

      internal routing or OAM for the receiving network.  In addition,
      such traffic is unlikely to be covered by standard interconnection
      agreements; rather, it is more likely to be specifically
      configured (e.g., most networks impose restrictions on use of BGP
      with other networks for obvious reasons).  See Section 4.2 for
      further discussion.

   o  Because RFC5127 used a Treatment Aggregate for network control
      traffic, Diffserv-Intercon can instead define a fourth traffic
      aggregate to be defined for use at network interconnections
      instead of the Network Control aggregate in RFC5127.  Network
      Control traffic may still be exchanged across network
      interconnections as further discussed in Section 4.2.  Diffserv-
      Intercon uses this fourth traffic aggregate for VoIP traffic,
      where network-provided service differentiation is crucial, as even
      minor glitches are immediately apparent to the humans involved in
      the conversation.

4.  The Diffserv-Intercon Interconnection Classes

   At an interconnection, the networks involved need to agree on the
   PHBs used for interconnection and the specific DSCP for each PHB.
   This document defines a set of 4 interconnection Treatment Aggregates
   with well-defined DSCPs to be aggregated by them.  A sending party
   remarks DSCPs from internal schemes to the interconnection code
   points.  The receiving party remarks DSCPs to their internal scheme.
   The interconnect SLA defines the set of DSCPs and PHBs supported
   across the two interconnected domains and the treatment of PHBs and
   DSCPs that are not recognized by the receiving domain.

   Similar approaches that use of a small number of traffic aggregates
   (including recognition of the importance of VoIP traffic) have been
   taken in related standards and recommendations from outside the IETF,
   e.g., Y.1566 [Y.1566], GSMA IR.34 [IR.34]and MEF23.1 [MEF23.1].

   The list of the four Diffserv-Interconnect traffic aggregates
   follows, highlighting differences from RFC5127 and suggesting
   mappings for all RFC4594 traffic classes to Diffserv-Intercon
   Treatment Aggregates:

    Telephony Service Treatment Aggregate:  PHB EF, DSCP 101 110 and PHB
           VOICE-ADMIT, DSCP 101 100, see [RFC3246],[RFC4594]and
           [RFC5865].  This Treatment Aggregate corresponds to RFC5127's
           real time Treatment Aggregate definition regarding the
           queuing (both delay and jitter should be minimized), but this
           aggregate is restricted to transport Telephony Service Class
           traffic in the sense of RFC4594 [RFC4594].

Internet-Draft              Diffserv-Intercon              December 2016


   Bulk Real-Time Treatment Aggregate:  This Treatment Aggregate is
           designed to transport PHB AF41, DSCP 100 010 (the other AF4
           PHB group PHBs and DSCPs may be used for future extension of
           the set of DSCPs carried by this Treatment Aggregate).  This
           Treatment Aggregate is intended for Diffserv-Intercon network
           interconnection of the portions of RFC5127's Real Time
           Treatment Aggregate, that consume significant bandwidth.
           This traffic is expected to consist of the RFC4594 classes
           Broadcast Video, Real-Time Interactive and Multimedia
           Conferencing.  This treatment aggregate should be configured
           with a rate queue (consistent with RFC4594's recommendation
           for the transported traffic classes).  By comparison to
           RFC5127, the number of DSCPs has been reduced to one
           (initially).  The AF42 and AF43 PHBs could be added if there
           is a need for three-color marked Multimedia.

   Assured Elastic Treatment Aggregate  This Treatment Aggregate
           consists of PHBs AF31 and AF32 ( i.e., DSCPs 011 010 and 011
           100).  By comparison to RFC5127, the number of DSCPs has been
           reduced to two.  This document suggests to transport
           signaling marked by AF31 (e.g. as recommended by GSMA IR.34
           [IR.34]).  AF33 is reserved for extension of PHBs to be
           aggregated by this TA.  For Diffserv-Intercon network
           interconnection, the following RFC4594 service classes should
           be mapped to the Assured Elastic Treatment Aggregate: the
           Signaling Service Class (being marked for lowest loss
           probability), Multimedia Streaming Service Class, the Low-
           Latency Data Service Class and the High-Throughput Data
           Service Class.

   Default / Elastic Treatment Aggregate:   transports the default PHB,
           CS0 with DSCP 000 000.  RFC5127 example refers to this
           Treatment Aggregate as Aggregate Elastic.  An important
           difference from RFC5127 is that any traffic with unrecognized
           or unsupported DSCPs may be remarked to this DSCP.  For
           Diffserv-Intercon network interconnection, the RFC4594
           standard service class and Low-priority Data service class
           should be mapped to this Treatment Aggregate.  This document
           does not specify an interconnection class for RFC4594 Low-
           priority data.  This data may be forwarded by a Lower Effort
           PHB in one domain (like the PHB proposed by Informational
           [RFC3662]), but using the methods specified in this document
           will be remarked with DSCP CS0 at a Diffserv-Intercon network
           interconnection.  This has the effect that Low-priority data
           is treated the same as data sent using the default class.
           (Note: In a network that implements RFC2474, Low-priority

Internet-Draft              Diffserv-Intercon              December 2016


   RFC2475 states that Ingress nodes must condition all inbound traffic
   to ensure that the DS codepoints are acceptable; packets found to
   have unacceptable codepoints must either be discarded or must have
   their DS codepoints modified to acceptable values before being
   forwarded.  For example, an ingress node receiving traffic from a
   domain with which no enhanced service agreement exists may reset the
   DS codepoint to CS0.  As a consequence, an interconnect SLA needs to
   specify not only the treatment of traffic that arrives with a
   supported interconnect DSCP, but also the treatment of traffic that
   arrives with unsupported or unexpected DSCPs; remarking to CS0 is a
   widely deployed behavior.

4.1.  Diffserv-Intercon Example

   The overall approach to DSCP marking at network interconnections is
   illustrated by the following example.  Provider O and provider W are
   peered with provider T.  They have agreed upon a Diffserv
   interconnection SLA.

   Traffic of provider O terminates within provider T's network, while
   provider W's traffic transits through the network of provider T to
   provider F.  This example assumes that all providers use their own
   internal PHB and codepoint (DSCP) that correspond to the AF31 PHB in
   the Diffserv-Intercon Assured Elastic Treatment Aggregate (AF21 and
   CS2 are used in the example).

   Providers only need to deploy mappings of internal DSCPs to/from
   Diffserv-Intercon DSCPs in order to exchange traffic using the
   desired PHBs.  In the example, provider O has decided that the
   properties of his internal class AF21 are best met by the Diffserv-
   Intercon Assured Elastic Treatment Aggregate, PHB AF31.  At the
   outgoing peering interface connecting provider O with provider T the
   former's peering router remarks AF21 traffic to AF31.  The domain
   internal PHB of provider T meeting the requirement of Diffserv-
   Intercon Assured Elastic Treatment Aggregate are from AF2x PHB group.
   Hence AF31 traffic received at the interconnection with provider T is
   remarked to AF21 by the peering router of domain T, and domain T has
   chosen to use MPLS Traffic Class value 2 for this aggregate.  At the
   penultimate MPLS node, the top MPLS label is removed and exposes the
   IP header marked by the DSCP which has been set at the network
   ingress.  The peering router connecting domain T with domain F
   classifies the packet by its domain-T-internal DSCP AF21.  As the
   packet leaves domain T on the interface to domain F, this causes the
   packet's DSCP to be remarked to AF31.  The peering router of domain F
   classifies the packet for domain-F-internal PHB AF11, as this is the
   PHB with properties matching Diffserv-Intercon's Assured Elastic
   Treatment Aggregate.

   This example can be extended.  The figure shows Provider-W using CS2
   for traffic that corresponds to Diffserv-Intercon Assured Elastic
   Treatment Aggregate PHB AF31; that traffic is mapped to AF31 at the
   Diffserv-Intercon interconnection to Provider-T.  In addition,
   suppose that Provider-O supports a PHB marked by AF22 and this PHB is
   supposed to obtain Diffserv transport within Provider-T domain.  Then
   Provider-O will remark it with DSCP AF32 for interconnection to
   Provider-T.

   Finally suppose that Provider-W supports CS3 for internal use only.
   Then no Diffserv- Intercon DSCP mapping needs to be configured at the
   peering router.  Traffic, sent by Provider-W to Provider-T marked by
   CS3 due to a misconfiguration may be remarked to CS0 by Provider-T.

4.2.  End-to-end PHB and DSCP Transparency

   This section briefly discusses end-to-end Diffserv approaches related
   to the Uniform, Pipe and Short Pipe tunnel models ([RFC2983],
   [RFC3270]), when used edge-to-edge in a network.

   o  With the Uniform model, neither the DCSP nor the PHB change.  This
      implies that a network management packet received with a CS6 DSCP
      would be forwarded with an MPLS Traffic Class corresponding to
      CS6.  The uniform model is outside the scope of this document.

Internet-Draft              Diffserv-Intercon              December 2016


   o  With the Pipe model, the inner tunnel DCSP remains unchanged, but
      an outer tunnel DSCP and the PHB could changed.  For example a
      packet received with a (network specific) CS1 DSCP would be
      transported by default PHB and if MPLS is applicable, forwarded
      with an MPLS Traffic Class corresponding to Default PHB.  The CS1
      DSCP is not rewritten.  Transport of a large variety (much greater
      than 4) DSCPs may be required across an interconnected network
      operating MPLS Short pipe transport for IP traffic.  In that case,
      a tunnel based on the Pipe model is among the possible approaches.
      The Pipe model is outside the scope of this document.

   o  With the Short Pipe model, the DCSP likely changes and the PHB
      might change.  This document describes a method to simplify
      Diffserv network interconnection when a DSCP rewrite can't be
      avoided.

4.3.  Treatment of Network Control traffic at carrier interconnection
      interfaces

   As specified by RFC4594, section 3.2, Network Control (NC) traffic
   marked by CS6 is expected at some interconnection interfaces.  This
   document does not change RFC4594, but observes that network control
   traffic received at network ingress is generally different from
   network control traffic within a network that is the primary use of
   CS6 envisioned by RFC4594.  A specific example is that some CS6
   traffic exchanged across carrier interconnections is terminated at
   the network ingress node, e.g. when BGP is used between the two
   routers on opposite ends of an interconnection link; in this case the
   operators would enter into a bilateral agreement to use CS6 for that
   BGP traffic.

   The end-to-end discussion in the previous section (4.2) is generally
   inapplicable to network control traffic - network control traffic is
   generally intended to control a network, not be transported between
   networks.  One exception is that network control traffic makes sense
   for a purchased transit agreement, and preservation of the CS6 DSCP
   marking for network control traffic that is transited is reasonable
   in some cases, although it is generally inappropriate to use CS6 for
   forwarding that traffic within the network that provides transit.
   Use of an IP tunnel is suggested in order to conceal the CS6 markings
   on transiting network control traffic from the network that provides
   the transit.  In this case, Pipe model for Diffserv tunneling is
   used.

   If the MPLS Short Pipe model is deployed for unencapsulated IPv4
   traffic, an IP network provider should limit access to the CS6 and
   CS7 DSCPs so that they are only used for network control traffic for
   the provider's own network.

   Interconnecting carriers should specify treatment of CS6 marked
   traffic received at a carrier interconnection which is to be
   forwarded beyond the ingress node.  An SLA covering the following
   cases is recommended when a provider wishes to send CS6 marked
   traffic across an interconnection link and that traffic's destination
   is beyond the interconnected ingress node:

   o  classification of traffic that is network control traffic for both
      domains.  This traffic should be classified and marked for the CS6
      DSCP.

   o  classification of traffic that is network control traffic for the
      sending domain only.  This traffic should be forwarded with a PHB
      that is appropriate for the NC service class [RFC4594], e.g.  AF31
      as specified by this document.  As an example GSMA IR.34
      recommends an Interactive class / AF31 to carry SIP and DIAMETER
      traffic.  While this is service control traffic of high importance
      to interconnected Mobile Network Operators, it is certainly not
      Network Control traffic for a fixed network providing transit
      among such operators, and hence should not receive CS6 treatment
      in such a transit network.

   o  any other CS6 marked traffic should be remarked or dropped.

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   DSCP marks expose additional traffic classification information at
   network interconnections by comparison to use of zero DSCPs for all
   interconnect traffic - if that traffic classification info is
   sensitive, remarking DSCPs to zero to hide the classification is the
   countermeasure, at the cost of loss of Diffserv info and
   differentiated traffic handling on the interconnect.

Appendix A.  Appendix A The MPLS Short Pipe Model and IP traffic

   The MPLS Short Pipe Model (or penultimate Hop Label Popping) is
   widely deployed in carrier networks.  If unencapsulated IP traffic is
   transported using MPLS Short Pipe, IP headers appear inside the last

   section of the MPLS domain.  This impacts the number of PHBs and
   DSCPs that a network provider can reasonably support.  See Figure 2
   (below) for an example.

   For encapsulated IP traffic, only the outer tunnel header is relevant
   for forwarding.  If the tunnel does not terminate within the MPLS
   network section, only the outer tunnel DSCP is involved, as the inner
   DSCP does not affect forwarding behavior; in this case all DSCPs
   could be used in the inner IP header without affecting network
   behavior based on the outer MPLS header.  Here the Pipe model
   applies.

   Layer 2 and Layer 3 VPN traffic all use an additional MPLS label; in
   this case, the MPLS tunnel follows the Pipe model.  Classification
   and queuing within an MPLS network is always based on an MPLS label,
   as opposed to the outer IP header.

   Carriers often select PHBs and DSCP without regard to
   interconnection.  As a result PHBs and DSCPs typically differ between
   network carriers.  With the exception of best effort traffic, a DSCP
   change should be expected at an interconnection at least for
   unencapsulated IP traffic, even if the PHB is suitably mapped by the
   carriers involved.

   Although RFC3270 suggests that the Short Pipe Model is only
   applicable to VPNs, current networks also use it to transport non-
   tunneled IPv4 traffic.  This is shown in figure 2 where Diffserv-
   Intercon is not used, resulting in exposure of the internal DSCPs of
   the upstream network to the downstream network across the
   interconnection.

   deploys per-peer PHB and DSCP mapping schemes.

   If Diffserv-Intercon is applied DSCPs for traffic transiting the
   domain can be mapped from and remapped to an original DSCP.  This is
   shown in figure 3.  Internal traffic may continue to use internal
   DSCPs (e.g, DSCP_d) and they may also be used between a carrier and
   its direct customers.
