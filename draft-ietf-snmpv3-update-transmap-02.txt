1.  Introduction

   The SNMP Management Framework at the time of this writing consists of
   five major components:

        -    An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

        -    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for
             the purpose of management.  The first version of this
             Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1
             and described in STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC
             1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215 [RFC1215].  The second version,
             called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578],
             STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

        -    Message protocols for transferring management information.
             The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called
             SNMPv1 and is described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A
             second version of the SNMP message protocol, which is not
             an Internet standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and
             is described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901] and this document.  The
             third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and
             described in this document, RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574
             [RFC2574].

        -    Protocol operations for accessing management information.
             The first set of protocol operations and associated PDU
             formats is described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A
             second set of protocol operations and associated PDU
             formats is described RFC -PROTO [RFC-PROTO].

        -    A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
             [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism
             described in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

        A more detailed introduction to the SNMP Management Framework at
        the time of this writing can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

        Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
        termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
        MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

        This document, Transport Mappings for the Simple Network
        Management Protocol, defines how the management protocol [RFC-
        PROTO] may be carried over a variety of protocol suites.  It is
        the purpose of this document to define how the SNMP maps onto an
        initial set of transport domains.  Other mappings may be defined
        in the future.

        Although several mappings are defined, the mapping onto UDP over
        IPv4 is the preferred mapping.  As such, to provide for the
        greatest level of interoperability, systems which choose to
        deploy other mappings should also provide for proxy service to
        the UDP over IPv4 mapping.

3.  SNMP over UDP over IPv4

   This is the preferred transport mapping.

3.1.  Serialization

   Each instance of a message is serialized (i.e., encoded according to
   the convention of [ASN1]) onto a single UDP [RFC768] over IPv4
   [RFC791] datagram, using the algorithm specified in Section 8.

Internet Draft         Transport Mappings for SNMP          3 April 2000


3.2.  Well-known Values

   It is suggested that administrators configure their SNMP entities
   supporting command responder applications to listen on UDP port 161.
   Further, it is suggested that SNMP entities supporting notification
   receiver applications be configured to listen on UDP port 162.

   When an SNMP entity uses this transport mapping, it must be capable
   of accepting messages up to and including 484 octets in size.  It is
   recommended that implementations be capable of accepting messages of
   up to 1472 octets in size.  Implementation of larger values is
   encouraged whenever possible.

4.  SNMP over OSI

   This is an optional transport mapping.

4.1.  Serialization

   Each instance of a message is serialized onto a single TSDU [IS8072]
   [IS8072A] for the OSI Connectionless-mode Transport Service (CLTS),
   using the algorithm specified in Section 8.

4.2.  Well-known Values

   It is suggested that administrators configure their SNMP entities
   supporting command responder applications to listen on transport
   selector "snmp-l" (which consists of six ASCII characters), when
   using a CL-mode network service to realize the CLTS.  Further, it is
   suggested that SNMP entities supporting notification receiver
   applications be configured to listen on transport selector "snmpt-l"
   (which consists of seven ASCII characters, six letters and a hyphen)
   when using a CL-mode network service to realize the CLTS.  Similarly,
   when using a CO-mode network service to realize the CLTS, the
   suggested transport selectors are "snmp-o" and "snmpt-o", for command
   responders and notification receivers, respectively.

   When an SNMP entity uses this transport mapping, it must be capable
   of accepting messages that are at least 484 octets in size.
   Implementation of larger values is encouraged whenever possible.

5.  SNMP over DDP

   This is an optional transport mapping.

Internet Draft         Transport Mappings for SNMP          3 April 2000



5.1.  Serialization

   Each  instance  of a message is serialized onto a single DDP datagram
   [APPLETALK], using the algorithm specified in Section 8.

5.2.  Well-known Values

   SNMP messages are sent using DDP protocol type 8.  SNMP entities
   supporting command responder applications listen on DDP socket number
   8, while SNMP entities supporting notification receiver applications
   listen on DDP socket number 9.

   Administrators must configure their SNMP entities supporting command
   responder applications to use NBP type "SNMP Agent" (which consists
   of ten ASCII while those supporting notification receiver
   applications must be configured to use NBP type "SNMP Trap Handler"
   (which consists of seventeen ASCII characters).

   The NBP name for SNMP entities supporting command responders and
   notification receivers should be stable - NBP names should not change
   any more often than the IP address of a typical TCP/IP node.  It is
   suggested that the NBP name be stored in some form of stable storage.

   When an SNMP entity uses this transport mapping, it must be capable
   of accepting messages that are at least 484 octets in size.
   Implementation of larger values is encouraged whenever possible.

5.3.  Discussion of AppleTalk Addressing

   The AppleTalk protocol suite has certain features not manifest in the
   TCP/IP suite.  AppleTalk's naming strategy and the dynamic nature of
   address assignment can cause problems for SNMP entities that wish to
   manage AppleTalk networks.  TCP/IP nodes have an associated IP
   address which distinguishes each from the other.  In contrast,
   AppleTalk nodes generally have no such characteristic.  The network-
   level address, while often relatively stable, can change at every
   reboot (or more frequently).

   Thus, when SNMP is mapped over DDP, nodes are identified by a "name",
   rather than by an "address".  Hence, all AppleTalk nodes that
   implement this mapping are required to respond to NBP lookups and
   confirms (e.g., implement the NBP protocol stub), which guarantees
   that a mapping from NBP name to DDP address will be possible.

   In determining the SNMP identity to register for an SNMP entity, it
   is suggested that the SNMP identity be a name which is associated
   with other network services offered by the machine.

Internet Draft         Transport Mappings for SNMP          3 April 2000


   NBP lookups, which are used to map NBP names into DDP addresses, can
   cause large amounts of network traffic as well as consume CPU
   resources.  It is also the case that the ability to perform an NBP
   lookup is sensitive to certain network disruptions (such as zone
   table inconsistencies) which would not prevent direct AppleTalk
   communications between two SNMP entities.

   Thus, it is recommended that NBP lookups be used infrequently,
   primarily to create a cache of name-to-address mappings.  These
   cached mappings should then be used for any further SNMP traffic.  It
   is recommended that SNMP entities supporting command generator
   applications should maintain this cache between reboots.  This
   caching can help minimize network traffic, reduce CPU load on the
   network, and allow for (some amount of) network trouble shooting when
   the basic name-to-address translation mechanism is broken.

5.3.1.  How to Acquire NBP names

   An SNMP entity supporting command generator applications may have a
   pre-configured list of names of "known" SNMP entities supporting
   command responder applications.  Similarly, an SNMP entity supporting
   command generator or notification receiver applications might
   interact with an operator.  Finally, an SNMP entity supporting
   command generator or notification receiver applications might
   communicate with all SNMP entities supporting command responder or
   notification originator applications in a set of zones or networks.

5.3.2.  When to Turn NBP names into DDP addresses

   When an SNMP entity uses a cache entry to address an SNMP packet, it
   should attempt to confirm the validity mapping, if the mapping hasn't
   been confirmed within the last T1 seconds.  This cache entry
   lifetime, T1, has a minimum, default value of 60 seconds, and should
   be configurable.

   An SNMP entity supporting a command generator application may decide
   to prime its cache of names prior to actually communicating with
   another SNMP entity.  In general, it is expected that such an entity
   may want to keep certain mappings "more current" than other mappings,
   e.g., those nodes which represent the network infrastructure (e.g.,
   routers) may be deemed "more important".

   Note that an SNMP entity supporting command generator applications
   should not prime its entire cache upon initialization - rather, it
   should attempt resolutions over an extended period of time (perhaps
   in some pre- determined or configured priority order).  Each of these
   resolutions might, in fact, be a wildcard lookup in a given zone.

Internet Draft         Transport Mappings for SNMP          3 April 2000


   An SNMP entity supporting command responder applications must never
   prime its cache.  When generating a response, such an entity does not
   need to confirm a cache entry.  An SNMP entity supporting
   notification originator applications should do NBP lookups (or
   confirms) only when it needs to send an SNMP trap or inform.

5.3.3.  How to Turn NBP names into DDP addresses

   If the only piece of information available is the NBP name, then an
   NBP lookup should be performed to turn that name into a DDP address.
   However, if there is a piece of stale information, it can be used as
   a hint to perform an NBP confirm (which sends a unicast to the
   network address which is presumed to be the target of the name
   lookup) to see if the stale information is, in fact, still valid.

   An NBP name to DDP address mapping can also be confirmed implicitly
   using only SNMP transactions.  For example, an SNMP entity acting
   supporting command generator applications issuing a retrieval
   operation could also retrieve the relevant objects from the NBP group
   [RFC1742] for the SNMP entity supporting the command responder
   application.  This information can then be correlated with the source
   DDP address of the response.

5.3.4.  What if NBP is broken

   Under some circumstances, there may be connectivity between two SNMP
   entities, but the NBP mapping machinery may be broken, e.g.,

   o    the NBP FwdReq (forward NBP lookup onto local attached network)
        mechanism might be broken at a router on the other entity's
        network; or,

   o    the NBP BrRq (NBP broadcast request) mechanism might be broken
        at a router on the entity's own network; or,

   o    NBP might be broken on the other entity's node.

   An SNMP entity supporting command generator applications which is
   dedicated to AppleTalk management might choose to alleviate some of
   these failures by directly implementing the router portion of NBP.
   For example, such an entity might already know all the zones on the
   AppleTalk internet and the networks on which each zone appears.
   Given an NBP lookup which fails, the entity could send an NBP FwdReq
   to the network in which the SNMP entity supporting the command
   responder or notification originator application was last located.
   If that failed, the station could then send an NBP LkUp (NBP lookup
   packet) as a directed (DDP) multicast to each network number on that
   network.  Of the above (single) failures, this combined approach will

   solve the case where either the local router's BrRq-to-FwdReq
   mechanism is broken or the remote router's FwdReq-to-LkUp mechanism
   is broken.

6.  SNMP over IPX

   This is an optional transport mapping.

6.1.  Serialization

   Each instance of a message is serialized onto a single IPX datagram
   [NOVELL], using the algorithm specified in Section 8.

6.2.  Well-known Values

   SNMP messages are sent using IPX packet type 4 (i.e., Packet Exchange
   Protocol).

   It is suggested that administrators configure their SNMP entities
   supporting command responder applications to listen on IPX socket
   36879 (900f hexadecimal).  Further, it is suggested that those
   supporting notification receiver applications be configured to listen
   on IPX socket 36880 (9010 hexadecimal).

   When an SNMP entity uses this transport mapping, it must be capable
   of accepting messages that are at least 546 octets in size.
   Implementation of larger values is encouraged whenever possible.

7.  Proxy to SNMPv1

   Historically, in order to support proxy to SNMPv1, as defined in
   [RFC2576], it was deemed useful to define a transport domain,
   rfc1157Domain, which indicates the transport mapping for SNMP
   messages as defined in [RFC1157].  Subsequently, this transport
   domain has proven useful in non-proxy situations.

8.  Serialization using the Basic Encoding Rules

   When the Basic Encoding Rules [BER] are used for serialization:

   (1)  When encoding the length field, only the definite form is used;
        use of the indefinite form encoding is prohibited.  Note that
        when using the definite-long form, it is permissible to use more
        than the minimum number of length octets necessary to encode the
        length field.

   (2)  When encoding the value field, the primitive form shall be used
        for all simple types, i.e., INTEGER, OCTET STRING, and OBJECT



SNMPv3 Working Group     Expires September 2000                [Page 12]

Internet Draft         Transport Mappings for SNMP          3 April 2000


        IDENTIFIER (either IMPLICIT or explicit).  The constructed form
        of encoding shall be used only for structured types, i.e., a
        SEQUENCE or an IMPLICIT SEQUENCE.

   (3)  When encoding an object whose syntax is described using the BITS
        construct, the value is encoded as an OCTET STRING, in which all
        the named bits in (the definition of) the bitstring, commencing
        with the first bit and proceeding to the last bit, are placed in
        bits 8 to 1 of the first octet, followed by bits 8 to 1 of each
        subsequent octet in turn, followed by as many bits as are needed
        of the final subsequent octet, commencing with bit 8.  Remaining
        bits, if any, of the final octet are set to zero on generation
        and ignored on receipt.

   These restrictions apply to all aspects of ASN.1 encoding, including
   the message wrappers, protocol data units, and the data objects they
   contain.

8.1.  Usage Example

   As an example of applying the Basic Encoding Rules, suppose one
   wanted to encode an instance of the GetBulkRequest-PDU [RFC-PROTO]:

     [5] IMPLICIT SEQUENCE {
             request-id      1414684022,
             non-repeaters   1,
             max-repetitions 2,
             variable-bindings {
                 { name sysUpTime,
                   value { unspecified NULL } },
                 { name ipNetToMediaPhysAddress,
                   value { unspecified NULL } },
                 { name ipNetToMediaType,
                   value { unspecified NULL } }
             }
         }

Internet Draft         Transport Mappings for SNMP          3 April 2000



   Applying the BER, this would be encoded (in hexadecimal) as:

   [5] IMPLICIT SEQUENCE          a5 82 00 39
       INTEGER                    02 04 52 54 5d 76
       INTEGER                    02 01 01
       INTEGER                    02 01 02
       SEQUENCE (OF)              30 2b
           SEQUENCE               30 0b
               OBJECT IDENTIFIER  06 07 2b 06 01 02 01 01 03
               NULL               05 00
           SEQUENCE               30 0d
               OBJECT IDENTIFIER  06 09 2b 06 01 02 01 04 16 01 02
               NULL               05 00
           SEQUENCE               30 0d
               OBJECT IDENTIFIER  06 09 2b 06 01 02 01 04 16 01 04
               NULL               05 00

   Note that the initial SEQUENCE is not encoded using the minimum
   number of length octets.  (The first octet of the length, 82,
   indicates that the length of the content is encoded in the next two
   octets.)

11.  Security Considerations

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change) the objects accessible through a command
   responder application.

   It is recommended that the implementors consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the
   View-based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to a MIB is properly configured to give access
   to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change) them.
