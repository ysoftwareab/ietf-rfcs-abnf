Internet-Draft          The Diameter Document Set              July 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document is intended to provide a stable reference to the
   dynamic set of RFCs describing the Diameter protocol.  As such, it is
   expected that it will be updated/obsoleted shortly after any new
   Diameter-related RFC is published.


2.  Terminology

   AAA
      Authentication, Authorization and Accounting


3.  The Diameter Document Set

   The Diameter document set has two components:

   o  products of the IETF itself, generally Standards-Track [RFC2026]
      RFCs

   and

   o  RFCs relating to Diameter-based protocols developed outside the
      IETF.

3.1.  IETF Documents

   Currently, the IETF Diameter specification consists of the Base
   protocol specification [RFC3588], Transport Profile [RFC3539] and
   several applications: Mobile IPv4 [RFC4004], Network Access Server
   (NASREQ) [RFC4005], Credit Control [RFC4006], Extensible
   Authentication Protocol (EAP) [RFC4072], Session Initiation Protocol
   (SIP) [RFC4740], and Mobile IPv6 [RFC5447].

   The following subsections briefly summarize the documents included in
   the present set.

3.1.1.  Diameter Base Protocol

   The Base Protocol document [RFC3588] defines the fundamental protocol
   specification for Diameter AAA, which includes support for
   accounting.

3.1.2.  AAA Transport Profile

   The Transport Profile document [RFC3539] discusses transport layer
   issues that arise with AAA protocols and contains recommendations on

Internet-Draft          The Diameter Document Set              July 2009


   how to overcome these issues.  This document also defines the
   Diameter failover algorithm and state machine.

3.1.3.  Applications

3.1.3.1.  Mobile IPv4

   The Mobile IPv4 [RFC4004] document defines a Diameter application
   that allows a Diameter server to perform AAA functions for MobileIPv4
   services to a mobile node.

3.1.3.2.  Network Access Server (NASREQ)

   This document [RFC4005] describes the Diameter protocol application
   used for AAA services in the Network Access Server (NAS) environment.
   When combined with the Diameter Base protocol [RFC3588], Transport
   Profile [RFC3539], and EAP [RFC4072] specifications, this application
   specification satisfies typical network access service requirements.

3.1.3.3.  Diameter Credit Control

   This document [RFC4006] specifies a Diameter application that can be
   used to implement real-time credit-control for a variety of end user
   services such as network access, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   [RFC3261] services, messaging services, and download services.

3.1.3.4.  EAP

   This document [RFC4072] defines the Diameter Command-Codes and AVPs
   necessary to carry EAP packets between a Network Access Server (NAS)
   and a back-end authentication server.

3.1.3.5.  SIP

   This application [RFC4740] is designed to be used in conjunction with
   SIP and provides a Diameter client co-located with a SIP server, with
   the ability to request the authentication of users and authorization
   of SIP resources usage from a Diameter server.

3.1.3.6.  Mobile IPv6

   This document [RFC5447] describes Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping using the
   Diameter Network Access Server to home AAA server interface.

3.2.  Other RFCs

Internet-Draft          The Diameter Document Set              July 2009


3.2.1.  3GPP EPS Command Codes

   This document [RFC5516] registers a set of Diameter Command Codes to
   be used in new vendor-specific Diameter applications defined for the
   Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Evolved Packet System
   (EPS), specifically those related to the Mobile Management Entity
   (MME) and Serving GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) Support Node
   (SGSN) interfaces in the architecture for the Evolved 3GPP Packet
   Switched Domain.

3.2.2.  ITU-T Rw Policy Enforcement Interface

   This document [RFC5431] describes the need for a new pair of IANA
   Diameter Command Codes to be used in a vendor-specific new
   application, namely for the ITU-T Rec. Q.3303.3 - Rw interface used
   to send a request/response for authorizing network Quality of Service
   (QoS) resources and policy enforcement in a network element, as one
   of the recommendations of the International Telecommunication Union -
   Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T).

3.2.3.  Diameter Policy Processing Application

   This document [RFC5224] describes the need for a Diameter Command
   Code to be used in a vendor-specific application for invocation of
   Policy Processing (Policy Evaluation, or Evaluation and Enforcement).
   This application is one of the implementations of the Open Mobile
   Alliance (OMA) Policy Evaluation, Enforcement and Management (PEEM)
   enabler.

3.2.4.  3GPP Release 5 Command Codes

   This document [RFC3589] describes the IANA allocation of a block of
   Diameter Command Codes for the Third Generation Partnership Project
   (3GPP) Release 5.


4.  Security Considerations

   This document has no relevance for security.


5.  IANA considerations

   This document makes no requests of IANA.
