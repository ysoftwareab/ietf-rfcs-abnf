          Encapsulation for PSC for Multi-Segment Pseudowires
               draft-shawam-pwe3-ms-pw-protection-00.txt

Abstract

   In RFC 6378 'MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Linear Protection', as
   well as in the later updates of this RFC, the Protection State
   Coordiantion (PSC) protocol was defined for MPLS LSPs only.  This
   draft extends RFC 6378 to be applicable for pseudowires as well.

1.  Introduction

   In RFC 6378 'MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Linear Protection'
   [RFC6378], as well as in the later updates of this RFC in 'MPLS
   Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Linear Protection to Match the
   Operational Expectations of SDH, OTN and Ethernet Transport Network
   Operators' [RFC7271] and in 'Updates to MPLS Transport Profile Linear
   Protection' [I-D.ietf-mpls-psc-updates], the Protection State
   Coordination (PSC) protocol was defined for MPLS LSPs only.

   This draft extends RFC 6378 to be applicable for pseudowires (PWs) as
   well.  This is useful especially in the case of end-to-end static
   provisioned Multi-Segment PWs (MS-PWs) running over MPLS-TP where we
   can't rely on tunnel protection alone for end-to- end protection of
   PWs against switching PE (S-PE) failure.

2.  Encapsulation of the PSC protocol for Pseudowires

   The PSC protocol can be used to protect against defects on any LSP
   (segment, link or path).  Linear protection protects an LSP end-to-
   end and if a failure is detected, switches traffic over to another
   (redundant) set of resources.

   Obviously, the protected entity does not need to be of the same type
   as the protecting, it is possible to protect a link by a path.
   Likewise it is possible to protect a PW with a MS-PW.

   From a PSC protocol point of view it is possible to view a PW as a
   single hop LSP, and a MS-PW as a multiple hop LSP.  The PSC protocol
   will work just as specified in RFC 6378.

   Thus the G-ACh carrying the PSC protocol information is placed in the
   label stack directly beneath the PW identifier.

3.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations defined for RFC 6378 apply to this
   document as well.  As this is simply a re-use of RFC 6378, there are
   no new security considerations.

4.  IANA Considerations

   There are no requests for IANA actions in this document.

   Note to the RFC Editor - this section can be removed before
   publication.
