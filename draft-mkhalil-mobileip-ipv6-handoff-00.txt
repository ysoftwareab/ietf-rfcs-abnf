Abstract

   This draft outlines a protocol to achieve minimal disruption during
   Mobile IPv6 handoff. Minimal disruption during handoff is required by
   Mobile IPv6 to reduce the window of data loss experienced by a MN
   (Mobile Node) when moving between access networks that may belong to
   same or different administrative domains.

1.0  Introduction

   This draft outlines a protocol to achieve minimal disruption during
   Mobile IPv6 handoff. Minimal disruption during handoff is required by
   Mobile IPv6 to reduce the window of data loss experienced by a MN
   when moving between access networks that may belong to same or
   different administrative domains.

   In this draft we consider two types of handoff. First, the reactive
   handoff where the MN does not have a knowledge of the sub- network it
   is moving to until it receives a router advertisement.  Second, the
   proactive handoff where the MN has the knowledge about the sub-
   network it is moving to before its L2 (layer two) connectivity is
   established. Since a AAA (Authentication, Authorization and
   Accounting) protocol will be used in the future to provide
   authentication, authorization and accounting functions, our proposed
   solution takes into account of the existence of AAA.

   In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST, "MUST NOT", "optional",
   "recommended", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT", are to be interpreted as
   described in [13].


1.3  Terminology

   This document frequently uses the following terms:

   MM (Mobility Manager)

   An MM (Mobility Manager) is an entity in the mobility service
   provider domain which communicates with the AAA in the current
   adomain,llocate a mobility router (HA) to route the traffic destined
   to the MN while it is away from home. It may also have an access to
   the authentication and key generation centers to authenticate the
   user as well as generate session keys. The MM will act as a temporary
   agent to forward the data traffic to the MN until the registration
   process is completed with with the HMM (MM at the home domain).

     HMM (Home Mobility Manager)

     It is the MM at home domain.

     SMM (Serving Mobility Manager)

     It serves the function of the MM within a foreign domain.

2.0 Objective


   The proposed solution for handoff is designed with the following
   objectives.

   1 - The control and data plane are two separate entities. The
       session setup and management are performed in the control plane,
       whereas the data transfer between a CN (Correspondent Node)
       and a MN is done in the data plane.

   2 - The data transfer (for data plane only) between a CN and
       a MN should not go through any additional functional blocks that
       are not defined in the Mobile IPv6 support [1].

       Adding these type of nodes to the network present the following
       disadvantages:

       a - prove to be a bottle neck in the system.
       b - complicate the architecture thorough an increase in component
           count.
       c - potential single point of failure, unless made robust through
           high availability.
       d - may force traffic to flow along non-optimal routes to allow
           control action by such nodes.

   3 - The proposed solution should require only minimal extensions to
       the IPv6 protocol [1] and should fully exploit and track the
       evolving routing and addressing capabilites offered by IPv6.

   4 - The proposed solution should be generic enough and independent
       of the type of wireless technology or access medium.

   5 - The proposed solution should fuly support, and be consistent
       with a AAA architecture.

   6 - The proposed solution should optimize air-interface usage for
       efficiency. The current IPv6 protocol requires n+4 number of
       messages to be sent in case of a handoff:
       n being the number of Binding Update messages sent to n CNs,
       2 round trip messages sent to the DHCPv6 server, 1 round trip
       message sent to the HA (Home Agent), and another round trip
       message to the HA on the previous foreign sub-network to
       establish forwarding from the previous COA (Care-Of Address).

INTERNET DRAFT                                              October 1999


   7 - The proposed solution should offer protection against IPv6
       address hogging by malicious MNs.

3.0 Definition of Handoff delay

   Handoff delay time defines the granularity with which the mobility
   infrastructure can maintain network reachability to a MN as it moves
   across access regions. Handoff delay should be, to the furthest
   possible extent, independent of the traffic flowing to and from the
   MN. In other words, the handoff delay should be definable for an idle
   MN since it is ideally a network attribute, and not a host attribute.

   The proposed definition of "Handoff delay" is as follows:  It is the
   time in milliseconds required from the transmission of an Agent
   Advertisement to the transmission of a Registration Reply from the
   network to the N. The architecture should ensure that all
   Mintermediate routability information has been updated in the interim
   period.

4.0 Proposed System Architecture
   The following is the high level view of the proposed system


                         -----                      ------

                       Figure 1: Functional Components

4.1 Control Plane

   As mentioned earlier, the proposed solution makes a distinction
   between the Control Plane and the Data Plane. The Control Plane deals
   with all the interactions required for a MN to connect to its
   subnetwork point of attachment (such as AAA interactions, router
   advertisements, establishing binding and routing information etc.).

   The Control Plane signals are divided into two types.

INTERNET DRAFT                                              October 1999


   a - Resource Management Plane allocates and manages all the network
       resources needed for serving the MN (such as the AAA
       functions, transfer of user status and context information, IP
       address management, distribution of session keys etc.).

   b - Routing Plane sets up the basic data path between a
       CN and a MN. It manages the binding
       between the MN and the network. The Mobile IPv6 messages
       described in [1] are used in this plane.

4.2 Data Plane

   The Data Plane provides the basic IP layer routing of data packets
   between a CN and a MN as described in [1].

5.0  Intradomain Initial Registration

   This section shows the registration flow for a scenario where the MN
   powers up in a foreign sub-network, within a foreign domain.

      |<-----------------------------|  BA   |
      |         |         |          |       |

                 Figure 2: Intradomain Initial Registration

   1 - MN constructs a local IP address (ensuring uniqueness) and
       sends a Registration Request to the MM located at the foreign
       sub-network, requesting allocation of a globally routable
       long-term IP address for the MN on the current foreign
       sub-network. The MN also provides some form of coincidental
       information which helps to verify the identity of the MN.
       The MM successfully validates the identity of the MN prior to
       issuing a request to the DHCPv6 server to allocate an IP
       address to the MN, acting as a relay agent. The MM replies
       to the request of the MN with the allocated IPv6 address.

       This address is used as the COA of the MN.


   2 - The MN sends a BU (Binding Update) [1] to the HMM. The HMM may
       allocate a serving HA for the MN and subsequently send a BU to
       register the MN with this HA.

   3 - The allocated HA registers the MN and responds with a BA message
       to the HMM, which in turn triggers a BA message back to the MN.

  As stated in [1], the BU messages are secured through IPSec tunnels
  established between the MN and the HMM, and between the HMM and
  various HAs.

6.0  Reactive Intradomain Handoff

   This section shows the registration flow where the MN performs an
   handoff from one subnetwork to another within the home domain.

       sub-network, requesting allocation of a globally routable
       long-term IP address for the MN on the current foreign
       sub-network. The MN provides some form of coincidental
       information which helps to verify the identity of the MN.
       The MM successfully validates the identity of the MN prior to
       issueing a request to the DHCPv6 server to allocate an IP
       address to the MN, acting as a relay agent. The MM replies to
       the request of the MN with the allocated IPv6 address. This
       address is used as the COA of the MN.

   2 - The new SMM (nSMM) issues a System Handoff Request to the old
       SMM (oSMM). Upon receiving the System Handoff request, the oSMM
       requests a HA to perform packet forwarding from the previous
       COA to the new COA [1]. To do so, the oFMM sends a BU to the
       allocated HA along the link on which the previous COA is
       located [1]. The oSMM sends a System Handoff Reply back to the
       requesting nSMM providing a user context, composed of
       information such as session keys or the type of services
       granted for the user.

   3 - Upon being assigned a new COA, the MN sends a BU to the HMM
       which includes a list of IP addresses of all CNs
       the MN has been communicating with at that instant. Upon
       receiving the BU, the HMM first allocates a HA to serve
       the MN, and then forwards the BU to the newly designated HA.
       The new HA processes the BU as stated in [1]. The HMM then
       updates all the CNs entered in the CN list with the MN's
       new COA.

7.0 Proactive Intradomain Handoff

   This section shows the registration flow where the MN has the
   knowledge that it is moving to an new sub-network but it does not
   have any L2 connectivity with that new sub-network. The new and the
   old sub-networks that the MN is roaming about belongs to same
   administrative domains.

   The following steps are performed.

                  Figure 4: Proactive Intradomain Handoff

   1 - When the MN detects that it is moving to another new sub-
       network that belongs to the same domain of the current
       sub-network, it sends a System Handoff Request to the
       current SMM (oSMM).

   2 - The oSMM sends a Handoff And Context Transfer Request to the
       new SMM (nSMM).

   3 - The nSMM allocates a new COA to the MN and returns back a Handoff
       And Context Transfer Response to the oSMM.

   4 - The oSMM allocates an HA for the MN to bicast the data destined
       to the MN to both old and new COA. The oSMM sends a System
       Handoff Response to the MN confirming the completion of the
       handoff process.

   5 - When the MN receives the System Handoff Response from the oSMM
       and establishes a L2 connectivity with the new sub-network it
       sends a BU to the HA to update the current binding with the new
       COA [1]. If the MN didnot receive a System Handoff Response from
       the oSMM due to a L2 disconnection with the new foreign
       sub-network, it then goes through the Reactive Intradomain
       Handoff process as mentioned in the previous section.

         co-located COA for the MN using DHCPv6. The SMM also
         constructs a AAA Registration Request and sends it to
         the FAAA.

     3 - The FAAA forwards the request to the HAAA based on the
         realm portion of the user's NAI.

     4 - When the HAAA receives the AAA Registration Request, it
         attempts to authenticate the MN. If the MN's authentication
         and authorization are affirmative, the request is forwarded
         to the HMM for further processing.

     5 - If requested, the HMM allocates a home IP address to the MN.
         If the home network is provisioned with multiple HAs for load
         distribution, the HMM may also allocate a HA to serve the MN.
         The HMM then constructs a Registration Response and
         subsequently forwards it back to the MN via the HAAA and
         FAAA.

     6 - Once the MN receives a successful registration Reply from the
         network, it proceeds with the regular MIPv6 registration as
         stated in [1].

  The detailed structure of Registration Request, AAA Registration
  Request, Regitration Response and AAA Registration Response messages

   1 - MN sends a Registration Request to the SMM located at the
       foreign subnetwork.

   2 - The SMM at the current subnetork sends System Handoff Request
       to the old SMM to allocate an HA within the old foreign

       the previous COA address to the new COA. The lifetime of
       this binding shall equal the execution time for the events
       3-7 to occur.

   3 - The SMM verifies the received message, and allocates a
       co-located COA for the MN using the DHCPv6 service. The SMM
       also constructs a AAA Registration Request and subsequently
       sends the request to the FAAA.

   4 - The FAAA forwards the request to the HAAA based on the realm

       attempts to authenticate the MN. If MN passes the
       authentication and the autherization successfully, the
       request is forwarded to the HMM.
