Internet-Draft              Atompub Features                 August 2007


1.  Introduction

   This document introduces extensions for the Atom Publishing Protocol
   service document [I-D.ietf-atompub-protocol] format for expressing
   metadata about the behaviors, functions and capabilities supported by
   an Atom Publishing Protocol collection.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].

   This specification uses XML Namespaces [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114]
   to uniquely identify XML element names.  It uses the following
   namespace prefix for the indicated namespace URI;

     "f": "http://purl.org/atompub/features/1.0"

   This specification uses terms from the XML Infoset
   [W3C.REC-xml-infoset-20040204].  However, this specification uses a
   shorthand; the phrase "Information Item" is omitted when naming
   Element Information Items.  Therefore, when this specification uses
   the terms "element" and "attribute" it is referring, respectively, to
   the Element and Attribute Information Items in Infoset terms.

   This specification uses the terms "atomUri" and
   "atomCommonAttributes" from the non-normative RELAX NG Compact schema
   included in [RFC4287].  Where used, these serve the same purpose and
   have the same meaning as their use in [RFC4287].

   Atom allows the use of IRIs [RFC3987].  Every URI [RFC3986] is also
   an IRI, so a URI may be used wherever below an IRI is named.  There
   are two special considerations: (1) when an IRI that is not also a
   URI is given for dereferencing, it MUST be mapped to a URI using the
   steps in Section 3.1 of [RFC3987] and (2) when an IRI is serving as
   an identifier, it MUST NOT be so mapped.

   Any element defined by this specification MAY have an xml:base
   attribute [W3C.REC-xmlbase-20010627].  When xml:base is used, it
   serves the function described in section 5.1.1 of [RFC3986],
   establishing the base URI (or IRI) for resolving any relative
   references found within the effective scope of the xml:base
   attribute.

   Any element defined by this specification MAY have an xml:lang
   attribute, whose content indicates the natural language for the

   element and its descendents.  The language context is only
   significant for elements and attributes declared to be "Language-
   Sensitive".  Requirements regarding the content and interpretation of
   xml:lang are specified in XML 1.0 [W3C.REC-xml-20040204], Section
   2.12.


3.  The f:feature element

   A feature is an abstract behavior, function and capability supported
   by an Atom Publishing Protocol collection.  Examples of features that
   might be supported by an Atom publishing server include support for
   draft entries, scheduled publication of entries, use of a particular
   set of Atom format extensions, use of a particular authentication
   scheme, and so on.  The f:feature element can be used in an app:
   collection element to declare that a collection supports the feature
   specified and may require that a client use that feature when
   interacting with the endpoint.  Features are identified using
   permanent, universally unique IRI's.

     namespace f = "http://purl.org/atompub/features/1.0"

     feature = element f:feature {
       atomCommonAttributes,
       attribute ref    { atomUri },
       attribute status { 'supported' | 'preferred' |
                          'required' | 'unsupported'}?,
       attribute href   { atomUri }?,
       attribute label  { text }?,
       (anyElement)*
     }

     anyElement = element * - f:feature {
       (attribute * { text }
         | text
         | anyElement)*
     }

   The ref attribute specifies a globally unique IRI identifying a
   feature supported by a collection.  The value of the ref attribute
   MUST be compared on a case-sensitive, character-by-character basis.
   Relative references MUST NOT be used.

   The status attribute indicates a collection's level of support for
   the identified feature.  The value of the attribute can be
   "supported", "preferred", "required" or "unsupported".  If not
   specified, the value is assumed to be "supported".  If any value
   other than those listed in this specification is specified, the



Snell                     Expires March 3, 2008                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft              Atompub Features                 August 2007


   attibute MUST be interpreted as being "supported".

   Support attribute values are case-insenstive.

   o  The value "supported" indicates that the server supports the
      identified feature.  Clients MAY utilize the feature when
      interacting with the collection.  If the client does not support
      or recognize a "supported" feature, the client can safely ignore
      it.
   o  The value "preferred" indicates that the server prefers the use of
      the identified feature.  Clients SHOULD utilize the feature when
      interacting with the collection.
   o  The value "required" indicates that server supports the identified
      feature and requires that clients utilize it when interacting with
      a collection.  A client that does not support or understand a
      required feature SHOULD NOT attempt to interact with the
      collection.
   o  The value "unsupported" indicates that the server explicitly does
      not support a feature.  Clients SHOULD NOT utilize the feature
      when interacting with the collection.

   Some features supported by a collection might not require that the
   client take any specific action when interacting with the server.
   For such features, the "required" and "preferred" support levels
   SHOULD be considered to be synonymous with "supported".

   An optional href attribute MAY be used to specify the URI of a human-
   readable description of the feature.  Relative references MAY be
   used.

   The optional label attribute MAY be used to specify a human-readable
   label for the feature.  The value of the label attribute is Language-
   Sensitive as defined by Section 2 of [RFC4287].

   The f:feature element MAY contain any number of child elements and
   attributes from any XML namespace, with the exception of the
   f:feature element itself.  Such markup is considered to be metadata
   applicable to the feature identified by the f:feature element.
   Software agents MUST NOT stop processing or signal an error or change
   their behavior as a result of encountering such markup.

   An app:collection element MAY contain zero or more f:feature elements
   but MUST NOT contain more than one with the same ref attribute value.
   The order in which f:feature elements appear within the app:
   collection element is insignificant.

   The f:feature element MAY contain attributes included as part of the
   atomCommonAttributes production defined by Section 2 of [RFC4287] or



Snell                     Expires March 3, 2008                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft              Atompub Features                 August 2007


   any update thereof.  When used on an f:feature element, such
   attributes serve the same purpose described in [RFC4287] or their
   corresponding specifications.

   It is important to point out that implementors who add "required"
   features to existing collections can cause existing client
   applications to fail and can limit the ability of client applications
   to evolve independently of a specific server implementation.  A
   better strategy would be to indicate that new features are
   "preferred".  Doing so can allow existing clients to continue to
   function while communicating the servers preference that new clients
   utilize the new feature.

   Server implementors also need to remember that, as an extension to
   the Service Document syntax, not all Atom Publishing Protocol client
   applications will recognize and support the use of the f:feature
   element.  Such clients will be incapable of determining which
   features are supported, preferred, or required.

3.1.  Example

   The following is an example of a collection supporting one
   hypothetical required feature, one unsupported feature, and a number
   of supported features.

     <service
       xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2007/app"
       xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
       xmlns:f="http://purl.org/atompub/features/1.0">
       <workspace>
         <atom:title>My Workspace</atom:title>
         <collection href="...">
           <atom:title>My Atom Collection</atom:title>
           <accept>application/atom+xml;type=entry</accept>
           <f:feature
             ref="http://www.w3.org/2007/app/drafts" />
           <f:feature
             ref="http://www.w3.org/2007/app/xhtml-content"
             support="preferred" />
           <f:feature
             ref="http://www.w3.org/2007/app/html-content" />
           <f:feature
             ref="http://www.w3.org/2007/app/preserve-extensions" />
           <f:feature
             ref="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0" />
           <f:feature
             ref="http://www.w3.org/2007/app/binary-content"
             status="unsupported" />
           <f:feature
             ref="http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/GoogleLogin"
             href="http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/"
             label="Google Login" status="required" />
         </collection>
       </workspace>
     </service>

3.2.  Contradictory Features

   Some combinations of features can be contradictory when the support
   level of one or more of those features is "required" and the others
   are "supported" or "preferred".  For instance, a collection that
   specifies that XHTML values in the atom:title is required and that
   HTML in an atom:title is supported is contradictory.  Such
   contradictions can cause problems for clients that are attempting to
   select an appropriate collection based on the support level of
   various features.  A service document MUST NOT specify contradictory
   features.  If a client determines that the features specified in a



Snell                     Expires March 3, 2008                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft              Atompub Features                 August 2007


   service document are contradictory, the client SHOULD proceed as if
   the support level for each of those features is "supported".

   When multiple, potentially contradictory features are specified such
   that the support level for one is marked as "preferred" and the
   others are "supported", clients SHOULD use the "preferred" feature.
   If more than one potentially contradictory feature is marked as
   "preferred", the client SHOULD proceed as if the support level for
   each of those features is "supported".


4.  The f:type element

   The content of an f:type element is a media-range as defined in
   [RFC2616].

     type =
       element f:type {
         atomCommonAttributes,
         ( text? )
       }

   Media type parameters are allowed within f:type, but f:type has no
   notion of preference - "accept-params" or "q" arguments, as specified
   in Section 14.1 of [RFC2616] are not significant.

   White space (as defined in [W3C.REC-xml-20040204]) around the f:type
   element's media-range is insignificant and MUST be ignored.

   Any number of f:type elements MAY appear as children of an f:feature
   element.  When used with features whose ref attributes identify the
   "XML Content", "Binary Content" or "Reference Content" features as
   defined in Section 6.1.1, the f:type elements specify the set of
   media types that can be specified in the atom:content elements type
   attribute and thereby the type of content that be included within or
   referenced by the atom:content.  If no f:type elements are specified
   for these features, clients SHOULD treat this as equivalent to an
   f:type element with the content "*/*".

   The order of f:type elements within a f:feature element is
   insignificant.

4.1.  An example f:feature using the f:type element


     <f:feature
       ref="http://www.w3.org/2007/app/binary-content">
       <f:type>image/jpg</f:type>
       <f:type>image/png</f:type>
       <f:type>image/gif</f:type>
       <f:type>text/*</f:type>
     </f:feature>



5.  Digitally Signing Service Documents

   Because the mechanisms defined in this specification can be used to
   compel client applications to implement certain behaviors when
   interacting with a collection, implementors who specify required
   features are encouraged to sign Service Documents containing the
   features extension using an Enveloped Signature, as described by XML-
   Signature and Syntax Processing [W3C.REC-xmldsig-core-20020212].

   Processors of Service Documents MUST NOT reject signed documents
   because they are not capable of verifying it; they MUST continue
   processing and MAY inform the user of their failure to validate the
   signature.  In other words, the presence of an element with the
   namespace URI "http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#" and a local name
   of "Signature" as a child of the document element MUST NOT cause a
   Processor to fail merely because of its presence.

   Section 6.5.1 of [W3C.REC-xmldsig-core-20020212] requires support for
   Canonical XML [W3C.REC-xml-c14n-20010315].  However, many
   implementers do not use it because signed XML documents enclosed in
   other XML documents have their signatures broken.  Thus, Processors
   that verify signed Service Documents MUST be able to canonicalize
   with the exclusive XML canonicalization method identified by the URI
   "http://www.w3.org/2001/10/xml-exc-c14n#", as specified in Exclusive
   XML Canonicalization [W3C.REC-xml-exc-c14n-20020718].

   Section 4.4.2 of [W3C.REC-xmldsig-core-20020212] requires support for
   DSA signatures and recommends support for RSA signatures.  However,
   because of the much greater popularity in the market of RSA versus
   DSA, Processors that verify signed Atom Service Documents MUST be
   able to verify RSA signatures, but do not need be able to verify DSA
   signatures.  Due to security issues that can arise if the keying
   material for message authentication code (MAC) authentication is not
   handled properly, Service Documents SHOULD NOT use MACs for
   signatures.

6.  The "http://purl.org/atompub/features/1.0" Namespace

   The "http://purl.org/atompub/features/1.0" XML namespace is reserved
   for future forward-compatible revisions of this specification.
   Future updates to this document can add new elements and attributes
   to the namespace.  Software written to conform to this version of the
   specification will not be able to process such markup correctly and,
   in fact, will not be able to distinguish it from markup error.

   Processors that encounter such markup MUST NOT stop processing or
   signal an error.  It might be the case that the Processor is able to
   handle such markup correctly, and does so.  Otherwise, processors MAY
   bypass the markup and MUST NOT change their behavior as a result of
   the markups presence.


7.  Security Considerations

   Specific features supported by a collection may introduce security
   considerations and concerns beyond those discussed by the Atom
   Publishing Protocol and Atom Syndication Format specifications.
   Implementors must refer to the specifications and description of each
   feature to determine the security considerations relevant to each.

   Service documents can be signed using [W3C.REC-xmldsig-core-20020212]
   and are subject to the security considerations implied by its use.

   Digital signatures provide authentication, message integrity, and
   non-repudiation with proof of origin.


8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  Registry of Atom Publishing Features

   The Registry of Atom Publishing Features is maintained by IANA and
   contains information about known features that can be supported by
   Atom Publishing Protocol implementations.  New assignments are
   subject to IESG approval, as outlined in [RFC2434].  Requests should
   be made by email to IANA, which will then forward the request to the
   IESG, requesting approval.  The request should use the following
   template:

   o  Ref: (A globally unique IRI identifying the feature)
   o  Label: (A human-readable label for the feature)
   o  Support Levels: (A description of the relevant support levels for
      the feature)

   o  Contradictory Features: (A listing of features that are
      contradictory to this feature when one or more are marked as

         server will ignore the element if present.
   o  Contradictory Features: none
