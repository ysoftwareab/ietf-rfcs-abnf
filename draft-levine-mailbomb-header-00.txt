          A Message Header to Identify Subscription Form Mail
                    draft-levine-mailbomb-header-00

Abstract

   Many organizations have web forms that provoke an e-mail confirmation
   to the e-mail address provided in the form.  Malicious entities do
   bulk form submissions with forged addresses, resulting in mail floods
   to the holders of those addresses.  This document defines a message
   header to identify mail sent in response to web forms, so that
   recipient mail systems can better recognize and mitigate the mail
   floods.

1.  Introduction

   Discussion Venue:    For the time being, discussion about this draft
      is directed to the collaboration@mailman.m3aawg.org [1] mailing
      list.

   Many organizations have web forms that provoke an e-mail confirmation
   to the e-mail address provided in the form.  Malicious entities sbmit
   multiple forms with forged addresses, resulting in mail floods to
   those addresses.  We define a message header that identifies mail
   sent in response to web forms, so that recipient mail systems can
   better recognize and mitigate the mail floods.

   Mail systems that recognize a mail flood may defer or reject the
   mail.  We also define an SMTP enhanced status code that a mail system
   can use in a message rejection SMTP reponse to alert the sending
   system that the message was rejected due to being part of a mail
   flood.

2.  Conventions

   The terms Message Submission Agent (MSA) and Message Transfer Agent
   (MTA) are defined as in [RFC5598].

   The ABNF [RFC5234] terms CRLF, FWS, and fields are imported from
   [RFC5322].

3.  The Form-Sub header field

   A MSA or an initial MTA adds a Form-Sub header field to indicate that
   the message was sent in response to a web form submission.  The
   header consists of a semicolon-separated list of tag=value pairs.
   The first tag-value pair is "v=1" to indicate that the header uses
   the initial version of this specification.  Subsequent tag-value
   pairs are optional, and receivers should ignore pairs with unknown
   tags.

   The tags ip4 or ip6 contain the IPv4 or IPv6 address, respectively,
   from which the web form was submitted.  The address may be partially
   redacted for privacy reasons, by replacing groups of digits with the
   letter "x", for example, 198.51.x.x or 2001:DB8::x or
   x::1234:abcd:5678:ef01.  If the sender cannot determine the
   submitting IP address, it can include "ip=none".  The goal of
   including the IP address is to help receiving mail systems recognize
   when a cluster of messages was provoked by the same submitter.

       ABNF:

       fields =/ "Form-Sub:" FWS "v=1" *(FWS ";" FWS fsarg) CRLF

       fsarg = "ip4=" ip4redacted
       ip4redacted = IPv4 address with parts optionally replaced by "x"

       fsarg =/ "ip6=" ip6redacted
       ip6redacted = IPv6 address with parts optionally replaced by "x"

       fsarg =/ "ip=none"

   The Form-Sub header should be included within the set of the headers
   signed by any DKIM [RFC6376] signature headers.

4.  Mail flood enhanced status code

   A mail receiver may choose to defer or reject mail that it recognizes
   as part of a mail flood.  It can include the enhanced status code
   X.7.TBD to indicate that the rejection is due to the message being
   part of a mail flood that includes Form-Sub headers.

5.  Security Considerations

   IP addresses are sometimes considered to be personally identifable
   information.  This specification allows partially redacted addresses
   as a compromise to avoid identifying individual persons, while still
   providing receivers a hint to recognize bulk submissions by the same
   party.

   The Form-Sub header discloses information from a sender to a
   receiver, and the X.7.TBD enhanced status code discloses information
   from a receiver to a sender that they would not otherwise have.  If
   one party suspects the other is malicious, e.g., a receiver fears
   that a sender is probing to see what its mail volume limits are, it
   might not include the header or the status code for the possibly
   malicious other party.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update registries as follows.

6.1.  Provisional Message Header Registry

   The following value is added to the Provisional Message Header
   Registry

   +------------------+----------+----------+--------+-----------------+
   |   Header Field   | Template | Protocol | Status | Reference       |
   |       name       |          |          |        |                 |

6.2.  Enhanced Status Codes

   The following value is added to the Enhanced Status Codes Enumerated
   Status Codes Registry
