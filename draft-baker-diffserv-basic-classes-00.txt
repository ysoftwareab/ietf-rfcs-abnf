1. Introduction  
    
   This paper summarizes a recommended correlation of applications to 
   Differentiated Service Code Points (DSCP), Per-Hop Behaviors (PHB) 
   and traffic conditioners. There is no intrinsic requirement that 
   particular DSCPs be used for certain applications, but as a policy 
   it is useful that DSCP marking, traffic conditioning and PHBs be 
   applied consistently across the network. 
    

1.1 Expected use in the Network 

    
   In the Internet today, corporate LANs and ISP WANs are generally not 
   heavily utilized - they are commonly 10% utilized at most. For this 
   reason, congestion, loss, and variation in delay within corporate 
   LANs and ISP backbones is virtually unknown. This clashes with user 
   perceptions, for three very good reasons. 
     
     - The industry moves through cycles of bandwidth boom and 
       bandwidth bust, depending on prevailing market conditions and 
       the periodic deployment of new bandwidth-hungry applications. 
      
     - In access networks, the state is often different. This may be 
       because throughput rates are artificially limited, or because of 
       access network design trade-offs. 
      
     - Other characteristics, such as database design on web servers 
       (which may create contention points, e.g. in filestore), and 
       configuration of firewalls and routers, often look externally 
       like a bandwidth limitation. 
       
   The intent of this document is to provide a consistent marking, 
   conditioning and packet treatment strategy so that it can be 
   configured and put into service on any link which finds itself 
   congested. 
    

1.2 Key Differentiated Services Concepts 
    
   The reader must be familiar with the principles of the 
   Differentiated Services Architecture [8]. However, we recapitulate 
   key concepts here so save searching. 
     

1.2.1 Queuing  
    
   A queue is a data structure that holds traffic that is awaiting 
   transmission. The traffic may be delayed while in the queue, 
   possibly due to lack of bandwidth, or because it is low in priority. 
   There are a number of ways to implement a queue; in some of these, 
   it is more natural to discuss "service classes in a queuing system" 
  
Babiarz et al.          Expires December 2003                 [Page 3] 
Internet Draft          DiffServ-Basic-Classes               June 2003 
 
   rather than "a set of queues and a scheduler". In the literature, as 
   a result, the concepts are used somewhat interchangeably.  
    
   A simple model of a queuing system, however, is a set of data 
   structures for packet data, which we will call queues or service 
   classes and a mechanism for selecting the next packet from among 
   them, which we call a scheduler. 
     

1.2.1.1 Priority Queuing 
    
   A priority queuing system is a combination of a set of queues and a 
   scheduler that empties them in priority sequence. When asked for a 
   packet, the scheduler inspects the highest priority queue, and if 
   there is data present returns a packet from that queue. Failing 
   that, it inspects the next highest priority queue, and so on. A 
   freeway onramp with a stoplight for one lane, but which allows 
   vehicles in the high occupancy vehicle lane to pass, is an example 
   of a priority queuing system; the high occupancy vehicle lane 
   represents the "queue" having priority.  
    
   In a priority queuing system, a packet in the highest priority queue 
   will experience a readily calculated delay - it is proportional to 
   the amount of data remaining to be serialized when the packet 
   arrived plus the volume of the data already queued ahead of it in 
   the same queue. The technical reason for using a priority queue 
   relates exactly to this fact: it limits delay and variations in 
   delay, and should be used for traffic which has that requirement.  
    
   A priority queue or queuing system needs to support rate and burst 
   size control mechanism(s) to provide starvation avoidance of lower 
   priority queues. 
       

1.2.1.2 Rate Queuing 

    
   Similarly, a rate-based queuing system is a combination of a set of 
   queues and a scheduler that empties each at a specified rate. An 
   example of a rate based queuing system is a road intersection with a 
   stoplight - the stoplight acts as a scheduler, giving each lane a 
   certain opportunity to pass traffic through the intersection.  
    
   In a rate-based queuing system, such as WFQ[27][26] or WRR[28], the 
   delay that a packet in any given queue will experience is dependant 
   on the parameters and occupancy of its queue and the parameters and 
   occupancy of the queues it is competing with. A queue whose traffic 
   arrival rate is much less than the rate at which it lets traffic 
   depart will tend to be empty and packets in it will experience 
   nominal delays. A queue whose traffic arrival rate approximates or 
   exceeds its departure rate will tend to be not empty, and packets in 
   it will experience greater delay. Such a scheduler can impose a 
   minimum rate, a maximum rate, or both, on any queue it touches.

1.2.2 Active Queue Management 
    
   "Active queue management" or AQM is a generic name for any of a 
   variety of procedures that use packet dropping or marking to manage 
   the depth of a queue. The canonical example of such a procedure is 
   Random Early Detection [25], in which a queue is assigned a minimum 
   and maximum threshold, and the queuing algorithm maintains a moving 
   average of the queue depth. While the mean queue depth exceeds the 
   maximum threshold, all arriving traffic is dropped. While the mean 
   queue depth exceeds the minimum threshold but not the maximum 
   threshold, a randomly selected subset of arriving traffic is marked 
   or dropped. This marking or dropping of traffic is intended to 
   communicate with the sending system, causing its congestion 
   avoidance algorithms to kick in. As a result of this behavior, it is 
   reasonable to expect that TCP's cyclic behavior is desynchronized, 
   and the mean queue depth (and therefore delay) should normally 
   approximate the minimum threshold.  
    
   A variation of the algorithm is applied in Assured Forwarding [11], 
   in which the behavior aggregate consists of traffic with multiple 
   DSCP marks, which are intermingled in a common queue. Different 
   minima and maxima are configured for the several DSCPs separately, 
   such that traffic which exceeds a stated rate at ingress is more 
   likely to be dropped or marked than traffic which was within its 
   contracted rate.  
    

1.2.3 Traffic Conditioning  

    
   Additionally, at the first router in a network that a packet 
   crosses, arriving traffic may be measured, and dropped or marked 
   according to a policy, or perhaps shaped on network ingress as in A 
   Rate Adaptive Shaper for Differentiated Services [23]. This may be 
   used to bias feedback loops, such as is done in Assured Forwarding 
   [11], or to limit the amount of traffic in a system, as is done in 
   Expedited Forwarding [19]. Such measurement procedures are 
   collectively referred to as "traffic conditioners".  Two traffic 
   conditioners that are use in deployment of differentiated services 
   that use Assured Forwarding are the Two Rate Three Color Marker 
   (trTCM) [18] and the Single Rate Three Color Marker (srTCM) [17].  
    
   Two Rate Three Color Marker: 
     The Two Rate Three Color Marker (trTCM) meters an IP packet stream 
     and marks its packets based on two rates, Peak Information Rate 
     (PIR) and Committed Information Rate (CIR), and their associated 
     burst sizes to be green, yellow, or red.  A packet is marked red if 
     it exceeds the PIR.  Otherwise it is marked either yellow or green 
     depending on whether it exceeds or doesn't exceed the CIR. The 
     trTCM is use to enforce committed rate separately from Peak 
     Information Rate.

Internet Draft          DiffServ-Basic-Classes               June 2003 
 
    
   Single Rate Three Color Marker: 
     The Single Rate Three Color Marker (srTCM) meters an IP packet 
     stream and marks its packets green, yellow, or red.  Marking is 
     based on a Committed Information Rate (CIR) and two associated 
     burst sizes, a Committed Burst Size (CBS) and an Excess Burst Size 
     (EBS).  A packet is marked green if it doesn't exceed the CBS, 
     yellow if it does exceed the CBS, but not the EBS and red 
     otherwise.  The srTCM is used to enforce the committed rate and 
     burst length. 
      

1.2.4 Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) 
    
   The DSCP is a number in the range 0..63, which is placed into an IP 
   packet to mark it according to the class of traffic it belongs in. 
   Half of these values are earmarked for standardized services, and 
   half of them are available for local definition.  
    

1.2.5 Per-Hop Behavior (PHB) 

    
   In the end, the mechanisms described above are combined to form a 
   specified set of characteristics for handling different kinds of 
   traffic, depending on the needs of the application. This document 
   seeks to identify useful traffic aggregates and specify what PHB 
   should be applied to them. 
     

1.3 Key Service Concepts 
    
   While Differentiated Services is a general architecture that may be 
   used to implement a variety of services, three fundamental services 
   have been defined and characterized for general use. These are basic 
   service for elastic traffic, the Assured Forwarding service, and the 
   Expedited Forwarding service for real-time (inelastic) traffic.  
    
   The terms "elastic" and "real-time" are defined in RFC 1633[2] 
   section 3.1, as a way of understanding broad brush application 
   requirements. This document should be reviewed to obtain a broad 
   understanding of the issues in quality of service, just as RFC 
   2475[8] should be reviewed to understand the data plane architecture 
   used in today's Internet.  
    
   The definition of "service class" is, a description of the overall 
   treatment of (or a subset of) a customer's traffic across a 
   particular domain, across a set of interconnected DiffServ Domain 
   (DS) domains, or end-to-end. Service descriptions are covered by 
   administrative policy and services are constructed by applying 
   traffic conditioning to create behavior aggregates which experience 
   a known PHB at each node within the DS domain. A service class 
   provides the specified end-to-end behaviors in the network which 
  
Babiarz et al.          Expires December 2003                 [Page 6] 
Internet Draft          DiffServ-Basic-Classes               June 2003 
 
   will support one or more applications or a set of applications that 
   have similar traffic characteristics and performance requirements. 
   This concept allows grouping of applications of similar traffic 
   characteristics and performance requirements into a common 
   forwarding discipline called a "service class" that provides 
   consistent behavior in the administered network. (Service class 
   definitions originates from RFC 2474 [7] section 2 definition of a 
   service) 
     

1.3.1 Default Forwarding (DF) 
    
   The basic services applied to any class of traffic are those 
   described in RFC 2474[7] and RFC 2309[6]. Best Effort Service may be 
   summarized as "I will accept your packets", with no further 
   guarantees. Packets in transit may be lost, reordered, duplicated, 
   or delayed at random. Generally, networks are engineered to limit 
   this behavior, but changing traffic loads can push any network into 
   such a state. 
     
   Application traffic in the internet is expected to be "elastic" in 
   nature. By this, we mean that the receiver will detect loss or 
   variation in delay in the network and provide feedback such that the 
   sender adjusts its transmission rate to approximate available 
   capacity. 
     
   For basic best effort service, a single DSCP value is provided to 
   identify the traffic, a queue to store it, and active queue 
   management to protect the network from it and to limit delays. The 
   interesting thing is that by giving that queue a higher minimum rate 
   than its measured arrival rate, we can effectively limit the 
   deleterious effects of congestion on a given class of traffic, 
   transferring them to another class that is perhaps better able to 
   absorb the impact or is considered to be of lower value to the 
   network administration. So, for example, if it is important to 
   service database exchange or transaction traffic in a timely 
   fashion, isolating the traffic into a queue and giving it a 
   relatively high minimum rate will accomplish that.  
    
   Scavenger, or less than best effort, service can also be provided, 
   for applications with congestion avoidance capabilities and is 
   considered to be of lower value to the network administration then 
   best effort traffic. 
    

1.3.2 Assured Forwarding (AF) 

    
   The Assured Forwarding RFC 2597[11] service is explicitly modeled on 
   Frame Relay's DE flag or ATM's CLP capability, and is intended for 
   networks which offer average-rate SLAs (as FR and ATM networks do). 
   This is an enhanced Best Effort service; traffic is expected to be 
   "elastic" in nature. The receiver will detect loss or variation in 
  
Babiarz et al.          Expires December 2003                 [Page 7] 
Internet Draft          DiffServ-Basic-Classes               June 2003 
 
   delay in the network and provide feedback such that the sender 
   adjusts its transmission rate to approximate available capacity.  
    
   For such classes, multiple DSCP values are provided (two or three, 
   perhaps more using local values) to identify the traffic, a common 
   queue or class to store the aggregate and active queue management to 
   protect the network from it and to limit delays. Traffic is metered 
   as it enters the network, and traffic is variously marked depending 
   on the arrival rate of the aggregate. The premise is that it is 
   normal for users to occasionally use more capacity than their 
   contract stipulates, perhaps up to some bound. However, if traffic 
   must be lost or marked to manage the queue, this excess traffic will 
   be marked or lost first. 
     

1.3.3 Expedited Forwarding (EF) 
    
   Expedited Forwarding RFC 3246[19] was originally proposed as a way 
   to implement a virtual wire, and can be used in such a manner. It is 
   an enhanced best effort service: traffic remains subject to loss due 
   to line errors and reordering during routing changes. However, using 
   queuing techniques, the probability of delay or variation in delay 
   is minimized. For this reason, it is generally used to carry voice 
   and for transport of data information that requires "wire like" 
   behavior through the IP network. Voice is an inelastic "real-time" 
   application that send packets at the rate the codec produces them, 
   regardless of availability of capacity. As such, this service has 
   the potential to disrupt or congest a network if not controlled. It 
   also has the potential for abuse.  
    
   To protect the network, at minimum one must police traffic at 
   various points to ensure that the design of a queue is not over-run, 
   and then the traffic must be given a low delay queue (often using 
   priority, although it is asserted that a rate-based queue can do 
   this) to ensure that variation in delay is not an issue, to meet 
   application needs. 
     

1.3.4 Class Selector (CS) 

    
   Class Selector provides support for historical codepoint definitions 
   and PHB requirement. The Class Selector DS field provides a limited 
   backward compatibility with legacy (pre Diffserv) practice, as 
   described in RFC 2474 [7] section 4.  Backward compatibility is 
   addressed in two ways.  First, there are per-hop behaviors that are 
   already in widespread use (e.g. those satisfying the IPv4 Precedence 
   queuing requirements specified in [RFC 1812]), and we wish to permit 
   their continued use in DS-compliant networks. In addition, there are 
   some codepoints that correspond to historical use of the IP 
   Precedence field and we reserve these codepoints to map to PHBs that 
   meet the general requirements specified in RFC 2474 Sec. 4.2.2.2. 
    
  
Babiarz et al.          Expires December 2003                 [Page 8] 
Internet Draft          DiffServ-Basic-Classes               June 2003 
 
   No attempt is made to maintain backward compatibility with the "DTR" 
   or TOS bits of the IPv4 TOS octet, as defined in [RFC 791]. 
    
   A DS-compliant network can be deployed with a set of one or more 
   Class Selector Compliant PHB groups.  As well, network administrator 
   may configure the network nodes to map codepoints to PHBs 
   irrespective of bits 3-5 of the DSCP field to yield a network that 
   is compatible with historical IP Precedence use. Thus, for example, 
   codepoint '011000' would map to the same PHB as codepoint '011010'. 
    

1.3.5 Admission Control 
    
   Admission control including refusal when policy thresholds are 
   crossed, can assure high quality communication by ensuring the 
   availability of bandwidth to carry a load. Inelastic real-time flows 
   like VoIP (telephony) or video conferencing services can benefit 
   from use of admission control mechanism, as generally the telephony 
   service is configured with over subscription, meaning that some 
   user(s) may not be able to make a call during peak periods. 
      
   For VoIP (telephony) service, a common approach is to use call 
   admission control that is performed by a telephony call 
   server/gatekeeper using signaling (SIP, H.323, H.248, MEGACO, etc.) 
   on access points to the network. The bandwidth for telephony service 
   on access points needs to be configured for the number of 
   simultaneous VoIP sessions supported. Another approach that may be 
   used in small and bandwidth constrained networks for limited number 
   of flows is RSVP[4][13]. However, there is concern with the 
   Scalability [5] of this solution in large networks and Aggregation 
   [15] of sessions is considered to be a requirement. 
    

1.3.6 Service Differentiation 

    
   There are practical limits on the level of service differentiation 
   that should be offered in the IP networks. We believe we have 
   defined a practical approach in delivering service differentiation 
   by defining different service classes that networks need to support 
   to provide the appropriated level of behaviors and performance 
   needed to support current and future applications and services. The 
   defined structure for providing services allows several applications 
   having similar traffic characteristics and performance requirements 
   to be grouped into one service class and therefore forwarded by 
   single queue in a router. Also we provide a method for different 
   application (flows) within a service class to have unique DSCP 
   marking so that different conditioning and policing polices may be 
   used for different flows, through the use of Class Selector (CS) 
   codepoints or locally defined DSCP (EXP/LU) values and associating 
   them with the standardized PHBs. This approach provides a lot of 
   flexibility in providing the appropriate level of service 
   differentiation for current and new yet unknown applications without

   introducing significant changes to routers or network configurations 
   when new traffic type is added to the network.   
    
    

2. Traffic Categories and Service Classes 
    
   This document divides traffic into four categories, one network 
   control and three user/subscriber traffic categories. The term 
   "user" and "subscriber" are used interchangeable in this document. 
   Network control traffic can further be divided into two service 
   classes, mainly flows that are critical, require lower delay or 
   higher probability of being serviced and normal network control 
   flows.  User/subscriber traffic is broken down into three user 
   traffic categories, interactive, responsive and timely as defined by 
   ITU-T Recommendation G.1010.  These three user traffic categories 
   can further be subdivided into two different service classes within 
   each traffic category to provide further behavior differentiation. 
   End-to-end performance requirements for these traffic categories and 
   service classes are further defined in ITU-T Recommendation Y.1541, 
   Y.1540 and G.1010. Additionally, network operators may choose to 
   define other service classes, like less than best effort or 
   Scavenger. 
      
   The service classes define the required treatment for the traffic in 
   order to meet user, application or network expectations.  Section 3 
   defines the network control traffic category and section 4 defines 
   the user traffic categories with examples of intended application 
   types mapped into each of their service classes.  Note that the 
   application types are only examples and are not meant to be all-
   inclusive.  Also it should be noted that the service class naming or 
   ordering does not imply any priority ordering.  They are simply 
   reference names that are used in this document with associated QoS 
   behaviors that are optimized for the particular applications they 
   support. Network administrators may choose to assign different 
   service class names, to the services that they will support.  Table 
   1 below defines the relationship between traffic categories, service 
   classes and DS codepoint(s) assignment with application examples.

3.0 Network Control Traffic Category 
    
   Network control traffic is defined as packet flows that are 
   essential for stable operation of the administered network as well 
   for information that may be exchanged between neighboring networks 
   across a peering point where SLAs are in place. Network control 

  
Babiarz et al.          Expires December 2003                [Page 12] 
Internet Draft          DiffServ-Basic-Classes               June 2003 
 
   traffic is different from user application control (signaling) that 
   may be generated by some applications or services.  Network control 
   traffic is mostly between routers and network nodes that are used 
   for administering, controlling or managing the network segments and 
   the services that are provided in that network segment. A network 
   operator may choose to split the network control traffic into two 
   service classes i.e., critical network control and normal network 
   control and provide two different forwarding treatments or just 
   support one forwarding treatment for all network control flows. 
    

3.1 Critical Service Class 
    
   The Critical service class is intended to be used for control 
   traffic that is within a single administrative network domain. If 
   such traffic does not get through, the administrated network domain 
   may not function properly. Example of such type of traffic is 
   heartbeats between core network switches/routers. Such heartbeats 
   are used to determine if the next hop is reachable. If no heartbeat 
   is received within a specified time interval, then the sending 
   router assumes that the particular link or next hop node is 
   unreachable on a particular interface and subsequently reroutes the 
   traffic to a backup interface that can reach the next hop node.  
   This reroute is typically done in a time interval much shorter than 
   the time it would take for the routing protocol to determine that 
   the next hop node is unreachable. 
    
   The Critical service class uses the DiffServ Class Selector (CS) PHB 
   defined in RFC 2474 [7] and should be configured to receive sufficed 
   forwarding resources so that all packets are forwarded quickly.  The 
   Critical service class should be configured to use Priority Queuing 
   system such as defined in Section 1.2.1.1 of this document.  
    
   The following protocols and application should use the Critical 
   service class: 
     - Network administrator telnet sessions from secure and trusted 
       terminals 
     - Protocol(s) that are transmitted between nodes within the 
       administered network for detecting of link and nodal failures 
     - Used for critical control traffic within an administrative 
       domain 
     - May be used for any control traffic that is forwarded within the 
       administered network domain 
     - User traffic must not be mapped into this service class 
     - Inter-network domain (across peering points) control traffic 
       must not be mapped into this service class 
    
   Traffic characteristics of critical control packet flows: 
     - Mostly messages between routers and network servers 
     - Typically 50 to 200 byte packet sizes, one packet at a time 
     - No user-to-user traffic is allowed to use this service class

   Recommended DSCP marking is CS7 (Class Selector 7) 
    
   Network edge conditioning: 
     - Drop or remark CS7 marked packets at ingress to DiffServ network 
       domain.  
     - Depending on policy within the administered network, CS7 marked 
       packets may be dropped or remarked to CS6 at egress of DiffServ 
       network or across peering points. 
    

3.2 Network Service Class 
    
   The Network service class is used for transmitting packets between 
   network devices (routers, servers, etc.) that require control 
   information to be exchanged between different administrative domains 
   (across a peering point) and for non-critical network control 
   information exchange within one administrative domain. Traffic 
   transmitted in this service class is very important as it keeps the 
   network operational and needs to be forwarded in a timely manner. 
    
   The Network service class uses the DiffServ Class Selector (CS) PHB 
   defined in RFC 2474 [7]. This service class is configured so that 
   the traffic receives a minimum bandwidth guarantee, to ensure that 
   the packets always receive timely service. The configured forwarding 
   resources for Network service class should be such that the 
   probability of packet drop under peak load is very low in this 
   service class. The Network service class should be configured to use 
   Rate Queuing system such as defined in Section 1.2.1.2 of this 
   document. 
    
   The following protocols and applications should use the Network 
   service class: 
     - Routing packet flows, OSPF, BGP, ISIS, RIP, ICMP 
     - Policy management flows between nodes in the network, COPS, 
       RSVP, RSVP-TE, etc. 
     - SIP signaling between high capacity telephony call servers or 
       soft switches.  Such high capacity devices may control thousands 
       of telephony (VoIP) calls.   
     - Network services, DNS, DHCP, BootP, high priority OAM (SNMP) 
       like alarms, etc. 
     - Used for control information exchange within and between 
       different administrative domains across a peering point where 
       SLAs are in place. 
     - In 3GPP wireless solutions, used to transport UMTS Signaling 
       information between wireless nodes 
     - User traffic must not be mapped into this service class 
    
   Traffic characteristics of network control packet flows: 
     - Mostly messages between routers and network servers 
     - Ranging from 50 to 1,500 byte packet sizes, normally one packet 
       at a time but traffic can also burst (BGP) 
     - No user-to-user traffic is allowed to use this service class

Internet Draft          DiffServ-Basic-Classes               June 2003 
 
    
   Recommended DSCP marking is CS6 (Class Selector 6) 
    
   Network edge conditioning: 
     - At peering points (between two DiffServ networks) where SLAs are 
       in place, CS6 marked packets are policed using a single rate 
       with burst size (sr+bs) token bucket policer to keep the CS6 
       marked packet flows to within the traffic rate specified in the 
       SLA. 
     - CS6 marked packet flows from untrusted sources (end user 
       devices) are dropped or remarked at ingress to DiffServ network. 
       Packets from users are not permitted access to the Network or 
       Critical service classes 
    
   If Critical service class is not supported, then the Network service 
   class is used for both normal network control traffic and critical 
   control traffic defined in this document and packets marked with CS7 
   DSCP receive the same forwarding treatment as CS6 marked packets.  
    

4 User Traffic Categories 
    
   User traffic is divided into three different categories, namely, 
   interactive, responsive and timely. An example of interactive 
   traffic is between two humans and is most sensitive to delay, loss 
   and jitter.  Another example of interactive traffic is between two 
   servers where very low delay and loss is needed. Responsive traffic 
   is typically between a human and a server but also can be between 
   two servers.  Responsive traffic is less affected by jitter and can 
   tolerate longer delays than interactive traffic.  Timely traffic is 
   either between servers or servers and humans and the delay tolerance 
   is significantly longer than responsive traffic. The three traffic 
   categories follow methodology defined by ITU-T Recommendation Y.1541 
   and G.1010. 
    
   To put this into perspective: 
     - Interactive traffic requires a delay performance through the IP 
       network on the order of 10s of milliseconds 
     - Responsive traffic requires a delay performance through the IP 
       network on the order of 100s of milliseconds 
     - Timely traffic requires a delay performance through the IP 
       network of less than 1 second.  
    
   Network operators can categorize their applications based on the 
   type of behavior that they require.  Table 1 provides some common 
   applications and the forwarding service class that best supports 
   them based on their performance requirements.   
    
   In summary:  
     - Premium service class is best suited for IP telephony (VoIP) and 
       circuit emulation over IP applications.

Internet Draft          DiffServ-Basic-Classes               June 2003 
 
     - Multimedia service class is best suited for applications that 
       require very low delay but are of variable rate in nature, such 
       as video conferencing and interactive gaming.  
     - Streaming service class is best suited for streaming media 
       applications.   
     - Human-Responsive service class is best suited for interactive 
       client / server applications.   
     - Transaction service class is best suited for store and forward 
       applications such as FTP.   
     - Standard service class is for traffic that has not bean 
       identified as requiring differentiated treatment and is normally 
       referred as being best effort.  
     - Scavenger service class is intended for traffic or networks 
       where bandwidth assurance is not required.  
    
   Note, a network operator may choose to support all or subsets of the 
   defined service classes and provide service differentiation only to 
   the applications/service that are mapped into them.  
    

4.1 Interactive Traffic Category 
    
   Interactive traffic category can be further split into two service 
   classes, Premium and Multimedia to provide differentiation based on 
   the different behavior of source traffic being forwarded.  
    

4.1.1 Premium Service Class  

    
   Used for applications that require real-time, low delay, very low 
   packet loss for relatively constant-rate traffic sources (inelastic 
   traffic sources). This forwarding class is used predominantly for IP 
   telephony services and provides the low latency, jitter and loss 
   required. 
    
   The fundamental service offered to traffic in Premium service class 
   is best effort service up to a specified upper bound with low delay 
   and very low packet loss. Operation is in some respect similar to an 
   ATM CBR service, which has guaranteed bandwidth and if it stays 
   within the negotiated rate it experiences nominal delay and no loss. 
   The EF PHB has a similar guarantee. 
     
   Typical configurations negotiate the setup of telephone calls over 
   IP using protocols such as H.248, MEGACO, H.323 or SIP.  When a user 
   has been authorized to send telephony traffic, the call admission 
   procedure has verified that the newly admitted data rates will be 
   within the capacity of the Premium service class forwarding 
   capability in the network that it will use. For VoIP (telephony) 
   service, the common approach is to use call admission control 
   performed by a telephony call server/gatekeeper using signaling 
   (SIP, H.323, H.248, MEGACO, etc.) on access points to the network. 
   The bandwidth in the core network and the number of simultaneous

Internet Draft          DiffServ-Basic-Classes               June 2003 
 
   VoIP sessions that can be supported needs to be engineered and 
   controlled so that there is no congestion for this service. Since 
   RTP telephony flows do not respond to loss or substantial delay in 
   any substantive way, the Premium service class should forward packet 
   as soon as possible.  
     
   The Premium service class uses Expedited Forwarding (EF) PHB as 
   defined in RFC 3246 [19] and must be configured to receive 
   guaranteed forwarding resources so that all packets are forwarded 
   quickly. The Premium service class should be configured to use 
   Priority Queuing system such as defined in Section 1.2.1.1 of this 
   document. 
     
   Target applications for Premium service class: 
     - VoIP (G.711, G.729 and other codecs) 
     - Telephony signaling between end device (terminals/gateways) and 
       the call server (H.248, MEGACO, H.323, SIP) 
     - Lawful Intercept 
     - T.38 fax over IP 
     - Voice-band data over IP (modem, fax) 
     - Circuit emulation over IP, virtual wire, etc. 
     - In wireless 3GPP applications, used to forward traffic that is 
       mapped into the UMTS Conversational Traffic Class 
    
   Traffic characteristics:  
     - Mostly fixed size packets for VoIP (60 or 70 or 120 or 200 bytes 
       in size) 
     - Packet emitted at constant time intervals 
     - Admission control of new flows is provided by telephony call 
       server, media gateway, gatekeeper or access node that provides 
       "middlebox" function. 
    
   Recommended DSCP marking EF for the following applications:  
     - VoIP (G.711, G.729 and other codecs) 
     - Lawful Intercept 
     - Voice-band data over IP (modem) 
     - Circuit emulation over IP, virtual wire, etc. 
     - Conversational UMTS Traffic Class 
    
   Recommended DSCP marking CS5 for the following applications: 
     - Telephony signaling between end device (terminals/gateways) and 
       the call server (H.248, MEGACO, H.323, SIP) 
     - T.38 fax over IP 
    
   Both EF and CS5 DS codepoints are mapped into the Premium service 
   classes and used the Expedited Forwarding (EF) PHB. The CS5 DS 
   codepoint is aliased to the EF codepoint and packets marked with CS5 
   are forwarded using the EF PHB.  
    
   Network Edge Conditioning: 
     - Packet flows from untrusted sources (end user devices) must be 
       policed at ingress to DiffServ network using single rate with 

  
Babiarz et al.          Expires December 2003                [Page 17] 
Internet Draft          DiffServ-Basic-Classes               June 2003 
 
       burst size token bucket policer to ensure that the telephony 
       traffic stays within its negotiated bounds.  
     - Packet flows from trusted sources (media gateways inside 
       administered network) do not require policing. 
     - Policing of Premium packet flows across peering points where SLA 
       is in place is also not required as telephony traffic will be 
       controlled by admission control mechanism between peering 
       points.   
    
   Note: On low speed links (typically access links below 1Mbps), in 
   the attempt to minimize jitter/delay, it is recommended that 
   packetized audio streams are separated from processed telephony data 
   information flows like T.38 fax and telephony signaling and 
   forwarded using less stringent from delay/jitter perspective service 
   class. PCM voice when compressed produces very small packets i.e. 60 
   bytes in size were T.38 fax and signaling packets are much bigger. 
   The serialization delay, therefore delay/jitter for the larger T.38 
   fax and signaling packets can be significantly bigger over low speed 
   links then for 60 byte voice packets. For this reason it is 
   recommended that packetized voice packets receive a higher priority 
   forwarding treatment then the less sensitive from delay/jitter 
   perspective T.38 fax and telephony signaling packets. PCM audio 
   streams (voice) have a strict end-to-end delay constrain and should 
   use Priority Queuing system where as T.38 fax or telephony signaling 
   have a more liberal jitter/delay constrain and should use Rate 
   Queuing system on access links below 1 Mbps.  
    
   On higher speed links the difference in serialization delay is very 
   small, therefore both types of telephony packet flows are aggregated 
   in to a single forwarding service class to simplify network 
   engineering and use Priority Queuing system. As well, the forwarding 
   of voice packets and signaling packets with the same very low delay 
   forwarding service class minimizes delay as well as the difference 
   in delay between signaling and bearer path, therefore virtually 
   eliminating speech clipping and ring-clipping problems at start of 
   call when interfacing to PSTN.  
    

4.1.2 Multimedia Service Class 
    
   Used for applications that requires real-time and low delay for 
   variable rate elastic traffic source. The traffic sources 
   (applications) in this traffic class have the capability to change 
   their emitting rate based on feedback received from the receiving 
   end. Detection of packet loss by the receiver is sent using the 
   applications control stream to the transmitter as an indication of 
   possible congestion. The transmitter based on pre-configured 
   encoding rates (or transmitting rates) selects a lower rate for 
   transmission.  
    
   Typical video conferencing configurations negotiate the setup of 
   multimedia session using protocols such as H.323 or SIP.  When a

   user/end-point has been authorized to start a multimedia session the 
   admission procedure has verified that the newly admitted data rates 
   will be within the engineered capacity of the Multimedia service 
   class. The bandwidth in the core network and the number of 
   simultaneous video conferencing sessions that can be supported needs 
   to be engineered to control traffic load for this service.  
    
   The Multimedia service class uses the Assured Forwarding (AF) PHB 
   defined in RFC 2597 [11]. This service class is configured to 
   provide a bandwidth assurance for AF41, AF42, AF43 and CS4 marked 
   packets to ensure that they get forwarded. The Multimedia service 
   class should be configured to use Rate Queuing system such as 
   defined in Section 1.2.1.2 of this document. 
    
   Target application for Multimedia service class: 
     - Video conferencing (interactive video) 
     - Interactive gaming 
     - Server to server data transfer requiring very low delay 
     - IP VPN service that specifies two rates and mean network delay 
       that is slightly longer then network propagation delay. 
       Interactive, time critical and mission critical application 
       maybe encapsulated into this VPN service. 
     - In wireless 3GPP applications, used to forward traffic that is 
       mapped into the UMTS Interactive Traffic Class with Traffic 
       Handling Priority 1 (THP=1)  
    
   Traffic characteristics:  
     - Variable size packets (50 to 1500 bytes in size) 
     - Higher the rate, higher density of large packets 
     - Variable packet emission time  
     - Source capable of reducing its transmission rate based on 
       detection of packet loss at the receiver 
    
   Both the AF4x and CS4 DS codepoints are mapped into the Multimedia 
   service class and used the Assured Forwarding (AF) PHB. The CS4 DS 
   codepoint is aliased to the AF41 DS codepoint and packets marked 
   with CS4 are forwarded using the AF41 PHB.   
    
   Packet Marking: 
     - Interactive gaming packets are marked with CS4 
     - Video conferencing packets are marked with AF4x 
     - VPN service may be marked with AF4x or CS4 depending on the 
       service characteristics 
     - Server to server data transfer with AF4x or CS4 depending on the 
       service characteristics 
     - UMTS Interactive THP=1 packets are marked with AF4x 
    
   Packet flows from video conferencing equipment may be marked by the 
   video conferencing equipment or by the edge router using Two Rate 
   Three Color Marked (trTCM) as specified in RFC 2698 [18]. 
    
   Example of DSCP marking when performed by video conferencing 
   equipment:

Internet Draft          DiffServ-Basic-Classes               June 2003 
 
     - AF41 = H.323 video conferencing audio stream RTP/UDP 
     - AF41 = H.323 video conferencing video control RTCP/TCP 
     - AF41 = H.323 video conferencing video stream below specified 
       rate "A" 
     - AF42 = H.323 video conferencing video stream between specified 
       rate "A" and "B" 
     - AF43 = H.323 video conferencing video stream above specified 
       rate "B" 
     - Where rate "B" is greater in magnitude than rate "A" 
    
   Conditioning Performed at DiffServ Network Edge: 
     The Two Rate Three Color Marker (trTCM) should be used as specified 
     in RFC 2698 [18]. 
      
     If packets are marked by the sources or previous DiffServ domain, 
     then the trTCM should be configured to operate in Color-Aware mode. 
      
     If the packets are not marked by the source or previous DiffServ 
     domain, then the trTCM must be configured to operate in Color-Blind 
     mode. 
    
   Conditioning Requirements for CS4 marked Packets: 
     At DiffServ edge and boundary policing of CS4 marked packets must 
     be performed so both rate and burst size can be enforced. 
    
   The fundamental service offered to "Multimedia" traffic is best 
   effort service with controlled rate and delay. Some traffic in this 
   service class may not respond dynamically to packet loss. For video 
   conferencing service, typically a 1% packet loss detected at the 
   receiver triggers encoding rate change, drop to next lower 
   provisioned video encoding rate. As such, Active Queue Management 
   [6] is used primarily to switch video encoding rate under 
   congestion, change from high rate to lower rate i.e. 1472 kbps to 
   768 kbps. The probability of loss of AF41 and CS4 traffic may not 
   exceed the probability of loss of AF42 traffic, which in turn may 
   not exceed the probability of loss of AF43 traffic.  
     

4.2 Responsive Traffic Category 
    
   Responsive traffic category can be further split into two service 
   classes, Streaming and Human-Responsive to provide differentiation 
   based on the different behavior of source traffic being forwarded.  
    

4.2.1 Streaming Service Class  

    
   The Streaming service class is used for applications that require 
   near-real-time packet forwarding of variable rate traffic sources 
   which are not as delay sensitive as applications using the 
   Multimedia service class.  Such applications include broadcast TV, 
   streaming audio and video, video (movies) on demand and surveillance 
  
Babiarz et al.          Expires December 2003                [Page 20] 
Internet Draft          DiffServ-Basic-Classes               June 2003 
 
   video.  In general, the Streaming service class assumes that the 
   traffic is buffered at the source/destination and therefore, is less 
   sensitive to delay and jitter. 
     
   The Streaming service class uses the Assured Forwarding (AF) PHB 
   defined in RFC 2597 [11]. This service class is configured to 
   provide a minimum bandwidth assurance for AF31, AF32, AF33 and CS3 
   marked packets to ensure that they get forwarded. The Streaming 
   service class should be configured to use Rate Queuing system such 
   as defined in Section 1.2.1.2 of this document. 
    
   Target application for Streaming service class: 
     - Video surveillance and security (unicast) 
     - TV broadcast including HDTV (multicast) 
     - Pay per view movies and events (pre scheduled) 
     - Video on demand (unicast) with control (virtual DVD) 
     - Streaming audio (unicast) 
     - Streaming video (unicast) 
     - Web casts 
     - VPN service that supports different levels of flow assurance 
     - In wireless 3GPP applications, used to forward traffic that is 
       mapped into the UMTS Streaming Traffic Class  
    
   Traffic Characteristics: 
     - Variable size packets (50 to 4196 bytes in size) 
     - Higher the rate, higher density of large packets 
     - Variable packet emission rate  
     - Some bursting at start of flow from some applications 
     - At about 2% packet loss, video session is usually terminated 
    
   Both the AF3x and CS3 DS codepoints are mapped into the Streaming 
   service classes and used the Assured Forwarding (AF) PHB. The CS3 DS 
   codepoint is aliased to the AF31 DS codepoint and packets marked 
   with CS3 are forwarded using the AF31 PHB.  
     
   Applications or end systems pre-mark their packets with DSCP values 
   as shown in Table 3 below. If host is unable to pre-mark their 
   packets, then marking is performed on the DiffServ edge router using 
   MF classification. Due to the nature of the service, it is 
   recommended that video surveillance and security flows are market 
   with a different DSCP value so that traffic conditioning and 
   policing policies can be different from other flows in the Streaming 
   service class.

                 Table 3: Example of DSCP marking for Streaming 
    
   Network Edge Conditioning: 
     Packet flows from untrusted sources must be policed at the DiffServ 
     network edge using single rate policers with a burst size control 
     for AF31, AF32, AF33 and CS3 marked packets. Policing policy is 
     based on the SLA for supported application(s). For the above 
     defined applications, three single rate policers with burst size 
     control should be provided; one for CS3 marked packets, another for 
     AF31 marked packets and the third policer for AF32 and AF33 marked 
     packets. Packet flows from trusted sources i.e. TV broadcast 
     servers, etc. normally do not require policing. 
    
   The fundamental service offered to "Streaming" traffic is best 
   effort service with controlled rate and delay. This traffic does not 
   respond dynamically to packet loss. Packets marked with AF31 and CS3 
   DSCP requires very high assurance of delivery. Packets marked with 
   AF32 and AF33 can generally tolerated up to 1% and 2% packet loss 
   respectfully. As such, Active Queue Management [6] is used primarily 
   to reduce the number of flows at congestion points by dropping 
   packets from less important flows first before any AF31 and CS3 
   marked packets are dropped. The service should be provisioned so

   that CS3 and AF31 marked packet flows have high assurance for 
   bandwidth in the network. The probability of loss of AF31 and CS3 
   traffic may not exceed the probability of loss of AF32 traffic, 
   which in turn may not exceed the probability of loss of AF33.   
    

4.2.2 Human-Responsive Service Class  
    
   The Human-Responsive service class is used for elastic and 
   responsive typically client/server based applications.  Applications 
   forwarded by this service class are those requiring a relatively 
   fast response and typically have asymmetrical bandwidth need, i.e. 
   the client typically sends a short message to the server and the 
   server responds with a much larger data flow back to the client.  
   The most common example of this is when a user clicks a hyperlink 
   (~few dozen bytes) on a web page resulting in a new web page to be 
   loaded (Kbytes of data). This service class is configured to provide 
   good response for TCP [1] short lived flows that require real-time 
   packet forwarding of variable rate traffic sources. 
    
   The Human-Responsive service class uses the Assured Forwarding (AF) 
   PHB defined in RFC 2597 [11]. This service class is configured to 
   provide a minimum bandwidth assurance for AF21, AF22 and AF23 marked 
   packets to ensure that they get forwarded. The Human-Responsive 
   service class should be configured to use Rate Queuing system such 
   as defined in Section 1.2.1.2 of this document. 
    
   Target applications for Human-Responsive service class: 
     - Client / server applications 
     - SNA terminal to host transactions (SNA over IP using DLSw) 
     - Web based transactions (E-commerce) 
     - Credit card transactions 
     - Financial wire transfers 
     - ERP applications (.e.g. SAP / BaaN) 
     - VPN service that supports CIR (Committed Information Rate) with 
       up to two burst sizes  
     - In wireless 3GPP applications, used to forward traffic that is 
       mapped into the UMTS Interactive Traffic Class with Traffic 
       Handling Priority 2 (THP=2)   
    
   Traffic Characteristics: 
     - Variable size packets (50 to 1500 bytes in size) 
     - Variable packet emission rate  
     - With packet bursts of TCP window size 
     - Source capable of reducing its transmission rate based on 
       detection of packet loss at the receiver or through explicit 
       congestion notification. 
    
   The AF2x DS codepoints are mapped into the Human-Responsive service 
   classes and use the Assured Forwarding (AF) PHB.  
    
   DSCP marking:

Internet Draft          DiffServ-Basic-Classes               June 2003 
 
     - Inelastic packet flows are marked with AF21 
     - Elastic TCP flows are marked with AF2x  
     - VPN service may be marked with AF2x depending on the service 
       characteristics 
     - UMTS Interactive THP=2 packets are marked with AF2x 
    
   Marking of the DSCP may be performed by a host or by an edge router.  
    
   Conditioning Performed at the DiffServ Network Edge: 
     Conditioning may be performed on per-flow or on aggregated-flows 
     depending on the configuration and service offered. Metering and 
     (re)marking of flows is required at DiffServ edge node and on 
     DiffServ boundary node.  The Human-Responsive service class uses a 
     Single Rate Three Color Marker (srTCM) conditioner for AF2x flows. 
      
   Conditioning Requirements for AF2x marked packets: 
     Conditioning of aggregated packet flows destined for the Human-
     Responsive service class must be performed at the DiffServ edge of 
     the network. Furthermore, conditioning should be performed using 
     Single Rate Three Color Marker (srTCM) as defined in RFC 2697 [17].  
    
     If the packets are not pre-marked then the srTCM must be configured 
     to operate in the Color-Blind mode. 
      
     If the packets are pre-marked by the source or previous network 
     (boundary node) then the srTCM should be configured to operate in 
     the Color-Aware mode.  
    
   The fundamental service offered to "Human-Responsive" traffic is 
   best effort service with controlled rate and delay. The service 
   should be engineered so that AF21 marked packet flows have sufficed 
   bandwidth in the network to provide high assurance of delivery. 
   Since this traffic is elastic and responds dynamically to packet 
   loss, Active Queue Management [6] is used primarily to control TCP 
   flow rates at congestion points by dropping packet from TCP flows 
   where the burst length is high (AF23 and AF22 marked packets) first 
   before any AF21 packets are dropped. The probability of loss of AF21 
   traffic may not exceed the probability of loss of AF22 traffic, 
   which in turn may not exceed the probability of loss of AF23. Active 
   queue management may also be implemented using Explicit Congestion 
   Notification (ECN) [17] method as defined in RFC 3168. 
    

4.3 Timely Traffic Category 
     
   Timely traffic category can be further split into two service 
   classes, Transaction and Standard to provide differentiation based 
   on the different behavior of source traffic being forwarded.  
    

4.3.1 Transaction Service Class  

    
  
Babiarz et al.          Expires December 2003                [Page 24] 
Internet Draft          DiffServ-Basic-Classes               June 2003 
 
   The Transaction service class is configured to support elastic 
   applications that require timely packet forwarding of variable rate 
   traffic sources and more specifically is configured to provide good 
   throughput for TCP longer lived flows. TCP[1] or a transport with a 
   consistent Congestion Avoidance Procedure[9][10] normally will drive 
   as high a data rate as it can obtain over a long period of time. The 
   FTP protocol is a common example, although one cannot definitively 
   say that all FTP transfers are moving data in bulk.  
    
   The Transaction service class uses the Assured Forwarding (AF) PHB 
   defined in RFC 2597 [11]. This service class is configured to 
   provide a minimum bandwidth assurance for AF11, AF12, AF13 and CS2 
   marked packets to ensure that they are forwarded. The Transaction 
   service class should be configured to use Rate Queuing system such 
   as defined in Section 1.2.1.2 of this document. 
    
   Target applications for Transaction service class: 
     - Store and forward applications 
     - File transfer applications 
     - Email 
     - Non-critical OAM&P (Operation and Management and Provisioning) 
       using SNMP, XML, etc. 
     - VPN service that supports CIR (Committed Information Rate) with 
       up to two burst sizes  
     - In wireless 3GPP applications, used to forward traffic that is 
       mapped into the UMTS Interactive Traffic Class with Traffic 
       Handling Priority 3 (THP=3)   
    
   Traffic Characteristics: 
     - Variable size packets (50 to 1500 bytes in size) 
     - Variable packet emission rate  
     - With packet bursts of TCP window size 
     - Source capable of reducing its transmission rate based on 
       detection of packet loss at the receiver or through explicit 
       congestion notification. 
    
   Both the AF1x and CS2 DS codepoints are mapped into the Transaction 
   service classes and use the Assured Forwarding (AF) PHB. The CS2 DS 
   codepoint is aliased to the AF11 DS codepoint and packets marked 
   with CS1 are forwarded using the AF11 PHB.   
    
   DSCP marking: 
     - Non-critical OAM&P (SNMP, XML, etc.) packets are marked with CS2 
     - Elastic TCP flows are marked with AF1x  
     - VPN service may be marked with AF1x or CS2 depending on the 
       service characteristics 
     - UMTS Interactive THP=3 packets are marked with AF1x 
    
   Note: Since the performance requirements for non-critical OAM&P 
   traffic can be met with the Transaction service class and the amount 
   of non-critical OAM&P traffic is normally very small, we recommend 
   that non-critical OAM&P traffic be marked with CS2 DSCP and 
   forwarded using the Transaction service class. The marking of non-

Internet Draft          DiffServ-Basic-Classes               June 2003 
 
   critical OAM&P traffic with CS2 DS codepoint is recommended so that 
   different conditioning and policing policies can be used for non-
   critical OAM&P and other transaction traffic. 
    
   Marking of the DSCP may be performed by a host or by an edge router.  
    
   Conditioning Performed at the DiffServ Network Edge: 
     Conditioning may be performed on per-flow or for aggregated flows 
     depending on the configuration and the service offered. Metering 
     and (re)marking of DSCP is required at the DiffServ edge node and 
     on the DiffServ boundary node.  The Transaction service class uses 
     a Single Rate Three Color Marker (srTCM) conditioner for AF1x flows 
     and a single rate policer with a burst size limit for CS2 flows. 
    
   Conditioning Requirements for AF1x marked Packets: 
     Conditioning of aggregated packet flows destined for the 
     Transaction service class must be performed at the DiffServ edge of 
     the network. Furthermore, conditioning should be performed as 
     defined in RFC 2697 [17].  
      
     If the packets are not pre-marked, then the srTCM must be 
     configured to operate in the Color-Blind mode. 
      
     If the packets are pre-marked by the source or previous network 
     (boundary node) the srTCM should be configured to operate in the 
     Color-Aware mode. 
    
   Conditioning Requirements for CS2 marked Packets: 
     DiffServ edge and boundary nodes must police CS2 marked packets so 
     both rate and burst size can be enforced.  
    
   The fundamental service offered to "Transaction" traffic is best 
   effort service with a specified minimum rate. It can be assumed that 
   this class will consume any available bandwidth, and packets 
   traversing congested links may experience higher queuing delays 
   and/or packet loss.  
    
   Typical configurations use Explicit Congestion Notification [14] as 
   defined in RFC 3168 or random packet dropping to implement Active 
   Queue Management [6] and may impose a minimum or maximum rate. The 
   probability of loss of AF11 traffic may not exceed the probability 
   of loss of AF12 traffic, which in turn may not exceed the 
   probability of loss of AF13 traffic. Ingress traffic conditioning 
   passes traffic in the class up to some specified threshold marked as 
   AF11, additional traffic up to some secondary threshold marked as 
   AF12, and potentially passes additional traffic marked as AF13. In 
   such a case, if one network customer is driving significant excess 
   and another seeks to use the link, any losses will be experienced by 
   the high rate user, causing him to reduce his rate.  
    
   Packets marked with CS2 DSCP (OAM&P packets) should not be put 
   through Active Queue Management [6] function.

4.3.2 Standard Service Class 
    
   The Standard service class is used for all traffic that has not been 
   classified into one of the other supported forwarding service 
   classes in the DiffServ network domain. This service class provides 
   the Internet's "best effort" forwarding behavior. This service class 
   typically has no bandwidth, delay, loss or jitter assurances. 
   The Standard service class uses the Default Forwarding (DF) PHB 
   defined in RFC 2474 [7] and should be configured to receive a small 
   percentage of forwarding resources (at least 5%). This service class 
   should be configured to use Rate Queuing system such as defined in 
   Section 1.2.1.2 of this document. 
    
   Target application for the Standard service class: 
     - Any undifferentiated application/packet flow transported through 
       the DiffServ enabled network 
     - In wireless 3GPP applications, used to forward traffic that is 
       mapped into the UMTS Background Traffic Class  
    
   Traffic Characteristics: 
     - Non deterministic, mixture of everything 
    
   The DSCP marking is DF (Default Forwarding) 
    
   Network Edge Conditioning: 
     There is no requirement that conditioning of packet flows be 
     performed for this service class. 
    
   The fundamental service offered to the Standard service class is 
   best effort service with active queue management to limit over-all 
   delay. Typical configurations use Explicit Congestion Notification 
   [14] or random packet dropping to implement Active Queue Management 
   [6], and may impose a minimum or maximum rate on the queue. 
    

4.4 Scavenger Service Class 

    
   The Scavenger service class serves applications which run over TCP 
   [1] or a transport with a consistent congestion avoidance procedure 
   [9][10], and which the user is willing to accept service without 
   guarantees.  This service class is specified in [20]. 
    
   Target application for the Scavenger service class: 
     - Any TCP based application/packet flow transported through the 
     DiffServ enabled network that does not require any bandwidth 
     assurances. 
    
   Traffic Characteristics: 
     - Non real-time and elastic. 
    
   The DSCP marking is CS1 (Class Selector 1)

   Network Edge Conditioning: 
     There is no requirement that conditioning of packet flows be 
     performed for this service class. 
    
   The fundamental service offered to the scavenger service class is 
   best effort service with zero bandwidth assurance.  By placing it 
   into a separate queue or class, it may be treated in a manner 
   consistent with a specific service level agreement. 
    
   Typical configurations use Explicit Congestion Notification [14] or 
   random loss to implement active queue management [6].   
     

5. Security Considerations 
    
   This document discusses policy, and describes a common policy 
   configuration, for the use of a Differentiated Services Code Point 
   by transports and applications. If implemented as described, it 
   should require the network to do nothing that the network has not 
   already allowed. If that is the case, no new security issues should 
   arise from the use of such a policy.  
    
   It is possible for the policy to be applied incorrectly, or for a 
   wrong policy to be applied in the network for the defined service 
   class. In that case, a policy issue exists which the network must 
   detect, assess, and deal with. This is a known security issue in any 
   network dependent on policy directed behavior.  
    
   A well known flaw appears when bandwidth is reserved or enabled for 
   a service (for example, voice transport) and another service or an 
   attacking traffic stream uses it. This possibility is inherent in 
   DiffServ technology, which depends on appropriate packet markings. 
   When bandwidth reservation or a priority queuing system is used in a 
   vulnerable network, the use of authentication and flow admission is 
   recommended. To the author's knowledge, there is no known technical 
   way to respond to an unauthenticated data stream using service that 
   it is not intended to use, and such is the nature of the Internet.
