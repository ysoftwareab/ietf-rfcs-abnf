Abstract

    
    
    This paper provides the Mathematics for the New Paradigm Defining
    the Binary System. Furthermore, while the Mathematical foundation
    and Logical justification, which established the New Structure for
    the BINARY SYSTEM, were derived from The Mathematics of
    Quantification. The Mathematics itself, which is used in the New
    Binary System however, while providing the viable justification and
    the logical reasons that supports the change for the New Binary Model,
    is not quite so new. In fact, it can be said that the Mathematics of
    Quantification sustains a Cascading Effect, Producing a Profound Change
    in the Mathematics for the Entire Mathematical Field. But, the Mathematics
    for the New Binary System has a Historical Foundation, which dates to the
    beginnings of Mathematics itself.

Introduction: The Discourse, which Quells the Arguments in Opposition



    
    It is said: "Arrogance is the Defense using Words, A Pretense, which
    is the True Face of Ignorance, Hiding Behind the Mask of Intellectual
    Deception."
    
    Whatever the case may, or may not be, I truly attempted without any
    doubts, to contact the entire World, and present to everyone, the Gift
    from the Beginnings of the Mathematics of Quantification. However,
    only one person responded, this time, and their presentation was an
    opposition, one that bespeaks of Arrogance...not the anticipated
    response from a professional Mathematician or Logician:


    "Dear Mr. Terrell, 
 
     You are, as anybody else, free to prefer a nonstandard interpretation
     (or, rather, enumeration) of the binary system; there is no "true
     interpretation", and the ways to map integers to binary numbers is
     uncountable (as Cantor proved). 
 
     Nonetheless, the standard interpretation which you have chosen to attack
     is distinguished by one property which no other enumeration has: a
     simple arithmetic well-suited for the computers of our age. Addition,
     for example, can in the binary number system simply done as in the
     decimal system, except of course, that adding 1 to 1 yields 10, at any
     particular place. If you now take two numbers, say 9 and 5, translate
     them to their binary representations, and add them according to the rule
     mentioned:



 
 
                                00001001 <- 9 
                                00000101 <- 5 
                                ++++++++====== 
                                00001110 -> 14 
 



    and retranslate into the decimal system, you get 14. That means, addition
    in the binary system and in the decimal system are _isomorphic_, the same
    easy operation yields the same (correct) result in both number systems. 
 


E Terrell                                                      [Page 4]

Quantification, New Paradigm, Re-Defines Binary Math   February 22, 2002



    This is, in short, the reason why the standard interpretation of binary
    numbers is the one which computer scientists prefer, as it is easy to
    implement in electronic devices and hence forms the basis for modern-day
    computer chips. 


    Your interpretation of the binary numbers, to the contrary, does not have
    an arithmetic which is simple, as the zero digit can not function as
    neutral element anymore. It is therefore much clumsier to deal with. 
 
    Mathematicians do not accept claims at truth of any possible,
    non-selfcontradictory (= consistent) mathematical system. The times when
    mathematicians were thinking that their axiomatic systems, such as Euclid's
    axiomatics of geometry, were obvious truths and the only possible systems,
    they went away with the discovery of the consistency of non-Euclidean
    geometries in the early nineteenth century. Later on, logicians proved that
    mathematical truth is indeed equivalent to mathematical consistency. 
 
    To claim that there is a logical fault with the standard binary number
    system, you would have to derive a contradiction. This would have the
    interesting side effect of destroying the whole of current mathematics and
    rendering current computers unusable. I believe that you are right in your
    IETF draft which just expired, insofar as "no one has, or is capable" of
    deriving such a contradiction. That you make an exception for yourself, is,
    in my humble opinion, a sad indication of severe megalomania. I can only
    wish you to be healed of it and be able to spare your limited energies for
    endeavors not so futile as this one, though my experience with cases such
    as yours leaves me with little hope. 
 
    Sincerely yours, 
    Aleksandar Perovic 
 
    Chief Executive Administrator 
    The Electronic Library of Mathematics"

    My work, as a Scientist and a Researcher, speaks for itself, and my
    accomplishments ascribes the definition of me and my abilities, which
    defies the boundaries imposed by the definitions of the words used in
    the many languages denoting Mankind∆s diversity. It is sad though, because
    I am spending a great deal of time, clarifying Elementary Concepts, once
    thought to be Well Understood by the Professionals who populate the Field
    of Study for which this Draft represents. And while, I advocate the
    necessity regarding the priority for Studying the Historical Documents
    comprising the intended Area of Research, prior to any Research
    Undertaking. It should be understood however, my advocacy sustains a
    Revolution against Dogma, and supports the belief that; 'Regardless of
    the Epitome granted by the Historical Documentation, to any individual,
    belief or acceptance of their work remains a challenge, which is reserved
    for continued Analysis, and the reflection upon the Classical Foundation
    from which the Laws, Rules, and Logic that support their work, were
    derived.' Needless to say, since Mankind is Not GOD, I stand Poised in
    the Ready, and will challenge his perception or interpretation for Reality,
    regardless of the underlining subject matter, or the intent his
    presentation is said to represent.



    Notwithstanding my personal beliefs however, we can make use of the
    limited argument provided by 'Mr. Perovic', and derive not only the
    supporting Mathematics for the New Binary System, but provide the
    "...contradiction", which he claims is necessary to prove that the
    Modern Interpretation of the Method for Enumerating in the Binary
    System is wrong. Furthermore, what's nice about speaking with Mr. Perovic,
    is that, he reveals the Contradiction, unknowing to himself, that we
    need, as the focus for this argument, when he said: 



    "Nonetheless, the standard interpretation which you have chosen to attack
     is distinguished by one property which no other enumeration has: a
     simple arithmetic well-suited for the computers of our age. Addition,
     for example, can in the binary number system simply done as in the
     decimal system, except of course, that adding 1 to 1 yields 10, at any
     particular place."

    Can you see the Foundation, which would allow the presentation of the
    Contradiction? In other words, you can not perform the operation of
    addition on the equation "1 + 1", because this would equate to "10". But,
    isn't this a Numbering System that is Governed by the Elementary Laws of
    Mathematics and Logical reasoning, which must ultimately obey the Laws
    from the Field Postulates and Set Theory? Furthermore, when dealing with
    the Binary System, should it be considered to be governed by slightly
    different Arithmetic Operations, and have different Logical consistency
    from that of the Unary System? And what about the overall Arithmetic
    Operations pertaining to Mathematics itself, isn't this wrong there too?
    Well...If it is, then what was Gregor Cantor actually saying? Perhaps,
    what he was actually saying, was that; 'If you are wrong, and you are
    consistently wrong in what you are saying or doing, then you can make it
    look correct, because it is Consistent.' Nevertheless, in any case, the
    Argument has been made, and a gradual development of the foundation
    supporting the New Paradigm for the Binary Mathematics will be set forth
    in the succeeding chapters.



Chapter I: Another look at the New Binary Paradigm




    To establish the foundation, which would ultimately lead to the Final
    conclusion supporting the New Paradigm for the Binary System, and the
    "Contradiction", that would provide the necessary proof that the Modern
    Foundation is wrong. I must first provide a Table(s) Listing the related
    Numbering Systems, for comparison, and then reiterate parts of the Proof,
    which would allow the derivation of the New Paradigm for the Binary System.
    Where by, notice the Columns in Table 1A, each is a Representation of the
    same object, or each other, differing only in their Graphical Depiction:

    The examination of TABLE 1A, coupled with an understanding of the
    Elementary Operations for Addition in Binary Mathematics, the Laws from
    the Field Postulates, and Set Theory. Where it can be Clearly seen, that
    the Operation of Addition in the equation "1 + 1 = 10" is the
    "Contradiction", which is Not Violated Under the New Paradigm for the
    Binary System. Furthermore, I can also say, from its presentation, the
    Relationship between Columns '2' and '4' has been established as being
    Logically valid under the Rules and Laws, which govern the Field Postulates
    and Set Theory. And further state, it is also valid under the laws
    governing the Mathematics of Quantification. However, its proof, would be
    too taxing of a demand, which would require the knowledge of the
    Mathematics of Quantification. And in this case, it is totally unnecessary,
    because the Laws from Elementary Mathematics already has been shown to
    suffice for the establishment of the so called, "Proof by Contradiction"
    Argument, required by 'Mr. Perovic' response to the initial proof of the
    foundation, which established this New Paradigm for the Binary System. 




E Terrell                                                      [Page 8]

Quantification, New Paradigm, Re-Defines Binary Math   February 22, 2002



    In other words, 'Mr. Perovic' stated that the flaw in the Modern Method for
    Enumerating using Binary Notation, resulted from an Exception to the
    Mathematical Law Governing the Operation of Addition. That is, he stated;
    "...except of course, that adding 1 to 1 yields 10", which should be the
    Binary Notation that represents, or equals the Integer '3', provided at
    least one of the addends was a Binary Number. Furthermore, while the
    Argument can easily be closed, just from this little example, and of
    course, a comparison between Columns '2' and '4' from Table 1A, that would
    clearly establish the Method for Elementary Arithmetic Operations for this
    New Binary System...Still many would complain, regarding the missing rigor
    from the Logical Argument, which would unquestionably rule out any further
    opposition.

    Nevertheless, prior to beginning the development of the foundation, which
    would allow for the derivation of the Methods for the Elementary Arithmetic
    Operations, I must first reiterate the conclusions supporting the proof
    that established the Foundation for the New Model representing the Binary
    System.


    "...However, prior to any forthright Construction of Table Ic, following
    in sequence from Tables I, Ia, and Ib. It would facilitate the analysis of
    the logical argument, if we first reiterate the requirements that were
    logically developed, that established the foundational definitions and
    requirements, which would be the mandate for any Binary System to exist.



                              Binary Principles 


           1. Binary; Consisting of 2 Things, Elements, or Members.

           2. Zero and the Null Set are implied by the same definition

           3. Zero; Having no Quantity, Size, Members, or elements;
              representing a State of Condition of Nothingness.

           4. Binary Set; Consisting of 2 and only 2, Elements or Members.

           5. Union of Set; Combining the Elements or Members of 2 or more
              Sets, resulting in 1 Set containing the total, which represents
              the combined total of the Members from the initial Sets.

           6. 'Equality': A Relationship, which provides a means to establish
              an Identity between 2 or more Objects being compared.

           7. Binary Zero is represented by '00', since it is not empty, it
              is not equal to either the Zero Integer or the Null Set.

    Now if you are satisfied with the list of Principles derived from, and
    associated with the Binary System, with the exception of 7. We can
    construct Table Ic, which represents another view for the Modern Method
    of Binary Enumeration.



                             TABLE Ic

          Enumeration" Counting, using only "1's" and  "0's"

      Enumeration       Representation               Integer
      /    |     \       /   |     \                /   |   \


   1.   0^0 = 0        00000000  =  0                   0

   2.   2^0 = 1        00000001  =  01                  1

   3.   2^1 = 2        00000010  =  10                  2

   4.   2^F = 3        00000011  =  11                  3

   5.   2^2 = 4        00000100  =  100                 4

   6.   2^F = 5        00000101  =  101                 5
 
   7.   2^F = 6        00000110  =  110                 6








    Notice that Table Ic maintains the 'One-to-One' validity as Table IIa.
    However, as with Tables I and II, their differences remain the same. In
    fact, any comparison with Table IIa maintains the same validity, except
    for their different starting points. In other words, Table Ic and Table
    IIa are 2 distinct Numbering Systems, that use the Binary Notation in a
    'One-to-One Pairing' with the Integers to define and establish equality.

    "Do we now have 2 Binary Systems, establishing a slightly different, and
    yet, equal relationship with the Set of Integers? I mean, what do we have
    here? Is it possible to have 2 distinct Binary Systems, whose difference
    represents a different 'One-to-One Pairing' with the Integers? Or are we
    to try once again, and decide, which one of the two Numbering Systems
    actually represents a True Binary System?"

    Following the same investigative analysis used in earlier chapters, we can
    depict this difference graphically. That is, if we were now to extrapolate
    from the respective Binary Notations, as it would be given by the Integers'
    additive method of progression, which produces the counting series using
    successive additions of 1. We could then generate a number line, denoting
    a 'One-to-One Mapping' with the Integers that would more accurately depict
    these noted distinctions. Given respectively by figures 3 and 4, we have:

    What the bottom row of numbers actually represents, is the total number of
    combinations, which will be generated from the Binary Set, {0,1}. However,
    these combinations are used in a way similar to the way the '1' is used in
    the Integers, which increments from right to left using and changing only
    the ' 0 or 1' notations from the Binary Set to generate a series of Binary
    Numbers. In other words, they generate a series governed by the operation
    of addition. That is, given respectively by figures 5 and 6, we have:

    Well, how do you begin your count? I mean, if there are 5 objects to be
    counted, would your count start with 'Zero' or 'One'? Clearly, the Set of
    Integers from which the Counting Numbers were derived, was only a graphical
    depiction, to be used in such a way, as to render a picture of the Number
    to be represented, which used one or more of these members to achieve the
    desired result. And nothing more. In other words, the Set of Integers or
    Whole Numbers, maintains the additional distinction of being a short-hand
    representation for the Operation of Addition, from which the sequence of
    Numbers is derived from the Unary Set {1}.

    Furthermore, I am sure you observed from figure 5, that the equating of
    Binary Zero to the Integer Zero reduced the number of combinations
    resulting from the Binary Set. Which is actually the cause which produces
    the SHIFT in the 'One-to-One Pairing' with the Integers. I mean, the
    assignment of the Beginning Point for any Numbering Systems is very
    important, because it sets the starting point that will be used for
    counting.

    Moreover, further analysis of the resulting Combinations derived from both
    of the respective Binary Sets, using Tables Ic and IIa. Clearly shows the
    equality existing between each of these Sets, which is derived from the
    'One-to-One Pairing' equating the Points on the Number Line, denoting the
    Integers, with the Binary Notations they respectively represent. If
    however, we mapped the results indicated by figures 5 and 6, using the
    respective mappings given by figures 3 and 4, we would establish the
    necessary proof for concluding, that the method derived for Counting using
    the Modern Interpretation is wrong. In other words, any 'One-to-One
    Mapping' with the Integers and the Combinations resulting from figures 5
    and 6, would clearly show that the missing Set, given by the Combination
    {00}, would result in a inaccurate mapping denoting an Inequality with
    the Sequence of Counting Numbers derived from the Set of Integers; that is,
    the Set of Counting Numbers denoted by: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}. In which
    case, the Universal Set " I ", for the Integers, would equal the Set
    denoted by:

               

                                 Fig 7.    

                 
                  x|x is an element of I = Integers
      { {...-10,...-5,-4,-3,-2,-1}  {0}  {1,2,3,4,5,...,10} }


    Where its number line mapping is given by:

     -10 + -9 ... -5 +... -2 + -1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 ... 5 +... + 10 





    Nevertheless, the System of counting presently being used is a UNARY
    System, from which the sequence of Counting begins with the Number '1',
    and continues its progression using successive additions of the Number
    '1' to derive the next or succeeding numbers. And while it maybe called
    or labeled as being something different (i.e. Decimal System), it is
    nevertheless Unary. Furthermore, while Zero, '0', is used in every
    Numbering System (denoting its' universal application), it is not itself,
    a Number. It is only a symbolic notation, which represents emptiness, or
    lack of an Object to which it refers. Hence, Binary by definition, means
    '2', and nothing more. Therefore, when considering the construction of any
    Numbering System that employs or uses Binary Notation, we must first
    realize that the first '4' numbers are derived from the Total Number of
    Possible Unique Combinations, which are related to and derived from, the
    Sequenced Numbers or Elements depicted as being Members of the Binary Set.
    And further conclude, that all other succeeding Binary Numbers are derived
    from these Combinations. In which case, since the Binary Set equals {0,1},
    the total number of Unique Combinations equals the set {00, 01, 10, 11},
    which respectively represents the first '4' Binary Numbers whose mapping
    with the Set of Integers starts with the Number '1'.


    Hence, the Correct Method for Enumeration in the Binary System is given
    by the Results displayed in Table IIa, and the Modern Interpretation for
    the Method of Enumeration in the Binary System is clearly wrong. But still,
    both methods clearly represent a Binary System. Notwithstanding however,
    while the conclusions derived with respect to each of these Systems remains
    unquestionably valid. It does not stop, nor prevent any decision regarding
    choice. In other words, for whatever reason, right or wrong, for now at
    least, it does not matter which Binary System is used. Because other than
    myself, no one has, or is capable of completing the necessary studies
    indicating some out come producing a harm, resulting from the effects for
    choosing the wrong System."

Chapter II: Developing the Mathematical Foundation for Arithmetic Operations


    First and foremost, it should be pointed out, that while the Numbers in
    Binary Notation, as represented in Column '2', from Table 1A, are
    derived from the total number of Unique Combinations, which equals the set
    {00, 01, 10, 11}, and that they respectively represent the first '4'
    Binary Numbers whose mapping with the Set of Integers starts with the
    Number '1'. However, any further comparison of Columns '2' and '4' also
    reveals, that they are 'Incremented' or 'De-Incremented' using the same
    methods as those governing the Unary Set. That is, while the sequence of
    Counting does not begin with the Number '1', as such. It uses Number '1' to
    derive a progression, which uses successive additions of the Number '1' to
    derive the next, and the succeeding numbers in Binary Notation. What this
    actually means, or implies, is that, by definition, there can exist only
    '4' Numbers, which can be derived from the, and said to members of, the
    'BINARY SET'. Everything else is a Synthetic Creation, which facilitates
    enumeration beyond a count of '4'. In which case, the 'Unary Set' contains
    only '1' Member, and all other numerals results from some combination,
    which builds upon, and are related to, the number '1'.   

    Furthermore, while this process is clearly depicted in Table 1A, any
    questions concerning the validity of such an Operation are easily
    quelled using the 'Axioms for Equality', which are derived from the Laws
    governing the Basic Arithmetic Operations of Elementary Mathematics. And
    in this particular case, the Elementary Mathematical Law of Governance, is
    the 'Substitution Law for Equality, which states; "If A = B, then A may be
    replaced by B, and B by A, in any Mathematical Statement without altering
    the Truth or Falsity of the statement." What this means, and is represented
    in Table 1A, is that, since {00} = {1}, then {00} may be replaced by {1},
    and {1} by {00}, in any Mathematical Statement without changing or altering
    the value of the Mathematical Statement itself.  

    Nevertheless, I will not extend the argument beyond the Elementary
    Operations, which deal specifically with Addition and Subtraction, because
    these operations completely suffice in not only establishing the necessary
    proof, but clearly represents the ease and elegance of the Mathematical
    Operations, which represents the New Paradigm for the Binary Set. Not to
    mention, that it would be redundant to proceed any further, because the
    Modern Interpretation for Representing the Operation of Addition, in the
    Current Binary Set Notation, Fails the TEST, when one attempts to solve the
    Equation "1 + 1 = 10"... Which is valid enough, to establish the necessary
    proof, especially since it does not yield an equivalent integer
    representation. In other words, it does not represent the integer '3' from
    a Binary Translation, and serves only to raise more questions regarding our
    present mathematical and logical concerns.

    Nonetheless, if you are satisfied, and I sincerely hope that you are, we
    can, by example and comparison using Table 1A, show examples of Addition
    and Subtraction using the New Paradigm, which represents the Real Binary
    System.

    Please note, when observing Table 1A, specifically Column '2', you should
    notice that the Progression beyond the Number represented by '00',
    'Increments' the next Number by the same amount shown in Column '4',
    which represent the Number, or Integer, '1' under Column '3'. Where by,
    the Operation of Addition is given in Table 2A, and the Operation of
    Subtraction is shown in Table 3A:

    Clearly, Tables 2A and 3A provides an adequate representation for the
    Elementary Mathematical Operations of Addition and Subtraction, which can
    be easily verified using Table 1A, and hence, quells all further doubts
    about the Logic, and or Mathematical Operations that encompass the New
    Paradigm representing the Binary System. Furthermore, it can be easily
    shown, that the even more Complicated Mathematical Operations representing
    Multiplication and Division would follow the similar presentation. In other
    words, the conclusion representing the foundation, which Established this
    New Paradigm for the Binary System, remain unquestionably valid. And
    without a doubt, Gregor Cantor was truly wrong, regarding his conclusions.
    That is, this New Paradigm represents the True Binary Mathematical
    Operations... Where by, in the New Binary Mathematics, the Mathematics for
    the Binary Numbers and the Binary Logic is the same; Given by Equations '1'
    thru '5', noted below...We have:

                                     and "01 + 00 = 10".

                  5.  10 + 00 = 11 : In the New Binary Mathematics





    But, this pattern only follows the Unary Set for Progression, or
    Regression, which pertains to the value given by the Unary Set, {1}.
    Nevertheless, there is, contrary to the out spoken beliefs, a Binary
    Equivalent, which is performed first upon the Right Most Binary Pair;
    where {XX} would represent the Right most Binary Digit. Now! Keeping in
    mind that this is Pure Binary Mathematics that we will be dealing with. It
    should be understood, its' Rules will be somewhat different. Where by, in
    Pure Binary Mathematics, whether or not you are working with a Pair of
    Columns or a Single Column, something is always Carried to the Next Column,
    (or is understood to represent a particular Binary Value) provided that
    the Next Column Exist. In other words, in Pure Binary Mathematics, either
    a "1" or a "0" will Carry Over to the Next Column. And depending upon the
    Binary Value of the Digit in the Next Column, being either a "0" or a "1".
    And whether or not you are working with either a Single, Double, or some
    Multiple Column Arithmetic, will determine how the Carry will effect the
    Mathematics. To be more specific, the Digit being Carried is Governed by
    the equations given below (And Note, I will only be performing Single
    Column Mathematics);



                            1. 0 + 1 = 10, where "1" Carry to "0" means use
                                           "0" in the Current Column and
                                           Carry the "1" to the Next Digit.

                            2. 1 + 1 = 11, where "1" Carry to "1" means use
                                           "1" in the Current Column and
                                           Carry the "1" to the Next Digit.


                            3. 0 + 0 = 1,  where "0" Carry to "0" means use
                                           "0", (0 + 0 = 1) in the Current
                                           Column and Carry the "0" to the
                                           Next Digit; In which case, the
                                           Carry of "0" to "1" equals "10",
                                           and Carry "0" to "0" Equals "0";
                                           given by Table 1A, we have
                                           "00" = "1".

 

    The explanation for these results is given by the Results from the
    equations given below, and are respectively labeled as '1a' and '2a'.



                           1a. 00 + 01 = 10


                           2a. 01 + 01 = 11


                           3a. 00 + 00 = 01


                           4a. 10 + 00 = 11





    Now Observe Equations '1a', '2a', "3a' and '4a', when the Right most
    Digit is Stripped away, which yields Equations '1b', '2b', '3b', and
    '4b', and stripping the Left Most Digit yields equations '1c, '2c,
    '3c', and '4c'. These Equations are said to be the Equations
    establishing the fundamental Mathematical Operations for Binary Logic,
    which would represent the "AND OPERATION"; Given by Table 1B, We have:

    And these respective Arithmetic examples are representations of the "AND"
    Function, the "NOT" function can just as easily be deduced using the same

    Furthermore, it should be understood that the Arithmetic Operation of
    Subtraction follows the same Rules Derived for Addition, but Effect is
    the Reverse, which yields an Opposite result. Where by, Given by Table
    Ex. 2a, we have:

          Rules provided above.

    Needless to say, the "CONTRADICTION" now becomes the "CONFLICT",
    which is the Difference between the Mathematics pertaining to the Binary
    System itself, and the Mathematics for the Binary Logic associated with the
    Binary System. In other words, there is No Such Thing as a Derivation of a
    "Contradiction", 'Proof or Otherwise', within a Newly Created, or Logically
    Derived Numbering System. Because it can only be said to either violate the
    Standing Laws which Support it, or it Violates the Newly Derived
    Definitions, which are said to Define it. And in this case, the proof is
    derived from the conclusion; 'There is No Correlation between the total
    number of Unique Combinations which equals or depicts the Numerals
    Contained in the Modern Binary Set ({00, 01, 10, 11}), that is used to
    develop the Mathematics for, and is derived from, Binary Enumeration, which
    was logically derived from the Unary Set'. Hence, Zero once again, regains
    its Independence, the inherent Neutrality, which is the Property or Status
    belonging only to Zero; ÊThe Distinction of the Zero Property regarding
    it∆s inherent Neutrality, by definition, sets it apart from every Numbering
    System, or System of Counting∆.
    
    Nevertheless, this "Contradiction" with the Mathematics for the Modern
    Binary System, is a "CONFLICT" within the Binary System itself, which does
    not exist in the New Paradigm, that represents the New Model for the Binary
    System. Hence, there is Only One Logically Valid Binary System, and while
    anyone can create up to '4' New Binary System Representations, they would
    not All be Logically Valid. And Equally True, there is Only One Unary
    System, but it can not be Extended in any way, that would provide, or
    produce some other Alternatives, as seen in the Binary System. 





Chapter III: The Mathematics of Quantification; Spectacles for Viewing
                 the Mathematical Possibilities 


    Nevertheless, whether or not you are familiar with Quantification, it
    should be clear, since its mention, The power of the Mathematics of
    Quantification is indeed daunting, and it should reign over the Entire
    Mathematical Field forever, without question. In fact, I am currently
    working on more of its promises, which includes the Subjects listed below. 
    Moreover, it should be an added value to note, accomplishments in these
    areas would lead to 'Autonomous Machines', which could actually 'Think'.
    (eg.: Computers, Probes, Space Vehicles, Medical Devices for Diagnoses,
     Robotics, and Independent, 'Thinking Weapons of Mass Destruction' that
     can be used either 'Offensively' or 'Defensively',... etc.)

    And while it should be understood, I definitely have my work cut out for
    me. It should be equally clear, that time does not always permit an
    explanation of the Elementary Concepts, which should be well understood
    by the Professionals who populate the intended Area of Study / Research.

    Notwithstanding, the joys I derive from my work in the field of
    Mathematics, my actual objective is indeed the Natural Sciences, and
    perhaps the Engineering Sciences as well. But clearly, it is doubtful,
    that any of these works will every find as their home, the postings of
    the IETF's Web Page. Needless to say, they would indeed be well beyond
    the scope of the audience, who frequents Internet-Draft's Web Pages for the
    latest information regarding the standards governing Computer Technology.   

    And for this, I sincerely apologize.





    Chapter IV: Security Considerations



   This document, whose only objective was the explanation of the
   new foundation for the Binary System, which resulted from the Mathematics
   of Quantification, does not directly raise any security issues. Hence,
   there are no issues that warrant Security Considerations.
