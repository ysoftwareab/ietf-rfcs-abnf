   Evolution of Utility Telecom Networks

   The business and technology trends that are sweeping the utility
   industry will drastically transform the utility business from the way
   it has been for many decades.  At the core of many of these changes
   is a drive to modernize the electrical grid with an integrated
   communications infrastructure.  However, interoperability, concerns,
   legacy networks, disparate tools, and stringent security requirements
   all add complexity to grid transformation.  Given the range and
   diversity of the requirement that should be addressed by the next
   generation telecommunications infrastructure utilities need to adopt
   a holistic architectural approach to integrate the electrical grid
   with digital communication across the entire power delivery chain.

   Many utilities still rely on complex environments formed of multiple
   application-specific, proprietary networks.  Information is siloed
   between operational areas.  This prevents utility operations from
   realizing the operational efficiency benefits, visibility, and
   functional integration of operational information across grid
   applications and data networks.  The key to modernizing grid
   communications is to provide a common, multi-service network
   infrastructure for the entire utility organization.  Such a network
   serves as the platform for current capabilities while enabling future
   expansion of the network to accommodate new applications and
   services.

   To meet this diverse set of requirements, both today and in the
   future, the next generation utility telecom network will be based on
   open-standards-based IP architecture.  An end-to-end IP architecture
   takes advantage of nearly three decades of IP technology development,
   facilitating interoperability across disparate networks and devices,
   as it has been already demonstrated in many mission-critical and
   highly secure networks.

   IEC and the different National Committees have mandated a specific
   adhoc group (AHG8) to define the migration strategy to IPv6 for all
   the IEC TC57 power automation standards.  IPv6 is seen as the obvious
   future communication technology for the Smart Grid.  The Adhoc Group
   will discose to the IEC coordination group, their conclusions end of
   2014.

   It is imperative that utilities participate in standards development
   bodies to influence the development of future solutions and to
   benefit from shared experiences of other utilities and vendors.

4.  Communication Trends and General Communication Requirements

   These general communication requirements are over and above the
   specific requirements of the use cases that have been addressed so
   far.  These include both current and future communication related
   requirements that should be factored into the network architecture
   and design.

4.1.1.  Migration to Packet-Switched Network

   Throughout the world, utilities are increasingly planning for a
   future based on smart grid applications requiring advanced
   telecommunications systems.  Many of these applications utilize
   packet connectivity for communicating information and control signals
   across the utility's Wide Area Network (WAN), made possible by
   technologies such as multiprotocol label switching (MPLS).  The data
   that traverses the utility WAN includes:

   o  Grid monitoring, control, and protection data

   o  Non-control grid data (e.g.  asset data for condition-based
      monitoring)

   o  Physical safety and security data (e.g.  voice and video)

   o  Remote worker access to corporate applications (voice, maps,
      schematics, etc.)

   o  Field area network backhaul for smart metering, and distribution
      grid management

   o  Enterprise traffic (email, collaboration tools, business
      applications)

   WANs support this wide variety of traffic to and from substations,
   the transmission and distribution grid, generation sites, between
   control centers, and between work locations and data centers.  To
   maintain this rapidly expanding set of applications, many utilities
   are taking steps to evolve present time-division multiplexing
   (TDM)based and frame relay infrastructures to packet systems.
   Packet-based networks are designed to provide greater functionalities
   and higher levels of service for applications, while continuing to
   deliver reliability and deterministic (real-time) traffic support.

4.2.  Applications, Use cases and traffic patterns

   Among the numerous applications and use cases that a utility deploys
   today, many rely on high availability and deterministic behaviour of
   the telecommunication networks.  Protection use cases and generation
   control are the most demanding and can't rely on a best effort
   approach.

4.2.1.  Transmission use cases

   Protection means not only the protection of the human operator but
   also the protection of the electric equipments and the preservation
   of the stability and frequency of the grid.  If a default occurs on
   the transmission or the distribution of the electricity, important
   damages could occured to the human operator but also to very costly
   electrical equipments and perturb the grid leading to blackouts.  The

Internet-DrafDeterministic Networking Utilities requirement October 2014

   time and reliability requirements are very strong to avoid dramatic
   impacts to the electrical infrastructure.

4.2.1.1.  Tele Protection

   The key criteria for measuring Teleprotection performance are command
   transmission time, dependability and security.  These criteria are
   defined by the IEC standard 60834 as follows:

   o  Transmission time (Speed): The time between the moment where state
      changes at the transmitter input and the moment of the
      corresponding change at the receiver output, including propagation
      time.  Overall operating time for a Teleprotection system includes
      the time for initiating the command at the transmitting end, the
      propagation time over the communications link and the selection
      and decision time at the receiving end, including any additional
      delay due to a noisy environment.

   o  Dependability: The ability to issue and receive valid commands in
      the presence of interference and/or noise, by minimizing the
      probability of missing command (PMC). Dependability targets are
      typically set for a specific bit error rate (BER) level.

   o  Security: The ability to prevent false tripping due to a noisy
      environment, by minimizing the probability of unwanted commands
      (PUC). Security targets are also set for a specific bit error rate
      (BER) level.

   Additional key elements that may impact Teleprotection performance
   include bandwidth rate of the Teleprotection system and its
   resiliency or failure recovery capacity.  Transmission time,
   bandwidth utilization and resiliency are directly linked to the
   communications equipment and the connections that are used to
   transfer the commands between relays.

4.2.1.1.1.  Latency Budget Consideration

   Delay requirements for utility networks may vary depending upon a
   number of parameters, such as the specific protection equipment used.
   Most power line equipment can tolerate short circuits or faults for
   up to approximately five power cycles before sustaining irreversible
   damage or affecting other segments in the network.  This translates
   to total fault clearance time of 100ms.  As a safety precaution,












Wetterwald & Raymond     Expires April 24, 2015                 [Page 6]

Internet-DrafDeterministic Networking Utilities requirement October 2014

   however, actual operation time of protection systems is limited to
   70- 80 percent of this period, including fault recognition time,
   command transmission time and line breaker switching time.  Some
   system components, such as large electromechanical switches, require
   particularly long time to operate and take up the majority of the
   total clearance time, leaving only a 10ms window for the
   communications part of the protection scheme, independent of the
   distance to travel.  Given the sensitivity of the issue, new networks
   impose requirements that are even more stringent: IEC standard 61850
   limits the transfer time for protection messages to 1/4 - 1/2 cycle
   or 4 - 8ms (for 60Hz lines) for the most critical messages

   The following diagram shows the latency budget for a fault clearing
   time of a protection system, divided by the different actors
   involved.

4.2.1.1.2.  Asymetric delay

   In addition to minimal transmission delay, a differential protection
   communication channel must be synchronous, i.e., experiencing
   symmetrical channel delay in transmit and receive paths.  This
   requires special attention in jitter-prone packet networks.  While
   optimally Teleprotection systems should support zero asymmetric
   delay, typical relays can tolerate discrepancies of up to 750us.

   The main tools available for lowering delay variation below this
   threshold are:

   o  A jitter buffer at the multiplexers on each end of the line can be
      used to offset delay variation by queuing sent and received
      packets.  The length of the queues must balance the need to
      regulate the rate of transmission with the need to limit overall
      delay, as larger buffers result in increased latency.  This is the
      old TDM traditional way to fulfill this requirement.

   o  Traffic management tools ensure that the Teleprotection signals
      receive the highest transmission priority and minimize the number
      of jitter addition during the path.  This is one way to meet the
      requirement in IP networks.

   o  Standard Packet-Based synchronization technologies, such as
      1588-2008 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) and Synchronous Ethernet
      (Sync-E), can help maintain stable networks by keeping a highly
      accurate clock source on the different network devices involved.

4.2.1.1.2.1.  Other traffic caracteristics

   o  Redundancy: The existence in a system of more than one means of
      accomplishing a given function

   o  Recovery time : it's the duration of time within which a business
      process must be restored after any type of disruption in order to
      avoid unacceptable consequences associated with a break in


Wetterwald & Raymond     Expires April 24, 2015                 [Page 7]

Internet-DrafDeterministic Networking Utilities requirement October 2014

      business continuity.

   o  performance management : In networking, a management function
      defined for controlling and analyzing different parameters/metrics
      such as the throughput, error rate

   o  packet loss : one or more packets of data travelling across
      network fail to reach their destination

4.2.1.1.2.2.  Teleprotection network requirements

   The following table captures the main network requirements (this is
   based on IEC 61850 standard)

4.2.1.2.  Inter-Trip Protection scheme

   Inter-tripping is the controlled tripping of a circuit breaker to
   complete the isolation of a circuit or piece of apparatus in concert
   with the tripping of other circuit breakers.  The main use of such
   schemes is to ensure that protection at both ends of a faulted
   circuit will operate to isolate the equipment concerned.  Inter-
   tripping schemes use signaling to convey a trip command to remote
   circuit breakers to isolate circuits.

4.2.1.3.  Current Differential Protection Scheme

   Current differential protection is commonly used for line protection,
   and is typical for protecting parallel circuits.  A main advantage
   for differential protection is that, compared to overcurrent
   protection, it allows only the faulted circuit to be de-energized in
   case of a fault.  At both end of the lines, the current is measured
   by the differential relays, and based on Kirchhoff's law, both relays
   will trip the circuit breaker if the current going into the line does
   not equal the current going out of the line.  This type of protection
   scheme assumes some form of communication being present between the
   relays at both end of the line, to allow both relays to compare
   measured current values.  A fault in line 1, will cause overcurrent
   to be flowing in both lines, but because the current in line 2 is a
   through following current, this current is measured equal at both
   ends of the line, therefore the differential relays on line 2 will
   not trip line 2. Line 1 will be tripped, as the relays will not
   measure the same currents at both ends of the line.  Line
   differential protection schemes assume a very low communications
   delay between both relays, often as low as 5ms.  Moreover, as those
   systems are often not time-synchronized, they also assume symmetric
   communications paths with constant delay, which allows comparing
   current measurement values taken at the exact same time.

4.2.1.4.  Distance Protection Scheme

   Distance (Impedance Relay) protection scheme is based on voltage and
   current measurements.  A fault on a circuit will generally create a
   sag in the voltage level.  If the ratio of voltage to current
   measured at the protection relay terminals, which equates to an
   impedance element, falls within a set threshold the circuit breaker
   will operate.  The operating characteristics of this protection are
   based on the line characteristics.  This means that when a fault
   appears on the line, the impedance setting in the relay is compared
   to the apparent impedance of the line from the relay terminals to the
   fault.  If the relay setting is determined to be below the apparent
   impedance it is determined that the fault is within the zone of
   protection.  When the transmission line length is under a minimum
   length distance protection becomes more difficult to coordinate.  In
   these instances the best choice of protection is current differential
   protection.

   This use case describes the exchange of Sampled Value or GOOSE
   message between IEDs in two substations for protection and tripping
   coordination.  The two IEDs are in a master-slave mode.

   The CT/VT in one substation sends the sampled analog voltage or
   current value to the Merging Unit (MU) over hard wire.  The merging
   unit sends the time-synchronized 61850-9-2 sampled values to the
   slave IED. The slave IED forwards the information to the Master IED
   in the other substation.  The master IED makes the determination (for
   example based on sampled value differentials) to send a trip command
   to the originating IED. Once the slave IED/Relay receives the GOOSE
   trip for breaker tripping, it opens the breaker.  It then sends a
   confirmation message back to the master.  All data exchanges between
   IEDs are either through Sampled Value or GOOSE messages.

   substation send the sampled value (analog voltage or current) to the
   Merging Unit (MU) over hard wire.  The merging unit sends the time-
   synchronized 61850-9-2 sampled values to the IEDs in the substation
   in GOOSE message format.  The GPS Master Clock can send 1PPS or
   IRIG-B format to MU through serial port, or IEEE 1588 protocol via

   network.  Process bus communication using 61850 simplifies
   connectivity within the substation and removes the requirement for
   multiple serial connections and removes the slow serial bus
   architectures that are typically used.  This also ensures increased
   flexibility and increased speed with the use of multicast messaging

4.2.1.7.  Wide Area Monitoring and Control Systems

   The application of synchrophasor measurement data from Phasor
   Measurement Units (PMU) to Wide Area Monitoring and Control Systems
   promises to provide important new capabilities for improving system
   stability.  Access to PMU data enables more timely situational
   awareness over larger portions of the grid than what has been
   possible historically with normal SCADA data.  Handling the volume
   and real-time nature of synchrophasor data presents unique challenges
   for existing application architectures.  Wide Area management System
   (WAMS) makes it possible for the condition of the bulk power system
   to be observed and understood in real-time so that protective,
   preventative, or corrective action can be taken.  Because of the very
   high sampling rate of measurements and the strict requirement for
   time synchronization of the samples, WAMS has stringent communication
   requirements in an IP network that are captured in the following
   table:

4.2.2.  Distribution use case

4.2.2.1.  Fault Location Isolation and Service Restoration (FLISR)

   As the name implies, Fault Location, Isolation, and Service
   Restoration (FLISR) refers to the ability to automatically locate the
   fault, isolate the fault, and restore service in the distribution
   network.  It is a self-healing feature whose purpose is to minimize
   the impact of faults by serving portions of the loads on the affected
   circuit by switching to other circuits.  It reduces the number of
   customers that experience a sustained power outage by reconfiguring
   distribution circuits.  This will likely be the first wide spread
   application of distributed intelligence in the grid.  Secondary
   substations can be connected to multiple primary substations.
   Normally, static power switch statuses (open/closed) in the network
   dictate the power flow to secondary substations.  Reconfiguring the
   network in the event of a fault is typically done manually on site to
   operate switchgear to energize/de-energize alternate paths.
   Automating the operation of substation switchgear allows the utility
   to have a more dynamic network where the flow of power can be altered
   under fault conditions but also during times of peak load.  It allows
   the utility to shift peak loads around the network.  Or, to be more
   precise, alters the configuration of the network to move loads
   between different primary substations.  The FLISR capability can be
   enabled in two modes:

   o  Managed centrally from DMS, or

   o  Executed locally through distributed control via intelligent
      switches and fault sensors.

   There are 3 distinct sub-functions that are performed:




Wetterwald & Raymond     Expires April 24, 2015                [Page 13]

Internet-DrafDeterministic Networking Utilities requirement October 2014


   1.      Fault Location Identification This sub-function is initiated
   by SCADA inputs, such as lockouts, fault indications/location, and,
   also, by input from the Outage Management System (OMS), and in the
   future by inputs from fault-predicting devices.  It determines the
   specific protective device, which has cleared the sustained fault,
   identifies the de-energized sections, and estimates the probable
   location of the actual or the expected fault.  It distinguishes
   faults cleared by controllable protective devices from those cleared
   by fuses, and identifies momentary outages and inrush/cold load pick-
   up currents.  This step is also referred to as Fault Detection
   Classification and Location (FDCL). This step helps to expedite the
   restoration of faulted sections through fast fault location
   identification and improved diagnostic information available for crew
   dispatch.  Also provides visualization of fault information to design
   and implement a switching plan to isolate the fault.

   2.      Fault Type Determination

   I.      Indicates faults cleared by controllable protective devices
   by distinguishing between:

   a.      Faults cleared by fuses

   b.      Momentary outages

   c.      Inrush/cold load current

   II.     Determines the faulted sections based on SCADA fault
   indications and protection lockout signals

   III.    Increases the accuracy of the fault location estimation based
   on SCADA fault current measurements and real-time fault analysis

   3.      Fault Isolation and Service Restoration

   Once the location and type of the fault has been pinpointed the
   systems will attempt to isolate the fault and restore the non-faulted
   section of the network.  This can have three modes of operation:

   I.      Closed-loop mode : This is initiated by the Fault location
   sub-function.  It generates a switching order (i.e., sequence of
   switching) for the remotely controlled switching devices to isolate
   the faulted section, and restore service to the non-faulted sections.
   The switching order is automatically executed via SCADA.

   II.     Advisory mode : This is initiated by the Fault location sub-
   function.  It generates a switching order for remotely and manually
   controlled switching devices to isolate the faulted section, and
   restore service to the non-faulted sections.  The switching order is
   presented to operator for approval and execution




Wetterwald & Raymond     Expires April 24, 2015                [Page 14]

Internet-DrafDeterministic Networking Utilities requirement October 2014


   III.    Study mode : the operator initiates this function.  It
   analyzes a saved case modified by the operator, and generates a
   switching order under the operating conditions specified by the
   operator.

   With the increasing volume of data that are collected through fault
   sensors utilities will be to use Big Data query and analysis tools to
   study outage information to anticipate and prevent outages by
   detecting failure patterns and their correlation with asset age,
   type, load profiles, time of day, weather conditions, and other
   conditions to discover conditions that lead to faults and take the
   necessary preventive and corrective measures.

4.2.3.  Generation use case

4.2.3.1.  Frequency Control / Automatic Generation Control (AGC)

   The system frequency should be maintained within a very narrow band.
   Deviations from the acceptable frequency range are detected and
   forwarded to the Load Frequency Control (LFC) system so that required
   up or down generation increase / decrease pulses can be sent to the
   power plants for frequency regulation.  The trend in system frequency
   is a measure of mismatch between demand and generation, and is a
   necessary parameter for load control in interconnected systems.

   Automatic generation control (AGC) is a system for adjusting the
   power output of generators at different power plants, in response to
   changes in the load.  Since a power grid requires that generation and
   load closely balance moment by moment, frequent adjustments to the
   output of generators are necessary.  The balance can be judged by
   measuring the system frequency; if it is increasing, more power is
   being generated than used, and all machines in the system are
   accelerating.  If the system frequency is decreasing, more demand is



Wetterwald & Raymond     Expires April 24, 2015                [Page 15]

Internet-DrafDeterministic Networking Utilities requirement October 2014

   on the system than the instantaneous generation can provide, and all
   generators are slowing down.

   Where the grid has tie lines to adjacent control areas, automatic
   generation control helps maintain the power interchanges over the tie
   lines at the scheduled levels.  The AGC takes into account various
   parameters including the most economical units to adjust, the
   coordination of thermal, hydroelectric, and other generation types,
   and even constraints related to the stability of the system and
   capacity of interconnections to other power grids.

   For the purpose of AGC we use static frequency measurements and
   averaging methods are used to get a more precise measure of system
   frequency in steady-state conditions.

   During disturbances, more real-time dynamic measurements of system
   frequency are taken using PMUs, especially when different areas of
   the system exhibit different frequencies.  But that is outside the
   scope of this use case.

4.3.  Specific Network topologies of Smart Grid Applications

   Utilities often have very large private telecommunications networks.
   It covers an entire territory / country.  The main purpose of the
   network, until now, has been to support transmission network
   monitoring, control, and automation, remote control of generation
   sites, and providing FCAPS services from centralized network
   operation centers.











Wetterwald & Raymond     Expires April 24, 2015                [Page 16]

Internet-DrafDeterministic Networking Utilities requirement October 2014


   Going forward, one network will support operation and maintenance of
   electrical networks (generation, transmission, and distribution),
   voice and data services for ten of thousands of employees and for
   exchange with neighboring interconnections, and administrative
   services.  To meet those requirements, utility may deploy several
   physical networks leveraging different technologies across the
   country: an optical network and a microwave network for instance.
   Each protection and automatism system between two points has two
   communication circuits, one on each network.  Path diversity between
   two substations is key.  Regardless of the event type (hurricane, ice
   storm, etc.), one path shall stay available so the SPS can still
   operate.  This is to meet a mandatory NERC requirement.

   In the optical network, signals are transmitted over more than tens
   of thousands of circuits using fiber optic links, microwave and
   telephone cables.  This network is the nervous system of the
   utility's power transmission operations.  The optical network
   represents ten of thousands of km of cable deployed along the power
   lines.

   Due to vast distances between transmission substations (as far as
   280km apart), the fiber signal is amplified to reach a distance of
   280 km without attenuation.

4.3.1.  Precision Time Protocol

   Some utilities do not use GPS clocks in generation substations.  One
   of the main reasons is that some of the generation plants are 30 to
   50 meters deep under ground and the GPS signal can be weak and
   unreliable.  Instead, atomic clocks are used.  Clocks are
   synchronized amongst each other.  Rubidium clocks provide clock and
   1ms timestamps for IRIG-B. Some companies plan to transition to the
   Precision Time Protocol (IEEE 1588), distributing the synchronization
   signal over the IP/MPLS network.

   The Precision Time Protocol (PTP) is defined in IEEE standard 1588.
   PTP is applicable to distributed systems consisting of one or more
   nodes, communicating over a network.  Nodes are modeled as containing
   a real-time clock that may be used by applications within the node
   for various purposes such as generating time-stamps for data or
   ordering events managed by the node.  The protocol provides a
   mechanism for synchronizing the clocks of participating nodes to a
   high degree of accuracy and precision.

   PTP operates based on the following assumptions  :

      It is assumed that the network eliminates cyclic forwarding of PTP
      messages within each communication path (e.g., by using a spanning
      tree protocol). PTP eliminates cyclic forwarding of PTP messages
      between communication paths.

      PTP is tolerant of an occasional missed message, duplicated
      message, or message that arrived out of order.  However, PTP
      assumes that such impairments are relatively rare.

      PTP was designed assuming a multicast communication model.  PTP
      also supports a unicast communication model as long as the
      behavior of the protocol is preserved.

      Like all message-based time transfer protocols, PTP time accuracy
      is degraded by asymmetry in the paths taken by event messages.
      Asymmetry is not detectable by PTP, however, if known, PTP
      corrects for asymmetry.

   A time-stamp event is generated at the time of transmission and
   reception of any event message.  The time-stamp event occurs when the
   message?s timestamp point crosses the boundary between the node and
   the network.

6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  Current Practices and Their Limitations

   Grid monitoring and control devices are already targets for cyber
   attacks and legacy communication protocols have many intrinsic
   network related vulnerabilities.  DNP3, Modbus, PROFIBUS/PROFINET,
   and other protocols are designed around a common paradigm of request
   and respond.  Each protocol is designed for a master device such as
   an HMI system to send commands to subordinate slave devices to
   retrieve data (reading inputs) or control (writing to outputs).
   Because many of these protocols lack authentication, encryption, or
   other basic security measures, they are prone to network-based
   attacks, allowing a malicious actor or attacker to utilize the
   request-and-respond system as a mechanism for command-and-control
   like functionality.  Specific security concerns common to most
   industrial control, including utility communication protocols include
   the following:

   o  Network or transport errors (e.g.  malformed packets or excessive
      latency) can cause protocol failure.

   o  Protocol commands may be available that are capable of forcing
      slave devices into inoperable states, including powering-off
      devices, forcing them into a listen-only state, disabling
      alarming.

   o  Protocol commands may be available that are capable of restarting
      communications and otherwise interrupting processes.

   o  Protocol commands may be available that are capable of clearing,
      erasing, or resetting diagnostic information such as counters and
      diagnostic registers.

   o  Protocol commands may be available that are capable of requesting
      sensitive information about the controllers, their configurations,
      or other need-to-know information.

   o  Most protocols are application layer protocols transported over
      TCP; therefore it is easy to transport commands over non-standard
      ports or inject commands into authorized traffic flows.

   o  Protocol commands may be available that are capable of
      broadcasting messages to many devices at once (i.e.  a potential
      DoS).

   o  Protocol commands may be available to query the device network to
      obtain defined points and their values (i.e.  a configuration
      scan).

   o  Protocol commands may be available that will list all available
      function codes (i.e.  a function scan).

   o  Bump in the wire (BITW) solutions : A hardware device is added to
      provide IPSec services between two routers that are not capable of
      IPSec functions.  This special IPsec device will intercept then
      intercept outgoing datagrams, add IPSec protection to them, and
      strip it off incoming datagrams.  BITW can all IPSec to legacy
      hosts and can retrofit non-IPSec routers to provide security
      benefits.  The disadvantages are complexity and cost.

   These inherent vulnerabilities, along with increasing connectivity
   between IT an OT networks, make network-based attacks very feasible.
   Simple injection of malicious protocol commands provides control over
   the target process.  Altering legitimate protocol traffic can also
   alter information about a process and disrupt the legitimate controls
   that are in place over that process.  A man- in-the-middle attack
   could provide both control over a process and misrepresentation of
   data back to operator consoles.

6.2.  Security Trends in Utility Networks

   Although advanced telecommunication networks can assist in
   transforming the energy industry, playing a critical role in
   maintaining high levels of reliability, performance, and
   manageability, they also introduce the need for an integrated
   security infrastructure.  Many of the technologies being deployed to
   support smart grid projects such as smart meters and sensors can
   increase the vulnerability of the grid to attack.  Top security
   concerns for utilities migrating to an intelligent smart grid
   communications platform center on the following trends:

   o  Integration of distributed energy resources

Wetterwald & Raymond     Expires April 24, 2015                [Page 19]

Internet-DrafDeterministic Networking Utilities requirement October 2014


   o  Proliferation of digital devices to enable management, automation,
      protection, and control

   o  Regulatory mandates to comply with standards for critical
      infrastructure protection

   o  Migration to new systems for outage management, distribution
      automation, condition-based maintenance, load forecasting, and
      smart metering

   o  Demand for new levels of customer service and energy management

   This development of a diverse set of networks to support the
   integration of microgrids, open-access energy competition, and the
   use of network-controlled devices is driving the need for a converged
   security infrastructure for all participants in the smart grid,
   including utilities, energy service providers, large commercial and
   industrial, as well as residential customers.  Securing the assets of
   electric power delivery systems, from the control center to the
   substation, to the feeders and down to customer meters, requires an
   end-to-end security infrastructure that protects the myriad of
   communication assets used to operate, monitor, and control power flow
   and measurement.  Cyber security refers to all the security issues in
   automation and communications that affect any functions related to
   the operation of the electric power systems.  Specifically, it
   involves the concepts of:

   o  Integrity : data cannot be altered undetectably

   o  Authenticity : the communication parties involved must be
      validated as genuine

   o  Authorization : only requests and commands from the authorized
      users can be accepted by the system

   o  Confidentiality : data must not be accessible to any
      unauthenticated users

   When designing and deploying new smart grid devices and communication
   systems, it's imperative to understand the various impacts of these
   new components under a variety of attack situations on the power
   grid.  Consequences of a cyber attack on the grid telecommunication
   network can be catastrophic.  This is why security for smart grid is
   not just an ad hoc feature or product, it's a complete framework
   integrating both physical and Cyber security requirements and
   covering the entire smart grid networks from generation to
   distribution.  Security has therefore become one of the main
   foundations of the utility telecom network architecture and must be
   considered at every layer with a defense-in-depth approach.
   Migrating to IP based protocols is key to address these challenges
   for two reasons: 1.        IP enables a rich set of features and
   capabilities to enhance the security posture 2.   IP is based on open
   standards, which allows interoperability between different vendors
   and products, driving down the costs associated with implementing
   security solutions in OT networks.  Securing OT communication over
   packet-switched IP networks follows the same principles that are
   foundational for securing the IT infrastructure, i.e., consideration
   must be given to enforcing electronic access control for both person-
   to-machine and machine-to-machine communications, and providing the
   appropriate levels of data privacy, device and platform integrity,
   and threat detection and mitigation.
