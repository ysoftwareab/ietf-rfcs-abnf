               The interworking between IKEv2 and PMIPv6
            draft-zhu-netext-ikev2-interworking-pmip-00.txt

Abstract

   During the network operation, there is a scenario where the IKEv2 is
   used between MN and MAG while the PMIPv6 is used between MAG and LMA.
   Hence, the interworking between IKEv2 and PMIPv6 need to be
   considered in this scenario.

1.  Motivation

   Non-transparent access is supported in UMTS since Release 99 and in
   Rel-8 it was naturally extended to the EPS with 3GPP access.  In both
   UMTS and EPS, the credentials for PAP or CHAP authentication with the
   private Packet Data Network (PDN) are carried transparently between
   the UE and the GGSN/PGW inside the Protocol Configuration Options
   (PCO) information element.  In I-WLAN it is possible to access a
   private PDN via a Packet Data Gateway (PDG) as defined in 3GPP TS
   29.161.  The approach specified in 3GPP TS 29.161 relies on multiple
   IKEv2 authentication exchanges, based on rfc4739.

   However, access to private PDNs is still not possible via untrusted
   non-3GPP IP access, e.g.  WLAN access with PMIPv6-based interface.
   Since the ePDG (i.e.  MAG, contrary to the PDG in I-WLAN) has no
   RADIUS or Diameter interface with the AAA server in the private
   network, even according to rfc4739 the ePDG is not able to contact
   the AAA Server for the external authentication and authorization
   after receiving the credentials.

   This document attempts to figure out the issue described above via
   extending PMIPv6 to achieve external authentication and authorization
   between UE and the AAA server.

2.  Protocol Overview

   It is proposed to define a new mobility option as a container (IKEv2
   container) in Proxy Binding Update and Proxy Binding Acknowledge,
   which can be used to convey the information from IKEv2 and the result
   of external authentication and authorization.

   The following steps is performed during the external authentication
   and authorization as described in Figure 1.

                                  access

   The steps of the procedure in Figure 1 are as following.

   1.  The mobile node performs additional authentication and
   authorization with an external AAA Server as specified in rfc4739

   2.  The MAG contructs the IKEv2 container (e.g.  PCO) in the Proxy
   Binding Update, copies the information from IKEv2 (e.g.  User ID and
   password) into the IKEv2 container and sends the PBU to the LMA.

   3.  The LMA uses the authentication credentials provided in the IKEv2
   container to perform an additional authentication and authorisation
   with an external AAA server.

   4.  Upon receiving the access response from external AAA server the
   LMA copies the results from the response message to the IKEv2
   container which is included in the Proxy Binding Acknowledge.

   5.  Upon receiving credentials in the Proxy Binding Acknowledge the
   MAG performs the procedure as described in rfc4739 to complete the
   external Authentication/Authorization.
