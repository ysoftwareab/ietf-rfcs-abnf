Tag = 00 - Log SIP Header Field or Reason-Phrase

         When logging a SIP Header Field (Tag=00), the associated
         "Value" field MUST be populated by the entire header field
         being logged.  That is, the field-name, the associated colon
         (":") and the field-value.  This mechanism provides the
         capability to optionally log any SIP header field by
         identifying the field being logged within the "Value" field.

         Because the Reason-Phrase in a response is part of the Status-
         Line and is not identified with a field-name, it is a special
         case.  In this instance, the the associated "Value" field MUST
         be populated by the name "Reason-Phrase" followed by a colon
         (":") and a single space (SP) between the colon and the logged
         Reason-Phrase value.
         The corresponding "Length" field includes the length of the
         entire "Value" field.  This includes the field-name, the colon,
         and any LWS separator.  For Tag=00 the BEB is set according to
         whether the SIP Header Field value contains any 'unprintable'
         characters.  If it does not the BEB=00; if it does the BEB=01.
         If BEB=01 then only the field-value MUST be Base64 encoded; the
         field-name, the associated colon and any LWS separator MUST
         retain their original encoding.

         If an optional field occurs more than once in a SIP message
         (e.g.  Contact, Route, Record-Route, etc.) then each occurrence
         MUST be logged with the same Tag value (i.e., Tag=00) as a
         distinct optional field entry in the SIP CLF record.  These
         repeated optionally logged header fields MUST preserve the
         ordinal position of the repeated header fields in the SIP
         header.  For example, a SIP header containing two Via header
         fields with the following ordinal positions within the SIP
         header: V1,V2.  If optionally logging these header fields they
         would occur as the following entries in the SIP CLF record.
         (Note: For the sake of brevity this example only shows how
         these optional header fields would be logged and omits the
         remainder of the SIP CLF record):



         00@00000000,len_V1,00,Via: V1     00@00000000,len_V2,00,Via: V2

         The CRLF at the end of a given header field value MUST NOT be
         logged.  Thus, optional SIP header fields logged with Tag=00
         MUST NOT contain a CRLF when logged so no escaping mechanism is
         required for it.

Tag = 01 - Log message body

         SIP message bodies of all types can be optionally logged using
Tag=01.  If the message body is logged it MUST adhere to the
BEB=01 then it MUST be Base64 encoded prior to any character
Tag = 02 - Log entire SIP message

         The entire SIP message (i.e., SIP header and message body) can
         be optionally logged using a Tag=02.  Logging the entire SIP
         message MUST conform to the maximum size limitation of 4096
         bytes for a SIP CLF field, as detailed in Section 8 of
         [I-D.ietf-sipclf-problem-statement].  Unlike with Tag=00, there
         can only be a single entry in the SIP CLF record with Tag=02.
         When optionally logging the entire SIP message if the maximum
         SIP CLF field size of 4096 bytes is exceeded the entire SIP
         message being logged MUST be truncated to meet these size
         limitations.

         When optionally logging an entire SIP message (Tag=02) the BEB
         is set according to whether the message body portion contains
         any 'unprintable' characters.  If it does not the BEB=00; if it
         does the BEB=01.  If BEB=01 then the entire SIP message is
         Base64 encoded (not just the message body).  Note that unlike
         the case of Tag=01, when logging an entire SIP message (Tag=02)
         with 'unprintable' characters (BEB=01) the Content-Type would
         not be known prior to decode.
         All instances of CRLFs, whether they appear in the SIP headers
         or the SIP message body MUST be escaped by using the URI
         encoded equivalent value of "%0D%0A".  If a logged SIP message
         has BEB=01 then it MUST be Base64 encoded prior to any
         character escaping.
