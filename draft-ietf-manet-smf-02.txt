Abstract

   This document describes the Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF)
   protocol that provides a basic IP multicast forwarding capability
   within mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET).  SMF is designed to have
   limited applicability as a forwarding mechanism for multicast packets
   within MANET routing areas.  In addition, it provides mechanisms to
   support interoperability with a connected wired infrastructure.  SMF
   uses a simplified forwarding mechanism that delivers multicast

   packets to all MANET multicast receivers within a MANET routing area.
   The core design does not use receiver specific group information in
   favor of reduced complexity and state maintenance within the mobile
   topology.  Such extensions may follow in later specifications.  The
   design accounts for the unique nature and behavior of MANET
   interfaces and takes advantage of efficient relay set algorithms
   previously designed and applied in the MANET routing control plane.
   This document describes the SMF forwarding mechanisms in detail,
   specifies an optional SMF neighborhood discovery protocol, and
   describes several efficient relay set algorithms that have been
   implemented in conjunction with SMF.

2.  Introduction

   Design and implementation progress has been made in developing and
   implementing more efficient ways to flood control packets within
   MANET wireless routing protocol designs.  For example, algorithms
   within MANET RFC 3626 [RFC3626]and RFC 3684 [RFC3684] specify
   distributed methods of dynamically electing reduced relay sets for
   the purposes of optimizing the flooding routing control packets to
   all MANET nodes.  In this document, we specify the Simplified
   Multicast Forwarding (SMF) framework.  The main purpose of SMF is to
   adapt efficient flooding designs in MANET environments and apply
   these mechanisms to IP multicast packet forwarding.  When efficient
   flooding is a sufficient technique, SMF can make multicast forwarding
   available to data flows within a MANET routing area.  The SMF
   baseline design limits the scope to basic, best effort multicast
   forwarding and its applicability is intended to be constrained within
   a MANET routing area.  Figure 1 provides an overview of the logical
   SMF node architecture, consisting of "Neighborhood Discovery", "Relay
   Set Selection" and "Forwarding Process" components.  Typically, relay
   set selection (or even self-election) will occur based on input from
   a neighborhood discovery process, and the forwarding process will be
   controlled by status based upon relay set selection.  In some cases,
   the forwarding decision for a packet may also depend on previous hop
   or incoming interface information.  The asterisks (*) in Figure 1
   mark the primitives and relationships needed by relay set algorithms
   requiring previous-hop packet forwarding knowledge.

   This document describes a network layer multicast forwarding process
   compatible with different neighborhood discovery protocols and relay
   set selection algorithms.  Different discovery mechanisms or relay
   set algorithms may be applicable for different MANET routing
   protocols and deployments.  In the simplest case, Classical Flooding
   (CF) can be supported, eliminating the need for any relay set
   algorithm or neighborhood topology information.  However, it is
   expected that more efficient flooding techniques will be preferred
   due to expected gains in network efficiency and reductions in
   wireless congestion and contention.  Efficient flooding is realized
   by selecting a _subset_ of all possible nodes in a MANET area as the
   forwarding relay set.  Algorithms exist that can make use of local
   network neighborhood topology information to determine an appropriate
   relay set in a distributed, dynamic fashion.  These relay set
   selection algorithms can be used to provide a distribution tree for
   user multicast data[MDC04].  A few such relay set selection
   algorithms are described in Appendices of this document, but it is
   possible that additional relay set algorithms or extensions may be
   specified in the future for use with SMF.

   As noted, neighborhood topology information is usually needed for a
   relay set selection algorithm to determine an appropriate set of
   forwarding nodes.  In many cases, it is expected that neighborhood
   topology discovery functions may be provided by a MANET unicast
   routing protocol or HELLO protocol implementation running in
   concurrence with SMF.  Or, in other cases, it is possible that the
   lower link layer or multiple access protocols may provide the
   necessary neighborhood information through an enhanced interface.

   Different distributed relay set algorithms and associated forwarding
   decision logic often have differing neighborhood discovery and
   signaling demands.  This document states specific requirements for
   neighborhood discovery with respect to the forwarding process and
   relay set selection algorithms described herein and defines an
   optional SMF Neighborhood Discovery (ND) protocol that can support
   operation independent of any MANET unicast protocol.

   Note that Figure 1 provides a notional architecture for _typical_
   MANET SMF-capable nodes.  However, a goal is that simple end-system
   (non-forwarding) wireless nodes may also participate in multicast
   traffic transmission and reception with standard network layer
   semantics.  Also, a multicast border gateway mechanism MUST be used
   when interoperating with other IP multicast routing in the wired
   world (e.g., PIM).  In present experiments, proxying methods have
   been used to enable some gateway functionality at MANET border
   gateways operating with wired multicast routing protocol interfaces.
   Although SMF may be extended or combined with other protocols to
   provide increased reliability and group specific forwarding state,
   the details of those methods will be discussed in other documents.

2.2.  Applicability

   A basic packet forwarding service that reaches all destinations
   participating within a MANET environment can be a useful generic
   group communication mechanism for an application layer.  While the
   design requirements for this are similar to those often needed by the
   control plane of many MANET unicast routing protocol layers, it is
   desirable to provide a more generic forwarding function for use by
   other applications.  There are a number of application areas that
   could take advantage of a simple ALL_MANET_NODES delivery service
   within a MANET routing region (e.g., multimedia streaming, peer-to-
   peer middleware multicasting, auto-configuration, and multi-hop
   discovery services).

3.  SMF Design Considerations

   The simplest design often conceived and adapted for MANET packet
   flooding is something we designate as the "classical flooding" (CF)
   algorithm.  In CF, each participating forwarder node is required to
   rebroadcast packets intended for dissemination once and only once.
   This approach is extremely simple and only requires only some means
   of duplicate packet detection (DPD) and a basic forwarding mechanism.
   However, it is well known that using CF, especially within dense
   networks, results in a significant number of redundant transmissions
   often referred to as the broadcast storm problem [NTSC99].  Within
   wireless multi-hop network direct contention and interference is
   often experienced beyond the single hop interface and reducing
   unnecessary channel contention within a MANET can also significantly
   improve network performance.  Therefore, minimizing the number of
   required relay nodes is a heightened design goal in this environment.
   Unfortunately, reducing the number of relay nodes in a MANET
   environment may also decrease the robustness of packet delivery in a
   mobile topology.  There exists a design tradeoff between relay
   efficiency and delivery robustness that is scenario and system
   dependent and should be considered carefully.  If needed, additional
   reliability mechanisms MAY be considered for use with reduced relay
   sets (e.g., backup and redundant relay set) but the use of limited
   hop-by-hop retransmission schemes at the network layer are considered
   out of scope for this document.  If needed by an application, the use
   of IETF reliable multicast transport layer protocols (e.g., RMT)
   should be transparently supported by SMF's best effort delivery
   mechanism.  The basic design goal of SMF is support both a simple CF-
   based forwarding capability and to supplement this with reduced relay
   set algorithms for increased efficiency.

   At a theoretic level, work in the area of minimizing packet
   forwarders, or relay node sets, is often related to basic graph
   theory problems.  In graph theory, a dominating set (DS) for a graph
   is a set of vertices that, along with their neighbors, constitute all
   the vertices in the graph.  A connected DS (CDS) is a DS where the
   subgraph induced is connected.  A minimum CDS (MCDS) is a set such
   that the number of vertices is the minimum required to form a CDS.
   Finding a small dominating set is one of the most fundamental
   problems of traditional graph theory and is often related to the
   problem of optimizing flooding algorithms in MANET routing protocols.
   Finding an MCDS in a given graph is known to be NP-hard [GJ79].
   These basic static graph theoretic issues are important to apply in
   developing efficient relay sets, but in addition MANET relay set
   designs require distributed and dynamic operation.  To better explain
   the design requirement, we formulated the following characteristics
   desired of an effective MANET flooding algorithm solution for use in
   SMF:

   1.  A resultant cover set that is small compared to the total number
       of nodes as the network scales in size and density.

   2.  A robust approach somewhat resilient to network mobility and link
       dynamics.

   3.  A cover set election/maintenance mechanism that is lightweight,
       distributed, and adaptive in nature.

3.1.  Previous Related Work

   Previous novel work on MANET flooding and reduced relay set
   mechanisms has been done and this document borrows from and builds
   off previous work accomplished.  In [WC02], a taxonomy of flooding
   algorithms for use in MANET environments was presented and the work
   examined performance issues related to various approaches.  Other
   important work has developed distributed mechanisms that select and
   maintain reduced relay node sets.  As we have already mentioned, the
   design tradeoffs are further complicated by wireless contention,
   topological classes, and the robustness of packet delivery and set
   election under mobility scenarios.  In addition, the actual protocol
   implementation for IP multicast forwarding based upon these flooding
   algorithms raises additional design tradeoffs and issues.  This
   includes:

   1.  protocol state maintenance

   2.  duplicate packet detection mechanisms

   3.  packet processing requirements and overhead

   4.  expected traffic distribution patterns

   5.  protocol signaling requirements

   6.  delivery robustness requirements

4.  SMF Packet Processing and Forwarding

   The SMF Packet Processing and Forwarding actions are conducted with
   the following packet handling activities:

   1.  Interception of outbound, locally-generated multicast packets.

   2.  Reception of inbound packets on a specific network interface(s).

   In the case that sequence-based DPD as described in Section 5 is
   used, the purpose of intercepting outbound, locally-generated
   multicast packets is to apply resequencing of the IPv4 ID header
   field or add options headers as needed (e.g.  IPv6).  In the case
   that resequencing is deemed necessary, it is RECOMMENDED that
   sequence numbering be applied such that a different sequence number
   space per <sourceAddress::destinationAddress> duple be used.  For
   initial SMF purposes where no distinct routing path decisions for
   different IP Multicast address destinations occur, it might appear to
   be sufficient to use sequence number spaces aggregated across all IP
   Multicast destinations (or across all IP destinations for a source as
   is the default implementation of the IPv4 ID field in many operating
   systems).  Future SMF extensions, beyond the present discussion, may
   contain dynamic forwarding state dependent on the multicast
   destination address.  The future possibility that different
   destinations may be routed differently suggests "per source/
   destination" numbering be used.  It should be noted that the default
   global IPv4 ID sequence space may be sufficient for some SMF
   deployments and interception of outbound packets may not be required
   if end systems have numbered the IPv4 ID field in an acceptable
   manner.  In other cases, such as when IPSec headers have been applied
   to packets, other sequence information (perhaps even "per flow") may
   be available for the SMF process to make use of in its duplicate
   table management.

   Inbound multicast packets will be received by the SMF implementation
   and processed for possible forwarding.  Well-known multicast groups
   for flooding to all nodes of an ad hoc network are specified for use
   with the network-layer flooding provided by SMF.  These multicast
   groups are specified to contain all nodes of a contiguous ad hoc
   network, so that packets transmitted to the multicast address
   associated with the group will be delivered to all nodes as desired.
   In other words, any node that is reachable, is automatically granted
   membership in these multicast groups.  For IPv6, the multicast
   address is specified to be "site-local".  The names of the multicast
   groups are given as "ALL_IPv4_MANET_NODES" (TBD) and
   "ALL_IPv6_MANET_NODES" (TBD).  This document does not support
   transmissions to any directed broadcast address ranges.  Minimally
   SMF SHALL forward unique (non-duplicate) packets received for these



Macker, editor & SMF Design Team  Expires September 6, 2006    [Page 10]

Internet-Draft                SMF for MANET                   March 2006


   well-known group addresses when the TTL or hop count value in the IP
   header is greater than 1.  Optionally, SMF deployments may choose to
   forward packets for additional "global scope" multicast groups to
   support application needs or to distribute multicast packets that
   have ingressed the MANET area via border gateways.  Additional
   addresses will be specified by an a priori list or possible through a
   dynamic address management interface.  In all cases, the following
   rules SHALL be observed for SMF multicast forwarding:

   1.  Multicast packets with TTL <= 1 MUST NOT be forwarded*.

   2.  Link Local multicast packets MUST NOT be forwarded

   3.  Incoming multicast packets with an IP source address matching one
       of those of the local host interface(s) MUST NOT be forwarded.

   4.  Received packet frames with the MAC source address matching the
       local host interface(s) MUST NOT be forwarded.

   Note that rule #3 is important because in wireless networks, the
   local host may receive re-transmissions of its own packets when they
   are forwarded by neighboring nodes.  This rule avoids unnecessary
   retransmission of locally-generated packets even when other
   forwarding decision rules would apply.

   Once these criteria have been met, the implementation should
   reference a forwarding decision algorithm, possibly in concert with
   duplicate packet detection, to determine the next step in packet
   processing.  The forwarding decision may be implicit if the SMF
   implementation is configured to perform classical flooding (CF) of IP
   multicast packets.  Otherwise, the forwarding decision may be
   controlled by another process.  Neighborhood discovery protocols
   coupled with the source-based multi-point relay (S-MPR) or other CDS
   selection algorithms described below MAY be used to determine the
   local host's status with respect to forwarding.  For example, some
   algorithms may control forwarding based on a previous hop indentifier
   (e.g.  S-MPR forwarding), while others may designate the local host
   as a forwarder of all packets (or at least those generated by known
   neighbors) based on the neighborhood broadcast topology (e.g.
   Essential CDS (E-CDS)).

   DPD is the perhaps the most complex portion of the SMF forwarding
   process.  In general, detection of received duplicate packets is
   necessary to avoid forwarding the same packet multiple times.
   However, in some cases (e.g., S-MPR), duplicate detection of some
   non-forwarded packets is also needed to maintain efficient
   forwarding.  Details on different duplicate packet detection and
   forwarding rules for the S-MPR, and E-CDS algorithms are given in

   algorithms may also apply to other similar algorithms.

5.  SMF Duplicate Packet Detection

   One important design difference between routing for MANET interfaces
   and many wired network interfaces is that forwarding out the same
   physical interface a packet arrived upon is a normal operation.  This
   operation is often disallowed or discouraged in wired multicast
   routing designs to avoid possible looping.  Similarly, any Reverse
   Path Forwarding (RPF) logic also used needs to be softened when
   operating over a single MANET interface.  This MANET interface
   characteristic leads to DPD as a common requirement in MANET packet
   flooding.  While this requires increased per packet processing, it is
   necessary in MANET-specific multicasting because packets must be
   potentially be forwarded out the same physical interface they may
   arrive on and nodes can even receive copies of previously-transmitted
   packets from other forwarding neighbors.  This section describes a
   basic SMF DPD mechanism and some alternative operational options as
   considerations.

   SMF SHOULD implement explicit detection of duplicate multicast
   packets by a temporal packet identification scheme.  This is
   typically implemented by keeping a history of previous received and
   forwarded packet identifiers for comparison against recently
   forwarded multicast packets.  There are different possible approaches
   to packet identification that have been considered.  Possibilities
   include unique markings within packet header fields, such as packet
   sequence numbering, or application of hash algorithms or similar
   techniques to compactly and uniquely describe the history of recently
   received packets.  This document RECOMMENDS simple, sequence-based
   schemes that can be accomplished without additional (non-IP)
   encapsulation of packets and/or their content.  Encapsulation
   approaches are considered out-of-scope so that non-forwarding edge
   nodes within a MANET area may easily receive flooded content without
   any additional software beyond that of a typical IP stack.  Packet
   hashing approaches for DPD may be applicable in some cases, yet early
   examination of these approaches indicated the computation complexity
   may be prohibitive for per-packet processing on many candidate MANET
   platforms (e.g., PDAs).  Additionally, the unavoidable "cache-miss"
   rates, while possibly low for some algorithms, result in the severe
   penalty of false DPD (and thus packet loss) rather than the more
   benign penalty of additional computation cycles as associated with
   most applications of hashing.

   Implementations will need to age and/or timeout duplicate packet
   state as new packets are received and forwarded.  In the case that
   sequence-based packet identification is used, implementations SHOULD
   timeout stale histories for <sourceAddress::destinationAddress>
   entries where new, non-duplicate packets have not been recently
   received.  The proper duration of any timeout delay is a function of

   expected possible network traversal time, roughly NET_DIAMETER (in
   hops) times NODE_TRAVERSAL_TIME.  NET_DIAMETER measures the maximum
   possible number of hops given any two nodes in the network.
   NODE_TRAVERSAL_TIME is a conservative estimate of the average one hop
   traversal time for packets and should include queueing delays,
   interrupt processing times, medium access delays, and propagation
   delays.  If the timeout is reset only upon reception of non-duplicate
   packets, it also limits the time that packets might be incorrectly
   dropped if a source node is stopped and restarted in the case of
   sequence-based packet identification.  The required size of the
   duplication detection cache is similarly governed and is also a
   function of the maximum expected packet rate.

   Of course, the duplicate packet detection mechanism SHOULD avoid
   keeping unnecessary state for packet flows such as those that are
   locally generated or link local destinations that would not be
   considered for forwarding.

5.1.  SMF IPv4 Duplicate Packet Detection

   IPv4 multicast packets from a particular source are assumed to be
   marked with a temporally unique identification number in the ID field
   of the IPv4 packet header that can serve as a "packetIdentifier" for
   SMF purposes.  Unfortunately, in present operating system networking
   kernels, this IP header field value is not always generated or
   applied in a consistent manner with respect to SMF needs.  In order
   to build a working implementation without encapsulating packets, an
   SMF implementation SHOULD provide a sequence generation and marking
   module that can maintain and set a monotonically increasing IP ID
   field for locally-generated multicast packets with independent
   sequence number spaces applied on a <sourceAddress::
   destinationAddress> basis.  When needed this process will also
   recalculate and replace a proper IP header checksum for the
   formulated header.  For gateways injecting external IPv4 traffic into
   an SMF MANET area, the gateways SHOULD perform this same IP ID field
   re-sequencing.  Note the presence of IPSec may prevent such
   resequencing, but does provide its own organic means for duplicate
   packet detection.

   The use of IPSec for candidate packet flows presents the opportunity
   to make use of the additional, perhaps more reliable, sequencing
   information of the IPSec header for unique packet identification.
   The IPSec header provides a packet identifier field that can be used
   on a "per-security assocation" basis.  The IP addressing and IPSec
   Security Parameters Index (SPI) fields are used to identify security
   associations and, hence, packet flows.  So, if the packet is IPSec
   encapsulated, SMF will check the <sourceAddress::destinationAddress::
   SPI::packetIdentifier> where the <ESP_seq_number> or <AH_seq_number>



Macker, editor & SMF Design Team  Expires September 6, 2006    [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                SMF for MANET                   March 2006


   from the IPSec header serves as the "packetIdentifier" value.

   Although it would be possible to support IP layer fragmentation , SMF
   traffic sources or gateways SHOULD set the don't fragment bit for
   traffic intended to be carried by SMF.  This is recommended to avoid
   the additional complexity and inefficiencies arising from supporting
   IP layer fragmentation.

   To perform duplicate detection, SMF will check the <sourceAddress::
   destinationAddress::packetIdentifier> combination against a cache
   history of received packet identifiers.  Some forwarding algorithms
   may require that unique packets are only noted when received from
   certain neighbor nodes.  Multiple interface semantics may also add
   some additional considerations to the forwarding process depending
   upon the specific relay set selection forwarding rules.

   Although its use is demonstrated in working prototype code, the
   adoption of the IPv4 ID field for widespread packet duplication
   detection has some disadvantages that should be discussed.  The main
   disadvantage is that, as mentioned, the use and interpretation of the
   field is known to be non-consistent across operating systems.  The ID
   field is also limited and may provide less robust detection for high
   bandwidth applications since sequence wrap-around may occur
   relatively frequently if it is not possible to achieve "per source/
   destination" sequencing.  As an alternative, the use of a header
   option or encapsulation header in future implementations may provide
   more flexibility and consistency (see IPv6 DPD).  Another advantage
   of using a header option (or other encapsulation, if determined
   absolutely necessary) is that it would be possible for MANET gateway
   nodes to assess whether packets ingressing a MANET area have already
   been properly sequenced to avoid unnecessary re-injection of packets.
   We leave these design alternatives to be further defined and
   discussed in future work or later revisions of this ID.  A basic
   sequencing and marking design similar to the one we formulate here
   can be easily adapted to work with future approaches or can be
   bypassed when not needed.

5.2.  SMF IPv6 Duplicate Packet Detection

   The following section describes the mechanism and options for SMF
   IPv6 DPD.  The core IPv6 header does not provide an explicit
   identification header field that we can exploit for DPD.  SMF defines
   two methods for IPv6 use: a hop-by-hop DPD options header and the use
   of IPSec sequencing when an IPSec header is detected.  SMF MUST
   provide a DPD marking module that can insert the hop-by-hop IPv6
   header option defined for locally generated MANET multicast.  If the
   packet is _not_ IPSec encapsulated, SMF will use the IPv6 packet
   header and IPv6 DPD option to form <sourceAddress::



Macker, editor & SMF Design Team  Expires September 6, 2006    [Page 15]

   destinationAddress::packetIdentifier> that is checked against a cache
   history of received IPv6 packet identifiers.  Similarly to the case
   for IPv4, the presence of IPSec may prevent the intermediate addition
   of a hop-by-hop options header.  Fortunately, the IPSec header
   provides a packet identifier field that can be used on a "per-
   security assocation" basis.  The IP addressing fields and IPSec
   Security Parameters Index (SPI) fields are used to identify security
   associations and, hence, packet flows.  So, if the packet is IPSec
   encapsulated, SMF will check the <sourceAddress::destinationAddress::
   SPI::packetIdentifier> where the <ESP_seq_number> or <AH_seq_number>
   from the IPv6 IPSec header serves as a "packetIdentifier" value.

5.2.1.  IPv6 SMF-DPD Header Option Format

   Figure 2 illustrates the format of the IPv6 SMF Duplication Packet
   Detection (SMF-DPD) hop-by-hop header option.  (Discussion: Is there
   any value in specifying this as a "destination" option instead?).  If
   this is the only hop-by-hop option present, this will result in the
   addition of 8 bytes to the IPv6 packet header including the "Next
   Header", "Header Extension Length", SMF-DPD option fields, and
   padding.

6.  Relay Set Selection

   As mentioned SMF MUST support CF-based forwarding as a basic
   forwarding mechanism when optimized relay set information is not
   available or not selected.  In CF mode, each node transmits a locally
   generated or newly received packet exactly once.  The DPD technique
   mentioned in the previous section is critical to proper operation and
   avoids any duplicate packet retransmissions.

   In the requirements sections, it was stated that SMF MUST support the
   ability to modify forwarding rules based upon relay set information
   that is received dynamically during operation.  In this way, SMF can
   operate more efficiently within the MANET multicast area.  In the
   section we define the interface and processing semantics to allow SMF
   to support a variety of different relay set algorithms and
   approaches.

   Some recommended criteria for relay set selection algorithm
   candidates:

   1.  Robust with respect to mobility or other network dynamics

   2.  Require minimal signaling for neighbor discovery and/or control

   3.  Allow nodes to express preference for/against selection as relay

   Some relay set algorithms that meet this criteria are described in
   the Appendices of this document.  Different algorithms may be more
   suitable for different MANET routing types or deployments.
   Additional relay set selection algorithms may be specified in
   separate documents in the future.  The Appendices in this document
   can serve as a template for the content of such potential future
   specifications.

7.  Baseline SMF Neighborhood Discovery  Protocol (NDP)

   In absence of a compatible, coexisting unicast routing protocol or
   MAC layer protocol that provides neighborhood toplogy information
   sufficient for relay set selection, this section defines a basline
   SMF neighborhood discovery protocol (NDP) that MAY be run between SMF
   nodes.

   With respect to neighborhood topology knowledge and/or discovery,
   there are three basic modes of SMF operation:

   1.  Classical Flooding (CF) mode with no requirement for discovery or
       knowledge of neighborhood topology,

   2.  External control mode where an external process dynamically sets
       the local SMF relay status (e.g., Early SMF prototypes have
       leveraged neighborhood toplogy information collected by MANET
       unicast routing protocols such as OLSRv2 or Manet-OSPF ), and

   3.  Independent operating mode using a neighborhood discovery
       ("hello") protocol to collect the local topology information
       required for the various CDS algorithm modes discussed in the
       Appendices.

   We have previously discussed modes 1 and 2.  This section will
   specify a baseline, stand-alone NDP that can be used to operate SMF
   independent of any MANET unicast routing protocol and still provide
   optimized relay set functionality.  The intention of this protocol
   design is to be consistent with the Generalized MANET Packet/Message
   Format work [PacketBB] in progress within the MANET WG and the SMF
   protocol design is closely related to and borrows from the HELLO
   protocol being specified by OLSRv2 [OLSRv2] but separates out
   specific CDS algorithm support.

7.1.  SMF NDP Description

   SMF NDP messages are exchanged between local interface neighbor nodes
   and SMF NDP messages are transmitted to a well-known link-local
   multicast address, ALL_SMF_NEIGHBORS (TBD), on a well-known UDP port
   number , SMF_NDP_PORT (TBD).  The SMF NDP protocol provides the
   following functions:

   1.  1-hop neighbor link sensing: maintaining neighbor lists and
       performing a basic bidirectionality check of neighbor links

   2.  2-hop Neighborhood Discovery: collecting 2-hop symmetric
       neighborhood information and any information relevant to relay
       set election

   3.  Relay Set Signaling: signal relay set selection to neighbor nodes
       if the relay set algorithm requires such information

   SMF NDP messages are exchanged between link local neighbor nodes only
   and are not forwarded.

7.2.  SMF NDP Messaging

   SMF-NDP nodes periodically generate a single message type, SMF_HELLO,
   conforming to the Generalized MANET Packet/Message Format work
   [PacketBB] in progress within the MANET WG.  This generalized packet/
   message format provides a standard message header convention and a
   standard format for messages containing sets of type-length-value
   (TLV) content and blocks of network addresses with associated TLV
   content.  This supports the needs of SMF-NDP and typical MANET
   routing protocol messaging.

   _(TBD - Differential NDP messages may be defined in future revisions
   on this specification)_

   SMF NDP messages are generated and transmitted per interface, i.e.
   different SMF NDP messages are generated and transmitted per SMF
   interface of a node.  SMF NDP messages are generated and transmitted
   periodically, with a default interval between two SMF NDP messages of
   SMF_HELLO_INTERVAL.  The transmission of SMF_HELLO messages are also
   randomly jittered by a value establish by SMF_JITTER to decrease the
   likelihood of increased contention caused by synchronized SMF_HELLO
   intervals within a wireless network.  The default value for
   SMF_JITTER is 0.5, specified by valued between 0 and 1, and
   represents a percentage of SMF_HELLO_INTERVAL around which to jitter
   transmissions.

   The SMF_HELLO message contains a header, a set of message TLVs
   describing general properties of originating node (e.g., CDS
   algorithm id, SMF_HELLO transmission interval, relay "willingness",
   etc), and an address block of detected one-hop neighbors with an
   associated TLV block indicating the status and other attributes of
   connectivity to those neighbors.  Thus, by exchanging these messages
   with neighbors (via broadcast), SMF nodes gain knowledge of two-hop
   neighborhood connectivity.  This information can be used to execute
   the different relay set selection algorithms described in the
   Appendices of this document.  It is also possible that the SMF_HELLO
   message could be extended with additional address blocks and TLV sets
   as needed to support other relay set selection algorithms outside of
   the scope of this document.

7.2.1.  SMF_HELLO Message Header

   The SMF_HELLO message has a <message-header::type> value of SMF_HELLO
   (TBD).  The <msg-semantics> field SHALL have <bit 1> set to indicate
   a reduced <message-header-info> with _no_ <msg-ttl> or <hop-count>
   elements since the SMF_HELLO message is implicitly a one-hop message.
   Thus, the <msg-header-info> content shall consist of only the
   <originator-address> and<msg-seq-number> elements.  The <originator-
   address> SHALL correspond to the interface address on which the
   SMF_HELLO message was transmitted and the <msg-seq-number> will be
   incremented monotonically and receivers will use this field to track
   SMF_HELLO message loss.

7.2.2.  SMF_HELLO Message TLVs

   *Relay Set Algorithm Identifier*: type=SMF_RELAY_ALGORITHM, length    1, values = {CF, S-MPR, E-CDS, MPR-CDS}

   *Hello Transmission Interval*: type=SMF_HELLO_INTERVAL, length = 1,
   value = time*

   Note: The four highest bits of the 8-bit TLV value represent the
   mantissa (a) and the four lowest bits represent the exponent (b),
   yielding a time value equal to: time = (1+a/16)*2^b seconds.  Thus,
   values in the range from 62.5 msec to 32,768 seconds can be
   represented.

   *Relay "Willingness"*: type=SMF_RELAY_WILLING, length =1, value    "willingness"

   Note: If this message TLV is omitted, a default willingess value is
   assumed.  Also note that this particular TLV may be also be carried
   in the address block portion(s) of the message to convey
   "willingness" values learned from neighboring nodes.

7.2.3.  SMF_HELLO Address Block TLVs

   The first <address-block> of a SMF_HELLO message is comprised of a
   list of the message originator's neighbors.  The associated set of
   TLVs for the <address-block> describe the status and other attributes
   for the given list of neighbors.  In general, the TLVs will be
   "multivalue" TLVs that index the subset range of addresses to which
   they apply.  In some cases, a given TLV type may be provided for each
   address in the block, while in other cases, some TLVs may apply only
   to a subset of addresses.  Where possible, it is RECOMMENDED that
   implementations group address subsets within the <address-block>
   accordingly to preserve message compactness and minimize message
   processing demands.

   There are two TLV types that can be applied to convey the status of
   neighbors to the originating node.  At least one of these One of
   these "Link Status" is applied for neighbor nodes detected via the
   same interface on which the SMF_HELLO message is transmitted, while
   the other "Other Neighbor Status" conveys the status of neighbors on
   other interfaces.  For initial applications of SMF, it is expected
   that the "Link Neighbor Status" TLV will be most applicable and the
   "Other Neighbor Status" TLV will allow support when forwarding across
   an SMF domain comprised of multiple interfaces is required.

   *Link Neighbor Status*: type=SMF_LINK_STATUS, length=1, values    {HEARD, SYMMETRIC, LOST}

   *Other Neighbor Status*: type = SMF_OTHER_STATUS, length=1, value    {SYMMETRIC, LOST}

   The following table summarizes the use of these neighbor TLVs for
   different cases:

   +-------------------------------------------+-----------------------+
   | Set of neighbor addresses                 | TLV (type=value)      |
   +-------------------------------------------+-----------------------+
   | HEARD over the interface which the        | (Link Status=HEARD)   |

   | SYMMETRIC over the interface which the    | (Link                 |

   | LOST over the interface which the         | (Link Status=LOST)    |
   | SMF_HELLO was transmitted on              |                       |

   _(TBD - We plan to define an optional "link quality" <address-block>
   TLV (or a pair to convey quality))_

   Other <address-block> TLV types are required to support the relay set
   selection algorithms described in the Appendices of this document.
   For example, the S-MPR and MPR-CDS algorithms require a TLV type to
   indicate which address (if any) have been selected as MPRs for the
   originating node.  And the E-CDS algorithm requires a "Router
   Priority" value for each symmetric neighbor in the address list to
   enable its relay set selection mechanism.  Those TLVs are described

8.  SMF Multicast Border Gateway Considerations

   Typically, it is expected that SMF will be used to distribute
   multicast traffic within a MANET area.  However, it is also
   envisioned to allow interconnection of SMF operation with networks
   using other multicast routing protocols if appropriate conditions are
   met.  Some primary considerations for further defintion (TBD)
   include:

   1.  Determining which multicast groups should transit the gateway
       whether entering or exiting the attached MANET area(s).

   2.  TTL threshold or other scoping policies.

   3.  Any marking or labeling to enable DPD on ingressing packets.

   4.  Interface with exterior multicast routing protocols.

   5.  Possible operation with multiple gateways.

   The behavior of gateway nodes is the same as that of non-gateway
   nodes when forwarding packets to interfaces within the MANET area.
   Packets that are passed to interfaces operating typical multicast
   routing protocols SHOULD be evaluated for duplicate packet status
   since standard multicast forwarding for wired interfaces do not
   usually perform this function.

8.1.  Forwarded Multicast Groups

   Determining which groups should be forwarded to or from a MANET SMF
   area presents challenges.  Ideally, only groups for which there is
   active group membership should be injected into the SMF domain.  This
   might be accomplished by providing an IPv4 Internet Group Membership
   Protocol (IGMP) or IPV6 Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) proxy
   function so that MANET SMF nodes can inform attached gateways (and
   hence multicast networks) of their current group membership status.

8.2.  Multicast Group Scoping

   (TBD)

8.3.  Duplicate Packet Detection Marking

   Packets sourced external to an SMF area may not have duplicate packet
   sequencing properly applied and the gateway may need to provide that
   sequencing information upon entry to the network.  In the case of
   IPv6, the gateway can apply the SMF DPD Hop-by-Hop options header to
   packets forwarded into the MANET area for those packets that do not

   already have the option applied.  This header option provides the
   side benefit that the gateway can explicitly determine if the packet
   has already been marked and can use the packet identification field
   to determine that it is not re-injecting a duplicate packet.  For
   IPv4, it is RECOMMENDED that gateway nodes re-sequence the ID field
   of packets injected into the area.  However, the IPv4 ID field does
   not provide the gateway with explicit information on whether the
   field has been previously set for SMF purposes.  Thus, the potential
   exists that duplicate IPv4 packets may be re-injected by a gateway
   into an SMF area.  Further discussion and experimentation is
   recommended in this area.

   _(If multiple gateways are injecting packets, how do we make sure
   that dups are sequenced the same way? )_

8.4.  Interface with Exterior Multicast Routing Protocols

   (TBD)

8.5.  Multiple Gateways

   (TBD)

9.  Security Considerations

   Gratuitous use of option headers can cause problems in routers.
   Routers outside of MANET routing areas should ignore SMF header
   options if encountered.

   Authentication mechanisms to identify the source of an option header
   should be considered to reduce vulnerability to a variety of attacks.

10.  IANA Considerations

   There are number of discussions within this SMF specification that
   will be subject to IANA registration.  The IP Header Extensions being
   defined within this document MUST have an IANA registry established
   for them upon publication of the first RFC.  Additionally, the well-
   known multicast addresses intended for default use by the SMF
   forwarding process should be registered and defined by the first RFC
   published.  These IANA considerations may in common or may be handed
   in comjunction with other MANET protocol efforts including the
   General Message Format specification and potentially common
   neighborhood discovery protocol considerations.

11.  Acknowledgments

   Many of the concepts and mechanisms used and adopted by SMF resulted
   from many years of discussion of related work within the MANET WG.
   There are obviously many people that have contributed to past
   discussions and related draft documents within the WG that have
   influenced the development of SMF concepts that deserve
   acknowledgment.  In particular, the document is largely a direct
   product of the SMF design team within the IETF MANET WG and borrows
   text and implementation ideas from these individuals.

Appendix A.  Source-based Multipoint Relay (S-MPR)

   The source-based multipoint relay (S-MPR) set selection algorithm
   enables individual nodes, using two-hop topology information to
   select a minimum set of neighboring nodes that can provide relay to
   all nodes within a two-hop radius.  This distributed technique has
   been shown to approximate selection of a MCDS in [JLMV02].
   Individual nodes must collect two-hop neighborhood information from
   neighbors, determine an appropriate current relay set, and then
   inform the resultant selected neighbors of their relay status.  The
   Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol has used this algorithm
   and protocol for relay of link state updates and other control
   information[RFC3626] and has been shown to operate well even in
   dynamic network environments.

   Because a node's status as a relay is with respect to neighboring
   nodes who have selected it (i.e., its "selectors"), the relaying node
   must know the previous-hop transmitter of packets it receives in
   order to make an appropriate forwarding decision.  Additionally, it
   is important that relay nodes forward packets only for those nodes
   currently identified as symmetric, one-hop neighbors to maintain
   correctness.  Also, because the selection of relays does not result
   in a common set among neighboring nodes, relays MUST mark in their
   duplicate table any transmissions from non-selector, symmetric, one-
   hop neighbors (for a given interface) and not forward subsequent
   received copies of that packet even if received from a selector
   neighbor.  Deviation here may result in unecessary, even excessive,
   repeat transmission of packets throughout the network.  Or incorrect
   duplicate table recording of packets received from non-symmetric
   neighbors may result in incomplete flooding.  In these respects,
   flooding based on the S-MPR algorithm is more complex than that based
   upon some other relay set selection algorithms.

   When multiple interfaces are present, the S-MPR SMF forwarded must
   keep some independent state for each interface with regards to
   duplicate packets.  For example, when a packet is received from a
   non-selector, one-hop symmetric neighbor, an SMF forwarder using the
   S-MPR algorithm must update its duplicate packet state with respect
   to the interface on which the packet was received.  If the SMF
   forwarder receives that same packet from a selector neighbor on a
   different interface, it MUST still forward that packet on all
   interfaces it has not received that packet from a one-hop symmetric
   neighbor.  Once a packet has been forwarded in this fashion,
   subsequent duplicates received on any interface are ignored.

A.1.  S-MPR Relay Set Selection

   If SMF is operating S-MPR relay set election independent of

   coexistent OLSR operation, based upon SMF ND mechanisms, the election
   algorithm defined within RFC3626 [RFC3626] should be used.

A.2.  Neighborhood Discovery Requirements

   S-MPR election operation requires 2-hop neighbor knowledge as
   provided by the SMF NDP process or as available from external
   sources.  MPRs are dynamically selected by each node and selections
   MUST be advertised and dynamically updated within the SMF NDP or
   equivalent protocol.  For SMF NDP, the following <address-block> TLV
   is specified to indicate MPR selection status.

   *MPR Designation*: type=SMF_MPR_SELECT, length=0, value = [no value]

   Note this is a "no value" TLV, and the presence of this TLV implies
   that the corresponding address(es) have been selected by the
   SMF_HELLO message originator as MPR(s).

Appendix B.  Essential Connecting Dominating Set (E-CDS) Algorithm

   The "Essential connecting dominating set" (E-CDS) algorithm [E-CDS]
   allows nodes to use two-hop topology information to appropriately
   elect _themselves_ as relay nodes to form an efficient (for flooding)
   CDS.  While this algorithm does not tend to produce as small a set of
   relay nodes (per forwarded packet) as the previously-described S-MPR
   algorithm, it is not dependent upon previous-hop information to make
   a forwarding decision; it simply forwards any received non-duplicate
   packets.  This property also allows relay nodes using the E-CDS
   algorithm to be intermixed with nodes performing only classical
   flooding.  Additionally, the semantics for multiple interface support
   are simplified as compared to S-MPR and even packets that are
   received from non-symmetric neighbors may be forwarded without
   compromising flooding efficiency or correctness.

B.1.  E-CDS Relay Set Selection

   This section provides a short description of the E-CDS based relay
   set selection algorithm and is based upon Richard Ogier's original
   summary within [E-CDS].  This was originally discussed in the context
   of forming partial adjacencies and efficient flooding for MANET-OSPF
   work but its core algorithm is applied here.

   E-CDS requires two-hop neighbor information collected through the
   SMF-NDP or other process.  Each router has a Router Identifier (may
   be represented by an interface address) and Router Priority value.
   The Router Priority value may be dynamic and represent such metrics
   as node degree.  The fundamental election steps are as follows:

   1.  If an SMF node has a higher (Router Priority, Router ID) than all
       of its symmetric neighbors, it elects itself to the relay set.

   2.  Else, if there does not exist a path from neighbor j with largest
       (Router Priority, Router ID) to some other neighbor, via
       neighbors with larger values of (Router Priority, Router ID),
       then it elects itself to the relay set.

   The basic form of E-CDS described and applied within this
   specification does not at present define redundant relay set election
   but such capability is supported by the E-CDS design.

B.2.  E-CDS Forwarding Rules

   E-CDS forwarding are quite simple and straightforward.  As mentioned,
   there is no need to check previous hop information during forwarding.
   Upon electing itself as an E-CDS relay set forwarder, SMF nodes
   perform DPD functions and forward all ranges of multicast traffic

   allowed.

B.3.  Neighborhood Discovery Requirements

   To support functions required by the core E_CDS relay set algorithm
   the following TLV is required to be transmitted by each node within a
   SMF_HELLO message:

   *Router Priority*: type=SMF_ROUTER_PRIORITY, length=1, value    priority*

   For E-CDS operation, some value of SMF_ROUTER_PRIORITY must be given
   or assumed for each address in the <address-block> portion of the
   SMF_HELLO message.  If a SMF_HELLO message originator does not
   provide a SMF_ROUTER_PRIORITY value for given address(es), a default
   value SMF_RPRI_DEFAULT=(TBD) should be assumed.  Local determination
   of a node SMF_ROUTER_PRIORITY value can be done in multiple ways as
   described in the [E-CDS].  An early implementation of SMF and E-CDS
   has used node degree computed during neighbor discovery, yet it is
   still unclear if this is the best method.  Unlike the MPR method, the
   E-CDS is a self-electing algorithm.  SMF_ROUTER_PRIORITY needs to be
   shared with all immediate neighbor nodes and 2-hop neighbor knowledge
   is needed during the self election process.  Further algorithm
   examples and details are covered in the Appendices.

Appendix C.  Multipoint Relay Connected Dominating Set (MPR-CDS)
             Algorithm

   The MPR-CDS algorithm is an extension to the basic MPR election
   algorithm and results in a shared relay set that forms a CDS.  Its
   forwarding rules within SMF are non-dependent upon previous hop
   information similar to E-CDS.

C.1.  MPR-CDS Relay Set Selection

   An overview of the the MPR-CDS selection algorithm is provided in
   [MPR-CDS].  The basic requirements for election are similar to the
   basic MPR algorithm with the addtion that some node ordering
   knowledge is required.  This is similar to the E-CDS requirement and
   can be based upon node IP address or some other unique router
   identifier.  The rules for election are as follows:

      A node decides it is in the relay set if:

   1.  the node is smaller than all its neighbors (Rule 1)

   2.  or the node is an MPR of its smallest neighbor (Rule 2)

C.2.  MPR-CDS Forwarding Rules

   MPR-CDS forwarding are quite simple and straightforward.  As with
   E-CDS, there is no need to check previous hop information during
   forwarding.  Upon electing itself as a MPR-CDS relay set forwarder,
   SMF nodes perform DPD functions and forward all ranges of multicast
   traffic allowed.

C.3.  Neighborhood Discovery Requirements

   No additional discovery requirements are needed beyond the basic
   Hello and MPR-related TLVs already discussed.
