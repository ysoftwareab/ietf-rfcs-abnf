          Analysis on Forwarding Methods for Service Chaining
             draft-homma-sfc-forwarding-methods-analysis-00

Abstract

   Some working groups of the IETF and other Standards Developing
   Organizations are now discussing use cases of a technology that
   enables data packets to traverse appropriate service functions
   through networks.  This is called Service Chaining in this document.
   (Also, in Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV), a subject that
   forwarding packets to required service functions in appropriate order
   is called VNF Forwarding Graph.)  This draft does not focus only on
   SFC method, and thus, use the term "Service Chaining".  SFC may be
   one method to realize Service Chaining.  There are several Service
   Chaining methods to forward data packets to service functions, and
   the applicable methods will vary depending on the service/network
   requirements of individual networks.

   This document presents the results of analyzing packet forwarding
   methods and path decision patterns for achieving Service Chaining.
   For forwarding data packets to the appropriate service functions,
   distribution of route infromation and steering data packets following
   the route infromation, are required.  Examples of route information
   are packet identifier and the routing configurations based on the
   identifier.  Also, forwarding functions are required to decide the
   path according to the route information.

1.  Introduction

   Service Chaining is a technology that enables data packets to
   traverse the appropriate service functions deployed in a network.
   This draft assumes that Service Chaining is achieved in the following
   steps:

   a. A classification function identifies data packets and determines
      the set of services that will be provided for the packets and in
      which order.

   b. The path, that the packets will traverse for reaching the required
      service functions, is established based on the result of step a.

   c. Forwarding functions determine the appropriate destination and
      forward each packet to the next hop according to the path.

   d. A service function provides services to received packets and
      return each packet to the forwarding function.

   e. Steps c and d are repeated until each packet has been transferred
      to all required service functions.

   f. After a packet has been transferred to all required Service
      Functions, it is forwarded to its original destination.

   There are several forwarding methods for Service Chaining, and they
   can be classified into certain categories in terms of distribution of
   information for setting the paths and decision of the paths.  The
   methods used to distribute the information and the patterns used to
   decide the paths will affect the mechanism of Service Chaining as
   well as service flexibility.

   The applicable methods vary depending on network requirements, and
   thus, classifying and determining forwarding methods will be
   important in designing the architecture of Service Function Chaining
   (SFC).  This document provides the results of analyzing forwarding
   methods for Service Chaining.

   OAM, security, and redundancy are outside the scope of this draft.

2.  Definition of Terms

   Term "Classification", "Classifier" referred to draft-merged-sfc-
   architecture-01.  Term "Service Function", "Service Node" referred to
   draft-ietf-sfc-dc-use-cases-01.

   Service Chaining:  A technology that lets data packets traverse a
      series of service functions.

   Classification:  Locally instantiated policy and customer/network/
      service profile matching of traffic flows for identification of
      appropriate outbound forwarding actions.

   Classifier (CF):  The entity that performs classification.

   Service Function (SF):  A function that is responsible for specific
      treatment of received packets.  A Service Function can act at
      various layers of a protocol stack (e.g. at the network layer or
      other OSI layers).  A Service Function can be a virtual element or
      be embedded in a physical network element.  One of multiple
      Service Functions can be embedded in the same network element.
      Multiple occurrences of the Service Function can be enabled in the
      same administrative domain.

      One or more Service Functions can be involved in the delivery of
      added-value services.  A non-exhaustive list of Service Functions
      includes: firewalls.  WAN and application acceleration, Deep
      Packet Inspection (DPI), LI (Lawful Intercept) module, server load
      balancers, NAT44 [RFC3022], NAT64 [RFC6146].  NPTv6 [RFC6296],
      HOST_ID injection, HTTP Header Enrichment functions, TCP
      optimizer, etc.

   Service Node (SN):  A virtual or physical device that hosts one or
      more service functions, which can be accessed via the network
      location associated with it.

   Forwarder (FWD):  The entity, responsible for forwarding data packets
      along the service path, which includes delivery of traffic to the
      connected service functions.  FWD handles Forwarding Tables, which
      is used for forwarding packets.

   Control Entity (CE):  The entity responsible for managing service
      topology and indicating forwarding configurations to Forwarders.

   Service Chain (SC):  A service chain defines an ordered list of
      service functions that must be applied to user packets selected as
      a result of classification.  The implied order may not be a linear

      progression as the architecture allows for nodes that copy to more
      than one branch.

   Service Path (SP):  The instantiation of a service chain in the
      network.  Packets follow a service function path through the
      requisite service functions.  SP shows a specific path of
      taraversing SF instance.  For example, SC is written as SF#1 ->
      SF#2 -> SF#3 (This shows an ordered list of SFs), and SP is
      written as SF#1_1(1_1 means instance 1 of SF1) -> SF#2_1 ->
      SF#3_1.

   Service Chaining Domain (SC Domain):  The domain managed by one or a
      set of CEs.

   Service Path Information (SPI):  The information used to forward
      packets to The appropriate SFs based on the selected service.
      Examples of SPI include routing configurations for Forwarders,
      transport headers for forwarding packets to required SFs, and
      service/flow identifiable tags.

3.  Classification of Forwarding Methods and SP Decision Patterns

3.1.  Forwarding Methods

   In Service Chaining, data packets are transferred to service
   functions, which can be located outside the regular computed path to
   the original destination.  Therefore, a routing mechanism that is
   different from general L2/L3 switching/routing may be required.  The
   routing mechanism can be classified into three methods in terms of
   distribution of SPI and packet forwarding.

3.1.1.  Method 1: Forwarding Based on Flow Identifiable Information

   The mechanism of method 1 is shown in Figure 1.  In this method,
   routing configurations based on flow identifiable information, such
   as 5-tuple (e.g. dst IP, src IP, dst port, src port, tcp) are
   indicated to the CF and each FWD.  There may be an CE to handle this.
   The flow identifiable information can be constructed with some fields
   of L2 or L3 or combination of those.  The information can be
   configured either before packets arrive, or at the time packets
   arrive at CF and FWD.  Each FWD identifies the packets with flow
   identifable information and forwards the packets to the SFs according
   to the configuration.  This method does not require changing any
   fields of the original packet frame.

   headers, onto the packets based on the classification.  The
   configuration about how FWDs handle the headers is pre-configured.
   Each FWD forwards the packets to SFs following the outermost header.
   The outermost header is removed after each forwarding or service
   process.  The actions are repeated until all headers are removed.

   configuration based on the tags is sent to each FWD (from some CE) in
   advance.  Each FWD fowards packets to the SFs following the
   configuration and the tag.  After a packet has traversed all SFs, the

3.2.  Service Path Decision Patterns

   Since Service Chain contains only logical information (e.g. series of
   services that are applied to flows and their sequences), the actual
   instances, which are called Service Paths, are needed in order for
   the forwarding process to work.  In this process, an instance of
   Service Path is created at certain points during a packet's delivery.
   Therefore, to forward packets, the Service Chain needs to be turned
   into an SP, which indicates specific FWDs (or switches, routers) and
   SFs that the packets will be forwarded to.  In the Service Chain to
   SP change points, the paths that determine the Service Chaining are
   classified into two patterns.

3.2.1.  Pattern 1: End to End Static Service Path

   The translation point is only a CF; that is, the SP is statically
   pre-established as an end-to-end path.  A CF inserts packets into the
   appropriate pre-established path based on their classification.  Each
   FWD on the route has a routing table to uniquely determine the next
   destination of packets, and each FWD statically forwards the received
   packets to the next destination.  FWDs require only a function to
   receive indications of routing configurations from the CE.  Pattern 1
   can be achieved in the following ways.

3.2.1.1.  SF Shared Model

   Figure 4 shows the mechanism of this way.  An SF is shared by
   multiple SPs.  In this way, the FWDs require a function to identify
   packets and insert the packets into the next appropriate hop.

   SP.  At each FWD, incoming packets are statically routed to a single

   points are a CF and FWDs.  The SP is established by a series of
   multiple paths, which are sectioned by CFs and FWDs.  Each path
   determined by CFs and FWDs is referred to as a segmented path in this
   draft.  CFs or FWDs that determine the next segmented path may
   require notification of routing configurations from the CE.
   Moreover, some FWDs require functions to select the destination of
   packets from various alternatives and to retrieve the information for
   selecting the next path.  For example, each FWD obtains metric

   information or load conditions of servers and selects an optimal
   segmented path based on that information.  The CE may have the
   selection mechanism and may notify CSs/FWDs of it.

4.  Consideration of Service Chaining Methods and Architecture Patterns

   This chapter presents the results of analyzing the forwarding methods
   and architecture patterns in chapter 3.





Homma, et al.            Expires April 30, 2015                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft draft-homma-sfc-forwarding-methods-analysis  October 2014


4.1.  Analysis of 3.1.  Forwarding Methods

4.1.1.  Analysis of Method 1

   This method can achieve Service Chaining without adding any headers
   to packets, so it may not cause any increase in packet size or be
   subject to MTU restrictions.  Furthermore, this method does not
   require additional functions within SFs to be applied to any headers
   because data packets are transported in original format.  Therefore,
   it will be easier to use legacy SFs for network operators.

   However, forwarding entries or static configuration for a flow at
   each FWD is required.  For example, if there are 10,000 flows to be
   handled at a CF/FWD, the routing table for each CF/FWD uses 10,000
   flow entries at most.  Therefore, it might not be feasible for large-
   scale networks such as carrier networks that handle a Service Chain
   per user (which means that individual users have their own policies),
   because some large carriers have over a million users and even more
   flows.  Another concern is the traffic increase in the control plane
   because route setting is required for each flow.  Moreover, it may be
   hard to use this method if some service functions modify header
   fields of a packet or frame, for example, NAT/NAPT, in a chain.  For
   example, if a NAT changes the IP address of packets dynamically, the
   FWDs that follow need to renew their routing tables.  The results of
   the above analysis suggest that this method may be suitable for
   networks with a limited number of flows.

4.1.2.  Analysis of Method 2

   In this method, none of the FWDs require any specific routing tables
   for Service Chaining, but they require a function to forward packets
   based on header information, and to remove the outermost header from
   the received packets.  Therefore, the control plane would be simple
   because the SC controller would not be required to manage the routing
   configuration of FWDs.  Also, there are already several technologies
   proposed that can be used to achieve this method, such as MPLS.

   However, the more the SFs packets traverse, the more headers have to
   be added to the packet and this in turn means that the packet size
   increases.  But packet sizes are restricted by the minimal available
   MTU of any link in the network path and exceeding the MTU will
   require to fragement the original packet before starting to add more
   headers required to the service chaining.  This requires more
   complexity in processing due to the fragementation, adds a new source
   of errors, as fragments of packets can get lost and so the whole
   original packet will get discared, and also will cause an increase in
   traffic as more packets have to be processed by the network.
   Moreover, from a hardware point of view, it might be challenging for



Homma, et al.            Expires April 30, 2015                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft draft-homma-sfc-forwarding-methods-analysis  October 2014


   FWDs or SFs to process packets with variable length headers.  In
   terms of SF equipments, if fragmented packets need to be reassembled
   at every SF, this would be very wasteful of CPU resources, and some
   equipment has restricted resources and memory for reassembly.  The
   results of the above analysis indicate that this method would be
   appropriate when the number of SFs in an SC is small, or most packets
   are forwarded to a static SP.  On the other hand, it may be
   unsuitable in cases where there are many SFs in a chain.

4.1.3.  Analysis of Method 3

   In this method, a tag is defined for each Service Chain.  By adopting
   single fixed-length tags, this method can prevent an increase in the
   amount of traffic in the data plane, and can provide an upper bound
   on packet size.  (Problems which happen as a result of exceeding MTU
   are stated in 4.1.2.)  This method also enables FWDs to save
   resources when handling flow entries.  Therefore, this method has
   many advantages in terms of scalability, and it might be appropriate
   for use in large-scale networks.

   However, this method might require renewal of equipments, or
   Operating Systems (OSes) installed in hardware, or softwares, or any
   other components to realize the method in network which includes SFs,
   if this tag handling is an entirely new mechanism.  Furthermore
   discussion might be required to deploy such standardized
   technologies.

4.2.  Analysis of 3.2.  Determination of Service Paths

4.2.1.  Analysis of Pattern 1

   In this pattern, the mechanism of FWDs would be simpler than the one
   in pattern 2 because FWDs do not require any functions to select
   paths or retrieve any information for determination of the next hop.
   Moreover, it is not necessary to maintain the state of each flow.

   However, this pattern will impact the flexibility of the SCs, as
   adding new SFs to a SC, removing SFs from a SC, or migrating SFs to
   other locations requires an update or new creation of a path in the
   Service Path.  Furthermore, unified management of FWDs and SFs in an
   SC domain would be required in setting end-to-end paths.  Therefore,
   the management system of SPs, for example, a CE, for wide-area
   networks that include several segments may be massive and complex.
   Figure 7 shows the case in which SPs are established across multiple
   datacenters in pattern 1.  In Figure 7, a CE manages multiple
   datacenters as a single SC domain for establishing SPs across
   multiple datacenters.

Internet-Draft draft-homma-sfc-forwarding-methods-analysis  October 2014


   In pattern 4.2.1.2 (SF Dedicated Model), the number of flow entries
   that FWDs hold can be extremely small, as FWDs hold only static next-
   hop information.  Also, the CF function would be simple, as the CF
   only determines the gateway of each SP.  However, because the SF
   (instance) is settled for each SP, resource usage would be high if
   there were many SPs.

4.2.2.  Analysis of Pattern 2

   In this pattern, SPs are established with a combination of segmented
   paths, so it enables SPs to be established flexibly (which means, CEs
   do not need to constantly manage the entire end-to-end SP) based on
   additional information such as the load condition of SFs.

   Furthermore, in cases where some SPs traverse multiple datacenters
   across a WAN, SPs could be established with a combination of
   segmented paths that each datacenter determines independently based
   on the Service Chain information.  Therefore, it might be possible to
   separate SC domains into several small areas for WANs, which would
   enable a simpler configuration of each CE.  Figures 8 shows the case
   in which SPs are established across multiple datacenters in pattern
   2.  In Figure 8, each CE manages a single datacenter independently,
   and the CEs synchronize the Service Chain information for
   establishing and determining the appropriate segmented SPs in each
   domain.

   However, the (fault) monitoring of the whole SC can get harder as
   multiple domains are part of the SC.  On the other hand each domain
   can perfom its fault management as required (and probably better as
   it is more specific).  This will require an overarching (fault)
   monitoring where information from multiple SC domains is collected
   and aggregated to get a full view of the end-to-end service of the
   SC.

   Moreover, in this pattern, some FWDs may require additional
   mechanisms to select the next segmented path, and the FWDs must
   maintain the states of each flow because some SFs require a stateful
   process, and the FWDs need to insert packets into the same SF
   instances in the same session.

4.3.  Example of selecting Methods and Patterns

   In this section, clarifications about the most suitable method and
   pattern are made for the following example networks based on the
   results of the above analysis.

Internet-Draft draft-homma-sfc-forwarding-methods-analysis  October 2014


4.3.1.  Example A: Datacenter Network

   The conditions of network A are as follows:

   1. The network is used for several business offices as a single DC.

   2. Service Chain varies per office (not per user).

   3. The number of SF included in for each Service Chain is few. (e.g.
      within 5.)

   4. SF (instance) cost is not so high.

   5. MTU should not be restricted.

   6. Service Chains do not fork paths through end-to-end.  (As
      monitoring, or controlling will be harder, some operators may not
      want to change paths after packets got into a service chain.)

   On the basis of conditions 4 and 6, Pattern 1 (SF Dedicated Model)
   would be selected.  In this case, any method would be applicable.
   (Even if method 2 is selected, only one header that shows the gateway
   to the specific SC is stacked on packets.  This does not restrict the
   MTU.)

4.3.2.  Example B: Current Mobile Carrier Network

   The conditions of network B are as follows:

   1. The network handles millions of users.

   2. Service Chain (SF set and order) is predefined and limited.

   3. The number of SF, included in for each Service Chain, is few.
      (e.g. within 5.)

   4. The user chooses or the provider can choose for the user a
      predefined Service Chain to adopt to their traffic.

   5. SFs are located in (S)Gi-LAN.(Term referred to draft-ietf-sfc-use-
      case-mobility-01)

   6. Service Chains do not require to fork paths through end-to-end.

   On the basis of conditions 1, 2, and 5, Pattern 1 (SF Shared Model)
   would be selected because the architecture would be simple.

Internet-Draft draft-homma-sfc-forwarding-methods-analysis  October 2014


   On the basis of conditions 3 and 4, method 1 (unless the
   configuration or forwarding table does not increase explosively) or 3
   would be applicable.

4.3.3.  Example C: Fixed Mobile Convergence Network

   Conditions of the network A is as follows:

   1. The network handles millions of users.

   2. The user chooses or the provider can choose for the user multiple
      SFs to adopt to their traffic.

   3. Many SFs (e.g. 5 or more,) are included in for each Service Chain.

   4. SFs are located in multiple DCs.(e.g.  Some delay sensitive SFs,
      or SFs which should be placed near users' locations are installed
      in DCs located locally, and added-value SFs are installed in DCs
      located centrally.)

   5. There are some expansive SFs (instance) that should be shared by
      several SPs.

   6. Service Chains may be forked according to the process of SF.

   On the basis of conditions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, Method 3 would be
   applicable in terms of scalability.  Pattern 2 should be selected
   based on conditions 1 and 6.  Although the operation would be
   complex, there may be a case in which some carriers set multiple DCs
   and separate SC domains according to their network or service policy.
   The use case and architecture pattern is introduced in draft-ietf-
   sfc-dc-use-cases-01.
