1.  Introduction

   This Internet Draft documents the extensions to RSVP-TE that were
   used in the tests of GMPLS Controlled Ethernet (GELS), which were
   performed in the Acreo National Broadband Testbed end of 2006 and
   early 2007.

   In Section 2 we give a short background of the research in the test
   bed in general and the GMPLS controlled Ethernet in particular.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

2.  GMPLS Controlled Ethernet research

2.1.  The Acreo National Broadband Testbed

   The Acreo National Broadband Testbed (ANBT) has been set up a joint
   effort by the Swedish government and the Swedish industry.  Acreo AB
   was chosen to host the test bed, and the task is to initiate research
   projects on different aspects of broadband networks.  Methods for
   control of carrier Ethernet has attracted quite a bit of interest.

   GELS test bed is subset of the ABNT and consists of a 6 GMPLS enabled
   IP routers and 4 Ethernet Bridges.  In some of our tests we've also
   used Linux based SW Ethernet Bridges.

2.2.  Ethernet Control Plane

   The control plane as implemented in the ANBT consists of three
   different parts:

   o  Routing Protocol - OSPF-TE, we are running the OSPF-TE exactly as
      implemented by the Dragon project.

   o  Signaling protocol - RSVP-TE, we have made the extensions to
      RSVP-TE, RFC3471 [RFC3471] and RFC3473 [RFC3473] as specified in
      Section 3.

   o  Link Management Protocol - LMP, we have not yet implemented the
      LMP protocol.

2.3.  The Ethernet data plane

   In the test bed we have used Ethernet as specified in in IEEE Std
   802.1Q. This has been possible since we control the entire network by
   a GMPLS control plane and by default set up loop free LSPs.  We have
   no traffic that results in that flooding or learning is triggered
   entering the network.  This is clearly an artificial condition, but
   it is very well acceptable in a research network.

   To take GELS into production networks is outside the scope of the
   current work we've undertaken, our focus is to establish a test bed
   e.g. for tests of new control plane extensions, traffic engineering
   paradigms and advanced applications.  To run a GMPLS control plane
   for a production network will quite possibly require 802.1Q S-VLAN
   tags as specified in the IEEE Std 802.1ad Provider Bridging amendment
   to IEEE Std 802.1Q. and possibly the future IEEE802.1ah standard.

2.4.  Motivation for a GMPLS controlled Ethernet

   The answer to question "Why GELS?" is simple from a research
   perspective.  Very much of research starts from the question "What
   happens if ...?"

   In this case the question was "What happens if we make use of an
   GMPLS control plane to control an Ethernet network?"  The answere to
   that question will decide whether we'll continue using GELS a as
   configuration tool while setting up tests in our network.  Two
   tentative results today is that (1) for the application we have it is
   working well and saves us time, and (2) that we will look into the
   possibility to control every dynamic or configurable technology by
   the GMPLS control plane.

   In addition to this we also have a number of external parties
   interested in GELS.

   We have not been the only party active in this area, we have had a
   number of communications with e.g.  Dave Allan, Don Fedyk, Dimitri
   Papadimitriou, Adrian Farrel, Attila Takacs, Deborah Brungard, Jai
   Hyung Cho and Nurit Sprecher.  They have not reviewed this document,
   but nevertheless have had influence on our thinking on the subject.
   This is the major reason to share what we've been doing.

   We are also in debt to the Dragon project, that gave us a good start
   when we could use their open source code asa a starting point.

2.5.  Incremental development

   Our general approach to GELS has been stable over time, we've wanted
   to use the possibility to statically configure Ethernet Bridges by
   means of a GMPLS signalling protocol and to learn network topology
   and traffic engineering information by means of OSPF-TE.

   One thing has been changing though; our understanding what the
   "Ethernet label" is and how it can be used.

   o  Our first approach was that it would be possible to define a new
      Tag Protocol Identifier (tpid) that should have pointed to
      "Ethernet Label" rather than a 802.1Q VLAN tag.  Since this idea
      involved major changes to the Ethernet data plane, the Ethernet
      Standards and existing implementations this idea were quickly
      dropped.  However we were able to prove that the concept works on
      off the shelf equipment.

   o  Our second approach was to simply use the 802.1Q VLAN tag, but due
      to scalability problems (4096 labels per network) we wanted to

      swap them per link.  The IEEE802.1 have made it very clear this
      also breaks existing IEEE standards.  However, communications from
      IEEE802.1 have opened up for a certain type of VID swapping.
      There are indication that the idea of VID swapping, which is
      accepted at certain types of interface, might be increasingly
      accepted in the future.

   o  At this point a number of ideas started to emerge from a lot of
      different sources.  Today we are convinced that an Ethernet tag
      should be possible to use as an Ethernet label, often in
      combination with the destination MAC Address.  Further we are
      mostly looking to 802.1Q S-VLAN tags as defined in IEEE Std
      802.1ad Provider Bridging amendment to IEEE Std 802.1Q. It is
      possible that when the IEEE Std 802.1ah is ready the new tag
      defined there will be possible to use.

   o  Our current network works with standard 802.1Q bridges.

3.  Protocol extensions

   Taking a starting point in RFC3471 [RFC3471] and RFC3473 [RFC3473] we
   have made the following extensions and adaptations to RSVP-TE.

3.1.  Information in the Generalized Label Request Object

   The required information to be carried by a PATH message in the Label
   Request Object is defined in RFC3471, and the format of the Label
   Request Object is defined in RFC3473 as follows:


       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |            Length             | Class-Num (19)|  C-Type (4)   |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | LSP Enc. Type |Switching Type |             G-PID             |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   For the purpose of GELS we use the following encoding of the Label
   Request Object:


       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |            Length             | Class-Num (19)|  C-Type (4)   |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | Ethernet (2)  |   L2SC(51)    |           G-PID (33)          |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   This is according to the parameter definitions in RFC3471.

3.2.  Label Definition

   The format of a Generalized Label object is:


       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |            Length             | Class-Num (16)|   C-Type (2)  |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                             Label                             |
      |                              ...                              |

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   We have defined the Ethernet Label object as follows:


       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |            Length             | Class-Num (16)|   C-Type (2)  |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |    VID  (12)          |         DA MAC ADDRESS (20/48)        |
      |-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |   DA MAC ADDRESS (28/48)                              |T|M|L|R|
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+



      T = type bit, 1 indicates that both VID and DA MAC address is
      used, 0 indicates that only VID is used.

      M = merge bit, 1 indicates that merging is allowed, 0 indicates
      that merging is not allowed.

      L = learning bit, if the learning bit is set to 1 this indicates
      that GELS control plane is used to set up a standard IEEE802.1
      VLAN, i.e. learning, ageing, broadcast and a Spanning Tree
      Protocol (STP) will be turned on.

      R = reserved, set to 0 when sending, ignored when received.

3.3.  Suggested Label

   The suggested label object is optional and carried in the PATH
   message.  The format of the suggest is identical to the format of the
   Generalized Label object.

   The information and flags in the Suggested Label is interpreted as
   follows:

      If the ingress node specifies a VID in the suggested label this is
      the VID to be used.  If the VID field is set to all zeroes, this
      is an indication that no VID is specified.

      The DA MAC Address field should always be set to 0 by the ingress
      LSR in a Suggested Label object, and the field SHALL always be
      ignored when received.

      T = type bit, is set to 1 to indicate that both VID and DA MAC
      address should be used as the label.  If the bit it set to 0 this
      indicates that only the VID should be used as label.

      M = merge bit, is set to 0 to indicate that merging is not
      allowed, and to 1 to indicate that it is allowed.

      L = learning bit, is set to 1 to indicate that the GELS control
      plane is used to set up a standard IEEE802.1 VLAN.  The learning
      bit is set to 0 to indicate that an Ethernet LSP is requested.

      R = reserved bit, is always set to 0 when sending, and always
      ignored when receiving.

4.  Procedures

   When sending a PATH message the ingress LSR need to include a
   Suggested Label object.  The information in the Suggested Label
   object will be used by the egress node to determine the type of
   service requested.

   If the ingress LSR does not include a Suggested Label object in the
   PATH message, the egress LSR or merge LSR will treat it as if it were
   a request for an merge capable LSP with a label consisting of both a
   VID and a DA MAC address.

   When an intermediate LSR receives a PATH message with a Suggested
   Label object it MUST forward the Suggested Label object unchanged,
   unless it is able to merge on to an existing LSP.  The criteria for
   merging is for further study.

   An egress LSR that receives a path message carrying a Label Request
   object but no Suggested Label object WILL interpret this a a request
   for a merge capable LSP where both the VID and DA MAC Address is used
   a the label.

   Note: This section may be extended.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document specify protocol extensions to RSVP-TE that is intended
   to be used in research contexts.  Security consideration has
   therefore been left for further study and it is strongly recommended
   not to use these extensions in any network that is part of or
   connected to the Internet.
