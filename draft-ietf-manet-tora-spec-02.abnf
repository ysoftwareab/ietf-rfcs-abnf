NULL=(-,-,-,-,id)  An unknown or undefined height. Conceptually,
                      this can be thought of as an infinite height.

ZERO=(0,0,0,0,id)  The assumed height of a given destination. Note
                      that here "id" is the unique id of the given
                      destination.
