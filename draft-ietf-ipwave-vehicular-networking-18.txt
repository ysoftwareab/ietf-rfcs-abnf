               draft-ietf-ipwave-vehicular-networking-18

Abstract

   This document discusses the problem statement and use cases of
   IPv6-based vehicular networking for Intelligent Transportation
   Systems (ITS).  The main scenarios of vehicular communications are
   vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and
   vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications.  First, this document
   explains use cases using V2V, V2I, and V2X networking.  Next, for
   IPv6-based vehicular networks, it makes a gap analysis of current
   IPv6 protocols (e.g., IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, Mobility Management,
   and Security & Privacy), and then lists up requirements for the
   extensions of those IPv6 protocols for IPv6-based vehicular
   networking.

1.  Introduction

   Vehicular networking studies have mainly focused on improving safety
   and efficiency, and also enabling entertainment in vehicular
   networks.  The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the US
   allocated wireless channels for Dedicated Short-Range Communications
   (DSRC) [DSRC] in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) with
   the frequency band of 5.850 - 5.925 GHz (i.e., 5.9 GHz band).  DSRC-
   based wireless communications can support vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V),
   vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-everything (V2X)
   networking.  The European Union (EU) allocated radio spectrum for
   safety-related and non-safety-related applications of ITS with the
   frequency band of 5.875 - 5.905 GHz, as part of the Commission
   Decision 2008/671/EC [EU-2008-671-EC].

Internet-Draft          IPWAVE Problem Statement               July 2020


   For direct inter-vehicular wireless connectivity, IEEE has amended
   standard 802.11 (commonly known as Wi-Fi) to enable safe driving
   services based on DSRC for the Wireless Access in Vehicular
   Environments (WAVE) system.  The Physical Layer (L1) and Data Link
   Layer (L2) issues are addressed in IEEE 802.11p [IEEE-802.11p] for
   the PHY and MAC of the DSRC, while IEEE 1609.2 [WAVE-1609.2] covers
   security aspects, IEEE 1609.3 [WAVE-1609.3] defines related services
   at network and transport layers, and IEEE 1609.4 [WAVE-1609.4]
   specifies the multi-channel operation.  IEEE 802.11p was first a
   separate amendment, but was later rolled into the base 802.11
   standard (IEEE 802.11-2012) as IEEE 802.11 Outside the Context of a
   Basic Service Set (OCB) in 2012 [IEEE-802.11-OCB].

   3GPP has standardized Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X)
   communications to support V2X in LTE mobile networks (called LTE V2X)
   and V2X in 5G mobile networks (called 5G V2X) [TS-23.285-3GPP]
   [TR-22.886-3GPP][TS-23.287-3GPP].  With C-V2X, vehicles can directly
   communicate with each other without relay nodes (e.g., eNodeB in LTE
   and gNodeB in 5G).

   Along with these WAVE standards and C-V2X standards, regardless of a
   wireless access technology under the IP stack of a vehicle, vehicular
   networks can operate IP mobility with IPv6 [RFC8200] and Mobile IPv6
   protocols (e.g., Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) [RFC6275], Proxy MIPv6 (PMIPv6)
   [RFC5213], Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) [RFC7333], Locator/
   ID Separation Protocol (LISP) [RFC6830BIS], and Asymmetric Extended
   Route Optimization (AERO) [RFC6706BIS]).  In addition, ISO has
   approved a standard specifying the IPv6 network protocols and
   services to be used for Communications Access for Land Mobiles (CALM)
   [ISO-ITS-IPv6] [ISO-ITS-IPv6-AMD1].

   This document describes use cases and a problem statement about
   IPv6-based vehicular networking for ITS, which is named IPv6 Wireless
   Access in Vehicular Environments (IPWAVE).  First, it introduces the
   use cases for using V2V, V2I, and V2X networking in ITS.  Next, for
   IPv6-based vehicular networks, it makes a gap analysis of current
   IPv6 protocols (e.g., IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, Mobility Management,
   and Security & Privacy), and then lists up requirements for the
   extensions of those IPv6 protocols, which are tailored to IPv6-based
   vehicular networking.  Thus, this document is intended to motivate
   development of key protocols for IPWAVE.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology described in [RFC8691].  In
   addition, the following terms are defined below:

Internet-Draft          IPWAVE Problem Statement               July 2020


   o  Class-Based Safety Plan: A vehicle can make a safety plan by
      classifying the surrounding vehicles into different groups for
      safety purposes according to the geometrical relationship among
      them.  The vehicle groups can be classified as Line-of-Sight
      Unsafe, Non-Line-of-Sight Unsafe, and Safe groups [CASD].

   o  Context-Awareness: A vehicle can be aware of spatial-temporal
      mobility information (e.g., position, speed, direction, and
      acceleration/deceleration) of surrounding vehicles for both safety
      and non-safety uses through sensing or communication [CASD].

   o  DMM: "Distributed Mobility Management" [RFC7333][RFC7429].

   o  Edge Computing (EC): It is the local computing near an access
      network (i.e., edge network) for the sake of vehicles and
      pedestrians.

   o  Edge Computing Device (ECD): It is a computing device (or server)
      for edge computing for the sake of vehicles and pedestrians.

   o  Edge Network (EN): It is an access network that has an IP-RSU for
      wireless communication with other vehicles having an IP-OBU and
      wired communication with other network devices (e.g., routers, IP-
      RSUs, ECDs, servers, and MA).  It may have a Global Positioning
      System (GPS) radio receiver for its position recognition and the
      localization service for the sake of vehicles.

   o  IP-OBU: "Internet Protocol On-Board Unit": An IP-OBU denotes a
      computer situated in a vehicle (e.g., car, bicycle, autobike,
      motor cycle, and a similar one) and a device (e.g., smartphone and
      IoT device).  It has at least one IP interface that runs in IEEE
      802.11-OCB and has an "OBU" transceiver.  Also, it may have an IP
      interface that runs in Cellular V2X (C-V2X) [TS-23.285-3GPP]
      [TR-22.886-3GPP][TS-23.287-3GPP].  See the definition of the term
      "OBU" in [RFC8691].

   o  IP-RSU: "IP Roadside Unit": An IP-RSU is situated along the road.
      It has at least two distinct IP-enabled interfaces.  The wireless
      PHY/MAC layer of at least one of its IP-enabled interfaces is
      configured to operate in 802.11-OCB mode.  An IP-RSU communicates
      with the IP-OBU over an 802.11 wireless link operating in OCB
      mode.  Also, it may have an IP interface that runs in C-V2X along
      with an "RSU" transceiver.  An IP-RSU is similar to an Access
      Network Router (ANR), defined in [RFC3753], and a Wireless
      Termination Point (WTP), defined in [RFC5415].  See the definition
      of the term "RSU" in [RFC8691].

   o  LiDAR: "Light Detection and Ranging".  It is a scanning device to
      measure a distance to an object by emitting pulsed laser light and
      measuring the reflected pulsed light.

   o  Mobility Anchor (MA): A node that maintains IPv6 addresses and
      mobility information of vehicles in a road network to support
      their IPv6 address autoconfiguration and mobility management with
      a binding table.  An MA has End-to-End (E2E) connections (e.g.,
      tunnels) with IP-RSUs under its control for the address
      autoconfiguration and mobility management of the vehicles.  This
      MA is similar to a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) in PMIPv6 [RFC5213]
      for network-based mobility management.

   o  OCB: "Outside the Context of a Basic Service Set - BSS".  It is a
      mode of operation in which a Station (STA) is not a member of a
      BSS and does not utilize IEEE Std 802.11 authentication,
      association, or data confidentiality [IEEE-802.11-OCB].

   o  802.11-OCB: It refers to the mode specified in IEEE Std
      802.11-2016 [IEEE-802.11-OCB] when the MIB attribute
      dot11OCBActivited is 'true'.

   o  Platooning: Moving vehicles can be grouped together to reduce air-
      resistance for energy efficiency and reduce the number of drivers
      such that only the leading vehicle has a driver, and the other
      vehicles are autonomous vehicles without a driver and closely
      follow the leading vehicle [Truck-Platooning].

   o  Traffic Control Center (TCC): A system that manages road
      infrastructure nodes (e.g., IP-RSUs, MAs, traffic signals, and
      loop detectors), and also maintains vehicular traffic statistics
      (e.g., average vehicle speed and vehicle inter-arrival time per
      road segment) and vehicle information (e.g., a vehicle's
      identifier, position, direction, speed, and trajectory as a
      navigation path).  TCC is part of a vehicular cloud for vehicular
      networks.

   o  Vehicle: A Vehicle in this document is a node that has an IP-OBU
      for wireless communication with other vehicles and IP-RSUs.  It
      has a GPS radio navigation receiver for efficient navigation.  Any
      device having an IP-OBU and a GPS receiver (e.g., smartphone and
      table PC) can be regarded as a vehicle in this document.

   o  Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET): A network that consists of
      vehicles interconnected by wireless communication.  Two vehicles
      in a VANET can communicate with each other using other vehicles as
      relays even where they are out of one-hop wireless communication
      range.

   o  Vehicular Cloud: A cloud infrastructure for vehicular networks,
      having compute nodes, storage nodes, and network forwarding
      elements (e.g., switch and router).

   o  V2D: "Vehicle to Device".  It is the wireless communication
      between a vehicle and a device (e.g., smartphone and IoT device).

   o  V2I2D: "Vehicle to Infrastructure to Device".  It is the wireless
      communication between a vehicle and a device (e.g., smartphone and
      IoT device) via an infrastructure node (e.g., IP-RSU).

      communication between a vehicle and another vehicle via an
      infrastructure node (e.g., IP-RSU).

   o  V2I2X: "Vehicle to Infrastructure to Everything".  It is the
      wireless communication between a vehicle and another entity (e.g.,
      vehicle, smartphone, and IoT device) via an infrastructure node
      (e.g., IP-RSU).

   o  V2X: "Vehicle to Everything".  It is the wireless communication
      between a vehicle and any entity (e.g., vehicle, infrastructure
      node, smartphone, and IoT device), including V2V, V2I, and V2D.

3.  Use Cases

   This section explains use cases of V2V, V2I, and V2X networking.  The
   use cases of the V2X networking exclude the ones of the V2V and V2I
   networking, but include Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) and Vehicle-to-
   Device (V2D).

   IP is widely used among popular end-user devices (e.g., smartphone
   and tablet) in the Internet.  Applications (e.g., navigator
   application) for those devices can be extended such that the V2V use



Jeong, Ed.              Expires January 30, 2021                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft          IPWAVE Problem Statement               July 2020


   cases in this section can work with IPv6 as a network layer protocol
   and IEEE 802.11-OCB as a link layer protocol.  In addition, IPv6
   security needs to be extended to support those V2V use cases in a
   safe, secure, privacy-preserving way.

   The use cases presented in this section serve as the description and
   motivation for the need to extend IPv6 and its protocols to
   facilitate "Vehicular IPv6".  Section 5 summarizes the overall
   problem statement and IPv6 requirements.  Note that the adjective
   "Vehicular" in this document is used to represent extensions of
   existing protocols such as IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, IPv6 Mobility
   Management (e.g., PMIPv6 [RFC5213] and DMM [RFC7429]), and IPv6
   Security and Privacy Mechanisms rather than new "vehicular-specific"
   functions.  Refer to Section 5 for the problem statement of the
   requirements of vehicular IPv6.

3.1.  V2V

   The use cases of V2V networking discussed in this section include

   o  Context-aware navigation for safe driving and collision avoidance;

   o  Cooperative adaptive cruise control in a roadway;

   o  Platooning in a highway;

   o  Cooperative environment sensing;

   o  Collision avoidance service of end systems of Urban Air Mobility
      (UAM) [UAM-ITS].

   These five techniques will be important elements for autonomous
   vehicles, which may be either terrestrial vehicles or UAM end
   systems.

   Context-Aware Safety Driving (CASD) navigator [CASD] can help drivers
   to drive safely by alerting them to dangerous obstacles and
   situations.  That is, a CASD navigator displays obstacles or
   neighboring vehicles relevant to possible collisions in real-time
   through V2V networking.  CASD provides vehicles with a class-based
   automatic safety action plan, which considers three situations,
   namely, the Line-of-Sight unsafe, Non-Line-of-Sight unsafe, and safe
   situations.  This action plan can be put into action among multiple
   vehicles using V2V networking.

   Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) [CA-Cruise-Control] helps
   individual vehicles to adapt their speed autonomously through V2V
   communication among vehicles according to the mobility of their



Jeong, Ed.              Expires January 30, 2021                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          IPWAVE Problem Statement               July 2020


   predecessor and successor vehicles in an urban roadway or a highway.
   Thus, CACC can help adjacent vehicles to efficiently adjust their
   speed in an interactive way through V2V networking in order to avoid
   a collision.

   Platooning [Truck-Platooning] allows a series (or group) of vehicles
   (e.g., trucks) to follow each other very closely.  Trucks can use V2V
   communication in addition to forward sensors in order to maintain
   constant clearance between two consecutive vehicles at very short
   gaps (from 3 meters to 10 meters).  Platooning can maximize the
   throughput of vehicular traffic in a highway and reduce the gas
   consumption because the leading vehicle can help the following
   vehicles to experience less air resistance.

   Cooperative-environment-sensing use cases suggest that vehicles can
   share environmental information (e.g., air pollution, hazards/
   obstacles, slippery areas by snow or rain, road accidents, traffic
   congestion, and driving behaviors of neighboring vehicles) from
   various vehicle-mounted sensors, such as radars, LiDARs, and cameras,
   with other vehicles and pedestrians.  [Automotive-Sensing] introduces
   millimeter-wave vehicular communication for massive automotive
   sensing.  A lot of data can be generated by those sensors, and these
   data typically need to be routed to different destinations.  In
   addition, from the perspective of driverless vehicles, it is expected
   that driverless vehicles can be mixed with driver-operated vehicles.
   Through cooperative environment sensing, driver-operated vehicles can
   use environmental information sensed by driverless vehicles for
   better interaction with the other vehicles and environment.  Vehicles
   can also share their intended maneuvering information (e.g., lane
   change, speed change, ramp in-and-out, cut-in, and abrupt braking)
   with neighboring vehicles.  Thus, this information sharing can help
   the vehicles behave as more efficient traffic flows and minimize
   unnecessary acceleration and deceleration to achieve the best ride
   comfort.

   A collision avoidance service of UAM end systems in air can be
   envisioned as a use case in air vehicular environments.  This use
   case is similar to the context-aware navigator for terrestrial
   vehicles.  Through V2V coordination, those UAM end systems (e.g.,
   drones) can avoid a dangerous situation (e.g., collision) in three-
   dimensional space rather than two-dimensional space for terrestrial
   vehicles.  Also, UAM end systems (e.g., flying car) with only a few
   meters off the ground can communicate with terrestrial vehicles with
   wireless communication technologies (e.g., DSRC, LTE, and C-V2X).
   Thus, V2V means any vehicle to any vehicle, whether the vehicles are
   ground-level or not.

Internet-Draft          IPWAVE Problem Statement               July 2020


   To encourage more vehicles to participate in this cooperative
   environmental sensing, a reward system will be needed.  Sensing
   activities of each vehicle need to be logged in either a central way
   through a logging server (e.g., TCC) in the vehicular cloud or a
   distributed way (e.g., blockchain [Bitcoin]) through other vehicles
   or infrastructure.  In the case of a blockchain, each sensing message
   from a vehicle can be treated as a transaction and the neighboring
   vehicles can play the role of peers in a consensus method of a
   blockchain [Bitcoin][Vehicular-BlockChain].

   The existing IPv6 protocol must be augmented through the addition of
   an Overlay Multilink Network (OMNI) Interface [OMNI] and/or protocol
   changes in order to support wireless single-hop V2V communications as
   well as wireless multihop V2V communications.  Thus, the IPv6 needs
   to support both single-hop and multihop communications in a wireless
   medium so that vehicles can communicate with each other by V2V
   communications to share either an emergency situation or road hazard
   in a highway.

   To support applications of these V2V use cases, the functions of IPv6
   such as VND and VSP are prerequisites for IPv6-based packet exchange
   and secure, safe communication between two vehicles.

3.2.  V2I

   The use cases of V2I networking discussed in this section include

   o  Navigation service;

   o  Energy-efficient speed recommendation service;

   o  Accident notification service;

   o  Electric vehicle (EV) charging service;

   o  UAM navigation service with efficient battery charging.

   A navigation service, for example, the Self-Adaptive Interactive
   Navigation Tool(SAINT) [SAINT], using V2I networking interacts with a
   TCC for the large-scale/long-range road traffic optimization and can
   guide individual vehicles along appropriate navigation paths in real
   time.  The enhanced version of SAINT [SAINTplus] can give fast moving
   paths to emergency vehicles (e.g., ambulance and fire engine) to let
   them reach an accident spot while redirecting other vehicles near the
   accident spot into efficient detour paths.

   Either a TCC or an ECD can recommend an energy-efficient speed to a
   vehicle that depends on its traffic environment and traffic signal

   scheduling [SignalGuru].  For example, when a vehicle approaches an
   intersection area and a red traffic light for the vehicle becomes
   turned on, it needs to reduce its speed to save fuel consumption.  In
   this case, either a TCC or an ECD, which has the up-to-date
   trajectory of the vehicle and the traffic light schedule, can notify
   the vehicle of an appropriate speed for fuel efficiency.
   [Fuel-Efficient] studies fuel-efficient route and speed plans for
   platooned trucks.

   The emergency communication between accident vehicles (or emergency
   vehicles) and a TCC can be performed via either IP-RSU or 4G-LTE
   networks.  The First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet)
   [FirstNet] is provided by the US government to establish, operate,
   and maintain an interoperable public safety broadband network for
   safety and security network services, e.g., emergency calls.  The
   construction of the nationwide FirstNet network requires each state
   in the US to have a Radio Access Network (RAN) that will connect to
   the FirstNet's network core.  The current RAN is mainly constructed
   using 4G-LTE for the communication between a vehicle and an
   infrastructure node (i.e., V2I) [FirstNet-Report], but it is expected
   that DSRC-based vehicular networks [DSRC] will be available for V2I
   and V2V in the near future.

   An EV charging service with V2I can facilitates the efficient battery
   charging of EVs.  In the case where an EV charging station is
   connected to an IP-RSU, an EV can be guided toward the deck of the EV
   charging station through a battery charging server connected to the
   IP-RSU.  In addition to this EV charging service, other value-added
   services (e.g., air firmware/software update and media streaming) can
   be provided to an EV while it is charging its battery at the EV
   charging station.

   A UAM navigation service with efficient battery charging can make the
   battery charging schedule of UAM end systems (e.g., drone) for long-
   distance flying [CBDN].  For this battery charging schedule, a UAM
   end system can communicate with an infrastructure node (e.g., IP-RSU)
   toward a cloud server via V2I communications.  This cloud server can
   coordinate the battery charging schedules of multiple UAM end systems
   for their efficient navigation path, considering flight time from
   their current position to a battery charging station, waiting time in
   a waiting queue at the station, and battery charging time at the
   station.

   The existing IPv6 protocol must be augmented through the addition of
   an OMNI interface and/or protocol changes in order to support
   wireless multihop V2I communications in a highway where RSUs are
   sparsely deployed, so a vehicle can reach the wireless coverage of an

   RSU through the multihop data forwarding of intermediate vehicles.
   Thus, IPv6 needs to be extended for multihop V2I communications.

   To support applications of these V2I use cases, the functions of IPv6
   such as VND, VMM, and VSP are prerequisites for IPv6-based packet
   exchange, transport-layer session continuity, and secure, safe
   communication between a vehicle and a server in the vehicular cloud.

3.3.  V2X

   The use case of V2X networking discussed in this section is for a
   pedestrian protection service.

   A pedestrian protection service, such as Safety-Aware Navigation
   Application (SANA) [SANA], using V2I2P networking can reduce the
   collision of a vehicle and a pedestrian carrying a smartphone
   equipped with a network device for wireless communication (e.g., Wi-
   Fi) with an IP-RSU.  Vehicles and pedestrians can also communicate
   with each other via an IP-RSU.  An edge computing device behind the
   IP-RSU can collect the mobility information from vehicles and
   pedestrians, compute wireless communication scheduling for the sake
   of them.  This scheduling can save the battery of each pedestrian's
   smartphone by allowing it to work in sleeping mode before the
   communication with vehicles, considering their mobility.

   For Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P), a vehicle can directly communicate
   with a pedestrian's smartphone by V2X without IP-RSU relaying.
   Light-weight mobile nodes such as bicycles may also communicate
   directly with a vehicle for collision avoidance using V2V.

   The existing IPv6 protocol must be augmented through the addition of
   an OMNI interface and/or protocol changes in order to support
   wireless multihop V2X (or V2I2X) communications in an urban road
   network where RSUs are deployed at intersections, so a vehicle (or a
   pedestrian's smartphone) can reach the wireless coverage of an RSU
   through the multihop data forwarding of intermediate vehicles (or
   pedestrians' smartphones).  Thus, IPv6 needs to be extended for
   multihop V2X (or V2I2X) communications.

   To support applications of these V2X use cases, the functions of IPv6
   such as VND, VMM, and VSP are prerequisites for IPv6-based packet
   exchange, transport-layer session continuity, and secure, safe
   communication between a vehicle and a pedestrian either directly or
   indirectly via an IP-RSU.

4.  Vehicular Networks

   This section describes an example vehicular network architecture
   supporting V2V, V2I, and V2X communications in vehicular networks.
   It describes an internal network within a vehicle or an edge network
   (called EN).  It explains not only the internetworking between the
   internal networks of a vehicle and an EN via wireless links, but also
   the internetworking between the internal networks of two vehicles via
   wireless links.

4.1.  Vehicular Network Architecture

   Figure 1 shows an example vehicular network architecture for V2I and
   V2V in a road network [OMNI].  The vehicular network architecture
   contains vehicles (including IP-OBU), IP-RSUs, Mobility Anchor,
   Traffic Control Center, and Vehicular Cloud as components.  Note that
   the components of the vehicular network architecture can be mapped to
   those of an IP-based aeronautical network architecture in [OMNI], as
   shown in Figure 2.

        +-------------------+------------------------------------+

        Figure 2: Mapping between Vehicular Network Components and
                      Aeronautical Network Components

   These components are not mandatory, and they can be deployed into
   vehicular networks in various ways.  Some of them (e.g., Mobility
   Anchor, Traffic Control Center, and Vehicular Cloud) may not be
   needed for the vehicular networks according to target use cases in
   Section 3.

   An existing network architecture (e.g., an IP-based aeronautical
   network architecture [OMNI][UAM-ITS], a network architecture of
   PMIPv6 [RFC5213], and a low-power and lossy network architecture
   [RFC6550]) can be extended to a vehicular network architecture for
   multihop V2V, V2I, and V2X, as shown in Figure 1.  In a highway
   scenario, a vehicle may not access an RSU directly because of the
   distance of the DSRC coverage (up to 1 km).  For example, the OMNI
   interface and/or RPL (IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy
   Networks) [RFC6550] can be extended to support a multihop V2I since a
   vehicle can take advantage of other vehicles as relay nodes to reach
   the RSU.  Also, RPL can be extended to support both multihop V2V and
   V2X in the similar way.

   Wireless communications needs to be considered for end systems for
   Urban Air Mobility (UAM) such as flying cars and taxis [UAM-ITS].



Jeong, Ed.              Expires January 30, 2021               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft          IPWAVE Problem Statement               July 2020


   These UAM end systems may have multiple wireless transmission media
   interfaces (e.g., cellular, communications satellite (SATCOM), short-
   range omni-directional interfaces), which are offered by different
   data link service providers.  To support not only the mobility
   management of the UAM end systems, but also the multihop and
   multilink communications of the UAM interfaces, the UAM end systems
   can employ an Overlay Multilink Network (OMNI) interface [OMNI] as a
   virtual Non-Broadcast Multiple Access (NBMA) connection to a serving
   ground domain infrastructure.  This infrastructure can be configured
   over the underlying data links.  The OMNI interface and its link
   model provide a means of multilink, multihop and mobility
   coordination to the legacy IPv6 ND messaging [RFC4861] according to
   the NBMA principle.  Thus, the OMNI link model can support efficient
   UAM internetworking services without additional mobility messaging,
   and without any modification to the IPv6 ND messaging services or
   link model.

   As shown in this figure, IP-RSUs as routers and vehicles with IP-OBU
   have wireless media interfaces for VANET.  Furthermore, the wireless
   media interfaces are autoconfigured with a global IPv6 prefix (e.g.,
   2001:DB8:1:1::/64) to support both V2V and V2I networking.  Note that
   2001:DB8::/32 is a documentation prefix [RFC3849] for example
   prefixes in this document, and also that any routable IPv6 address
   needs to be routable in a VANET and a vehicular network including IP-
   RSUs.

   In Figure 1, three IP-RSUs (IP-RSU1, IP-RSU2, and IP-RSU3) are
   deployed in the road network and are connected with each other
   through the wired networks (e.g., Ethernet).  A Traffic Control
   Center (TCC) is connected to the Vehicular Cloud for the management
   of IP-RSUs and vehicles in the road network.  A Mobility Anchor (MA)
   may be located in the TCC as a mobility management controller.
   Vehicle2, Vehicle3, and Vehicle4 are wirelessly connected to IP-RSU1,
   IP-RSU2, and IP-RSU3, respectively.  The three wireless networks of
   IP-RSU1, IP-RSU2, and IP-RSU3 can belong to three different subnets
   (i.e., Subnet1, Subnet2, and Subnet3), respectively.  Those three
   subnets use three different prefixes (i.e., Prefix1, Prefix2, and
   Prefix3).

   Multiple vehicles under the coverage of an RSU share a prefix such
   that mobile nodes share a prefix of a Wi-Fi access point in a
   wireless LAN.  This is a natural characteristic in infrastructure-
   based wireless networks.  For example, in Figure 1, two vehicles
   (i.e., Vehicle2, and Vehicle5) can use Prefix 1 to configure their
   IPv6 global addresses for V2I communication.  Alternatively, mobile
   nodes can employ an OMNI interface and use their own IPv6 Unique
   Local Addresses (ULAs) [RFC4193] over the wireless network without
   requiring the messaging of IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration



Jeong, Ed.              Expires January 30, 2021               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft          IPWAVE Problem Statement               July 2020


   (SLAAC) [RFC4862], which uses an on-link prefix provided by the
   (visited) wireless LAN; this technique is known as "Bring-Your-Own-
   Addresses".

   A single subnet prefix announced by an RSU can span multiple vehicles
   in VANET.  For example, in Figure 1, for Prefix 1, three vehicles
   (i.e., Vehicle1, Vehicle2, and Vehicle5) can construct a connected
   VANET.  Also, for Prefix 2, two vehicles (i.e., Vehicle3 and
   Vehicle6) can construct another connected VANET, and for Prefix 3,
   two vehicles (i.e., Vehicle4 and Vehicle7) can construct another
   connected VANET.  Alternatively, each vehicle could employ an OMNI
   interface with their own ULAs such that no topologically-oriented
   subnet prefixes need be announced by the RSU.

   In wireless subnets in vehicular networks (e.g., Subnet1 and Subnet2
   in Figure 1), vehicles can construct a connected VANET (with an
   arbitrary graph topology) and can communicate with each other via V2V
   communication.  Vehicle1 can communicate with Vehicle2 via V2V
   communication, and Vehicle2 can communicate with Vehicle3 via V2V
   communication because they are within the wireless communication
   range of each other.  On the other hand, Vehicle3 can communicate
   with Vehicle4 via the vehicular infrastructure (i.e., IP-RSU2 and IP-
   RSU3) by employing V2I (i.e., V2I2V) communication because they are
   not within the wireless communication range of each other.

   For IPv6 packets transported over IEEE 802.11-OCB, [RFC8691]
   specifies several details, including Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU),
   frame format, link-local address, address mapping for unicast and
   multicast, stateless autoconfiguration, and subnet structure.  An
   Ethernet Adaptation (EA) layer is in charge of transforming some
   parameters between the IEEE 802.11 MAC layer and the IPv6 network
   layer, which is located between the IEEE 802.11-OCB's logical link
   control layer and the IPv6 network layer.  This IPv6 over 802.11-OCB
   can be used for both V2V and V2I in IPv6-based vehicular networks.

   An IPv6 mobility solution is needed for the guarantee of
   communication continuity in vehicular networks so that a vehicle's
   TCP session can be continued, or UDP packets can be delivered to a
   vehicle as a destination without loss while it moves from an IP-RSU's
   wireless coverage to another IP-RSU's wireless coverage.  In
   Figure 1, assuming that Vehicle2 has a TCP session (or a UDP session)
   with a corresponding node in the vehicular cloud, Vehicle2 can move
   from IP-RSU1's wireless coverage to IP-RSU2's wireless coverage.  In
   this case, a handover for Vehicle2 needs to be performed by either a
   host-based mobility management scheme (e.g., MIPv6 [RFC6275]) or a
   network-based mobility management scheme (e.g., PMIPv6 [RFC5213] and
   AERO [RFC6706BIS]).




Jeong, Ed.              Expires January 30, 2021               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft          IPWAVE Problem Statement               July 2020


   In the host-based mobility scheme (e.g., MIPv6), an IP-RSU plays a
   role of a home agent.  On the other hand, in the network-based
   mobility scheme (e.g., PMIPv6, an MA plays a role of a mobility
   management controller such as a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) in
   PMIPv6, which also serves vehicles as a home agent, and an IP-RSU
   plays a role of an access router such as a Mobile Access Gateway
   (MAG) in PMIPv6 [RFC5213].  The host-based mobility scheme needs
   client functionality in IPv6 stack of a vehicle as a mobile node for
   mobility signaling message exchange between the vehicle and home
   agent.  On the other hand, the network-based mobility scheme does not
   need such a client functionality for a vehicle because the network
   infrastructure node (e.g., MAG in PMIPv6) as a proxy mobility agent
   handles the mobility signaling message exchange with the home agent
   (e.g., LMA in PMIPv6) for the sake of the vehicle.

   There are a scalability issue and a route optimization issue in the
   network-based mobility scheme (e.g., PMIPv6) when an MA covers a
   large vehicular network governing many IP-RSUs.  In this case, a
   distributed mobility scheme (e.g., DMM [RFC7429]) can mitigate the
   scalability issue by distributing multiple MAs in the vehicular
   network such that they are positioned closer to vehicles for route
   optimization and bottleneck mitigation in a central MA in the
   network-based mobility scheme.  All these mobility approaches (i.e.,
   a host-based mobility scheme, network-based mobility scheme, and
   distributed mobility scheme) and a hybrid approach of a combination
   of them need to provide an efficient mobility service to vehicles
   moving fast and moving along with the relatively predictable
   trajectories along the roadways.

   In vehicular networks, the control plane can be separated from the
   data plane for efficient mobility management and data forwarding by
   using the concept of Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
   [RFC7149][DMM-FPC].  Note that Forwarding Policy Configuration (FPC)
   in [DMM-FPC], which is a flexible mobility management system, can
   manage the separation of data-plane and control-plane in DMM.  In
   SDN, the control plane and data plane are separated for the efficient
   management of forwarding elements (e.g., switches and routers) where
   an SDN controller configures the forwarding elements in a centralized
   way and they perform packet forwarding according to their forwarding
   tables that are configured by the SDN controller.  An MA as an SDN
   controller needs to efficiently configure and monitor its IP-RSUs and
   vehicles for mobility management, location management, and security
   services.

   The mobility information of a GPS receiver mounted in its vehicle
   (e.g., position, speed, and direction) can be used to accommodate
   mobility-aware proactive handover schemes, which can perform the

   handover of a vehicle according to its mobility and the wireless
   signal strength of a vehicle and an IP-RSU in a proactive way.

   Vehicles can use the TCC as their Home Network having a home agent
   for mobility management as in MIPv6 [RFC6275] and PMIPv6 [RFC5213],
   so the TCC (or an MA inside the TCC) maintains the mobility
   information of vehicles for location management.  IP tunneling over
   the wireless link should be avoided for performance efficiency.
   Also, in vehicular networks, asymmetric links sometimes exist and
   must be considered for wireless communications such as V2V and V2I.

4.2.  V2I-based Internetworking

   This section discusses the internetworking between a vehicle's
   internal network (i.e., moving network) and an EN's internal network
   (i.e., fixed network) via V2I communication.  The internal network of
   a vehicle is nowadays constructed with Ethernet by many automotive
   vendors [In-Car-Network].  Note that an EN can accommodate multiple
   routers (or switches) and servers (e.g., ECDs, navigation server, and
   DNS server) in its internal network.

   A vehicle's internal network often uses Ethernet to interconnect
   Electronic Control Units (ECUs) in the vehicle.  The internal network
   can support Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to accommodate a driver's and
   passenger's mobile devices (e.g., smartphone or tablet).  The network
   topology and subnetting depend on each vendor's network configuration
   for a vehicle and an EN.  It is reasonable to consider the
   interaction between the internal network and an external network
   within another vehicle or an EN.

        Figure 3: Internetworking between Vehicle and Edge Network

   As shown in Figure 3, as internal networks, a vehicle's moving
   network and an EN's fixed network are self-contained networks having
   multiple subnets and having an edge router (e.g., IP-OBU and IP-RSU)
   for the communication with another vehicle or another EN.  The
   internetworking between two internal networks via V2I communication
   requires the exchange of the network parameters and the network
   prefixes of the internal networks.  For the efficiency, the network
   prefixes of the internal networks (as a moving network) in a vehicle
   need to be delegated and configured automatically.  Note that a
   moving network's network prefix can be called a Mobile Network Prefix
   (MNP) [OMNI].

   Figure 3 also shows the internetworking between the vehicle's moving
   network and the EN's fixed network.  There exists an internal network
   (Moving Network1) inside Vehicle1.  Vehicle1 has two hosts (Host1 and
   Host2), and two routers (IP-OBU1 and Router1).  There exists another
   internal network (Fixed Network1) inside EN1.  EN1 has one host
   (Host3), two routers (IP-RSU1 and Router2), and the collection of

   servers (Server1 to ServerN) for various services in the road
   networks, such as the emergency notification and navigation.
   Vehicle1's IP-OBU1 (as a mobile router) and EN1's IP-RSU1 (as a fixed
   router) use 2001:DB8:1:1::/64 for an external link (e.g., DSRC) for
   V2I networking.  Thus, a host (Host1) in Vehicle1 can communicate
   with a server (Server1) in EN1 for a vehicular service through
   Vehicle1's moving network, a wireless link between IP-OBU1 and IP-
   RSU1, and EN1's fixed network.

   For the IPv6 communication between an IP-OBU and an IP-RSU or between
   two neighboring IP-OBUs, they need to know the network parameters,
   which include MAC layer and IPv6 layer information.  The MAC layer
   information includes wireless link layer parameters, transmission
   power level, and the MAC address of an external network interface for
   the internetworking with another IP-OBU or IP-RSU.  The IPv6 layer
   information includes the IPv6 address and network prefix of an
   external network interface for the internetworking with another IP-
   OBU or IP-RSU.

   Through the mutual knowledge of the network parameters of internal
   networks, packets can be transmitted between the vehicle's moving
   network and the EN's fixed network.  Thus, V2I requires an efficient
   protocol for the mutual knowledge of network parameters.

   As shown in Figure 3, the addresses used for IPv6 transmissions over
   the wireless link interfaces for IP-OBU and IP-RSU can be either
   global IPv6 addresses, or IPv6 ULAs as long as IPv6 packets can be
   routed within vehicular networks [OMNI].  When global IPv6 addresses
   are used, wireless interface configuration and control overhead for
   Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) [RFC4862] and Multicast Listener
   Discovery (MLD) [RFC2710][RFC3810] should be minimized to support V2I
   and V2X communications for vehicles moving fast along roadways; when
   ULAs and the OMNI interface are used, no DAD nor MLD messaging is
   needed.

   networks of two neighboring vehicles via V2V communication.

              Figure 4: Internetworking between Two Vehicles

   Figure 4 shows the internetworking between the moving networks of two
   neighboring vehicles.  There exists an internal network (Moving
   Network1) inside Vehicle1.  Vehicle1 has two hosts (Host1 and Host2),
   and two routers (IP-OBU1 and Router1).  There exists another internal
   network (Moving Network2) inside Vehicle2.  Vehicle2 has two hosts
   (Host3 and Host4), and two routers (IP-OBU2 and Router2).  Vehicle1's
   IP-OBU1 (as a mobile router) and Vehicle2's IP-OBU2 (as a mobile
   router) use 2001:DB8:1:1::/64 for an external link (e.g., DSRC) for
   V2V networking.  Alternatively, Vehicle1 and Vehicle2 employ an OMNI
   interface and use IPv6 ULAs for V2V networking.  Thus, a host (Host1)
   in Vehicle1 can communicate with another host (Host3) in Vehicle2 for
   a vehicular service through Vehicle1's moving network, a wireless
   link between IP-OBU1 and IP-OBU2, and Vehicle2's moving network.

   As a V2V use case in Section 3.1, Figure 5 shows the linear network
   topology of platooning vehicles for V2V communications where Vehicle3
   is the leading vehicle with a driver, and Vehicle2 and Vehicle1 are
   the following vehicles without drivers.

      Figure 5: Multihop Internetworking between Two Vehicle Networks

   As shown in Figure 5, multihop internetworking is feasible among the
   moving networks of three vehicles in the same VANET.  For example,
   Host1 in Vehicle1 can communicate with Host3 in Vehicle3 via IP-OBU1
   in Vehicle1, IP-OBU2 in Vehicle2, and IP-OBU3 in Vehicle3 in the
   linear network, as shown in the figure.

5.  Problem Statement

   In order to specify protocols using the architecture mentioned in
   Section 4.1, IPv6 core protocols have to be adapted to overcome
   certain challenging aspects of vehicular networking.  Since the
   vehicles are likely to be moving at great speed, protocol exchanges
   need to be completed in a time relatively short compared to the
   lifetime of a link between a vehicle and an IP-RSU, or between two
   vehicles.

   Note that if two vehicles are moving in the opposite directions in a
   roadway, the relative speed of this case is two times the relative
   speed of a vehicle passing through an RSU.  The time constraint of a
   wireless link between two nodes needs to be considered because it may
   affect the lifetime of a session involving the link.

   The lifetime of a session varies depending on the session's type such
   as a web surfing, voice call over IP, and DNS query.  Regardless of a
   session's type, to guide all the IPv6 packets to their destination
   host, IP mobility should be supported for the session.

Internet-Draft          IPWAVE Problem Statement               July 2020


   Thus, the time constraint of a wireless link has a major impact on
   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND).  Mobility Management (MM) is also
   vulnerable to disconnections that occur before the completion of
   identity verification and tunnel management.  This is especially true
   given the unreliable nature of wireless communication.  This section
   presents key topics such as neighbor discovery and mobility
   management.

5.1.  Neighbor Discovery

   IPv6 ND [RFC4861][RFC4862] is a core part of the IPv6 protocol suite.
   IPv6 ND is designed for link types including point-to-point,
   multicast-capable (e.g., Ethernet) and Non-Broadcast Multiple Access
   (NBMA).  It assumes the efficient and reliable support of multicast
   and unicast from the link layer for various network operations such
   as MAC Address Resolution (AR), DAD, MLD and Neighbor Unreachability
   Detection (NUD).

   Vehicles move quickly within the communication coverage of any
   particular vehicle or IP-RSU.  Before the vehicles can exchange
   application messages with each other, they need to be configured with
   a link-local IPv6 address or a global IPv6 address, and run IPv6 ND.

   The requirements for IPv6 ND for vehicular networks are efficient DAD
   and NUD operations.  An efficient DAD is required to reduce the
   overhead of the DAD packets during a vehicle's travel in a road
   network, which guaranteeing the uniqueness of a vehicle's global IPv6
   address.  An efficient NUD is required to reduce the overhead of the
   NUD packets during a vehicle's travel in a road network, which
   guaranteeing the accurate neighborhood information of a vehicle in
   terms of adjacent vehicles and RSUs.

   The legacy DAD assumes that a node with an IPv6 address can reach any
   other node with the scope of its address at the time it claims its
   address, and can hear any future claim for that address by another
   party within the scope of its address for the duration of the address
   ownership.  However, the partitioning and merging of VANETs makes
   this assumption frequently invalid in vehicular networks.  The
   merging and partitioning of VANETs frequently occurs in vehicular
   networks.  This merging and partitioning should be considered for the
   IPv6 ND such as IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
   [RFC4862].  Due to the merging of VANETs, two IPv6 addresses may
   conflict with each other though they were unique before the merging.
   Also, the partitioning of a VANET may make vehicles with the same
   prefix be physically unreachable.  Also, SLAAC needs to prevent IPv6
   address duplication due to the merging of VANETs.  According to the
   merging and partitioning, a destination vehicle (as an IPv6 host)
   needs to be distinguished as either an on-link host or an off-link



Jeong, Ed.              Expires January 30, 2021               [Page 22]

Internet-Draft          IPWAVE Problem Statement               July 2020


   host even though the source vehicle uses the same prefix as the
   destination vehicle.

   To efficiently prevent IPv6 address duplication due to the VANET
   partitioning and merging from happening in vehicular networks, the
   vehicular networks need to support a vehicular-network-wide DAD by
   defining a scope that is compatible with the legacy DAD.  In this
   case, two vehicles can communicate with each other when there exists
   a communication path over VANET or a combination of VANETs and IP-
   RSUs, as shown in Figure 1.  By using the vehicular-network-wide DAD,
   vehicles can assure that their IPv6 addresses are unique in the
   vehicular network whenever they are connected to the vehicular
   infrastructure or become disconnected from it in the form of VANET.

   ND time-related parameters such as router lifetime and Neighbor
   Advertisement (NA) interval need to be adjusted for vehicle speed and
   vehicle density.  For example, the NA interval needs to be
   dynamically adjusted according to a vehicle's speed so that the
   vehicle can maintain its neighboring vehicles in a stable way,
   considering the collision probability with the NA messages sent by
   other vehicles.

   For IPv6-based safety applications (e.g., context-aware navigation,
   adaptive cruise control, and platooning) in vehicular networks, the
   delay-bounded data delivery is critical.  IPv6 ND needs to work to
   support those IPv6-based safety applications efficiently.

   Thus, in IPv6-based vehicular networking, IPv6 ND should have minimum
   changes for the interoperability with the legacy IPv6 ND used in the
   Internet, including the DAD and NUD operations.

5.1.1.  Link Model

   A prefix model for a vehicular network needs to facilitate the
   communication between two vehicles with the same prefix regardless of
   the vehicular network topology as long as there exist bidirectional
   E2E paths between them in the vehicular network including VANETs and
   IP-RSUs.  This prefix model allows vehicles with the same prefix to
   communicate with each other via a combination of multihop V2V and
   multihop V2I with VANETs and IP-RSUs.  Note that the OMNI interface
   supports an NBMA link model where multihop V2V and V2I communications
   use each mobile node's ULAs without need for any DAD or MLD
   messaging.

   IPv6 protocols work under certain assumptions that do not necessarily
   hold for vehicular wireless access link types other than OMNI/NBMA
   [VIP-WAVE][RFC5889]; the rest of this section discusses implications
   for those link types that do not apply when the OMNI/NBMA link model



Jeong, Ed.              Expires January 30, 2021               [Page 23]

Internet-Draft          IPWAVE Problem Statement               July 2020


   is used.  For instance, some IPv6 protocols assume symmetry in the
   connectivity among neighboring interfaces [RFC6250].  However, radio
   interference and different levels of transmission power may cause
   asymmetric links to appear in vehicular wireless links.  As a result,
   a new vehicular link model needs to consider the asymmetry of
   dynamically changing vehicular wireless links.

   There is a relationship between a link and a prefix, besides the
   different scopes that are expected from the link-local and global
   types of IPv6 addresses.  In an IPv6 link, it is assumed that all
   interfaces which are configured with the same subnet prefix and with
   on-link bit set can communicate with each other on an IPv6 link.
   However, the vehicular link model needs to define the relationship
   between a link and a prefix, considering the dynamics of wireless
   links and the characteristics of VANET.

   A VANET can have a single link between each vehicle pair within
   wireless communication range, as shown in Figure 5.  When two
   vehicles belong to the same VANET, but they are out of wireless
   communication range, they cannot communicate directly with each
   other.  Suppose that a global-scope IPv6 prefix (or an IPv6 ULA
   prefix) is assigned to VANETs in vehicular networks.  Even though two
   vehicles in the same VANET configure their IPv6 addresses with the
   same IPv6 prefix, they may not communicate with each other not in one
   hop in the same VANET because of the multihop network connectivity
   between them.  Thus, in this case, the concept of an on-link IPv6
   prefix does not hold because two vehicles with the same on-link IPv6
   prefix cannot communicate directly with each other.  Also, when two
   vehicles are located in two different VANETs with the same IPv6
   prefix, they cannot communicate with each other.  When these two
   VANETs converge to one VANET, the two vehicles can communicate with
   each other in a multihop fashion, for example, when they are Vehicle1
   and Vehicle3, as shown in Figure 5.

   From the previous observation, a vehicular link model should consider
   the frequent partitioning and merging of VANETs due to vehicle
   mobility.  Therefore, the vehicular link model needs to use an on-
   link prefix and off-link prefix according to the network topology of
   vehicles such as a one-hop reachable network and a multihop reachable
   network (or partitioned networks).  If the vehicles with the same
   prefix are reachable from each other in one hop, the prefix should be
   on-link.  On the other hand, if some of the vehicles with the same
   prefix are not reachable from each other in one hop due to either the
   multihop topology in the VANET or multiple partitions, the prefix
   should be off-link.

   The vehicular link model needs to support multihop routing in a
   connected VANET where the vehicles with the same global-scope IPv6



Jeong, Ed.              Expires January 30, 2021               [Page 24]

Internet-Draft          IPWAVE Problem Statement               July 2020


   prefix (or the same IPv6 ULA prefix) are connected in one hop or
   multiple hops.  It also needs to support the multihop routing in
   multiple connected VANETs through infrastructure nodes (e.g., IP-RSU)
   where they are connected to the infrastructure.  For example, in
   Figure 1, suppose that Vehicle1, Vehicle2, and Vehicle3 are
   configured with their IPv6 addresses based on the same global-scope
   IPv6 prefix.  Vehicle1 and Vehicle3 can also communicate with each
   other via either multihop V2V or multihop V2I2V.  When Vehicle1 and
   Vehicle3 are connected in a VANET, it will be more efficient for them
   to communicate with each other directly via VANET rather than
   indirectly via IP-RSUs.  On the other hand, when Vehicle1 and
   Vehicle3 are far away from direct communication range in separate
   VANETs and under two different IP-RSUs, they can communicate with
   each other through the relay of IP-RSUs via V2I2V.  Thus, two
   separate VANETs can merge into one network via IP-RSU(s).  Also,
   newly arriving vehicles can merge two separate VANETs into one VANET
   if they can play the role of a relay node for those VANETs.

   Thus, in IPv6-based vehicular networking, the vehicular link model
   should have minimum changes for interoperability with standard IPv6
   links in an efficient fashion to support IPv6 DAD, MLD and NUD
   operations.  When the OMNI NBMA link model is used, there are no link
   model changes nor DAD/MLD messaging required.

5.1.2.  MAC Address Pseudonym

   For the protection of drivers' privacy, a pseudonym of a MAC address
   of a vehicle's network interface should be used, so that the MAC
   address can be changed periodically.  However, although such a
   pseudonym of a MAC address can protect to some extent the privacy of
   a vehicle, it may not be able to resist attacks on vehicle
   identification by other fingerprint information, for example, the
   scrambler seed embedded in IEEE 802.11-OCB frames [Scrambler-Attack].
   The pseudonym of a MAC address affects an IPv6 address based on the
   MAC address, and a transport-layer (e.g., TCP and SCTP) session with
   an IPv6 address pair.  However, the pseudonym handling is not
   implemented and tested yet for applications on IP-based vehicular
   networking.

   In the ETSI standards, for the sake of security and privacy, an ITS
   station (e.g., vehicle) can use pseudonyms for its network interface
   identities (e.g., MAC address) and the corresponding IPv6 addresses
   [Identity-Management].  Whenever the network interface identifier
   changes, the IPv6 address based on the network interface identifier
   needs to be updated, and the uniqueness of the address needs to be
   checked through the DAD procedure.  For vehicular networks with high
   mobility and density, this DAD needs to be performed efficiently with
   minimum overhead so that the vehicles can exchange application

   messages (e.g., collision avoidance and accident notification) with
   each other with a short interval (e.g., 0.5 second)
   [NHTSA-ACAS-Report].

5.1.3.  Routing

   For multihop V2V communications in either a VANET or VANETs via IP-
   RSUs, a vehicular Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANET) routing protocol may
   be required to support both unicast and multicast in the links of the
   subnet with the same IPv6 prefix.  However, it will be costly to run
   both vehicular ND and a vehicular ad hoc routing protocol in terms of
   control traffic overhead [ID-Multicast-Problems].

   A routing protocol for a VANET may cause redundant wireless frames in
   the air to check the neighborhood of each vehicle and compute the
   routing information in a VANET with a dynamic network topology
   because the IPv6 ND is used to check the neighborhood of each
   vehicle.  Thus, the vehicular routing needs to take advantage of the
   IPv6 ND to minimize its control overhead.

5.2.  Mobility Management

   The seamless connectivity and timely data exchange between two end
   points requires efficient mobility management including location
   management and handover.  Most vehicles are equipped with a GPS
   receiver as part of a dedicated navigation system or a corresponding
   smartphone App.  Note that the GPS receiver may not provide vehicles
   with accurate location information in adverse environments such as a
   building area or a tunnel.  The location precision can be improved
   with assistance of the IP-RSUs or a cellular system with a GPS
   receiver for location information.

   With a GPS navigator, efficient mobility management can be performed
   with the help of vehicles periodically reporting their current
   position and trajectory (i.e., navigation path) to the vehicular
   infrastructure (having IP-RSUs and an MA in TCC).  This vehicular
   infrastructure can predict the future positions of the vehicles from
   their mobility information (i.e., the current position, speed,
   direction, and trajectory) for efficient mobility management (e.g.,
   proactive handover).  For a better proactive handover, link-layer
   parameters, such as the signal strength of a link-layer frame (e.g.,
   Received Channel Power Indicator (RCPI) [VIP-WAVE]), can be used to
   determine the moment of a handover between IP-RSUs along with
   mobility information.

   By predicting a vehicle's mobility, the vehicular infrastructure
   needs to better support IP-RSUs to perform efficient SLAAC, data
   forwarding, horizontal handover (i.e., handover in wireless links



Jeong, Ed.              Expires January 30, 2021               [Page 26]

   using a homogeneous radio technology), and vertical handover (i.e.,
   handover in wireless links using heterogeneous radio technologies) in
   advance along with the movement of the vehicle.

   For example, as shown in Figure 1, when a vehicle (e.g., Vehicle2) is
   moving from the coverage of an IP-RSU (e.g., IP-RSU1) into the
   coverage of another IP-RSU (e.g., IP-RSU2) belonging to a different
   subnet, the IP-RSUs can proactively support the IPv6 mobility of the
   vehicle, while performing the SLAAC, data forwarding, and handover
   for the sake of the vehicle.

   For a mobility management scheme in a shared link, where the wireless
   subnets of multiple IP-RSUs share the same prefix, an efficient
   vehicular-network-wide DAD is required.  If DHCPv6 is used to assign
   a unique IPv6 address to each vehicle in this shared link, the DAD is
   not required.  On the other hand, for a mobility management scheme
   with a unique prefix per mobile node (e.g., PMIPv6 [RFC5213] and OMNI
   [OMNI]), DAD is not required because the IPv6 address of a vehicle's
   external wireless interface is guaranteed to be unique.  There is a
   tradeoff between the prefix usage efficiency and DAD overhead.  Thus,
   the IPv6 address autoconfiguration for vehicular networks needs to
   consider this tradeoff to support efficient mobility management.

   Therefore, for the proactive and seamless IPv6 mobility of vehicles,
   the vehicular infrastructure (including IP-RSUs and MA) needs to
   efficiently perform the mobility management of the vehicles with
   their mobility information and link-layer information.  Also, in
   IPv6-based vehicular networking, IPv6 mobility management should have
   minimum changes for the interoperability with the legacy IPv6
   mobility management schemes such as PMIPv6, DMM, LISP, and AERO.

6.  Security Considerations

   This section discusses security and privacy for IPv6-based vehicular
   networking.  Security and privacy are key components of IPv6-based
   vehicular networking along with neighbor discovery and mobility
   management.

   Security and privacy are paramount in V2I, V2V, and V2X networking.
   Vehicles and infrastructure must be authenticated in order to
   participate in vehicular networking.  Also, in-vehicle devices (e.g.,
   ECU) and a driver/passenger's mobile devices (e.g., smartphone and
   tablet PC) in a vehicle need to communicate with other in-vehicle
   devices and another driver/passenger's mobile devices in another
   vehicle, or other servers behind an IP-RSU in a secure way.  Even
   though a vehicle is perfectly authenticated and legitimate, it may be
   hacked for running malicious applications to track and collect its
   and other vehicles' information.  In this case, an attack mitigation



Jeong, Ed.              Expires January 30, 2021               [Page 27]

Internet-Draft          IPWAVE Problem Statement               July 2020


   process may be required to reduce the aftermath of malicious
   behaviors.

   Strong security measures shall protect vehicles roaming in road
   networks from the attacks of malicious nodes, which are controlled by
   hackers.  For safe driving applications (e.g., context-aware
   navigation, cooperative adaptive cruise control, and platooning), as
   explained in Section 3.1, the cooperative action among vehicles is
   assumed.  Malicious nodes may disseminate wrong driving information
   (e.g., location, speed, and direction) for disturbing safe driving.
   For example, a Sybil attack, which tries to confuse a vehicle with
   multiple false identities, may disturb a vehicle from taking a safe
   maneuver.

   Even though vehicles can be authenticated with valid certificates by
   an authentication server in the vehicular cloud, the authenticated
   vehicles may harm other vehicles, so their communication activities
   need to be logged in either a central way through a logging server
   (e.g., TCC) in the vehicular cloud or a distributed way (e.g.,
   blockchain [Bitcoin]) along with other vehicles or infrastructure.
   For the non-repudiation of the harmful activities of malicious nodes,
   a blockchain technology can be used [Bitcoin].  Each message from a
   vehicle can be treated as a transaction and the neighboring vehicles
   can play the role of peers in a consensus method of a blockchain
   [Bitcoin][Vehicular-BlockChain].  For a blockchain's efficient
   consensus in vehicular networks having fast moving vehicles, a new
   consensus algorithm needs to be developed or an existing consensus
   algorithm needs to be enhanced.

   To identify malicious vehicles among vehicles, an authentication
   method is required.  A Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) and a user
   certificate (e.g., X.509 certificate [RFC5280]) along with an in-
   vehicle device's identifier generation can be used to efficiently
   authenticate a vehicle or its driver (having a user certificate)
   through a road infrastructure node (e.g., IP-RSU) connected to an
   authentication server in the vehicular cloud.  This authentication
   can be used to identify the vehicle that will communicate with an
   infrastructure node or another vehicle.  In the case where a vehicle
   has an internal network (called Moving Network) and elements in the
   network (e.g., in-vehicle devices and a user's mobile devices), as
   shown in Figure 3, the elements in the network need to be
   authenticated individually for safe authentication.  Also, Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) certificates [RFC8446][RFC5280] can be used for
   an element's authentication to allow secure E2E vehicular
   communications between an element in a vehicle and another element in
   a server in a vehicular cloud, or between an element in a vehicle and
   another element in another vehicle.

Internet-Draft          IPWAVE Problem Statement               July 2020


   For secure V2I communication, a secure channel (e.g., IPsec) between
   a mobile router (i.e., IP-OBU) in a vehicle and a fixed router (i.e.,
   IP-RSU) in an EN needs to be established, as shown in Figure 3
   [RFC4301][RFC4302][RFC4303][RFC4308][RFC7296].  Also, for secure V2V
   communication, a secure channel (e.g., IPsec) between a mobile router
   (i.e., IP-OBU) in a vehicle and a mobile router (i.e., IP-OBU) in
   another vehicle needs to be established, as shown in Figure 4.  For
   secure communication, an element in a vehicle (e.g., an in-vehicle
   device and a driver/passenger's mobile device) needs to establish a
   secure connection (e.g., TLS) with another element in another vehicle
   or another element in a vehicular cloud (e.g., a server).  Even
   though IEEE 1609.2 [WAVE-1609.2] specifies security services for
   applications and management messages.  This WAVE specification is
   optional, so if WAVE does not support the security of a WAVE frame,
   either the network layer or the transport layer needs to support
   security services for the WAVE frames.

   For the setup of a secure channel over IPsec or TLS, the multihop V2I
   communications over DSRC is required in a highway for the
   authentication by involving multiple intermediate vehicles as relay
   nodes toward an IP-RSU connected to an authentication server in the
   vehicular cloud.  The V2I communications over 5G V2X (or LTE V2X) is
   required to allow a vehicle to communicate directly with a gNodeB (or
   eNodeB) connected to an authentication server in the vehicular cloud.

   To prevent an adversary from tracking a vehicle with its MAC address
   or IPv6 address, especially for a long-living transport-layer session
   (e.g., voice call over IP and video streaming service), a MAC address
   pseudonym needs to be provided to each vehicle; that is, each vehicle
   periodically updates its MAC address and its IPv6 address needs to be
   updated accordingly by the MAC address change [RFC4086][RFC4941].
   Such an update of the MAC and IPv6 addresses should not interrupt the
   E2E communications between two vehicles (or between a vehicle and an
   IP-RSU) for a long-living transport-layer session.  However, if this
   pseudonym is performed without strong E2E confidentiality (using
   either IPsec or TLS), there will be no privacy benefit from changing
   MAC and IPv6 addresses, because an adversary can observe the change
   of the MAC and IPv6 addresses and track the vehicle with those
   addresses.  Thus, the MAC address pseudonym and the IPv6 address
   update should be performed with strong E2E confidentiality.

   For the IPv6 ND, the DAD is required to ensure the uniqueness of the
   IPv6 address of a vehicle's wireless interface.  This DAD can be used
   as a flooding attack that uses the DAD-related ND packets
   disseminated over the VANET or vehicular networks.  Thus, the
   vehicles and IP-RSUs need to filter out suspicious ND traffic in
   advance.

   For mobility management, a malicious vehicle can construct multiple
   virtual bogus vehicles, and register them with IP-RSUs and MA.  This
   registration makes the IP-RSUs and MA waste their resources.  The IP-
   RSUs and MA need to determine whether a vehicle is genuine or bogus
   in mobility management.  Also, the confidentiality of control packets
   and data packets among IP-RSUs and MA, the E2E paths (e.g., tunnels)
   need to be protected by secure communication channels.  In addition,
   to prevent bogus IP-RSUs and MA from interfering with the IPv6
   mobility of vehicles, mutual authentication among them needs to be
   performed by certificates (e.g., TLS certificate).
