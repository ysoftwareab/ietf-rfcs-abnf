              draft-ietf-bmwg-sdn-controller-benchmark-term-00 


Abstract 

   This document defines terminology for benchmarking an SDN 
   Controller's performance. The terms provided in this document help 
   to benchmark SDN controller's performance independent of the 
   controller's supported protocols and/or network services. A 
   mechanism for benchmarking the performance of SDN controllers is 
   defined in the companion methodology document. These two documents 
   provide a standard mechanism to measure and evaluate the performance 
   of various controller implementations.

1. Introduction 

   Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a networking architecture in 
   which network control is decoupled from the underlying forwarding 
   function and is placed in a centralized location called the SDN 
   controller. The SDN controller abstracts the underlying network and 
   offers a global view of the overall network to applications and 
   business logic. Thus, an SDN controller provides the flexibility to 
   program, control, and manage network behaviour dynamically through 
   standard interfaces. Since the network controls are logically 
   centralized, the need to benchmark the SDN controller performance 
   becomes significant. This document defines terms to benchmark 
   various controller designs for performance, scalability, reliability 
   and security, independent of northbound and southbound protocols.

2.3. Benchmarking Terms 

   This section defines metrics for benchmarking the SDN controller. 
   The procedure to perform the defined metrics is defined in the 
   accompanying methodology document. 

2.3.1. Performance

   To measure the time taken to discover the network topology - nodes 
   and links by a controller. 
    
Discussion: 
   Network topology discovery is key for the SDN controller to 
   provision and manage the network. So it is important to measure how 
   quickly the controller discovers the topology to learn the current 
   network state. This benchmark is obtained by presenting a network 
   topology (Tree, Mesh or Linear) with the given number of nodes to 
   the controller and wait for the discovery process to complete .It is 
   expected that the controller supports network discovery mechanism 
   and uses protocol messages for its discovery process.

2.3.1.2. Asynchronous Message Processing Time  

Definition: 
   To measure the time taken by the controller to process an 
   asynchronous message. 
    
Discussion: 
   For SDN to support dynamic network provisioning, it is important to 
   measure how quickly the controller responds to an event triggered 
   from the network. The event could be any notification messages 
   generated by an SDN node upon arrival of a new flow, link down etc. 
   This benchmark is obtained by sending asynchronous messages from 
   every connected SDN nodes one at a time for the defined test 
   duration. This test assumes that the controller will respond to the 
   received asynchronous message. 
    
Measurement Units: 
   milliseconds 
    
See Also: 
   None 

 
2.3.1.3. Asynchronous Message Processing Rate  

Definition: 
   To measure the maximum number of asynchronous messages that a 
   controller can process within the test duration. 
    
Discussion: 
   As SDN assures flexible network and agile provisioning, it is 
   important to measure how many network events that the controller can 
   handle at a time. This benchmark is obtained by sending asynchronous 
   messages from every connected SDN nodes at full connection capacity 
   for the given test duration. This test assumes that the controller 
   will respond to all the received asynchronous messages. 
    
Measurement Units: 
   Messages processed per second.

Definition: 
   The time taken by the controller to setup a path reactively between 
   source and destination node, expressed in milliseconds. 
    
Discussion: 
   As SDN supports agile provisioning, it is important to measure how 
   fast that the controller provisions an end-to-end flow in the 
   dataplane. The benchmark is obtained by sending traffic from a 
   source endpoint to the destination endpoint, finding the time 
   difference between the first and the last flow provisioning message 
   exchanged between the controller and the SDN nodes for the traffic 
   path.  
    
Measurement Units: 
   milliseconds. 
    
See Also: 
   None 

2.3.1.5. Proactive Path Provisioning Time 

Definition: 
   The time taken by the controller to setup a path proactively between 
   source and destination node, expressed in milliseconds. 
    
Discussion: 
   For SDN to support pre-provisioning of traffic path from 
   application, it is important to measure how fast that the controller 
   provisions an end-to-end flow in the dataplane. The benchmark is 
   obtained by provisioning a flow on controller's northbound interface 
   for the traffic to reach from a source to a destination endpoint, 
   finding the time difference between the first and the last flow 
   provisioning message exchanged between the controller and the SDN 
   nodes for the traffic path.

2.3.1.6. Reactive Path Provisioning Rate 

Definition: 
   Measure the maximum number of independent paths a controller can 
   concurrently establish between source and destination nodes 
   reactively within the test duration, expressed in paths per second. 
    
Discussion: 
   For SDN to support agile traffic forwarding, it is important to 
   measure how many end-to-end flows that the controller could setup in 
   the dataplane. This benchmark is obtained by sending traffic each 
   with unique source and destination pairs from the source SDN node 
   and determine the number of frames received at the destination SDN 
   node. 
    
Measurement Units: 
   Paths provisioned per second. 
    
See Also:

2.3.1.7. Proactive Path Provisioning Rate 

Definition: 
   Measure the maximum number of independent paths a controller can 
   concurrently establish between source and destination nodes 
   proactively within the test duration, expressed in paths per second. 
    
Discussion: 
   For SDN to support pre-provisioning of traffic path for a larger 
   network from the application, it is important to measure how many 
   end-to-end flows that the controller could setup in the dataplane. 
   This benchmark is obtained by sending traffic each with unique 
   source and destination pairs from the source SDN node. Program the 
   flows on controller's northbound interface for traffic to reach from 
   each of the unique source and destination pairs and determine the 
   number of frames received at the destination SDN node.

   The amount of time required for the controller to detect any changes 
   in the network topology. 
    
Discussion: 
   In order to for the controller to support fast network failure 
   recovery, it is critical to measure how fast the controller is able 
   to detect any network-state change events. This benchmark is 
   obtained by triggering a topology change event and measuring the 
   time controller takes to detect and initiate a topology re-discovery 
   process.

2.3.2. Scalability 

2.3.2.1. Control Sessions Capacity  

Definition: 
   To measure the maximum number of control sessions the controller  
   can maintain. 
    
Discussion: 
   Measuring the controller's control sessions capacity is important to 
   determine the controller's system and bandwidth resource 
   requirements. This benchmark is obtained by establishing control 
   session with the controller from each of the SDN node until it 
   fails. The number of sessions that were successfully established 
   will provide the Control Sessions Capacity.

   For optimal network planning, it is key to measure the maximum 
   network size that the controller can discover. This benchmark is 
   obtained by presenting an initial set of SDN nodes for discovery to 
   the controller. Based on the initial discovery, the number of SDN 
   nodes is increased or decreased to determine the maximum nodes that 
   the controller can discover.

2.3.2.3. Forwarding Table Capacity 

Definition: 
   The maximum number of flow entries that a controller can manage in 
   its Forwarding table. 
    
Discussion: 
   It is significant to measure the capacity of controller's Forwarding 
   Table to determine the number of flows that controller could forward 
   without flooding/dropping. This benchmark is obtained by 
   continuously presenting the controller with new flow entries through 
   reactive or proactive flow provisioning mode until the forwarding 
   table becomes full. The maximum number of nodes that the controller 
   can hold in its Forwarding Table will provide Forwarding Table 
   Capacity. 
    
Measurement Units: 
   Maximum number of flow entries managed.

2.3.3.2. Denial of Service Handling  

    
Definition: 
   To determine the effect of handling denial of service (DoS) attacks 
   on performance and scalability tests.  
    
Discussion: 
   This benchmark test is to be performed after obtaining the baseline 
   performance of the performance and scalability tests defined in 
   section 2.3.1 and section 2.3.1.. This benchmark determines the 
   deviation from the baseline performance due to the handling of 
   denial of service attacks on controller. 
    
Measurement Units: 
   Deviation of baseline metrics while handling Denial of Service 
   Attacks.

2.3.4. Reliability  

2.3.4.1. Controller Failover Time  

Definition: 
   The time taken to switch from an active controller to the backup 
   controller, when the controllers work in redundancy mode and the 
   active controller fails. 
    
Discussion: 
   This benchmark determine the impact of provisioning new flows when 
   controllers are teamed and the active controller fails. 
    
Measurement Units:

2.3.4.2. Network Re-Provisioning Time  

Definition: 
   The time taken to re-route the traffic by the Controller, when there 
   is a failure in existing traffic paths. 
    
Discussion: 
   This benchmark determines the controller's re-provisioning ability 
   upon network failures. This benchmark test assumes the following: 
               i. Network topology supports redundant path between 
                  source and destination endpoints.  
              ii. Controller does not pre-provision the redundant path. 
    
Measurement Units:
