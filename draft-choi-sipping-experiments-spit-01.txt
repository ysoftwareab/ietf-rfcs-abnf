Internet-Draft           Experiments on SPIT             November 2007 
    

Abstract 

   This document shows some experimental results on SPIT on commercial 
   VoIP services, in which a SIP UA has not been secured by SIP security
   protocol such as TLS. Although many service providers have been 
   applying the HTTP digest scheme to authenticate a SIP UA, they often 
   do not apply SIP signaling protection against potential threats 
   between the SIP UA and the SIP proxy. This cause vulnerabilities to 
   the VoIP services like SPIT. The aim of this memo is to inform the 
   service providers of SPIT threats by showing some experimental 
   results of SPIT on current VoIP networks.

1. Introduction 

   The SPIT (SPam over Internet Telephony) [2] can be classified into 
   two categories: the SPIT sent on path associated with SIP signaling 
   and off path. 

   The SPIT sent on path associated with SIP signaling means that a 
   spammer who registered the VoIP service sends the SPIT message. For 
   sending SPIT, spammers SHOULD register a VoIP service, and then could
   send a SPIT only through normal signaling routes. The studies on

Internet-Draft           Experiments on SPIT             November 2007 
    

   protecting this SPIT have been discussed in several drafts 
   [4][5][6][7][8] at the SIPPING WG. The SPIT on sip signaling route is
   out of the scope of this draft. 

   In case of the abnormal routes, a spammer who did not register to the
   VoIP services tries to send the SPIT message using replay attack, 
   dictionary attack, or sniffing. It is not easy for spammers to send 
   this SPIT if the security mechanisms specified in the SIP protocol 
   [3] are applied to all the signaling routes in SIP: among the UA, 
   proxy, registrar, and so on. In many cases, however, the TLS 
   mechanism is not applied between the SIP nodes, this SPIT still works
   between the UA and the SIP proxy or the SIP proxy servers. The 
   spammer can send SIP messages like INVITE or 200 OK directly to the 
   UA or the SIP proxy, and then communicate with the user by 
   establishing a media channel. 

   Currently, VoIP providers have been applying only the HTTP digest 
   scheme to authenticate a UA. They do not consider protecting SIP 
   signaling between the UA and the SIP proxy. On the commercial 
   networks where the TLS mechanism is not applied, some SPIT scenarios 
   were tested as follows.  

   - The SPIT between the UAC and the Outbound Proxy 
   - The SPIT between the Inbound Proxy and the UAS 
   - The SPIT between the Outbound Proxy and the Inbound Proxy 
   - The SPIT using Replay Attack 
   - The SPIT using Dictionary Attack 

   Although both the UA and the spammer belong to the same local area 
   network during experiments, it is possible for the spammer with 
   sophisticated spywares or monitoring tools to send a SPIT to the 
   remote users. 

   The goal of this document is to inform service providers of potential 
   SPIT threats by showing some experimental results on SPIT on current 
   VoIP networks so that they SHOULD carefully consider applying the TLS 
   mechanism to the SIP UA.

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1]. 


   Two terminologies are defined in this document. 

   A normal route in SPIT: The SPIT sent through a normal signaling 
   route by a spammer who registered the VoIP service. 

   An abnormal route in SPIT: The SPIT sent through an abnormal 
   signaling route by a spammer who did not register the VoIP service. 

    

3. Experiments on SPIT 

   The experiments are performed on the following networks. 

   - Three commercial VoIP providers 

   - Three commercial UAs and two open UAs 

   There is no TLS mechanism applied among the UAC, UAS, and Proxy 
   servers. Also, the UA and the spammer belong to the same LAN so that 
   the spammer can sniff SIP messages and send them directly to the UA.

Internet-Draft           Experiments on SPIT             November 2007 
    

3.1. The SPIT between the UAC and the Outbound Proxy 

   This experiment shows that the spammer sends a 200 OK response to the 
   UAC in complying with an INVITE message initiated by an UA as a call 
   request to the UAS. Figure 2 shows the message flow of our 
   experiment. When the spammer senses the INVITE message, he generates
   a 200 OK message, spoofs IP address of the proxy server, and then
   replies with the 200 OK message. Upon receiving the 200 OK message,
   the media channel might be established between the UAC and the
   spammer. As a result, the spammer could play out a recorded
   announcement or communicate with the UAS. In the experiment, this
   SPIT succeeded at all the tested UAs.

   This SPIT was possible because the spammer could easily sniff the 
   INVITE message. If the TLS mechanism is used between the UA and proxy
   server, this SPIT can be protected.

3.2. The SPIT between the Inbound Proxy and the UAS 

   This scenario that spammers can directly send SIP calls to the UAS 
   using P2P call signaling has been discussed on the draft [9]. This 
   document shows an experimental result using this scenario on 
   commercial VoIP networks. Figure 3 shows the message flow of our 
   experiment. To make a direct call, the spammer generates an INVITE 
   message and sends it to the UAS. The spammer needs to sniff the 200 
   OK message from the UAS. The 200 OK message includes the IP address 
   and port number for media session. Upon sniffing the 200 OK, the 
   spammer could play out a recorded announcement or communicate with 
   the UAS. In our test, this SPIT worked at all the UA's. 

   Also, the one-ring SPIT is tested. In this case, the spammer sends 
   only the INVITE message without sniffing the corresponding 200 OK 
   message. When the UAS receives the INVITE message, the phone is 
   ringing and the SIP URI is displayed at the user. The user who feels 
   curious about the name ID might make a return call to the caller. 
   Consequently, the spammer can make a successful talk with the callee.
   This SPIT also worked at all the UAs during our experiments.

  Figure 3 : The Message Flow of the SPIT between the Proxy and the UA 

    

   This SPIT was also possible because the TLS was not established 
   between the proxy server and the UAS. If the TLS was applied to the 
   UAS, the INVITE message sent by the spammer could be blocked during 
   the TLS process. Hence, the INVITE message could be dropped.

3.3. The SPIT between the Outbound Proxy and the Inbound Proxy 

   Without using the TLS between SIP servers, the spammer who 
   impersonates a legitimate outbound proxy server can send a SPIT 
   message via inbound proxy server of the UAS. This is similar to the 
   SPIT between the inbound proxy and UAS. Figure 4 shows the message 
   flow of our experiment. First of all, the spammer generates the 
   INVITE message including the information of the legitimate outbound 
   proxy server and the UAC, and then sends the message to the inbound 
   proxy. The inbound proxy server normally handles this message. After
   sending the INVITE message, the spammer performs the same procedure 
   as the section 3.2. As a result, the spammer could play out a 
   recorded announcement or communicate with the UAS. In the 
   experiment, this SPIT succeeded in the environment where the TLS
   is not applied between the proxy servers.

   This SPIT was also possible because the TLS was not established 
   between the proxy servers. If the TLS was applied to the proxy
   server, the spammer could not send the SIP messages.

3.4. The SPIT using Replay Attack 

   This SPIT is that the spammer tries to send a SPIT message using 
   replay attack after terminating the session between the UAC and UAS.
   Figure 5 shows the message flow of our experiment. For sending SPIT,
   the spammer should sniff the INVITE message including a credential. 
   The spammer sends the BYE message to the UAS to terminate the 
   established session. And then, the spammer tries to send the sniffed

       Figure 5 : The Message Flow of the SPIT Using Replay attack 

   This SPIT was possible because the TLS was not established between 
   the UAC and outbound proxy server, and the digest authentication 
   scheme was not applied to the BYE message. If the TLS or digest 
   scheme was applied to the UAC, the spammer could not send the SIP 
   messages.

3.5. The SPIT using Dictionary Attack 

   The spammer can send a SPIT message to the UA through normal routes 
   without revealing his position and privacy information. When the TLS
   is not used at the UA, the spammer can apply the dictionary attack 
   with credential value obtained by sniffing to guess the legitimate 
   password. If the attack is successful, the spammer can make a call 
   spam via normal routes in SIP network without disclosing any of his 
   information. 

   Anybody could easily sniff the REGISTER or INVITE messages on the 
   deployed VoIP networks. They could also guess the legitimate password
   of a UA using dictionary attack tools. For the reason, VoIP service 
   providers SHOULD apply the TLS mechanism between the UA and the SIP 
   server such as registrar and proxy server. 

    

4. Security Considerations 

   This document showed some experimental results on feasible SPIT 
   scenarios on commercial VoIP networks. Spammers might try to directly
   send SPIT to the UA or proxy server, on abnormal routes in SIP-based 
   networks. If the TLS mechanism is used among the UAC, proxy, 
   registrar, and UAS, these SPIT can be protected. The VoIP providers, 
   however, have not been applying the TLS mechanism at the UA or proxy 
   servers. Hence, the SPIT worked at all the commercial UAs during our 
   experiments. Although our experiments were performed at the situation
   that both commercial UA and spammer belong to the same local area 
   network, it is possible for the spammer to send a SPIT to a remote UA
   using spyware or hacking tools. 

     Therefore, it is necessary for service providers to apply strictly 
   the TLS mechanism to the UA and proxy server. If the TLS is used, it 
   is difficult for spammers who want to know information for 
   establishing media session to sniff the SIP messages. The 
   authentication value can be protected by the same reason. 

    

5. IANA Considerations 

   This document does not require actions by IANA.
