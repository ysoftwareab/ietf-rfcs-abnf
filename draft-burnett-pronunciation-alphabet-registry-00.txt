1.  Introduction

   The Pronunciation Alphabet Registry contains a list of Pronunciation
   Alphabet tags.  This allows implementers a straightforward and
   reliable way to validate Pronunciation Alphabet tags.  The
   Pronunciation Alphabet Registry will be maintained so that it is
   possible to validate all of the Pronunciation Alphabet tags under the
   provisions of this document or its revisions or successors.  In
   addition, the meaning of the various Pronunciation Alphabet tags will
   be unambiguous and stable over time.  (The meaning of private use
   Pronunciation Alphabet, of course, is not defined here.)

   Pronunciation Alphabet tags can be used in the alphabet attribute of
   the phoneme element in the Speech Synthesis Markup Language
   [W3C.CR-speech-synthesis11-20090827].  At some point in the future
   they may also be usable within the alphabet attribute of the phoneme
   and lexicon elements in the Pronunciation Lexicon Specification
   [W3C.REC-pronunciation-lexicon-20081014].


2.  Document Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Registry Format and Maintenance

3.1.  Format of the Pronunciation Alphabet Registry

   The Pronunciation Alphabet Registry (PAR) consists of a text file
   including all registered Pronunciation Alphabet tags in the format
   defined in this section, plus copies of the registration forms
   approved in accordance with the process described in Section 3.5.
   The set of initial tags (see Section 3.9.1.1) will not have
   registration forms created for them.

   The format of the registry is described by the following ABNF (per
   RFC5234 [RFC5234]):

    registry = file-date record-separator records

    record-separator = "%%" CRLF

    records = record *(record-separator record)

    record = (alphabet-record / alias-record)

Internet-Draft                     PAR                     December 2009


    kv-separator = *SP ":" *SP

    text = *(ASCCHAR/LWSP)

    ASCCHAR = %x21-25 / %x27-7E / UNICHAR

    UNICHAR = AMPERSAND "#x" 2*6HEXDIG ";"

    AMPERSAND = %x26

    date = 4DIGIT "-" 2DIGIT "-" 2DIGIT


    file-date = "File-Date" kv-separator date CRLF

    alphabet-record = alphabet-type tag 1*description added reference
                      [deprecated] *comments

    alias-record = alias-type tag *description added alias
                      [deprecated] *comments

    alphabet-type = type kv-separator "alphabet" CRLF

    alias-type = type kv-separator "alias" CRLF

    type = "Type"

    tag = "Tag" kv-separator tag-format CRLF

    description = "Description" kv-separator text CRLF

    added = "Added" kv-separator date CRLF

    reference = "Reference" kv-separator text CRLF

    alias = "Alias" kv-separator tag-format CRLF

    deprecated = "Deprecated" kv-separator date CRLF

    comments = "Comments" kv-separator text CRLF

                      Figure 1: Registry Format ABNF

   This format was based on the language tags format described in
   [RFC5646].

   Each line of text is limited to 72 characters, including all
   whitespace.  Records are separated by lines containing only the

   sequence "%%" (%x25.25).

   Each field can be viewed as a single, logical line of ASCII
   characters, comprising a field-name and a field-body separated by a
   COLON character (%x3A).  For convenience, a field-body allowing text
   can be split into a multiple-line representation; this is called
   "folding".

   Characters from outside the US-ASCII ISO646 [ISO.646.1991]
   repertoire, as well as the AMPERSAND character ("&", %x26) when it
   occurs in field body text, are represented by a "Numeric Character
   Reference" using hexadecimal notation in the style used by XML 1.0
   [W3C.REC-xml-20081126] (see
   <http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#dt-charref>).  This consists of the
   sequence "&#x" (%x26.23.78) followed by a hexadecimal representation
   of the character's code point in ISO 10646 followed by a closing
   semicolon (%x3B).  For example, the EURO SIGN, U+20AC, would be
   represented by the sequence "&#x20AC;".  Note that the hexadecimal
   notation MAY have between two and six digits.

   All fields whose field-body contains a date value use the "full-date"
   format specified in [RFC3339].  For example: "2004-06-28" represents
   June 28, 2004, in the Gregorian calendar.

   The first record in the file contains the single field whose field-
   name is "File-Date".  The field-body of this record contains the last
   modification date of this copy of the registry, making it possible to
   compare different versions of the registry.  The registry on the IANA
   (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) website is the most current.
   Versions with an older date than that one are not up-to-date.

    File-Date: 2004-06-28
    %%

                 Figure 2: Example of the File-Date Record

   Subsequent records represent tags in the registry.  Each of the
   fields in each record MUST occur no more than once, unless otherwise
   noted below.  Each record MUST contain the following fields unless
   otherwise noted:

   Type
                  Type's field-value MUST consist of one of the strings
                  "alphabet" or "alias", denoting the type of tag.

   Tag
                  Tag's field-value contains a Pronunciation Alphabet
                  tag.
   Description
                  Description's field-value contains a non-normative
                  description of the tag.  This field MUST appear in
                  records whose 'Type' is "alphabet" and MAY appear in
                  records whose 'Type' is "alias".
   Reference to published description of the pronunciation alphabet
                  This field-value contains normative information that
                  identifies a reference defining the Pronunciation
                  Alphabet associated with this tag, for example a
                  national standard, an association's standard, a book,
                  or an article.  It is strongly RECOMMENDED that this
                  reference be published, public, and stable.  This
                  field MUST appear in records whose 'Type' is
                  "alphabet" and MUST NOT appear in records whose 'Type'
                  is "alias".
   Alias
                  Alias' field-value MUST be another registered
                  Pronunciation Alphabet tag whose 'Type' is "alphabet".
                  This field MUST appear in records whose 'Type' is
                  "alias" and MUST NOT appear in records whose 'Type' is
                  "alphabet".
   Added
                  Added's field-value contains the date the record was
                  added to the registry.

   The 'Tag' field MUST use lowercase letters to form the tag.

   The field 'Description' MAY appear more than one time and contains a
   description of the tag in the record.  At least one of the
   'Description' fields MUST be written or transcribed into the Latin
   script; the same or additional fields MAY also include a description
   in a non-Latin script.

   Note: The purpose of the "Reference to published description of the
   pronunciation alphabet" in the record is intended as an aid to people
   trying to verify whether a pronunciation alphabet is registered.  The
   contents of this field SHOULD reference a published standard; if no
   such standard exists, other well known works describing that
   pronunciation alphabet MAY be provided instead.  The Pronunciation
   Alphabet Tag Reviewer decides what constitutes "good enough"
   reference material.

   The field 'Alias' contains a mapping between the record in which it
   appears and another tag.

Internet-Draft                     PAR                     December 2009


   A tag which is defined as an alias must always remain an alias,
   although the value of the Alias field may change.

   Each record MAY also contain the following fields:

   Deprecated
                  Deprecated's field-value contains the date the record
                  was deprecated.
   Comments
                  Comments contains additional information about the
                  tag, as deemed appropriate for understanding the
                  registry and implementing the associated Pronunciation
                  Alphabet tag.

   The field 'Deprecated' MAY be added to any record via the maintenance
   process described in Section 3.3or via the registration process
   described in Section 3.5.  Usually, the addition of a 'Deprecated'
   field is due to the action on the mailing list.  Although valid as
   Pronunciation Alphabet tags, tags with a 'Deprecated' field are
   deprecated and document authors SHOULD NOT use these tags.

   The field 'Comments' MAY appear more than once per record.  This
   field MAY be inserted or changed via the registration process and no
   guarantee of stability is provided.  The content of this field is not
   restricted, except by the need to register the information, the
   suitability of the request, and by reasonable practical size
   limitations.

   The values for fields 'Tag' and 'Alias' MUST use the following
   syntax:

    tag-format = 2ALPHA *5(["."] 1*20(ALPHA / DIGIT))

3.2.  Pronunciation Alphabet Reviewer

   The Pronunciation Alphabet Reviewer moderates the <ietf-par@iana.org>
   mailing list, responds to requests for registration, and performs the
   other registry maintenance duties described in Section 3.3.  Except
   as described there, only the Pronunciation Alphabet Reviewer is
   permitted to request IANA to change, update, or add records to the
   Pronunciation Alphabet Registry.  The Pronunciation Alphabet Reviewer
   MAY delegate list moderation and other clerical duties as needed.

   The Pronunciation Alphabet Reviewer is appointed by the IESG for an
   indefinite term, subject to removal or replacement at the IESG's
   discretion.  The IESG will solicit nominees for the position (upon
   adoption of this document or upon a vacancy) and then solicit
   feedback on the nominees' qualifications.  Qualified candidates
   should be familiar with this document and its requirements; be
   willing to fairly, responsively, and judiciously administer the
   registration process; and be suitably informed about the issues of
   pronunciation alphabets so that the reviewer can assess the claims
   and draw upon the contributions of experts in the use and definition
   of pronunciation alphabets and tag requesters.

   The subsequent performance or decisions of the Pronunciation Alphabet
   Reviewer MAY be appealed to the IESG under the same rules as other
   IETF decisions (see RFC2026 [RFC2026]).  The IESG can reverse or
   overturn the decisions of the Pronunciation Alphabet Reviewer,
   provide guidance, or take other appropriate actions.

3.3.  Maintenance of the Registry

   The Pronunciation Alphabet Reviewer MUST evaluate each suggested
   change, determine whether it conflicts with existing registry
   entries, and submit the information to IANA for inclusion in the
   registry.  If a suggestion is submitted and the Pronunciation
   Alphabet Reviewer does not do this in a timely manner, then any
   interested party MAY use the procedure in Section 3.5 to register the
   appropriate update.

   The Pronunciation Alphabet Reviewer MUST ensure that new tags meet
   the requirements in Section 3.5.  When either a change or addition to
   the registry is needed, the Pronunciation Alphabet Reviewer MUST
   prepare the complete record, including all fields, and forward it to
   IANA for insertion into the registry.  Each record being modified or
   inserted MUST be forwarded in a separate message.

   If a record represents a new tag that does not currently exist in the
   registry, then the message's subject line MUST include the word
   "INSERT".  If the record represents a change to an existing tag, then

Internet-Draft                     PAR                     December 2009


   the subject line of the message MUST include the word "MODIFY".

   The message MUST contain both the record for the tag being inserted
   or modified and the new File-Date record.  Here is an example of what
   the body of the message might contain:

  From:  par_reviewer@example.com
  To:  <<IANA>>
  CC:  <ietf-par@iana.org>
  Subject:  PRONUNCIATION ALPHABET TAG INSERT

  Reference to published description of the pronunciation alphabet:  Any
  young child's word book.
  Comments: This is a comment shown as an example.
  %%

     Figure 5: Example of a Pronunciation Alphabet Tag Insertion Form

   Whenever an entry is created or modified in the registry, the 'File-
   Date' record at the start of the registry is updated to reflect the
   most recent modification date in the [RFC3339] "full-date" format.
   Before forwarding a new registration to IANA, the Pronunciation
   Alphabet Reviewer MUST ensure that values in the record are valid
   according to the description in Section 3.1.

3.4.  Stability of Pronunciation Alphabet Registry Entries

   The stability of entries and their meaning in the registry is
   critical to the long term stability of pronunciation alphabet tags.
   Once registered, a tag will not be removed from the registry and will
   remain a valid way in which to specify a specific pronunciation
   alphabet or variant.  The rules in this section guarantee that a
   specific pronunciation alphabet tag's meaning is stable over time and
   will not change.

   While corrections to mistakes in the registry MAY be undertaken from
   time to time, attempts to provide translations or transcriptions of
   entries in the registry itself will probably be frowned upon by the
   community or rejected outright.

   Assignments to the Pronunciation Alphabet Registry MUST follow the
   following stability rules:

Internet-Draft                     PAR                     December 2009


   1.  Values in the fields 'Type', 'Tag', 'Added', and 'Deprecated'
       MUST NOT be changed and are guaranteed to be stable over time.
   2.  Values in the 'Description' and 'Reference to published
       description of the pronunciation alphabet' fields MUST NOT be
       changed in a way that would invalidate previously-existing tags.
       They MAY be broadened somewhat in scope, changed to add
       information, or adapted to the most common modern usage.
   3.  The field 'Comments' MAY be added, changed, modified, or removed
       via the registration process or any of the processes or
       considerations described in this section.
   4.  The field 'Alias' MAY be modified via the registration process or
       any of the processes or considerations described in this section.

3.5.  Registration Procedure for Pronunciation Alphabet Tag

   The procedure given here MUST be used by anyone who wants to use a
   tag not currently in the Pronunciation Alphabet Registry.

   This procedure MAY also be used to register or alter the information
   in a tag's record as described in Section 3.4.

   Registering a new tag or requesting modifications to an existing tag
   starts with the requester submitting an email containing a filled out
   registration form (reproduced below) to the email address
   <ietf-par@iana.org> for a 90 day review period before it can be
   submitted to IANA.  This is an open list and can be joined by sending
   a request to <ietf-par-request@iana.org>.  Note that emails are not
   limited in size so that the request can adequately describe the
   registration.

   PRONUNCIATION ALPHABET TAG REGISTRATION FORM
   1. Name of requester:
   2. E-mail address of requester:
   3. Record Requested:  <record as defined in Section 3.1>
   4. Any other relevant information:

          Figure 6: Pronunciation Alphabet Tag Registration Form

   When the 90 day period has passed the Pronunciation Alphabet Reviewer
   either forwards the record to be inserted or modified to IANA, with a
   CC to <ietf-par@iana.org>, according to the procedure described in
   Section 3.3, or rejects the request because of significant objections
   raised on the list or due to problems with constraints in this
   document (which MUST be explicitly cited).  The Pronunciation
   Alphabet Reviewer MAY also extend the review period in 90 day
   increments to permit further discussion.  The Pronunciation Alphabet
   Reviewer MUST indicate on the list whether the registration has been
   accepted, rejected, or extended following each 90 day period.

   Note that the Pronunciation Alphabet Reviewer MAY raise objections on
   the list if he or she so desires.  The important thing is that the
   objection MUST be made publicly.

   The applicant is free to modify a rejected application with
   additional information and submit it again; this restarts the 90 day
   comment period.

   Individuals who disagree strongly with a decision SHOULD register
   with the Pronunciation Alphabet Reviewer any Formal Objections.  When
   individuals believe that their concerns are not being duly considered
   by the group, they MAY ask the IESG to confirm or deny the decision.
   The Pronunciation Alphabet Reviewer MUST inform the IESG when a group
   participant has raised concerns about due process.  Any requests to
   the IESG to confirm a decision MUST include a summary of the issue
   (whether technical or procedural), decision, and rationale for the
   objection.  All counter-arguments, rationales, and decisions MUST be
   recorded.  It is RECOMMENDED that all such communications include a
   CC to <ietf-par@iana.org>.  The IESG can reverse or overturn the
   decision of the Pronunciation Alphabet Reviewer, provide guidance, or
   take other appropriate actions.

   Updates or changes to existing records follow the same procedure as
   new registrations.  The Pronunciation Alphabet Reviewer decides
   whether there is consensus to update the registration following the
   90 day review period; normally objections by the original registrant
   will carry extra weight in forming such a consensus.

3.6.  Initialization of the Registries

   Upon adoption of this document an initial version of the
   Pronunciation Alphabet Registry is necessary.  The initial
   Pronunciation Alphabet Registry contains the initial set of valid
   tags.  This collection of tags is described in Section 3.6.1.

   IANA SHALL publish the initial version of the registry described by
   this document from the content of Section 3.6.1.  Once published by
   IANA, the maintenance procedures, rules and registration processes
   described in this document will be available for new registrations or
   updates.

Request for pinyin2001
   1. Name of requester: Zhiwei Shuang
   2. E-mail address of requester: shuangzw@cn.ibm.com
   3. Record Requested:
 Type : alphabet
 Tag: pinyin2001
 Description: Chinese Mandarin Pronunciation Alphabet
 Reference to published description of the pronunciation alphabet:
 "Standard for the Scheme of Chinese Pronunciation Alphabet Input with
 Universal Keyboard" (China GF 3006-2001) published by Chinese
 government in 2001.  A Chinese language version is available in the

   Request for pinyin
      1. Name of requester: Zhiwei Shuang
      2. E-mail address of requester: shuangzw@cn.ibm.com
      3. Record Requested:
    Type :  alias
    Tag: pinyin
    Alias: pinyin2001

3.7.  Choice of Pronunciation Alphabet Tags

   One is sometimes faced with the choice between several possible
   pronunciation alphabets for the same tag.  It is strongly RECOMMENDED
   that the most widely accepted and used pronunciation alphabet is
   chosen for the specific tag.  Pronunciation alphabets that refer to
   published national or association standards are preferred.

   Interoperability is best served when all users use the same
   pronunciation alphabet tag in order to represent the same
   pronunciation alphabet.  If one pronunciation alphabet is registered
   with one tag, it MUST NOT be registered with other tags.  The only
   exception to this is the use of Alias.

3.8.  Security Considerations

   Although the specification of registry entries MUST be available over
   the Internet, implementations SHOULD NOT mechanically depend on it

   being always accessible, to prevent denial-of-service attacks.

   An SSML application can fail if someone hijacks and changes an alias
   value to something a processor does not support (if the processor
   relies on checking the alias value mechanically).

   An SSML application can fail if someone hijacks and changes an alias
   value to an earlier version of an alphabet which the processor
   supports but which may have different alphabet characters supported
   (if the processor relies on checking the alias value mechanically).

3.9.  IANA Considerations

3.9.1.  New registries

   This section describes the name spaces (registries) for PAR that IANA
   is requested to create and maintain.  Assignment/registration
   policies are described in RFC5226 [RFC5226].

3.9.1.1.  Pronunciation Alphabets

   IANA SHALL create a new name space of "Pronunciation Alphabets".  All
   maintenance within and additions to the contents of this name space
   MUST be according to Section 3.  The initial contents of the
   registry, defined in Section 3.6.1, are given below:
