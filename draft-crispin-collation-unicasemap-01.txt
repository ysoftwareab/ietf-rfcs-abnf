Abstract

     This document describes "i;unicode-casemap", a simple
     case-insensitive collation for Unicode strings.  It provides
     equality, substring and ordering operations.


Introduction

     The "i;ascii-casemap" collation described in [COMPARATOR] is quite
     simple to implement and provides case-independent comparisons for the
     26 Latin alphabetics.  It is specified as the default and/or baseline
     comparator in some application protocols, e.g., [IMAP-SORT].

     It is possible, with a modest extension, to provide a more
     sophisticated collation with greater multilingual applicability than
     "i;ascii-casemap".

     This collation, "i;unicode-casemap", is intended to be an alternative
     to, and preferred over, "i;ascii-casemap".  It does not replace the
     "i;basic" collation described in [BASIC].


1. Unicode Casemap Collation Description

     The "i;unicode-casemap" collation is a simple collation which
     operates on [UTF-8] strings and treats characters case-insensitively.
     It provides equality, substring and ordering operations.  All input
     is valid.

     As this collation is specific to UTF-8 strings, strings in other
     character sets and/or encodings can not be used with this collation
     unless they are first converted to UTF-8.

     For the equality and ordering operations, each input UTF-8 string is
     prepared by converting it to "titlecased canonicalized UTF-8" as
     follows on a per-character basis:

        (1) If the codepoint has a titlecase property in UnicodeData.txt
            (this is normally the same as the uppercase property) the
            codepoint is converted to the titlecased codepoint.
        (2) If the codepoint has a decomposition property of any type in
            UnicodeData.txt the codepoint is converted to the decomposed
            codepoints (effectively Normalization Form KD).
        (3) The resulting codepoint(s) is/are appended to the titlecased
            canonicalized UTF-8 string.

     The resulting two titlecased canonicalized UTF-8 strings are then
     treated as in i;octet for equality and ordering.

     Care should be taken when using OS-supplied functions to implement
     this collation as it is not locale sensitive.  Functions such as
     strcasecmp and toupper are sometimes locale sensitive and may
     inconsistently casemap letters.

     The i;unicode-casemap collation is well suited to to use with many
     Internet protocols and computer languages.  Use with natural language
     is often inappropriate; even though the collation apparently supports
     languages such as Swahili and English, in real-world use it tends to
     mis-sort a number of types of string:

     o  people and place names containing scripts that are not collated
        according to "alphabetical order".
     o  words with characters that have diacriticals.  However,
        i;unicode-casemap generally does a better job than i;ascii-casemap
        for most (but not all) languages.  For example, German umlaut
        letters will sort correctly, but some Scandinavian letters will
        not.
     o  names such as "Lloyd" (which in Welsh sorts after "Lyon", unlike
        in English),
     o  strings containing other non-letter symbols; e.g., euro and pound
        sterling symbols, quotation marks other than '"', dashes/hyphens,
        etc.

2. Unicode Casemap Collation Registration

     <?xml version='1.0'?>
     <!DOCTYPE collation SYSTEM 'collationreg.dtd'>
     <collation rfc="XXXX" scope="local" intendedUse="common">
       <identifier>i;unicode-casemap</identifier>
       <title>Unicode Casemap</title>
       <operations>equality order substring</operations>
       <specification>RFC XXXX</specification>
       <owner>IETF</owner>
       <submitter>mrc@cac.washington.edu</submitter>
     </collation>

3. Security Considerations

     Collations will normally be used with UTF-8 strings.  Thus the
     security considerations for [UTF-8], [STRINGPREP] and
     [UNICODE-SECURITY] also apply and are normative to this
     specification.


4. IANA Considerations

     The i;unicode-casemap collation should be added to the registry of
     collations defined in [COMPARATOR]
