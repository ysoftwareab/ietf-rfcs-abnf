     Signaling RPKI Validation Results from a Route-Server to Peers
               draft-kklf-sidr-route-server-rpki-light-00

Abstract

   This document defines the usage of the BGP Prefix Origin Validation
   State Extended Community [I-D.ietf-sidr-origin-validation-signaling]
   to signal RPKI validation results from a route-server to its peers.
   Upon reception of RPKI validation results peers can use this
   information in their local routing decision process.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to
   be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] only when they appear in all
   upper case.  They may also appear in lower or mixed case as English
   words, without normative meaning.

1.  Introduction

   RPKI-based route origin validation [RFC6480] can be a significant
   operational burden for BGP peers to implement and adopt.  In order to
   boost acceptance and usage of RPKI and ultimately increase the
   security of the Internet routing system, IXPs may provide RPKI-based
   route origin validation at the route-server
   [I-D.ietf-idr-ix-bgp-route-server].  The result of this route origin
   validation is signaled to peers by using the BGP Prefix Origin
   Validation State Extended Community as introduced in
   [I-D.ietf-sidr-origin-validation-signaling].

   Peers receiving the route origin validation result from the route-
   server(s) can use this information in their local routing decision
   process for acceptance, rejection, preference, or other traffic
   engineering purposes of a particular route.

2.  Signaling RPKI Validation Results from a Route-Server to Peers

   The BGP Prefix Origin Validation State Extended Community (as defined
   in [I-D.ietf-sidr-origin-validation-signaling]) is utilized for
   signaling RPKI validation result from a route-server to peers.

   [I-D.ietf-sidr-origin-validation-signaling] proposes an encoding of
   the RPKI validation result [RFC6811] as follows:

                           +-------+-----------+
                           | Value | Meaning   |
                           +-------+-----------+
                           |   0   | Valid     |
                           |   1   | Not found |
                           |   2   | Invalid   |
                           +-------+-----------+

                                  Table 1

   This encoding is re-used.  Route-servers providing RPKI-based route
   origin validation set the validation state according to the RPKI
   validation result (see [I-D.ietf-sidr-rpki-validation-reconsidered]).

3.  Operational Recommendations

3.1.  Local Routing Decision Process

   A peer receiving an RPKI validation result from the route server MAY
   use the information in its own local routing decision process.  The
   local routing decision process SHOULD apply to the rules as described
   in section 5 [RFC6811].

   A peer receiving an RPKI validation result from the route server MAY
   redistribute this information within its own AS.

3.2.  Route-Server Receiving the BGP Prefix Origin Validation State
      Extended Community

   An IXP route-server receiving routes from its peers containing the
   BGP Prefix Origin Validation State Extended Community MUST remove the
   extended community before the route is re-distributed to its peers.
   This is required regardless of whether the route-server is executing
   RPKI origin validation or not.

   Failure to do so would allow opportunistic peers to advertise routes
   tagged with arbitrary RPKI validation results via a route-server,
   influencing maliciously the decision process of other route-server
   peers.

3.3.  Error Handling at Peers

   A route sent by a route-server SHOULD only contain none or one BGP
   Prefix Origin Validation State Extended Community.

   A peer receiving a route from a route-server containing more than one
   BGP Prefix Origin Validation State Extended Community SHOULD only
   consider the largest value (as described in Table 1) in the
   validation result field and disregard the other values.  Values
   larger than two in the validation result field MUST be disregarded.

4.  IANA Considerations

   None.

5.  Security Considerations

   A route-server could be misused to spread malicious RPKI validation
   results.  However, peers have to trust the route-server anyway as it
   collects and redistributes BGP routing information to other peers.

   The introduction of a mechanisms described in this document does not
   pose a new class of attack vectors to the relationship between route-
   servers and peers.
