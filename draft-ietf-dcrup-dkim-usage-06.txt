          Cryptographic Algorithm and Key Usage Update to DKIM
                     draft-ietf-dcrup-dkim-usage-06

Abstract

   The cryptographic algorithm and key size requirements included when
   DKIM was designed in the last decade are functionally obsolete and in
   need of immediate revision.  This document updates DKIM requirements
   to those minimaly suitable for operation with currently specified
   algorithms.

1.  Discussion Venue

   RFC EDITOR: Please remove this section before publication.

   Discussion about this draft is directed to the dcrup@ietf.org [1]
   mailing list.

2.  Introduction

   DKIM [RFC6376] signs e-mail messages, by creating hashes of the
   message headers and content and signing the header hash with a
   digital signature.  Message recipients fetch the signature
   verification key from the DNS where it is stored in a TXT record.

   The defining documents specify a single signing algorithm, RSA
   [RFC8017], and recommends key sizes of 1024 to 2048 bits (but require
   verification of 512 bit keys).  As discussed in US-CERT VU#268267
   [VULNOTE], the operational community has recognized that shorter keys
   compromise the effectiveness of DKIM.  While 1024 bit signatures are
   common, stronger signatures are not.  Widely used DNS configuration
   software places a practical limit on key sizes, because the software
   only handles a single 256 octet string in a TXT record, and RSA keys
   significantly longer than 1024 bits don't fit in 256 octets.

   Due to the recognized weakness of the sha1 hash algorithm, see
   [RFC6194], and the wide availability of the sha256 hash algorithm (it
   has been a required part of DKIM [RFC6376] since it was originally
   standardized in 2007), the sha1 hash algorithm MUST NOT be used.

   This is being done now to allow the operational community time to
   fully shift to sha256 in advance of any sha1 related crisis.

3.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
   "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

4.  DKIM Signing and Verification Algorithms

   Section 4.1 updates [RFC6376] Section 3.3.

   Section 4.2 updates [RFC6376] Section 3.3.3.

   The algorithm described in[RFC6376] Section 3.3.1 is now historic and
   no longer used by DKIM.

   [RFC6376] Sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.4 are not affected.

4.1.  DKIM Signing and Verification Algorithms

   DKIM supports multiple digital signature algorithms.  Two algorithms
   are defined by this specification at this time: rsa-sha1 and rsa-
   sha256.  Signers MUST sign using rsa-sha256.  Verifiers MUST be able
   to verify using rsa-sha256.  rsa-sha1 MUST NOT be used for signing or
   verifying.

   DKIM signatures identified as having been signed with historic
   algorithms (currently rsa-sha1) have permanently failed evaluation as
   discussed in [RFC6376] Section 3.9.

4.2.  Key Sizes

   Selecting appropriate key sizes is a trade-off between cost,
   performance, and risk.  Since short RSA keys more easily succumb to
   off-line attacks, Signers MUST use RSA keys of at least 1024 bits for
   all keys.  Signers SHOULD use RSA keys of at least 2048 bits.
   Verifiers MUST be able to validate signatures with keys ranging from
   1024 bits to 4096 bits, and they MAY be able to validate signatures
   with larger keys.  Verifier policies can use the length of the
   signing key as one metric for determining whether a signature is
   acceptable.  Verifiers MUST NOT consider signatures using RSA keys of
   less than 1024 bits as valid signatures.

Internet-Draft          DKIM Crypto Usage Update           November 2017


   DKIM signatures with insufficient key sizes (currently rsa-sha256
   with less than 1024 bits) have permanently failed evaluation as
   discussed in [RFC6376] Section 3.9.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not change the Security Considerations of
   [RFC6376].  It reduces the risk of signature compromise due to weak
   cryptography.  The SHA-1 risks discussed in [RFC6194] Section 3 are
   resolved due to rsa-sha1 no longer being used by DKIM.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update the "sha1" registration in the "DKIM Hash
   Algorithms" as follows:

                      +------+-----------+----------+
                      | TYPE | REFERENCE | STATUS   |
                      +------+-----------+----------+
                      | sha1 | [RFC6376] | historic |
                      +------+-----------+----------+
