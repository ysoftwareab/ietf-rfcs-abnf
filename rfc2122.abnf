   This syntax: - allows the user to specify the remote host address by
     its name or numeric address. Although he could select a specific
     port, it is expected the information providers and VEMMI software
     will mostly use the port number assigned to VEMMI (575) [13]. For
     security reasons, the username and password could not be specified
     in the URL.
   - allows him to select a specific VEMMI service if the remote host
     manages several different VEMMI services.
   - allows also to send additional data to the service using the
     parameter syntax, either during the service selection phase or when
     the user selects a vemmi hyperlink within a HTML document displayed
     in a VEMMI multimedia area. To the difference of the params syntax
     used in [4], the parameter syntax requires each value to be labeled
     by an attribute. The parameter attribute names are case-
     insensitive. Parameter values may or may not be case-sensitive,
     depending on the attribute.

   All the values of fieldname beginning by a dollar ($) sign are
   reserved for specific use, including:
   - $COMMAND: VEMMI command to be returned to the host when the VEMMI
     session do not use a continuous link.
   - $CONTEXTDATA: context data.
   - $OBJECT_REQUEST: requests the retransmission of a given VEMMI object.
   - $USERDATA: user data specific by the user and to be processed by the
     VEMMI service.
