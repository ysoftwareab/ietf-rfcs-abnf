           IETF Network Slice for 5G and its characteristics
                  draft-rokui-5g-ietf-network-slice-00

Abstract

   5G Network slicing is an approach to provide separate independent
   end-to-end logical network from User Equipment (UE) to various mobile
   applications where each network slice has its own Service Level
   Agreement (SLA) and Objectives (SLO) requirements.  Each end-to-end
   network slice consists of a multitude of contexts across RAN, Core
   and transport domains each with its own controller.  To provide
   automation, assurance and optimization of the 5G the network slices,
   a 5G E2E network slice orchestrator is needed which interacts with
   controllers in RAN, Core and Transport network domains.  The
   interfaces between the 5G E2E network slice orchestrator and RAN and
   Core controllers are defined in various 3GPP technical
   specifications.  However, 3GPP has not defined a similar interface
   for transport network.

   The aim of this document is to describe E2E network slicing and its
   relation to "IETF network slice" for 5G use-case.  It also provides
   an information model for control and mangement of IETF network slices
   for 5G.

1.  Introduction

   Network slicing offers network operators a mechanism to allocate
   dedicated infrastructure, resources and services from a shared
   operator's network to a customer for specific use-case.  As discussed
   in draft [I-D.nsdt-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition], there are a
   number of use-cases benefiting from network slicing including:

   o  5G network slicing (See [TS.23.501-3GPP])

   o  Network wholesale services

   o  Network sharing among operators

   o  NFV connectivity and Data Center Interconnect

   It is important to note that the concept of network slicing is not
   only limited to 5G but other use-cases can also benefit from it as
   shown above.  However, the 5G use case is one of the important use
   cases for network slicing.  This memo will discuss the 5G use-case in
   more details.  In specific, 5G network slicing is a mechanism which a
   mobile network operator can use to allocate dedicated
   infrastructures, resources and services from a shared mobile and
   transport network to a 5G customer for specific 5G use-case.

   A 5G network slice is inherently an E2E concept and is composed of
   multiple logical independent networks in a common operator's network
   from a user equipment to various 5G applications.  In particular, 5G
   network slicing receives attention due to factors such as diversity
   of services and devices in 5G each with its own SLA requirements.
   Each 5G E2E network slice consists of multiple 5G RAN, 5G Core and
   transport network domains each with its own controller (See
   [TS.28.531-3GPP].

   To enable automation, assurance and optimization of 5G network
   slices, an E2E network slice orchestrator is needed which interacts
   with 5G RAN, 5G Core and Transport network controllers.  The
   interfaces between the E2E network slice orchestrator and RAN and
   Core slice controllers are defined in various 3GPP technical
   specifications.  However, 3GPP has not defined the same interface
   towards the transport network.  Draft
   [I-D.wd-teas-transport-slice-yang] addresses the object model of such
   interface for all network slice use-cases.  However, for 5G network

   slicing, the current model shall be augmented to address the specific
   characteristics of the 5G network slices.  The aim of this document
   is to provide characteristics of 5G network slices and how it relares
   to "IETF network slice".  It also provides the IETF network slice
   interface specifications and its information model to be used for
   automation, monitoring and optimization of IETF network slices for
   5G.  See [I-D.contreras-teas-slice-nbi].

1.1.  Definition of Terms

   Please refer to [I-D.nsdt-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition] and
   [I-D.homma-slice-provision-models] as well.

   Tenant:  Also known as Customer.  A network slice tenant is a person
      or group that rents and occupies an instance of the network slice
      from network provider.

   5G End-to-end Network Slice:  A logical end-to-end network provided
      by a 5G network slice provider that has the functionality and
      performance to support a specific 5G service.  It spans multiple
      network domains (e.g. radio, transport and core) and in some cases
      more than one administrative domain.  It may well support dynamic
      modification or it might be long-lasting i.e. only change on
      commercial timescales.

   5G IETF Network Slice:  We will use the term "5G IETF network slice"
      throughout this draft.  It simply refers to IETF network slice
      define in [I-D.nsdt-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition] applicable
      to 5G.

   RAN Slice:  Also known in 3GPP as RAN Sub-Slice or RAN Slice-Subnet.
      The context and personality created on RAN network functions to
      address the 5G radio portion of a 5G E2E network slice.

   Core Slice:  Also known in 3GPP as Core Sub-Slice or Core Slice-
      Subnet.  The context and personality created on Core network
      functions to address the 5G Core portion of a 5G E2E network
      slice.

      IoT sensor and etc.

   RAN:  Radio Access Network is the part of a mobile system that
      connects individual devices to other parts of a network through
      radio connections.  It provides connection between user equipment
      (UE) and mobile core network.

   Transport Domain:  Transport domain is a network domain implemented
      by the deployment of IETF network technologies.

2.  Architecture of a 5G end-to-end network slice

   To demonstrate the concept of 5G E2E network slice and the role of
   various controllers, consider a typical 5G network shown in Figure 1
   where a mobile network operator Y has two customers C1 and C2.  The
   boundaries of administrative domain of the operator includes RAN,
   transport, Core and mobile application domains.  Customer C1 and C2
   request to have one or more logical independent E2E networks from UEs
   (e.g. vehicle infotainment, mobile phone, IoT meters etc.) to the 5G
   application servers, each with its own distinct SLO.

   Each of these independent networks is called a 5G E2E network slice.
   Each E2E network slice comprised of three componets RAN slice, IETF
   network slice, and Core slice, respectively representing RAN,
   transport and core domain portions of the slice.

    Figure 1: High level architecture of a 5G end-to-end network slice

   In Figure 1 mobile network operator Y has created four 5G E2E network
   slices, NS1, NS2, NS3 and NS4, each with its own RAN, Core and IETF
   network slices.  To create a RAN slice, the RAN network function s
   such as eNB and gNB should be programmed to have a context for each
   5G E2E network slice.  This context means that the RAN network
   functions should allocate certain resources for each 5G E2E network
   slice they belong to such as air interface, various schedulers,
   policies and profiles to guarantee the SLO requirement for that
   specific network slice.  By the same token, the Core slices will be
   created which means that the mobile network operator will create the
   context for each 5G E2E network slice on Core network functions.

   For each 5G E2E network slice NS1, NS2, NS3 and NS4, after creation
   of RAN and Core slices, they should be connected to each other and be
   connected to mobile application servers to form the 5G E2E network
   slice.  As defined in [I-D.nsdt-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition],
   the set of connections are referred to "IETF Network Slices" and
   specifically for 5G they are referred to "5G IETF Network Slices".

Internet-Draft        draft-rokui-5G-network-slice         November 2020


   Referring to Figure 1, for each 5G E2E network slice, the following
   5G IETF network Slices are needed:

   o  5G IETF Network Slice 1: To connect RAN slice to Core slice in
      Transport Network 1

   o  5G IETF Network Slice 2: To connect Core slice to Mobile
      Application Servers in Transport Network 2.  This might be needed
      if the mobile application servers are connected to core network
      functions through a transport network.  For example, if the Core
      slice, which is realized on VNFs, and mobile application servers
      are in the same data center, the 5G IETF Network Slice 2 is not
      needed.  In this case the transport network 2 does not exist.

   Note that as we will see later in Section 4.1, Section 4.2 and
   Section 4.3, the number of "5G IETF network slices" might be more
   than two which depends on some factors such as RAN deployment:

   After creation of RAN, Core and 5G IETF network slices, they will be
   associated together to form a working 5G E2E network slice identified
   by an ID referred as to S-NSSAI.  Please refer to [TS.23.501-3GPP]
   for more info on S-NSSAI.

   To support fully automated enablement and assurance of 5G E2E network
   slices, multiple controllers are needed to perform the life cycle of
   5G E2E network slices in RAN, Core and Transport domains.  As shown
   in Figure 2 each RAN, Core and Transport domain needs its own
   controller called RAN Slice Controller, Core Slice Controller and
   IETF Network Slice Controller.  In addition, an E2E network slice
   orchestrator is needed to provide coordination and control of network
   slices from an E2E perspective.

   In summary, a 5G E2E network slice will involve several domains, each
   with its own controller; 5G RAN, 5G Core and transport domains need
   to be coordinated in order to deliver an E2E mobile service.  Note
   that in this context a service is not an IP/MPLS service but rather
   customer facing services such as CCTV service, eMBB service,
   Infotainment service and so on.

       Figure 2: Various controllers for 5G end-to-end network slice

3.  Typical flow for fulfillment of a 5G E2E network slice

   Figure 3 provides a typical flow across various controllers,
   orchestrator, NFVO and RAN/Transport/Core networks to achieve the
   automatic creation of a 5G E2E network slices such as NS1, NS2, NS3
   or NS4 shown in Figure 1.  Below are typical steps from the time a
   customer sends its request for a 5G E2E network slice creation to the
   operators network until the network slice is created and ready to be
   used by the customer.  It is important to note that in practice some
   of these steps can be combined or re-ordered.

   1.   The customer C1 requests, from operator Y, the creation of a 5G
        E2E network slice NS1 for Infotainment service type and SLO of
        10 [Mbps]

   2.   The 5G E2E network slice orchestrator receives this request and
        using its pre-defined network slice blueprints (a.k.a. network
        slice templates), creates a network slice profile (a.k.a.
        network slice instance) containing all the network functions in
        RAN and core which should be part of this E2E network slice.  It
        then goes through decomposition of this profile and triggers
        various actions towards RAN, Core and transport domains.

   3.   A request for creation of 5G RAN slice will be sent to RAN Slice
        Controller.

   4.   If new instances of virtual RAN network functions are needed,
        the RAN Slice Controller triggers the creation of new VNFs in
        RAN (using for example ETSI interface Os-Ma-nfvo)

   5.   NFVO manages the life cycle of virtual RAN network functions

   6.   Since both physical and virtual RAN network functions which are
        part of 5G E2E network functions are known to the RAN slice
        controller, it triggers the creation of a RAN slice by
        programming 5G RAN network functions

   7.   Similary to previous step (3), a request for creation of a Core
        slice will be sent to the Core Slice Controller.

   8.   If new instances of virtual Core network functions are needed,
        the Core Slice controller triggers the creation of new 5G core
        VNFs (using for example ETSI interface Os-Ma-nfvo) and NFVO
        manages the life cycle of virtual Core network functions

   9.   Since both physical and virtual 5G Core network functions as
        components of 5G E2E network functions are known to the Core
        slice controller, it triggers the creation of Core slice by
        programming 5G Core network functions

   10.  In this step, the creation of various 5G IETF network slices
        will be triggered.  Each 5G IETF network slice contains one or
        more connections between RAN network functions, Core network
        functions and 5G mobile applications.  For example, connectivity
        between 5G RAN and 5G Core slices, connectivity between 5G RAN
        network functions (such as DU to CU) or connectivity between 5G
        core slice and mobile applications.  Note that this step can be
        triggered by E2E network slice orchestrator, RAN slice
        controller, Core slice controller, or a combination of them.

   11.  [Optional] If the realization of a 5G IETF network slice
        involves creation of new VNFs (e.g.  Firewall, security gateway
        etc.), 5G IETF network slice controller triggers the creation of
        those VNFs (using for example ETSI interface Os-Ma-nfvo)

   12.  Various 5G IETF network slices will be realized in transport
        network.  Note that interface (10) is technology-agnostic
        whereas interface (12) is technology-specific

   13.  The E2E network slice orchestrator associates RAN slice, Core
        slice and 5G IETF network slices together to form a single 5G
        E2E network slice NS1

Internet-Draft        draft-rokui-5G-network-slice         November 2020


   14.  At the end, when the E2E network slice is created, the E2E
        network slice orchestrator will allocate a unique network slice
        id (called S-NSSAI) and eventually, during the UE network
        attach, UEs will be informed about the existence of this newly
        created E2E network slice.  UEs can request it using the 3GPP 5G
        signaling procedures.

   Note that the interfaces 3 and 7 between 5G E2E network slice
   orchestrator and RAN and Core slice controllers along with their
   information models are defined in various 3GPP technical
   specifications.  However, 3GPP has not defined the same interface for
   transport network (i.e. interface 10).

   The aim of this document is to define specific attributes related to
   5G network slices which will be used later to augment
   [I-D.wd-teas-transport-slice-yang].

4.  Definition of 5G IETF Network Slice

   Referring to [I-D.nsdt-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition], the IETF
   network slice is define as follows:

   An IETF network slice is a logical network topology connecting a
   number of endpoints with a set of shared or dedicated network
   resources.  These resources are used to satisfy specific Service
   Level Objectives (SLOs).

   The 5G IETF Network slice specification is technology-agnostic.
   Using the above-mentioned definition, the 5G IETF network slice is
   define as follows:

   5G IETF network slices are sets of connections among the following
   network functions and mobile applications:

   o  5G RAN slice and 5G Core slice

   o  5G Core slice and mobile application server

   o  Among 5G RAN network functions DU to CU

   o  Among 5G RAN network functions RU to DU

   In Section 4.1, Section 4.2 and Section 4.3, the details of various
   5G IETF network slices for following RAN deployment will be provided:

   o  Distributed RAN

   o  Centralized RAN

   o  Cloud RAN (C-RAN)

4.1.  5G IETF Network Slices in Distributed RAN deployment

   Distributed RAN is the most common deployment of 4G and 5G RAN
   networks whereas shown in Figure 4, the RAN network is connected to
   Core network using the transport network 1.  Optionally the mobile
   applications can be also connected to the Core network using another
   transport network 2.

   In this case, a single 5G E2E network slice contains not only 5G RAN
   and 5G Core slices but two 5G IETF network slices INS_1 and INS_2.
   INS_1 connects the RAN slice to Core slice and INS_2 connects Core
   slice to mobile application servers (if needed).

4.2.  5G IETF Network Slices in Centralized RAN deployment

   The RAN consists of two functional units: the baseband unit (BBU) and
   the radio unit (RU).  The BBU processes the signal and is connected
   to the transport network.  The RU transmits and receives the carrier
   signal that is transmitted over the air to the end user equipment
   (UE).  In Centralized RAN as depicted in Figure 5, the RU and BBU are
   separated by a network called fronthaul network.

   In this deployment a single 5G E2E network slice contains not only 5G
   RAN and 5G Core slices but three 5G IETF network slices INS_1, INS_2
   and INS_3 where INS_1 and INS_2 are identical to their counterparts
   in distributed RAN deployment case (see Figure 4) and a new INS_3
   connects the Radio Units (RU) to the BBUs.

4.3.  5G IETF Network Slices in Cloud RAN (C-RAN)

   In Cloud-RAN deployment, the baseband unit (BBU) is further
   disaggregated into real-time and non-real-time components.  The
   former is deployed close to antenna to manages the real-time air
   interface resources while the non-real-time control functions are

   hosted centrally in the cloud.  In 5G, BBU is split into two parts
   called CU (Central Unit) and DU (Distributed Unit) as shown in
   Figure 6 where these entities are connected by a new network called
   Midhaul network.

   In this deployment a single 5G E2E network slice contains not only 5G
   RAN and 5G Core slices but four 5G IETF network slices INS_1, INS_2,
   INS_3 and INS_4 where INS_1, INS_2 and INS_3 are identical to their
   counterparts in centralized RAN deployment case (see Figure 5) and a
   new 5G IETF network slice INS_4 connects the DUs to CUs.

4.4.  5G IETF Network Slice as a set of Connection Groups

   As discussed in [I-D.nsdt-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition], an
   IETF network slice contains one or more connections between various
   network functions, application and devices.  These connections can be
   grouped into various Connection Groups where each group has its own
   SLA/SLO.





Rokui, et al.              Expires May 6, 2021                 [Page 14]

Internet-Draft        draft-rokui-5G-network-slice         November 2020


   To further explore this concept in 5G E2E network slicing, consider
   Figure 7, where the details of 5G IETF network slice INS_1 introduced
   in Figure 4 is illustrated.  The 5G IETF network slice INS_1 is
   between 5G RAN and Core slices and has multiple connections between
   5G RAN network functions BBU1 and BBU2 and 5G Core network functions
   AMF1 and UPF1.  In particular, it contains the following connection
   groups, each with its own SLO where SLO-C and SLO-U might be
   different (e.g. they might be control and user plans SLOs):

   o  "Connection group C" connects BBU1 and BBU2 to AMF1 with SLO-C

   o  "Connection group U" connects BBU1 and BBU2 to UPF1 with SLO-U

   The combination of two connection groups will form the 5G IETF
   network slice INS_1.  Note that the definition of 5G IETF network
   slice INS_1 does not specify how these connections should be realized
   in transport network 1.  Although it is optionally possible, it is
   not necessarily mandatory for the definition of a 5G IETF network
   slice to state which technology (e.g.  IP, MPLS, Optics, PON etc.) or
   tunnel type (e.g.  RSVP-TE, SR-TE etc.) should be employed for
   realization.  As discussed in
   [[I-D.nsdt-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition], any of these
   technologies may be used by the IETF Network Slice Controller (NSC)
   to realize an IETF network slice.

   In summary, a 5G IETF network slice is a distinct set of technology-
   agnostic connection groups between various 5G network functions, 5G
   devices or 5G applications each with its own deterministic SLO which
   can be realized by any suitable technology, tunnel type and service
   type.

5.  IETF Network Slice Controller NBI for 5G

   As discussed in [I-D.nsdt-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition] and
   [I-D.nsdt-teas-ns-framework], to fulfill (i.e. create, modify,
   delete) any IETF network slice and perform monitoring on it, an
   entity called IETF Network Slice Controller (NSC) is required to take
   abstract requests for 5G IETF network slices and realize them using
   suitable underlying technologies.  An IETF Network Slice Controller
   is the key building block for control and management of the transport

   slice.  It provides the creation/modification/deletion, monitoring
   and optimization of transport Slices in a multi-domain, a multi-
   technology and multi-vendor environment.

   Figure 8 shows the NSC and its NBI interface for 5G.  Draft
   [I-D.wd-teas-transport-slice-yang] addresses the base data model of
   the NSC NBI interface for all network slicing use-cases.  However,
   for 5G network slicing, the current model shall be augmented to
   include the specific characteristics of the 5G network slices for
   this interface.  The details of NSC NBI interface for 5G provided in
   Section 6.

   technologies that can be used on SBI including physical connections,

   Optics, any IETF models can be used during the realization of IETF
   network slice.

   There are no specific mapping requirements for 5G.  The only
   difference is that in case of 5G, the NBI interface contains
   additional 5G specific attributes such as customer name, mobile
   service type, 5G E2E network slice ID (i.e.  S-NSSAI) and so on (See
   Section 6).  These 5G specific attributes can be employed by IETF
   Network Slice Controller during the realization of 5G IETF network
   slices on how to map NBI to SBI.  They can also be used for assurance
   of 5G IETF network slices.  Figure 9 shows the mapping between NBI to
   SBI for 5G IETF network slices.

6.  5G IETF Network Slice NBI Information Model

   Based on the definition of 5G IETF Network slices (see Section 4),
   the high-level information model of northbound interface of IETF
   Network Slice Controller (NSC) for 5G IETF network slices should
   conform with Figure 10:

   Figure 10: Information model of NSC NBI interface for 5G IETF Network
                                  Slices

   The proposed information model should include the following building
   blocks:

   o  5g-ietf-network-slice-info: All attributes related to 5G IETF
      Network Slice.  It contains information such as 5G IETF network
      slice name, 5G IETF network slice ID, PLMN and hierarchical tenant
      ID etc.

   o  5g-network-slice-info: A list of all E2E network slices mapped to
      this 5G IETF network slice.  As discussed in Section 3, a request
      for creation of a 5G IETF network slice is sent from 5G E2E
      network slice orchestrator to IETF Network Slice Controller (NSC)
      for a customer and certain service type (e.g.  CCTV, Infotainment,
      URLLC, etc.).  It is NSC's decision to either create a new
      transport slice or use one of the existing ones.  As a result, the
      mapping between 5G E2E network slice and IETF network slice is
      many to one, i.e. one 5G IETF network slice can be used with
      multiple 5G E2E network slices.  The attributes of each 5G E2E
      network slices are included here.  The 5g-network-slice-info
      contains the list of E2E network slices which are mapped to a 5G
      IETF network slice with all relevant attributes such as S-NSSAI,
      customer name and service type.

   o  5g-connection-group: A 5G IETF network slice contains one or more
      connection groups each with its own SLA/SLO.  Each connection
      group contains:

      *  connection-group-attributes: A list of attributes for each 5g-
         connection-group such as connection-group-id, connection-group-
         name and connection-group-status

      *  connection-group-member: A list of members.  Each member is a
         connection between two endpoints.  A connection group can
         contain one or more members.  For example, the connections
         BBU1-UPF1 and BBU2-UPF1 are 2 members of "connection group U"
         in Figure 7.

      *  connection-group-slo-policy: This is a mandatory policy.  The
         connection-group-slo-policy represents in a generic and
         technology-agnostics fashion the SLO requirement needed to
         realize members of a connection group.  It contains SLOs such

Internet-Draft        draft-rokui-5G-network-slice         November 2020


         as bounded latency, bandwidth, reliability, security etc.  Note
         that all members of a connection group must have the same SLO.

      *  connection-group-realization-policy: This is an optional
         policy.  In some scenarios, the 5G E2E network slice
         orchestrator might be able to influence the IETF Network Slice
         Controller on how to realize a 5G IETF network slice by
         providing some technology-specific information.

      *  connection-group-monitoring-policy: This is an optional policy.
         The 5G E2E network slice orchestrator can influence the IETF
         Network Slice Controller on how to perform monitoring,
         analytics and optimization on 5G IETF Network Slices.  It
         contains, the type of assurance needed, time interval,
         frequency of how often to inform the 5G E2E Network Slice
         Orchestrator etc.

   o  5g-ietf-network-slice-endpoint: It contains the list of all
      endpoints along with their attributes which belong to a 5G IETF
      network slice.  See Figure 11

   o  5G-ietf-connection-group-member: It contains the list of all
      members of connectin groups along with their attributes which
      belong to a 5G IETF network slice.
