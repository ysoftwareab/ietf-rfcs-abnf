Abstract

   Documents in the RFC series normally use only plain-text ASCII
   characters and a fixed-width font.  However, there is sometimes a
   need to supplement the ASCII text with graphics or picture images.
   The historic solution to this requirement, allowing secondary PDF and
   Postscript files, is seldom used because it is awkward for authors
   and publisher.  This memo suggests a more convenient scheme for
   attaching authoritative diagrams, illustrations, or other graphics to
   RFCs.  It further proposes conventions for additional input and

   display formats, to improve readability.  This proposal is based on
   draft-rfc-image-files-00, by Braden and Klensin, and revises it as
   little as possible, while expanding the goals of the effort.

1.  Introduction

   Published documents in the RFC series normally use only plain-text
   ASCII characters and a fixed-width font [RFC2223].  This simple
   convention has the advantage of a stable encoding for which a wide
   variety of tools are readily available for viewing, searching,
   editing, etc.

   Inclusion of diagrams, state machines, and other graphics in RFC text
   has generally relied on the imaginative use of ASCII characters
   ("ASCII artwork".)  However, in a few cases over the years, ASCII
   artwork has been inadequate for images needed or desired in RFCs.
   The old solution to this dilemma has been to allow three versions of
   an RFC: a primary ASCII version and secondary versions that are
   encoded using PDF and Postscript.  The PDF and Postscript versions
   are "complete", containing a copy of the text as well as the full
   images [RFC2223].  The textual content and layout of the PDF/PS
   version is required to match the base version as closely as possible.
   However, the ASCII text version is considered the official expression
   of the RFC, and it is always normative for standards track documents.
   We will refer to this old approach as ".txt+.pdf+.ps" encoding.

   The three versions of an RFC using .txt+.pdf+.ps encoding are in
   separate files in the primary RFC repository
   (http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/"), with suffixes ".txt", ".pdf", and
   ".ps".  The RFC Editor search engine returns links to all three
   versions when they are present in the repository.

   Unfortunately, the .txt+.pdf+.ps scheme has been awkward for both
   editor and author, and it is error-prone, so it has seldom been used
   (roughly 50 out of 5000+ RFCs).  The problem is that, in general,
   only the author has the tools to prepare the PDF and Postscript
   versions.  The RFC Editor edits (only) the primary text version, and
   then the author must incorporate all the resulting changes into the
   PDF/PS version while maintaining the "look" of the RFC to the extent
   possible.  There is no practical way for the RFC Editor to verify
   that this is done correctly, perhaps leading to editorial errors and
   usually lengthening publication time for these documents.

   This memo suggests a much better scheme, for including figures,
   illustrations, and graphics to an RFC, as well as for maintaining a
   single copy of base text which can be turned into multiple
   presentation forms.  We hope that the method proposed here will solve
   the image problem for RFC publication, although the .txt+.pdf+.ps
   approach would still be possible (and in any case, RFCs using the
   historic scheme will continue to exist in the RFC repository
   forever).

   This proposal is based on draft-rfc-image-files-00, by Braden and
   Klensin, and revises it as little as possible.  As an expedient, the
   References section has been omitted from this initial version of the
   draft.

1.1.  Goals

   The list of goals in the current proposal expands upon the ones of
   the draft-rfc-image-files-00 proposal:

   1.   There is a single, master file for document text.

   2.   Base text is able to be edited, viewed, compared and searched
        with extremely minimal set of tools, such as a classic text
        editors, and the like.

   3.   The master file is subject to formatting constraints, to improve
        readability when using simple display tools.

   4.   All formats use strictly open standards.

   5.   Any mapping from the master file to a presentation format must
        only depend upon well-tested, reliable tools that are available
        as open-source.

   6.   Multiple display forms must be supported, notably scroll-form
        for screen display and paginated form for printing, as well as
        classic, basic IETF ASCII paginated format.

   7.   Figures can be encoded in classic ASCII art and/or in a graphics
        format.

   8.   Enhanced display formats can support basic font changes, within
        IETF-defined criteria, since this can enhance readability.

   9.   Naming conventions tightly link additional files that are used
        by the master file.

   10.  Changes seek to have as much automation as possible for the
        technical aspects of RFC development and production.

   11.  Format for the master file should facilitate later revision
        efforts.

2.  A New Scheme for Representation

   Under our scheme, an RFC may be either a single ASCII file as
   commonly used today, or a composite of multiple files: an ASCII-only
   "base file" containing the text of the RFC, and one or more "image
   files".  The ASCII file may optionally conform to xml2rfc format.
   When present, the image file would be a {{standard image} file that
   contains only images, captions, and title information.  The base file
   may contain classic "ASCII art" and refer to external image files as
   alternatives.  An RFC which is displayed in any form other than
   simple ASCII would then be a logical entity whose complete, or
   preferred, representation could require multiple files, base and
   image(s).

   The base file may be formatted exactly like current ASCII RFCs, with
   three minor exceptions described below.  Alternatively, it may be
   formatted using xml2rfc.  The xml2rfc convention is well-established
   within the IETF and RFC community.  It permits having a single,
   textual document base, which can easily produce .txt+.pdf+.html
   formats.  In addition, it can contain a text-only version of art,
   while using external image files, when available and appropriate to
   the output form.

   The intellectual property boilerplate in the base file ("Rights in
   Contributions BCP 78, RFC 4748 [RFC4748] ) would apply equally to the
   image file.  An image file would contain one or more items that will
   be known collectively as "figures", whether they are actually
   diagrams, pictures, tables, artwork, or other non-textual
   constructions.

   This scheme was inspired by the tradition in book publishing, where
   pictures, figures, or "plates" may be grouped together following the
   text ("end figures"), or even bound separately from the main body of
   the text.

   In principle, we could allow an image file to be encoded using both
   PDF and Postscript, since mechanical translation is possible in both
   directions.  However, in the 20 years since the adoption of the .txt+
   .pdf+.ps scheme, the PDF format has become a de facto standard for
   electronic documents, and readers for it are universally available.
   Furthermore, PDF is being standardized as a format for document
   archiving, as discussed further in the next section.  Therefore, we
   propose to allow only PDF for image files, simplifying the new
   approach by not including a Postscript file option.

   An ASCII RFC traditionally uses a file name in the form of
   "rfcN.txt", where N is integer RFC number without leading zeros.  The
   image file that is associated with RFC number N could be named

Internet-Draft             EMail Architecture                August 2008


   "rfcN.{image name}.{image format extension}".  As noted earlier, the
   repository already contains RFCs with file names "rfcN.ps" and
   "rfcN.pdf", using the historic .txt+.pdf+.ps scheme.


3.  Construction of the Image File

   Each image would be in a single {image format} file, containing only
   that image and consistent with the description in [RFC3778] and
   defined in [ISO32000-1].  The particular {image format} form must be
   version-stable and must not contain any external references in
   scripts or otherwise.  The RFC Editor authorizes the set of {image
   formats} that are permitted for use.

   There is an issue of whether particular generators of {image format}
   that claim to satisfy {image format standards} actually do so.
   Future experience may require published guidelines on PDF-generating
   software that claims to satisfy {image format}{image format} but does
   not.

   Except as otherwise specified in this document, an image file should
   contain only a single figure, supporting labels and captions,
   headers, and footers.  It should not contain explanatory text or
   other materials that could reasonably be expressed in plain-text form
   in the base file

   For xml2rfc output that produces .html or .pdf, images are produced
   inline and are consecutively numbered.

   For .txt output, pages of the image files would be consecutively
   numbered.  The first page number of the image file would follow the
   last page number of the base RFC, exclusive of the number of the end-
   of-RFC boilerplate page.  The page number of the end-of-RFC
   boilerplate (in the base RFC file) would be the first page number
   after those in the image file.  Each page of the image file would
   contain the same headers and footers as the base file, except for one
   change in the footer, suggested below.

   Figures included in the image file would have to be labeled in a
   fashion that facilitated referencing from the base RFC.  They may be
   numeric and monotonic or it may use textual image names.  Simple
   consecutive integer will usually be the best choice, but in some
   cases it might be desirable to use a hierarchical scheme like:
   <section #>.<fig #>.  An author who believes that another labeling
   scheme would increase clarity should check with the RFC Editor.

4.  Requirements for the Base File

4.1.  Overview

   A base file would be unchanged by the presence of an image file,
   except for the following.

   o  For .txt format, the page number of the end-of-RFC boilerplate
      page would be changed to be logically one page after the last
      image file page.

   o  A new unnumbered "Figures" section would be required.  This is
      described below.

   o  For a composite RFC, a minor modification to the first-page header
      of the base file and to the footers of both base and image files
      could tie the additional files together.  This is described below.

4.2.  Figures Section

   An RFC that used this scheme (and had any figures) would need to
   include a Figures section in the ASCII base file.  The Figures
   section should immediately following the Table of Contents, if any,
   and precede the body of the document.  The Figures section should
   list all figures in tabular form, indicating for each one the figure
   identification, title, and page number(s).

   The style for the Figures section has not yet been fully specified.
   Here is a suggested example.

   __________________________________________________________________

   An RFC that includes a base file may include ASCII artwork that is
   suggestive of a figure in the image file, but there is no requirement
   to do so.  When such an approximate figure appears as ASCII artwork
   in the base file, its figure identification and caption must match
   those of the corresponding figure in the image file, and the entry in
   the Figures table should specify the page numbers in both the base
   and image file, In the example shown above, image file page numbers
   are marked with an asterisk.  Note that very simple ASCII artwork
   need not appear in the image file.

4.3.  Formatting Changes

   It would be necessary to tie the base and image files together, to
   make clear they are part of one RFC.  Here is an initial suggestion
   for formatting, which needs further consideration before it is
   adopted.

   The header line "Request for Comments: nnnn" in the base file could
   be changed to "Request for Comments: nnnn/Base".  For consistency,
   the lefthand footer could become "RFC nnnn/Base".  The lefthand
   footer in the image file could then be: "RFC nnnn/ {Image Name}.

Internet-Draft             EMail Architecture                August 2008


   The following sentence could be placed in the "Status of this Memo"
   section: "This RFC is a composite of this base file and {image
   format} image files."


5.  Submission and Processing of the Image File

   If a image files are needed, they should be submitted as a .{image
   name>.{image format} files along with the ASCII text file.  The image
   files should be submitted without headers or footers.  The RFC Editor
   will overlay the image file with the appropriate headers and footers,
   with correct pagination.  The RFC Editor will not normally do any
   editing of the image file beyond this.  If editing the base file
   reveals problems with figures in the image file, the authors will be
   asked to create a new image file.


6.  Implementation Issues

   This scheme has a number of implications.

   1.  The Internet Draft repository must allow submission and retrieval
       of both base and (when present) image files.

   2.  Internet Draft file names could be draft-...-vv.txt and
       (optionally) draft-...-vv.{image name}.{image format}, where "vv"
       is the normal version number.  Updating any file of the composite
       RFC should increase the version numbers "vv" in both files.  We
       DO NOT want two separate version numbers for one I-D

   3.  The RFC Editor would need to be able to overlay headers, footers,
       and page numbers on a given image file.  It is claimed that at
       least Adobe Acrobat Professional includes this capability, and
       that it also has limited editing capability.

   4.  The RFC Editor would also need a tool to verify that a given
       image file satisfies the constraints of {image format}.{image
       format}.

   5.  Some RFC Editor scripts and tools would need small extensions.

   6.  xml2rfc already supports external image files, as an adjunct to,
       or replacement of, textual art and is used when available, for
       .html and .pdf formats..

7.  RFC Repository File Formats

   A frequent reaction to the suggestion given in this memo is some
   confusion over the different file formats that appear in the RFC
   repository.  Here is a brief summary.

   If a {image format} image file exists along with a base ASCII RFC,
   then RFCs in any other format (e.g., complete {image format} files,
   HTML, or Postscript) remain supplemental, with the reader taking
   responsibility for assuring that they are equivalent to the base RFC
   and image file.  That arrangement is identical to the relationship
   between traditional all-ASCII RFCs and supplemental forms: the RFC
   Editor has never taken responsibility for guaranteeing that the two
   are identical in content.

   The existing .txt.pdf files are not affected by this proposal.  The
   .txt.pdf files are facsimiles of .txt (base files) in PDF, introduced
   to help Windows users read RFCs online.  However, Microsoft has more
   recently provided an elementary ASCII editor, which probably makes
   the .txt.pdf files unnecessary in any case.

   In summary:

   o  .txt: ASCII-only file.  In old scheme, complete normative file.
      In new scheme, text part of composite RFC, or stand-alone text
      file.

   o  .ps: Old scheme -- a Postscript file that includes figures and
      whose text is intended to be the same as the normative .txt file.

   o  .pdf: Old scheme -- a PDF file that includes figures and whose
      text is intended to be the same as the normative .txt file.

   o  .{image name}.{image format}: New scheme: image file(s) part of a
      composite with .txt or xml2rfc file.

   o  .txt.pdf: Old scheme: Facsimile of corresponding .txt file.

   We note that it would be possible to combine the base and image files
   into a single PDF file, which would have to follow a naming
   convention to distinguish it from the .pdf case listed above.


8.  Internationalization Considerations

   Our scheme of image files does not, and is not intended to, support
   character set internationalization for RFCs.  It does not allow an
   author to omit the ASCII text from the base file and instead include



Crocker                 Expires February 28, 2009              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft             EMail Architecture                August 2008


   the entire RFC text as one (very large) image file.

   However, we should note two special cases.

   1.  RFC 3743 [RFC3743] on internationalized domain names for Chinese,
       Japanese,, and Korean contains a number of examples that may be
       hard to follow because they can represent those characters only
       in "U+nnnn" form.  An image file could be used that would show
       the alternative Chinese characters for the examples.  This would
       not diminish either the ability to search the base text or index
       the document or its readability for those of us for whom reading
       Chinese characters is difficult, but it should help those who can
       read them.

   2.  Suppose that a proposed RFC contained a section derived from
       Japanese text.  The author might put an English translation into
       that section of the base document, note that the original was
       really in Japanese, and attach the Japanese as an appendix in an
       image file.  This should raise no difficulties for informative
       documents.  For normative documents, however, the existence of
       the Japanese original would raise some issues about what was
       actually authoritative, which is very undesirable.


9.  Security Considerations

   This specifications addresses documentation standards and adding
   additional flexibility to them.  It does not, in general, raise any
   security issues.  However, unless the specifications of this document
   are carefully followed, the image format recommended, {image format},
   may potentially contain external references or scripts that could
   introduce security problems.  The RFC Editor and other publishers
   should exercise due care to ensure that no such references or scripts
   appear in the archives.


10.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no actions by the IANA.
