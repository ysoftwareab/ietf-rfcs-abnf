 Transferring MIB Work from IETF Ethernet Interfaces and Hub MIB WG to
                             IEEE 802.3 WG
                 draft-ietf-opsawg-mibs-to-ieee80231-01

Abstract

   This document records the transfer of responsibility for the
   Ethernet-related MIB modules DOT3-OAM-MIB, SNMP-REPEATER-MIB, POWER-
   ETHERNET-MIB, DOT3-EPON-MIB, EtherLike-MIB, EFM-CU-MIB, ETHER-WIS and
   MAU-MIB from the IETF to the IEEE 802.3 Working Group.  This document
   also describes the procedures associated with the transfer, in a
   similar way as RFC 4663 which records the transfer of the IETF Bridge
   MIB work to the IEEE 802.1 Working Group.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC4663], published in September, 2006, described a plan for
   transferring responsibility for four MIB modules related to bridges
   from the IETF to IEEE 802.1.  Some years later, responsibility for
   eight more MIB modules was transferred from the IETF Ethernet
   Interfaces and Hub MIB (hubmib) Working Group to the IEEE 802.3
   Working Group.  The MIB modules concerned are tabulated below
   (Section 2).  [RFC4663] clearly enunciates the motivation for both
   transfers and also provides an introduction to IEEE standardization
   procedures.  The discussions of those topics will not be repeated
   here.

   The IEEE version of this second lot of transferred MIB modules was
   published as 802.3.1-2011 in February, 2011.  The IEEE 802.3.1
   specification was subsequently updated.  The latest version, IEEE
   802.3.1-2013 [IEEE802.3.1-2013], is the basis for this document.

2.  IETF and Corresponding IEEE 802.3 MIB modules

   This section tabulates the MIB modules that were transferred to IEEE
   802.3, identifying the IETF source document, the corresponding clause
   of [IEEE802.3.1-2013], and the location of the MIB itself in ASCII
   format.

3.  Procedural Aspects Of the Transfer

3.1.  IEEE MIB Modules in ASCII Format

   The content of Section 2.2 of [RFC4663] is accurate also for this
   document.

3.2.  OID Registration for New MIB Modules

   The IEEE 802.3 WG adopted the approach recommended in [RFC4663],
   Section 2.3 of developing an IEEE MIB module and defining new
   compliance clauses under the IEEE OID branch.  Information about the
   IEEE 802.3 Management Registration Arcs can be found at
   http://www.ieee802.org/3/arcs/index.html.

3.3.  Mailing List Discussions

   The Ethernet Interfaces and Hub MIB WG has completed its documents,
   and the WG was closed in September 2007.  The mailing list stayed
   open for a while, and was closed a few years later.  The appropriate
   mailing list for IEEE 802.3 MIB modules discussion is STDS-802-3-
   MIB@LISTSERV.IEEE.ORG.

   To see general information about 802.3, including how they work and
   how to participate, go to http://www.ieee802.org/3/.

3.4.  IETF MIB Doctor Reviews

   The content of Section 5 of [RFC4663] is accurate also for this
   document, noting that from the point of view of the present document,
   802.3 should replace 802.1 wherever it occurs in the text.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document records the transfer of ownership of Ethernet-related
   MIB modules to IEEE 802.3.1 several years ago.  The transfer has no
   security implications.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no actions by IANA.

6.  IPR Considerations

   See Section 9 of [RFC4663].

7.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Juergen Schoenwaelder and Howard Frazier for their reviews
   and comments on both the initial and the present versions of this
   document.  During Working Group Last Call, Warren Kumari caught a
   nit, and Thomas Petch raised the point of ownership versus
   responsibility that resulted in some wording changes in the Abstract
   and Introduction.
