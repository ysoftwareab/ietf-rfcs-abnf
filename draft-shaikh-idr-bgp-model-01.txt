1.  Introduction

   This document describes a YANG [RFC6020] data model for BGP [RFC4271]
   protocol and policy configuration, as well as defining key
   operational state data.  The model is intended to be vendor-neutral,
   in order to allow operators to manage BGP configuration in
   heterogeneous environments with routers supplied by multiple vendors.
   The model is also intended to be readily mapped to existing
   implementations, however, to facilitate support from as large a set
   of routing hardware and software vendors as possible.

1.1.  Goals and approach

   This model does not (in the current iteration) aim to be feature
   complete (i.e., cover all possible features of a BGP implementation).
   Rather its development is driven by examination of BGP configurations
   in use across a number of operator network deployments.

   The focus area of the first version of the model is on base BGP
   protocol configuration and policy configuration with "hooks" to add
   support for additional address families, as well as operational data
   to enable a common model for reading BGP-related state from devices.

   The focus of the the BGP model described in this document is on
   providing the base configuration and operational state information
   relating to:

   o  The global BGP instance, and neighbors whose configuration is
      specified individually, or templated with the use of peer-groups.

   o  The address families that are supported by peers, and the global
      configuration which relates to them.

   o  The policies that relate to a neighbor - controlling the import
      and export of NLRI.

   Configuration items that are deemed to be widely available in
   existing major BGP implementations are included in the model.  Those
   configuration items that are only available from a single
   implementation are omitted from the model with the expectation they
   will be available in companion modules that augment the current
   model.  This allows clarity in identifying data that is part of the
   vendor-neutral model.

Internet-Draft                  BGP Model                     March 2015


   Where possible, naming in the model follows conventions used in
   available standards documents, and otherwise tries to be self-
   explanatory with sufficient descriptions of the intended behavior.
   Similarly, configuration data value constraints and default values,
   where used, are based on recommendations in current standards
   documentation.  Since implementations vary widely in this respect,
   this version of the model specifies only a limited set of defaults
   and ranges with the expectation of being more prescriptive in future
   versions based on actual operator use.

2.  Model overview

   The BGP model is defined across several YANG modules but at a high
   level is organized into four elements:

   o  base protocol configuration -- configuration affecting BGP
      protocol-related operations, defined at various levels of
      hierarchy.

   o  multiprotocol configuration -- configuration affecting individual
      address-families within BGP [RFC4760].

   o  policy configuration -- configuration defining the policies that
      act on routes sent (received) to (from) peers or other routing
      protocols.

   o  operational state -- variables used for monitoring, management,
      etc. of BGP operations.

   These modules also make use of the standard Internet types, such as
   IP addresses, autonomous system numbers, etc., defined in RFC 6991
   [RFC6991].

   Throughout the model, the approach described in
   [I-D.openconfig-netmod-opstate] is used to represent configuration
   (intended state), operational and derived state data.  That is to
   say, that each container holds a "config" and "state" sub-container -
   with the config container being used for configurable parameters, and
   the state container container holding representing both the
   operational state of configurable leaves, and derived counters and
   statistical information.

2.1.  BGP protocol configuration

   The BGP protocol configuration model is organized hierarchically,
   much like the majority of router implementations.  That is,
   configuration items can be specified at multiple levels, as shown
   below.

                    |  +-- (global-configuration-options)

                    |  +--rw neighbor* [neighbor-address]
                    |  +-- (neighbor-configuration-options)
                    +--rw peer-groups
                       +--rw peer-group* [peer-group-name]
                       +-- (neighbor-configuration-options)

   Users may specify configuration at a higher level and have it apply
   to all lower-level items, or provide overriding configuration at a
   lower level of the hierarchy.  Overriding configuration items are
   optional with per-neighbor configuration being the most specific or
   lowest level, followed by peer-group, and finally global.  Global
   configuration options reflect a subset of the per-peer-group or per-
   neighbor configuration options which are relevant to the entire BGP
   instance.

   The model makes the simplifying assumption that most of the
   configuration items are available at all levels of the hierarchy.
   That is, very little configuration is specific to a particular level
   in the hierarchy, other than obvious items such as "group- name" only
   being available for the peer group-level config.  A notable exception
   is for sub-address family configuration where some items are only
   applicable for a given AFI-SAFI combination.

   In order to allow common configuration to be applied to a set of
   neighbors, all neighbor configuration options are available within a
   peer-group.  A neighbor is associated to a particular peer-group
   through the use of a peer-group leaf (which provides a reference to a
   configured item in the peer-group list).

   Address-family configuration is made available in multiple points
   within the model - primarily within the global container, where
   instance-wide configuration can be set (for example, the BGP bestpath
   route selection options, or global policies relating to the address-
   family); and on a per-neighbor or per-peer-group basis, where
   address-families can be enabled or disabled, and policy associated
   with the parent entity applied.  Within the afi-safi container,
   generic configuration that applies to all address-families (e.g.,
   whether the AFI-SAFI is enabled) is presented at the top-level, with
   address-family specific containers made available for options
   relating to only that AFI-SAFI.  Within the current revision of the
   model a generic set of address-families, and common configuration and
   state options included - further work is expected to add additional
   parameters to this area of the model.

           |     |     +--rw l2vpn-evpn!

2.2.  Policy configuration overview

   The BGP policy configuration model references the generic YANG
   routing policy model described in [I-D.shaikh-rtgwg-policy-model].
   This model represents a condition-action policy framework.  This
   model adds BGP-specific conditions (e.g., matching on the community
   attribute), and actions (e.g., setting local preference) to the
   generic policy framework.

   Policies that are defined in the routing-policy model are then
   referenced in multiple places within the model:

   o  Within the global instance, where a policy applies to all address-
      families for all peers.

   o  On a global AFI-SAFI basis, where policies apply to all peers for
      a particular address-family.

   o  On a per-peer-group or per-neighbor basis - where the policy
      applies to all address-families for the particular parent entity.

   o  On a per-afi-safi basis within a neighbor or peer-group context,
      where the policy is specific to the AFI-SAFI.

                       |     +--rw apply-policy
                       +--rw apply-policy

2.3.  Operational data overview

   The BGP operational model contains a set of parameters which relate
   to the operational state of the various elements of the BGP router.
   As noted in Section 2 - the approach described in
   [I-D.openconfig-netmod-opstate] is utilised for the inclusion of
   operational and statistical data.  To this end, the "_state"
   groupings (those that contain derived operational parameters) are
   contained within the BGP operational model - and included within the
   relevant "state" containers throughout the core BGP model.  In some
   cases, operational information may be relevant to one instance of a
   common grouping, but not another - for example, the number of
   received, advertised and installed prefixes is relevant on a per-
   neighbor-basis, but is not required (or meaningful) when within the
   peer-group context.  To enable state to be added to particular
   contexts, the tree is augmented through the base BGP module to add
   these variables, without requiring separate groupings.

3.  Security Considerations

   BGP configuration has a significant impact on network operations, and
   as such any related protocol or model carries potential security
   risks.

   YANG data models are generally designed to be used with the NETCONF
   protocol over an SSH transport.  This provides an authenticated and
   secure channel over which to transfer BGP configuration and
   operational data.  Note that use of alternate transport or data

   encoding (e.g., JSON over HTTPS) would require similar mechanisms for
   authenticating and securing access to configuration data.

   Most of the data elements in the configuration model could be
   considered sensitive from a security standpoint.  Unauthorized access
   or invalid data could cause major disruption.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This YANG data model and the component modules currently use a
   temporary ad-hoc namespace.  If and when it is placed on redirected
   for the standards track, an appropriate namespace URI will be
   registered in the IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688].  The BGP YANG modules
   will be registered in the "YANG Module Names" registry [RFC6020].

5.  YANG modules

   The modules comprising the BGP configuration and operational model
   are described by the YANG modules in the sections below.  The base
   module imports the other modules to create the overall model.

Appendix B.  Change summary

B.1.  Changes between revisions -00 and -01

   The -01 revision reflects a number of changes, many based on feedback
   from implementors of the model on various routing platforms.

   o  Refactored model to explicitly provide 'config' and 'state'
      containers at each leaf node to enable consistent and predictable
      access to operational state data corresponding to configuration
      data.  This is based on the model design in
      [I-D.openconfig-netmod-opstate].

   o  Refactored multiprotocol module with explicit set of supported
      AFI-SAFI combinations (using YANG identities) in a flattened list.
      Focus was on common config with more AFI-SAFI specific
      configuration forthcoming in future revisions.

   o  Refactored BGP policy module to work with a new general routing
      policy model [I-D.shaikh-rtgwg-policy-model] by augmenting it with
      BGP-specific policy options (conditions, actions, and defined
      sets).

   o  Added enclosing containers to lists (e.g., neighbors, peer-groups,
      and AFI-SAFI)

   o  Removed neighbor configuration from the peer-group hierarchy.
      Neighbor configuration now has a peer-group leaf which references
      the peer group to which the neighbor belongs.

   o  Several new configuration items added to base bgp module,
      including adding some configuration items to the global hierarchy
      level.
