   A DHCP server of "server"is an Internet host that returns 
   configuration parameters to DHCP clients. 
    
   o "binding" 
    
   A binding is a collection of configuration parameters, including at 
   least an IP address, associated with or "bound to" a DHCP client. 
   Bindings are managed by DHCP servers. 
    
    
4. Introduction 
    
   PacketCable is a project conducted by Cable Television Laboratories, 
   Inc. (CableLabs) and its member companies aimed at identifying, 
   qualifying, and supporting Internet-based voice and video products 
   over cable systems. These products will represent new classes of 
   services utilizing cable-based packet communication networks. New 
   service classes include telephone calls and videoconferencing over 
   cable networks and the Internet. The services would be delivered 
   using the basic Internet Protocol (IP) technology that is used to 
   send data via the Internet. 
    
   The PacketCable embedded-MTA (MTA) is a single physical device with 
   dual personality: a Cable Modem (CM) and a VoIP device. Both of 
   these devices are administered by different entities. Both of the 
   personalities have different IP addresses and different IP 
   configurations. 
    
   PacketCable project produced specifications of VoIP elements, which 
   can be found in www.packetcable.com. The PacketCable VoIP Client uses 
   DHCP for configuration. Due to specific needs of PacketCable client a 
   new DHCP option is needed. The new option is designed to have a 
   number of sub-information, which is laid down in DHCP option fashion 
   [3]. 
    
5. PacketCable VoIP Client Configuration Option 
    
   The code for this option is TBD. 
    
   The PacketCable VoIP Client Configuration option is used by the 
   PacketCable VoIP clients to identify a list of valid PacketCable 
   specific network servers. 
    
   The option sub-fields contain information regarding these servers.  
    
   The option is included in DHCP OFFER-s, and is laid out as depicted 
   below: 
    
   ------------------------------------------------------------- 
   | TBD | Length | Subfield 1 | Subfield 2 | ... | Subfield n | 
   ------------------------------------------------------------- 
    
   Each sub-field is in the form of:

   --------------------------------------------------- 
   | Sub-field Number | Length | Subfield information | 
   --------------------------------------------------- 
    
   Each sub-field of the PacketCable VoIP Client Configuration 
   identifies a particular type of PacketCable server. Sub-fields 1 and 
   2 identify the primary and secondary PacketCable network DHCP 
   servers, sub-field 3 identifies the PacketCable service provider's 
   SNMP entity, and sub-fields 4 and 5 identify the primary and 
   secondary PacketCable network DNS servers. The Sub-fields are 
   summarized below: 
    
   -------------------------------------------------------------------- 
   |Option |Sub-field | Description and Comments                      |

6. PacketCable VoIP Client option Sub-field Definitions 
    
   The following parts provide detailed descriptions of each sub-field 
   of DHCP PacketCable VoIP Client option. Note that UDP port numbers 
   are normally standard values as defined in [4].  The port numbers 
   MAY be omitted, if the standard protocol ports are to be used as 
   defined in [4]. E.g.:the standard DNS UDP port number is 42/udp. If 
   non-standard port numbers are used, these MUST be appended as shown 
   below.  
    
6.1. Telephony Service Provider's DHCP Server Address 
    
   The Telephony Service Provider's (TSP) DHCP Server Address identifies 
   the DHCP server that will be used to obtain an MTA-unique IP address 
   for a given telephony service provider's network administrative 
   domain.  
    
   Sub-field 1 is the address of the network's primary Telephony Service 
   Provider DHCP server IP Address. Sub-field 2 is the address of the 
   network's secondary Telephony Service Provider DHCP server. Sub-field 
   2 MAY be specified to identify a redundant or backup DHCP server.

   The encoding syntax for sub-field 1 and sub-field 2 is as follows: 
    
   --------------------------------------------------------------------- 
   |Sub-field | Value         | Description and Comments               | 
   ===================================================================== 
   |     1    |[x.y.z.y]:port | IP address of Primary TSP DHCP Server  | 
   |          |               | The port number is to be used only if  | 
   |          |               | different than the default port number | 
   |          |               | is to be used.                         | 
   --------------------------------------------------------------------- 
   |     2    |[x.y.z.y]:port | IP address of Secondary TSP DHCP Server| 
   |          |               | The port number is to be used only if  | 
   |          |               | different than the default port number | 
   |          |               | is to be used.                         | 
   --------------------------------------------------------------------- 
    
6.2. Telephony Service Provider's SNMP Entity Address 
    
   The Telephony Service Provider's SNMP Entity Address is the network 
   address of the default server for a given telephony service 
   provider's network administrative domain. The Telephony Service 
   Provider's SNMP Entity Address component MUST be capable of accepting 
   SNMP traps. This address can be configured as either an FQDN or as an 
   IPv4 address. 
    
   The encoding of sub-field 3 is as follows: 
    
   -------------------------------------------------------------------- 
   |Sub-field | Value         | Description and Comments              | 
   ==================================================================== 
   |     3    |[x.y.z.y]:port | Either the IP address or the FQDN will| 
   |          |---------------| be configured. The port number is to  | 
   |          | FQDN:port     | be used only if different than the    | 
   |          |               | default port number is to be used.    | 
   -------------------------------------------------------------------- 
    
6.3. DNS system 
    
   The Telephony Service Provider's DNS server is required to resolve a 
   PacketCable device's FQDN into an IPv4 address. The DNS server's 
   address MUST be specified in the IPv4 format. 
    
   Sub-field 4 is the address of the network's primary DNS server IP 
   Address. Sub-field 5 is the address of the network's secondary DNS 
   server. Sub-field 5 MAY be specified to identify a redundant or 
   backup DNS server. 
    
   The encoding syntax for sub-field 4 and sub-field 5 is as follows:

   --------------------------------------------------------------------- 
    
6.4. Procedure for adding call control server types 
    
   A vendor may add a new sub-field by issuing an internet draft that 
   contains the new sub-field.  The new sub-field code MUST be labeled 
   "TBD."  This draft will then be submitted to the DHC working group, 
   and, if accepted for inclusion in the DHCP specification, a sub-
   option field code is assigned and the sub-option specification will 
   be published as an RFC, which will update this RFC.

        PacketCable VoIP Client Configuration           October 2000 
 
 
   The PacketCable VoIP Client Configuration option is used on the DHCP 
   messaging of both CM and VoIP device personalities. A typical MTA 
   boot operation is depicted in Figure 1 and can be described as 
   below: 
    
   1. When MTA boots the CM personality sends a broadcast DISCOVER 
   message with proper Vendor Client Identifier Option. 
    
   2. The DHCP server gives a proper address from CM IP address pool, 
   along with the PacketCable VoIP Client Configuration Option 
   populated with (at least) Telephony Service Provider DHCP Server IP 
   address(es). 
    
   3. The CM passes the PacketCable Client Configuration (PCC) 
   information to VoIP device. 
    
   4. The VoIP device uses the information in the Telephony Service 
   Provider IP DHCP Server Address field and unicasts the DISCOVER 
   message to the address(es). 
    
   5. Telephony Service Provider IP DHCP Server returns the IP 
   configuration for VoIP personality and PacketCable Client 
   Configuration information. 
    
   From this point on the MTA uses the FQDN information for PacketCable 
   SNMP server using Telephony Service Provider DNS servers, and 
   registers for service.  
    
7. Security Considerations 
    
   This draft relies on DHCP protocol [5] for authentication and 
   security, i.e. it does not provide either in excess of what DHCP is 
   (or will be) providing.
