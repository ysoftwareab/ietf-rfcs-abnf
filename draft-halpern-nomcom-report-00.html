<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>This document reports on the work of the 2008-2009 IETF
nominating committee (NomCom).  This draft summarizes the process steps that
were used this year, and the work that was done.  This is followed by
a discussion of process issues which caused difficulties for the
committee, but which require community agreement to before changes can
be made.  Finally, there are some observations about things which can
help future committees, and which may help the community to
understand.

Introduction</h3>

<p>This document provides a set of observations from the
2008/2009 nominating committee (NomCom) chair to the community.  These are
provided in an Internet-Draft, to complement the report provided by
the chair at the March 2009 plenary.  This is not a formal report from
the committee, and this report represents only one of many possible
views of the process.
</p>
<p>In discussing the work of the NomCom, this document
often refers to the committees judgment of the wishes of the
community.  (Or other similar words.) The committee is tasked by the
RFCs with making such judgments, and acting upon them.  As noted, in
some places it is even expected to report those judgments as part of
confirmation processes.  However, these judgments should not be
confused with formal determinations of rough consensus of the
community, particularly as might apply to changing procedures.  It is
not the NomCom's purview, nor their right,  nor is it practical with
the processes that are used, to make that sort of determination.  For
any process changes to actually be made, separate determination of the
actual rough consensus of the community is needed.

Getting Started</h3>

<p>The 2008-2009 IETF Nominating committee, like all nominating
committees for this community constituted since June 2004,  was
appointed and operated according to the rules defined in
<a class='info' href='#RFC3777'>[RFC3777]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Galvin, J., &ldquo;IAB and IESG Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>.  Lynn St. Amour (ISOC President and CEO)
announced my appointment on July 12, 2008.

<a name="rfc.section.2.1"></a><h3>2.1.&nbsp;
Randomness and Voting Member Selection</h3>

<p>I sent out the first call for volunteers to serve on the
nominating committee on July 15th, with the list of positions to be
filled.  Several additional calls for volunteers were made, including a
presentation at the Thursday Plenary at the Dublin IETF meeting.
</p>
<p>In my announcement send on August 1, 2008, I included a
planned time line, and the random seeds to be used in conjunction with
the procedure described in <a class='info' href='#RFC3797'>[RFC3797]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Eastlake, D., &ldquo;Publicly Verifiable Nominations Committee (NomCom) Random Selection,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>.
The seeds were the same as those
used by Lakshminath Dondeti the previous year:

Selection</h3>

<p>The NomCom volunteer list was announced, with affiliations,  for
challenge on August 
18.  No challenges were received, and the list was re-announced (minus
the IAOC removal) on August 25.  The random selection URL was updated,
as one of the announced URLs did not work.  On August 30, the results
of the random selection, along with the affiliation of the selected
individuals, and all of the seed information was announced, starting a
challenge period.  On September 8 the NomCom was seated and I began
working with the members to get the actual selection process in
place.  The selected volunteers with their announced affiliation, as
they were announced by email, were:
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Wasserman, Margaret; of ThingMagic moving to Sandstorm
</p>
<p>Isomaki, Markus; of Nokia
</p>
<p>Hoeneisen, Bernie; of Swisscom
</p>
<p>White, Russ; of Cisco
</p>
<p>Lepinsiki, Matthew; of BBN Technologies

</blockquote>
<p>The liaisons were Lakshminath Dondeti of Qualcomm as the previous
year's chair, Dave Oran of Cisco as IAB Liaison, Ross Callon of Juniper
as IESG liaison, and Bert Wijnen as ISOC Board of Trustees liaisons.

Liaisons and Confirming Bodies</h3>

<p>I met with the IAB chair and liaison, and exchanged email
with the ISOC liaison, to work out some of the processes.  The two
topics were what information would be provided for confirmation, and
how confirmation issues would be handled.
</p>
<p>Even if it appears that everything is simple and clean, such
conversations between the NomCom chair and the confirming bodies in
advance of the work are a very good idea.
</p>
<p>It was agreed with regard to confirmation information that in
addition to the descriptions of the candidates and the explanation of
why they are being nominated, the nominating committee would provide
most of the questionnaire to the confirming body.  The exact method
for defining what would be kept confidential to the NomCom would be
worked out once the NomCom was seated.
</p>
<p>With the IAB, it was also agreed that while the IAB would approve
or reject an entire slate, they would provide information to the
nominating committee with as much clarity as possible as to what the
problems were, if there were problems.

<a name="rfc.section.2.4"></a><h3>2.4.&nbsp;
Tools</h3>

<p>One of the most important aspects in practice for the
NomCom, and the NomCom chair, is the tools setup.  Henrik Levkowetz
built and maintains an extremely useful tool suite for the nominating
committee.  Henrik does not participate in the nominating committee
activities.  However, nominating committee chairs may wish to ask him
to officially serve as an adviser to the committee.  This allows him to
see information needed to diagnose problems with the tools.
</p>
<p>The tools need to be configured properly each year. The first piece
of configuration required is a public / private key pair created by
the NomCom chair.  The public key will be used by the tools.  The
chair must arrange to deliver the private key to the NomCom members.  
The email lists are an interesting case.  The usual practice has been,
and is recommended to be, to use a two part list.  The public list is
maintained by the secretariat, without an archive.  It copies all
received email to all members of the NomCom, and to a private list on
the tools site.  The private list is indexed and archived, and stored
encrypted with the years public key.  Via the tools, members can get
at the full indexed, processed, email information, by providing the
private key the NomCom chair gives them.
</p>
<p>The tools assist in keeping track of nominations, acceptances (or
turn-downs), questionnaires, and feedback.  They are extremely useful.

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
Organization, Scheduling, and Planning</h3>

<p>Starting on September 8, 2008 the NomCom organized itself,
scheduled conference calls, and began getting its work done.
</p>
<p>While I issued the initial calls for volunteers, the NomCom needed
to get several items sorted out as quickly as possible.  Specifically,
the job descriptions needed to be understood, and the questionnaires
needed to be defined.
</p>
<p>Once those two items were clarified, the NomCom moved on to working
out the interview process.  Interviews were conducted with a number of
people.  Some interviews were conducted to understand the needs of
bodies or slots to which the NomCom was responsible for making
appointments.  Some interviews were conducted to better understand
existing people, issues, or situations.  And interviews were conducted
to get opinions on nominees under consideration (within the
constraints of the confidentiality rules.)  Many people from the
leadership bodies were interviewed.  Not all the people on any body,
nor all the incumbents, were interviewed.  Interviews were scheduled
based on either the committees perception that incremental information
could be obtained usefully, or because an individual requested an
interview.  While it has the potential to produce an excess of
interviews, the nominating committee was able to interview all
individuals who requested time from us.  Most interviews were
conducted by two volunteer members of the committee.  A few of the
interviews were conducted by larger numbers of people due to the
importance of the topic and the potential information.  One of the
chairs jobs became making sure that folks who had agreed to perform
interviews actually did them.  Not due to lack of willingness, but
because many of the committee members were quite busy.
</p>
<p>There were many teleconferences.  Initial calls were every  two
weeks, and then during the busy part of the cycle they were as often
as every 6 days.  This year Cisco and Microsoft provided the
conference call facilities, for which I thank them.  We tried a free
conference call facility, but it had very bad international
access.

Job Descriptions</h3>

<p>The procedures call for the various bodies (IESG, IAB, and IAOC) to
provide job description for the jobs that need to be filled.  However,
the nominating committee is responsible for deciding what
qualifications and skills to actually look for, based on the provided
job descriptions and the community feedback.
</p>
<p>This leads to an interesting question.  If the nominating committee
decides that somewhat different qualifications are needed than were
asked for, what should it do?  At the very least, it is required to
provide the list of what it actually looked for to the confirming
body.  It would seem helpful if, when there is a difference, the
nominating committee could tell the community what it really wants.
We could not find a good way to do this.   As there was no significant
initial difference (minor issues were discussed with liaisons), the
nominating committee simply published the provided job descriptions.
Later community input was used to complement those descriptions.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2"></a><h3>3.2.&nbsp;
Questionnaire</h3>

<p>There were two issues the NomCom needed to work out for the
questionnaires.  First was what questions to ask.  This sounds easy,
but is actually a good opportunity for the NomCom to start thinking
about what matters to the volunteers and how they will gather
information.  After significant exchanges, the content of the
questionnaires was worked out.
</p>
<p>It probably was unfortunate that I had posted the previous years
questionnaires on the web site, as this confused some people about
what they were supposed to do.
</p>
<p>In conjunction with this, the nominating committee needed to work
out, and coordinate with the confirming bodies, what information would
be provided from the questionnaires in the confirmation process.  Two
specific decisions were made, and worked well.
</p>
<p>The questionnaires were explicitly and clearly labeled as to what
information would be provided to the confirming bodies, and what would
be kept confidential to the nominating committee itself.  It was
concluded based on prior years that clear communication about the
expectation that most of the information would be shared with the
confirming body was necessary.
</p>
<p>The nominating committee debated what was the best way to ask for
private information.  The decision was that a single question at the
end of each questionnaire would ask for further input not to be shared
with the confirming bodies.  This allowed folks to tell the NomCom
what they thought was important while clearly allowing the NomCom to
share enough information with the confirming body to help them perform
their job.

<a name="rfc.section.4"></a><h3>4.&nbsp;
Collection of Feedback</h3>

<p>The nominating committee can not evaluate the nominees on its own.
The 10 volunteers, even with the help of the liaisons, simply do not
know all the people, or all the relevant information even about the
people they individually know.  Community feedback is an essential
part of the process.
</p>
<p>In order to get this feedback, the nominating committee reviews the
nominees, and then sends out requests for feedback.  These requests
must be done in a fashion that complies with the confidentiality
rules in place.  The practice that has developed is to send the
request to a list of people who may have useful information.  The list
includes not just people under serious consideration, but also some
number of folks who are not being considered, typically because they
are not willing or able to serve.  This padding is intended to provide
some confidentiality to the actual process.
</p>
<p>In some cases, because the list of nominees was very long, the
committee also made a first pass at removing people from the list
before soliciting feedback.  This is useful to help the community
focus where it will do the most good.  But it has the drawback of
requiring certain preliminary decisions (which can be changed later)
before there really is sufficient information.
</p>
<p>It would probably have been useful if I could have found a good way
to tell the community what constitutes helpful or unhelpful feedback.
Helpful feedback is specific and clear.  "Person X did action Y which
had benefit / drawback Z."  This can be coupled with indications as to
whether the commenter thinks this was isolated, or a pattern (for good
or ill.)  General descriptions of patterns of positive or negative
behavior are helpful, but nowhere near as helpful as specifics.
General comments like "A would make a good IAB member" or "how could
you possibly consider B for that IESG slot?" are actually relatively
unhelpful.  The NomCom process is not voting, and the committee does
not count support.  While it means something if several vague positive
notes are received, and no negative ones, it does not actually help
the committee evaluate whether this person would make a better or
worse candidate than some other nominee.  Another common kind of
response that is less helpful on 
its own is simple ranked lists of nominees.   If coupled with feature
descriptions ("I prefer L to M because of property N" then such lists
gain some value.
</p>
<p>In keeping with the confidentiality rules, one of the properties of
the tool is that a person will never see their own name on the list of
names on which feedback is solicited.  This is to avoid telling the
person whether they are, or are not shortlisted.  It is presumed that
the individual is capable of providing feedback on themselves anyway.
As noted below, this particular piece of opacity does not work.  Folks
can just ask around, find someone else they know who has also
solicited, and usually find out if their name was on the list.  (Yes,
it can be argued that the confidentiality rules tell people not to
relay that sort of information.  But since we know from individual
reports that this happens frequently, the reality seems more relevant
than the theory.)

Candidate Selection Process</h3>

<p>The process of selecting candidates for confirmation, and
then working with the confirming body, is a complex and mostly
confidential one.  It is the nominating committee chair's job to find a
process which will work, and then shepherd it through to
completion.
</p>
<p>The nominating committee used many different tools, with
conversations (both voice and email) being the most important one.  At
various points, selection processes were applied to individuals or
slates of individuals.  When explicit votes were needed, preferential
ballots were used, with resolution based on Condorcet voting with
Instant-runoff voting (IRV)
for resolving those situations where Condorcet was inconclusive.
(These techniques are described in many web sites, and references were
provided to the committee as part of the process of agreeing to use
this resolution mechanism.  I do not know how authoritative any one
site is, so the reader is advised to search on their own if they are
interested in more details on preferential voting resolution methods
and their pluses and minuses.)  This
was managed through open source tools, and proved quite effective.
</p>
<p>Candidates were selected, approved by confirming bodies, and their
willingness and availability verified by a few days after the
RFC specified February 22nd deadline.

Issues</h3>

<p>A number of issues of various types were encountered during the
nominating committee process.  As a rule of thumb, it seems the best
thing a nominating committee chair can do when planning the schedule
is to assume things will go wrong.  So push the schedule hard even
when it looks like there is plenty of time.  You will need it.
</p>
<p>The following sections describe some of the issues which in my
personal opinion, based on what I observed, should be kept in mind in
working with the process.  It is my recommendation that some of these
issues be addressed by changes in the defined processes.

Volunteer exclusion</h3>

<p>One of the first items of confusion was when it was noticed that
the spirit of the exclusion from eligibility to serve on the NomCom
and the letter of the law do not match.  The spirit is that folks
serving on bodies to which the NomCom is making appointments shall
not themselves be volunteer members of the NomCom.  The letter of the
law lists the IAB and IESG.  It does not list the IAOC.
</p>
<p>One volunteer
realized after he volunteered that as a sitting IAOC member, he should
not be a volunteer member of the NomCom.  So he politely asked to
remove himself from the list.  I removed him.  But the letter of the
law ought to match the intent.  Until it does, NomCom chairs should
keep an eye open for this potential inconsistency.  If the defining
documents are revised for any reason, the text there should be repaired
as well.

<a name="rfc.section.6.2"></a><h3>6.2.&nbsp;
Liaison participation</h3>

<p>As mentioned earlier, I, as chaired worked out with the confirming
bodies and the liaisons the rules for the liaison participation in the
NomCom.  The goal of this was to enable the liaisons to provide useful
input while avoiding the reported historical problems of some liaisons
in some years having too much influence in the deliberation process.
There is distinct ambiguity in the written rules as to the intended
and desired scope of participation by the liaisons in the NomCom
discussions.
</p>
<p>As per the rules, and in order to permit the liaisons to be present
for as much of the discussion as possible, the liaisons were permitted
to participate in the discussions of how often we met or held phone
calls, and when such activities occurred. 
</p>
<p>The terms of participation in the discussion of individuals and
positions were designed to allow useful information, while preventing
excess.
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Liaisons are always permitted to provide information from the
bodies they represent, and to answer questions about those bodies

they feel is helpful to the committee

<a name="rfc.section.6.3"></a><h3>6.3.&nbsp;
Nominee List Confidentiality</h3>

<p>The RFCs defining the NomCom process require that all information,
including the lists of nominees, who has accepted nomination, and the
lists of who is under actual consideration by the nominating
committee, be kept confidential.  While this is an attractive rule, it
has resulted in a major problem and I believe needs to be revised.
</p>
<p>As described above, the nominating committee needs information from
the community.  To comply with current rules a padded set of names is
sent to a portion of the community for feedback.  This has multiple
problems.  First and foremost, it does not achieve the
objective. Folks will learn if they are on the list being solicited.
With the number of people who see the list, folks who want to know can
find out who is on the list.  (People are people, and they will talk
to each other.   Pretending otherwise is unrealistic.  Hundreds of
people do not keep a secret.)  And people will determine who the pads
are.  Many times, no matter how hard the committee works, it will be
obvious which names are padding.
</p>
<p>As a minor point, the padding is extra work.  The
committee has to come up with credible names that they think won't
be well known as having turned down the nomination.  And then the
chair really should check with those folks before using them as
padding.  I made some mistakes in that regard, and it caused some
people difficulty.
</p>
<p>The most important reason for removing the confidentiality of the
nominees list is that the current process prevents the most important
source of input.  The community members who are not the leadership, 
the grass roots if you will, are the people who may
well know important and useful information about nominees, but are not
going to be solicited, much less 
interviewed.  One of the main points of this nominating committee process 
is to avoid having the
leadership self-appoint.  Having a large portion of the community know
the list of nominees, and another large portion not know the list, is
counter to the goals.
</p>
<p>My personal recommendation would be that the list of all
individuals who have accepted nomination for any given position be
available publicly starting 24 hours after the initial solicitation of
nominees.  This should include the individual, affiliation, and
position, but no information as to where the nomination came from.
Incumbents should be treated as anyone else in terms of listing,
listing them when they have agreed to be considered as nominees.
Treating the incumbents any differently from other folks would merely
confuse the feedback.

<a name="rfc.section.6.4"></a><h3>6.4.&nbsp;
The IAB Roles</h3>

<p>Appointment of members to the IAB (either new members, or
reappointment of existing members) is an important part of the
nominating committee job.  This year there was a complication in this
task. As far as the nominating committee could determine, the
community at large had very little understanding of what the IAB did,
or what made a good or bad IAB member.  There was also, for a variety
of reasons, very little documentary evidence as to what individual
participants in the IAB had done in that role.  This was further
complicated by confusion in the community, and possibly on the
nominating committee, as to what actions were just a person being a
good IETF member, and what actions were a person being a positive IAB
member.  It is presumed that the two are not interchangeable.
</p>
<p>Part of what made this particularly complex is that the issue was
not about whether the IAB is a positive part of the IETF.  The
community sees the IAB as an important and positive part of the IETF.
But when asked to take that a step further, into the details which
affect the selection process, there was significant difficulty.
</p>

<a name="rfc.section.6.5"></a><h3>6.5.&nbsp;
Multiple Leaders from a Company</h3>

<p>For many very good reasons, the IETF does not have strict rules on
how many people from a company may serve on the IAB or IESG (or IAOC.)
At the same time, it is understood by the nominating committee that
having a large number of people from one company on any given body is
not a good idea.
</p>
<p>The only reason this is even an issue is that when it comes time to
decide, different members of the NomCom, and of the community, will
weight this differently.  That too is fine.  It is merely important
to understand that this is a legitimate issue for nominating committee
members to consider.
</p>
<p>There is a potential side-issue, which I would also prefer not
result in an additional rule.  The nominating committee rules cover
the affiliations of the volunteers.  They do not count the affiliation
of the liaisons or the chair.  It would probably be a good idea for
those bodies appointing liaisons to keep an eye open for extreme
cases.  It would be awkward to have a committee with two volunteers,
two liaisons, and a chair all from the same company.  It would not
violate the letter of the rules, but would certainly be seen as
unfortunate.

<a name="rfc.section.6.6"></a><h3>6.6.&nbsp;
ADs and chairs</h3>

<p>One of the topics that came up this year is the policies with
regard to ADs and chairs.  As with other things, this is a matter
where the nominating committee must judge the temper of the
community.  The conclusions described here are this years committees
understandings of the community view.  There are two loosely related
issues.
</p>
<p>The first is the question of ADs serving as working group chairs.
This can occur across areas, or within an area.  The sense we
understood from the community is that even across areas this is not a
good idea.  ADs serving as chairs clearly have much more influence
with their Area Director, and as such weaken the checks and balances
of the system.  Within their own area, even with their co-AD serving
as responsible AD, this is seen as even more of a bad idea.
Obviously, there are transition situations (it takes time to find new
chairs) and special situations ("I thought it was done already") that
complicate any hard rule.  But as a sense of the community, this
seemed to this committee to be a bad idea.  It is not clear where,
other than this sort of document, these observations about "bad
practices" can be recorded to assist future activities.
</p>
<p>A much subtler and more nuanced situation is the way that various
ADs go about picking chairs for working groups.  It is very common for
ADs to want to pick chairs that they can work with.  It makes life
MUCH easier.  This does however have a tendency to center the pool of
chairs in an area around a few small groups.  Some ADs have used
public calls for nominations as a way to counter this trend.  Such
public calls often bring forward names that the AD would not have
considered who are strong, capable individuals.  Sometimes even more
complex canvassing for good chairs is needed, particularly when the
working group has a complex set of constraints it needs to work
within.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>This is a report on an activity that occurred.  Every effort
has been made to respect the mandatory confidentiality aspects of that
activity.  Some of the proposals in this document would change those
properties, and such effect are clearly an important part of the
consideration of such changes.  It is the author's view that the
trade-off would be to the benefit of the community.
</p>
<p>The NomCom this year followed the practices of the last several
years with regard to managing information confidentiality.  The
archives of the comments, questionnaires, and other email to the
committee are stored encrypted on a server manage by Henrik, with the
decryption key known to the committee members.  Distribution of that
private key used a private password protected web site, with the
password provided to committee members by phone.  If the committee can
be organized before the second face-to-face IETF meeting of the year,
the decryption key can be distributed manually at that meeting.
