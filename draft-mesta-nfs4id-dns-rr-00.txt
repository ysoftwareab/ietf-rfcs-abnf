Abstract

   This document describes a new DNS Resource Record (RR) type that will
   be utilized by NFSv4 clients and servers to determine the domain
   string to utilize for on-the-wire user/group name attributes and ACL
   entry information.  Discussion and suggestions for improvements
   requested.

1.  Introduction

   Version 4 of the Network File System (NFSv4) protocol specification
   [RFC3530] introduces a way for clients and servers to exchange file
   ownership and ACL entry information as string names qualified with a
   domain name, whereas earlier versions of the protocol used 32-bit
   integers for the same type of identifier meta data.  Section 5.8 of
   [RFC3530] defines the generic format for string based identifiers to
   be "[user|group]@dns_domain".

   The string identifier prescribed suggests that the domain to be used
   for the on-the-wire format be a DNS domain.  However, the use of an
   NFSv4 client's and server's default DNS domain to qualify user/group
   names would be inappropriate on network configurations that utilize
   multiple DNS domains, but still use a common user/group name space
   throughout.  This would lead to user/group name recognition failures
   across the network, at either client or server side, due to
   potentially mismatched domains.  More succinctly, accessing NFSv4
   managed files across multiple DNS domains can cause string
   identifiers to be mapped to "nobody", regardless of whether a common
   user/group name space is shared or not.

   The challenge presented is then to have a mechanism for distributing
   a common domain configuration for use by NFSv4 implementations that
   only deal with domain-agnostic identifiers; more specifically, for
   NFSv4 clients and servers that are administratively controlled by
   distinct DNS domains.

2.  The NFS4 ID Domain Resource Record

   The general syntax for an NFS4ID resource record, whose type is
   expected to be IANA assigned as per [RFC2929], is:

       <owner>  <ttl>  <class>   NFS4ID   "domain string"

   where:

      *  <owner>, <ttl> and <class> specify the zone, time-to-live and
         "IN" respectively, as as defined in [RFC1034].

      *  The RDATA for this record is an arbitrary string that will be
         used to specify the domain to use in 'owner', 'owner_group' and
         ACL entry information, as defined by [RFC3530].

   The proposed RR is meant for use solely by NFSv4; the use of the
   RDATA field to store additional class information will lead to the
   familiar sub-typing issues associated with the use of TXT RR's
   [RFC1464].

3.  Example: Using the NFS4ID RR

   As a real world example, assume that an enterprise has a top level
   domain of "sample.com" and that it has multiple (perhaps
   geographically dispersed) DNS domains.  For the sake of the current
   discussion, two domains is more than enough; "foo.sample.com" and
   "bar.sample.com".  Assume further that NFSv4 has been deployed across
   these DNS domains and there are active NFSv4 mounts crossing the DNS
   domain boundary.

3.1  No NFS4ID RR Available

   Since no NFS4ID RR exists, then the NFSv4 clients and servers that
   have active cross-domain mounts should be sending user/group name
   attributes of the form "[user|group]@foo.sample.com" or "[user|
   group]@bar.sample.com".

   If a user in client.foo.sample.com wanted to access his/her files in
   server.bar.sample.com, the user would find his/her files (seemingly)
   being owned by "nobody".  The reason for this is that client.foo is
   trying to match server.bar's domain to its own, and since the
   domains are mismatched, that is, the DNS domain itself is being used
   for NFSv4 transactions, the client has no choice but to reject the
   user/group mapping.

3.2  NFS4ID RR Available

   Since the NFS4ID RR is available, the following line should be part
   of both DNS domains' zone configuration file:

                     IN        NFS4ID       "sample.com"

   Under this scenario, client.foo.sample.com would access the user's
   data in server.bar.sample.com; this time, however, the user and
   group name are of the form "[user|group@sample.com" on-the-wire.  The
   client will attempt to match the domain in the in-bound user/group
   attribute data and will match its own configured domain since both
   client.foo and server.bar are utilizing the same domain for NFSv4
   transactions.
