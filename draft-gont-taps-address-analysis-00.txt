1.  Introduction

   IPv6 addresses may differ in a number of properties, such as address
   scope (e.g. link-local vs. global), stability (e.g. stable addresses
   vs. temporary addresses), and intended usage type (outgoing
   communications vs. incomming communications).  While often
   overlooked, these properties have impact on areas such as security,
   privacy, and interoperability.

   This document analyzes the impact of a number of properties of IPv6
   addresses on areas such as security and privacy, and analyzes how
   IPv6 addresses are curently generated and employed by different
   operating systems and applications.

2.  Terminology

   This document employs the definitions of "public address", "stable
   address", and "temporary address" from Section 2 of [RFC7721].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft             IPv6 Address Usage                 March 2018


3.  Background

   Predictable IPv6 addresses result in a number of security and privacy
   implications.  For example, [Barnes2012] discusses how patterns in
   network prefixes can be leveraged for IPv6 address scanning.  On the
   other hand, [RFC7707], [RFC7721] and [RFC7217] discuss the security
   and privacy implications of predictable IPv6 Interface Identifiers
   (IIDs).

   Given the aforementioned previous work in this area, and the formal
   specification update produced by [RFC8064], we expect (and assume in
   the rest of this document) that implementations have replaced any
   schemes that produce predictable addresses with alternative schemes
   that avoid such patterns (e.g., RFC7217 in replacement of the
   traditional SLAAC addresses that embed link-layer addresses).

4.  IPv6 Address Properties

   There are three parameters that affect the security and privacy
   properties of an IPv6 address:

   o  Scope

   o  Stability

   o  Usage type (client-like "outgoing connections" vs. server-like
      "incoming connections")

   Section 4.1, Section 4.2, and Section 4.3 discuss the security and
   privacy implications (and associated tradeoffs) of the scope,
   stability and usage type properties of IPv6 addresses, respectively.

4.1.  Address Scope Considerations

   The IPv6 address scope can, in some scenarios, limit the attack
   exposure of a node as a result of the implicit isolation provided by
   a non-global address scope.  For example, a node that only employs
   link-local addresses may, in principle, only be exposed to attack
   from other nodes in the local link.  Hosts employing only Unique
   Local Addresses (ULAs) may be more isolated from attack than those
   employing Global Unicast Addresses (GUAs), assuming that proper
   packet filtering is enforced at the network edge.

   The potential protection provided by a non-global addresses should
   not be regarded as a complete security strategy, but rather as a form
   of "prophylactic" security (see
   [I-D.gont-opsawg-firewalls-analysis]).

Internet-Draft             IPv6 Address Usage                 March 2018


   We note that the use of non-global addresses is usually limited to a
   reduced type of applications/protocols that e.g. are only meant to
   operate on a reduced scope, and hence their applicability may be
   limited.

   A discussion of ULA usage considerations can be found in
   [I-D.ietf-v6ops-ula-usage-considerations].

4.2.  Address Stability Considerations

   The stability of an address has two associated security/privacy
   implications:

   o  Ability of an attacker to correlate network activity

   o  Exposure to attack

   For obvious reasons, an address that is employed for multiple
   communication instances allows the aforementioned network activities
   to be correlated.  The longer an address is employed (i.e., the more
   stable it is), the longer such correlation will be possible.  In the
   worst-case scenario, a stable address that is employed for multiple
   communication instances over time will allow all such activities to
   be correlated.  On the other hand, if a host were to generate (and
   eventually "throw away") one new address for each communication
   instance (e.g., TCP connection), network activity correlation would
   be mitigated.

   NOTE:
      The use of constant IIDs (as in traditional SLAAC) result in
      addresses that, while not constant as a whole (since the prefix
      changes), contain a globally-unique value that leaks out the node
      "identity".  Such addresses result in the worst possible security
      and privacy implications, and their use has been deprecated by
      [RFC8064].

   Typically, when it comes to attack exposure, the longer an address is
   employed the longer an attacker is exposed to attacks (e.g. an
   attacker has more time to find the address in the first place
   [RFC7707]).  While such exposure is traditionally associated with the
   stability of the address, the usage type of the address (see
   Section 4.3) may also have an impact on attack exposure.

   A popular approach to mitigate network activity correlation is the
   use of "temporary addresses" [RFC4941].  Temporary addresses are
   typically configured and employed along with stable addresses, with
   the temporary addresses employed for outgoing communications, and the
   stable addresses employed for incoming communications.

Internet-Draft             IPv6 Address Usage                 March 2018


   NOTE:
      Ongoing work [I-D.gont-6man-non-stable-iids] aims at updating
      [RFC4941] such that temporary addresses can be employed without
      the need to configure stable addresses.

   We note that the extent to which temporary addresses provide improved
   mitigation of network activity correlation and/or reduced attack
   exposure may be questionable and/or limited in some scenarios.  For
   example, a temporary address that is reachable for, say, a few hours
   has a questionable "reduced exposure" (particularly when automated
   attack tools do not typically require such a long period of time to
   complete their task).  Similarly, if network activity can be
   correlated for the life of such address (e.g., on the order of
   several hours), such period of time might be long enough for the
   attacker to correlate all the network activity he is meaning to
   correlate.

   In order to better mitigate network activity correlation and/or
   possibly reduce host exposure, an implementation might want to either
   reduce the preferred lifetime of a temporary address, or even better,
   generate one new temporary address for each new transport protocol
   instance.  However, the associated lifetime/stability of an address
   may have a negative impact on the network.  For example, if a node
   were to employ "throw away" IPv6 addresses, or employ temporary
   addresses [RFC4941] with a short preferred lifetime, local nodes
   might need to maintain too many entries in their Neighbor Cache, and
   a number of devices (possibly enforcing security policies) might also
   need to cope with such additional state.

   Additionally, enforcing a maximum lifetime on IPv6 addresses may
   cause long-lived TCP connections to fail.  For example, an address
   becoming "Invalid" (after transitioning through the "Preferred" and
   "Deprecated" states) would cause the TCP connections employing them
   to break.  This, in turn, would cause e.g. long-lived SSH sessions to
   break/fail.

   In some scenarios, attack exposure may be reduced by limiting the
   usage of temporary addresses to outgoing connections, and prevent
   such addresses from being used for incoming connections (please see
   Section 4.3).

4.3.  Usage Type Considerations

   A node that employs one of its addresses to communicate with an
   external server (i.e., to perform an "outgoing connection") may cause
   such address to become exposed to attack.  For example, once the
   external server receives an incoming connection, the corresponding
   server might launch an attack against the aforementioned address.  A

Internet-Draft             IPv6 Address Usage                 March 2018


   real-world instance of this type of scenario has been documented in
   [Hein].

   However, we note that employing an IPv6 address for outgoing
   communications need not increase the exposure of local services to
   other parties.  For example, nodes could employ temporary addresses
   only for outgoing connections, but not for incoming connections.
   Thus, external nodes that learn about client's addresses could not
   really leverage such addresses for actively contacting the clients.

   There are multiple ways in which this could possibly be achieved,
   with different implications.  Namely:

   o  Run a host-based or network-based firewall

   o  Bind services to specific (explicit) addresses

   o  Bind services only to stable addresses

   A client could simply run a host-based firewall that only allows
   incoming connections on the stable addresses.  This is clearly more
   of an operational way of achieving the desired functionality, and may
   require good firewall/host integration (e.g., the firewall should be
   able to tell stable vs. temporary addresses), may require the client
   to run additional firewall software for this specific purpose, etc.
   In other scenarios, a network-based firewall could be configured to
   allow outgoing communications from all internal addresses, but only
   allow incoming communications to stable addresses.  For obvious
   reasons, this is generally only applicable to networks where incoming
   communications are allowed to a limited number of hosts/servers.

   Services could be bound to specific (explicit) addresses, rather than
   to all locally-configured addresses.  However, there are a number of
   short-comings associated with this approach.  Firstly, an application
   would need to be able to learn all of its addresses and associated
   stability properties, something that tends to be non-trivial and non-
   portable, and that also makes applications protocol-dependent,
   unnecessarily.  Secondly, the BSD Sockets API does not really allow a
   socket to be bound to a subset of the node's addresses.  That is,
   sockets can be bound to a single address or to all available
   addresses (wildcard), but not to a subset of all the configured
   addresses.

   Binding services only to stable addresses provides a clean separation
   between addresses employed for client-like outgoing connections and
   server-like incoming connections.  However, we currently lack an
   appropriate API for nodes to be able to specify that a socket should
   only be bound to stable addresses.

Internet-Draft             IPv6 Address Usage                 March 2018


5.  Issues Associated with Sub-optimal IPv6 Address Usage

5.1.  Correlation of Network Activity

   As discussed in [RFC7721], a node that reuses an IPv6 address for
   multiple communication instances would allow the correlation of such
   network activities.  This could be the case when the same IPv6
   address is employed by several instances of the same application
   (e.g., a browser in "privacy" mode and a browser in "normal" mode),
   or when the same IPv6 address is employed by two different
   applications on the same node (e.g., a browser in "privacy" mode, and
   an email client).

   Particularly for privacy-sensitive applications, an application or
   system might want to limit the usage of a given IPv6 address to a
   single communication instance, a single application, a single user on
   the system, etc.  However, given current APIs, this is practically
   impossible.

5.2.  Testing for the Presence of Node in the Network

   The stable addresses recommended in [RFC8064] use stable IIDs defined
   in [RFC7217].  One key part of that algorithm is that if a device
   connects to a given network at different times, it will always
   configure the same IPv6 addresses on that network.  If the device
   hosts a service ready to accept connections on that stable address,
   adversaries can test the presence of the device on the network by
   attempting connections to that stable address.  Stable addresses used
   by listening services will thus enable testing whether a specific
   device is returning to a particular network, which in a number of
   cases might be considered a privacy issue.

5.3.  Unexpected Address Discovery

   Systems like DNS-Based Service Discovery [RFC6763] allow clients to
   discover services within a limited scope, that can be defined by a
   domain name.  These services are not advertised outside of that
   scope, and thus do not expect to be discovered by random parties on
   the Internet.  However, such services may be easily discoverable if
   they listen for connections to IPv6 addresses that a client process
   also uses as source address when connecting to remote servers.

   NOTE:
      An example of such unexpected discovery is described in [Hein].  A
      network manager observed scanning traffic directed at the
      temporary addresses of local devices.  The analysis in [Hein]
      shows that the scanners learned the addresses by observing the
      device contact an NTP service ([RFC5905]).  The remote scanning



Gont, et al.           Expires September 22, 2018               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft             IPv6 Address Usage                 March 2018


      was possible because the local devices were also accepting
      connections directed to the temporary addresses.

   It should be obvious from the example that the "attack surface" of
   the services is increased because they are bond to the same IPv6
   addresses that are also used by clients for outgoing communications
   with remote systems.  But the overlap between "client" and "server"
   addresses is only one part of the problem.  Suppose that a device
   hosts both a video game and a home automation application.  The video
   game users will be able to discover the IPv6 address of the game
   server.  If the home automation server listens to the same IPv6
   addresses, it is now exposed to connection attempts by all these
   users.  That, too, increases the attack surface of the home
   automation server.

5.4.  Availability Outside the Expected Scope

   The IPv6 addressing architecture [RFC4291] defines multiple address
   scopes.  In practice, devices are often configured with globally
   reachable unicast addresses, link local addresses, and Unique Local
   IPv6 Unicast Addresses (ULA) [RFC4193].  Availability outside the
   expected scope happens when a service is expected to be only
   available in some local scope, but inadvertently becomes available to
   remote parties.  That could happen for example if a service is meant
   to be available only on a given link, but becomes reachable through
   ULA or through globally reachable addresses, or if a service is meant
   to be available only inside some organization's perimeter and becomes
   reachable through globally reachable addresses.  It will happen in
   particular if a service intended for some local scope is programmed
   to bind to "unspecified" addresses, which in practice means every
   address configured for the device.

6.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA registries within this document.  The RFC-Editor
   can remove this section before publication of this document as an
   RFC.

7.  Security Considerations

   The security and privacy implications associated with the
   predictability and lifetime of IPv6 addresses has been analyzed in
   [RFC7217] [RFC7721], and [RFC7707].  This document complements and
   extends the aforementioned analysis by considering other IPv6
   properties such as the address scope and address usage type, and the
   associated tradeoffs.
