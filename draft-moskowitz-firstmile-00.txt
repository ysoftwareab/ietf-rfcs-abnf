                  Security alerts over the first MILE
                    draft-moskowitz-firstmile-00.txt

Abstract

   This document describes a pub/sub styled protocol to send security
   alerts to a security monitor that can feed into MILE and other
   management platforms.  It uses data structures from NETCONF, MILE,
   and IPFIX to manage the reporting and report security alerts.

1.  Introduction

   This document proposes a set of protocols to automate the reporting
   of security alerts to the various monitoring systems.  The intent is
   primarily to automate the input of security events to the MILE
   environment (RID [RFC6545] and IODEF [I-D.ietf-mile-rfc5070-bis]).
   Any authorized monitoring system can subscribe to any of the security
   alerts reports.

   An Internet security defense device first registers with a security
   alert monitoring system.  At this point the content and protocol used
   has not been identified.  Since such a registration is normally at
   'quiet time', the registration does not occur during a network
   congested time and can use some HTTPS-based service.  At this time
   both systems exchange their X.509 identifiers to be used for the sub/
   pub security and identification.

   Once a defense device is registered, the monitoring system can
   subscribe to it for those alerts in needs to receive.  The
   subscription protocol should use NETCONF [RFC6536] with the
   publication/subscription push service [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push].
   If the system needs a "pull" service, the NETCONF and I2RS
   subscription service could be expanded to support a pull service.

   Any secure NETCONF transport that this pub/sub service support can be
   used.

   The defense device publishes security alerts to subscribed monitors
   using IODEF or IPFIX [RFC7011] data structures.  The protocol(s) for
   these reports are discussed within this document.

2.  Terms and Definitions

2.1.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Problem Space

   At the time of developing this document, there is no IETF defined set
   of standardized security alert messages and protocols.
   Administrators of systems which provide MILE service currently use
   "cut-and-past" where they cut selected messages from proprietary
   monitoring systems and past these messages into their MILE
   environment.  The intent here is to standardize and automate this
   process.  It is recognized that many of these alerts are too detailed
   to be actionable.  Some implementations of the alert monitor will
   include analytic tools to select the actionable information from the
   alerts.  Alerts which are too detailed to be actionable or alerts
   which include analytical tools are outside of any standardizing
   process.

   Many of the needed alerts are scattered throughout the various
   standards like IPFIX and IODEF, but are not collected together as
   recognized security alerts that should be aggregated into a reporting
   framework.

4.  The first mile of security alerts

   There are three components to the first MILE process

   o  Register

   o  Subscribe

   o  Publish

4.1.  Register

   An Internet security defense device first registers with a security
   alert monitoring system.  This is typically done at the time the
   device is installed, but may occur later as the device is registered
   to more monitoring systems.  There is no theoretical limit on the

Internet-Draft                 first MILE                     March 2016


   number of monitors a device is registered to.  The limit within a
   system are practical limits based on internal limits within the
   device.

   Most monitors will be commercial and the registration will be based
   on existing business relationships.  One such example is the ISP's
   security monitor.  It is possible that a CERT may accept direct
   registration without a business relationship.  However this may
   require more study to ensure that this will not introduce potential
   attacks of false reporting to CERTs.

   The actual content of the registration has not been determined.
   Minimally it needs to include

   o  Identifiers (e.g.  X.509 certificates)

   o  Reports available from device (i.e. what to subscribe to)

   o  Subscription protocols(s)

   o  Publication protocols(s)

   A device can alter any of its registered information at any time as
   well as cancel a registration.

4.2.  Subscribe

   Once a defense device is registered, the monitoring system can
   subscribe to it for those alerts in needs to receive.  This is
   typically done via NETCONF, but is controlled by what the device
   registered as supported subscript protocols.

   A monitor can subscribe or unsubscribe for reports at any time.  With
   the first subscription, a secure communication transport will be
   enabled from the device to the monitor.  See Section 4.3 for more on
   the this secure transport.

4.3.  Publish

   The defense device publishes security alerts to subscribed monitors.
   The reports will be sent over the subscribed protocol using the
   subscribed data model, either IODEF or IPFIX.

   Since these alerts may be reported during an attack that degrades
   communications, many of the DOTS requirements
   [I-D.ietf-dots-requirements] apply here.  One that doesn't is the bi-
   directional requirement.  Even so, the same security and transport
   design used for DOTS should be used here.

5.  first MILE data model

   The data model will support the constraints of the NETCONF
   publication/subscription model [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push], and the
   NETCONF module library function [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-library] which
   indicates pub/sub support within a model.  If the MILE service which
   to utilize non-persistent (aka ephemeral) data that disappears on
   reboot, the netconf publication/subscription model will support non-
   persistent configuration.

   Work on the data model is an open item.

6.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA considerations exist for this document at this time.

7.  Security Considerations

   An attacker that can disable first MILE may be able to attack a
   device at will as those monitoring it expect these attacks to show up
   on their monitor.  As such each part of the firstMILE system will
   need the complete security services that are defined or referenced
   here.
