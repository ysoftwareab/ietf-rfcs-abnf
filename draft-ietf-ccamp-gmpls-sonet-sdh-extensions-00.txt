Abstract 
    
   This document is a companion to the GMPLS signaling extensions to 
   control SONET and SDH document [GMPLS-SONET-SDH] that defines the 
   SONET/SDH technology specific information needed when using GMPLS 
   signaling. 
    
   This informational document defines GMPLS signaling extensions to 
   control three optional non-standard (i.e. proprietary) SONET and 
   SDH features: arbitrary concatenation, per byte transparency and 
   the virtual concatenation of contiguously concatenated signals. 
    
    
1. Introduction 
    
   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) [GMPLS-ARCH] extends MPLS from supporting 
   packet (Packet Switching Capable - PSC) interfaces and switching 
   to include support of three new classes of interfaces and 
   switching: Time-Division Multiplex (TDM), Lambda Switch (LSC) and 
   Fiber-Switch (FSC). 
    
   A functional description of the extensions to MPLS signaling 
   needed to support the new classes of interfaces and switching is 
   provided in [GMPLS-SIG]. [GMPLS-RSVP] describes RSVP-TE specific 
   formats and mechanisms needed to support all four classes of 
   interfaces, and CR-LDP extensions can be found in [GMPLS-LDP].  
    
   [GMPLS-SONET-SDH] presents details that are specific to SONET/SDH. 
   Per [GMPLS-SIG], SONET/SDH specific parameters are carried in the 
   signaling protocol in traffic parameter specific objects. 
    
   This informational document defines GMPLS signaling extensions to 
   control three optional non-standard (i.e. proprietary) SONET and 
   SDH features: arbitrary concatenation (section 2), per byte 
   transparency (section 3) and the virtual concatenation of 
   contiguously concatenated signals (section 4). Section 5 gives 
   examples of SONET/SDH traffic parameters (also referred to as 
   signal coding) when requesting a SDH/SONET LSP. 
    
   Such useful features are already implemented or under develoment 
   by a significant number of manufacturers. For instance, arbitrary 
   concatenation is already implemented in many legacy SONET and SDH 
   equipment that don't support any byte-oriented protocol based 
   control plane. 
    
   This document doesn't specify how to implement these features in 
   the transmission plane but how to control their usage with a GMPLS 
   control plane.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" 
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 
 
 
2. Contiguous Concatenation Extension 
    
   This section defines the following optional extension flag for the 
   Requested Contiguous Concatenation (RCC) field defined in section 
   2.1 of [GMPLS-SONET-SDH]: 
    
      Flag 2 (bit 2): Arbitrary contiguous concatenation. 
    
   This flag allows an upstream node to signal to a downstream node 
   that it supports arbitrary contiguous concatenation. This type of 
   concatenation is not defined by ANSI or ITU-T. 
    
   Arbitrary contiguous concatenation allows for any value of X (X 
   less or equal N) in VC-4-X/STS-X resulting in a VC-4-Xa/STS-Xa 
   signal. In addition, it allows the arbitrary contiguous 
   concatenated signal to start at any location (AU-4/STS-1 timeslot) 
   in the STM-N/STS-N signal. 
    
   This flag can be setup together with Flag 1 (Standard Contiguous 
   Concatenation) to give a choice to the downstream node. The 
   resulting type of contiguous concatenation can be different at 
   each hop according to the result of the negotiation. 
    
   A label is assigned following the same rule as for the Standard 
   Contiguous Concatenation (see [GMPLS-SONET-SDH]). 
 
 
3. Transparency Extension 
    
   This section defines the following optional extension for the 
   Transparency field defined in section 2.1 of [GMPLS-SONET-SDH]. 
    
  This "extended" transparency (simply referred here as 
  transparency) can be requested for a particular SOH/RSOH or 
  MSOH/LOH field in the STM-N/STS-N signal. 
   
  Transparency is not applied at the interfaces of the initiating 
  and terminating LSRs, but is only applied between intermediate 
  LSRs. Moreover, the transparency extensions can be implemented 
  effectively in very different ways, e.g. by forwarding the 
  corresponding overhead bytes unmodified, or by tunneling the 
  bytes.  
   
  This specification specifies neither how transparency is achieved; 
  nor the behavior of the signal at the egress of the transparent 
  network during fault conditions at the ingress of the transparent 
  network or within the transparent network; nor network deployment 
  scenarios. The signaling is independent of these considerations.

  draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-sonet-sdh-extensions-00.txt  October, 2001 

   
  When the signaling is used between intermediate nodes it is up to 
  a data plane profile or specification to indicate how transparency 
  is effectively achieved in the data plane. When the signaling is 
  used at the interfaces with the initiating and terminating LSRs it 
  is up to the data plane specification to guarantee compliant 
  behavior to G.707/T1.105 under fault free and fault conditions. 
   
  Note that B1 in the SOH/RSOH is computed over the complete 
  previous frame, if one bit changes, B1 must be re-computed. Note 
  that B2 in the LOH/MSOH is also computed over the complete 
  previous frame, except the SOH/RSOH. 
   
  The different transparency extension flags are the following: 
        
       Flag 3  (bit 3) : J0. 
       Flag 4  (bit 4) : SOH/RSOH DCC (D1-D3). 
       Flag 5  (bit 5) : LOH/MSOH DCC (D4-D12). 
       Flag 6  (bit 6) : LOH/MSOH Extended DCC (D13-D156). 
       Flag 7  (bit 7) : K1/K2. 
       Flag 8  (bit 8) : E1. 
       Flag 9  (bit 9) : F1. 
       Flag 10 (bit 10): E2. 
       Flag 11 (bit 11): B1. 
       Flag 12 (bit 12): B2. 
   
  Line/Multiplex Section layer transparency (refer to section 2.1 of 
  [GMPLS-SONET-SDH]) can be combined only with any of the following 
  transparency types: J0, SOH/RSOH DCC (D1-D3), E1, F1; and all 
  other transparency flags must be ignored. 
   
  Note that the extended LOH/MSOH DCC (D13-D156) is only applicable 
  to (defined for) STS-768/STM-256. 
    
   If B1 transparency is requested, this means transparency for the bit 
   error supervision functionality provided by the B1. The B1 contains 
   the BIP8 calculated over the previous RS/Section frame of the STM-
   N/STS-N signal at the RS/Section termination source. At the 
   RS/Section termination sink the B1 BIP is compared with the local 
   BIP also calculated over the previous RS/Section frame of the STM-
   N/STS-N. Any difference between the two BIP values is an indication 
   for a bit error that occurred between the termination source and 
   sink. In case of B1 transparency this functionality shall be 
   preserved. This means that a B1 bit error detection as described 
   above performed after the transparent transport (at a RS/Section 
   termination sink) indicates exactly the bit errors that occur 
   between the B1 insertion point (RS/Section termination source) and 
   this point. Any intended changes to the previous RS/Section frame 
   content due to the implementation of the transparency feature (e.g. 
   modifications of the RS/Section overhead, modifications of the 
   payload due to pointer justifications) have to be reflected in the 
   B1 BIP value, it has to be adjusted accordingly.

   If B2 transparency is requested, this means transparency for the bit 
   error supervision functionality provided by the B2. The B2 contains 
   the BIP24*N/BIP8*N calculated over the previous MS/Line frame of the 
   STM-N/STS-N signal at the MS/Line termination source. At the MS/Line 
   termination sink the B2 BIP is compared with the local BIP also 
   calculated over the previous MS/Line frame of the STM-N/STS-N. Any 
   difference between the two BIP values is an indication for a bit 
   error that occurred between the termination source and sink. In case 
   of B2 transparency this functionality shall be preserved. This means 
   that a B2 bit error detection as described above performed after the 
   transparent transport (at a MS/Line termination sink) indicates 
   exactly the bit errors that occur between the B2 insertion point 
   (MS/Line termination source) and this point. Any intended changes to 
   the previous MS/Line frame content due to the implementation of the 
   transparency feature (e.g. modifications of the MS/Line overhead, 
   modifications of the payload due to pointer justifications) have to 
   be reflected in the B2 BIP value, it has to be adjusted accordingly.  
 
 
4. Virtual Concatenation Extension 
    
   This section defines the following optional extension for the 
   signals that can be virtually concatenated. 
    
   In addition to the elementary signal types, which can be virtual 
   concatenated as indicated in section 2.1 of [GMPLS-SONET-SDH], 
   identical contiguously concatenated signals may be virtual 
   concatenated. In this last case, it allows to request the virtual 
   concatenation of, for instance, several VC-4-4c/STS-12c SPEs (i.e. 
   per [GMPLS-SONET-SDH] (STS-3c)-4c SPE), or any VC-4-Xc/STS-Xc SPEs 
   to obtain a VC-4-Xc-Yv/STS-Xc-Yv SPE. 
    
   Note that the standard definition for virtual concatenation allows 
   each virtual concatenation components to travel over diverse 
   paths. Within GMPLS, virtual concatenation components must travel 
   over the same (component) link if they are part of the same LSP. 
   This is due to the way that labels are bound to a (component) 
   link. Note however, that the routing of components on different 
   paths is indeed equivalent to establishing different LSPs, each 
   one having its own route. Several LSPs can be initiated and 
   terminated between the same nodes and their corresponding 
   components can then be associated together (i.e. virtually 
   concatenated). 
 
   In case of virtual concatenation of a contiguously concatenated 
   signal, the same rule as described in section 3 of [GMPLS-SONET-
   SD] for virtual concatenation applies, except that a component of 
   the virtually concatenated signal is now a contiguously 
   concatenated signal. The first label indicates the first 
   contiguously concatenated signal; the second label indicates the 
   second contiguously concatenated signal, and so on.

5. Examples 
    
   This section defines examples of SONET and SDH signal coding. Their 
   objective is to help the reader to understand how works the traffic 
   parameter coding and not to give examples of typical SONET or SDH 
   signals. 
    
   As stated in [GMPLS_SONET_SDH], signal types are Elementary 
   Signals to which successive concatenation, multiplication and 
   transparency transforms can be applied. 
    
   1. An STM-64 signal with RSOH and MSOH DCCs transparency is formed 
   by the application of RCC with value 0, NCC with value 0, NVC with 
   value 0, MT with value 1 and T with flag 4 and 5 to an STM-64 
   Elementary Signal. 
 
   2. An STS-192 signal with K1/K2 and LOH DCC transparency is formed 
   by the application of RCC with value 0, NVC with value 0, MT with 
   value 1 and T with flags 5 and 7 to an STS-192 Elementary Signal. 
    
   3. An STS-48c signal with LOH DCC and E2 transparency is formed by 
   the application of RCC with flag 1, NCC with value 1, NVC with 
   value 0, MT with value 1 and T with flag 5 and 10 to an STS-48 
   Elementary Signal. 
    
   4. An STS-768c signal with K1/K2 and LOH DCC transparency is 
   formed by the application of RCC with flag 1, NCC with value 1, 
   NVC with value 0, MT with value 1 and T with flag 5 and 7 to an 
   STS-768 Elementary Signal. 
    
   5. 4 x STS-12 signals with K1/K2 and LOH DCC transparency is 
   formed by the application of RCC with value 0, NVC with value 0, 
   MT with value 4 and T with flags 5 and 7 to an STS-12 Elementary 
   Signal. 
 
   6. 2 x STS-4a-5v SPE signal is formed by the application of RCC 
   with flag 2 (for arbitrary contiguous concatenation), NCC with 
   value 4, NVC with value 5, MT with value 2 and T with value 0 to 
   an STS-1 SPE Elementary Signal. 
 
   7. A VC-4-3a signal is formed by the application of RCC with flag 
   2 (arbitrary contiguous concatenation), NCC with value 3, NVC with 
   value 0, MT with value 1 and T with value 0 to a VC-4 Elementary 
   Signal. 
    
   8. An STS-34a SPE signal is formed by the application of RCC with 
   flag 2 (arbitrary contiguous concatenation), NCC with value 34, 
   NVC with value 0, MT with value 1 and T with value 0 to an STS-1 
   SPE Elementary Signal.
