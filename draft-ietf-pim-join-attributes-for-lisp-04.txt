               PIM Join Attributes for LISP Environments
             draft-ietf-pim-join-attributes-for-lisp-04.txt

Abstract

   This document defines two PIM Join/Prune attributes that support the
   construction of multicast distribution trees where the root and
   receivers are located in different LISP sites.  These attributes
   allow the receiver site to select between unicast and multicast
   underlay transport and to convey the receiver ETR's RLOC address to
   the control plane of the root ITR.

1.  Introduction

   The construction of multicast distribution trees where the root and
   receivers are located in different LISP sites [RFC6830] is defined in
   [RFC6831].  Creation of (root-EID,G) state in the root site requires
   that unicast LISP-encapsulated Join/Prune messages be sent from an
   ETR on the receiver site to an ITR on the root site.

   [RFC6831] specifies that (root-EID,G) data packets are to be LISP-
   encapsulated into (root-RLOC,G) multicast packets.  However, a wide
   deployment of multicast connectivity between LISP sites is unlikely
   to happen any time soon.  In fact, some implementations are initially
   focusing on unicast transport with head-end replication between root
   and receiver sites.

   The unicast LISP-encapsulated Join/Prune message specifies the (root-
   EID,G) state that needs to be established in the root site, but
   conveys nothing about the receivers capability or desire to use
   multicast as the underlying transport.  This document specifies a
   Join/Prune attribute that allows the receiver ETR to select the
   desired transport.

   Knowledge of the receiver ETR's RLOC address is also essential to the
   control plane of the root ITR.  It determines the downstream
   destination for unicast head-end replication and identifies the

   receiver ETR that needs to be notified should the root of the
   distribution tree move to another site.

   Service providers may implement URPF policies requiring that the
   outer source address of the LISP-encapsulated Join/Prune message be
   the address of the receiver ETR's core-facing interface used to
   physically transmit the message.  However, due to policy and load
   balancing considerations, the outer source address may not be the
   RLOC on which the receiver site wishes to receive a particular flow.
   This document specifies a Join/Prune attribute that conveys the
   appropriate receiver ETR's RLOC address to the control plane of the
   root ITR.

2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  PIM Join/Prune Attributes

   PIM Join/Prune attributes are defined in [RFC5384] by introducing a
   new Encoded-Source type that, in addition to the Join/Prune source,
   can carry multiple type-length-value (TLV) attributes.  These
   attributes apply to the individual Join/Prune sources on which they
   are stored.

   The attributes defined in this document conform to the format of the
   encoding type defined in [RFC5384].  The attributes would typically
   be the same for all the sources in the Join/Prune message.  Hence we
   RECOMMEND using the hierarchical Join/Prune attribute scheme defined
   in [I-D.ietf-pim-hierarchicaljoinattr].  This hirarchichal system
   allows attributes to be conveyed on the Upstream Neighbor Address
   field, thus enabling the efficient application of a single attribute
   instance to all the sources in the Join/Prune message.

   LISP xTRs do not exchange PIM Hello Messages and hence no Hello
   option is defined to negotiate support for these attributes.  Systems
   that support unicast head-end replication are assumed to support
   these attributes.

4.  The Transport Attribute

   It is essential that a mechanism be provided by which the desired
   transport can be conveyed by receiver sites.  Root sites with
   multicast connectivity will want to leverage multicast replication.
   However, not all receiver sites can be expected to have multicast
   connectivity.  It is thus desirable that root sites be prepared to

   support (root-EID,G) state with a mixture of multicast and unicast
   output state.  This document specifies a Join/Prune attribute that
   allows the receiver to select the desired underlying transport.

4.1.  Transport Attribute Format


          0                   1                   2
          0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |F|E| Type = TBD| Length = 1    |  Transport    |
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   F-bit:   The Transitive bit.  Specifies whether the attribute is
      transitive or non-transitive.  MUST be set to zero.  This
      attribute is ALWAYS non-transitive.

   E-bit:   End-of-Attributes bit.  Specifies whether this attribute is
      the last.  Set to zero if there are more attributes.  Set to 1 if
      this is the last attribute.

   Type:   The Transport Attribute type is TBD.

   Length:   The length of the Transport Attribute value.  MUST be set
      to 1.

   Transport:   The type of transport being requested.  Set to 0 for
      multicast.  Set to 1 for unicast.

4.2.  Using the Transport Attribute

   Hierarchical Join/Prune attribute instances
   [I-D.ietf-pim-hierarchicaljoinattr] SHOULD be used when the same
   Transport Attribute is to be applied to all the sources within the
   Join/Prune message or all the sources within a group set.  The root
   ITR MUST accept Transport Attributes in the Upstream Neighbor
   Encoded-Unicast address, Encoded-Group addresses, and Encoded-Source
   addresses.

   There MUST NOT be more than one Transport Attribute within the same
   encoded address.  If an encoded address has more than one instance of
   the attribute, the root ITR MUST discard all affected Join/Prune
   sources.

5.  Receiver ETR RLOC Attribute

   When a receiver ETR requests unicast head-end replication for a given
   (root-EID,G) entry, the PIM control plane of the root ITR must
   maintain an output interface list ("oif-list") entry for the receiver
   ETR and its corresponding RLOC address.  This allows the root ITR to
   perform unicast LISP-encapsulation of multicast data packets to each
   and every receiver ETR that has requested unicast head-end
   replication.

   The PIM control plane of the root ITR could potentially determine the
   RLOC address of the receiver ETR from the outer source address field
   of LISP-encapsulated Join/Prune message.  However, receiver ETRs are
   subject to URPF checks by the network providers on each core-facing
   interface.  The outer source address must therefore be the RLOC of
   the core-facing interface used to physically transmit the LISP-
   encapsulated Join/Prune message.  Due to policy and load balancing
   considerations, that may not be the RLOC on which the receiver site
   wishes to receive a particular flow.  This document specifies a Join/
   Prune attribute that conveys the appropriate receiver RLOC address to
   the PIM control plane of the root ITR.

   To support root-EID mobility, receiver ETRs must also be tracked by
   the LISP control plane of the root ITR, regardless of the underlying
   transport.  When the root-EID moves to a new root ITR in a different
   LISP site, the receiver ETRs do not know the root-EID has moved and
   therefore do not know the RLOC of the new root ITR.  This is true for
   both unicast and multicast transport modes.  The new root ITR does
   not have any receiver ETR state.  Therefore, it is the responsability
   of the old root ITR to inform the receiver ETRs that the root-EID has
   moved.  When the old root ITR detects that the root-EID has moved, it
   sends a LISP SMR message to each receiver ETR.  The receiver ETRs do
   a mapping database lookup to retrieve the RLOC of the new root ITR.
   The old root ITR detects that the root-EID has moved when it receives
   a Map-Notify from the Map-Server.  The transmission of the Map-Notify
   is triggered when the new root ITR registers the root-EID
   [I-D.portoles-lisp-eid-mobility].  When a receiver ETR determines
   that the root ITR has changed it will send a LISP-encapsulated PIM
   prune message to the old root XTR and a LISP-encapsulated PIM join
   message to the new root XTR.

      in [RFC4601].

   Receiver RLOC:   The RLOC address on which the receiver ETR wishes to
      receiver the unicast-encapsulated flow.">

5.2.  Using the Receiver RLOC Attribute

   Hierarchical Join/Prune attribute instances
   [I-D.ietf-pim-hierarchicaljoinattr] SHOULD be used when the same
   Receiver RLOC attribute is to be applied to all the sources within
   the message or all the sources within a group set.  The root ITR MUST
   accept Transport Attributes in the Upstream Neighbor Encoded-Unicast
   address, Encoded-Group addresses, and Encoded-Source addresses.

   There MUST NOT be more than one Receiver RLOC Attribute within the
   same encoded address.  If an encoded address has more than one
   instance of the attribute, the root ITR MUST discard all affected
   Join/Prune sources.

6.  Security Considerations

   Security of the Join Attribute is only guaranteed by the security of
   the PIM packet.  The attributes specified herein do not enhance or
   diminish the privacy or authenticity of a Join/Prune message.  A site
   that legitimately or maliciously sends and delivers a Join/Prune

   message to another site will equally be able to append these and any
   other attributes it wishes.

7.  IANA Considerations

   Two new PIM Join/Prune attribute types need to be assigned.  Type 5
   is being requested for the Transport Attribute.  Type 6 is being
   requested for the Receiver RLOC Attribute.
