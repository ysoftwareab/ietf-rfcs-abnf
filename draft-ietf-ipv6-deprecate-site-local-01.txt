Abstract
   
   This document describes the issues surrounding the use of IPv6 site-
   local unicast addresses in their original form, and formally
   deprecates them. This deprecation does not prevent their continued
   use until a replacement has been standardized and implemented.
   
1	Introduction
   
   For some time, the IPv6 working group has been debating a set of
   issues surrounding the use of "site local" addresses. In its meeting
   in March 2003, the group reached a measure of agreement that these
   issues were serious enough to warrant a replacement of site local
   addresses in their original form. Although the consensus was far
   from unanimous, the working group confirmed in its meeting in July
   2003 the need to document these issues and the consequent decision
   to deprecate IPv6 site-local unicast addresses.
   
   Site-local addresses are defined in the IPv6 addressing architecture
   [RFC3513], especially in section 2.5.6.
   
   The remainder of this document describes the adverse effects of
   site-local addresses according to the above definition, and formally
   deprecates them.

   Companion documents will describe the goals of a replacement
   solution [Hain/Templin] and specify a replacement solution
   [Hinden/Haberman]. However, the formal deprecation allows existing
   usage of site-local addresses to continue until the replacement is
   standardized and implemented.
   
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
   
2	Adverse effects of site local addresses
   
   Discussions in the IPv6 working group outlined several defects of
   the current site local addressing scope. These defects fall in two
   broad categories: ambiguity of addresses, and fuzzy definition of
   sites.
   
   As currently defined, site local addresses are ambiguous: an address
   such as FEC0::1 can be present in multiple sites, and the address
   itself does not contain any indication of the site to which it
   belongs. This creates pain for developers of applications, for the
   designers of routers and for the network managers. This pain is
   compounded by the fuzzy nature of the site concept. We will develop
   the specific nature of this pain in the following section.
   
2.1	Developer pain
   
   Early feedback from developers indicates that site local addresses
   are hard to use correctly in an application. This is particularly
   true for multi-homed hosts, which can be simultaneously connected to
   multiple sites, and for mobile hosts, which can be successively
   connected to multiple sites.
   
   Applications would learn or remember that the address of some
   correspondent was "FEC0::1234:5678:9ABC", they would try to feed the
   address in a socket address structure and issue a connect, and the
   call will fail because they did not fill up the "site identifier"
   variable, as in "FEC0::1234:5678:9ABC&1". The problem is compounded
   by the fact that the site identifier varies with the host
   instantiation, e.g. sometimes &1 and sometimes &2, and thus that the
   host identifier cannot be remembered in memory, or learned from a
   name server.
   
   In short, the developer pain is caused by the ambiguity of site
   local addresses. Since site-local addresses are ambiguous,
   application developers have to manage the "site identifiers" that
   qualify the addresses of the hosts. This management of identifiers
   has proven hard to understand by developers, and also hard to
   execute by those developers who understand the concept.
   
2.2	Manager pain, leaks

INTERNET DRAFT   Deprecating Site Local Addresses     October 13, 2003

   The management of IPv6 site local addresses is in many ways similar
   to the management of RFC 1918 [RFC1918] addresses in some IPv4
   networks. In theory, the private addresses defined in RFC 1918
   should only be used locally, and should never appear in the
   Internet. In practice, these addresses "leak". The conjunction of
   leaks and ambiguity ends up causing management problems.
   
   Names and literal addresses of "private" hosts leak in mail
   messages, web pages, or files. Private addresses end up being used
   as source or destination of TCP requests or UDP messages, for
   example in DNS or trace-route requests, causing the request to fail,
   or the response to arrive at unsuspecting hosts.
   
   The experience with RFC1918 addresses also shows some non trivial
   leaks, besides pacing these addresses in IP headers. Private
   addresses also end up being used as targets of reverse DNS queries
   for RFC1918, uselessly overloading the DNS infrastructure. In
   general, many applications that use IP addresses directly end up
   passing RFC1918 addresses in application payloads, creating
   confusion and failures.
   
   The leakage issue is largely unavoidable. While some applications
   are intrinsically scoped (eg. Router Advertisement, Neighbor
   Discovery), most applications have no concept of scope, and no way
   of expressing scope. As a result, "stuff leaks across the borders".
   Since the addresses are ambiguous, the network managers cannot
   easily find out "who did it". Leaks are thus hard to fix, resulting
   in a lot of frustration.
   
2.3	Router pain, routing tables
   
   The ambiguity of site local addresses also creates problems for the
   routers. In theory, site local addresses are only used within a
   contiguous site, and all routers in that site can treat them as if
   they were not ambiguous. In practice, problem occurs when sites are
   disjoint, or when routers have to handle several sites.
   
   In theory, sites should never be disjoint. In practice, if site
   local addressing is used throughout a large network, some elements
   of the site will not be directly connected. This will create a
   demand to route the site-local packets across some intermediate
   network. In practice, this leads to an extensive use of tunneling
   techniques, or the use of multi-sited routers, or both.
   
   Ambiguous addresses have fairly obvious consequences on multi-sited
   routers. In classic router architecture, the exit interface is a
   direct function of the destination address, as specified by a single
   routing table. However, if a router is connected to multiple sites,
   the routing of site local packets depends on the interface on which
   the packet arrived. Interfaces have to be associated to sites, and
   the routing entries for the site local addresses are site-dependent.
   The route management software and the routing protocols have to

Carpenter, Huitema.                                          [Page  3]

INTERNET DRAFT   Deprecating Site Local Addresses     October 13, 2003

   account for the site boundaries. This can be particularly hard to do
   when sites are adjacent or overlap.
   
   In multi-homed routers, such as for example site border routers, the
   routing process should be complemented by a filtering process, to
   guarantee that packets sourced with a site local address never leave
   the site. This filtering process will in turn interact with the
   routing of packets, as it may cause the drop of packets sent to a
   global address, even if that global address happen to belong to the
   target site.
   
   In summary, the ambiguity of site local addresses makes them hard to
   manage in multi-sited routers, while the requirement to support
   disjoint sites creates a demand for such routers.
   
2.4	Site is an ill-defined concept
   
   The current definition of scopes follows an idealized "concentric
   scopes" model. Hosts are supposed to be attached to a link, which
   belongs to a site, which belongs to the Internet. Packets could be
   sent to the same link, the same site, or outside that site. However,
   experts have been arguing about the definition of sites for years
   and have reached no sort of consensus. That suggests that there is
   in fact no consensus to be reached.
   
   Apart from link-local, scope boundaries are ill-defined. What is a
   site? Is the whole of a corporate network a site, or are sites
   limited to single geographic locations? Many networks today are
   split between an internal area and an outside facing "DMZ",
   separated by a firewall. Servers in the DMZ are supposedly
   accessible by both the internal hosts and external hosts on the
   Internet. Does the DMZ belong to the same site as the internal host?
   
   Depending on whom we ask, the definition of the site scope varies.
   It may map security boundaries, reachability boundaries, routing
   boundaries, QOS boundaries, administrative boundaries, funding
   boundaries, some other kinds of boundaries, or a combination of
   these. It is very unclear that a single scope could satisfy all
   these requirements.
   
   There are some well known and important scope-breaking phenomena,
   such as intermittently connected networks, mobile nodes, mobile
   networks, inter-domain VPNs, hosted networks, network merges and
   splits, etc. Specifically, this means that scope *cannot* be mapped
   into concentric circles such as a naive link/local/global model.
   Scopes overlap and extend into one another. The scope relationship
   between two hosts may even be different for different protocols.
   
   In summary, the current concept of site is naive, and does not map
   operational requirements.
   
3	Development of a better alternative

Carpenter, Huitema.                                          [Page  4]

INTERNET DRAFT   Deprecating Site Local Addresses     October 13, 2003

   The previous section reviewed the arguments against site-local
   addresses. Obviously, site locals also have some benefits, without
   which they would have been removed from the specification long ago.
   The perceived benefits of site local are that they are simple,
   stable, and private [Hain/Templin]. However, it appears that these
   benefits can be also obtained with an alternative architecture, for
   example [Hinden/Haberman], in which addresses are not ambiguous and
   do not have a simple explicit scope.
   
   Having non-ambiguous address solves a large part of the developers'
   pain, as it removes the need to manage site identifiers. The
   application can use the addresses as if they were regular global
   addresses, and the stack will be able to use standard techniques to
   discover which interface should be used. Some level of pain will
   remain, as these addresses will not always be reachable; however,
   applications can deal with the un-reachability issues by trying
   connections at a different time, or with a different address.
   Speculatively, a more sophisticated scope mechanism might be
   introduced at a later date.
   
   Having non ambiguous addresses will not eliminate the leaks that
   cause management pain. However, since the addresses are not
   ambiguous, debugging these leaks will be much simpler.
   
   Having non ambiguous addresses will solve a large part of the router
   issues: since addresses are not ambiguous, routers will be able to
   use standard routing techniques, and will not need different routing
   tables for each interface. Some of the pain will remain at border
   routers, which will need to filter packets from some ranges of
   source addresses; this is however a fairly common function.
   
   Avoiding the explicit declaration of scope will remove the issues
   linked to the ambiguity of the site concept. Non-reachability can be
   obtained by using "firewalls" where appropriate. The firewall rules
   can explicitly accommodate various network configurations, by
   accepting of refusing traffic to and from ranges of the new non-
   ambiguous addresses.
   
   One question remains, anycast addressing. Anycast addresses are
   ambiguous by construction, since they refer by definition to any
   host that has been assigned a given anycast address. Link-local or
   global anycast addresses can be"baked in the code". Further study is
   required on the need for anycast addresses with scope between link-
   local and global.
   
4	Deprecation
   
   This document formally deprecates the IPv6 site-local unicast prefix
   defined in [RFC3513], i.e. 1111111011 binary or FEC0::/10. The
   special behavior of this prefix MUST no longer be supported in new
   implementations. The prefix MUST NOT be reassigned for other use

   except by a future IETF standards action. Future versions of the
   addressing architecture [RFC3513] will include this information.
   
   However, router implementations SHOULD be configured to prevent
   routing of this prefix by default.
   
   Existing implementations and deployments MAY continue to use this
   prefix.
   
5	Security Considerations
   
   The site-local unicast prefix allows for some blocking action in
   firewall rules and address selection rules, which are commonly
   viewed as a security feature since they prevent packets crossing
   administrative boundaries. Such blocking rules can be configured for
   any prefix, including the expected future replacement for the site-
   local prefix. If these blocking rules are actually enforced, the
   deprecation of the site-local prefix does not endanger security.
   
6	IANA Considerations
   
   IANA is specifically requested not to reassign the 1111111011 binary
   or FEC0::/10 prefix unless requested to do so by a future IETF
   standards action.
