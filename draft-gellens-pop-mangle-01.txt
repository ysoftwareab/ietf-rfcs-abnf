Abstract
    
    This document describes two extensions to the POP protocol that have
    been supported for several years by some client and servers.  One
    extension, MANGLE, allows clients to request that MIME body parts be
    removed or converted to a simpler format, that only selected headers
    be transmitted, and/or to for the message to be transcoded to a
    different character set.  The other extension, MACRO, allows clients
    to define macros which are expanded when used, saving repetitive
    transmissions.

    These extensions have been useful in at least two situations: they
    allow clients on constrained devices to avoid downloading body parts
    which cannot be used on the device, and clients which use the TOP
    command to "peek" at messages can have the preview transformed into
    more usable content, as well as avoiding the transmission of
    undesired headers.

2.  Introduction
    
    Since May of 2000, the Qpopper open-source POP server has supported
    the MIME mangling (MANGLE) and macro (MACRO) extensions to the
    [POP3] protocol.
    
    These extensions have been useful in at least two situations:
    
    o    clients on constrained devices can avoid downloading body parts
    which cannot be used on the device, can have the content transcoded
    into a more desirable character set, and can have undesired headers
    removed prior to transmission; and
    
    o    clients which use the TOP command to "peek" at messages can
    have the preview transformed into more usable content, and can make
    the preview more useful by eliminating extraneous headers.
    
    The Eudora for PalmOS client (part of the Eudora Internet Suite for
    PalmOS) makes use of both extensions.
    
    The Eudora clients for both MacOS and Windows make use of the MANGLE
    extension when using the TOP command.

    With the prevalence of attachments and formatted mail, these
    extensions have been useful in solving the following problems:
    
    o    clients on constrained devices or links often download
    attachments that waste bandwidth and must be parsed and discarded,
    since they cannot be used on the device;
    
    o    clients on slow links or memory-limited devices waste bandwidth
    receiving undesired headers;
    
    o    when the TOP command is used to "peek" at messages, especially
    when using a bandwidth-constrained connection (such as a non-3G
    mobile link or a slow dialup with a laptop), often the captured
    portion of the message is unreadable, being a mess of HTML tags
    (since many clients show these previews in their raw form, and,
    being truncated, the HTML may not be syntactically valid and hence
    difficult for the client to parse).
    
    Obviously, IMAP [IMAP] provides a more feature-packed protocol and
    hence allows for a richer user experience.  However, IMAP also
    imposes significant additional costs on server operators (for
    example, since with IMAP the server maintains the authoritative mail
    store, the storage requirements are typically much greater than with
    POP).  In general, the extra costs of IMAP are far outweighed by the
    additional benefits, and hence IMAP is the recommended mechanism for
    greater functionality, but there are cases where the extra costs
    cannot be justified or recovered.  In those cases, minor extensions
    to POP to provide additional value to mobile devices may be a useful
    interim measure until IMAP can be deployed.
    
    
3.  MIME Mangling (MANGLE)
    
    This extension is announced by including MANGLE in the CAPA
    [POP-EXT] response.
    
    The MANGLE extension can be used as a modifier to the TOP, RETR, and
    LIST commands.  The result is to:
    
    o    Remove MIME body parts
    o   Optionally remove all headers except those requested
    o   Optionally encode in a specified character set
        
    The syntax is:
    
    mangle      =   "mangle(" mangling ")"
    mangling    =   attribute "=" value *(";" attribute "=" value )
    attribute   =   "text" / "headers" / "charset" / "lang" / "wrap"
    value       =   text-type / header-list / charset

Internet Draft                Mangle and Macro                July 2007


    text-type   =   "plain" / "html" / "enriched"
    header-list =   header *("," header)
    charset     =   "us-ascii" / iso-8859-r / "utf-8" / "cp1252" /
                    "iso_2022-jp"
    iso-8859-r  =   "iso-8859-" range
    range       =   "1"-"15"
    
    The following command results in transmitting message 10 as a single
    part of content-type text/html with only those headers which were
    requested:
    
        retr 10 mangle(text=html;headers=to:,cc:,from:,date:)
    
    The following command asks the server for the size of message 2
    after mangling as a single part of content-type text/html with only
    those headers which were requested:
    
        list 2 mangle(text=html;headers=to:,cc:,from:,date:)
    
    The message can be sent as one of three text types: text/plain,
    text/html, and text/enriched.  The source format can be any of these
    types or text/plain;format=flowed.
    
    If the headers are not specified, the default is to return the
    following ones: "to:", "cc:", "subject:", "from:", "date:",
    "reply-to:", "x-Priority:", and "x-UIDL:".
    
    Note that "lang" and "wrap" are currently ignored.
    
    The value supplied with the "headers" attribute is a comma-separated
    list of desired headers.  Header in the message are matched up to
    what is entered, so "headers=sub" will cause both the "Subject:" and
    "Subversive:" headers to be returned, if both exist in the message.
    In order to be sure to match only the exact header desired, clients
    may wish to include the ":".  The "Mime-Version:" and
    "Content-Type:" headers are always included, and reflect the
    mangling that has been applied.
    
    Note that there must not be any spaces within the 'mangle' string
    (since spaces are used to separate parameters to POP commands).
    
    Case is not significant with the MANGLE extension.
    'mangle(text=plain)' is the same as 'mAnglE(TeXT=PLaiN)',
    'headers=to' is the same as 'headers=TO'.
    
    Examples:
    
    top 1 100 mangle(text=plain;headers=to:,subject:)
    retr 1 mangle(text=plain;headers=to:,subject:)

    retr 1 mangle(text=plain;charset=us-ascii;headers=to:,subject:)
    list mangle(text=plain;charset=us-ascii;headers=to:,subject:)
    list 1 mangle(text=plain;charset=us-ascii;headers=to:,subject:)
    
    Examples of use:
    
    The client retrieves message 1 as it exists in the message store:
    
    C: retr 1
    S: +OK 665 octets
    S: Received: from foo.example.net (localhost [127.0.0.1])
    S:         by hotearth.example.net (8.12.10/8.12.3/1.0) with
    S:         ESMTP id j3L0Lq9B014701
    S:         for <poptest8@hotearth.example.net>; 
    S:         Wed, 20 Apr 2005 17:21:52 -0700 (PDT)
    S: Received: (from randy@localhost)
    S:         by hotearth.example.net (8.12.10/8.12.1/Submit) id
    S:         j3L0Lqqj014700 for poptest8; 
    S:         Wed, 20 Apr 2005 17:21:52 -0700 (PDT)
    S: Date: Wed, 20 Apr 2005 17:21:52 -0700 (PDT)
    S: From: Randall Gellens <randy@example.net>
    S: Message-Id: <200504210021.j3L0Lqqj014700@hotearth.example.net>
    S: To: poptest8@example.net
    S: Subject: test #1
    S: X-UIDL: o=6"!2HZ!!LR+!!7C!"!
    S: Status: RO
    S: 
    S: This is a test.
    S: .
    
    The client retrieves message 1 as text/html and with only those
    headers which start with 'foo' (in this case, none):
    
    C: retr 1 mangle(text=html;headers=foo)
    S: +OK Message follows
    S: Mime-version: 1.0
    S: Content-Type: text/html;charset="us-ascii"
    S: 
    S: <html><pre>This is a test.
    S: </pre></html>
    S: .
    
    Note that some servers (such as Qpopper) also support the "-no-mime"
    user name hack.  As a way to enable MIME-mangling with clients that
    do not implement MANGLE, add "-no-mime" to the user name.  For
    example, if the userid is "mary", enter it in the client as
    "mary-no-mime".

3.1.  MANGLE Capability
    
    CAPA tag:
        MANGLE
        
    Arguments:
        none
        
    Added commands:
        none
        
    Standard commands affected:
        TOP, RETR, LIST
        
    Announced states / possible differences:
        both / no
        
    Commands valid in states:

    Specification reference:
        This document
        
    Discussion:
        The MANGLE capability indicates the optional MANGLE parameter is
        available for use with the TOP, RETR, and LIST commands.  See
        Section 3 for the details of the MANGLE parameter.
    
    
4.  Macro Definition (MDEF)
    
    This extension is announced by including MACRO in the CAPA [POP-EXT]
    response.
    
    The client uses the MDEF command to define a macro.  The server may
    impose limits on the length of the macro name and/or value and the
    number of macros.  In the case of Qpopper, the macro (name and value
    plus parenthesis) must be no greater than 500 octets (100 in older
    versions of the server), and clients may define up to ten macros.
    
    Redefining a macro of the same name is permitted; the new macro
    replaces the old one.
    
    Syntax:
    
    macro       = "MDEF" macro-name "(" macro-value ")"
    macro-name  = 1*printable
    macro-value = 1*printable
    printable   = <any printable ASCII character except for white space>

Internet Draft                Mangle and Macro                July 2007


    Note:  There must not be any spaces within the mdef command (since
    spaces are used to separate parameters to POP commands).
    
    Once defined, the name of a macro can be used as a parameter to any
    POP command that takes parameters.  When used, the macro value
    replaces the macro name as the command parameter.
    
    Example:
    
    mdef mang(mangle(text=plain;headers=to:,subject:))
    
    The above example defines a macro with the name 'mang' whose value
    is "mangle(text=plain;headers=to:,subject:)".
    
    One situation in which macros are helpful is when clients using
    bandwidth-constrained links wish to use the MANGLE extension
    multiple times, with identical values in each usage.  For example,
    rather than a client entering the idential MANGLE extension as a
    parameter to every TOP or RETR command, the client first defines the
    extension as the value of a macro, then uses the macro name with the
    TOP or RETR commands.
    
    Example of use:
    
    C: mdef html(mangle(text=html;headers=foo))
    S: +OK Macro "html" accepted
    C: retr 1 html
    S: +OK Message follows
    S: Mime-version: 1.0
    S: Content-Type: text/html;charset="us-ascii"
    S: 
    S: <html><pre>This is a test.
    S: </pre></html>
    S: .
    
    
4.1.  MACRO Capability
    
    CAPA tag:
        MACRO
        
    Arguments:
        none
        
    Added commands:
        MDEF

    Standard commands affected:
        All commands valid in TRANSACTION state that take one or more
        parameters:  TOP, RETR, LIST, DELE, UIDL, extension commands
        
    Announced states / possible differences:
        both / no
        
    Commands valid in states:
        TRANSACTION
        
    Specification reference:
        This document
        
    Discussion:
        The MACRO capability indicates the MDEF command is available.
        See Section 4 for the details of the MDEF command.
        
        Note that the CAPA tag (MACRO) differs from the added command
        (MDEF), which violates the SHOULD in Section 5 of [POP-EXT].
        This is unfortunate, but because of an installed base of
        implementations existing since 2000, fixing it now would be
        worse than leaving it.
    
    
5.  IANA Considerations
    
    None.
    
    
6.  Security Considerations
    
    Alteration of message text destroys any security wrapper (digital
    signature) and is useless within encrypted content.  However, since
    the alteration is only for the text sent in direct response to the
    client, the original unaltered message remains in the message store.
    
    Servers need to be careful that macro expansion not exceed buffer
    sizes.
