Abstract

   This draft proposes to pack collections of static web objects
   belonging together such as HTML pages, graphics etc. into single
   archive files and to transport and treat them as a single compact
   object.

1.  General Issues

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

2.  Overview

   The web language HTML has become the universal standard for any
   kind of written information. One of it's most powerful properties
   are Hyperlinks, which allow to reference other objects for
   immediate access, and the ability to include graphics stored as
   separate data objects. Consequently, most documents written in HTML
   do consist of much more than just a single HTML text. They usually
   consist of a collection of related HTML pages and other objects
   such as graphical elements.

   Access to those documents usually causes separate access to every
   single one of these objects. Transferring them e.g. as an e-mail
   usually require to manually pack and archive them, and to unpack
   them before reading.

   This draft proposes to pack such a portion of webspace consisting
   of tightly related web objects into a single compressed archive
   file (like a zip archive), and to extend Web Browsers to treat
   these objects as a single file, e.g. when downloading or as
   attachments to e-mail.

   Such an archive file is called "spacelet".

   When displaying the contents of such a spacelet, the browser could
   treat it very much as if it were a web server or a directory tree
   on its own. URIs with the documents should be relative or relative
   to the root omitting the protocol and the server part, e.g.  <a
   HREF="/fruits/strawberry/index.html">.

3.  The descriptor

   The spacelet should contain a descriptor file with informations
   like

   -  Title/Subject
   -  Version and Date
   -  Author
   -  Validity and Expiry
   -  Languages
   -  Location where to look for newer versions

   It is still to be defined whether this file is to be an XML file or
   any other format.

4.  Security and Privacy

   Security mechanisms are yet to be defined in detail.  However, it
   is obvious that there are security requirements, most of all the
   authenticity and integrity of a spacelet.

   As a first approach, security should be compatible with those
   mechanisms already contained in common Web Browsers.

   The spacelet archive file could have a digital signature, and the
   descriptor file could tell details about the signer.  If the
   signature is made with a secret key certified by those certificate
   authorities which are already known to common web browsers
   (normally used to verify HTTPS connections).  Those keys might
   either be new signature keys made especially for spacelet signing,
   or simply the same key used for HTTPS web servers (if the
   certificate allows object signing). In the latter case, the host
   name of the webserver which's certificate was used it to be given
   as the signer in the descriptor file.

   Web browsers should treat and display spacelets with a digital
   signature similar to pages from HTTPS servers (i.e. show icons for
   digital signatures or ask whether to trust certificates from
   unknown authorities).

   Web browsers should also inform or ask the user before following a
   link pointing outside the spacelet. E.g. the web pages inside a
   spacelet should not be able to include graphics from outside the
   spacelet without explicit confirmation of the user to avoid
   compromising the user's privacy. Following Hyperlinks should not
   lead the user outside the spacelet without explicit approval.
