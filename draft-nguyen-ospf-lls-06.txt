Internet-Draft          OSPF Link-local Signaling           October 2006


Abstract

   OSPF is a link-state intra-domain routing protocol used in IP
   networks.  OSPF routers exchange information on a link using packets
   that follow a well-defined format.  The format of OSPF packets is not
   flexible enough to enable applications exchange arbitrary data, which
   may be necessary in certain situations.  This memo describes a vendor
   specific, backward-compatible technique to perform link-local
   signaling, i.e., exchange arbitrary data on a link.

Internet-Draft          OSPF Link-local Signaling           October 2006


1.  Introduction

   Formats of OSPF [RFC2328] packets are not very flexible to provide an
   acceptable mechanism for opaque data transfer.  However, this appears
   to be very useful to allow OSPF routers to do so.  An example where
   such a technique could be used is exchanging some capabilities on a
   link (standard OSPF utilizes Options field in Hello and Exchange
   packets, but there are not so many bits left in it).

   One potential way of solving this task could be introducing a new
   packet type.  However, that would mean introducing extra packets on
   the network which may not be desirable, so this document describes
   how to exchange data using existing, standard OSPF packet types.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Proposed Solution

   To perform link-local signaling (LLS), OSPF routers add a special
   data block at the end of OSPF packets or right after the
   authentication data block when cryptographic authentication is used.
   Like with OSPF cryptographic authentication, the length of the LLS-
   block is not included into the length of OSPF packet, but is included
   in the IP packet length.  Figure 1 illustrates how the LLS data block
   is attached.

                            +---------------------+ --
                            |                     | ^
                            | Authentication Data | | Y
                            |                     | v

                            |                     | v
                            +---------------------+ --


                    Figure 1: Attaching LLS Data Block

   The LLS data block may be attached to OSPF packets of two types---
   type 1 (OSPF Hello), and type-2 (OSPF DBD).  The data included in LLS
   block attached to a Hello packet may be used for dynamic signaling,
   since Hello packets may be sent at any moment in time.  However,
   delivery of LLS data in Hello packets is not guaranteed.  The data
   sent with DBD packets is guaranteed to be delivered as part of the
   adjacency forming process.

   This memo does not specify how the data transmitted by the LLS
   mechanism should be interpreted by OSPF routers.  The interface
   between OSPF LLS component and its clients is implementation-
   specific.

2.1.  Options Field

   A new bit, called L (L stands for LLS) is introduced to OSPF Options
   field (see Figure 2).  The value of the bit is 0x10.  Routers set L
   bit in Hello and DBD packets to indicate that the packet contains LLS
   data block.

      This bit is set only in Hello and DBD packets.  It is not set in
      OSPF LSAs and may be used in them for different purposes.

      contents of the LLS block.

   LLS Length
      The 16-bit LLS Data Length field contains the length (in 32-bit
      words) of the LLS block including the header and payload.
      Implementations should not use the Length field in the IP packet
      header to determine the length of the LLS data block.

   Note that if the OSPF packet is cryptographically authenticated, the
   LLS data block must also be cryptographically authenticated.  In this
   case the regular LLS checksum is not calculated and the LLS block
   will contain a cryptographic authentication TLV (see Section 2.4.2).

   The rest of the block contains a set of Type/Length/Value (TLV)
   triplets as described in Section 2.3.  All TLVs must be 32-bit
   aligned (with padding if necessary).

2.3.  LLS TLVs

   The contents of LLS data block is constructed using TLVs.  See Figure
   4 for the TLV format.

   The type field contains the TLV ID which is unique for each type of
   TLVs.  The Length field contains the length of the Value field (in
   bytes) that is variable and contains arbitrary data.

       .                                                               .
       .                             Value                             .

                       Figure 4: Format of LLS TLVs

   Note that TLVs are always padded to 32-bit boundary, but padding
   bytes are not included in TLV Length field (though it is included in
   the LLS Data Length field of the LLS block header).

2.4.  Predefined TLV

2.4.1.  Extended Options TLV

   This subsection describes a TLV called Extended Options (EO) TLV.
   The format of EO-TLV is shown in Figure 5.

Internet-Draft          OSPF Link-local Signaling           October 2006


   Bits in the Value field do not have any semantics from the point of
   view of LLS mechanism.  This field may be used to announce some OSPF
   capabilities that are link-specific.  Also, other OSPF extensions may
   allocate bits in the bit vector to perform boolean link-local
   signaling.

   The length of the Value field in EO-TLV is 4 bytes.

   The value of the type field in EO-TLV is 1.

   EO-TLV should only appear once in the LLS data block.

                        Figure 5: Format of EO TLV

   Currently, [OOB] and [RESTART] use bits in the Extended Options field
   of the EO-TLV.  The Extended Options bits are also defined in Section
   5.

2.4.2.  Cryptographic Authentication TLV

   This document defines a special TLV that is used for cryptographic
   authentication (CA-TLV) of the LLS data block.  This TLV should be
   included in the LLS block when the cryptographic (MD5) authentication
   is enabled on the corresponding interface.  The message digest of the
   LLS block should be calculated using the same key as that used for
   the main OSPF packet.  The cryptographic sequence number is included
   in the TLV and must be the same as the one in the main OSPF packet
   for the LLS block to be considered authentic.

   The TLV is constructed as shown Figure 6.

           Figure 6: Format of Cryptographic Authentication TLV

   The value of the Type field for CA-TLV is 2.

   The Length field in the header contains the length of the data
   portion of the TLV that includes 4 bytes for the Sequence Number and
   the length of the message digest (MD5) block for the whole LLS block
   in bytes (this will always be 16 bytes for MD5).  So AuthLen field
   will have value of 20.

   The Sequence Number field contains the cryptographic sequence number
   that is used to prevent simple replay attacks.  For the LLS block to
   be considered authentic, the Sequence Number in the CA-TLV must match
   the Sequence Number in the OSPF packet.

   The AuthData contains the message digest calculated for the LLS data
   block.

   The CA-TLV may appear in the LLS block only once.  Also, when
   present, this TLV should be the last in the LLS block.

3.  Backward Compatibility

   The modifications to OSPF packet formats are compatible with standard
   OSPF because LLS-incapable routers will not consider the extra data
   after the packet; i.e., the LLS data block will be ignored by routers
   which do not support the LLS extension.

4.  Security Considerations

   The function described in this document does not create any new
   security issues for the OSPF protocol.  The described technique
   provides the same level of security as OSPF protocol by allowing LLS
   data to be authenticated (see Section 2.4.2 for more details).

5.  IANA Considerations

   LLS TLV types are maintained by the IANA.  Extensions to OSPF which
   require a new LLS TLV type must be reviewed by an designated expert
   from the routing area.

   Following the policies outlined in [RFC2434], LLS type values in the
   range of 0-32767 are allocated through an IETF Consensus action and
   LLS type values in the range of 32768-65536 are reserved for private
   and experimental use.

   This document assigns LLS types 1 and 2, as follows:

        LLS Type    Name                                      Reference
            0       Reserved
