   The following definitions are from RFC 1738. Between the Internet
   Draft version and RFC 1738 two relevant changes were made: '=' was
   moved from the <extra> character class to <reserved>, and <national>
   was removed from the alternatives in <unreserved>. Neither <national>
   nor <punctuation> is referred to in this document nor in RFC 1738.
