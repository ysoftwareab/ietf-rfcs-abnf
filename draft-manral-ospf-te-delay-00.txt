            Traffic Engineering Extensions for link Latency
                     draft-manral-ospf-te-delay-00

Abstract

   RFC 3630 [RFC3630] describes extensions to OSPF protocol RFC 2328
   [RFC2328] to support intra-area Traffic Engineering (TE).  For
   multiple applications such as High Performance Computing and
   Electronic Financial markets, response times are critical.

   This document defines the Traffic Engineering (TE) extensions to RFC
   3630 [RFC3630] and and RFC 5329 [RFC5329] for defining a delay
   metric, which can be used by latency sensistive applications.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

1.  Introduction

   In High Frequency trading for Electronic Financial markets, computers
   make decisions based on the Electronic Data received, without human
   intervention.  These trades now account for a majority of the trading
   volumes and rely exclusively on ultra-low-latency direct market
   access.

   For MPLS networks that carry this traffic, latency is used as the
   ciriteria for defining Traffic Engineering tunnels.

   This draft defines extensions to RFC 3630 [RFC3630] and RFC 5329
   [RFC5329] to support a per link latency metric.  This metric combined
   with the hop-count define the delay/ latency on a Link State Path
   (LSP).

   This draft may be extended to carry the per-node switching latency of
   an MPLS router.


2.  Link Latency Sub-TLV

   The Link Latency Sub-TLV is valid only when carried in the Link TLV.
   The TLV MUST be sent in the Link TLV and MUST be ignored when
   received in any other TLV.

   Type A 16-bit field set to 22.

   Length A 16-bit field that indicates the length of the value. portion
   in octets.  For this sub-TLV, it MUST be 4 octets.

   Value Delay value of packet sent on the link in nano-seconds.


3.  IANA Considerations

   A new sub-TLV type is requested for the Link TLV for both RFC3630 and
   RFC5329.  The suggested value for the TLV is 22.
