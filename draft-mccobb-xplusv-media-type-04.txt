   XHTML+Voice 1.2 language specification is maintained by the VoiceXML
   Forum at <http://www.voicexml.org/specs/multimodal/x+v/12/>.

Internet-Draft  XHTML+Voice - application/xhtml-voice+xml  June 10, 2005


2. Introduction

   XHTML+Voice is a member of the XHTML family of document types, as
   specified by XHTML Modularization [XHTMLMOD].  XHTML+Voice extends
   XHTML 1.1 [XHTML11] with a modularized subset of VoiceXML 2.0
   [VXML20], XML Events [XMLEVNTS], and a few extensions to both XHTML
   and VoiceXML 2.0.  XHTML 1.1, VoiceXML 2.0 and XML Events are W3C
   Recommendations.

   The language integration defined by XHTML+Voice supports all modules
   defined by XHTML Modularization, and adds voice interaction to XHTML
   elements to enable multimodal applications.  The defined document
   type for XHTML+Voice is XHTML Host language document type conformant.

   XHTML+Voice 1.2 [XPLUSV12] is maintained by the VoiceXML Forum, at
   URI location <http://www.voicexml.org/specs/multimodal/x+v/12/>.

2.1 application/xhtml-voice+xml Usage

   The application/xhtml-voice+xml media type is intended to be a media
   descriptor for XHTML+Voice multimodal documents. Multimodal browsers
   have special processing requirements for XHTML+Voice documents, such
   as running a voice browser component, and support for the DOM Level
   2 Event Model [DOM2EV] and XML Events [XMLEVNTS].

   This media type registration is not intended for e-mail usage.

3. IANA Registration

      To: ietf-types@iana.org
      Subject: Registration of Standard MIME media type 
               application/xhtml-voice+xml

      MIME media type name: application

      MIME subtype name: xhtml-voice+xml

      Required parameters: none

      Optional parameters:

        charset:  has the same semantics as the charset parameter of the
                  "application/xml" media type specified in [RFC3023].

      Encoding considerations:  
                  XHTML+Voice has the same media type encoding
                  considerations specified in section 3.2 of [RFC3023].

      Security considerations:

   XHTML+Voice is an extension of XHTML and has the same security issues
   as XHTML.  These include interpreting anchors and forms in XHTML
   documents, and scripting languages and other dynamic interactive
   capabilities.  See section 7 of [RFC3236].

   In addition, the scripting language can be accessed by both the XHTML
   and the VoiceXML 2.0 markup embedded in the XHTML+Voice document.
   See section 1.3.1.5 of [XPLUSV12].

   XML-Events [XMLEVNTS] allows an author to attach a handler to any
   node in the document.  The handler that is activated in response to a
   specified event may be either a voice dialog or a script that can be
   either in the same or an external document.

      Interoperability considerations :

   Because XHTML+Voice is built upon W3C standard recommendations, it is
   designed to be interoperable across a wide range of platforms and
   client devices.  Because the extensions to XHTML are identified by
   their namespaces, all browsers that have namespace support can run an
   XHTML+Voice document as an XHTML document without voice interaction.
      
     Published specification:

         The latest published version of XHTML+Voice is [XPLUSV12].

      Applications which use this media type:

         XHTML+Voice documents are intended to be deployed on the World
         Wide Web and rendered by multimodal browsers that support the
         visual and voice modes of interaction.  Because XHTML+Voice is
         an application of XML, authors can expect XHTML+Voice user
         agents to be conformant XML 1.0 [XML] processors.  See section
         2 of [RFC3236].

      Additional information:

         Magic number(s):  There is no single string that is always
             present.
         File extension(s): mxml, xhvml, xvml, xvm
         Macintosh File Type Code(s): TEXT

      Further information:

4. Fragment Identifiers

   See section 3 of [RFC3236].  Following [RFC3236], fragment
   identifiers for XHTML+Voice documents designate the element with the
   corresponding ID attribute value (see [XML] section 3.3.1).

   While XHTML+Voice adds new ID attributes with fragment identifier
   namespaces that are not in the same namespace as XHTML, uniqueness
   of the ID attribute values is preserved within the document.  See
   sections 1.3.1 and 5.3 of [XPLUSV12].

5. Recognizing XHTML+Voice files

   Because XHTML+Voice is XML, an XHTML+Voice document [optionally]
   starts with an XML declaration which begins with "<?xml" and has a
   DOCTYPE declaration "<!DOCTYPE html".  XHTML+Voice 1.2 has the
   following DOCTYPE declaration:
 
   <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//VoiceXML Forum//DTD XHTML+Voice 1.2//EN"
"http://www.voicexml.org/specs/multimodal/x+v/12/dtd/xhtml+voice12.dtd">
   
   Because XHTML+Voice is in the XHTML family of languages, the root
   element of an XHTML+Voice document is 'html' and '<html' can be found
   near the top of the document.  

6. Security Considerations

   Security considerations for this media type are discussed in the MIME
   type registration that appears in section 3.

7. IANA Considerations

   As described in Section 3, this document specifies the registration
   of a MIME type for XHTML+Voice documents according to [RFC3023].
