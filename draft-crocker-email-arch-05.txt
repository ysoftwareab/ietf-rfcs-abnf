Abstract

   Over its thirty-five year history Internet Mail has undergone
   significant changes in scale and complexity, as it has become a
   global infrastructure service.  The first standardized architecture
   for networked email specified a simple split between the user world,
   in the form of Mail User Agents (MUA), and the transmission world, in
   the form of the Mail Handling Service (MHS) composed of Mail Transfer
   Agents (MTA).  Core aspects of the service, such as mailbox address
   and basic message format style, have remained remarkably constant.

   However today Internet Mail is marked by many independent operators,
   many different components for providing users service and many others
   for performing message transfer.  Public discussion of the
   architecture has not kept pace with the real-world technical and
   operational refinements.  This document offers an enhanced Internet
   Mail architecture to reflect the current service.

Internet-Draft             EMail Architecture               October 2006


1.  Introduction

   Over its thirty-five year history Internet Mail has undergone
   significant changes in scale and complexity, as it has become a
   global infrastructure service.  However the changes have been
   evolutionary, rather than revolutionary, reflecting a strong desire
   to preserve its installed base of users and utility.

   The first standardized architecture for networked email specified a
   simple split between the user world, in the form of Mail User Agents
   (MUA), and the transmission world, in the form of the Mail Handling
   Service (MHS) composed of Mail Transfer Agents (MTA).  The MHS is
   responsible for accepting a message from one User and delivering it
   to one or more others, creating a virtual MUA-to-MUA exchange
   environment.

                Figure 1: Basic Internet Mail Service Model

   Today Internet Mail is marked by many independent operators, many
   different components for providing users service and many other
   components for performing message transfer.  So it is not surprising
   that the operational service has sub-divided each of these "layers"
   into more specialized modules.  Core aspects of the service, such as

   mailbox address and message style, have remained remarkably constant.
   However public discussion of the architecture has not kept pace with
   the real-world refinements.  This document offers an enhanced
   Internet Mail architecture to reflect the current service.  The
   original distinction between user-level concerns and transfer-level
   concerns is retained, with an elaboration to each "level" of the
   architecture that is discussed separately.  The term "Internet Mail"
   is used to refer to the entire collection of user and transfer
   components.

   For Internet Mail the term "end-to-end" usually refers to a single
   posting and the set of deliveries directly resulting from its single
   transiting of the MHS.  A common exception is with group dialogue
   that is mediated via a mailing list, so that two postings occur,
   before intended recipients receive an originator's message.  In fact,
   some uses of email consider the entire email service -- including
   Originator and Recipient -- as a subordinate component.  For these
   services "end-to-end" refers to points outside of the email service.
   Examples are voicemail over email [RFC2423], EDI over email [RFC1767]
   and facsimile over email.[ID-ffpim]

   The current draft seeks to:

   o  Document refinements to the email model

   o  Clarify functional roles for the architectural components

   o  Clarify identity-related issues, across the email service

   o  Provide a document that serves as a common venue for further
      defining and citing modern Internet Mail architecture

   NOTE:

      Any attempt to provide a retroactive description, for a service
      that has evolved so extensively, is certain to claim definitions
      and relationships that do not match the equally reasonable views
      of some portion of the technical community.  Ultimately the
      "correct" choices are determined solely by the willingness of that
      community to use the descriptions.

1.1.  Service Overview

   End-to-end Internet Mail exchange is accomplished by using a
   standardized infrastructure comprising:






Crocker                  Expires April 25, 2007                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft             EMail Architecture               October 2006


   o  An email object

   o  Global addressing

   o  An asynchronous sequence of point-to-point transfer mechanisms

   o  No prior arrangement between Originator and Recipient

   o  No prior arrangement between point-to-point transfer services,
      over the open Internet

   o  No requirement for Originator and Recipient to be online at the
      same time.

   The end-to-end portion of the service is the email object, called a
   message.  Broadly the message, itself, is divided between handling
   control information and user message content.

   A precept to the design of mail over the open Internet is permitting
   user-to-user and MTA-to-MTA interoperability to take place with no
   prior direct administrative arrangement between independent
   Administrative Management Domains.  That is, all participants rely on
   having the core services be universally supported, either directly or
   through Gateways that translate between Internet Mail standards and
   other email environments.

   Within localized environments (Edge networks) prior administrative
   arrangement can include access control, routing constraints and
   lookup service configuration.  In recent years one change to local
   environments is an increased requirement for authentication or, at
   least, accountability.  In these cases a server performs explicit
   validation of the client's identity.

1.2.  Field Referencing Convention

   In this document, references to structured fields of a message use a
   two-part dotted notation.  The first part cites the document that
   contains the specification for the field and the second is the name
   of the field.  Hence <RFC2822.From> is the From field in an email
   content header and <RFC2821.MailFrom> is the address in the SMTP
   "Mail From" command.

1.3.  Document terminology and conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as specified in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.4.  Discussion venue

   Please direct discussion about this document to the IETF-SMTP mailing
   list <http://www.imc.org/ietf-smtp>.

1.5.  Changes

   o  Small modifications to figures

   o  Settled on term "ADministrative Management Domain (ADMD) to refer
      to independent operational environments.  A bit of an homage to
      X.400...

   o  Various clarifications and wordsmithing.


2.  Email Actor Roles

   Internet Mail is a highly distributed service, with a variety of
   actors serving different roles.  These divide into 3 basic types:

   o  User

   o  Mail Handling Service (MHS)

   o  ADministrative Management Domain (ADMD)

   Although related to a technical architecture, the focus on Actors
   concerns participant responsibilities, rather than on functional
   modules.  Hence the labels used are different than for classic email
   architecture diagrams.  Actors often will be associated with
   different organizations.  This operational independence provides the
   motivation for distinguishing among different ADMDs.

2.1.  User Actors

   Users are the sources and sinks of messages.  They can be humans or
   processes.  They can have an exchange that iterates and they can
   expand or contract the set of Users participating in a set of
   exchanges.  In Internet Mail there are three types of user-level
   Actors:

   o  Originators

   o  Recipients

   o  Mediators

Internet-Draft             EMail Architecture               October 2006


   From the User-level perspective all mail transfer activities are
   performed by a monolithic Mail Handling Service (MHS), even though
   the actual service can be provided by many independent organizations.
   Users are customers of this unified service.

   The following depicts the flow of messages among Actors.

                 Figure 2: Relationships Among User Actors

2.1.1.  Originator

   Also called "Author", this is the user-level participant responsible
   for creating original content and requesting its transmission.  The
   MHS operates to send and deliver mail among Originators and
   Recipients.  As described below, the MHS has a "Source" role that
   correlates with the Author role.

2.1.2.  Recipient

   The Recipient is a consumer of delivered content.  As described
   below, the MHS has a "Dest[ination]" role that correlates with the
   Recipient role.



Crocker                  Expires April 25, 2007                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft             EMail Architecture               October 2006


   A Recipient can close the user-level communication loop by creating
   and submitting a new message that replies to an Originator.  An
   example of an automated form of reply is the Message Disposition
   Notification, which informs the Originator about how the Recipient
   handled the message.  See Section 4.1.

2.1.3.  Mediator

   A Mediator receives, aggregates, reformulates and redistributes
   messages as part of a potentially-protracted, higher-level exchange
   among Users.  Example uses of Mediators include group dialogue and
   organizational message flow, as occurs with a purchase approval
   process.  Note that it is easy to confuse this user-level activity
   with the underlying MHS transfer exchanges.  However they serve very
   different purposes and operate in very different ways.  Mediators are
   considered extensively in Section 5.

   When mail is delivered to the mailbox address specified in the
   RFC2821.MailFrom command, a receiving Mediator is viewed by the Mail
   Handling Service as a Recipient.  When submitting messages, the
   Mediator is an Originator.  What is distinctive is that a Mediator
   preserves the Originator information of the message it reformulates,
   but may make meaningful changes to the content.  Hence the MHS sees a
   new message, but Users receive a message that is interpreted as
   primarily being from -- or, at least, initiated by -- the author of
   the original message.  The role of a Mediator permits distinct,
   active creativity, rather than being limited to the more constrained
   job of merely connecting together other participants.  Hence it is
   really the Mediator that is responsible for the new message.

   A Mediator's task can be complex and contingent, such as by modifying
   and adding content or regulating which users are allowed to
   participate and when.  The popular example of this role is a group
   mailing list.  A sequence of Mediators may even perform a series of
   formal steps, such as reviewing, modifying and approving a purchase
   request.

   Because a Mediator originates messages, it might also receive
   replies.  So a Mediator really is a full-fledged User.

   Gateway:   A Gateway is a particularly interesting form of Mediator.
      It is a hybrid of User and Relay that interconnects heterogeneous
      mail services.  Its goal is to emulate a Relay, so Gateway is
      described in more detail, in Section 2.2.4.

2.2.  MHS Actors

   The Mail Handling Service (MHS) has the task of performing a single,
   email-level, end-to-end transfer on behalf of the Originator and
   reaching the Recipient address(es) specified in the envelope.
   Mediated or protracted, iterative exchanges, such as those used for
   collaboration over time, are part of the User-level service, and are
   not part of this Transfer-level Handling Service.

   The following depicts the relationships among transfer participants
   in Internet Mail.  It shows the Source as distinct from the
   Originator, and Dest[ination] as distinct from Recipient, although it
   is common for each pair to be the same actor.  The figure also shows
   multiple Relays in the sequence.  It is legal to have no separate
   Relay, where the Source and Dest interact directly.  For intra-
   organization mail services, it is common to have only one Relay.

   +------------+                         +-----------+

2.2.1.  Source

   The Source role is responsible for ensuring that a message is valid
   for posting and then submitting it to a Relay.  Validity includes
   conformance with Internet Mail standards, as well as with local
   operational policies.  The Source can simply review the message for
   conformance and reject it if there are errors, or it can create some
   or all of the necessary information.

   The Source operates with dual "allegiance".  It serves the Originator
   and often it is the same entity.  However its role in assuring
   validity means that it MUST also represent the local operator of the
   MHS, that is, the local ADministrative Management Domain (ADMD).

   The Source also has the responsibility for any post-submission,
   Originator-related administrative tasks associated with message
   transmission and delivery.  Notably this pertains to error and
   delivery notices.  Hence Source is best held accountable for the
   message content, even when they did not create any or most of it.

2.2.2.  Bounce Handler

   The Bounce Handler processes service notifications that are generated
   by the MHS, as a result of its efforts to transfer or deliver the
   message.  Notices can be about failures or completions and are sent
   to an address that is specified by the Source.  This Bounce handling
   address (also known as a Return address) might have no visible
   characteristics in common with the address of the Originator or
   Source.

   NOTE:

      The choice of the label "Bounce" is unfortunate, due to its
      negative implication.  Currently, this is the most popular term
      for the field.

2.2.3.  Relay

   A mail Relay performs email transfer-service routing and store-and-
   forward.  It adds envelope-level handling information and then
   (re-)transmits the message on towards its Recipient(s).  A Relay can
   add information to the envelope, such as with trace information.
   However it does not modify existing envelope information or the
   message content semantics.  It can modify message content syntax,
   such as a change from text to binary transfer-encoding form, only as
   required to meet the capabilities of the next hop in the MHS.

   A set of Relays composes a Mail Handling Service (MHS) network.  This

   is above any underlying packet-switching network that they might be
   using and below any gateways or other user-level Mediators.

   In other words, interesting email scenarios can involve three
   distinct architectural layers of store-and-forward service:

   o  User Mediators

   o  MHS Relays

   o  Packet Switches

   with the bottom-most usually being the Internet's IP service.  The
   most basic email scenarios involve Relays and Switches.

   Aborting a message transfer results in having the Relay become an
   Originator and send an error message to the Bounce address.  (The
   potential for looping is avoided by having this message, itself,
   contain no Bounce address.)

2.2.4.  Gateway

   A Gateway is a hybrid form of User and Relay that interconnects
   heterogeneous mail services.  Its purpose is simply to emulate a
   Relay and the closer it comes to this, the better.  However it
   operates at the User level, because it MUST be able to modify message
   content.

   Differences between mail services can be as small as minor syntax
   variations, but usually encompass significant, semantic distinctions.
   One difference could have the concept of an email address be a
   hierarchical, machine-specific address versus have it be a flat,
   global name space.  Another difference could be between text-only
   content, versus multi-media.  Hence the Relay function in a Gateway
   offers significant design challenges, to make the result be as
   seamless as possible.  The more significant challenge is in ensuring
   the user-to-user functionality that matches syntax and semantics of
   independent email standards suites.

   The basic test of a Gateway's adequacy is, of course, whether an
   Originator on one side of a Gateway can send a message to a Recipient
   on the other side, without requiring changes to any of the components
   in the Originator's or Recipient's mail services, other than adding
   the Gateway.  To each of these otherwise independent services, the
   Gateway will appear to be a "native" participant.  However the
   ultimate test of a Gateway's adequacy is whether the Originator and
   Recipient can sustain a dialogue.  In particular can a Recipient's
   MUA automatically formulate a valid Reply that will reach the initial

   Originator?

2.3.  Administrative Actors

   Operation of Internet Mail services is apportioned to different
   providers (or operators).  Each can be composed of an independent
   ADministrative Management Domain (ADMD).  Examples include an end-
   user operating their desktop client, a department operating a local
   Relay, an IT department operating an enterprise Relay and an ISP
   operating a public shared email service.  These can be configured
   into many combinations of administrative and operational
   relationships, with each ADMD potentially having a complex
   arrangement of functional components.  Figure 4 depicts the
   relationships among ADMDs.  Perhaps the most salient aspect of an
   ADMD is the differential trust that determines its policies for
   activities within the ADMD, versus those involving interactions with
   other ADMDs.  The architectural impact of needing to have boundaries
   between ADMD's is discussed in [Tussle]

   Basic types of ADMDs include:

   Edge:   Independent transfer services, in networks at the edge of the
      open Internet Mail service.

   User:   End-user services.  This might be subsumed under the Edge
      service, such as is common for web-based email access.

   Transit:   These are Mail Service Providers (MSP) offering value-
      added capabilities for Edge ADMDs, such as aggregation and
      filtering.

Internet-Draft             EMail Architecture               October 2006


   Note that Transit services are quite different from packet-level
   transit operation.  Whereas end-to-end packet transfers usually go
   through intermediate routers, email exchange across the open Internet
   is often directly between the Boundary MTAs of Edge ADMDs, at the
   email level.

   Edge networks can use proprietary email standards internally.
   However the distinction between Transit network and Edge network
   transfer services is primarily significant because it highlights the
   need for concern over interaction and protection between independent
   administrations.  In particular this distinction calls for additional
   care in assessing transitions of responsibility, as well as the
   accountability and authorization relationships among participants in
   email transfer.

   The interactions between functional components within an ADMD are
   subject to the policies of that domain.  Policies can cover such
   things as reliability, access control, accountability and even
   content evaluation and modification.  They can be implemented in
   different functional components, according to the needs of the ADMD.
   For example see [ID-spamops].

   User, Edge and Transit services can be offered by providers that
   operate component services or sets of services.  Further it is
   possible for one ADMD to host services for other ADMDs.  Common ADMD
   examples are:

   Enterprise Service Providers:

      Operating an organization's internal data and/or mail services.

   Internet Service Providers:

      Operating underlying data communication services that, in turn,
      are used by one or more Relays and Users.  It is not necessarily
      their job to perform email functions, but they can, instead,
      provide an environment in which those functions can be performed.

   Mail Service Providers:

      Operating email services, such as for end-users, or mailing lists.

   Operational pragmatics often dictate that providers be involved in
   detailed administration and enforcement issues, to help ensure the
   health of the overall Internet Mail Service.  This can include
   operators of lower-level packet services.


3.  Identities

   Internet Mail uses three forms of identity.  The most common is the
   end-point mailbox address <addr-spec> [RFC2822] Also see the related
   usage for <address> and <mailbox> in [RFC2821].  The other two forms
   of email identity are the domain name <domain> Section 3.2 and
   message identifier <msg-id> [RFC2822].

3.1.  Mailbox

      "A mailbox sends and receives mail.  It is a conceptual entity
      which does not necessarily pertain to file storage."  [RFC2822]

   A mailbox is specified as an Internet Mail address <addr-spec>.  It
   has two distinct parts, divided by an at-sign ("@").  The right-hand
   side is a globally interpreted domain name that is part of an Common
   Operating Group.  Domain Names are discussed in Section 3.2.  Formal
   Internet Mail addressing syntax can support source routes, to
   indicate the path through which a message should be sent.  Although
   legal, the use of source routes is not part of the modern Internet
   Mail service and it is ignored in the rest of this document.

   The portion to the left of the at-sign contains a string that is
   globally opaque and is called the <local-part>.  It is to be
   interpreted only by the entity specified in the address's right-hand
   side.  All other entities MUST treat the local-part as a
   uninterpreted literal string and MUST preserve all of its original

   details.  As such its public distribution is equivalent to sending a
   "cookie" that is only interpreted upon being returned to its
   originator.

3.1.1.  Global Standards for Local-Part

   It is common for sites to have local structuring conventions for the
   left-hand side (local-part) of an addr-spec.  This permits sub-
   addressing, such as for distinguishing different discussion groups by
   the same participant.  However it is worth stressing that these
   conventions are strictly private to the user's organization and MUST
   not be interpreted by any domain except the one listed in the right-
   hand side of the addr-spec, and those specialized services conforming
   to standardized conventions, as noted in the next paragraph.

   A small class of addresses has an elaboration on basic email
   addressing, with a standardized, global schema for the local-part.
   These are conventions between originating end-systems and Recipient
   Gateways, and they are invisible to the public email transfer
   infrastructure.  When an Originator is explicitly sending via a
   Gateway out of the Internet, there are coding conventions for the
   local-part, so that the Originator can formulate instructions for the
   Gateway.  Standardized examples of this are the telephone numbering
   formats for VPIM [RFC2421], such as "+16137637582@vpim.example.com",
   and iFax [RFC2304], such as
   "FAX=+12027653000/T33S=1387@ifax.example.com".

3.1.2.  Scope of Email Address Use

   Email addresses are being used far beyond their original email
   transfer and delivery role.  In practical terms, email strings have
   become a common form of user identity on the Internet.  What is
   essential, then, is to be clear about the nature and role of an
   identity string in a particular context and to be clear about the
   entity responsible for setting that string.

3.2.  Domain Names

   A domain name is a global reference to an Internet resource, such as
   a host, a service or a network.  A name usually maps to one or more
   IP Addresses.  Conceptually the name might encompass an entire
   organization, or a collection of machines integrated into a
   homogeneous service, or only a single machine.  A domain name can be
   administered to refer to individual users, but this is not common
   practice.  The name is structured as a hierarchical sequence of sub-
   names, separated by dots (".").  Domain names are defined and
   operated through the Domain Name Service (DNS) [RFC1034], [RFC1035],
   [RFC2181].



Crocker                  Expires April 25, 2007                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft             EMail Architecture               October 2006


   When not part of a mailbox address, a domain name is used in Internet
   Mail to refer to the ADMD or the host that took action upon the
   message, such as providing the administrative scope for a message
   identifier, or performing transfer processing.

3.3.  Message Identifier

   There are two standardized tags, for identifying messages.

   Message-ID:

      The Message-ID is a user-level tag, primarily used for threading
      and elimination of duplicates and is specified in [RFC2822].  It
      is associated with the RFC2822.From, although any actor within the
      originating ADMD might assign it.  The recipient's ADMD is the
      intended consumer of the Message-ID, although any actor along the
      transmission path might use it.  Internet Mail standards provide
      for a single Message-ID; however more than one is sometimes
      assigned.

      Like a mailbox address, a Message-ID has two distinct parts,
      divided by an at-sign ("@").  The right-hand side is globally
      interpreted and specifies the ADMD or host assigning the
      identifier.  The left-hand side contains a string that is globally
      opaque and serves to uniquely identify the message within the
      domain referenced on the right-hand side.  The duration of
      uniqueness for the message identifier is undefined.

      When a message is revised in any way, the question of whether to
      assign a new Message-ID requires a subjective assessment, deciding
      whether the editorial content has been changed enough to
      constitute a new message.  [RFC2822] says "a message identifier
      pertains to exactly one instantiation of a particular message;
      subsequent revisions to the message each receive new message
      identifiers."  However real-world experience dictates some
      flexibility.  An impossible test is whether the recipient will
      consider the new message to be equivalent to the old.  For most
      components of Internet Mail, there is no way to predict a specific
      recipient's preferences on this matter.  Both creating and failing
      to create a new Message-ID have their downsides.

      The best that can be offered, here, are some guidelines and
      examples:



      *  If a message is changed only in terms of form, such as
         character-encoding, it clearly is still the same message.



Crocker                  Expires April 25, 2007                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft             EMail Architecture               October 2006


      *  If a message has minor additions to the content, such as a
         mailing list tag at the beginning of the RFC2822.Subject header
         field, or some mailing list administrative information added to
         the end of the primary body-part's text, then it probably is
         still the same message.

      *  If a message has viruses deleted from it, it probably is still
         the same message.

      *  If a message has offensive words deleted from it, then some
         recipients will consider it the same message, but some will
         not.

      *  If a message is translated into a different language, then some
         recipients will consider it the same message, but some will
         not.

      The absence of objective, precise criteria for Message-ID re-
      generation, along with the absence of strong protection associated
      with the string, means that the presence of an ID can permit an
      assessment that is marginally better than a heuristic, but the ID
      certainly has no value for strict formal reference or comparison.
      Hence it is not appropriate to use the Message-ID for any process
      that might be called "security".

   ENVID:

      The ENVID (envelope identifier) is an envelope-level tag,
      primarily for use within Delivery Status Notifications, so that
      the Bounce Address (RFC2821.MailFrom) recipient can correlate the
      DSN with a particular message.  The ENVID is therefore used from
      one message posting, until the directly-resulting message
      deliveries.  It does not survive re-postings [RFC3461].

      The format of an ENVID is free-form.  Although its creator might
      choose to impose structure on the string, none is imposed by
      Internet standards.  By implication, the scope of the string is
      defined by the domain name of the Bounce Address.


4.  Services and Standards

   The Internet's MHS architecture distinguishes among six different
   types of functional components, arranged to support a store-and-
   forward service architecture:

Internet-Draft             EMail Architecture               October 2006


   o  Message

   o  Mail User Agent (MUA)

   o  Message Submission Agent (MSA)

   o  Message Transfer Agent (MTA)

   o  Message Delivery Agent (MDA)

   o  Message Store (MS)

   This section describes each functional component for Internet Mail,
   and the standard protocols associated with their operation.

   Software implementations of these architectural components often
   compress them, such as having the same software do MSA, MTA and MDA
   functions.  However the requirements for each of these components of
   the service are becoming more extensive.  So their separation is
   increasingly common.

   NOTE:

      A discussion about any interesting system architecture is often
      complicated by confusion between architecture versus
      implementation.  An architecture defines the conceptual functions
      of a service, divided into discrete conceptual modules.  An
      implementation of that architecture can combine or separate
      architectural components, as needed for a particular operational
      environment.  It is important not to confuse the engineering
      decisions that are made to implement a product, with the
      architectural abstractions used to define conceptual functions.

   This figure shows function modules and the protocols used between
   them.  Additional protocols and configurations are possible.

4.1.  Message Data

   The purpose of the Mail Handling Service is to exchange a message
   object among participants [RFC2822] [RFC0822].  Hence all of the
   underlying mechanisms are merely in the service of getting that
   message from its Originator to its Recipients.  A message can be
   explicitly labeled as to its nature [RFC3458].

   A message comprises a transit handling envelope and the end-user
   message content.  The envelope contains handling information used by
   the Message Handling Service, or generated by it.  The content is
   divided into a structured header and the body.  The body may be
   unstructured simple lines of text, or it may be a tree of multi-media
   subordinate objects, called body-parts.

   Internet Mail has some special control data:

   Delivery Status Notification (DSN):

      A Delivery Status Notification (DSN) is a message that can be
      generated by the Mail Handling Service (MSA, MTA or MDA) and sent
      to the RFC2821.MailFrom address.  The mailbox for this is shown as
      Bounces in Figure 5 It provides information about message transit,
      such as transmission errors or successful delivery.  [RFC3461]

   Message Disposition Notification (MDN):

      A Message Disposition Notification (MDN) is a message that can be
      generated by an rMUA and is sent to the
      Disposition-Notification-To address(es).  The mailbox for this is
      shown as Disp in Figure 5.  It provides information about user-
      level, Recipient-side message processing, such as indicating that
      the message has been displayed [RFC3798] or the form of content
      that can be supported.  [RFC3297]

   Message Filtering (SIEVE):

      SIEVE is a scripting language that permits specifying conditions
      for differential handling of mail, at the time of delivery
      [RFC3028].  It can be conveyed in a variety of ways, as a MIME
      part.  Figure 5 shows a Sieve specification going from the rMUA to
      the MDA.  However filtering can be done at many different points
      along the transit path and any one or more of them might be
      subject to Sieve directives, especially within a single ADMD.
      Hence the Figure shows only one relationship, for simplicity.

4.1.1.  Envelope

   Information that is directly used by, or produced by, the MHS is
   called the "envelope".  It controls and records handling activities
   by the transfer service.  Internet Mail has a fragmented framework
   for handling this "handling" information.  The envelope exists partly
   in the transfer protocol SMTP [RFC2821] and partly in the message
   object [RFC2822].  The SMTP specification uses the term to refer only
   to the transfer-protocol information.

   NOTE:

      Due to the frequent use of the term "envelope" to refer only to
      SMTP constructs, there has been some call for using a different
      term, to label the larger set of information defined here.  So
      far, no alternative term has developed any community support.

   Direct envelope addressing information, as well as optional transfer
   directives, are carried within the SMTP control channel.  Other
   envelope information, such as trace records, is carried within the
   message object header fields.  Upon delivery, some SMTP-level
   envelope information is typically encoded within additional message
   object header fields, such as Return-Path.

4.1.2.  Header Fields

   Header fields are attribute name/value pairs covering an extensible
   range of email service, user content and user transaction meta-
   information.  The core set of header fields is defined in [RFC2822],
   [RFC0822].  It is common to extend this set, for different
   applications.  Procedures for registering header fields are defined
   in [RFC4021].  An extensive set of existing header field
   registrations is provided in [RFC3864].

   One danger with placing additional information in header fields is
   that Gateways often alter or delete them.

4.1.3.  Body

   The body of a message might simply be lines of ASCII text or it might
   be hierarchically structured into a composition of multi-media body-
   part attachments, using MIME [RFC2045], [RFC2046], [RFC2047],
   [RFC2048], and [RFC2049].  MIME structures each body-part into a
   recursive set of MIME header field meta-data and MIME Content
   sections.

4.1.4.  Identity References in a Message

   For a message in transit, the core uses of identity references
   combine into:

       +-----------------------+-------------+---------------------+
       | Layer                 | Field       | Set By              |

       +-----------------------+-------------+---------------------+

                            Layered Identities

4.2.  User-Level Services

   Interactions at the user level entail protocol exchanges, distinct
   from those that occur at lower layers of the architecture.  Because
   the motivation for email, and much of its use, is for interaction
   among humans, the nature and details of these protocol exchanges
   often are determined by the needs of human and group communication.
   In terms of efforts to specify behaviors, one effect of this is to
   require subjective guidelines, rather than strict rules, for some
   aspects of system behavior.  Mailing Lists provide particularly
   salient examples of this.

4.2.1.  Mail User Agent (MUA)

   A Mail User Agent (MUA) works on behalf of end-users and end-user
   applications.  It is their "representative" within the email service.

   The Origination-side (oMUA) creates a message and performs initial
   "submission" into the transfer infrastructure, via a Mail Submission
   Agent (MSA).  It can also perform any creation- and posting-time
   archival.  An MUA outbox is part of the origination-side MUA.

   The Recipient-side rMUA works on behalf of the end-user Recipient to



Crocker                  Expires April 25, 2007                [Page 22]

Internet-Draft             EMail Architecture               October 2006


   process received mail.  This includes generating user-level return
   control messages, display and disposition of the received message,
   and closing or expanding the user communication loop, by initiating
   replies and forwarding new messages.

   An MUA can, itself, have a distributed implementation, such as a
   "thin" user interface module on a limited end-user device, with the
   bulk of the MUA functionality operated remotely on a more capable
   server.  An example of such an architecture might use IMAP [RFC3501]
   for most of the interactions between an MUA client and an MUA server.

   A Mediator is special class of MUA.  It performs message re-posting,
   as discussed in Section 2.1.

   Identity fields relevant to the MUA include:

   RFC2822.From

      Set by: Originator

      Names and addresses for author(s) of the message content are
      listed in the From field

   RFC2822.Reply-To

      Set by: Originator

      If a message Recipient sends a reply message that would otherwise
      use the RFC2822.From field address(es) contained in the original
      message, then they are instead to use the address(es) in the
      RFC2822.Reply-To field.  In other words this field is a direct
      override of the From field, for responses from Recipients.

   RFC2822.Sender

      Set by: Source

      This specifies the address responsible for submitting the message
      into the transfer service.  For efficiency this field can be
      omitted if it contains the same address as RFC2822.From.  However
      this does not mean there is no Sender specified.  Rather it means
      that that header field is virtual and that the address in the From
      field MUST be used.  Specification of the error return addresses
      -- the "Bounce" address, contained in RFC2821.MailFrom -- is made
      by the RFC2822.Sender.  Typically the Bounce address is the same
      as the Sender address.  However some usage scenarios require it to
      be different.

Internet-Draft             EMail Architecture               October 2006


   RFC2822.To, RFC2822.CC

      Set by: Originator

      These specify MUA Recipient addresses.  The addresses in the
      fields might not be present in the RFC2821.RcptTo command.  The
      distinction between To and CC is subjective.  Generally a To
      addressee is considered primary and is expected to take action on
      the message.  A CC addressee typically receives a copy only for
      their information.

   RFC2822.BCC

      Set by: Originator

      A message might be copied to an addressee whose participation is
      not to be disclosed to the RFC2822.To or RFC2822.CC Recipients
      and, usually, not to the other BCC Recipients.  The BCC header
      field indicates a message copy to such a Recipient.  Typically,
      the field lists no addresses or only lists the address of the
      Recipient receiving this copy.  An MUA will typically make
      separate postings for TO and CC Recipients, versus BCC Recipients.
      The former will see no indication that any BCCs were sent, whereas
      the latter have a BCC field present.  It might be empty, contain a
      comment, or contain one or more BCC addresses, depending upon the
      preferences of the Originator.

4.2.2.  Message Store (MS)

   An MUA can employ a long-term Message Store (MS).  A rich set of
   choices for the use of that store derives from permitting more than
   one to be associated with a single user, demonstrated as a Server-
   based (sMS) User-based MS (uMS) in Figure 5.  The sMS is shown as
   being remote from the MUA and the uMS as being local.  Further the
   relationship between two message stores can vary.  Between the MDA
   and the MUA, these choices are supported by a wide variety of
   protocol options.

   The operational relationship among MSs can be:

   Online:

      Only a remote MS is used, with messages being accessible only when
      the MUA is attached to the MS, and the MUA repeatedly fetches all
      or part of a message, from one session to the next.

Internet-Draft             EMail Architecture               October 2006


   Offline:

      The MS is local to the user, and messages are completely moved
      from any remote store, rather than (also) being retained there.

   Disconnected:

      An r MS and a uMS are kept synchronized, for all or part of their
      contents, while there is a connection between them.  While they
      are disconnected, mail can continue to arrive at the rMS and the
      user may continue to make changes to the uMS.  Upon reconnections,
      the two stores are re-synchronized.

4.3.  MHS-Level Services

4.3.1.  Mail Submission Agent (MSA)

   A Mail Submission Agent (MSA) accepts the message submission from the
   oMUA and enforces the policies of the hosting ADMD and the
   requirements of Internet standards.  Enforcement might be passive,
   involving review and approval or rejection, or it might be active,
   involving direct modification of the message.  An MSA implements a
   server function to MUAs and a client function to MTAs (or MDAs).

   Examples of MSA-styled functions, in the world of paper mail, might
   range across the very different capabilities of administrative
   assistants, postal drop boxes, and post office front-counter
   employees.

   The MUA/MSA interface can be implemented within a single host and use
   private conventions for its interactions.  Historically, standards-
   based MUA/MSA interactions have used SMTP [RFC2821].  However a
   recent alternative is SUBMISSION [RFC2476].  Although SUBMISSION
   derives from SMTP, it on a separate TCP port and imposes distinct
   requirements, such as access authorization.

   Identities relevant to the MSA include:

   RFC2821.HELO/.EHLO

      Set by: Source

      The MSA can specify its hosting domain identity for the SMTP HELO
      or EHLO command operation.

Internet-Draft             EMail Architecture               October 2006


   RFC2821.MailFrom

      Set by: Source

      This is an end-to-end string that specifies an email address for
      receiving return control information, such as "bounces".  The name
      of this field is misleading, because it is not required to specify
      either the author or the agent responsible for submitting the
      message.  Rather, the agent responsible for submission specifies
      the RFC2821.MailFrom address.  Ultimately the simple basis for
      deciding what address needs to be in the RFC2821.MailFrom is to
      determine what address needs to be informed about transmission-
      level problems (and, possibly, successes.)

   RFC2821.RcptTo

      Set by: Originator

      This specifies the MUA mailbox address of a recipient.  The string
      might not be visible in the message content header.  For example,
      the message destination address header fields, such as RFC2822.To,
      might specify a mailing list address, while the RFC2821.RcptTo
      address specifies a member of that list.

   RFC2821.Received

      Set by: Source

      An MSA can record a Received header field, to indicate initial
      submission trace information, including originating host and MSA
      host domain names and/or IP Addresses.

4.3.2.  Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)

   A Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) relays mail for one application-level
   "hop".  It is like a packet-switch or IP router in that its job is to
   make routing assessments and to move the message closer to the
   Recipient(s).  Relaying is performed by a sequence of MTAs, until the
   message reaches its destination MDA(s).  Hence an MTA implements both
   client and server MTA functionality.  It does not make changes to
   addresses in the envelope or reformulate the editorial content.
   Hence a change in data form, such as to the MIME Content-Transfer-
   Encoding, is within the purview of an MTA, whereas removal or
   replacement of body content is not.  Also it can add trace
   information.  Of course email objects are typically much larger than
   the payload of a packet or datagram, and the end-to-end latencies are
   typically much higher.

   Internet Mail primarily uses SMTP [RFC2821], [RFC0821] to effect
   point-to-point transfers between peer MTAs.  Other transfer
   mechanisms include Batch SMTP [RFC2442] and ODMR [RFC2645].  As with
   most network layer mechanisms Internet Mail's SMTP supports a basic
   level of reliability, by virtue of providing for retransmission after
   a temporary transfer failure.  Contrary to typical packet switches
   (and Instant Messaging services) Internet Mail MTAs typically store
   messages in a manner that allows recovery across service
   interruptions, such as host system shutdown.  However the degree of
   such robustness and persistence by an MTA can be highly variable.

   The primary "routing" mechanism for Internet Mail is the DNS MX
   record [RFC1035], which specifies a host through which the queried
   domain can be reached.  This presumes a public -- or at least a
   common -- backbone that permits any attached host to connect to any
   other.

   An important characteristic of MTA-MTA communications, over the open
   Internet, is that they do not require prior arrangement between the
   independent administrations operating the different MTAs.  Given the
   importance of spontaneity and serendipity in the world of human
   communications, this lack of prearrangement between the participants
   is a core benefit of Internet Mail and remains a core requirement for
   it.

   Identities relevant to the MTA include:

   RFC2821.HELO/.EHLO

      Set by: Relay

      The MTA can specify its hosting domain identity for the SMTP HELO
      or EHLO command.  This is the only standardized way of identifying
      the agent responsible for operation of the Relay, during the
      transfer operation.

   RFC2821.MailFrom

      Set by: Source

      This is an MHS end-to-end string that specifies an email address
      for receiving return control Bounce, such as delivery
      confirmations and error notices.  The protocol name of this field
      is misleading, because it is not required to specify either the
      author or the agent responsible for submitting the message.
      Rather the agent responsible for submission specifies the MailFrom
      address.  Ultimately the simple basis for deciding what address
      needs to be in the RFC2821.MailFrom is to determine what address

      needs to be informed about transmission-level problems (and,
      possibly, successes.)

   RFC2821.RcptTo

      Set by: Originator

      This specifies the MUA mailbox address of a Recipient.  The string
      might not be visible in the message content header.  For example
      the message destination address header fields, such as RFC2822.To,
      might specify a mailing list address, while the RFC2821.RcptTo
      address specifies a member of that list.

   RFC2822.Received

      Set by: Relay

      An MTA can record a Received header field, to indicate trace
      information, including source host and receiving host domain names
      and/or IP Addresses.

4.3.3.  Mail Delivery Agent (MDA)

   A Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) delivers email to the Recipient's
   mailbox.  It can provide distinctive, address-based functionality,
   made possible by its detailed knowledge of the properties of the
   destination address.  This knowledge might also be present elsewhere
   in the Recipient's ADMD, such as at an organizational border
   (Boundary) Relay.  However it is required for the MDA, if only
   because the MDA must know where to deliver the message.

   Using Internet protocols, delivery can be effected by a variety of
   standard protocols.  When coupled with an internal local mechanism,
   SMTP [RFC2821] and LMTP [RFC2033] permit "push" delivery to the
   Recipient system, at the initiative of the upstream email service.
   POP [RFC1939] and IMAP [RFC3501] are used for "pull" delivery at the
   initiative of the Recipient system.  POP and IMAP can also be used
   for repeated access to messages on a remote MS.

   Identities relevant to the MDA include:

   RFC2821.Return-Path

      Set by: Source

Internet-Draft             EMail Architecture               October 2006


      The MDA records the RFC2821.MailFrom address into the
      RFC2822.Return-Path field.

   RFC2822.Received

      Set by: Destination

      An MDA can record a Received header field, to indicate trace
      information, including source host and receiving host domain names
      and/or IP Addresses.


5.  Mediators

   Basic email transfer from an Originator to the specified Recipients
   is accomplished by using an asynchronous, store-and-forward
   communication infrastructure, in a sequence of independent
   transmissions through some number of MTAs.  A very different task is
   a User-level sequence of postings and deliveries, through Mediators.
   A Mediator forwards a message, through a re-posting process.  The
   Mediator does share some functionality with basic MTA relaying, but
   it enjoys a degree of freedom with both addressing and content that
   is not available to MTAs.

   RFC2821.HELO/.EHLO

      Set by: Source or Relay

      The MSA can specify its hosting domain identity for the SMTP HELO
      or EHLO command operation.

   RFC2821.MailFrom

      Set by: Source

      This is an end-to-end string that specifies an email address for
      receiving return control Bounces.  The name of this field is
      misleading, because it is not required to specify either the
      author or the agent responsible for submitting the message.
      Rather the agent responsible for submission specifies the
      RFC2821.MailFrom address.  Ultimately the simple basis for
      deciding what address needs to be in the RFC2821.MailFrom is to
      determine what address needs to be informed about transmission-
      level problems (and, possibly, successes.)

   RFC2821.RcptTo

      Set by: Mediator

      This specifies the MUA mailbox address of a Recipient.  The string
      might not be visible in the message content header.  For example,
      the message destination address header fields, such as RFC2822.To,
      might specify a mailing list address, while the RFC2821.RcptTo
      address specifies a member of that list.

   RFC2821.Received

      Set by: Mediator

      An MSA can record a Received header field, to indicate initial
      submission trace information, including originating host and MSA
      host domain names and/or IP Addresses.

   The salient aspect of a Mediator, that distinguishes it from any
   other MUA creating an entirely new message, is that a Mediator
   preserves the integrity and tone of the original message, including
   the essential aspects of the original origination information.  The
   Mediator might also add commentary.

   Examples of MUA message creation that are NOT performed by Mediators
   include --

   New message that forwards an existing message:

      This action rather curiously provides a basic template for a class
      of Mediators.  However for its typical occurrence it is not itself
      an example of a Mediator.  The new message is viewed as being from
      the Agent doing the forwarding, rather than being from the
      original Originator.

      A new message encapsulates the original message and is seen as
      strictly "from" the Mediator.  The Mediator might add commentary
      and certainly has the opportunity to modify the original message
      content.  The forwarded message is therefore independent of the
      original message exchange and creates a new message dialogue.
      However the final Recipient sees the contained message as from the
      original Originator.

      When a Recipient formulates a response back to the original
      message's author, the new message is not typically viewed as being
      a "forwarding" of the original.  Its focus is the new content,
      although it might contain all or part of the material in the
      original message.  Therefore the earlier material is merely
      contextual and secondary.

   Annotator:

      The integrity of the original message is usually preserved, but
      one or more comments about the message are added in a manner that
      distinguishes commentary from original text.  The tone of the new
      message is that it is primarily commentary from a new Originator,
      similar to a Reply.

   The remainder of this section describes common examples of Mediators.

5.1.  Aliasing

   Aliasing is a simple re-addressing facility, available in most MDA
   implementations.  It is performed just before delivering a message to
   the specified Recipient's mailbox.  Instead the message is submitted
   back to the transfer service, for delivery to one or more alternate
   addresses.  Although implemented as part of the message delivery
   service, this facility is strictly a Recipient user function.  It
   resubmits the message, replacing the envelope address, on behalf of
   the mailbox address that was listed in the envelope.

   What is most distinctive about this forwarding mechanism is how
   closely it compares to normal MTA store-and-forward Relaying.  In
   reality its only interesting difference is that it changes the
   RFC2821.RcptTo value.  Having the change be this small makes it easy
   to view aliasing as a part of the lower-level mail relaying activity.
   However the small change has a large semantic impact: The designated
   recipient has chosen a new recipient.

   Hence that original recipient SHOULD become responsible for any
   handling issues.  This change would be reflected by replacing the
   message's RFC2821.MailFrom address to be one within the scope of the
   ADMD doing the aliasing.

   An MDA that is re-posting a message to an alias typically changes
   only envelope information:

   RFC2822.TO, RFC2822.CC, RFC2822.BCC

Internet-Draft             EMail Architecture               October 2006


      Set by: Originator

      These retain their original addresses.

   RFC2821.RcptTo

      Set by: Mediator

      This field contains an alias address.

   RFC2821.MailFrom

      Set by: Mediator or original Source

      The agent responsible for submission to an alias address will
      often retain the original address to receive handling Bounces.
      The benefit of retaining the original MailFrom value is to ensure
      that the origination-side agent knows that there has been a
      delivery problem.  On the other hand, the responsibility for the
      problem usually lies with the Recipient, since the Alias mechanism
      is strictly under the Recipient's control.

   RFC2821.Received

      Set by: Mediator

      The agent can record Received information, to indicate the
      delivery to the original address and submission to the alias
      address.  The trace of Received header fields can therefore
      include everything from original posting through final delivery to
      the alias.

5.2.  Re-Sending

   Also called Re-Directing, Re-Sending differs from Forwarding by
   virtue of having the Mediator "splice" a message's addressing
   information, to connect the Originator of the original message and
   the Recipient of the new message.  This permits them to have direct
   exchange, using their normal MUA Reply functions.  Hence the new
   Recipient sees the message as being From the original Originator,
   even if the Mediator adds commentary.

   Identities specified in a resent message include

   RFC2822.From

Internet-Draft             EMail Architecture               October 2006


      Set by: original Originator

      Names and email addresses for the original author(s) of the
      message content are retained.  The free-form (display-name)
      portion of the address might be modified to provide informal
      reference to the agent responsible for the redirection.

   RFC2822.Reply-To

      Set by: original Originator

      If this field is present in the original message, it is retained
      in the Resent message.

   RFC2822.Sender

      Set by: original Source

      This field is expected to contain the original Sender value.

   RFC2822.TO, RFC2822.CC, RFC2822.BCC

      Set by: original Originator

      These specify the original message Recipients.

   RFC2822.Resent-From

      Set by: Mediator

      The address of the original Recipient who is redirecting the
      message.  Otherwise the same rules apply for the Resent-From field
      as for an original RFC2822.From field

   RFC2822.Resent-Sender

      Set by: Mediator

      The address of the agent responsible for re-submitting the
      message.  For efficiency this field is often omitted if it
      contains the same address as RFC2822.Resent-From.  However this
      does not mean there is no Resend-Sender specified.  Rather it
      means that that header field is virtual and that the address in
      the Resent-From field MUST be used.  Specification of the error
      return addresses (the Notification address, contained in
      RFC2821.MailFrom) is made by the Resent-Sender.  Typically the
      Bounce address is the same as the Resent-Sender address.  However
      some usage scenarios require it to be different.

   RFC2822.Resent-To, RFC2822.Resent-cc, RFC2822.Resent-bcc:

      Set by: Mediator

      The addresses of the new Recipients who will now be able to reply
      to the original author.

   RFC2821.MailFrom

      Set by: Mediator

      The agent responsible for re-submission (RFC2822.Resent-Sender) is
      also responsible for specifying the new MailFrom address.

   RFC2821.RcptTo

      Set by: Mediator

      This will contain the address of a new Recipient

   RFC2822.Received

      Set by: Mediator

      When resending a message the submission agent can record a
      Received header field, to indicate the transition from original
      posting to resubmission.

5.3.  Mailing Lists

   Mailing lists have explicit email addresses and they forward messages
   to a list of subscribed members.  The Mailing List Actor performs a
   task that can be viewed as an elaboration of the Re-Director role.
   In addition to sending the new message to a potentially large number
   of new Recipients, the Mediator can modify content, such as deleting
   attachments, formatting conversion, and adding list-specific
   comments.  In addition, archiving list messages is common.  Still the
   message retains characteristics of being "from" the original
   Originator.

   Identities relevant to a mailing list processor, when submitting a
   message, include:

   RFC2919.List-Id

Internet-Draft             EMail Architecture               October 2006


      Set by: Mediator

      This provides a global mailing list naming framework that is
      independent of particular hosts.  [RFC2919]

   RFC2369.List-*

      Set by: Mediator

      [RFC2369] defines a collection of message header fields for use by
      mailing lists.  In effect they supply list-specific parameters for
      common mailing list user operations.  The identifiers for these
      operations are for the list, itself, and the user-as-subscriber.
      [RFC2369]

   RFC2822.From

      Set by: original Originator

      Names and email addresses for the original author(s) of the
      message content are specified.

   RFC2822.Reply-To

      Set by: original Originator or Mediator

      Mailing lists have introduced an ambiguity for the Reply-To field.
      Some List operations choose to force all replies to go to all list
      members.  They achieve this by placing the list address into the
      RFC2822.Reply-To field.  Hence direct, "private" replies only to
      the original author cannot be achieved by using the MUA's typical
      "reply to author" function.  If the author created a Reply-To
      field, its information is lost.

   RFC2822.Sender

      Set by: original Source or Mediator

      This will usually specify the address of the agent responsible for
      mailing list operations.  However some mailing lists operate in a
      manner very similar to a simple MTA Relay, so that they preserve
      as much of the original handling information as possible,
      including the original RFC2822.Sender field.

   RFC2822.TO, RFC2822.CC

Internet-Draft             EMail Architecture               October 2006


      Set by: original Originator

      These will usually contain the original list of Recipient
      addresses.

   RFC2821.MailFrom

      Set by: original Source or Mediator

      This can contain the original address to be notified of
      transmission issues, or the mailing list agent can set it to
      contain a new Notification address.  Typically the value is set to
      a new address, so that mailing list members and posters are not
      burdened with transmission-related Bounces.

   RFC2821.RcptTo

      Set by: Mediator

      This contains the address of a mailing list member.

   RFC2821.Received

      Set by: Mediator

      A Mailing List Agent can record a Received header field, to
      indicate the transition from original posting to mailing list
      forwarding.  The Agent can choose to have the message retain the
      original set of Received header fields or can choose to remove
      them.  In the latter case it can ensure that the original Received
      header fields are otherwise available, to ensure later
      accountability and diagnostic access to them.

5.4.  Gateways

   Gateways perform the basic routing and transfer work of message
   relaying, but they also make any message or address modifications
   that are needed to send the message into a messaging environment that
   operates according to different standards or potentially incompatible
   policies.  When a Gateway connects two differing messaging services,
   its role is easy to identify and understand.  When it connects
   environments that have technical similarity, but can have significant
   administrative differences, it is easy to think that a Gateway is
   merely an MTA.  The critical distinction between an MTA and a Gateway
   is that the latter transforms addresses and/or message content, in
   order to map between the standards of two, different messaging
   services.  In virtually all cases, this mapping process results in
   some degree of semantic loss.  The challenge of Gateway design is to

Internet-Draft             EMail Architecture               October 2006


   minimize this loss.

   A Gateway can set any identity field available to a regular MUA.
   Identities typically relevant to Gateways include:

   RFC2822.From

      Set by: original Originator

      Names and email addresses for the original author(s) of the
      message content are retained.  As for all original addressing
      information in the message, the Gateway can translate addresses in
      whatever way will allow them continue to be useful in the target
      environment.

   RFC2822.Reply-To

      Set by: original Originator

      The Gateway SHOULD retain this information, if it is originally
      present.  The ability to perform a successful reply by a Gatewayed
      Recipient is a typical test of Gateway functionality.

   RFC2822.Sender

      Set by: original Source or Mediator

      This can retain the original value or can be set to a new address

   RFC2822.TO, RFC2822.CC, RFC2822.BCC

      Set by: original Recipient

      These usually retain their original addresses.

   RFC2821.MailFrom

      Set by: original Source or Mediator

      The agent responsible for gatewaying the message can choose to
      specify a new address to receive handling notices.

   RFC2822.Received

      Set by: Mediator

Internet-Draft             EMail Architecture               October 2006


      The Gateway can record a Received header field, to indicate the
      transition from original posting to the new messaging environment.

5.5.  Boundary Filter

   Organizations often enforce security boundaries by subjecting
   messages to analysis, for conformance with the organization's safety
   policies.  An example is detection of content classed as spam or a
   virus.  A Filter might alter the content, to render it safe, such as
   by removing content deemed unacceptable.  Typically these actions
   will result in the addition of content that records the actions.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not specify any new Internet Mail functionality.
   Consequently it is not intended to introduce any security
   considerations.

   However its discussion of the roles and responsibilities for
   different mail service modules, and the information they create,
   highlights the considerable security issues that are present when
   implementing any component of the Internet Mail service.  In
   addition, email transfer protocols can operate over authenticated
   and/or encrypted links, and message content can be authenticated or
   encrypted.
