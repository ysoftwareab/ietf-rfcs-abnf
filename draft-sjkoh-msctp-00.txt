Abstract 
    
   This document discusses the use of SCTP for Internet mobility support, 
   called mobile SCTP (mSCTP). SCTP can be used for IP mobility from the 
   multi-homing features. The SCTP with the ADDIP extension (or mSCTP) 
   would provide soft handover for the mobile host without support of 
   routers or agents in the networks. For location management, the mSCTP 
   could be used along with Mobile IP, Session Initiation Protocol or 
   Reliable Server Pooling. We discuss the use of mSCTP along with 
   Mobile IP for Internet mobility support.

1. Introduction  
    
   SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol), as defined in RFC 2960 
   [3], is the third transport layer protocol following TCP and UDP. The 
   SCTP is featured multi-streaming and multihoming, differently from 
   TCP. It is noted that the multihoming feature of SCTP enables the 
   SCTP to support the IP mobility.  
    
   More specifically, the SCTP with the ADDIP extension [4], which is 
   called mobile SCTP (mSCTP) in this document, can be used to provide 
   seamless handover for mobile hosts that are moving into different IP 
   network regions during the active session [5].  
     
   The mSCTP may be used as an alternative scheme against the handover 
   schemes based on Mobile IP [6, 7]. Differently from the Mobile IP 
   based handover schemes, which rely on the support of network routers 
   for tunneling between access routers, the mobile SCTP provides the 
   handover management at the transport layer without help of routers. 
     
   The mSCTP can be used to provide seamless handover for mobile hosts 
   that are moving in to different IP networks. In other words, the 
   mSCTP is targeted for the client-server services, in which the mobile 
   client initiates an SCTP session with the fixed server. For 
   supporting the peer-to-peer services, in which a session is 
   terminated at the mobile host, the mSCTP must be used along with an 
   additional location management scheme such as Mobile IP, Session 
   Initiation Protocol (SIP), Reliable Server Pooling (RSerPool) [8] or 
   Dynamic DNS (DDNS). 
    
   This document describes the architecture of SCTP for IP mobility 
   support. Specifically, we describe the use of SCTP for seamless 
   handover by using the SCTP ADDIP extension [4]. We also discuss how 
   to integrate SCTP with SIP, MIP or RSerPool for location management. 
     
   The mSCTP can also be used to support Internet mobility for the 
   sessions that are initiated by CN toward MN, if it is used along with 
   the Mobile IP [6, 7]. In this case, the Mobile IP is used for 
   location management, and then the mSCTP will be used for seamless 
   handover instead of the MIP-based handover schemes.  
    
   Specifically, Mobile IP will be used only for the CN to find the 
   current location of MN and to establish an SCTP association. Once the 
   SCTP association has been established, the SCTP session will be 
   supported by the mSCTP seamless handover procedures.

2. Motivations  
    
2.1 IP Mobility Issues  
    
   IP mobility issues have been focused and are regarded as a core 
   technology required for providing seamless mobility in the wireless 
   mobile networks such as WLAN, 3G Cellular. IP mobility issues can be 
   classified into Location Management and Handover Management. 
    
Location Management 
    
   Location Management is used to identify the current location of 
   mobile nodes and also to keep track of the their location changes as 
   they move on. 
        
   In Mobile IP, the mobility agents such as Home Agent (HA) and Foreign 
   Agent (only for IPv4) are employed for location management as well as 
   data transport. In the schemes, Home Address (HoA) and Care-of 
   Address (CoA) are used for a terminal identifier and a location 
   identifier of the IP host, respectively. For location management, the 
   Mobile IP uses the binding update messages, in which a mobile node 
   has to inform its current location (CoA) to its HA. 
    
   SIP can also be used for location management. In SIP, a UA registers 
   its new location with the location database via SIP Registrar server 
   by sending an SIP Register message containing a Contact Header. 
    
   So far, the Dynamic DNS (DDNS) has also been discussed as one of the 
   candidate approaches for location management, which would not require 
   special servers or procedures for mSCTP client.  
    
Handover Management 
    
   The handover management is targeted to provide the mobile hosts for 
   seamless handover whenever they change their point of attachment to 
   IP networks (as represented by cell regions or IP subnets). The main 
   objective of the handover management is to minimize the service 
   disruption due to data loss and/or handover latency during handover. 
        
   In Mobile IP, the Low Latency or Fast handover schemes have been 
   designed for handover management. These schemes rely on the tunneling 
   between old and new access routers for seamless handover.  
    
   The mobile SCTP can be used as an alternative scheme against such 
   Mobile IP based handover schemes. Differently from the Mobile IP 
   handover schemes that rely on the help of network routers for 
   tunneling between access routers, the mobile SCTP provides the 
   handover management at the transport layer without help of routers.

2.2 SCTP Multihoming Feature 
    
   The SCTP intrinsically provides the multihoming feature, in which a 
   mobile node is allowed to simultaneously bind multiple IP addresses 
   to its network interface.  
    
   The recent works on the SCTP include the ADDIP extension. The ADDIP 
   extension enables the SCTP to add, delete and change the IP addresses 
   during active SCTP association. 
    
   In this document, the SCTP implementation with the ADDIP extension is 
   called the mobile SCTP (mSCTP). The mSCTP can be used for seamless 
   handover while the mobile node is moving into different IP network 
   regions over the session period. This document aims at discussing the 
   use of mSCTP for seamless handover, which includes the specific 
   handover procedures and associated implementation issues. 
 
 
2.3 Session Type considered in Mobile SCTP 
 
   Sessions considered in mobile communications can be classified into 
   the following two types: 
     
    a. Session originated from mobile host toward fixed host 
    b. Session originated from fixed host toward mobile host 
     
   The mobile sessions in (a) seem to be a natural extension of the 
   client-server model, in which the mobile host originating the session 
   can be viewed as a client, while the counter endpoint will function 
   as a server. 
     
   On the other hand, the case (b) requires the additional location 
   management functionality for the session originator to find the 
   current location of the mobile host and to keep track of the location 
   changes, which has so far been addressed by Mobile IP.  
    
   The mobile SCTP, in the present form, is targeted for seamless 
   handover of mobile session associated with the case (a). To support 
   the session type of the case (b), the mSCTP must be used along with 
   an additional location management scheme such as SIP, Mobile IP or 
   RSerPool.

3. Procedures for mSCTP Handover  
 
   The mSCTP handover needs to be triggered by MC because only the MC 
   knows the movement of itself and the signal strength from the old and 
   new ARs.  
    
   More specifically, we consider a mobile client (MC) that initiates an 
   SCTP association with a fixed server (FS), and then moves from 
   Location A (2.2.2.x domain) to Location B (3.3.3.x domain), as shown 
   in Figure 1.

3.1 Session Initiation by Mobile Client 
 
   We assume that the MC initiates an SCTP association with the FS. The 
   resulting SCTP association has the set of IP addresses with [2.2.2.2] 
   for MC and [1.1.1.2] for FS. It is also assumed that the MC can get 
   an IP address ([2.2.2.2]) with help of DHCP or IPv6 stateless address 
   auto-configuration. 
    
   Note that the FS is in the single homing with [1.1.1.2], and the MC 
   is also in single homing state, in which the IP address [2.2.2.2] is 
   set to its primary IP address in the SCTP initiation process. 
 
 
3.2 Obtaining an IP address for a new location 
 
   Let us assume that the MC moves from Location A to B. In this phase, 
   we also need to assume that the MC can obtain a new IP address 
   belonging to the Location B, which may be possible with help of the 
   DHCP or IPv6 address auto-configuration capability in the Location B. 
    
   Obtaining a new IP address may also rely on the support of the 
   wireless signaling control at the physical layer, in order for the MC 
   to get the IP address information via IP control packets from the 
   Location B. 
    
   By SCTP, the newly obtained IP address ([3.3.3.2] in the figure) MUST 
   be signaled or informed to the SCTP protocol stack, and then the SCTP 
   will bind the new IP address to the existing SCTP association. 
    
    
3.3 Adding the new IP address to the SCTP association 
 
   After obtaining a new IP address, the SCTP of MC MUST inform the 
   Fixed Server about the new IP address by sending Address 
   Configuration Change (ASCONF) Chunk to the FS. The MC may receive the 
   corresponding ASCONF-ACK Chunk from the FS. 
    
 
3.4 Changing the Primary IP address 
 
   While the MC continues to move toward the Location B, it needs to 
   change its primary IP address to the new IP address according at an 
   appropriate rule.  
    
   Actually, the configuration of a specific rule for changing the 
   primary IP address is a challenging issue of the mobile SCTP. 
    

 
 
Koh and Xie            Expires - September 2005               [Page 7] 
                     mSCTP for Internet Mobility           March 2005 
 
 
   Some of the possible rules for triggering the primary IP address 
   change are listed below: 
    
   a. As soon as a new IP address is detected  
        
    When the MC receives the ASCONF-ACK from FS, it sends another 
    ASCONF with "Address Configuration Parameter" set to "Set Primary 
    Address". FS sends back ASCONF-ACK once receives the second ASCONF 
    to confirm the handover successfully. 
     
    This choice may be preferred in terms of the handover latency, in 
    particular, for the fast-moving MC. However, it is less suitable 
    when the MC shows a so-called oscillation (or ping-pong) behavior 
    across those two locations. 
    
   b. By using an explicit indication from the underlying layer  
    
    In this case, the underlying PHY layer of MC detects and compares 
    the signal strength, and determines the time on when the SCTP sends 
    an ASCONF with "Set Primary Address". 
     
    If the underlying physical layer can detect and compare the signal 
    strength of the physical media, and also inform the SCTP about a 
    certain indication (possibly by using a up-call), then the MC may 
    trigger the primary address change according to the indication. 
    
    This rule is a more preferred choice, but seems to depend on the 
    wireless system concerned and its implementations. 
     
   c. By using an indication from the upper layer   
          
    The change of the primary IP address may also be triggered by an 
    indication from the upper layer of the MC.  In particular, this 
    scenario may be considered when an MC is in an overlay mobile 
    communication environment where two or more networks are available 
    at the same time, such as the so-called intersystem handover or 
    vertical handover between WLAN and 3GPPs.  In this case, a vertical 
    handover of the MC can be triggered from an upper layer indication 
    by considering a trade-off between connection bandwidth, coverage 
    and cost from the concerned systems/locations. 
     
   If once the primary address is changed, the FS will send the upcoming 
   data over the new primary IP address. 
    
   There is still a further issue on how the MC should handle the data 
   packets queued in the outgoing buffer with the source IP address of 
   the old primary IP address.

3.5 Deleting the old IP address from the SCTP association 
 
   As the MC progresses to move toward the Location B, if the old IP 
   address gets inactive, the MC MUST delete the IP address from the 
   address list. The rule for determining that the IP address is 
   inactive may also be implemented by using additional information from 
   the underlying network or physical layer, as done in the previous 
   step (for changing the primary address.) 
 
 
3.6 Repeating the handover procedures 
 
   The procedural steps for seamless handover described above will be 
   repeated whenever the MC moves to a new location, until the SCTP 
   association will be released. 
    
   One particular further consideration in the handover procedures is 
   that the adding, primary change and deleting of IP addresses can 
   possibly be performed at the same time, which may depend on a 
   specific implementation of mSCTP or network environment concerned. 
   This issue needs to be investigated for further study. 
    
    
4. Considerations for mSCTP Handover 
 
4.1 Requirement for Mobile SCTP 
 
   The only requirement for providing the seamless handover based on 
   SCTP is that the MC and FS hosts are equipped with the Mobile SCTP 
   implementations, (i.e., SCTP with ADDIP extension.) 
    
    
4.2 Number of IP addresses used by Fixed Server  
 
   In this document, we assume that the FS is in the single homing, i.e. 
   the FS and MC are in a 1-to-2 asymmetric multi-homing configuration. 
   In a certain case, we may need to consider the multi-homed FS.  
    
   It is noted that there are still many further issues on how to handle 
   the mSCTP handover or which is better in the performance aspect for 
   each of the single-homed and multi-homed FS cases. For more 
   information on this issue, refer to [5]. 
 
 
4.3 Dynamic IP address configuration 
    
   The basic assumption for seamless handover to a new IP subnet region 
   is that the MC is able to obtain a new IP address from the new 
   location. Typically, this will be implemented by using DHCP in IPv4

                     mSCTP for Internet Mobility           March 2005 
 
 
   networks and DHCPv6 or Stateless address auto-configuration in IPv6 
   networks.  
    
   The handover latency incurred for obtaining the new IP address via 
   DHCP or IPv6 needs to be examined by experiments. The concerned 
   handover latency also includes the delay required for the handover 
   delay between the wireless links. 
 
 
4.4 AAA Functionality  
 
   It is envisioned that the deployment of mSCTP will be done along with 
   the appropriate AAA server in the respective access network domains. 
   The AAA server is used to authenticate and the MC in the locations, 
   and also to authorize the new IP address configuration via DHCP and 
   IPv6 stateless configuration. However, this issue is outside the 
   scope of this document. 
    
    
4.5 Link Layer Support for Multi-homing 
 
   To support the multi-homing capability for Mobile Client, we need to 
   consider the characteristics of the wireless links such as WLAN and 
   Cellular systems. It is noted that Cellular systems are expected to 
   easily support the link-level multi-homing features, whereas the WLAN 
   system case is for further study. 
    
   The multi-homing feature enables the mSCTP to support seamless 
   handover by simultaneous binding of two different addresses while 
   staying the overlapping region. Time interval for an MC to stay in 
   the overlapping region will give impact on the performance of the 
   handover procedures. 
 
   It is also noted that the handover based on mSCTP depends on the 
   support of the underlying physical and link layers to measure the 
   wireless signal strength. The measured signal strength information 
   can helpfully used for the SCTP to trigger the addition and deletion 
   of IP addresses, and the change of the primary address. The handover 
   performance will depend on such capability in terms of data loss and 
   delay during handover. 
 
 
5. Location Management for mSCTP  
    
   The mSCTP can provide only the handover for mobile hosts or the 
   sessions initiated by mobile hosts. To support the mobile sessions 
   that are terminated at mobile hosts, the mSCTP needs to be used along 
   with a location management scheme such as Mobile IP or SIP.

5.1 Mobile IP 
    
   In this scenario, Mobile IP will be used to locate a mobile host and 
   then for Home Agent to forward the data packet (SCTP INIT chunk) to 
   the mobile host. The succeeding process for SCTP association 
   initiation, including SCTP INIT-ACK, COOKIE-ECHO, and COOKIE-ACK, 
   will be done directly between the mobile host and the peering host, 
   not via Home Agent.  
    
   After an SCTP association is successfully setup, the mSCTP will be 
   used for providing seamless handover for the mobile host. 
    
    
5.2 SIP 
    
   In this scenario, each host uses SCTP instead of TCP/UDP as the 
   transport protocol. After the call setup by SIP signaling, the SCTP 
   will be used for data transport and seamless handover. 
    
   The SIP provides location management functionality by using SIP 
   REGISTER messages. When a mobile host moves into a visiting network, 
   it will update its current location (e.g., IP address or SIP URL) by 
   sending a SIP Register (with a Contact Header) to the (home) SIP 
   Registrar server. The Registrar server will then update the location 
   database as indicated by the REGISTER message. 
    
   When a call setup is requested with a mobile host, the (home) SIP 
   proxy server will interrogate the location database to locate the 
   mobile host and then relay the SIP INVITE message to the (visiting) 
   SIP Proxy server up to the mobile host. If once the SCTP association 
   is established via the SIP signaling, the data transport between two 
   concerned hosts will be done according to the mSCTP handover 
   mechanisms. 
    
    
5.3 RSerPool 
        
   RSerPool [11] can be used for location management. A mobile server 
   registers a pool handle such that it becomes part of a pool. It is 
   allowed that a pool consists of one pool element only. A client 
   (mobile or not) must know the pool handle of the mobile server it 
   wants to talk to. It sends a name resolution request to one of the 
   ENRP servers and gets back the current IP-addresses. Since the ENRP 
   servers within an operational scope share its state it is not 
   important which ENRP server is contacted. If the MS changes its IP-
   address it re registers at the home ENRP server.

                     mSCTP for Internet Mobility           March 2005 
 
 
   So the pool handles can be used to address a server with changing IP-
   addresses. If the MC or the MS change their addresses due to 
   handovers mSCTP can be used to handle this, except for the case were 
   the MC and the MS change their addresses simultaneously. In this case 
   mSCTP fails i.e. the SCTP association terminates. The RSerPool 
   session concept can be used to reestablish a new SCTP association 
   using the new addresses and continuing the RSerPool session. 
   Depending on the application the impact of this session failover for 
   the application can be very small.

   As described in Table 1, the mSCTP can be used for seamless handover 
   in the transport layer. To use mSCTP, it is required that the CN and 
   MN hosts should be aware of the mobile SCTP. Instead, mSCTP does not 
   need the support of network routers for seamless handover. 
   Furthermore, the mSCTP intrinsically provides the Route Optimization 
   without using any additional Binding Update procedures.

                     mSCTP for Internet Mobility           March 2005 
 
 
   For location management, the mSCTP may be used along with MIP or SIP. 
   In case of using MIP for location management, only the MN needs to be 
   aware of MIP, whereas the CN need not use MIP. Using mSCTP with MIP, 
   the MN must also be able to bind the CoA as well as HoA to its 
   applications. The HoA will be used only for location management. 
   After establishment of an SCTP session, the HoA will not be used for 
   data transport. Instead, the CoA is employed for the SCTP data 
   transport. On the other hand, in MIP, only HoA is bound to the 
   applications of MN regardless of the different CoAs. 
    
   The MIP provides the location and management in the network layer, 
   and it can support seamless handover with help of neighboring routers 
   such as tunneling between old and new ARs. On the other hand, SIP is 
   an application signaling protocol that supports the location 
   management for user or personal mobility. SIP itself does not provide 
   seamless handover. It may be used together with mSCTP for seamless 
   handover.    
    
   Reliable Server Pooling can be used to provide the location 
   management functionality. Used in combination with mSCTP it provides 
   all functionalities required for a mobility solution. Simultaneous 
   handovers of a MS and a MC will result in a session failover. 
    
    
6. Use of mSCTP with Mobile IP  
    
   For the present, the use of mSCTP with MIP is focused on the mobile 
   sessions that are initiated by CN to MN. The sessions initiated by MN 
   can be supported only by mobile SCTP. Specifically, Mobile IP will be 
   used only for location management, by which the CN locates the 
   location of MN and establishes an SCTP association. Once the SCTP 
   association has been established, the on-going SCTP session will be 
   supported by the mSCTP seamless handover procedures. 
    
   A part of the MIP functionality for data transport, will not be used 
   in SCTP with MIP. If once the association is established, the data 
   transport between MN and CN relies on SCTP over IP. The tunneling 
   between HA and MN is not used. Furthermore, the Home Address (HoA) of 
   MN is not used for the data transport. Note that the HoA is used for 
   only the location management. 
    
    
6.1 Basic SCTP Initialization 
    
   When the CN has the knowledge of the current location of the MN, the 
   basic SCTP initialization, as described in RFC 2960 is done from CN 
   to MN as follow (also see Figure 2): 
    
     a. CN sends INIT chunk to MN for triggering the association setup.

     b. MN responds with INIT-ACK chunk to CN. 
    
     c. Then, CN and MN exchange COOKIE-ECHO and COOKIE-ACK each other.

                    |<--------------------| 
    
                 
                Figure 2. SCTP Initialization 
    
   As shown in the figure, the establishment of an SCTP association is 
   ready by exchanging INIT and INIT-ACK and completed by exchanging 
   COOKIE-ECHO and COOKIE-ACK between CN and MN. 
    
    
6.2 Association Initiation in mSCTP with Mobile IP 
    
   In Mobile IP, the HA will have information on the current location of 
   an MN, which is updated by Registration or Binding Update procedures 
   of the MN located at a foreign link. The location management of 
   Mobile IP can be used to convey the INIT chunk message of CN to the 
   MN via HA. 
    
   After receiving the INIT chunk, the MN responds with INIT-ACK chunk 
   directly to CN (not by way of HA) so as to complete the initiation of 
   SCTP association. The responding INIT-ACK must contain the CCoA (in 
   MIPv4) or CoA (in MIPv6), which can be addressable to the MN. 
    
   Mobile IPv4 considers two options to represent the location of the 
   foreign link: CoA and CCoA. The CoA is the IP address of FA (possibly 
   a router), whereas the CCoA is dynamically assigned by using an 
   address allocation mechanism such as DHCP. 
    
   Unfortunately, the CoA in MIPv4 cannot be applicable to SCTP, since 
   it is an address of FA and thus cannot be used within the MN host 
   (for its SCTP association). Note that SCTP is an end-to-end transport

   layer protocol, not a network-layer one. On the other hand, the CCoA 
   in MIPv4 can be used within the SCTP hosts. Specifically, the SCTP of 
   MN could bind the CCoA to an SCTP association. For this reason, in 
   this document, we focus on the use of SCTP over MIPv4 for the MN 
   hosts with CCoA in a foreign link. The case of using CoA is for 
   further study. 
    
   Let us consider an example of MIPv4 networks, which consists of CN, 
   MN and HA. The MN is now at Location A (a foreign link), and will 
   then move into Location B, as shown in Figure 3.

   We assume that the MN has already obtained a CCoA ([2.2.2.2]) from 
   the DHCP server attached to AR1, and also registered the CCoA with HA 
   by using the MIPv4 Registration Procedures. 
    
   We also assume that the applications of MN can initially bind the 
   CCoA as well as HoA via the socket interface. After initialization of

   SCTP association, the HoA may be released from the application, as 
   described below. It is noted that the HoA will still be used for MN 
   to update its new CCoAs to HA according to the MIPv4 mechanisms. 
    
   Now the CN initiates an SCTP association with the MN by sending INIT 
   chunk message over HoA ([1.1.1.2]). The INIT chunk will first be 
   routed to HA, and the HA then forwards the INIT chunk to MN by 
   referring to CCoA ([2.2.2.2]) and using a tunneling mechanism.

             Figure 4. SCTP Initiation in SCTP with MIPv4 
    
    
   In response to the INIT chunk, the MN sends INIT-ACK chunk to the CN. 
   The INIT-ACK contains the CCoA address (as the Primary address) and 
   HoA address. Here, the HoA address may only be used for the CN to 
   check whether the responding MN is the authorized host or not (for 
   somewhat security reason). In fact, the HoA will not be referred to 
   by CN. The source address and destination address of IP packet 
   containing the INIT-ACK chunk are CCoA [2.2.2.2] and CN [1.1.1.2], 
   respectively. 
    
   In turn, the COOKIE-ECHO and COOKIE-ACK chunks will be exchanged 
   between CN and MN.  
    
6.3 Data Transport and Handover during the Association 
 
   After the association is established, the CN transmits data chunks to 
   MN over the CCoA address, and the MN sends data chunks to CN directly.

   When the MN moves from Location A to Location B, the MN gets a new 
   CCoA address [3.3.3.2] from Location B. According to the MIPv4 
   mechanism, the MN will update its new location to HA, which is done 
   in the Mobile IP layer regardless of the on-going SCTP association.  
    
   On the other hand, the MN will perform the seamless handover, as it 
   moves into a new IP subnet area, according to the mobile SCTP by 
   adding the new IP address to the on-going association. These 
   procedures will be repeated until the association has been completed. 
    
 
6.4 Usage Scenarios for SCTP with Mobile IPv6 
 
   The usage scenarios for SCTP with MIPv6 are similar to those for SCTP 
   with MIPv4 that are described so far. 
    
   In MIPv6, the CoA is used instead of CCoA in MIPv4. The CoA may be 
   obtained from the foreign location via DHCPv6 or stateless address 
   auto-configuration. 
 
 
6.5 Discussion 
 
   This section discusses comparison of SCTP/MIP with the MIP-only 
   scheme and some issues. Again, this comparison is valid for the 
   mobile sessions that are initiated by CN toward to MN. 
    
Requirements for SCTP over Mobile IP  
    
   The requirement for using SCTP over Mobile IP is that the CN and MN 
   hosts must be aware of the mobile SCTP. In addition, the MN must be 
   able to bind the CoA as well as HoA to its applications. In MIP, only 
   HoA is bound to the applications of MN. 
    
    
Route Optimization  
 
   The SCTP intrinsically provides the route optimization for data 
   transport between CN and MN. No additional route optimization 
   procedures are required, differently from MIPv4. No binding update 
   between MN and CN is needed, differently from MIPv6. As a result, the 
   tunneling of data packets between HA and MN is not required too. 
    
    
Other Issues 
 
   In the proposed scheme for use of SCTP over MIP, the home address 
   (HoA) of MN is not involved in the data transport between CN and MN. 
   The reason for this is to exploit the intrinsic route optimization

   feature of mobile SCTP. Note that the additional tunneling or binding 
   update procedures are required in case that the HoA is used in the 
   SCTP association. 
    
   The HoA may be used as a backup IP address in the event of path 
   failure of the primary address, CCoA or CoA. This is for further 
   study. 
 
    
Security Considerations 
    
   This document discusses architecture of SCTP mobility support. The 
   associated security issues will be identified as further works go on.
