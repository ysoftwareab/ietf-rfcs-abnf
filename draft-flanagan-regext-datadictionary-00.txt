                          DNS Data Dictionary
                draft-flanagan-regext-datadictionary-00

Abstract

   Multiple applications related to the domain name system are built
   around a list of data elements.  There is currently no unified public
   list of these data elements, nor is there an organized and
   independent change control process.  This document codifies the
   multiple similar but not quite identical lists of data elements into
   a neutral DNS Data Dictionary to be maintained as an independent IANA
   Registry.

1.  Introduction

   The DNS Data Dictionary provides a common set of names and
   definitions for data elements which may be used in a DNS related
   protocol.  The dictionary is intended to be inclusive and[*] not
   obligatory.  That is, the existence of a data element in this
   dictionary does not imply the data element must be used or recognized
   in any particular protocol.  We also expect that each application or
   protocol may have additional requirements specific to the application
   or protocol.  Such additional requirements should be documented as
   part of the application or protocol specification.

   The data dictionary currently has thirty-one data elements.  These
   data elements include the DNS records, the detailed status of a
   registration to the details for each of the contacts, and the account
   details and payment history.  The proposed IANA registry lists
   standard data elements and their syntax for inclusion in the files.

   We expect the DNS data dictionary to evolve to meet the needs of
   various applications.  With the exception of correction of errors, we
   expect the changes to the DNS Data Dictionary to be additions as
   opposed to deletions or changes.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Data Element Specification

   Each data element is a single unit of information that can be
   collected and compared during the registration process.  The primary
   purposes of the IANA registry of data elements are to ensure that
   each data element is assigned a unique name and that the syntax of
   each data element is specified.

   Each data element is assigned to an element type to organize the
   taxonomy of the data dictionary.

   The name of the data element MUST be unique and this characteristic
   MUST be enforced by the registry.  The character encoding
   recommendation for data elements is specified in Section 3.

   The subsections below comprise an initial list of known data elements
   commonly being used in the templates.  The title of the subsection is
   the data element name for the data element.  The combination of data
   element type and data element name MUST be unique and MUST be
   processed as case insensitive in the IANA registry.

2.1.  Element name: Domain Name

   This is the domain name in an EPP [RFC5731] domain object and it MUST
   be in A-Label format.

2.2.  Element name: Registry

   The name of the registry.  This data element is text/string with no
   naming convention enforced.

2.3.  Element name: NS

   The authoritative name server for the domain.[RFC1034]

2.4.  Element name: Registration Creation Date

   The EPP status code (<domain:crDate>) for the domain registration
   creation date.[RFC5731]

2.5.  Element name: Registration Expiration Date

   The EPP status code (<domain:exDate>) for the domain registration
   expiration date.[RFC5731]

2.6.  Element name: Registration Updated Date

   The EPP status code (<domain:upDate>) for the domain registration
   updated date.[RFC5731]

2.7.  Element name: Registration Transfer Date

   The EPP status code (<domain:trDate>) for the domain registration
   transfer date.[RFC5731]

3.  IANA Considerations

   This section describes the format of the IANA Registration Report

   Registry, which has two tables described below, and the procedures

   used to populate and manage the registry entries.

Internet-Draft             DNS Data Dictionary              October 2021


3.1.  Report Specification

   This registry uses the "Specification Required" policy described in
   [RFC8126].  An English language version of the extension
   specification is required in the registry, though non-English
   versions of the specification may also be provided.

   The "Specification Required" policy implies review by a "designated
   expert".  Section 5.2 of RFC 8126 describes the role of designated
   experts and the function they perform.

3.1.1.  Designated Expert Evaluation Criteria

   A high-level description of the role of the designated expert is
   described in Section 5.2 of RFC 8126.  Specific guidelines for the
   appointment of designated experts and the evaluation of a new data
   element is provided here.

   The IESG SHOULD appoint a small pool of individuals (perhaps 3 - 5)
   to serve as designated experts, as described in Section 5.2 of RFC
   8126.  The pool should have a single administrative chair who is
   appointed by the IESG.  The designated experts should use the
   existing regext mailing list (regext@ietf.org) for public discussion
   of registration requests.  This implies that the mailing list should
   remain open after the work of the REGEXT working group has concluded.

   The results of the evaluation should be shared via email with the
   registrant and the regext mailing list.  Issues discovered during the
   evaluation can be corrected by the registrant, and those corrections
   can be submitted to the designated experts until the designated
   experts explicitly decide to accept or reject the registration
   request.  The designated experts must make an explicit decision and
   that decision must be shared via email with the registrant and the
   regext mailing list.  If the specification for a data element or
   report is an IETF Standards Track document, no review is required by
   the designated expert.

   Designated experts should be permissive in their evaluation of
   requests for data elements and reports that have been implemented and
   deployed by at least one registry.  This implies that it may indeed
   be possible to register multiple data elements or reports that
   provide the same functionality.  Requests to register data elements
   or reports that have not been deployed should be evaluated with a
   goal of reducing duplication.  A potential registrant who submits a
   request to register a new data element or report that includes
   similar functionality to existing data elements or reports should be
   made aware of the existing data elements and reports.  The registrant
   should be asked to reconsider their request given the existence of



Flanagan & Crocker       Expires April 14, 2022                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft             DNS Data Dictionary              October 2021


   similar data elements or reports.  Should they decline to do so,
   perceived similarity should not be a sufficient reason for rejection
   as long as all other requirements are met.

3.1.2.  Registration Procedure

   The registry contains information describing each registered data
   element or report.  Registry entries are created and managed by
   sending forms to IANA that describe the data element or report for
   the registry entry.

3.1.2.1.  Required Information

   The required information must be formatted consistently using the
   following registration form.  Form field names and values may appear
   on the same line.

3.1.2.1.1.  Data Element Definition

   Name of data element type

   MUST be unique within the registry, enforced to be unique, and MUST
   be processed as case insensitive

   Name of data element

   MUST be unique within the registry, enforced to be unique, and MUST
   be processed as case insensitive

   Reference document

   MUST define the data element, SHOULD be a URL to a RFC, and SHOULD
   include the section number (or other detailed internal document
   reference), MAY be a URL to any document available under equivalent
   terms

   Registrant

   Will be IESG for initial entries and all Standards Track
   specifications; otherwise as specified by the registran

   Status

   MUST be one of active, inactive, or unknown

Internet-Draft             DNS Data Dictionary              October 2021


3.1.2.2.  Registration Processing

   Registrants should send each registration form to IANA with a single
   record for incorporation into the registry.  Send the form via email
   to iana@iana.org or complete the online form found on the IANA web
   site.  The subject line should indicate whether the enclosed form
   represents an insertion of a new record (indicated by the word
   "INSERT" in the subject line) or a replacement of an existing record
   (indicated by the word "MODIFY" in the subject line).  At no time can
   a record be deleted from the registry.  On receipt of the
   registration request, IANA will initiate review by the designated
   expert(s) if appropriate, who will evaluate the request using the
   criteria in Section 3.1.1 in consultation with the regext mailing
   list.

3.1.2.3.  Updating Report Definition Registry Entries

   When submitting changes to existing registry entries, include text in
   the "Notes" field of the registration form describing the change.
   Under normal circumstances, registry entries are only to be updated
   by the registrant.  If the registrant becomes unavailable or
   otherwise unresponsive, the designated expert can submit a
   registration form to IANA to update the registrant information.
   Entries can change state from "Active" to "Inactive" and back again
   as long as state-change requests conform to the processing
   requirements identified in this document.  In addition to entries
   that become "Inactive" due to a lack of implementation, entries for
   which a specification becomes consistently unavailable over time
   should be marked "Inactive" by the designated expert until the
   specification again becomes reliably available.

3.2.  Initial assignments

4.  Security Considerations

   This specification does not consider the issues of distribution or
   access to the reports that are created and thus does not introduce
   any new security oncerns that are not already present in the local
   environment in which the report is created.

   A security principle to keep in mind as new reports are developed is
   that it is considered a bad practice to report or disclose security
   information.  In the case of the registration system upon which this
   reporting mechanism is based, the authInfo code is a specific example
   of a data element that SHOULD NOT be included in a report.

5.  Privacy Considerations

   This specification defines a mechanism for policy comparison based on
   data in a registration system.  Some of that data is likely to be
   considered personally identifiable information (PII) and thus would
   be subject to privacy protection according to an applicable privacy
   regulation.  It is outside the scope of this specification to address
   those specific concerns.  Implementors are urged to consider these

   issues with their local legal authority and develop appropriate
   requirements for their work.

6.  Internationalization Considerations

   The character encoding for the file contents MUST use UTF-8.
   Throughout this document A-LABEL is indicated as a SHOULD and that
   MUST be interpreted as follows.  All domain name labels MUST be in
   A-LABEL format if it is possible to represent it as an A-LABEL,
   otherwise U-LABEL MAY be used.
