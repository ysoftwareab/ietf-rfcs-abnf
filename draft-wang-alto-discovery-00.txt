1. Introduction 

   Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) service aims to provide 
   distributed network applications with information to perform better-
   than-random initial peer selection when multiple peers in the network 
   are available to provide a resource or service. A discovery mechanism 
   is needed for the applications to find a suitable entity that 
   provides the ALTO service. This document discusses various scenarios 
   of ALTO discovery, provides a survey of available options, and 
   addresses potential issues and consideration for each. 

1.1. Status of this Memo 

   The ALTO service architecture and protocol are currently under 
   discussion and development within the IETF ALTO working group.

   Although it is identified in the charter that a discovery mechanism 
   is needed, the preference is to adopt one or more existing mechanisms 
   for ALTO discovery rather than designing a new one. Note though 
   certain design decisions of the final ALTO framework will affect the 
   selection of discovery mechanisms. As a result, this document makes 
   minimum assumptions of the ALTO framework, and presents different 
   scenarios and available options based on prior and related discovery 
   mechanisms. This document will be updated to track the progress of 
   the ALTO requirements and solution. 

2. Conventions used in this document 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119]. 

3. Scenarios for ALTO Service Discovery 

   This section explores the various dimensions of the ALTO service 
   deployment and access scenarios, and briefly discusses their 
   implications to the discovery mechanisms. Figure 1 below shows a 
   generic ALTO framework diagram with discovery. The terminology is 
   defined in [ALTO-PS].

   In addition to the generic ALTO descriptions, the following terms are 
   used to describe the discovery mechanisms in this document: 

   o  ALTO Discovery Client: The logical entity discovering the ALTO 
      Service. Depending on the scenario, this could be a Peer or a 
      Super-peer. 

   o  ALTO Discovery Server: The logical entity providing information to 
      locate the ALTO Service. Depending on the discovery mechanism, 
      this could be another Peer or a dedicated entity in the network. 

   o  ALTO Discovery Domain: The scope of the network handled by a 
      particular ALTO Discovery Server. 

3.1. ALTO Service Provider 

   The ALTO service could be provided in a distributed and cooperative 
   fashion by the Peers in an overlay, or it can be provided by a 
   centralized entity (the ALTO Server) for a given scope. In the former 
   case, a DHT-style key-based routing algorithm is commonly used to 
   locate the peers with the target network information in this type of 
   distributed environment. For the latter case, where a centralized 
   ALTO Server is implicitly or explicitly assigned to a specific 
   network scope, an out-of-band discovery mechanism is often required. 
   All current ALTO solution proposals, ([Infoexp], [P4P]), fall into 
   the second category. 

3.2. ALTO Service Location 

   The ALTO Server for a Peer could be in the same Local Area Network 
   (LAN), within the same ISP Network but not on the same LAN, or in the 
   Global Internet outside the ISP Network. Different network scopes 
   place different constraints on the discovery mechanisms. Multicast 
   discovery generally works within a single LAN only, whereas DNS-based 
   or DHCP-based discovery can span multiple subnets within a single ISP 
   or a single network administrative domain. Internet scope discovery 
   usually requires cross-domain indexing or directory services. Note 
   that peers participating in a single P2P application may reside on 
   the same or different ISP networks. Scenarios like this may require 
   hybrid discovery solutions that can adapt to multiple network scopes 
   at the same time. The discovery mechanisms listed in this document 
   should take into account possible limitations of the ALTO service 
   deployment in those network scopes.

Internet-Draft         ALTO Discovery Protocols              March 2009 
    

3.3. ALTO Service Clients 

   The ALTO Client can be the Peer in the end-user host or an external 
   entity like a Super-peer or Resource Directory on behalf of the Peer. 
   [ALTO-PS] If a Super-Peers acts as an ALTO Client, it needs to know 
   and select the suitable ALTO Service for the Peer being served. The 
   location of the ALTO Server could be communicated from the Peer to 
   the Super-Peer using the application protocol. It could also be 
   discovered by the Super-Peer from other Peer information received 
   implicitly (like the Peer public IP address) or received explicitly. 
   There could be scenarios where only the Peer is able to access to the 
   ALTO Service, for example if the ALTO Server is located in a private 
   network or in case the ALTO Server requires to receive the ALTO 
   Queries from the Peer which network information is being queried. 

3.4. When is ALTO Service Discovered and Accessed 

   The discovery process takes place before the first access to the ALTO 
   server. This discovery process could be done at host network 
   initialization time, at application initialization time or just 
   before the first ALTO query is sent. 

4. Options for ALTO Service Discovery 

4.1. Manual 

   Manual configuration of the ALTO service location(s) could work in a 
   single ISP network scope, but is not scalable when multiple ISPs or 
   cross-domain ALTO services are required. P2P applications often 
   connect peers from ISPs that they may not have contacted before, and 
   manual configuration will not work without any prior knowledge of the 
   ALTO servers. 

4.2. DHCP 

   In environments where the access network itself either deploys an 
   ALTO server or knows a third party that operates an ALTO server, DHCP 
   [RFC2131] can provide the end host with a domain name. This domain 
   name can then used as input to a DNS-based resolution mechanism 
   described in Section 4.3. 

   The DHCP mechanism seems adequate for an ALTO Service Discovery as it 
   defines the delivery of host-specific configuration from a DHCP 
   server to a host. Also the placement close to the end host is 
   advantageous as local knowledge is important for the ALTO Service. 
   Commonly a DHCP procedure is executed by hosts (Peers) each time they 
   connect to an access network and thus to a new ALTO discovery domain.

Internet-Draft         ALTO Discovery Protocols              March 2009 
    

   Network providers who are interested in providing an ALTO Service can 
   introduce and enable this mechanism in their DHCP servers. 

   The DHCP based ALTO Discovery mechanism needs to define the IANA 
   registration of IPv4 and IPv6 options [RFC2939] for the delivery of 
   the host-specific of the ALTO service configuration. 

   As DHCP is limited to a broadcast domain, DHCP relaying must be 
   considered. 

   Examples of DHCP based mechanisms are the discovery of a Location-to-
   Service Translation LoST Service [RFC5223] or the configuration of a 
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Server [RFC3361] 

4.3. DNS 

   DNS infrastructure can be used to discover the location of entities 
   providing the ALTO service.  The DNS discovery methods described in 
   this section require a domain name as input that can be determined 
   making use of the mechanisms discussed in Section 4.6. 

   NAPTR [RFC3402] and SRV [RFC2782] DNS resource records are 
   appropriate to provide service discovery mechanisms.   The concrete 
   application of these resource records depends on the final ALTO 
   requests/response protocol, but S-NAPTR [RFC3958] and U-NAPTR 
   [RFC4848] provides a generic standardized solution that could be used 
   for the ALTO discovery use case. S-NAPTR and U-NAPTR mechanisms 
   provide a Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Application to 
   map domain name, service name and protocol name to a target host and 
   port or to a target URI. 

   An ALTO service discovery mechanism could be defined just using NAPTR 
   records or just using SRV records, but the combination of both 
   provides and additional indirection level and more flexibility as 
   described in [RFC3958] Section 5. 

   The use of NAPTR records for ALTO discovery requires the definition 
   of an Application Service tag and an Application Protocol tag that 
   must be IANA-registered.  

   The next example shows a NAPTR record for the ALTO service in the 
   example.com domain. This record references the HTTP URI where the 
   ALTO service using the PROTOCOL_A is located:

   example.com. 
    ;; order pref flags 
    IN NAPTR 100 10 "u" "ALTO:PROTOCOL_A" ( ; service 
    "!*.!http://alto.example.com/service.cgi!" ; regex 
    . ; replacement 
    ) 
    
   The next example shows a NAPTR record for the ALTO service in the 
   example.com domain. This NAPTR record references a SRV domain name 
   for the ALTO service using the PROTOCOL_B.  This SRV record could be 
   dereferenced to obtain the target host and port where the service can 
   be located: 

   example.com. 
    ;; order pref flags 
    IN NAPTR 100 10 "s" "ALTO:PROTOCOL_B" ( ; service 
    "" ; regex 
    _protocol_b._tcp.example.com. ; replacement 
    ) 
    ;; prior weight port target 
   IN SRV 10 0 8888 alto.example.com 
    
   There are some advantages of using DNS-based discovery: 

   o  DNS infrastructure is widely deployed, probed and available. 

   o  Most of the end user equipment already include DNS protocol 
      implementations. 

   DNS service discovery is used in IETF protocols for example to locate 
   SIP servers [RFC3263] or to locate LIS servers [GeoprivDisc] and also 
   in other protocols like bittorrent to discover local trackers [BEP-
   22]. 

4.4. Multicast (IP) 

   IP-multicast-based discovery generally works in two ways: 

   1. Clients send out multicast discovery requests and listen for 
      responses (usually unicast) from available servers or service 
      providers. 

   2. Servers or service providers send out multicast announcements when 
      they become available or periodically, and clients waits for the 
      next available multicast announcement to identify the servers or 
      service providers. 

 
 
Garcia, Tomsu, Wang   Expires September 3, 2009                [Page 7] 

Internet-Draft         ALTO Discovery Protocols              March 2009 
    

   The on-demand requests and periodic announcements are not mutually 
   exclusive. An implementation can choose to utilize both 
   simultaneously. The configuration effort of multicast discovery is 
   fairly straightforward, only the multicast address and port are 
   needed. Service types and additional information are often encoded in 
   the requests or announcements messages, enabling the same multicast 
   channel to support discovery of different resources or services. 
   There are two main constraints of multicast-based discovery - scopes 
   and flooding messages. Routers disable multicast forwarding by 
   default, making it practically a single-subnet solution. Some forms 
   of discovery proxies are needed to extend the scope of multicast 
   discovery to multiple subnets. The second issue is the flooding of 
   multicast messages to all hosts on the same subnet. The total 
   bandwidth consumed by multicast depends on the arrival rate the 
   client application requests, and/or the frequency of the service 
   announcements. Older generations of 802.11-based wireless access 
   points often slow down the transmission of multicast messages or 
   generally have a higher packet loss rate for those, causing some 
   multicast discovery implementation to automatically re-send multicast 
   requests or announcements by default. This mitigation further 
   increases the amount of flooding messages on the LAN. Examples of 
   multicast-based discovery include [mDNS], [SSDP], [WSD], SLP 
   [RFC2165], and LLMNR [RFC4795]. 

4.5. XRDS 

   [XRDS] (eXtensible Resource Descriptor Sequence), and its simplified 
   profile [XRDS-Simple], specifies an XML format to describe resources 
   associated with a URI, and the protocol to retrieve that XML 
   document.   One of the purposes of this XRDS document is to enumerate 
   and describe the service endpoints associated with the resource, 
   including the URI to access the service and a a type of service 
   and/or media-type identifying the service being discovered. 

   The use of XRDS for ALTO Service Discovery requires using a URI to 
   retrieve the XRDS document and the specification of a type of service 
   and/or media-type identifying the ALTO Service.  This is an example 
   of a XRDS document including a possible the description of the ALTO 
   service:

Internet-Draft         ALTO Discovery Protocols              March 2009 
    

     <XRDS xmlns="xri://$xrds"> 
       <XRD xmlns="xri://$XRD*($v*2.0)" version="2.0"> 
         <Type>xri://$xrds*simple</Type> 
         <Service> 
           <Type>http://ietf.org/rfcxxx</Type> 
           <MediaType>application/xml+alto</MediaType> 
           <URI>http://alto.example.com/</URI> 
         </Service> 
       </XRD> 
     </XRDS> 
    
   The necessity of an initial URI to retrieve the XRDS document 
   requires an additional pre-discovery mechanism similar to the 
   discovery of the ALTO service itself.  This extra complexity and 
   roundtrip seems to make XRDS not especially appropriate for the ALTO 
   discovery use case. 

4.6. IP and Domain discovery 

   Some of the mechanisms described in the previous sections require the 
   knowledge of the domain name representing the entity providing the 
   ALTO service for this endpoint or the knowledge of the endpoint IP 
   Address. 

   The domain name associated with the entity providing the ALTO service 
   could be manually configured in the end user application or extracted 
   automatically from the endpoint domain name obtained through a 
   reverse DNS lookup process (using DNS PTR records) or from a DHCP 
   server ([RFC4702] for DHCPv4, [RFC4704] for DHCPv6). In case the 
   endpoint domain name is used, the application tries to get the ALTO 
   service for that domain name; if this request fails it removes 
   iteratively the labels from the left of the domain name until an 
   answer to the service location request is successful. The process 
   ends notifying an error when the only label in the domain name is the 
   top level domain. 

   For example in case of an endpoint with a public address 80.80.80.80, 
   it requests the DNS PTR record at 80.80.80.in-addr.arpa. obtaining a 
   domain name like pc1.network1.example.com. The application requests 
   the ALTO service for that domain making a DNS SRV request for 
   alto.tcp.pc1.network1.example.com.  In case that request fails, the 
   application makes a new request for alto.tcp.network1.example.com. 
   and then for alto.tcp.example.com. stopping when a successful answer 
   is returned. 

   To discover the domain name using reverse DNS lookups, the 
   application requires first the knowledge of the endpoint IP address.

Internet-Draft         ALTO Discovery Protocols              March 2009 
    

   In presence of Network Address Translation (NAT) this could be done 
   using mechanisms specific of the application (for example asking an 
   application server using the application specific protocol like [BEP-
   24] in case of a Bittorrent protocol) or using additional standard 
   protocols like STUN, UPnP or NAT-PMP that require additional servers 
   in the network or impose additional requirements in the routers 
   implementing the NATs. 

   Similar Domain Name and IP resolution mechanisms have been described 
   in other discovery mechanisms like the BitTorrent Local Tracker 
   Discovery Protocol [BEP-22]. 

5. Security Considerations 

   The security considerations for the ALTO discovery protocol will be 
   detailed in further versions of this document after the final 
   discovery mechanism will be selected. 

   In case of DHCP security consideration needs to be taken into account 
   as a client accepts configuration responses from any server. 

   The security considerations for the DNS discovery mechanisms depend 
   on the Resource Records in use.  U-NAPTR security considerations are 
   detailed in [RFC4848] and those for SRV in [RFC2782].  The security 
   of the IP and Domain discovery described in 4.6.  must also be 
   considered. 

   Each multicast discovery mechanism has specific security 
   considerations that will be addressed if any of them is used in the 
   final ALTO discovery protocol. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   This version of the draft presents a survey of possible discovery 
   mechanisms for ALTO service discovery. There is no formal 
   recommendation on the discovery mechanisms at this point. As such, 
   there is no IANA consideration on any forms of assignment. 

7. Conclusions 

   The document intends to start the discussion about ALTO discovery in 
   the ALTO WG. It discusses various scenarios of ALTO discovery, 
   provides a survey of available options, and addresses potential 
   issues and consideration for each.
