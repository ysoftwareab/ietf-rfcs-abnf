         Examples of the 'XML2RFC' Version 2 and 3 Vocabularies
                    draft-hoffman-rfcexamples-01

Abstract

   This document gives examples of use of the "XML2RFC" vocabulary.  The
   examples cover both version 2 and version 3.  The purposes of this
   draft it to give authors of Internet Drafts examples of how to use
   the XML vocabularies, and to show how use of the version 2 vocabulary
   will change with version 3.

1.  Introduction

   This document gives examples of use of the "XML2RFC" vocabulary.  The
   examples cover both version 2 [XML2RFCv2] and version 3 [XML2RFCv3].
   Some of the examples are given to help authors use parts of the
   vocabulary common to both versions (called "v2" and "v3" in this
   document), while others appear in order to help authors transitioning
   from version 2 to version 3 to see how features from the earlier
   version relate to features in the later version.

   This document currently only has one main example, which shows the
   commonly-used XML elements.  A future version of the document may
   have a more complete example, and will very likely have topic-
   specific examples (such as lists, tables, and so on).

2.  Example of a v2 Document

   The following is a v2 document that has all the elements that are
   needed for typical Internet Drafts.
