  Abstract 
   
  A handover is the process during which a mobile node is handed over 
  between access networks. Especially for vertical handovers in overlay 
  networks the mobile node changes the access network using multiple 
  interfaces including different link layers, e.g., WLAN, GPRS, and 
  UMTS. Handovers occur as a consequence of lower layer (i.e., link-
  layer) handovers that signify a switch of the physical connection to 
  a new location. For the duration of a handover, a mobile node is 
  unable to send or receive traffic. The length of this disruption is 
  considered critical because it affects the performance of the 
  communication. An additional factor is the link layer selection. It 
  implies the selection of the most suitable link layer from which a 
  mobile node should receive services. 
   
  With the help of DNA it is possible on one side to provide proactive 
  handover decision for mobility protocols (e.g., for MIPv6) and on the 
  other side to select the best link layer including multiple interface 
  support. This draft describes a method that allows seamless handovers

  and optimal link layer selection using a proactive handover decision 
  that is based on a policy. The policy considers L2 information and 
  DNA assumptions.

1. Introduction 
 
  In cellular and wireless networks, handover decision can benefit from 
  DNA information that is available for each link layer. Proactive 
  handover decision reduces the packet loss during handovers. This 
  draft describes a method that considers the aforementioned DNA 
  information that is indicative of the status of any underlying link 
  layer to determine when a handover should be forced. 
   
  Due to the wide range of wireless technologies such as WLAN, GPRS, 
  and UMTS, a mobile node will have multiple interfaces to include such 
  systems for seamless mobility support. However, seamless handovers 
  have to be forced defined by system or user requirements and mainly 
  based on the available bearer information, e.g., link layer 
  information. Link layer information can be derived by DNA and allow 
  the control of handover for seamless mobility support, e.g., for 
  Mobile IPv6. Especially for vertical handover in overlay networks, 
  e.g., handover between WLAN hot spots and cellular systems, a 
  handover decision based on DNA consideration is required. Hence, this 
  draft includes a problem analysis and describes a policy for handover 
  decisions for mobile terminals with different link layers.

4. Seamless Handovers in Wireless Networks û Problem Overview 
   
  Seamless handovers in heterogeneous wireless networks are mainly 
  based on movement detection that forces handovers from the previous 
  network to the new network. Movement detection in Mobile IPv6 uses 
  agent advertisements [2] that are used by mobile nodes to detect 
  whether an access network is reachable for data transmission or not.  
 
  The statements in [2] have to be considered to determine whether the 
  movement detection is appropriate for seamless handovers in 
  heterogeneous and overlay networks. The conclusion is that generic 
  movement detection is not suitable to support seamless handovers with 
  a reduction of packet loss during handovers. In [2] it is described 
  how often the router advertisements have to be broadcasted by access 
  routers to support movement detection in heterogeneous networks, so-
  called unsolicited router advertisements. 
 
  Movement detection which is described in [2] is based on Neighbor 
  Discovery/Neighbor Unreachability Detection [3] and on router 
  advertisements which are frequently broadcasted by the access 
  routers. Movement detection which is based on Neighbor Unreachability 
  Detection is not appropriate for seamless mobility due to the fact

  that the previous link breaks before the handover is performed. This 
  causes too long service disruptions, because the Neighbor 
  Unreachability Detection detects that the link cannot be used for 
  further communication only after the previous link breaks.  
   
  It has to be understood that all statements in [2] and [3] describe 
  movement detection and neighbor unreachability detection after the 
  previous link breaks. However, a decision how to trigger a Mobile 
  IPv6 handover between access networks or interfaces is not defined in 
  [2]. Handover decision that is defined in the following is based on 
  L2 information that is derived from DNA policies. The following 
  describes how the handover decision can be enhanced by using so-
  called proactive handovers in heterogeneous networks without major 
  changes to the mobility protocols.  
   
  In fig.1 a mobility scenario is described which is the basis for the 
  assumptions within this draft. Although there are only two different 
  access routers (AR) described in fig.1, the mobile node (MN) includes 
  different wireless interfaces for current and future wireless bearer 
  technologies. The mobile node is able to force horizontal handovers 
  within the same bearer technology and vertical handovers in overlay 
  networks.

5. Reactive/Proactive Handover Decision 
   
  There are two different handover decisions which have to be 
  considered for the design of seamless and lossless handovers, 
  reactive and proactive handover decision. The reactive handover 
  provides an active link connection to the previous access network 
  until the previous link breaks. Afterwards it establishes an active 
  link to the new access network.  
   
  For the proactive handover the mobile node has an active link 
  connection to the new access network before the link breaks and 
  maintains the previous link even when the handover from the previous 

   
  IPonAir             Expires August 25, 2005               [Page 4] 
   
  Internet-Draft            POLIMAND                   February 2005 
   
   
  access network to the new access network has been established. In 
  that case the handover can be established before the previous link 
  breaks. The proactive handover from one access network to another may 
  be forced due to DNA assumptions which are based on link layer 
  information about the link conditions. A list of link layer 
  parameters which are available in different bearer systems is given 
  in [5]. 
   
  In the following the reactive handover decision and the proactive 
  handover decision are described to show the advantages on the 
  proactive handover decision to reduce packet loss during Mobile IPv6 
  handovers. 
 
5.1 Reactive Handover Decision 
 
  In fig.2 the mobile node roams between (n) different access networks. 
  Link(n) is the connection to the router in network(n) and Link(n+1) 
  is the connection to the router in network(n+1). While Link(n) is 
  permanently reachable, Link(n+1) changes its link characteristics 
  (good/bad link layer conditions). When the previous link breaks due 
  to bad conditions, the mobile node starts the stateful/stateless IPv6 
  address autoconfiguration [4] to the new link. After successful 
  address configuration the new IPv6 address is used by the mobile node 
  for data transmission via the new link.  
   
  The handover duration between the previous link and the new link is 
  named as link disruption. Link disruption is the reason for packet 
  loss during handovers between the previous network and the new 
  network. It should be reduced to minimize packet loss during Mobile 
  IPv6 handovers.

  Figure 2: Handover from Link(n+1) to Link (n) based on a reactive 
  handover scenario. 
   
  In [6] a reactive handover design is described which is based on link 
  layer hints for L3 handovers after the previous link breaks. It 
  forces an IPv6 address autoconfiguration during the handover to the 
  new access router after the previous link is lost by the mobile node. 
 
5.2 Proactive Handover Decision 
 
  For the proactive handover decision the mobile node has a link 
  connection to a new network before the link of the previous network 
  breaks (simultaneous use of wireless interfaces). Hence, the 
  proactive handover decision differs from the reactive scenario that 
  has no link connection during the handover.

  In fig. 3 the characteristic of Link(n+1) changes and a hint is used 
  to establish a handover. The hint contains information (e.g., L2 
  information and DNA considerations) about the link characteristic and 
  is used to control L3 handovers.  
   
  The hint triggers an anticipated IPv6 (stateful/stateless) address 
  configuration [4]. When the new IPv6 address is available and is used 
  by the mobile node (Link(n+1)), the handover is established and the 
  new link is used for data transmission.

  Figure 3: Handover from Link(n+1) to Link(n) based on a proactive 
  handover scenario.  
 
   
  The proactive handover decision reduces link disruption to a minimum 
  because a new link will be established for ongoing data transmission 
  while the previous link is still in use. It reduces the packet loss 
  during handovers and supports anticipated handover scenarios.     
 
6. Link Layer Information 
   
  There are different bearer systems available which provide different 
  link layer information. Different bearer systems like IEEE 
  802.11a/b/g, hiperLAN2, GSM, GPRS and UMTS are currently available 
  and are used in IP networks. These bearer systems use various link 
  layers with different types of link layer information.  
   
  Different link layer information requires a generic platform which 
  combines link layer information from different link layer systems. 
  However, a list of different link layer parameters from various 
  network systems is required that simplifies the control of L3 
  handovers between different access networks. A detailed list of 
  different link layer parameters is given in [5]. 
   
7. Handover Policy 
   
  This draft proposes a so-called Handover Policy Decision Function. It 
  is a proactive and seamless handover decision method, which is the 
  basis for less or zero packet loss during vertical handovers in 
  heterogeneous overlay networks. This method forces L3 handovers 
  before the previous link breaks based on a policy. The policy based 
  handover has the advantage of using a more suitable link instead of 
  the previous link, which may not provide adequate link conditions or 
  may be stale. It minimizes packet loss and provides seamless and 
  reliable link connectivity of the mobile node during movements.

  The Handover Policy Decision Function uses L2 information to decide 
  if there is a handover required from the previous network to a new 
  network. Fig. 4 shows the control of L3 handovers based on link layer 
  information and considers DNA assumptions.

7.1 Handover Policy Decision Function 
   
  The Handover Policy Decision Function establishes L3 handovers from 
  the previous network to the new network when the link characteristic 
  is no longer adequate for data transmission. Hence, a policy is 
  required when the handover has to be forced. The policy should be 
  based on a combination of different link layer information to control 
  the handovers.  
 
7.2 Definition of the Handover Policy Decision Function 
   
  In the following the Handover Policy Decision Function is defined. It 
  is a generic definition that includes assumptions about available and 
  future wireless link layer technologies.  
   
  Generic handover policy function: 
   
  Handover(a1*Link Layer 1, a2*Link Layer 2, ..., an*Link Layer n) 
 
  The Handover Policy Decision Function considers different link layer 
  technologies. Each link layer contains a number of different L2 hints 
  (matrix h) that is listed in [5]. Due to system or user requirements 
  the L2 information is differently weighted (matrix a). 
 
  Handover policy definition: 
   
  Link Layer 1= a11*h11 + a12*h12 + ...+ a1n*h1n 
  Link Layer 2= a21*h21 + a22*h22 + ...+ a2n*h2n 
  ... 
  Link Layer n= am1*hm1 + am2*hm2 + ...+ amn*hmn 
 
  The handover decision is based on the policy definition and the link 
  layer characteristic. The characteristic of each link layer is 
  considered by the vector l. The policy of the handover definition is 
  used to select the target link layer from the available wireless 
  interfaces.   
 
  Handover policy:

  Target Link Layer = (l1*Link Layer 1 + l2*Link Layer 2 + , ..., + 
  ln*Link Layer n) 
   
  The target link layer is the new link layer at the mobile node. A 
  handover has to be forced from the previous link layer to the new 
  target link layer when the link layer characteristic has changed due 
  to policy considerations.  
 
7.3 Handover Policy Enhancements 
   
  The Handover Policy Decision Function should be enhanced to consider 
  the functionality of other mobility protocols, e.g., Hierarchical 
  Mobile IPv6 [7] and Fast Mobile IPv6 [8]. HMIPv6 and FMIPv6 may use 
  the Handover Policy Decision Function to reduce link disruption and 
  to minimize packet loss during vertical handovers in heterogeneous 
  overlay networks. 
   
8. Security Considerations 
   
  This document discusses considerations for handover decisions based 
  on DNA assumptions for multiple link layers. The associated security 
  issues will be discussed as future work.
