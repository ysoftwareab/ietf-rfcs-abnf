Abstract

   This memo describes how authPassword LDAP attribute can be used for
   storing secrets used by Salted Challenge Response (SCRAM) Simple
   Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) Mechanism.

Note

   A revised version of this draft document will be submitted to the RFC
   editor as a Proposed Standard for the Internet Community.  Discussion
   and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should be sent to

Internet-Draft    LDAP schema for storing SCRAM secrets    November 2008


1.  Overview

   This memo defines a family of schema for authPassword attribute
   defined in [AUTHPASS].  Non terminal references in the following ABNF
   are defined in either [AUTHPASS] or [RFC5234].

      The "scheme" part of the authPassword attribute is the SCRAM
      mechanism name, e.g.  "SCRAM-HMAC-SHA-1".  See [SCRAM] for the
      exact syntax of SCRAM mechanism names.

      The "authInfo" part of the authPassword attribute is the iteration
      count, followed by ":" and base-64 [BASE64] encoded salt.

      The "authValue" part of the authPassword attribute is the base-64
      [BASE64] encoded StoredKey [SCRAM], followed by ":" and base-64
      [BASE64] encoded ServerKey [SCRAM].

   Syntax of the attribute can be expressed using ABNF [RFC5234]:

       scram-mech     = "SCRAM-HMAC-SHA-1"
                        ;; Complies with ABNF for <scheme>

       scram-authInfo = iter-count ":" salt
                        ;; Complies with ABNF for <authInfo>

       scram-authValue = stored-key ":" server-key
                        ;; Complies with ABNF for <authValue>

       iter-count   = %x31-39 *DIGIT
                      ; a positive number without leading zeros

       salt         = <<base-64 encoded value>>

       stored-key   = <<base-64 encoded value>>

       server-key   = <<base-64 encoded value>>

   [[anchor2: Add an example.]]

   Note that the authPassword attribute is multivalued.  For example, it
   may contain multiple SCRAM hashes for different hashing algorithms.


2.  Security Considerations

   Servers MUST validate format of the saslSecretScram attribute before
   using it for performing a SCRAM authentication exchange.  It is
   possible that an attacker compromised the LDAP server or got access

   to the entry containing the attribute in order to exploit a
   vulnerability in the subsystem performing SCRAM authentication
   exchange.  Big iteration counts and invalid base-64 encoding are two
   possible (but not the only) exploits in the format specified in the
   document.

   [[anchor3: TBD.]]


3.  IANA Considerations

   No action is required from IANA.
