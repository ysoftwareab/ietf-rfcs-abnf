Internet-Draft        Multicast Address Allocation          October 2005


1.  Introduction

   Good, up-to-date documentation of IP multicast is close to non-
   existent.  Particularly, this is an issue with multicast address
   allocations (to networks and sites) and assignments (to hosts and
   applications).  This problem is stressed by the fact that there
   exists confusing or misleading documentation on the subject
   [RFC2908].  The consequence is that those who wish to learn of IP
   multicast and how the addressing works do not get a clear view of the
   current situation.

   The aim of this document is to provide a brief overview of multicast
   addressing and allocation techniques.  The term 'addressing
   architecture' refers to the set of addressing mechanisms and methods
   in an informal manner.

   It is important to note that Source-specific Multicast (SSM)
   [I-D.ietf-ssm-arch] does not have these addressing problems; hence,
   this document focuses on the Any Source Multicast (ASM) model.

   This memo obsoletes RFCs 2776, 2908, and 2909 and re-classifies them
   Historic.

1.1.  Terminology: Allocation or Assignment

   Almost all multicast documents and many other RFCs (such as DHCPv4
   [RFC2131] and DHCPv6 [RFC3315]) have used the terms address
   "allocation" and "assignment" interchangeably.  However, the operator
   and address management communities use these for two conceptually
   different processes.

   In unicast operations, address allocations refer to leasing a large
   block of addresses from Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to
   a Regional Internet Registry (RIR) or from RIR to a Local Internet
   Registry (LIR) possibly through a National Internet Registry (NIR).
   Address assignments, on the other hand, are the leases of smaller
   address blocks or even single addresses to the end-user sites or end-
   users themselves.

   Therefore, in this memo, we will separate the two different
   functions: "allocation" describes how larger blocks of addresses are
   obtained by the network operators, and "assignment" describes how
   applications, nodes or sets of nodes obtain a multicast address for
   their use.

Internet-Draft        Multicast Address Allocation          October 2005


2.  Multicast Address Allocation

   Multicast address allocation, i.e., how a network operator might be
   able to obtain a larger block of addresses, can be handled in a
   number of ways as described below.

   Note that these are all only pertinent to ASM -- SSM requires no
   address block allocation because the group address has only local
   significance (however, we discuss the address assignment inside the
   node in Section 3.2).

2.1.  Derived Allocation

   Derived allocations take the unicast prefix or some other properties
   of the network to determine unique multicast address allocations.

2.1.1.  GLOP Allocation

   GLOP address allocation [RFC3180] inserts the 16-bit public
   Autonomous System (AS) number in the middle of the IPv4 multicast
   prefix 233.0.0.0/8, so that each AS number can get a /24 worth of
   multicast addresses.  While this is sufficient for multicast testing
   or small scale use, it might not be sufficient in all cases for
   extensive multicast use.

   A minor operational debugging issue with GLOP addresses is that the
   connection between the AS and the prefix is not apparent from the
   prefix when the AS number is greater than 255, but has to be
   calculated (e.g., from [RFC3180], AS 5662 maps to 233.22.30.0/24).  A
   usage issue is that GLOP addresses are not tied to any prefix but to
   routing domains, so they cannot be used or calculated automatically.

2.1.2.  Unicast-prefix -based Allocation

   RFC 3306 [RFC3306] describes a mechanism which embeds up to 64 first
   bits of an IPv6 unicast address in the prefix part of the IPv6
   multicast address, leaving at least 32 bits of group-id space
   available after the prefix mapping.

   A similar mapping has been proposed for IPv4 [I-D.ietf-mboned-ipv4-
   uni-based-mcast], but it provides a rather low amount of addresses
   (e.g., 1 per an IPv4 /24 block).  While there exist large networks
   without an AS number of their own, this has not been seen to add
   sufficient value compared to GLOP addressing.

   The IPv6 unicast-prefix-based allocations are an extremely useful way
   to allow each network operator, even each subnet, obtain multicast
   addresses easily, through an easy computation.  Further, as the IPv6



Savola                   Expires April 21, 2006                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft        Multicast Address Allocation          October 2005


   multicast header also includes the scope value [RFC3513], multicast
   groups of smaller scope can also be used with the same mapping.

   The IPv6 Embedded RP technique [RFC3956], used with Protocol
   Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM), further leverages the
   unicast prefix based allocations, by embedding the unicast prefix and
   interface identifier of the PIM-SM Rendezvous Point (RP) in the
   prefix.  This provides all the necessary information needed to the
   routing systems to run the group in either inter- or intra-domain
   operation.  A difference to RFC 3306 is, however, that the hosts
   cannot calculate their "multicast prefix" automatically, as the
   prefix depends on the decisions of the operator setting up the RP but
   rather requires an assignment method.

   All the IPv6 unicast-prefix-based allocation techniques provide
   sufficient amount of multicast address space for the network
   operators.

2.2.  Scope-relative Allocation

   Administratively scoped multicast [RFC2365] is provided by two
   different means: under 239.0.0.0/8 in IPv4 or by 4-bit encoding in
   the IPv6 multicast address prefix [RFC3513].

   As IPv6 scope-relative allocations can be handled with unicast-
   prefix-based multicast addressing as described in Section 2.1.2, and
   there is no need for separate scope-relative allocations, we'll just
   discuss IPv4 in this section.

   The IPv4 scope-relative prefix 239.0.0.0/8 is further divided to
   Local Scope (239.255.0.0/16) and Organization Local Scope
   (239.192.0.0/14); other parts of the administrative scopes are either
   reserved for expansion or undefined [RFC2365].  However, RFC 2365 is
   ambiguous as to whether it's the enterprises or the IETF who are
   allowed to expand the space.

   Topologies which act under a single administration can easily use the
   scoped multicast addresses for their internal groups.  Groups which
   need to be shared between multiple routing domains (but not
   propagated through the Internet) are more problematic and typically
   need an assignment of a global multicast address because their scope
   is undefined.

   There is a large number of multicast applications (such as "Norton
   Ghost") which are restricted either to a link or a site, and it is
   extremely undesirable to propagate them further (either to the rest
   of the site, or beyond the site).  Typically many such applications
   have been given or have hijacked a static IANA address assignment;



Savola                   Expires April 21, 2006                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft        Multicast Address Allocation          October 2005


   this makes it challenging to implement proper propagation limiting --
   which could be easier if such applications could have been assigned
   specific scope-relative addresses instead.  This is an area of
   further future work.

   There has also been work on a protocol to automatically discover
   multicast scope zones [RFC2776], but it has never been widely
   implemented or deployed.

2.3.  Static IANA Allocation

   In some rare cases, some organizations may have been able to obtain
   static multicast address allocations (of up to 256 addresses)
   directly from IANA.  Typically these have been meant as a block of
   static assignments to multicast applications, as described in
   Section 3.4.  In principle, IANA does not allocate multicast address
   blocks to the operators but GLOP or Unicast-prefix-based allocations
   should be used instead.

2.4.  Dynamic Allocation

   RFC 2908 [RFC2908] proposed three different layers of multicast
   address allocation and assignment, where layers 3 (inter-domain
   allocation) and layer 2 (intra-domain allocation) could be applicable
   here.  Multicast Address-Set Claim Protocol (MASC) [RFC2909] is an
   example of the former, and Multicast Address Allocation Protocol
   (AAP) [I-D.ietf-malloc-aap] (abandoned in 2000 due lack of interest
   and technical problems) is an example of the latter.

   Both of the proposed allocation protocols were quite complex, and
   have never been deployed or seriously implemented.

   It can be concluded that there are no dynamic multicast address
   allocation protocols, and other methods such as GLOP or unicast-
   prefix-based addressing should be used instead.


3.  Multicast Address Assignment

   For multicast address assignment, i.e., how an application learns the
   address it can use, or a node (or a set of nodes) learns an address
   it could use for an application, has a number of options as described
   below.

   Any IPv6 address assignment method should be aware of the guidelines
   for the assignment of the group-IDs for IPv6 multicast addresses
   [RFC3307].

Internet-Draft        Multicast Address Allocation          October 2005


3.1.  Derived Assignment

   There are significantly fewer options for derived address assignment
   compared to derived allocation.  Derived multicast assignment has
   only been specified for IPv6 link-scoped multicast [I-D.ietf-ipv6-
   link-scoped-mcast], where the EUI64 is embedded in the multicast
   address, providing a node with unique multicast addresses for link-
   local ASM communications.

3.2.  SSM Assignment inside the Node

   While the SSM multicast addresses have only local (to the node)
   significance, there is still a minor issue on how to assign the
   addresses between the applications running on the same node (or more
   precisely, an IP address).

   This assignment is not considered to be a problem because typically
   the addresses for the applications are selected manually or
   statically, but if done using an Application Programming Interface
   (API), the API could check that the addresses do not conflict prior
   to assigning one.

3.3.  Manually Configured Assignment

   With manually configured assignment, the network operator who has a
   multicast address prefix assigns the multicast group addresses to the
   requesting nodes using a manual process.

   Typically the user or administrator which wants to use a multicast
   address for particular application requests an address from the
   network operator using phone, email, or similar means, and the
   network operator provides the user with a multicast address.  Then
   the user/administrator of the node or application manually configures
   the application to use the assigned multicast address.

   This is a relatively simple process; it has been sufficient for
   certain applications which require manual configuration in any case,
   or which cannot or do not want to justify a static IANA assignment.
   The manual assignment works when the number of participants in a
   group is small, as each participant has to be manually configured.

   This is the most commonly used technique when the multicast
   application does not have a static IANA assignment.

3.4.  Static IANA Assignment

   In contrast to manually configured assignment, as described above,
   static IANA assignment refers to getting a globally unique assignment



Savola                   Expires April 21, 2006                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        Multicast Address Allocation          October 2005


   for the particular application directly from IANA.  Guidelines for
   IANA are described in [RFC3171][I-D.ietf-mboned-rfc3171bis].

   This is seen as lucrative because it's the simplest approach for
   application developers because they can then hard-code the multicast
   address.  Hard-coding requires no lease of the usable multicast
   address, and likewise the client applications do not need to perform
   any kind of service discovery (but depending on hard-coded
   addresses).  However, there is an architectural scaling problem with
   this approach, as it encourages a "land-grab" of the limited
   multicast address space.

   [RFC3138] describes how to handle those GLOP assignments (called
   "eGLOP") which use the private-use AS number space (233.252.0.0/14).
   It was envisioned that IANA would delegate the responsibility of
   these to RIRs, which would assign or allocate addresses as best
   seemed fit.  However, this was never carried out as IANA did not make
   these allocations to RIRs due to procedural reasons.

   In summary, there are applications which have obtained a static IANA
   assignment and while some of which are really needed, some of which
   probably should not have been granted.  Conversely, there are some
   applications that have not obtained a static IANA assignment, yet
   should have requested an assignment and been granted one.

3.5.  Dynamic Assignments

   The layer 1 of RFC 2908 [RFC2908] described dynamic assignment from
   Multicast Address Allocation Servers (MAAS) to applications and
   nodes, with Multicast Address Dynamic Client Allocation Protocol
   (MADCAP) [RFC2730] as an example.  Since then, there has been a
   proposal for DHCPv6 assignment [I-D.jdurand-assign-addr-ipv6-
   multicast-dhcpv6].

   It would be rather straightforward to deploy a dynamic assignment
   protocol which would lease group addresses based on a multicast
   prefix to the applications wishing to use multicast.  For example,
   only few have implemented MADCAP, and it's not significantly
   deployed.  Moreover, it is not clear how widely for example the APIs
   for communication between the multicast application and the MADCAP
   client operating at the host have been implemented [RFC2771].

   An entirely different approach is Session Announcement Protocol (SAP)
   [RFC2974].  In addition to advertising global multicast sessions, the
   protocol also has associated ranges of addresses for both IPv4 and
   IPv6 which can be used by SAP-aware applications to create new groups
   and new group addresses.  Creating a session (and obtaining an
   address) is a rather tedious process which is why it isn't done all



Savola                   Expires April 21, 2006                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft        Multicast Address Allocation          October 2005


   that often.  (Note that the IPv6 SAP address is unroutable in the
   inter-domain multicast.)

   A conclusion about dynamic assignment protocols is that:

   1.  multicast is not significantly attractive in the first place,

   2.  very many applications have a static IANA assignment and thus
       require no dynamic or manual assignment,

   3.  those that cannot be easily satisfied with IANA or manual
       assignment (i.e., where dynamic assignment would be desirable)
       are rather marginal, or

   4.  that there are other gaps why dynamic assignments are not seen as
       a useful approach (for example, issues related to service
       discovery/rendezvous).

   In consequence, more work on rendezvous/service discovery would be
   needed to make dynamic assignments more useful.


4.  Summary and Future Directions

   This section summarizes the mechanisms and analysis discussed in this
   memo, and presents some potential future directions.

4.1.  Prefix Allocation

   Summary of prefix allocation methods for ASM is in Figure 1.

      +-------+--------------------------------+--------+--------+
      | Sect. | Prefix allocation method       | IPv4   | IPv6   |

      * = the need satisfied by IPv6 unicast-prefix-based allocation.

   Figure 1

   o  Only ASM is affected by the assignment/allocation issues (however,
      both ASM and SSM have roughly the same address discovery issues).

   o  GLOP allocations seem to provide a sufficient IPv4 multicast
      allocation mechanism for now, but could be extended in future.
      Scope-relative allocations provide the opportunity for internal
      IPv4 allocations.

   o  Unicast-prefix-based addresses and the derivatives provide good
      allocation strategy with IPv6, also for scoped multicast
      addresses.

   o  Dynamic allocations are a too complex and unnecessary mechanism.

   o  Static IANA allocations are generally an architecturally
      unacceptable approach.

4.2.  Address Assignment

   Summary of address assignment methods is in Figure 2.

      +-------+--------------------------------+----------+----------+
      | Sect. | Address assignment method      | IPv4     | IPv6     |
      +-------+--------------------------------+----------+----------+
      |  3.1  | Derived: link-scope addresses  |  No      |   Yes    |
      |  3.2  | SSM (inside the node)          |  Yes     |   Yes    |
      |  3.3  | Manual assignment              |  Yes     |   Yes    |
      |  3.4  | Static IANA/RIR assignment     |LastResort|LastResort|
      |  3.5  | Dynamic assignment protocols   |  Yes     |   Yes    |
      +-------+--------------------------------+----------+----------+

   Figure 2

   o  Manually configured assignment is what's typically done today, and
      works to a sufficient degree in smaller scale.

   o  Static IANA assignment has been done extensively in the past, but
      it needs to be tightened down to prevent problems caused by "land-
      grabbing".

   o  Dynamic assignment, e.g., MADCAP has been implemented, but there
      is no wide deployment, so a solution is there.  However, either
      there are other gaps in the multicast architecture or there is no
      sufficient demand for it in the first place when manual and static
      IANA assignments are available.  Assignments using SAP also exist
      but are not common; global SAP assignment is unfeasible with IPv6.

   o  Derived assignments are only applicable in a fringe case of link-
      scoped multicast.

Internet-Draft        Multicast Address Allocation          October 2005


4.3.  Future Actions

   o  Multicast address discovery/"rendezvous" needs to be analyzed at
      more length, and an adequate solution provided; the result also
      needs to be written down to be shown to the IANA static assignment
      requestors.  See [I-D.ietf-mboned-addrdisc-problems] for more.

   o  IPv6 multicast DAD and/or multicast prefix communication
      mechanisms should be analyzed (e.g.,
      [I-D.jdurand-ipv6-multicast-ra]): whether there is demand or not,
      and specify if yes.

   o  The IETF should consider whether to specify more ranges of the
      IPv4 scope-relative address space for static allocation for
      applications which should not be routed over the Internet (such as
      backup software, etc. -- so that these wouldn't need to use global
      addresses which should never leak in any case).

   o  The IETF should seriously consider its static IANA allocations
      policy, e.g., "locking it down" to a stricter policy (like "IETF
      Consensus") and looking at developing the discovery/rendezvous
      functions, if necessary.


5.  Acknowledgements

   Tutoring a couple multicast-related papers, the latest by Kaarle
   Ritvanen [RITVANEN] convinced the author that the up-to-date
   multicast address assignment/allocation documentation is necessary.

   Multicast address allocations/assignments were discussed at the
   MBONED WG session at IETF59 [MBONED-IETF59].

   Dave Thaler, James Lingard, and Beau Williamson provided useful
   feedback for the preliminary version of this memo.  Myung-Ki Shin,
   Jerome Durand, and John Kristoff also suggested improvements.

   assignment of multicast addresses are related to IANA functions, it
   wouldn't hurt if the IANA reviewed this entire memo.

   IANA considerations in sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 of [RFC2908] still
   apply to the administratively scoped prefixes.

   IANA may be interested in reviewing the accuracy of the statement on

   eGLOP address assignments in Section 3.4.

   (RFC-editor: please remove this section at publication.)


7.  Security Considerations

   This memo only describes different approaches to allocating and
   assigning multicast addresses, and this has no security
   considerations; the security analysis of the mentioned protocols is
   out of scope of this memo.

   Obviously, especially the dynamic assignment protocols are inherently
   vulnerable to resource exhaustion attacks, as discussed e.g., in
   [RFC2730].
