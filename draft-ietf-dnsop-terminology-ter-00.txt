              Terminology for DNS Transports and Location
                  draft-ietf-dnsop-terminology-ter-00

Abstract

   This document adds terms and abbreviations to "DNS Terminology" (RFC
   8499) that relate to DNS running over various transports, as well as
   terms and abbreviations for DNS resolution at traditional and non-
   traditional locations.

1.  New Terms and Abbreviations

   The following terms and abbreviations are added to Section 6 of
   [RFC8499].

   DNS-over-TLS (DoT):  DNS over TLS as defined in [RFC7858] and its
      successors.

   DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH):  DNS over HTTPS as defined in [RFC8484] and its
      successors.

   Classic DNS:  DNS over UDP or TCP as defined in [RFC1035] and its
      successors.  Classic DNS applies to DNS communication between stub
      resolvers and recursive resolvers, and between recursive resolvers
      and authoritative servers.'  Classic DNS is not encrypted.

   Recursive DoT (RDoT):  RDoT specifically means DNS-over-TLS for
      transport between a stub resolver and a recursive resolver, or
      between a recursive resolver and another recursive resolver.  This
      term is necessary because it is expected that DNS-over-TLS will
      later be defined as a transport between recursive resolvers and
      authoritative servers,

   Authoritative DoT (ADoT):  If DNS-over-TLS is later defined as the
      transport between recursive resolvers and authoritative servers,
      ADoT specifically means DNS-over-TLS for transport between
      recursive resolvers and authoritative servers.

Acknowledgments

   Sara Dickinson contributed ideas before the first draft was
   published.  Warren Kumari contributed the idea for "Applications
   Doing DNS" as a term.  Many people contributed the idea that it is
   better to define terms rather than just acronyms.
