Status of this Memo

   This document is an Internet-Draft and is subject to all provisions
   of Section 10 of RFC 2026.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.  Note that
   other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-
   Drafts.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
   time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet- Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

Abstract
   The IETF policies about rights in submissions to the IETF are
   designed to ensure that IETF contributions can be made available to
   the IETF and Internet communities while permitting the authors to
   retain as many rights in the document as possible. This memo details
   the IETF policies on rights in submissions to the IETF. It also
   describes the objectives that the policies are designed to meet.

                Copyright (C) The Internet Society. (2002)

1. Introduction
   Under the laws of most countries and current international treaties
   (for example the "Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and
   Artistic Work" [Berne]), authors obtain numerous rights in the works
   they produce automatically upon producing them.  These rights include
   copyrights, moral rights and other rights.  In many cases, if the
   author produces a work within the scope of his or her employment,
   most of those rights are usually  assigned (The Berne convention says



Bradner                                                         [Page 1]

Internet-Draft         IETF Rights in Submissions          February 2003


   some rights are "inalienable") to the employer, either by operation
   of law or, in many cases, under contract.

   In order for works to be used within the IETF process, certain
   limited rights in all contributions must be granted to the IETF and
   Internet Society (ISOC).  In addition, contributors must make
   representations to IETF and ISOC regarding their ability to grant
   these rights.  These necessary rights and representations have until
   now been laid out in Section 10 of [RFC 2026]. In the years since
   [RFC 2026] was published there have been a number of times when the
   exact intent of Section 10 has been the subject of vigorous debate
   within the IETF community.  The aim of this document is to clarify
   various ambiguities in Section 10 of [RFC 2026] that led to these
   debates and to amplify the policy in order to clarify what the IETF
   is currently doing.


   Sections 2 and 3 of this document address the rights in submissions
   to the IETF previously covered by Section 10 of [RFC 2026] and the
   "Note Well" explanatory text presented at many IETF activities.
   Section 4 gives definitions used in describing these policies.
   Section 5, 6 and 7 then explain the rationale for these provisions,
   including some of the clarifications that have become understood
   since the adoption of [RFC 2026].  The rules and procedures set out
   in this document are not intended to substantially modify or alter
   IETF's or ISOC's current policy toward contributions and submissions
   made to the IETF.

   A companion document [IETF IPR] will deal with rights in technologies
   developed or specified as part of the IETF process.  This document is
   not intended to address those issues.

   The rights addressed in this document fall into the following
   categories:

   o  rights to make use of contributed material
   o  copyrights in IETF documents
   o  rights to produce derivative works
   o  rights to use trademarks

   This document is not intended as legal advice.  If you would like a
   legal interpretation of your rights or the rights of the IETF in any
   contributions you make, you are advised to consult your own legal
   advisor.

2. Rights in IETF Submissions

2.1.  General Policy



Bradner                                                         [Page 2]

Internet-Draft         IETF Rights in Submissions          February 2003


   In all matters of copyright and document procedures, the intent is to
   benefit the Internet community and the public at large, while
   respecting the legitimate rights of others.

2.2  Confidentiality Obligations

   No contribution that is subject to any requirement of confidentiality
   or any restriction on its dissemination may be considered in any part
   of the Internet Standards Process, and there must be no assumption of
   any confidentiality obligation with respect to any such contribution.
   Each contributor hereby agrees that any statement in a contribution,
   whether generated automatically or otherwise, that states or implies
   that the contribution is confidential or subject to any privilege,
   can be disregarded for all purposes, and will be of no force or
   effect.

2.3.  Granting of Rights and Permissions

   By submission of a contribution, each person actually submitting the
   contribution is deemed to agree to the following terms and
   conditions, and to grant the following rights, on his or her own
   behalf, on behalf of the organization (if any) the contributor
   represents and on behalf of the owners of any proprietary rights in
   the contribution.

   a. To the extent that the contribution or any portion thereof is
      protected by copyright and other rights of authorship, the
      contributor, the organization he or she represents or is sponsored
      by (if any) and the owners of any such proprietary rights in the
      contribution, grant an perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive,
      royalty-free, world-wide right and license to the ISOC and the
      IETF under all intellectual property rights in the contribution:

      (A) to copy, publish, display and distribute the contribution as
         part of the IETF standards process,

      (B) unless explicitly disallowed in the written terms of the
         contribution [pursuant to one of the notices contained in
         Section 3.3 below], to prepare derivative works that are based
         on or incorporate all or part of the contribution within the
         IETF standards process, the license to such derivative works to
         be of a scope no wider than the license to the original
         contribution, and

      (C) to reproduce any trademarks, service marks or trade names
         which are included in the contribution solely in connection
         with the reproduction, distribution or publication of the
         contribution and derivative works thereof as permitted by this



Bradner                                                         [Page 3]

Internet-Draft         IETF Rights in Submissions          February 2003


         paragraph, and in all cases reproducing any trademark or
         service mark identifiers used by the contributor of the
         contribution.

   b. The contributor grants the IETF and ISOC permission to reference
      the name(s) and address(es) of the contributor(s) and of the
      organization(s) s/he represents or is sponsored by (if any).

   c.  Every copy of a IETF document made pursuant to the licenses
      granted under paragraph (a)(A) above, and all derivative works
      made pursuant to the licenses granted under paragraph (a)(B)
      above, must include, in unaltered form, the notices included in
      such contribution pursuant to Section 3 below.

2.4  Representations and Warranties.  With respect to each contribution,
   each contributor represents that to the best of his or her knowledge
   and ability:

   a. The contribution properly acknowledges all major contributors.  A
      major contributor is any person who has materially or
      substantially contributed to the contribution.

   b. No information in the contribution is confidential and the IETF,
      ISOC, and its affiliated organizations may freely disclose any
      information in the contribution.

   c. There are no limits to the contributor's ability to make the
      grants acknowledgments and agreements herein that are reasonably
      and personally known to the contributor.

   d.  The contributor has not intentionally included in the
      contribution any material which is defamatory or untrue or which
      is illegal under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the
      contributor has his or her principal place of business or
      residence.

   e.  All trademarks, trade names, service marks and other proprietary
      names used in the contribution and personally and reasonably known
      to the contributor are clearly designated as such where
      reasonable.

2.5 The contributor acknowledges that the ISOC and IETF have no duty to
   publish or otherwise use or disseminate any contribution.  The ISOC
   and the IETF reserve the right to withdraw or cease using any
   contribution that does not comply with the requirements of Sections
   2.3 and 2.4 above.

2.6  Contributors who claim trademark rights to terms in their



Bradner                                                         [Page 4]

Internet-Draft         IETF Rights in Submissions          February 2003


   contributions are requested to specifically state what conditions
   apply to implementers of the technology relative to the use of any
   claimed trademarks.  Such statements should be submitted in the same
   way as is done for other intellectual property claims. (see [IETF
   IPR] sec 6)


3.  Copyright notice required in IETF Documents

   The IETF requires that a copyright notice and disclaimer be
   reproduced verbatim in all IETF Documents.  This requirement protects
   IETF and its participants from liabilities connected with these
   documents.  The copyright notice also alerts readers that the
   document is an IETF document, and that ISOC claims copyright rights
   in certain aspects of the document, such as its layout, the RFC
   numbering convention and the prefatory language of the document.
   This legend is not intended to imply that ISOC has obtained ownership
   of the contribution itself, which is retained by the author(s) or
   remains in the public domain, as applicable.

   Additional copyright notices are not permitted in IETF documents
   except in the case where the document is the product of a joint
   development effort between the IETF and another standards development
   organization.  Such exceptions must be approved on an individual
   basis by the IAB.



3.1 Copyright notice and disclaimer

   One of the following two copyright notice and disclaimers shall be
   included at the end of all IETF documents.

3.1.1 Notice for documents where the right to produce derivative works
   has not been withheld. (See sec 5.3 for a discussion on derivative
   works.)


   "Copyright (C) The Internet Society (year). Except as set forth
   below, authors retain all their rights.

   This document and translations of it may be copied and furnished to
   others, and derivative works that comment on or otherwise explain it
   or assist in its implementation may be prepared, copied, published
   and distributed, in whole or in part, without restriction of any
   kind, provided that the above copyright notice and this paragraph are
   included on all such copies and derivative works.  However, this
   document itself may not be modified in any way, such as by removing

   the copyright notice or references to the Internet Society or other
   Internet organizations, except as needed for the  purpose of
   developing Internet standards in which case the procedures for rights
   in submissions defined in the IETF Standards Process must be
   followed, or as required to translate it into languages other than
   English.

   The limited permissions granted above are perpetual and will not be
   revoked by the Internet Society or its successors or assigns.

   This document and the information contained herein is provided on an
   "AS IS" basis and THE CONTRIBUTOR, THE ORGANIZATION HE/S HE
   REPRESENTS OR IS SPONSORED BY (IF ANY), THE INTERNET SOCIETY AND THE
   INTERNET ENGINEERING TASK FORCE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR
   IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTY THAT THE USE OF
   THE INFORMATION HEREIN WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY RIGHTS OR ANY IMPLIED
   WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE."

3.1.2 Notice for documents where the right to produce derivative works
   has been withheld. (See sec 5.3 for a discussion on derivative
   works.)

   "Copyright (C) The Internet Society (year). Except as set forth
   below, authors retain all their rights.

   This document and translations of it may be copied and furnished to
   others provided that the above copyright notice and this paragraph
   are included on all such copies. However, this document itself may
   not be modified in any way, such as by removing the copyright notice
   or references to the Internet Society or other Internet
   organizations, except as required to translate it into languages
   other than English.

   The limited permissions granted above are perpetual and will not be
   revoked by the Internet Society or its successors or assigns.

   This document and the information contained herein is provided on an
   "AS IS" basis and THE CONTRIBUTOR, THE ORGANIZATION HE/S HE

   THE INFORMATION HEREIN WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY RIGHTS OR ANY IMPLIED
   WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE."


3.2 Notices re. Derivative Works and publication rights.

   In addition to the foregoing, each IETF Internet Draft must contain



Bradner                                                         [Page 6]

Internet-Draft         IETF Rights in Submissions          February 2003


   one of the following three notices regarding derivative works and
   publication rights on it's first page: (See sec 5.3 for a discussion
   on derivative works.)

   a. This document is an Internet-Draft and is subject to all
      provisions of section 2 of RFC XXXX.

   b. This document is an Internet-Draft and is subject to all
      provisions of Section 2 of RFC XXXX except that the right to
      prepare revised versions of this specification is not granted.

   c. This document is an Internet-Draft and is subject to all
      provisions of Section 2 RFC XXXX, but the author does not provide
      the IETF with any rights other than to publish as an Internet-
      Draft

   [ note to the RFC Editor - XXXX above to be replaced with the number
   of this document ]

   The first statement is required for all documents that might be
   submitted for Standards Track publication. The primary motivation is
   the IETF retains change control, thus permitting augmenting the
   original document to clarify or enhance the protocol defined by the
   document.

   The second statement is used when "republishing" standards produced
   by other (non-IETF) standards organizations, industry consortia or
   individual companies. These are typically published as Informational
   RFCs, and does not require change control being ceded to the IETF.
   Basically, these documents convey information for the Internet
   community.

   The third statement is used when the documents purpose is to provide
   background information to educate and to facilitate discussions
   within IETF groups and the document is not intended to be published
   as an RFC.


4. Definitions

4.1 contribution: in the context of this memo, a contribution to the
   IETF is any submission intended by the contributor for publication as
   an Internet Draft or RFC and any statements made within the context
   of an IETF process. Such statements include verbal statements in IETF
   meetings, as well as written and electronic communications made at
   any time or place, which are addressed to
   o  the IETF plenary session,
   o  any IETF working group or portion thereof,



Bradner                                                         [Page 7]

Internet-Draft         IETF Rights in Submissions          February 2003


   o  the IESG, or any member thereof on behalf of the IESG,
   o  the IAB or any member thereof on behalf of the IAB,
   o  any IETF mailing list, including the IETF list itself, any working
      group or design team list, or any other list functioning under
      IETF auspices,
   o  the RFC Editor or the Internet-Drafts function

   Statements made outside of an IETF meeting, mailing list or other
   function, that are clearly not intended to be input to an IETF
   activity, group or function, are not contributions in the context of
   this memo.

4.2 IETF Standards Process: the activities undertaken by the IETF in any
   of the settings described in 4.1 above.

4.3 contributors: individuals making contributions

4.4 IETF documents:  RFCs and Internet Drafts.

4.5 RFC: the basic publication series for the IETF.  RFCs are published
   by the RFC Editor and once published are never modified.  (See [RFC
   2026] sec 2.1)

4.6 Internet Draft: temporary documents used in the IETF process.
   Internet Drafts are published by the IETF Secretariat and have a
   nominal maximum lifetime in the Secretariat's public directory of 6
   months after which they are removed.  Since Internet Drafts are
   archived many places on the Internet there is no effective limit on
   their actual lifetime. Internet Drafts that are under active
   consideration by the IESG are not removed from the Secretariat's
   public directory until that consideration is complete, in addition,
   the author of an Internet Draft can request that the lifetime in the
   Secretariat's public directory be extended before the expiration.
   (See [RFC 2026] sections 2.2 and 8)

4.7  IETF:  In the context of this document, the IETF includes all
   individuals who participate in meetings, working groups, mailing
   lists, functions and other activities which are organized or
   initiated by ISOC, the IESG or the IAB under the general designation
   of the Internet Engineering Task Force or IETF, but solely to the
   extent of such participation.

4.8  "reasonably and personally known": is used in section two above.
   It should be read to refer to something the individual knows
   personally or, because of the job the individual holds, would
   reasonably be expected to know.  This wording is used to indicate
   that an organization cannot purposely keep an individual in the dark
   about patents or patent applications just to avoid the notification



Bradner                                                         [Page 8]

Internet-Draft         IETF Rights in Submissions          February 2003


   requirement.  But this requirement should not be interpreted as
   requiring an organization to perform a patent or other IPR search
   every time one of its employees submits an Internet Draft or reads an
   Internet Draft submitted by someone else.


5. Exposition of why these procedures are the way they are

5.1 Rights Granted in Contributions

   The IETF/ISOC must obtain the right to publish a contribution as an
   RFC or an Internet Draft from the contributors.

   A primary objective of this policy is to obtain from the document
   authors only the non-exclusive rights that are needed to develop and
   publish IETF documents and to use the contributions in the IETF
   standards process while leaving all other rights with the authors.

   The non-exclusive rights that the IETF needs are:

   a. the right to publish the document
   b. the right to let the document be freely reproduced in the formats
      that the IETF publishes it in
   c. the right to let 3rd parties translate it into languages other
      than English
   d. except where explicitly excluded (see sec 3.2), the right to make
      derivative works within the IETF process.

   The authors retain all other rights, but cannot withdraw the above
   rights from the IETF/ISOC.

5.2 Rights to use Contributed Material

   Because, under the laws of most countries and applicable
   international treaties, copyright rights come into existence whenever
   a work of authorship is created (but see Section 6 below regarding
   public domain documents), and IETF cannot make use of contributions
   if it does not have sufficient rights with respect to these copyright
   rights, it is important that the IETF receive assurances from all
   contributors that they have the authority to grant the IETF the
   rights that they claim to grant.  Without this assurance, IETF and
   its participants would run a greater risk of liability to the owners
   of these rights.

   To this end, IETF asks contributors to give the assurances in Section
   2.4 above.  These assurances are requested, however, only to the
   extent of the contributor's reasonable and personal knowledge. (See
   sec 4.8)



Bradner                                                         [Page 9]

Internet-Draft         IETF Rights in Submissions          February 2003


5.3 Right to produce derivative works

   The IETF needs to be able to evolve its documents in response to
   experience gained in the deployment of the technologies described in
   the documents, to incorporate developments in research and to react
   to changing conditions on the Internet and other IP networks.  In
   order to do this the IETF must be able to produce derivatives of its
   documents; thus the IETF must obtain the right from contributors to
   produce derivative works. Note though that the IETF only requires
   this right for the production of derivative works within the IETF
   standards process.  The IETF does not need, nor does it obtain, the
   right to let derivative works be created outside of the IETF process.

   The right to produce derivative works is required for all IETF
   standards track documents and for most non-standards track documents.
   There are two exceptions to this requirement:  documents describing
   proprietary technologies and documents that are republications of the
   work of other standards organizations.

   The right to produce derivative works must be granted (i.e., an
   Internet Draft must be published with boilerplate "a" from sec 3.2)
   before an IETF working group can accept a document as a working group
   document or otherwise work on it.  Note: a working group can discuss
   any Internet Draft with the aim to decide if it should become a
   working group document, whether or not the right to produce
   derivative works has been yet granted.  For independent submissions,
   the right to produce derivative works must be granted for all
   standards track documents before the IESG will issue an IETF Last-
   Call and, for most non-standards track documents, before the IESG
   will consider the Internet Draft for publication.

   The IETF has historically encouraged organizations to publish details
   of their technologies, even where the technologies are proprietary
   ones, because understanding how existing technology is being used
   helps when developing new technology.  But organizations that publish
   information about proprietary technologies are frequently not willing
   to have the IETF produce revisions of the technologies and then claim
   that the IETF version is the "new version" of the organization's
   technology. Organizations which feel this way can specify that the
   document can be published following the other provisions of this
   section but withhold the right to produce derivative works.

   In addition, IETF documents frequently make normative references to
   standards or recommendations developed by other standards
   organizations.  Since the publications of some standards
   organizations are not public documents it can be quite helpful to the
   IETF to republish, with the permission of the other standards
   organization, some of these documents as IETF documents so that the



Bradner                                                        [Page 10]

Internet-Draft         IETF Rights in Submissions          February 2003


   IETF community can have open access to them to better understand what
   they are referring to.  In these cases the IETF documents can be
   published without the right for the IETF to produce derivative works.

   In both of the above cases in which the production of derivative
   works is excluded, the contributor must include a special legend in
   the contribution, as specified in section 3.2, in order to notify
   IETF participants about this restriction.

5.4  Rights to use trademarks

   Contributors may wish to seek trademark or service mark protection on
   any terms that are coined or used in their contributions.  IETF makes
   no judgment about the validity of any such trademark rights.
   However, the IETF requires each contributor, under the licenses
   described in Section 2.3.a above, to grant IETF a perpetual license
   to use any such trademarks or service marks solely in exercising its
   rights to reproduce, publish and modify the contribution.  This
   license does not authorize any IETF participant to use any trademark
   or service mark in connection with any product or service offering,
   but only in the context of IETF documents and discussions.



5.5  Who does this apply to?

   Rights and licenses granted to the IETF are granted to all
   individuals noted in section 4.7, irrespective of their employment or
   institutional affiliation.  However, these licenses do not extend
   broadly to the employers, sponsors or institutions of such
   individuals, nor do they authorize the individuals to exercise any
   rights outside the specific context of the IETF standards process.


6. Contributions Not Subject to Copyright

   Certain documents, including those produced by the U.S. government
   and those which are in the public domain, may not be protected by the
   same copyright and other legal rights as other documents.
   Nevertheless, we ask each contributor to grant to the IETF the same
   rights as he or she would grant, and to make the same
   representations, as though the contribution were a proprietary
   document.  We ask for these grants and representations only to the
   extent that the contribution may be protected. We believe they are
   necessary to protect the IETF, the standards process and all IETF
   participants, and also because the IETF does not have the resources
   or wherewithal to make any independent investigation as to the actual
   proprietary status of any document submitted to it.

7. Inclusion of legal notice

   Section three above defines a copyright notice to be included on IETF
   documents and in derivative works.  The full copyright notice does
   not need to be included in some specific types of derivative works.

   a/ in MIBs, PIBs and similar material commonly extracted from IETF
      documents, the following copyright notice should be included in
      the body of the material that will be extracted "Copyright (C)
      <year> The Internet Society. This version of this MIB module is
      part of RFC xxxx; see the RFC itself for the full legal notices."
      (Substitute "PIB" for "MIB" in the statement for PIBs.)  In the
      case of MIBs and PIBs this statement should be placed in the
      DESCRIPTION clause of the MODULE-IDENTITY macro.

      systems, for example, the DESCRIPTION clauses for MIB variables,
      do not need to include a copyright notice.


8  Security Considerations

   This memo relates to IETF process, not any particular technology.
   There are security considerations when adopting any technology,
   whether IPR- protected or not.  A working group should take those
   security considerations into account as one part of evaluating the
   technology, just as IPR is one part, but they are not issues of
   security with IPR procedures.
