ACR = current Available Cell Rate(current cell transmission rate).
ER  = maximum network allowed cell transmission rate from
          receiving RM cell, it's the ceiling of ACR.
CI  = Congestion indication in network from receiving RM cell.
LD_ACR  = ACR when a packet was last dropped, or when ACR is
             increased.  LD_ACR is always greater than or equal to ACR.
QL  = Queue Length, number of packets in VC queue
LT  = Low Queue Threshold

MQS  = Maximum Queue Size
P_CTR = Stores the value of the number of packets in the VC queue
            when a packet is dropped and is then decrement for every
            packet that is removed from the VC queue.
f   = Factor that determines the significance in rate reduction,
          with 0<f<1

LD_ACR = ACR;
LD_ACR = ACR;
P_CTR = QL;
LD_ACR = ACR ;

P_CTR = Max (P_CTR, 0);
