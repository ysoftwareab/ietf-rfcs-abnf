   1. Introduction 

	  This memo defines a registry of the IPPM working group metrics. It 
	  provides an OBJECT IDENTIFIER to each metric currently standardized 
	  by the IPPM WG. It defines the rules for the identification of the 
	  metrics standardized in the future.  

   2. The IPPM Framework 

	  The IPPM Framework consists in four major components: 

		   + A general framework for defining performance metrics, 
		   described  in the Framework for IP Performance Metrics, RFC 
		   2330; 

		   + A set of standardized metrics, which conform to this 
		   framework. The IPPM Metrics for Measuring Connectivity, RFC 2678 
		   [2]. The One-way Delay Metric for IPPM, RFC 2679 [3]. The One-
		   way Packet Loss Metric for IPPM, RFC 2680 [4]. The Round-trip 
		   Delay Metric for IPPM, RFC 2681 [5]; 

		   + Emerging metrics which are being specified in respect of this 
		   framework; 

		   + The IPPM-REPORTING-MIB for reporting the results of the 
		   measures and for interfacing heterogeneous measurement systems 
		   with management entities. 


   3. Overview 

	  This memo defines a registry of the current metrics and a framework 
	  for the integration of the future metrics for the following reasons: 

		   + to permit metrics to be clearly referenced by MIBs or other 
		   data models; 

		   + Metrics identifiers are needed to allow measurement 
		   interoperability; 

		   + Specification of new metrics is a continuous process, special 
		   care must be taken for the integration of the future 
		   standardized metrics. 

   4. IPPM metrics Registry framework 

	  MIBs need OBJECT INDENTIFIER to refer precisely to the standardized 
	  metrics. The registry associates an OBJECT IDENTIFIER to each metric.

	  As an example oneWayDelay and oneWayDelayPoissonStream have different 
	  identifiers. 

	  The registry has 2 root branches. The category of the document 
	  determines the node the branch the metric is identified in: 

		 + Metrics defined in a RFC are identified in the 'rfc' tree; 
		 + Metrics defined elsewhere may be identified in the 'other' tree. 

	  The name of the metric has to respect ASN.1 constraints. The name has 
	  to start with a lower case. The letter - is forbidden (more or less) 
	  in the name. In a way to preserve the readability of the metric name 
	  the letters following a - are forced to upper case. 

	  Sometime the name of the metric starts with 'Type-P'. It depends on 
	  the document not the semantic of the metric. In the registry it is 
	  removed from the name of the metric to reduce the length of the name 
	  and to uniforms the metrics names. 

	  Each metrics specification will include a section describing its 
	  metrics identifiers.  


   4.1. Metrics registry template 

	  Each memo includes a registry where are identified the metrics. The 
	  name of the section where is defined the registry terminate by 
	  'metrics registry'. The registry is defined using a MODULE-IDENTITY 
	  macro. Each metric is identify in the registry using a OBJECT-
	  IDENTITY macro. The identification defines the metric name, status, 
	  reference and OBJECT IDENTIFIER. 


	  IPPM-XXX-METRICS-REGISTRY DEFINITIONS ::= BEGIN

		   " This memo defines a registry for XXX metrics."

	  END   





   4.2. Initial IPPM metrics registry 


	  Metrics specified in a RFC of the WG IPPM are registered in the node 
	  rfc(1). They are numbered using the RFC order and the metrics 
	  definitions order in each memo. The value assigned to a metric is 
	  definitive and cannot be reused. 

	  These rules are applied to create the first IPPM the registry. The 
	  metrics already standardized are registered in the section named 
	  'IPPM metrics registry' of this memo.  


   4.3. IPPM registry management 

	  Usually, metrics are implemented during the specification process. At 
	  this step, a metric is not identified as an IPPM metric. There is a 
	  need to provide temporary metric identifiers to facilitate software 
	  integration and to permit interoperability measurement among 
	  different implementations. Otherwise the interoperability will be 
	  extremely limited du to the fact that implementers will choose 
	  arbitrary values to identify the new metrics. 

	  When the draft is considered mature, that is when all the metrics are 
	  defined and when they names are chosen: 

		  The authors will insert a registry in the section 'Standard 
		  metrics registry' of their document. A registry template is 
		  proposed above. 

		  The chairs of the IPPM WG provide metrics identifiers from the 
		  rfc(1) node of the registry.  

   4.4. Identification of metric from other organization 

	  Metrics defined by other organization may be registered in the node 
	  other(2).
