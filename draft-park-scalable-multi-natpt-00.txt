Abstract
    
  This document provides scalability extension to NAT-PT. The extension 
  is based on the use of DNS-ALG and exchange of load metrics amongst a
  cluster of NAT-PT devices. We refer such a NAT-PT device as mNAT-PT. 
  mNAT-PT is valuable in connecting large V6 domains to legacy V4 
  domain.

1.  Introduction
    
  In order to widely deploy IPv6 network, V4/V6 transition mechanisms 
  are essential. NAT-PT and TRT transition solutions are proposed for
  enable connectivity between IPv6-only and IPv4 networks. However,
  both these solutions have limitations for large size V6 networks. 
  This draft focuses on scaling extensions for traditional NAT-PT. 
  Specifically, a method to permit outbound sessions for IPv6
  hosts in a large IPv6-only domain to the legacy IPv4 domain using
  multiple mNAT-PT translators.
 
      
2.  Scaling Considerations
    
  The NAT-PT solution defined in [NATPT] does not address scalability 
  issue. Although TRT [TRT] considered scaling, it mandates 
  reconfiguration of existing systems such as host and DNS-server by
  the network administrator. This may not be feasible or desirable in 
  many circumstances, especially when the V6 domain is constituted 
  of mobile nodes. In this document, we propose mNAT-PT as an 
  efficient scalable solution to address such environments. Unlike
  TRT, mNAT-PT will not mandate changes to existing end-nodes.

3.  Terminology
    
  The following terminology is used throughout the document.  	
  	
  	o  NAT-PT device    	A device that implements traditional 
                            	NAT-PT function as described in [NATPT]. 
  
  	o  mNAT-PT function	Stands for "Multiple NAT-PT". mNAT-PT
                            	function makes use of NAT-PT, DNS-ALG
                            	and real-time load monitoring functions
                            	to scale NAT-PT function to multiple
                            	NAT-PT devices.

  	o  mNAT-PT device   	A device that implements mNAT-PT function.

    	o  Address Pool	 	IPv4 addresses to translate between IPv6 
    				and IPv4 realms.
  				  
  	o  Mapping Table    	Mapping between IPv4 and IPv6 addresses 
                            	in the NAT-PT (or) mNAT-PT device.
	
	o  Load threshold	This is an upper ceiling of NAT BINDings 
                            	configured for a given mNAT-PT device. 
                            	When a mNAT-PT device reaches the 
                            	threshold, the mNAT-PT device attempts to
                            	assign a different mNAT-PT device for new 
                            	sessions crossing the realms.

        o  ALG            	Application layer gateway.

        o  DNS-ALG        	DNS Application layer gateway, as

  As described in figure 1 above, IPv6-only hosts in the IPv6 domain
  are translated into IPv4 address by the NAT-PT device. NAT-PT is 
  listed as the default router in IPv6 network. Also, there may be a
  DNSv6 Server within the IPv6 domain. The above solution cannot 
  scale to support large no. of V6 hosts. 
  

5. V4/v6 topology with multiple mNAT-PT devices

  With growing deployment of IPv6-only networks, a single NAT-PT 
  will not be able to scale. Support for large number of mobile
  users is a requirement in a 3GPP mobile network. We propose
  deploying multiple mNAT-PT devices on the border of the IPv6
  domain as described below in figure 2. Each mNAT-PT device
  will perform NAT-PT function, host one or more unique IPv6
  prefixes and advertise the prefixes within the IPv6 domain.

  		Figure 3 : mNAT-PT functional framework


  A cluster of mNAT-PT devices may be configured to provide a scalable
  mNAT-PT solution to large V6 networks. All member nodes within a 
  mNAT-PT cluster carry the same Cluster Identifier (ClusterId). The
  Load-Monitor entity within each mNAT-PT is responsible for relaying
  the real-time load on the hosting mNAT-PT periodically and in turn, 
  collecting the load from member nodes within the cluster. The 
  Load-monitor supplies real-time up-uo-date load data of member 
  nodes to the DNS-ALG.

  The NAT-PT entity is required to invoke DNS-ALG for all DNS queries
  and responses traversing the domains. While processing the DNS
  response, the DNS-ALG will use load on member nodes as the basis to
  assign a IPv6 prefix in the AAAA response to the V6-node that 
  originated the DNS query. The IPv6 prefix assignment will be based
  on the load on the mNAT-PT node associated with the prefix. 


6.1. Load-monitor and Communication amongst mNAT-PT cluster members

  The following assumptions are made throughout the document. A few
  of these assumptions may be changed to suit specific deployment
  scenarios.

      * Communication amongst the cluster members may take place
        within the IPv6 domain.



Park, et, al.               Expires November 2003               [page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT            Scalable mNAT-PT Solution             May 2003


      * It is assumed that each of the mNAT-PT member nodes have
        non-conflicting address maps and host a IP-v6 prefix that 
        is also non-conflicting. 

      * This document uses NAT-BINDing load on member nodes as the
        criteria for determining which of the mNAT-PT devices is
        assigned to carry out a NAT-PT translation. However, load
        need not be the criteria or the only criteria to make the
        device selection. There may be other criteria or policies 
        that decide the right mNAT-PT device.

      * The document assumes that all mNAT-PT devices equal access 
        to all V4 routes in the V4 domain. This need not be the
        case. In such a case, the mNAT-PT devices must either 
        setup V4-over-V6 VPNs between themselves so this is 
        ensured (or) exchange the V4 route reachability between 
        themselves so the right prefix is assigned based on route
        reachability. The former is the preffered and recommended
        choice.

      * The document assumes that the Cluster-ID, 
        Cluster-controller and member nodes within a cluster are
        preconfigured on the mNAT-PT device. Dynamic discovery of
        Cluster members is out of the scope of this document.
        Election of initial or subsequent cluster controller is 
        also outside the scope of this document. Cluster 
        controller is assumed to be the first node of the cluster
        to come up. A cluster controller is required to be alive
        throughout the duration of the cluster.

      * The document assumes there exists a V6 path for any of
        the V6-only hosts to reach any of the mNAT-PT devices.

      * Lastly, [NIQ] does not seem like the right choice for 
        cluster communication. Cluster communication requires 
        reliable point-to-point data communication (say, TCP
        based sessions to a well-knwon port) and reliable
        point-to-multipoint communication. The document does
        not address the transport or message formats used for
        cluster communication at this time.

      * The communication amongst mNAT-PT cluster memebers
        devices should be properly authenticated to avoid any
        malicious devices trying to add a IPv6 prefix in the
        active list and thereby causing the traffic to be 
        directed to the malicious device.

    An mNAT-PT node joins the cluster by sending a message with
    the following mNAT-PT configuration data to Cluster controller. 
    The cluster controller, in turn, accepts the node into cluster
    by sending the existing cluster membership info, Load-data
    polling duration and mNAT-PT configuration for each of the
    member nodes. The periodic load-data update will also be used
    to validate the liveness of a memeber node. Alternately, 
    member nodes may terminate their memebership by explicitly
    sendign a termination message to the cluster controller.
 
		- The Cluster ID
		- Hosted IP-V6 Prefix
		- NAT-PT address map configuration 
 		- BINDings threshold limit

  Further to joining the cluster, the mNAT-PT nodes report their
  load-data to the cluster controller periodically. The load-data is
  essentially the count of active NAT-PT BINDings at the time of 
  reporting.
  

6.2. Redirection using DNS-ALG

  Each mNAT-PT must be configured with a threshold of NAT BINDings
  and one or more IP-v6 prefixes (as desccribed in the previous 
  section) in advance. The DNS-ALG is supplied with this information
  from the Load-Monitor.
    
  Typically, all the communications between a IPv4 device and IPv6 
  device starts with a DNS request. DNS-ALG receives the DNS request and
  converts the A query to a AAAA query and vice versa. When the DNS-ALG 
  receives the reply then it will decide which IPv6 prefix to use to 
  translate the IPv4 address. If the load on the hosting mNAT-PT is 
  within threshold configured for the node, then the prefix assigned 
  to the host mNAT-PT is included in the DNS response. Otherwise, 
  DNS-ALG will select a member node with the least percentage of load
  utilization vis-a-vis the threshold setting. 
  

7.  Security Considerations
  
  Cluster communication between cooperatign mNAT-PT devices must be
  authenticated so that sessions are not hijacked by a rogue node 
  that pretends to be a member mNAT-PT device.
