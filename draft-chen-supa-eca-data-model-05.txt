Abstract 

   This document describes a YANG data model for SUPA (Simplified Use 
   of Policy Abstractions) ECA (Event-Condition-Action) policies 
   using policy abstractions defined in [I-D. strassner-supa-generic-
   policy-info-model]. The EPDM (ECA policy data model) is refined 
   from SGPIM (SUPA Generic Policy Information Model)and EPRIM (ECA 
   Policy Rule Information Model) to be applied to deliver various 
   management policies for controlling managed entities throughout 
   the service development and deployment lifecycle. The generic ECA 
   policy data model could be augmented by additional YANG data 
   modules modeling and configuring policy-related protocols and 
   functions. Reusability as the major advantage of this approach can 
   be realized. The policy data model described in this document 
   provides common building blocks for such extensions.

1. Introduction 

   As defined in [I-D. strassner-supa-generic-policy-info-model], 
   policies either be used in a stand-alone policy rule or aggregated 
   into policy composite to perform more elaborate functions. The 
   SUPA policy is tree-structured and can be embedded into hierarchal 
   model.    

   In SUPA framework, the EPRIM is a set of subclasses that 
   specialize the concepts defined in the SGPIM for representing the 
   components of a Policy that uses ECA semantics. Note that, the 
   information model is independent of data repository, data 
   definition language, query language, implementation language, and 
   protocol. While the ECA policy has to be defined with data 
   repository, data definition language, query language, 
   implementation language, and protocol.  

   In this way, an ECA policy data model defines: 

   -An event or a set of events that trigger the evaluation of policy: 
   This is the trigger for the service management application to 
   evaluate if a policy needs to be applied. For example a user 
   action to provision a new VPN service can be an event. 

   -A set of conditions that need to be satisfied for the policy to 
   be applicable: This enables service management to select the right 
   policy by validating the conditions against the current network 
   state.  

   -A set of actions that should be triggered as part of the policy 
   execution: This enables the service management to provision the 
   service. 

   This document introduces YANG [RFC6020] [RFC6021] data models for 
   SUPA configuration. Such models can facilitate the standardization 
   for the interface of SUPA, as they are compatible to a variety of 
   protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] and [RESTCONF]. Please note 
   that in the context of SUPA, the term "application" refers to an

   operational and management applications employed, and possibly 
   implemented, by an operator.  

   With respect to the scope, defining an information model for the 
   policy exchange between the policy manager and policy agent and a 
   corresponding data model based on yang to support specific DDC 
   service use case is initial goal. The protocol specific aspects 
   are deferred to respective implementations. Also certain 
   foundational concepts of the model are intentionally left open to 
   enable future extension.

3. SUPA Policy Modules Top Level Design 

   In this section, a generic ECA policy data model is defined with 
   SGPIM to specify the top level sub-class. The SUPA policy is 
   constructed hierarchically with possible extension at each leaf 
   node. According to SGPIM framework, a supa-policy MUST have at 
   least one supa-policy-statement that is used to define the content 
   of the policy.  

   As shown in figure 2, the top level design policy data model is: 

   -supa-policy:          The root of the SUPA generic ECA policy 
   data model 

   -supa-policy-target:    The managed object that a supa-policy 
   monitors and/or controls the state of. The target will the where 
   the policy will be worked on, including domain, subnet and so on. 
   Also the managed object will be specified such as a VPN, flow, 
   link and so on. This class is specified by the user as the scope 
   and the object needs to be told.  

   -supa-policy-atomic:    A Policy that can be used in a stand-alone 
   manner, and hierarchic policy and composite policy has not been 
   taken into account in this document. Here the atomic means there 
   is only one ECA policy rule in the policy data model. The major 
   advantage of this design fashion is the separation of policy data 
   and how to manage these policy data into policy rules. That means, 
   only change the supa-policy-atomic here can generate new policy 
   without redefine all the policy data.  

   -supa-policy-statement: It is used to define the content of a 
   supa-policy, all the event, condition and action clauses are 
   defined here. This part will not be affected by the changing of 
   policy structures or designs.

3.1. supa-policy-target Design for ECA policy data model 

   The supa-policy-target target defines the working object of the 
   policy. More specifically, the scope of the policy will be worked 
   on and the instance that the policy will be worked on. This part 
   should be the input from policy user and is not part of ECA policy 
   itself. E.g., if the bandwidth of a flow of voice stream reaches 
   threshold, more bandwidth will be assigned to guarantee the voice 
   service. Here, which flow is for voice service and will be 
   adjusted is specified by the user as the input of the ECA policy. 
   So some kind of template is needed here to allow users to provide 
   information of the working object of the policy.  

   As shown in figure 3, four attributes of supa-policy-target are 
   defined by the user to specify the working scope of the policy. 
   Then the instance defines the specific work object of the policy, 
   such as a VPN, a flow, a link and so on. Obviously, VPN, flow or 
   link needs different elements to be indicated, so it is can be 
   defined with a "augment" statement to indicate the working object. 
   E.g., if user wants to work on a flow, corresponding elements will 
   be defined within "flow" case.   

      +--rw supa-policy-target 
         +--rw profileType?        string 
         +--rw asDomainName?       string 
         +--rw adminSubnetwork?    string 
         +--rw businessTypeName?   string 
         +--rw instanceName 
            +--rw instanceElement?    empty

3.2. ECA Policy Data Model Design 

   A supa-ECA-policy-rule, is a subclasses of the supa-policy-atomic 
   class. Therefore, it can be used as part of a hierarchy of

   Policies or in a stand-alone manner. The EPRIM specializes the 
   supa-policy-atomic class to create a supa-ECA-policy-rule; it also 
   specializes the supa-policy class to create a supa-ECA-component, 
   and the supa-policy-statement to create corresponding clauses. The 
   supa-ECA-policy-rule uses the rest of the SGPIM infrastructure to 
   define a complete Policy model according to ECA semantics. 

      +--rw supa-policy-atomic 
         +--rw supa-ECA-policy-rule 
            | .... 
            +--rw supa-ECA-component 
            | .... 
 

   Figure 4: The snippet of supa-policy-atomic with ECA policy rule 

   -A supa-ECA-policy-rule is defined as a subclass of the SGPIM 
   supa-policy-atomic class. All the related information of the ECA 
   policy are defined here with some basic attributes of the policy 
   and the supa-ECA-component sub class. 

   -A supa-ECA-component is one of core parts of the policy data 
   model; it defines how the event, condition and action clauses are 
   integrated into one working policy. Note that supa-ECA-component 
   does not define the content of the policy itself but the structure 
   as well the association of each policy statement clauses.  

3.2.1. supa-ECA-component sub class 

   The principal subclasses of supa-policy-component that are defined 
   in this version of this document are supa-policy-events, supa-
   policy-conditions, and supa-policy-actions. Each of the sub 
   classes take care the event, condition and action part of the ECA 
   policy respectively. The snippet of supa-ECA-component sub class 
   is shown in figure 5.

            |  +--rw has-policy-conditions?   boolean 
            |  +--rw conjunctive-type?        enumeration 
            +--rw supa-policy-actions 
               +--rw action-execution?   enumeration

Internet-Draft       SUPA ECA Policy Data Model           October 2015 
    

   The supa-policy-events sub class has one leaf to specify whether 
   the policy has an event statement. If TRUE, the policy will take 
   the event clause defined in the supa-policy-statement class. 

   The supa-policy-conditions sub class defines two things: one, does 
   the policy has conditions, similar to the events part; two, if 
   more than one conditions, how all the conditions are integrated 
   into one single statement. Note that the ECA policy only makes the 
   evaluation of condition statement once. So all the condition 
   clauses needs to be integrated into one statement connected via 
   AND or OR operator. Conjunctive-type defines use AND or OR 
   operator to connect condition clauses.  

   The supa-policy-actions sub class defines how the action clause 
   defined in supa-policy-statement will be executed. 

3.3. supa-policy-statement Design for ECA policy data model 

   This is a mandatory abstract class that separates the 
   representation of a supa-policy from its implementation. This 
   abstraction is missing in [RFC3060], [RFC3460]. Basically, all the 
   policy statements are defined here as clauses. SUPA use three 
   types of mechanisms to define policies, entity, script template 
   and Boolean clause. The statement has three part, event-list, 
   condition-list and action-list, each has one or more clauses.  

   -supa-entity, which is a mechanism to directly use existing 
   defined object as the input of event; this is described in more 
   detail in Section 3.3.1. 

   -supa-script, which is a mechanism to directly encode the content 
   of the supa-policy-statement into a script template and needs 
   further execution which is out of SUPA; this is described in more 
   detail in Section 3.3.2. 

3.3.1. supa-entity sub class 

   This is a mandatory class that specializes a supa-policy-statement. 
   It is defined that then event object can use the predefined object 
   in existing module.  

   -entity can refer to an existing leaf node defined by other module. 
   An example will be given in the following section.

                  Figure 6: The snippet of supa-entity 

   The supa-entity has been defined as a "grouping" to improve 
   reusability. 

3.3.2. supa-script sub class 

   This is a mandatory concrete class that specializes (i.e., is a 
   subclass of) a supa-policy-statement. It defines a generalized 
   extension scripting mechanism for representing supa-policy-
   statement that has not been modeled with other supa policy objects. 
   Rather, the Policy Clause is directly encoded into script template 
   and then been executed in the network management 
   function/controller. 

   -supa-script-content defines the content of this script template. 
   It works with another attribute of the supa-script class, called 
   supa-script-type, which defines how to interpret this script. 
   These two attributes form a tuple, and together enable a machine 
   to understand the script and know how to execute the script. Note 
   that, the scripting approach is to improve the logic expression 
   without defining new logic terminologies. Anything supported by 
   script being used can be accommodated by SUPA. 

   -supa-script-type defines the type of this script being used. It 
   works with another attribute of the supa-script class, called 
   supa-script-content, which defines the content (i.e., the value) 
   of the script template. 

         +--rw supa-script 
            +--rw supa-script-type?    scriptType 
            +--rw supa-script-content 
 
                  Figure 7: The snippet of supa-script 

   The supa-script has been defined as a "grouping" to improve 
   reusability as the event and condition statement can both use the 
   script template.  

3.4. event-list sub class 

   All the event clauses are defined here with either encoded clause 
   or Boolean clause. As shown in figure 8, each event can only be 
   and must one type of the two clauses. Each event clause is defined

   by calling the predefined two types of clauses in a "choice" 
   statement.  

         +--rw event-list 
            +--rw event-name 
               +--rw (eventType)? 
                  +--:(entity) 
                  |  +--rw entity?                 empty 
                  +--:(script) 
                  |  +--rw supa-script-type?       scriptType 
                  |  +--rw supa-script-content 
 
             Figure 8: The snippet of event-list sub class 

3.5. condition-list sub class 

   All the condition clauses are defined using a "augment" statement. 
   If there is more than one condition clause, just simply add more 
   "container" to define more condition clause.  

         +--rw condition-list 
            +--rw condition-name     empty 
 
           Figure 9: The snippet of condition-list sub class 

3.6. action-list sub class 

   The action-list sub class defines all the action clauses those 
   will be executed while the condition statement is being evaluating 
   as TRUE. Since the action can only be defined by users as each 
   action may have different attributes and elements to configure, 
   the predefined structures and statements will not help. Not only 
   the value of the leaf but also the number of leafs will depend on 
   the type of actions. As shown in figure 10, here a "augment" 
   statement is designed to keep the structure of the action 
   statement stable while allows extensibility. The user can define 
   new action by adding more case statement with self-defined element 
   and statement structure without affecting existing one.   

         +--rw action-list 
            +--rw actionName 
               +--rw actionElement?   empty

5. ECA Policy Data Model Example 

   This section will provide one example to show how to use this 
   generic ECA policy data model to generate specific policy data 
   model a service flow policy that can be mapped into configurations. 

   The generic ECA policy data model contains no configuration 
   information and lack of action elements, it cannot be mapped into 
   configuration such as XML instance by just filling the value of 
   the leaves. In order to make a working ECA policy, the user needs 
   to define some part of the generic policy data model and fill in 
   some of the leaves but do not need change the structure. Basically, 
   instantiate a generic ECA policy data model into a specific ECA 
   policy data model only needs adding some leaves and specify some 
   values.  

   More specifically, for a service flow policy "If the bandwidth of 
   a voice stream flow exceeds 8Mbps, change the CIR to 20Mbps to 
   guarantee the voice service", how to use generic ECA data model to 
   generate a working data model to deploy this policy? Instructions 
   with data model will be given in next few sections. The major 
   steps are:  

   1. Fill in the basic attributes of the policy, such as name, 
   priority, valid period and so on.  

   2. Redefine the supa-policy-target 

   3. Specify the leaf value in supa-ECA-component to define how the 
   policy clauses in supa-policy-statement will be integrated into a 
   policy rule. 

   4. Define the event clause, condition clause and action clause 
   using augment statement.

5.1. Redefine the supa-policy-target 

   The first step is to redefine the target of the policy. As shown 
   in figure 12, the user fills in all the attributes to define the 
   working scope of the policy such as the profile, domain and 
   subnet. Then, in order to tell the system which flow to be worked 
   on, the user will define a flow filter with possible elements to 
   get the right flow. Here, dscp value, source IP, destination IP, 
   source port and destination port are attributes needed to indicate 
   a flow. For this working policy, user also fills in the value of 
   each leaf, dscp = 5, src-ip-addr = 10.111.10.1, dst-ip-addr = 
   10.112.10.1, src-port = 8080 and dst-port = 8090. After all this, 
   the desired voice stream flow (dscp=5) will be selected as policy 
   target. 

augment /supa:supa-policy/supa:supa-policy-target/supa:instance: 
   +--rw flowFilter 
      +--rw dscp?          uint32 
      +--rw src-ip-addr?   string 
      +--rw dst-ip-addr?   string 
      +--rw src-port?      uint32 
      +--rw dst-port?      uint32 
 
            Figure 12: The snippet of specific policy target 

   Note that, the supa-policy-target is reusable and extensible as 
   the user can add more instance into case statement without 
   affecting existing one. E.g., user could also add VPN with 
   elements such as VPNName, source IP and destination IP.  

5.2. Define the supa-ECA-component 

   In order to define how the policy clauses are organized and 
   associated into one policy, the user needs to fill in all the leaf 
   value in supa-ECA-component. As shown in figure 13, the 
   corresponding value will be filled in. The policy has event and 
   condition, but only one condition. And the policy will execute a 
   single action if the condition being evaluated as TRUE.

         +--rw action-execution?   enumeration //0: single 
 
          Figure 13: The snippet of specific ECA component 

5.3. Define Event, Condition and Action clause 

   The core part of ECA policy is the policy statement as individual 
   clauses. For the example policy, event is the flow entry, 
   condition is that its bandwidth >= 8M, and action is to do CAR 
   with CIR = 20M. As shown in figure 14, the user first needs to 
   choose the type of event and condition clause. In this case, event 
   clause should be entity and use predefined flow object. Condition 
   clause should be script template to send the bandwidth >= 8M 
   script to the controller. Then design the event and condition 
   clause by filling in the leaf. Note that the choice of clause type 
   does not include in YANG data model but will be accomplished in 
   NETCONF via <edit-config> operation. 

   More specifically, the path of leafref of entity is 
   "/supa:flows/supa:flow/supa:flowId", which pointed to anther 
   module. We suppose that module has already defined the object 
   "flow".  

   For the condition part, the condition elements are defined using 
   augment statement. "bandwidth" and "threshold" leaf are added into 
   "condition-bandwidth" class.

   +--rw condition-bandwidth 
      +--rw bandwidth?   uint32 
      +--rw threshold?   uint32 
 
augment /supa:supa-policy/supa:supa-policy-statement/supa:action-list: 
   +--rw action-redirect 
      +--rw cir?   uint32 
      +--rw pir?   uint32 
      +--rw Cbs?   uint32 
      +--rw Pbs?   uint32 
 
          Figure 14: The snippet of specific policy statement 

   The design of action clause is more complicated as different 
   action has different number and type of attributes to be specified. 
   And the action is only valid when the condition is evaluated as 
   TRUE. So here a "when" statement is used to do the augment. The 
   "when" expression is the Xpath expression to evaluate if the 
   predefined "bandwidth" exceeds the "threshold". 

   Finally, with the refined ECA policy data model as shown in 
   section 6, with working policy "If the bandwidth of a voice stream 
   flow exceeds 8Mbps, change the CIR to 20Mbps to guarantee the 
   voice service" can be mapped into XML instance.
