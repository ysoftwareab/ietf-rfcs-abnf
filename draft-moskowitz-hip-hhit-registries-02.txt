Abstract

   This document describes using the registration protocol and
   registries to support hierarchical HITs (HHITs).  New and existing
   HIP parameters are used to communicate Registry Policies and data
   about the HHIT device and the Registries.  Further Registries are
   expected to provide RVS services for registered HHIT devices.

1.  Introduction

   This document expands on Hierarchical HITs
   [I-D.moskowitz-hip-hierarchical-hit], defining HIP registration
   protocol enhancements, the Registry services to support hierarchical
   HITs (HHITs), and given a HHIT, how to get additional information
   about the device.

   Registries will tend to be organized regionally and by nature of
   their clients.  For example, an RAA may be US centric and only have
   HDAs that are US-based.

   Registries will need to work in a federation.  Devices that are
   clients of one HDA/RAA will be needing information and connectivity
   to devices that are clients of other HDA/RAA.  The policies for
   establishing such federations are outside the scope of this document.

   Access to information at a Registry about a device may require
   authorization.  The nature and process of such an authorization is
   outside the scope of this document.

2.  Terms and Definitions

2.1.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.2.  Definitions

   CSR (Certificate Signing Request):  Request to a Certificate
      Authority to create an X.509 certificate with the provided
      information.

   HDA (Hierarchical HIT Domain Authority):  The 14 bit field
      identifying the HIT Domain Authority under a RAA.

   HID (Hierarchy ID):  The 32 bit field providing the HIT Hierarchy ID.

   RAA (Registered Assigning Authority):  The 18 bit field identifying
      the Hierarchical HIT Assigning Authority.

   RVS (Rendezvous Server):  The HIP Rendezvous Server for enabling
      mobility, as defined in [RFC8004].

3.  Problem Space

Internet-Draft               HHIT Registries                  March 2020


3.1.  Desire for administrative control of HHITs

   For HHITs to be effectively used, the HHIT Domain Authorities (HDAs)
   need to provide information on the HHIT devices.  Minimally this
   would be the corresponding HI, information on the device owner (only
   to authorized requesters), and where in the network the device has
   last reported from.

   The HHIT space creates a type of a business labeling for the HDAs.
   "These are my customers."

3.2.  Desire for administrative control by RVS providers

   An RVS [RFC8004] provider may only be willing to provide discovery
   (RVS) services to HIP devices it knows and trusts.  A flat HIT space
   does not provide any intrinsic functionality to support this.  A HHIT
   space can be mapped to the RVS provider.  DNS can effectively be used
   to provide the HHIT to IP mapping without Distributed Hash
   Table (DHT) [RFC6537].

3.3.  Defense against fraudulent HITs

   How can a host protect against a fraudulent HIT?  That is, a second
   pre-image attack on the HI hash that produces the HIT.  A strong
   defense would require every HIT/HI registered and openly verifiable.
   With HHITs, the HDAs can provide the HI and proof of registration
   (e.g.  X.509 certificate including HHIT).

   This would best be done as either part of the R1 and I2 validation,
   or anytime a HHIT is presented.

4.  HHIT Registry services to support hierarchical HITs

   Hierarchical HIT registration SHOULD be performed using the HIP
   Registration Extension [RFC8003].  The client either uses an X.509
   certificate [RFC8002], or use a PSK, as defined in Appendix A of HIP-
   DEX [I-D.ietf-hip-dex], to validate the registration.

   The Registration should include additional client information.  This
   information may be contained within the X.509 certificate (CERT
   parameter) and/or is carried in the CLIENT_INFO parameter, see
   Section 4.3.4.  The Registrar can include its requirements in the R1
   packet, and the client provide its information in the I2 packet.
   This parameter may be encrypted within the ENCRYPTED parameter.  If
   the CLIENT_INFO contains Personal Identifying Information (PII), then
   it MUST be placed into the ENCRYPTED parameter.

Internet-Draft               HHIT Registries                  March 2020


   The content and internal format of the CLIENT_INFO parameter is set
   by the HDA"s policy and is outside the scope of this document.
   Examples of client information can by phone number, IMEI, and ICCID.

4.1.  Hierarchical HIT Registration using X.509 Certificates

   This requires the HIP client to possess a client certificate trusted
   by the HDA/Registrar.  Registration will either succeed or fail.

   Certificate registration can be a "chicken and egg" problem: where
   did the device get its certificate?  Thus this is more likely used in
   a re-registration situation with updated information.

4.2.  Hierarchical HIT Registration using a PSK

   This requires the HIP client and the HDA/Registrar to share a PSK.
   The PSK is carried in the ENCRYPTED_KEY parameter [I-D.ietf-hip-dex].
   The PSK may already exist prior to starting the registration and just
   be used within the registration.  A PSK out-of-band exchange may be
   triggered by performing the registration without any authentication.

   If no client authentication is included in the I2 packet, the
   registration fails with "No Authentication provided".  If the I2
   packet included the proper HDA required client information, the HDA
   can use it to set up a side channel for an out-of-band delivery of a
   PSK.  And example of this would be to send an SMS message with the
   PSK.  Once the client possesses the PSK, it can rerun the
   registration at which point the HI and HIT duplicate checks are
   performed.

   The I2 packet may contain a CERT parameter containing a CSR, and the
   R2 would return the X.509 certificate for later use.

4.3.  HIP Parameters

   The HIP parameters carry information that is necessary for
   establishing and maintaining a HIP association.  For example, the
   device's public keys as well as the signaling for negotiating ciphers
   and payload handling are encapsulated in HIP parameters.  Additional
   information, meaningful for end hosts or middleboxes, may also be
   included in HIP parameters.  The specification of the HIP parameters
   and their mapping to HIP packets and packet types is flexible to
   allow HIP extensions to define new parameters and new protocol
   behavior.

Internet-Draft               HHIT Registries                  March 2020


4.3.1.  CERT Parameter

   The CERT parameter, [RFC8002], is a container for certain types of
   digital certificates.

   A new CERT Type, CSR, is defined here.  When CERT Type is CSR, CERT
   ID is Zero.  There is only ONE CSR in a CERT Parameter.

    CERT format      Type number       RFC
   -------------     -----------      ----
   PKCS#10 - CSR          9           2986

4.3.2.  Hierarchical HIT Registration Type

   The Registration Type used in the REG_REQUEST is:

   Number   Registration Type
   ------   -----------------
   2        HHIT Registration

4.3.3.  Hierarchical HIT Registration Failure Type

   The Registration may fail.  In fact, with PSK, this may be the
   response to expect an SMS message with the PSK to use in a second
   registration request.  Failure Types used in the REG_FAIL are:

   Failure Type      Reason
   ------------      -----------------------
   [TBD-IANA]        Hierarchical HIT Already Registered
   [TBD-IANA]        HI Already Registered
   [TBD-IANA]        Previously Registered HI with different
                         device information
   [TBD-IANA]        No Authentication provided
   [TBD-IANA]        Invalid Authentication

     Information    required by the HDA.

   This parameter contains client information to include in the HIT
   registration.  The specific content and format is set by the HDA.

4.4.  Registration failure behavior

   If the failure type is "Hierarchical HIT Already Registered", the
   client's HI is hashing to an existing HIT and must generate a new HI
   and hierarchical HIT and re-register.  If the failure is "HI Already
   Registered", the client should assume it is registered.  If the
   failure is "Previously Registered HI with different device
   information", either the client managed to generate a duplicate HI,
   possibly indicating a weak key generation algorithm, or the client
   was previously registered on a different device.  Resolving this
   conflict will be left to the HDA's policy.

4.4.1.  Example of a simple HDA policy

   A simple HDA policy would be to require the device to generate a new
   HI and thus HHIT and try registration again.  The HDA policy may also
   provide a URL for "Previous Registration Resolution".  This contact
   is primarily to assist a device that was registered, but had some
   local failure resulting in a new registration attempt.

4.5.  Example of a simple HDA policy

   A simple HDA policy would be to require the device to generate a new
   HI and thus HHIT and try registration again.  The HDA policy may also
   provide a URL for "Previous Registration Resolution".  This contact
   is primarily to assist a device that was registered, but had some
   local failure resulting in a new registration attempt.

4.6.  HHIT DNS Retrieval Service

   A Registry SHOULD provide DNS retrieval services for the HIP RR
   [RFC8005] for HHITs as described in Hierarchical HITs
   [I-D.moskowitz-hip-hierarchical-hit].

   This requires a Registry to act as a DNS zone Name Server to provide
   minimally the HI for the HHIT in the DNS query.  Registry policy will
   determine if the response can be cached within DNS.  If the Registry
   also provides the HHIT and/or the RVS for the HHIT, this may result
   in a different DNS caching policy by the Registry.

5.  Using hierarchical HITs

   All HIP clients with hierarchical HITs maintain an RVS connection
   with their HDA's RVS server(s).  How the HDA scales this service up
   to a potential population in the millions is out of scope of this
   document.  Lifetime management of these connections is also out of
   scope.

   One approach an HDA can use to address the scaling challenge is to
   add an internal level of hierarchy to assign a set number of devices
   per RVS server.

   Peering agreements between HDAs would allow for geographically close
   RVS to a device.  This may reduce the latency for use of a device's
   current RVS.  This is a subject of another document.

5.1.  Contacting a HIP client

   A service Initiator uses some service to discover the HIT of the
   service Responder.  The Initiator uses the hierarchical information
   in the HIT to find the Responder's RVS.  A trusted RVS discover
   method could use the DNS PTR to RVS as shown in Hierarchical HITs
   [I-D.moskowitz-hip-hierarchical-hit].  An I1 is sent to that RVS
   which forwards it to the Responder.

   The potential Responder uses the HIT in the I1 to query the
   Initiator's RVS about the Initiator.  The nature of information, and
   method of communication are determined by the Initiator's HDA and the
   Responder's (and or HDA"s) relationship with it.  Based on the
   Responder's local policy, this information will be used to determine
   if the contact is to be accepted.  If accepted, the Responder may
   proceed sending an R1 to the Initiator.  It may alternatively
   initiate some non-HIP process.

   It should be noted that this R1 may contain a REG_INFO list for the

   Initiator to validate that the Responder does offer the desired
   service.

5.2.  Defense against fraudulent HITs

   Both the Initiator and Responder MAY validate a peer host as a
   defense against a second pre-image attack on the HHIT.  This may
   occur via a CERT [RFC8002] in R1 or I2.  It may be through a back end
   process associated with the R1 or I2 validation to look up the HHIT
   and retrieve the registered HI.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA will need to make the following changes to the "Host Identity
   Protocol (HIP) Parameters" registries:

   CERT Type:  This document defines the new CERT Type for the CERT
      parameter "PKCS#10 - CSR" (see Section 4.3.1).

   Reg Type:  This document defines the new Registration Type for the
      REG_REQUEST parameter "HIT Registration" (see Section 4.3.2).

   Reg Fail:  This document defines the new Failure Types for the
      REG_FAIL parameter (see Section 4.3.3).

   CLIENT_INFO:  This document defines the new CLIENT_INFO parameter
      (see Section 4.3.4).  The parameter value will be assigned by
      IANA.

7.  RAA Management Organization Considerations

   Introducing the RAA management organization may be the largest hurdle
   for hierarchical HITs.  Thus it would be best if this were adopted by
   an organization already in the business of allocating numbers within
   either the Internet or the Mobile, cellular, infrastructure.

   One consideration would be to reserve the first N RAA values to map
   to the existing DNS TLDs.  For example, these TLDs can be organized
   in an ascending order and numbered accordingly.  Thus the 2 character
   TLDs will be a lower number than the 3 character TLDs.  After that,
   it could be a first come, first numbered assignment process.

8.  Security Considerations

   There are potential risks with the hierarchical HIT, the Registry
   service, and the discovery of potential peer hosts using its
   hierarchical HIT.




Moskowitz, et al.       Expires 10 September 2020               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft               HHIT Registries                  March 2020


   A 64 bit hash space presents a real risk of second pre-image attacks.
   The HHIT Registry services effectively block attempts to "take over"
   a HHIT.  It does not stop a rogue attempting to impersonate a known
   HHIT.  This attack can be mitigated by the Responder using DNS to
   find the HI for the HHIT or the RVS for the HHIT that then provides
   the registered HI.

   The two risks with hierarchical HITs are the use of an invalid HID
   and forced HIT collisions.  The use of the "hhit.arpa."  DNS zone is
   a strong protection against invalid HIDs.  Querying an HDA's RVS for
   a HIT under the HDA protects against talking to unregistered clients.
   The Registry service has direct protection against forced or
   accidental HIT hash collisions.

   By using the HIP Registration Extension, the Registry service is
   protected from direct attacks.  This service does rely on either the
   integrity of a PKI service or an out-of-band PSK delivery process.
   Thus the risk to the Registry service is highly related to the trust
   in these authentication setup services.  Further, the duplicate HI
   resolution process may require human interaction with related social
   engineering risks.

   Finally the peer host discovery process relies on trusting the
   finding the proper HDA for the host and its forwarding the I1 to the
   proper Responder.  A rogue RVS, impersonating the RVS for the HIT,
   could redirect the I1 to a client that has forced a collision with
   the HIT and the Initiator would be none the wiser.  The only defense
   against this is if the Initiator has some other source for the
   Responder HI and validate the HI in the R1.

8.1.  Privacy Concerns

   Mobile-privacy-attack [I-D.moskowitz-mobile-privacy-attack] details
   how Eve can follow a communication between two mobile peers using the
   session Identifiers and deep knowledge about those Identifiers gained
   by hacking servers that log PII related to the Identifiers.

   Hierarchical HITs not only does not mitigate this attack, it can
   actually aggravate it by supplying the HDA where the HHIT is
   registered.

   A HIP Privacy Enhanced Base Exchange, to be defined in a separate
   draft, along with a Privacy Enhanced ESP tunnel, can be used to hide
   all the HIP and ESP Identifiers from Eve.
