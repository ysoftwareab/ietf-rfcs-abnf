Abstract

   This file is a proposal for P2P based Domain Name query stratagy in
   IpV6.  The DNS servers construct n-tuple overlay virtual hierarchical
   overlay network.  With cached addresses of DNS servers, the overload
   of traffic in tree structure can be avoided. This strategy may use
   for Domain Name query and reverse Domain Name query in IpV6 for a
   large number of domain names.

1. Introduction

   Although DNS becomes a vital component in today's Internet
   infrastructure, the existing DNS architecture is unsuitable for the
   growth of the Internet[DINGNS].

   This file is a proposal for P2P based DNS query stratagy in IpV6. The
   DNS servers construct n-tuple overlay virtual hierarchical overlay
   network. With cached addresses of DNS servers, the overload of
   traffic in tree structure can be avoided. This strategy may be used
   in DNS query in IpV6 for a large number of domain names.

   There are huge numbers of IP address in IpV6. Moreover, there may be
   use case for multi domain names associated with a sigle IP address.
   DNS implementation currently used may encounter overload traffic in
   root DNS servers. This document uses VIRGO[VIRGO] overlay network to
   solve the above problem. VIRGO is a multi-tuple virtual hierarchical
   overlay network with cached node address. We here change some places
   to suit the distributed DNS implementation. The lookup protocols of
   DNS  is similar as the protocols in VIRGO[VIRGO], which is
   illustrated in detail in the paper[P2PSD] titled as A P2P service
   discovery strategy based on content catalogues.


2. Virtual Hierarchical Overlay Network for DNS

   Virtual Hierarchical Overlay Network for DNS is a hybrid of
   unstructured P2P and structured P2P technologies. The DNS servers
   construct multi-tuple Virtual Hierarchical Overlay Network. Some
   servers are only leaves of the network,others may coexist in

   different layers. These servers form a duplicated virtual
   hierarchical tree, with one root layer, several middle layers, and
   many leaf virtual nodes. Random connections cached in a DNS server's
   routing table are maintained. The servers in the same domain are
   fully connected. Unlike query pathes currently used  in Domain Name
   Systems allways go to root servers, Virtual Hierarchical Overlay
   Network for DNS routes quest message to the server with theoretical
   least hops from destination server. The route tables of Domain Name
   servers contains two kinds of route addresses, tree addresses, which
   are prerequiste, and cached addresses.

   The following is some terms related to the Virtual Hierarchical
   Overlay Network for DNS.

   Domain Name Server is a node which keeps local domain RRs[RFC1035].
   All the Domain Name Servers are the same except some Domain Name
   Servers take the function of gateways in the meantime. Every Domain
   Name Server just controls the leaves of the domain. Every Domain Name
   Server contains route table. Every Domain Name Server uses its
   controlled domain name by cutting off leaves as its Identification,
   which is called as Domain Name Server Identification (DNSI).For
   example, for Grid.network.computer.science,
   Wireless.network.computer.science, etc., Domain Name Servers have
   Identifications -- network.computer.science.It keeps RRs for
   Grid.network.computer.science,Wireless.network.computer.science,etc.
   The Domain Name Server can be replicated by machines with different
   IP addresses, but all with same RRs and route tables.

   Gateway is a node role which takes part in routing functions in
   several different layers of virtual groups.

   Gateway uppermost layer (denoted by  GUL ) is the uppermost virtual
   group layer that the gateway is in. The layers are ordered from root
   layer which is labelled as level 1.

   Virtual group is formed virtually by the gateways nodes. The Group
   Name is part of the node's domain name, eg. in the above example,
   science, science.computer, science.computer.network are group names.

   N-tuple virtual group tree (denoted by NVGT) is a hierarchical tree
   formed by virtual groups. Among the nodes of the lower layer virtual
   groups, N-tuple gateway nodes in each group are chosen to form upper-
   layer groups, and from the nodes of these upper-layer groups to form
   upper-upper-layer groups in the same way, and this way is repeated
   until a root-layer group is formed.

   In the Virtual Hierarchical Overlay Network for DNS, all Domain Name
   Servers consist of N-tuple virtual group tree. The Virtual

   Hierarchical Overlay Network can be established by manual or
   automatedly by establishment protocol which is shown in Appendix A.


   2.1 DNS Query Strategy

   Every DNS server is the same but some coexist in more than one layer.
   Every DNS Server  maintains a route table and a RR record related to
   its Domain. Route table includes addresses of Foreign Name Servers
   which are prerequiste for Virtual Hierarchical Overlay Network and
   cached addresses  of Foreign Name Servers which are refreshed by TTL
   rule. The query process is shown as the following figure.




                                              |  Foreign
                                              |

                                              |  +--------+   +------+


   The query process is as the following: User program sends QUERY
   MESSAGE to Local Name Server. If Local Name Server is the authoritive
   Domain Name Server, then the Local Name Server will check its RR to
   resolve the request Domain name. Otherwise, The Local Name Server
   will routes to the Foreign Name Server which is closer to the
   authoritive Domain Name Server by calculating theoretical hops. Then
   the Foreign Name Server routes to the even closer Foreign Domain Name
   Server. Repeat this process, until the authoritive Domain Name Server
   has been found. Finally, the authoritive Domain Name Server resolves

   request Domain Name by check its RR record, and responses to the
   Local Name Server. The latter will forward the response to the User
   Program. The details of the algorithm can be found in Appendix A.

   2.2 Route Table Definitions

   All Route Tables have the same top level format shown below, which is
   also called as Domain Server Node Entity(DSNE):

   |IPADDRESSes | IP addresses of the replicated Domain Servers        |
   +------------+------------------------------------------------------+



   2.3 On-demand Domain Names

   Domain Names are introduced as a name that identifies a IP address
   for easy to remember. When a Domain Name for a IP is accessed
   frequently, more IP addresses are mapped into this Domain Name. In
   IpV6, there are so huge IP addresses that every device has at least
   one static IP address. There are also the cases that more Domain
   Names are mapped into one IP address.  It is reseanable to think that
   IP address is the identification for a device. But,Domain Names are
   the roles the device plays in various organizations or activities.
   When a device with a IP address joins several virtual organizations,
   it will have several different Domain Names. For example, a machine
   is the provider of Song of Britney and Madanna, this machine may use
   www.Britney.popular.music and www.Madonna .popular.music as its
   Domain Names. This is called as On-demand Domain Names.

   2.4 Hierarchical Management of Domain Name in IpV6

   In IpV6,there are so many IP addresses, and even more,  more than one
   On-demand Domain Names for a IP; therefore,there may be huge number
   of Domain Names.  Moreover, when we think Domain Names as roles
   involved with activities or virtual organizations, we should permit
   users to use whatever Domain Names.  In such case of huge number of
   Domain Names, it is a reasonable way to manage Domain Name
   Registration in a hierarchical way. The Internet Corporation for
   Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) may govern the root of Domain
   Names. Other level Domain Name may be controlled by  virtual
   organizations organized by the users automatically. For example, in
   Domain Name www.Madonna.popular.music, music Domain is managed by
   music virtual organization, which reports to ICANN to approve,
   popular.music Domain is controlled by  popular music virtual
   organization,which reports to music virtual organization to approve.
   The request of Domain Name www.Madonna.popular.music is sent to
   virtual organization of popular music to be approved. In Domain Name
   www.Beethoven.classic.music, classic.music Domain is controlled by
   classic music virtual organization, which reports to music virtual
   organization to approve. The request of www.Beethoven.classic.music
   is managed by virtual organization of classic music.

   The Domain Names with binding of IP addresses are registered into
   dasebases of Domain Name Servers which are nodes containing leaves in
   Domain Name tree.  These nodes containing leaves in Domain Name tree
   are  Domain Name Servers. For example, www.Madonna.popular.music and
   www.Britney.popular.music are registered into resource records of
   database of their Domain Name Server--popular.music as following:

   www.Madonna.popular.music 3600 IN AAAA
   2001:200:0:8002:203:47ff:fea5:3085

   www.Britney.popular.music 2600 IN AAAA
   1002:c18:107:1235:983:102:12:2031

   The registration of Domain Names can be registered by users
   automatically. When users try to register Domain Names into their
   Domain Name Servers, the Domain Name Servers check the corresponding
   virtual organizations to see whether the Domain Names are valid; if
   the Domain Names are valid, then these Domain Names are registered
   into the Resource Records of databases of the Domain Name Servers.

   Domain Name Servers are virtually architectured as Tree Structure.
   Some Domain Name Servers takes roles of gateways.  When a  Domain
   Name Server joins the network, it first finds one of Domain Name
   Servers  which share the maxmium prefixs with the joining Domain Name
   Server, then the joining server sends the JOINMESSAGE to the

   latter,the latter will broadcast the message to all Domain Name
   Servers in the virtual group. The Network establishment is shown at
   Appendix 4.2.


   2.5 Reverse Resolution

   Reverse Resolution uses .IN-ADDR.ARPA domain today. In IPv6,
   .IP6.ARPA was defined by [RFC3152], and more detail information can
   be found in [RFC3596]. Because IPv6 has a huge Name Space, it is
   difficult to keep reverse RRs in today's architecture.  Here, an
   approach with Virtual Hierarchical Overlay Network for DNS can solve
   the above problem.  Domain Name Servers managing local networks is
   called as the hierarchical address Domain just like Domain Name
   Resolution.  These Domain Name Servers  join the Virtual Hierarchical
   Overlay Network for DNS. The records of route table is the same as
   the  Domain Name Resolution. DNSI(Domain Name Server Indetification
   of an  Domain Server) is like as:
   fea5.47ff.203.8002.0.200.2001.IP6.INT  with Server IP Address
   2001:200:0:8002:203:47ff:fea5:0010 resolutes the Domain Name from
   2001:200:0:8002:203:47ff:fea5:0 to
   2001:200:0:8002:203:47ff:fea5:ffff.  Whereas in Domain Name
   resolution,  popular.music  with Server IP Address
   2001:200:0:8002:203:47ff:fea5:0010 solutes www.***.popular.music
   Domain Names. The servers for popular.music  and
   fea5.47ff.203.8002.0.200.2001.IP6.ARPA can be same or different.
   Reverse Domain Name Servers joins Virtual Hierarchical Overlay
   Network for DNS is the same as  Domain Name Servers , and also use
   protocol shown at Appendix 4.2. The query protocol is also the same
   as Domain Name Resolution, which is shown as Appendix 4.3.  The Total
   address space of IPv6 is huge. But, only the Reserve Domain Name
   Servers managing used IP addresses will join the Virtual Hierarchical
   Overlay Network for DNS. And the worst maxium query steps are 32.
   With route cache the query steps will be less than 32.  Therefore,
   this strategy for Reverse Resolution is feasible.

   Here, DSNELen is the length of Domain Name Node Entity, and DNSILen
   is the length of Domain Name Server Identification.  NumRDS is the
   number of replicated Domain Name Server IP Addresses.

3. Some Notes

   High performance and stable computers are chosen as gateway nodes.
   Because the gateway node not only manages local RRs,but also routes
   messages.  The virtual tree structure requires gateway node stable.

   Due to the prerequiste tree, every Domain Name Server can reach other
   ones.  Due to redundant gateway nodes, the virtual tree can be
   allways maintaned.

   Due to the random cached nodes in the route table of every Domain
   Name Server, the route paths are randomly chosen. This may avoid the
   network trafic in tree-like structure. This may also enhance the
   security of the DNS.

   The time complexity, space complexity and message-cost of the
   proposed architecture is O(log N), where N is the total number of
   Domain Name Servers in the network. Therefore, domain name query is
   effective.

4.  Appendix A: protocols of establishment and lookup


   4.1 Primitives and Functions

        sender.send (message,receiver), sender sends message to receiver

        sender.send(message,receiver (- Set), sender sends message to
        all the receivers belong to a Set

        RouteTableAdd(DSNE,type), add DSNE to route table

        lookup_location(DomainName),find the destination node's location

        LengthOfSamePrefix(DomainName,DomainName), length of shared
        prefixes between two nodes

        LengthOfDomainName(DomainName), the length of  DomainName

        hopDistance2object(pi,DomainName), the theoretical hops from
        the node to the destination node

        selectRouteNodeFromRouteTable(DomainName), choose  next hop node
        from route table

        checkupRRs(QUERYMESSAGE), retrieve RR record  in  RR database


   4.2 Protocol of Network Establishment

   Here, a new Domain Name Server P_join joins the network. If Header of
   DNS Message is set to join, the Message is callaed as JOINMESSAGE;if
   Header of DNS Message is set to accept, the Message is callaed as
   APPROVEMESSAGE.


   1. P_join finds one of Domain Name Servers P_groupToJoin(which
      belongs to virtual group--joinGroup) sharing maximium prefixs with
      P_join.

   2. P_join.send(JOINMESSAGE, P_groupToJoin);

   3. P_groupToJoin.send(JOINMESSAGE, pi (- joinGroup);

   4. (pi (- joinGroup).send(pi.APPROVEMESSAGE, P_join);
            (pi (- joinGroup).RouteTableAdd(P_join.DSNE,TREE);

   5. P_join.RouteTableAdd((pi (- joinGroup).NSNE,TREE);

   6. set joinGroup to one upper group;

   7. set P_groupToJoin = pi (- joinGroup;

   8. repeat step 2 to 7 until replicated nodes no less
      than n-tuple in joinGroup or joinGroup is root group.


   4.3 lookup protocol

   Here, if Header of DNS message is set to query, the DNS Message is
   callaed as QUERYMESSAGE;if Header of DNS message is set to response,
   the DNS Message is callaed as RESULTMESSAGE.

        Step 1  UserProgram.send (QUERYMESSAGE, LocalNameServer)

        Step 2  authoritiveDNServer =
                LocalNameServer.lookup_location(QUERYMESSAGE.DomainName)

        Step 3  RESULTMESSAGE=
                authoritiveDNServer.checkupRRs(QUERYMESSAGE);

        Step 4  authoritiveDNServer=send(RESULTMESSAGE,
   LocalNameServer);

        Step 5  LocalNameServer.send(RESULTMESSAGE, UserProgram);

        Step 6
   LocalNameServer.RouteTableAdd(authoritiveDNServer.DSNE,CHACHE);



   Where, function of lookup_location (locates the destination node by
   the minimum  hops) is as following:

    Function  p.lookup_location(QUERYMESSAGE) {

          if LengthOfSamePrefix(p.DNSI,QUERYMESSAGE.DomainName)==
                 LengthOfDomainName(QUERYMESSAGE.DomainName)-1

                 return p;

          else {

             routeP =
               p.selectRouteNodeFromRouteTable(QUERYMESSAGE.DomainName);

             p.send(QUERYMESSAGE,routeP);

             if (message sending is  successful)
                routeP.lookup_location(QUERYMESSAGE);

             else {

                Mark routeP as unreachable in p.routetable;

                p.lookup_location(QUERYMESSAGE); }
            }
           }

   Where, function selectRouteNodeFromRouteTable(select route with
   theoretical least hops from destination Domain Name Server) is as
   following:


     Function  p.selectRouteNodeFromRouteTable(requestDomainName)

      gnSet =
         Minimum(p.hopDistance2object(pi (- RouteTable,requestDomainName));

      return routeP = random(gnSet);

      Where,  function hopDistance2object (calculating theoretical hops
   from destination Domain Name Server) is as following:


      Function p.hopDistance2object(pi,requestDomainName)

        if LengthOfSamePrefix(pi.DNSI, requestDomainName) ==1

           return LengthOfDomainName(requestDomainName)+pi.GUL -3;

        elseif pi.GUL < LengthOfSamePrefix(pi.DNSI, requestDomainName)

           return  LengthOfDomainName(requestDomainName) -
                LengthOfSamePrefix(pi.DNSI, requestDomainName)-1;

        else

           return LengthOfDomainName(requestDomainName)+pi.GUL -
                2*LengthOfSamePrefix(pi.DNSI,requestDomainName)-1
