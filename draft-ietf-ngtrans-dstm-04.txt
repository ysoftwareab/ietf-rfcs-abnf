1. Introduction

The initial deployment of IPv6 will require a tightly coupled use of
IPv4 addresses to support the interoperation of IPv6 and IPv4, within an
IPv6 Network.  Nodes will still need to communicate with IPv4 nodes that
do not have a dual IP layer supporting both IPv4 and IPv6.  The Dual
Stack Transition Mechanism (DSTM) provides a method to assign temporary
Global IPv4 Addresses to IPv6/IPv4 nodes over a native IPv6 Network, use
of dynamic tunnels within an IPv6 Network to carry IPv4 traffic, and a
defined set of processes and architecture for the supporting
infrastructure required for this transition mechanism.

The DSTM assigns, when needed an IPv4 address to a dual IP layer node.
This will allow either IPv6 nodes to communicate with IPv4-only nodes,
or for IPv4-only applications to run without modification on an IPv6
node. This allocation mechanism is coupled with the ability to perform
dynamic tunneling of an IPv4 packet inside an IPv6 packet, to hide IPv4
packets in the native IPv6 domain.  This will simplify the network
management of IPv6 deployment, since routers need only IPv6 routing
tables to move IPv4 packets across an IPv6 network.  This means that we
manage one routing plan for IPv6 only.

DSTM is targeted to help the interoperation of IPv6 newly deployed
networks with existing IPv4 networks. DSTM assumes that a user will
deploy an IPv6 network to reduce the need and reliability on IPv4 within
a portion of their network.  In addition the IPv4 globally routable
address space available to the network is a scarce resource, and the
user may not want to deploy DHCPv4[15] to assign temporary IPv4
addresses to IPv6 nodes, and would rather require those nodes to use
IPv6 to obtain or be given the IPv4 temporary addresses from DHCPv6.
Also, to reduce the IPv4 applications a user has to support and to
obtain a temporary IPv6 IPv4-Mapped Address (see Section 6), the client
only has to run a DHCPv6 client process with the DTI mechanisms in this
specification.

The DSTM architecture is composed of a DHCPv6 server, that provides for
the assignment of IPv4 Global Addresses to IPv6 Hosts.  The DHCPv6
server will allocate temporary IPv4 Global Addresses to IPv6 nodes. The
DHCPv6 server will also be used to maintain the mapping between the
allocated IPv4 address and the permanent IPv6 address of the node. Each
IPv6 DSTM will have an IPv4 interface called the Dynamic Tunneling
Interface (DTI) designed to encapsulate IPv4 packets into IPv6 packets.
Also a DSTM daemon exists working with a DHCPv6 client to resolve the
address space mechanics, between IPv4 and IPv6.

The specification will begin by defining the terminology (section 2),
then section 3 provides a technical overview of the DSTM methodology as
a transition mechanism.  Then in section 4 we provide a DSTM example.
Section 5 describes the DTI Architecture and Section 6 discusses the
DHCPv6 option requirements.  Section 7 provides the DSTM Applicability

2. Terminology



2.1 IPv6 DSTM Terminology


   DSTM Domain             The network areas on an Intranet where a
                           DHCPv6 Server has access to IPv6 nodes participating
                           in DSTM for that network, and IPv4 routing access
                           is not necessary within a DSTM domain.

   DSTM Border Router      A border router within a DSTM domain and
                           access to an external IPv4-ONLY domain.

   DSTM Host               A Host that supports a dual IP layer IPv4
                           and IPv6 stack, DTI, and a DHCPv6 Client
                           process.

   IPv6 Protocol Terms:    See [3]

   IPv6 Transition Terms:  See [14]

   DHCPv6 Terms:           See [4]

2.2 Specification Language


   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification, in accordance with RFC 2119 [8]. These words
   are often capitalized.

      MUST          This word, or the adjective "required", means that
                    the definition is an absolute requirement of the

                    specification.

      MUST NOT      This phrase means that the definition is an absolute
                    prohibition of the specification.

      SHOULD        This word, or the adjective "recommended", means
                    that there may exist valid reasons in particular
                    circumstances to ignore this item, but the full
                    implications must be understood and carefully
                    weighed before choosing a different course.
                    Unexpected results may result otherwise.

      MAY           This word, or the adjective "optional", means that
                    this item is one of an allowed set of alternatives.
                    An implementation which does not include this option
                    MUST be prepared to interoperate with another
                    implementation which does include the option.

      silently discard
                    The implementation discards the packet without
                    further processing, and without indicating an error
                    to the sender. The implementation SHOULD provide
                    the capability of logging the error, including the
                    contents of the discarded packet, and SHOULD record
                    the event in a statistics counter.



3. DSTM Overview and Assumptions

DSTM as discussed in the introduction is a method which uses existing
protocols.  DSTM does not specify a protocol. However, DSTM defines a
new DHCPv6 Option for transition.

The motivation for DSTM is to provide IPv6 nodes a means to acquire an
IPv4 Global Address, for communications with IPv4-only nodes or IPv4
applications.

The core assumption within this mechanism is that it is totally
transparent to applications, which can continue to work with IPv4
addresses. It is also transparent to the network which carry only IPv6
packets.  It is the authors viewpoint that the user in this case, has
deployed IPv6 to support end to end computing, without translation.
This aspect is fundamental during a transition process to guarantee that
every existing application will continue to work (e.g. IPsec, H.323),
which embed IPv4 addresses in the payload of a packet.

The DSTM model and assumptions are as follows:

  - The DSTM domain is within an Intranet not on the Internet.


Bound,Toutain,Afifi,Dupont,Durand  Expires July 2001            [Page 6]


INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-ietf-ngtrans-dstm-04.txt         Feruary 2001


  - IPv6 nodes do not maintain IPv4 addresses except on a temporary basis,
    to communicate with IPv4-only and IPv4 Applications.

  - Standard DHCPv6 is used to support the extension to provide
    and accept from DHCPv6 Servers Global IPv4 Addresses.

  - The DSTM domain for the IPv6 nodes will keep IPv4 routing
    tables to a minimum and use IPv6 routing, hence, reducing
    the network management required for IPv4 during transition.

  - Once IPv6 nodes have obtained IPv4 addresses Dynamic Tunneling is
    used to encapsulate the IPv4 packet within IPv6 and then forward
    that packet to an IPv6 TEP, where the packet will be decapulated and
    forwarded using IPv4.  DHCPv6 is used to provide TEPs to IPv6 nodes
    supporting DTI, as part of the new DHCPv6 Option.

  - Existing IPv4 applications or nodes do not have to be modified to
    communicate with DSTM.

  - Implementation defined software will have to exist to support DSTM:

    o  Ability within a DHCPv6 Server implementation to maintain
       configuration information about TEPs for encapsulating IPv4
       packets between IPv6 nodes that can forward IPv4 packets to an
       IPv4 routing realm, and to maintain a pool of Global IPv4
       Addresses.

    o  Software within an IPv6 node to support the dynamic tunneling
       mechanisms in this specification to encapsulate IPv4 packets
       within IPv6 on an IPv6 node.  In addition
       a daemon must exist to access a DHCPv6 client for Global IPv4
       Mapped Addresses and TEPs. How this daemon communicates with
       a DHCPv6 Client implementation is implementation defined, and
       left as an exercise for implementors of this transition
       mechanism.

    o  Software in DSTM Border Routers to recall or be able to cache
       the association of IPv6 and IPv4 addresses of nodes during
       decapsulation and encapsulation.

For an IPv6 node to participate in DSTM it MUST have a dual IP layer,
supporting both an IPv4 and an IPv6 stack.  DSTM is not a solution for
IPv6 ONLY nodes.

4.1 DSTM Client/Server Example

This example describes the case where an application (either compiled
for the IPv6 or IPv4 API) running on an IPv6 node (X6) wants to
establish a session with an IPv4 application on an IPv4-only node (Z4).

The IPv6 node is configured with the IPv6 address of a TEP, where an
IPv4 encapsulated packet will be sent.

The IPv4 routing table of node X is configured to send IPv4 packets to
the DTI interface.

        DHCPv6
        DNS
   X6          Y6/Y4          Z4
    |            |            |
    |. . . . . . . .>    Z    |    - X6 asks the DNS for the A RR for "Z"
    |<. . . . . . . .    Z4   |    - the answer is Z4
    |            |            |
    |            |            |    - The application sends its first IPv4
    |            |            |      packet which arrives to the DTI interface
    |            |            |      (If the application is compiled for IPv6
    |            |            |      this can be done through an IPv4-mapped
    |            |            |      address).
    |            |            |
    |            |            |    - X6 needs an IPv4 address (first use)
    |====>       |            |    - X6 queries the DHCPv6 server for an
    |            |            |      IPv4 address using DHCPv6
    |<====       |            |    - The DHCPv6 server locates the client
    |            |            |      and provides a temporary IPv4
    |            |            |      global address.
    |+++++++++++>|            |    - The DTI sends the IPv6 packet to the
    |            |            |      TEP.
    |            |----------->|    - Y sends the packet to the destination Z4
    |            |            |    - Y caches the association between
    |            |            |      the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of X.

When Z responds the packet returns back through Y.  Y having cached the
association between the IPv4 and the IPv6 address of X, is able to send
the packet encapsulating the IPv4 packet within IPv6 back to X.



5 DTI Architecture

In the absence of an IPv4 routing infrastructure, a DSTM node can not
directly send IPv4 packets on the network. It has to encapsulate them
into IPv6 packets and send them to a tunnel end point (TEP) that will
decapsulate them and inject them in the IPv4 network.



Bound,Toutain,Afifi,Dupont,Durand  Expires July 2001           [Page 10]


INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-ietf-ngtrans-dstm-04.txt         Feruary 2001


On a DSTM node, this encapsulation is done by the DTI interface.  An
IPv4 packet can be directed to that interface by an IPv4 routing table
entry.

The exact details of the DTI interface and the associated routing table
entries are implementation dependant.



5.1 Assignment of the IPv4 address to the DTI

When the DTI interface is activated, an IPv4 address is not given to
that interface. When it has to send the first IPv4 packet, a request is
sent to the DHCPv6 client. The DHCPv6 client will send a DHCPv6 request
to the DHCPv6 server to get the temporary IPv4 Global Address and a TEP.

An IPv6 node can know it needs an IPv4 address if the DNS resolver on
the node knows that the destination address will be an IPv4 address.




5.2 DTI Encapsulation of IPv4 packets

The next header type for IPv4 encapsulation is 4 (as for IPv4 tunneling
over IPv4). When a tunneled packet arrives to the IPv6 destination, the
IPv6 header is removed and the packet is processed by the IPv4 layer.
The DSTM Border Router SHOULD cache the association between the IPv4 and
IPv6 source addresses.  The IPv4 packet will then be forwarded by the
DSTM border router using the IPv4 infrastructure.

The IPv6 source address of an encapsulated packet will be the IPv6
address of the interface on which the IPv6 packet will be sent.



5.3 DTI IPv6 destination address

When a DTI has to encapsulate an IPv4 packet into an IPv6 packet, the
DTI has to determine the TEP IPv6 address for the destination. The TEP
can be the node destination or, if the destination node is IPv4-only,
the IPv6 address of an IPv4/IPv6 DSTM Border Router.

The TEP can be either statically configured or dynamically acquired when
the IPv6 node acquires an IPv4 Compatible Address from a DHCPv6 Server.

The TEP SHOULD be provided by the DHCPv6 server when the DSTM node
receives an IPv4-Mapped IPv6 Address (section 6).  But, a DSTM node MAY
manually configure the TEP during early deployment of IPv6, this will
not scale and is not recommended as a long term transition solution.

6. DHCPv6 Requirements

The DSTM processes will use the DHCPv6 services [4] to communicate
between the DHCPv6 Server and the DHCPv6 Client. A new option is
required for DHCPv6 to support DSTM. But there are some additional
requirements placed on the DSTM processes that are not specific to the
DHCPv6 protocol as a transition and interoperation set of mechanisms for
the IPv6 node.

DHCPv6 clients solicit servers, and servers advertise their
availability. Then DHCPv6 clients request configuration parameters, and
a server sends those parameters back in a reply message.  The client
requests parameters by specifying options with the DHCPv6 request
messaqge.  This new DSTM option will request that the server return an
IPv4-Mapped IPv6 address to the client.

DHCPv6 servers also support a Reconfigure message sent to clients to ask
clients to initiate a request message for a specific option.  This
permits DHCPv6 servers to offer clients IPv4-Mapped IPv6 addresses.



6.1 DHCPv6 Global IPv4 Address Option

The DHCPv6 IPv4 Address Option informs a DHCPv6 Client or Server that
the Identity Association Option (IA) [4] following this option will
contain an IPv4-Mapped IPv6 Address [19] in the case of a DHCPv6 Client
receiving the option, or is a Request for an IPv4-Mapped IPv6 Address
from a client in the case of a DHCPv6 Server receiving the option.  The
option can also provide an IPv6 address to be used as the TEP to
encapsulate an IPv4 packet within IPv6.

This option can be used with the DHCPv6 Request, Reply, and
Reconfigure-Init Messages for cases where a DHCPv6 Server wants to
assign to clients IPv4-Mapped IPv6 Addresses, thru the Option Request
Option (ORO) in DHCPv6.

   An IPv4 Global Address Option MUST only apply to the IA
   following it this option.




6.1.1 Client Request of IPv4 Global Address

When the client requests an IPv4 address from the DHCPv6 Server the TEP
field MUST not be present in the Global IPv4 Address Option.



6.1.2 Server Reply of IPv4 Global Address Option

The server will reply to the client with a Global IPv4 Address Option,
that can contain an IPv6 Address Tunnel End Point, and an IA Option
which MUST include an IPv4 IPv6-Mapped Address.  The IA Option is
provided as a reference in this document [4].


The format of the IA option is:

      0                   1                   2                   3

   fields are repeated for each address in the IA option (as determined
   by the ``num-addrs'' field).




6.1.3 Client Processing of IPv4 Address Option

The processing of the IPv4 Global Address Option on the client is
implementation defined but here are some guidelines for developers.

When processing the IA Option following the IPv4 Global Address Option,
an IP Address provided will be an IPv4-Mapped IPv6 Address.  A
conceptual implementation model would be to add this address to the
nodes IPv6 mechanisms that maintain timing procedures for IPv6 addresses
on the IPv6 stack, and then configure the IPv4 interface for DTI, as a
procedure called from the DHCPv6 client.

As the IPv4 IPv6-Mapped Address is an IPv6 address all other processing
for DHCPv6 is as specified in that document, the IPv4 Global Address

INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-ietf-ngtrans-dstm-04.txt         Feruary 2001


Option just informs the client that an address within the IA option will
be an IPv4 IPv6-Mapped Address.



6.2 Server Processing of an IPv4 Address Option

When a DHCPv6 Server receives an IPv4 Global Address Option in a DHCPv6
Request message, the client is requesting an IPv4 IPv6-Mapped Address.

A DHCPv6 Server can send a Client a Reconfigure-Init message using the
IPv4 Global Address Option to ask the Client to request an IPv4 Global
Address thru an ORO.  The Client will then send a request to the server
for an IPv4 IPv6-Mapped Address.

The Server will know a priori the Clients IPv6 routable address, when
sending a Reconfiguration-Init message.

The Server will look in its implementation defined IPv4 Address
configuration to determine if a TEP is available for a specific IPv6
Address Prefix. If that is the case the Server will put the address for
the TEP in the Global IPv4 Address Option.



6.3 Client Processing of an IPv4 Address Option

When the Server supplies an IPv4 Global Address in a Reply.

The Client MUST not update the DNS with this new address.

A conceptual model to configure an IPv4 IPv6-Mapped address on a client
is as follows:

   1.  In an implementation defined manner the Client MUST assign the
       address to an interface, supporting the Client's IPv4 stack
       implementation.

   2.  In an implementation defined manner the Client MUST create an entry
       as an IPv4-Mapped IPv6 Address supporting the processing required
       for an IPv6 address regarding the valid and preferred lifetimes
       as specified in IPv6 Addrconf [18].  Once the IPv4-Mapped IPv6
       Address valid lifetime expires the IPv4 address MUST be deleted
       from the respective interface and a DHCPv6 Release Message
       MUST be sent to the DHCPv6 Server to delete the IPv4 IPv6-Mapped
       Address from the Servers bindings.

   3.  If a TEP address is provided in the Global IPv4
       Address Option, the Client MUST create a configured tunnel
       to the TEP address, in an implementation defined

INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-ietf-ngtrans-dstm-04.txt         Feruary 2001


       manner. These encapsulation mechanisms are defined
       in other IPv6 specifications [12, 14].




7. Applicability Statement

DSTM is applicable for use from within the DSTM Domain to IPv4 nodes or
applications on a user Intranet or over the Internet.

DSTM's motivation is to support dual IP layer DSTM node to communicate
using global IPv4 addresses across an Intranet or Internet, where global
addresses are required.  But, DSTM has been defined to also permit the
use of Private IPv4 address space to permit the Intranet use of DSTM
where users require temporary access to IPv4 services within their
Intranet.

DSTM requires the use of DHCPv6 to obtain IPv4 addresses and TEPs for a
DSTM node.  Communications between the DSTM Daemon and the DHCPv6 client
is implementation defined.  The DTI mechanism is also implementation
defined.  DSTM does permit optionally for DSTM node to manually
configure TEPs for DTI for early deployment of DSTM but highly
recommends not doing this and configuring DHCPv6 servers with this
information is really the way to execute DSTM on an IPv6 Network.

DSTM also assumes that all packets returning from an IPv4 node to a DSTM
dual IP layer node return through the orginating DSTM Border Router
which has cached the association of the DSTM's IPv4+IPv6 addresses.  At
this time it is beyond the scope of DSTM to permit IPv4 packets destined
for DSTM node to return packets through a non-orginating DSTM border
router.

DSTM also through the new DHCPv6 extension permits Network Operators to
inform DSTM Hosts they will need IPv4 addresses for communications using
the DHCPv6 Reconfigure-Init message.

DSTM as future work can be extended to support multiple border routers
for returning IPv4 packets, and for the discovery of DSTM node using
IPv4 DNS queries as future work for DSTM.



8. Security Considerations

The DSTM mechanism can use all the defined security specifications for
each functional part of the operation. For DNS the DNS Security
Extensions/Update can be used [9, 10], for DHCPv6 the DHCPv6
Authentication Message can be used [4], and for communications between
the IPv6 node, once it has an IPv4 address, and the remote IPv4 node,

INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-ietf-ngtrans-dstm-04.txt         Feruary 2001


IPsec [7] can be used as DSTM does not break secure end-to-end
communications at any point in the mechanism.



Changes from draft 03 to draft 04

   1.  Changed DHCPv6 options and processing to comply with
       draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-16.txt



Changes from draft 02 to draft 03

   1.  Working Group Edits



Changes from draft 01 to draft 02


   1.  Added futher clarifications to DSTM components.

   2.  Added client/server details for DHCPv6 ngtrans extension.

   3.  Removed optional scenarios to simplify this mechanism.

   4.  Removed AIIH concepts and changed to be DSTM components.

   5.  Add Applicability Statement

   6.  Added acknowledgment section and new coauthors Francis Dupont
       and Alain Durand.




Changes from draft 00 to draft 01


   1.  Added text explaining why the draft does not use DHCPv4 to assign
       IPv4 compatible addresses to the "Introduction".

   2.  Defined what is mandatory and what is optional and added relative
       text in various places to clarify this change.  And added RFC
       2119 adjectives to the spec where appropriate.

   3.  Scenario 1 where IPv6 node wants to communicate with IPv4
       node is mandatory.



Bound,Toutain,Afifi,Dupont,Durand  Expires July 2001           [Page 17]


INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-ietf-ngtrans-dstm-04.txt         Feruary 2001


   4.  Scenarios 2 and 3 are now optional where an IPv6 node is
       assigned an IPv4 compatible address because an external
       IPv4 node is attempting communications with the IPv6 node.

   5.  For scenario 1 DHCPv6 is only needed for DSTM and not the
       tightly coupled paradigm of a co-existent DHCPv6 and
       DNS server.  Also added mandatory and optional to the
       DSTM AIIH/NODE/ROUTER Diagram.

   6.  Made Static Tunnel Endpoints mandatory and Dyanmic Tunnel
       End Points optional.

   7.  Fixed DHCPv6 Reconfigure statements to take into account
       changes to the Reconfigure message in the DHCPv6 working
       group, to support AIIH processing.
