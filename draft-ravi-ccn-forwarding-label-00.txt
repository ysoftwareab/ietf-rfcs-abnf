                Forwarding-Label support in CCN Protocol
                   draft-ravi-ccn-forwarding-label-00

Abstract

   This document motivates the need for a forwarding-label which is
   another name that can be used in forwarding, in addition to the
   mandatory name in a CCNx Interest message.  Forwarding-label once
   inserted by a edge router can be modified en-route towards the
   producer.  Forwarding-label can be used for several purposes such as
   to support routing scalability, producer mobility, multi-protocol
   support, or for fast forwarding.  We describe its encoding format,
   and rules followed by a forwarder while processing it.  We also
   illustrate its use by applying it towards producer mobility.  This
   draft scopes the use of forwarding-label within a closed trusted
   domain, while the use of it by applications is not ruled out.

1.  Motivation

   Forwarding-label provides flexibility to forward Interests on a name
   other than the one in the Interest message, and they are modifiable
   in the network.  There are many situations when a forwarding-label
   can be used.

   o  To handle producer mobility wherein efficient routing can be
      achieved through late-binding mechanism enabled as part of the
      mobility service handled by the network.

   o  To address routing scalability, the forwarding-label allows to
      forward the Interests on a smaller set of locater names leading to
      domains capable of forwarding over location independent names.

   o  To conduct service indirection, where service Interests can be
      handled in an opportunistic manner, for e.g. routing optimization.

   o  To enable multi-protocol support, wherein overlaid applications
      with different Interest/Data semantics can be forwarded through a
      CCN network fabric.

   o  For fast forwarding Interest packets, to mitigate the cost of
      lookup on variable sized hierarchical names in the FIB.

   Each of these use cases requires a control plane infrastructure to
   use the forwarding-label feature appropriately and avoid malicious
   usage, we provide a discussion of its use in the case of producer
   mobility in Section 9.

2.  Forwarding-Label Management

   Forwarding-label is used in scenarios where routing by Interest name
   is not efficient or scalable.  Hence its use should be strictly
   controlled to avoid exploitation.  In this draft the discussion
   assumes such closed trusted environments like provider networks,
   where forwarding-label are inserted, swapped, or removed at
   designated points in the network.

   Forwarding-label being a network feature, edge routers shouldn't
   anticipate Interests with forwarding-label over its user-to-network
   interface (UNI).  If it does, the network policy dictates if it
   trusts such re-directions or not.  At the same time we don't exclude
   the case of use of forwarding-label by end applications.

3.  On the Wire

   Forwarding-label is modifiable by the network, hence proposed as a
   hop-by-hop field in the optional body of the fixed header as shown in
   Figure 1.  A new forwarding-label optional header of type Locater-
   Name is assigned to support this.  Locater-Name (Figure 2) is a
   hierarchically structured variable length ID [1].  A locater-name
   implies an indirection point such as an AS-, Gateway-, or Service-
   ID.  In addition to the Name TLV, security attributes such as
   authentication information can be included as well depending on
   specific use case scenarios.

4.  Forwarding Label Processing Rules

   The following discussion is based on the assumption that all
   forwarders must process optional header fields, and rules of
   processing when it encounters a forwarding-label of type locater-
   name.

   o  During Interest packet processing when the forwarding decision is
      being made, if a locater-name is available then it should be
      preferred to the name in the Interest message for forwarding, even
      if there is an entry to forward the Interest based on the name in
      the Interest message.

   o  If the lookup based on locater-name succeeds then two
      possibilities exist: for non-terminating flows, the FIB lookup
      results in a next hop and the Interest is forwarded ; for



Ravindran & ChakrabortiExpires September 10, 2015               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft       Forwarding-label support in CCN          March 2015


      terminating flows, if the locater-name matches the name of a local
      service, the service either re-resolves the Interest name to
      another locater-name or can decide to remove it and subject the
      Interest to regular processing based on the name in the Interest
      message.

   o  If the FIB lookup based on the locater-name fails, then the router
      can try to forward it based on the Interest message name.  If the
      latter fails, then the router could raise a error condition and
      feedback the message to the previous hop with appropriate error
      code.

   o  This draft doesn't address the case when a forwarder encounters
      Interests with multiple forwarding-labels, even though there may
      be services that can use this feature to leverage multi-path route
      towards the producer(s).  A forwarder treats this case as an error
      condition and notifies the previous hop.  This issue can also be
      addressed at the first router inserting the forwarding-label, i.e.
      if the router performing the Interest name to forwarding-label
      mapping has a set of labels to choose from, it only inserts one of
      them considering routing policies or other service requirements.

5.  PIT Processing Implications

   To maintain simplicity of forwarding logic the purpose of forwarding-
   label should be to guide the Interest to the producer, hence only be
   used for forwarding decision and not required for content object
   processing, however there may be other usage scenarios which may use
   it for content object processing too.  We present both these
   scenarios.

   If forwarding-label is decoupled from the Interest name,
   consideration here is towards Interests for the same name arriving
   with different forwarding-labels.  To handle this situation, PIT is
   required to save the forwarding-label along with the Interest message
   attributes.  While processing such Interests, even though they can be
   aggregated as usual, the recent Interest should be forwarded to serve
   the purpose of the forwarding-label.  Also in this case the returning
   content object needn't include the forwarding-label, as it is not
   used to match the pending Interests in the reverse path.

   There may be scenarios when it is required to insulate the choice of
   one Interest's forwarding-label from another.  In this case, the
   returning content object should carry back the forwarding-label and
   match it against the pending PIT entry before forwarding to the
   previous hop.  Also if the forwarding-label is swapped by
   intermediate routers, then the content object should be appended with

Internet-Draft       Forwarding-label support in CCN          March 2015


   the right forwarding-label to ensure the PIT match, these
   considerations are similar to those elaborated in [7].

6.  Caching Implications

   The considerations here follows from our discussion in the previous
   section.  If usage of forwarding-label is decoupled from the Interest
   name, then the content object doesn't contain the forwarding-label
   and this information is not used against the incoming Interests.  If
   there is a implicit security binding between the Interest name and
   the forwarding-label then the forwarding-label state is saved along
   with the content object, and should be matched against the incoming
   Interests before the cached content object is returned.

7.  Multiple Domain Scenario

   In wide area network scenarios, Interests cross multiple domains.  If
   forwarding-label is only trusted within domain boundaries, then the
   forwarding-label is removed before forwarding the Interest to the
   next domain, or this can also be performed by ingress node of the
   domain, which then inserts a new forwarding label with associated
   security attributes.

   The domain level scope of the labels also comes at a cost of
   performing Interest name to forwarding-label lookup in each domain.
   But if sufficient trust exists between domains to use the forwarding-
   label inserted by the previous domain, then the intermediate domains
   could avoid name lookup to determine the appropriate forwarding-
   label.

8.  Security Considerations

   In general hop-by-hop fields are exposed to security threats
   emanating from threats like router compromise; however the
   exploitation of the forwarding-label is also related to the purpose
   it is used for and the control plane mechanism used to manage them.
   Depending on the use case scenario of the forwarding-label
   appropriate security mechanisms should be applied to secure the
   control and data planes to avoid exploitation of this feature.  We
   elaborate this in the case of producer mobility in Section 9.

9.  Use Case Scenarios

   Here we provide the discussions related to using forwarding-label in
   different scenarios.

9.1.  Handling Producer Mobility

   In this scenario we show the use of forwarding-label to handle
   producer mobility [4][6].

9.1.1.  Mobility as Network Service

   Forwarding-label based proposal [4] stresses on routing efficiency
   achieved by network-based mobility service using a name resolution
   system.  The proposal supports inter- session/domain mobility, while
   intra-session mobility can be supported through signaling between the
   attachment points and using the forwarding-label to re-direct the
   flow to the new attachment point.

9.1.2.  Differentiating Mobile Flows

   Supporting mobility service incurs cost in terms of control and data
   plane overhead.  Hence means to identify flows that require mobility
   support is required to avoid the default case of treating all
   Interest flows failing the FIB lookup to be treated as requiring
   mobility support.  This can be can be inferred in multiple ways: 1)
   consuming application explicitly identifying it in the Interest
   packet, either through fixed header marking or through metadata
   attributes in the Interest message; 2 ) by a certain prefix component
   in the Interest name indicating the use of the mobility service.

9.1.3.  Using Forwarding-Label

   A high level description of using the forwarding-label for producer
   mobility is given below.

   o  For Interest which require the use of mobility service, the edge
      service router invokes the name resolution system querying it with
      the name in the Interest payload.  The result of name resolution
      is a locater-name.

   o  This name is inserted as a forwarding-label TLV in the Interest
      packet and used in the FIB decision process.

   o  Once the Interest reaches the router owning the locater-name, the
      mobility service logic is invoked to check if the Interest name is
      a locally registered prefix (only true if the Interest arrives at
      the mobile device's attachment point).  If so, the forwarding-
      label is removed and the Interest is forwarded based on the FIB;
      else another name resolution lookup is performed and a new
      locater-name is inserted in the Interest and forwarded to the next
      hop using the new forwarding-label.




Ravindran & ChakrabortiExpires September 10, 2015               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft       Forwarding-label support in CCN          March 2015


   o  The resolved names can be cached locally in the router, so that
      future Interests belonging to the same flow can be resolved
      locally instead of performing a name resolution lookup.

   o  Forwarding-label enables re-direction of Interest to producer's
      latest location enabling mobility for devices within a domain or
      between domains.  While name resolution system updates are
      effective to handle mobility at longer timescales; forwarding-
      label can be used to late-bind Interests when the device hand-
      overs from one attachment point to another, enabling seamless
      mobility during the current session.

9.1.4.  Name Resolution System

   A name resolution system is required to map the persistent name to
   the locater-name.  The system could be a global name resolution
   system or a decentralized system.  The discussion here is based on a
   decentralized name resolution system.

   Compared to flat-ID, human readable name semantic can be used to
   derive the name of the home-domain's resolution controller where the
   names of the mobile entities can be resolved.  For e.g.,
   /enterprise/alice/phone can be resolved by contacting the domain
   controller managed by alice's enterprise, whose name could be
   /enterprise/mobility-controller.  The registration of a mobile prefix
   is done by the attachment-point receiving the prefix-registration
   request from the mobile node (MN) i.e. the producer.  The attachment-
   point then registers the prefix to the name resolution system.  When
   ever the MN moves to another domain, the domain's mobility controller
   updates the home controller about the MN's latest location.

9.1.5.  Example

   This example is discussed considering a decentralized name resolution
   system, considering ATT as the service provider.

   We assume the mobility of device mP is handled by attachment point
   AP-x which is the first CCN hop from mP. mP desires to register a
   prefix /Att/mP/Shared-Video/ for mobility support.  It sends a prefix
   registration message to AP-x, which registers it with its local name
   resolution system and also as an entry in its own FIB.  The mapping
   information in the local domain controller maps service name /Att/mP/
   Shared-Video/ to the forwarding-label /Att/mobility. /Att/mobility is
   assumed to be served by a set of border nodes in the Att domain.
   Routing optimization can be achieved by creating further hierarchy of
   this prefix.





Ravindran & ChakrabortiExpires September 10, 2015               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft       Forwarding-label support in CCN          March 2015


   When consumer C requests for content from this service, assuming the
   Interest is marked as a mobile flow, the edge service router in C1's
   domain requests resolution of /Att/mP/Shared-Video/ to its own domain
   controller.  C's domain controller determines Att as its home domain
   and forwards the request to /Att/mobility-controller for resolution.
   When the edge service router in C's domain receives the forwarding-
   label response, i.e. /Att/mobility, it is appended to the Interest
   message for forwarding.  If the domains trusts the forwarding-label
   from its neighboring domains, /Att/mobility is enough to forward the
   Interest to Att border router(s) servicing mobile entities.  Else,
   the forwarding-label is popped and pushed by the border nodes at the
   inter-domain boundary.

   Once the Interest arrives at the border routers servicing the prefix
   /Att/mobility, the service further resolves the name through its
   local domain controller to the current attachment point, in this case
   /AP-x.  The forwarding-label is updated by the border router and
   forwarded towards AP-x.  If the mobile prefix is still actively
   registered at AP-x, it is forwarded to mP, else AP-x can attach
   another forwarding-label to forward the Interest to the new AP-y,
   this handles the case of seamless mobility.

9.1.6.  Securing Forwarding-Label

   Generally, the major threats against the forwarding label approach is
   to manipulate the mapping between the name and the forwarding-label.
   Such manipulations can happen in various scenarios, some of which are
   listed as follows: (i) a malicious interceptor (acting as a
   publisher) intentionally injects incorrect mapping into the name
   resolution system; (ii) the malicious interceptor (between the edge
   router and the resolution server) manipulates the mapping sent back
   from the name resolution system when the edge router queries the
   mapping system ; or (iii) compromised intermediate routers
   maliciously change the forwarding-label, e.g., with the wrong
   forwarding-label or out-dated forwarding-label.  Appropriate security
   mechanisms should be applied to provide mapping provenance, mapping
   integrity and anti-replay attack to address these issues.  The
   security mechanisms applicable to (i) and (ii) are similar to ones
   applied to secure other mapping systems such as LISP [2],DNS[3],
   (iii) requires new security mechanisms, one such way is to enable a
   domain level trust infrastructure so that the mapping between the
   name and the forwarding-label can be authenticated by successive
   routers.
