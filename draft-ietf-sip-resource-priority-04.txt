Abstract

   This document defines two new SIP header fields for communications
   resource priority, namely "Resource-Priority" and
   "Accept-Resource-Priority".  The "Resource-Priority" header field can
   influence the behavior of SIP user agents, such as telephone gateways
   and IP telephones, and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) proxies.  It
   does not directly influence the forwarding behavior of IP routers.

Internet-Draft           SIP Resource Priority               August 2004


1.  Introduction

   During emergencies, communications resources including telephone
   circuits, IP bandwidth and gateways between the circuit-switched and
   IP networks may become congested.  Congestion can occur due to heavy
   usage, loss of resources caused by the natural or man-made disaster
   and attacks on the network during man-made emergencies.  This
   congestion may make it difficult for persons charged with emergency
   assistance, recovery or law enforcement to coordinate their efforts.
   As IP networks become part of converged or hybrid networks along with
   public and private circuit-switched (telephone) networks, it becomes
   necessary to ensure that these networks can assist during such
   emergencies.

   Also, users may want to interrupt their lower-priority communications
   activities and dedicate their end system resources to the
   high-priority communications attempt if a high-priority
   communications request arrives at their end system.

   There are many IP-based services that can assist during emergencies.
   This memo only covers real-time communications applications involving
   the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261], including
   voice-over-IP, multimedia conferencing, instant messaging and
   presence.

   SIP applications may involve at least five different resources that
   may become scarce and congested during emergencies.  These resources
   include gateway resources, circuit-switched network resources, IP
   network resources, receiving end system resources and SIP proxy
   resources.  IP network resources are beyond the scope of SIP
   signaling and are therefore not considered here.

   In order to improve emergency response, it may become necessary to
   prioritize access to SIP-signaled resources during periods of
   emergency-induced resource scarcity.  We call this "resource
   prioritization".

   The mechanism itself may well be in place at all times, but only
   materially affect call handling during times of resource scarcity.

   Currently, SIP does not include a mechanism that allows a request
   originator to indicate to a SIP element that it wishes the request to
   invoke such resource prioritization. To address this need, this
   document adds a SIP protocol element that labels certain SIP
   requests.

   This document defines (Section 3) a new SIP [RFC3261] header field
   for communications resource priority, called 'Resource-Priority' This

Internet-Draft           SIP Resource Priority               August 2004


   header field MAY be used by SIP user agents, including General
   Switched Telephone Network (GSTN) gateways and terminals, and SIP
   proxy servers to influence their treatment of SIP requests, including
   the priority afforded to GSTN calls.  For GSTN gateways, the behavior
   translates into analogous schemes in the GSTN, for example the ITU
   Recommendation Q.735.3 [Q.735.3] prioritization mechanism, in both
   the GSTN-to-IP and IP-to-GSTN directions.  ITU Recommendation I.255.3
   [I.255.3] is another example.

   The 'Resource-Priority' header field may be used in several
   situations. A SIP request with such an indication can be treated
   differently in these situations:

   1.  The request can be given elevated priority for access to GSTN
       gateway resources such as trunk circuits.
   2.  The request can interrupt lower-priority requests at a user
       terminal, such as an IP phone.
   3.  The request can carry information from one multi-level priority
       domain in the telephone network, e.g., using the facilities of
       Q.735.3 [Q.735.3], to another, without the SIP proxies themselves
       inspecting or modifying the header field.
   4.  In SIP proxies and back-to-back user agents, requests of higher
       priorities may displace existing signaling requests or bypass
       GSTN gateway capacity limits in effect for lower priorities.

   This header field is related to, but differs in semantics from, the
   'Priority' header field (RFC 3261 [RFC3261], Section 20.26).  The
   'Priority' header field describes the importance that the SIP request
   should have to the receiving human or its agent.  For example, that
   header may be factored into decisions about call routing to mobile
   devices and assistants and call acceptance when the call destination
   is busy.  The 'Priority' header field does not affect the usage of
   GSTN gateway or proxy resources, for example.  In addition, any User
   Agent Client (UAC) can assert any 'Priority' value, while access to
   resource priority values is subject to authorization.

   While the 'Resource-Priority' header does not directly influence the
   forwarding behavior of IP routers or the use of communications
   resources such as packet forwarding priority, procedures for using
   this header to cause such influence may be defined in other
   documents.

   Existing implementations of RFC 3261 that do not participate in the
   resource priority mechanism follow the normal rules of RFC 3261,
   Section 8.2.2:  "If a UAS does not understand a header field in a
   request (that is, the header field is not defined in this
   specification or in any supported extension), the server MUST ignore
   that header field and continue processing the message." Thus, the use

Internet-Draft           SIP Resource Priority               August 2004


   of this mechanism is wholly invisible to existing implementations
   unless the request includes the Require header field with the
   resource-priority option tag.

   The mechanism described here can be used for emergency preparedness
   in emergency telecommunications systems, but is only a small part of
   an emergency preparedness network and is not restricted to such use.

   The mechanism aims to satisfy the requirements in [RFC3487].  It is
   structured so that it works in all SIP and Real-Time Transport
   Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550] transparent networks defined in [RFC3487].
   In such networks, all network elements and SIP proxies let valid SIP
   requests pass through unchanged.  This is important since it is
   likely that this mechanism will often be deployed in networks where
   the edge networks are unaware of the resource priority mechanism and
   provide no special privileges to such requests.  The request then
   reaches a GSTN gateway or set of SIP elements that are aware of the
   mechanism.

   For conciseness, we refer to SIP proxies and user agents (UAs) that
   act on the 'Resource-Priority' header field as RP actors.

   We define the header field syntax in Section 3 and then describe the
   behavior of user agents and proxies in Section 4.3 through Section
   4.5.  Section 6 briefly describes how this feature affects existing
   systems that do not support it.  Third-party authentication is
   discussed in Section 5, while general security issues are enumerated
   in Section 8.  This specification does not propose any new SIP
   security mechanisms.  Examples can be found in Section 7.

2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119] and indicate requirement levels for compliant
   implementations.

3.  The Resource-Priority and Accept-Resource-Priority SIP Header Fields

   This document defines the 'Resource-Priority' and
   'Accept-Resource-Priority' SIP header fields.

   The SIP element behavior is described for user agent clients (UACs)
   in Section 4.3, for UAS in Section 4.4 and for SIP proxy servers in
   Section 4.5.

Internet-Draft           SIP Resource Priority               August 2004


3.1  The 'Resource-Priority' Header Field

   The 'Resource-Priority' header field marks a SIP request as desiring
   prioritized resource access, as described in the introduction.  In
   responses, the 'Resource-Priority' header fields indicates the actual
   resource priority that was granted to the request.  While it is
   likely that responses contain the same 'Resource-Priority' header
   field value as the requests, local policy MAY call for the UAS to
   insert no header field or a different value.

   There is no requirement that all requests within a SIP dialog or
   session use the 'Resource-Priority' header field.  Again, local
   policy dictates the appropriate behavior; thus, implementations MUST
   be configurable accordingly.

   The syntax of the 'Resource-Priority' header field is described
   below.  The "token-nodot" production is copied from [RFC3265].

   Resource-Priority  = "Resource-Priority" HCOLON
                        r-value *(COMMA r-value)
   r-value            = namespace "." r-priority
   namespace          = token-nodot
   r-priority         = token-nodot
   token-nodot        = 1*( alphanum / "-"  / "!" / "%" / "*"
                               / "_" / "+" / "`" / "'" / "~" )

   An example 'Resource-Priority' header field is shown below:

   Resource-Priority: q735.1, dsn.flash

   The 'Resource-value' parameter in the 'Resource-Priority' header
   indicates the resource priority desired by the request originator.
   Since a request may traverse multiple administrative domains with
   multiple different namespaces, it is necessary to be able to
   enumerate several different namespaces.  However, each namespace MUST
   NOT appear more than once in a SIP message.

   Each resource value is formatted as 'namespace' '.' 'priority value'.
   The value is drawn from the namespace identified by the 'namespace'
   token.  Namespaces and priorities are case-insensitive ASCII.  Each
   namespace has at least one priority value.  Namespaces and priority
   values within each namespace MUST be registered with IANA (Section
   9).  Initial namespace registrations are described in Section 9.5.

   There may be multiple resource values or, equivalently, multiple
   'Resource-Priority' header field instances.

Internet-Draft           SIP Resource Priority               August 2004


3.2  The 'Accept-Resource-Priority' Header Field

   The 'Accept-Resource-Priority' response header field enumerates the
   resource values a SIP user agent server is willing to accept.  The
   syntax of the 'Accept-Resource-Priority' header field is as follows:

   Accept-Resource-Priority = "Accept-Resource-Priority" HCOLON
                              [r-value *(COMMA r-value)]

   An example is given below:

   Accept-Resource-Priority: dsn.flash-override,
     dsn.flash, dsn.immediate, dsn.priority, dsn.routine


3.3  Usage of the 'Resource-Priority' and 'Accept-Resource-Priority'
    Header Fields

   The following table extends the values in Table 2 of RFC3261
   [RFC3261].  (The PRACK method, labeled as PRA, is defined in
   [RFC3262], the SUBSCRIBE (labeled SUB) and NOTIFY (labeled NOT)
   methods in [RFC3265], the UPDATE (UPD) method in [RFC3311], the
   MESSAGE (MSG) method in [RFC3428], the REFER (REF) method in
   [RFC3515], the INFO (INF) method in [RFC2976], and the PUBLISH (PUB)
   method in [I-D.ietf-sip-publish].)

   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   Resource-Priority        R     amdr   o   o   o   o   o   o   o

   Accept-Resource-Priority 417   -      m   -   m   m   m   m   m
   Accept-Resource-Priority 420   -      o   -   o   o   o   o   o

   Accept-Resource-Priority 420   -      o   o   o   o   o   o   o

   Other request methods MAY define their own handling rules; unless
   otherwise specified, recipients MAY ignore these header fields.
   'Accept-Resource-Priority' MUST be returned in 420 (Not Supported)
   responses marked as 'o' in table above if the element implements the
   resource priority mechanism with some other namespaces or priority
   values, but does not implement the particular namespace or priority

   value contained in the request.

   While all methods listed above allow the optional use of the
   'Resource-Priority' header fields, only request methods that start a
   dialog or deliver content, such as MESSAGE, are likely to benefit
   from this mechanism and other methods SHOULD NOT use them.  This
   consideration also applies to methods not listed above.

3.4  The 'resource-priority' Option Tag

   This document also defines the "resource-priority" option tag. The
   behavior is described in Section 4.2.2 and the IANA registration is
   in Section 9.2.

4.  Behavior of SIP Elements that Receive Prioritized Requests

4.1  General Rules

   All SIP user agent servers and proxy servers that receive SIP
   requests share certain common behavior, which we describe below.
   Behavior that is specific to user agent servers is covered in Section
   4.4, while Section 4.5 deals with proxy behavior.

   A SIP element supporting this specification MUST be able to interpret
   the 'Resource-Priority' header field in INVITE, ACK, PRACK [RFC3262],
   MESSAGE [RFC3428], UPDATE [RFC3311], SUBSCRIBE [RFC3265] and NOTIFY
   [RFC3265] requests, if it supports a particular request.  (This does
   not imply that all elements supporting this specification need to
   support all of these request methods.) In all such requests, the
   priority MAY influence the order in which requests are handled and
   MUST influence the resources, such as circuits, bandwidth or memory,
   allocated based on the request.  For example, for SUBSCRIBE, a
   higher-priority request may get preferential treatment if storage or
   bandwidth for notifications are scarce, possibly displacing a
   lower-priority subscription.  (As always, the precise behavior is
   defined by a namespace definition, or, if left unspecified, by an
   implementation or configuration.)

   A SIP element MAY ignore the header field in other requests unless
   the request definition defines behavior for the particular method.

   If a request contains multiple valid namespace and priority values,
   the request is treated according to the highest priority value which
   the recipient supports and authorizes.  The total ordering of
   priorities between different namespaces is defined by local policy.

   An OPTIONS request can be used to determine if an element supports
   the mechanism.  A compliant implementation MUST return a

Internet-Draft           SIP Resource Priority               August 2004


   'Accept-Resource-Priority' header field in OPTIONS responses
   enumerating all valid resource values.  An implementation MAY reveal
   this capability only to authorized UACs.  (Note that an overloaded
   UAS may not be able to provide this information at all times.) Note
   that according to RFC 3261, proxies reached with a Max-Forwards value
   of zero answer the OPTIONS request, allowing a UAC to discover the
   capabilities of both proxy and user agent servers.

4.2  Error Conditions

4.2.1  Known Namespace and Priority Value

   Two error conditions can occur if a request reaches an element that
   supports the namespace and resource priority. Elements receiving
   requests with namespaces or priority values that they do not
   understand act according to the rules in the next section.

   Insufficient authorization: If the element receives a request with a
      namespace and priority value it recognizes, but the originator is
      not authorized for that level of service, the element MUST return
      a 403 (Forbidden) response.
   Insufficient resources: If there are insufficient resources at an
      element for a given priority, a request might be delayed or
      refused, depending on local policy or the definition of the
      namespace.  If it is refused, the element returns a 503 (Service
      Unavailable) response.  The response MAY also include a 'Warning'
      header with warning code 370 (Insufficient Bandwidth) if the
      request failed due to insufficient capacity for the media streams,
      rather than insufficient signaling capacity.

      The 503 (Service Unavailable) response provides sufficient
      indication to the originator to re-attempt with a higher
      appropriate resource priority or to add a resource priority
      indication, if authorized.

4.2.2  Handling Unknown Namespaces and Priority Values

   When handling requests with unknown namespaces or priority values,
   elements can operate in two modes, "strict" and "loose", identified
   by the presence or absence of a 'Require' header field with the
   'Resource-Priority' option tag.  If the request includes a 'Require'
   header field with the 'Resource-Priority' option tag, a UAS MUST
   follow the strict-mode rules, otherwise UAS and proxies MUST operate
   in loose mode.  Both are described in detail below.

   The use of the 'resource-priority' option tag in 'Proxy-Require'
   header field is NOT RECOMMENDED.

Internet-Draft           SIP Resource Priority               August 2004


4.2.2.1  Strict Mode

   Following standard SIP behavior (Section 8.2.2.3 of [RFC3261]), a UAS
   operating in strict mode MUST reject the request with response code
   420 (Bad Extension) if it does not support the resource priority
   option tag.

      For example, a gateway that is unaware of a resource priority
      namespace might accept a request at non-elevated priority, but
      then the request could later be preempted by other requests.
      Also, use of the 'Require' restriction ensures that in parallel
      forking, only branches that support the resource priority
      mechanism succeed.

   In strict mode, an element that receives a request with a
   'Resource-Priority' header field containing one or more namespace or
   priority values that it does not implement rejects the request with
   status code 417 (Unknown Resource-Priority).  Implementations MUST,
   as a configurable option, support returning a
   'Accept-Resource-Priority' header field enumerating all the resource
   values that the server is willing to process, but network operators
   MAY disable returning this information.  Note that the user may not
   be authorized to use all of these resource values.

      Strict mode is particularly useful for operational testing of
      systems supporting resource priority, as otherwise it might be
      difficult to detect under non-overload conditions whether an
      element supports the functionality or not.

4.2.2.2  Loose Mode

   In loose mode, unknown priority values or namespaces are ignored; the
   request is treated as if these values were not included.  If there
   are no valid priority values or namespaces, the request is treated as
   if it had no 'Resource-Priority' header field.  Thus, no 417 (Unknown
   Resource-Priority) is generated.

4.3  User Agent Client Behavior

   SIP UACs supporting this specification MUST be able to generate the
   'Resource-Priority' header field for requests that require elevated
   resource access priority.

   If the request is returned with 417 (Unknown Resource-Priority), the
   UAC MAY retry the request with a different set of namespace/priority
   combinations, drawing from the values returned by the
   'Accept-Resource-Priority' header field in the response.

Internet-Draft           SIP Resource Priority               August 2004


4.4  User Agent Server Behavior

   If the UAS understands the resource value, but refuses to honor the
   request with elevated priority for this particular user, it returns
   the 403 (Forbidden) response code.  It MAY include the list of
   resource values that the user is allowed to use in the
   'Accept-Resource-Priority' response header field.

      The lookup of the authorized values may take significant resources
      since it may involve an AAA interaction.  Thus, it seems imprudent
      to require that the list is customized to the user.  In general,
      legitimate users know their highest resource value that they are
      entitled to.

   The precise effect of the 'Resource-Priority' indication depends on
   the type of UAS, the namespace and local policy.  For example, a
   circuit-switched telephony gateway might move requests with elevated
   priority to the front of the queue of requests waiting for outbound
   lines, it may utilize additional resources or it may preempt existing
   calls.  For a terminal, such as a SIP phone, requests with elevated
   priority might trigger a special alert tone or preempt other,
   lower-priority existing calls.  The generic protocol mechanism
   described here does not mandate the particular element behavior, but
   namespace definitions, such as the ones in Section 9.5, MUST describe
   the desired behavioral properties of user agents and proxy servers.

4.5  Proxy Behavior

   SIP proxies MAY ignore or inspect the 'Resource-Priority' header
   field.  SIP proxies MAY reject any unauthenticated request bearing
   the header field.

   If there are multiple namespace or priority choices available to the
   user agent client, a proxy MAY return the request with an appropriate
   'Accept-Resource-Priority' header field.  Details are a matter of
   local policy.

   If the header fields are protected via S/MIME encapsulation in a SIP
   message fragment [RFC3420], the 'Resource-Priority' value cannot be
   changed or added by proxies.

   If no S/MIME is used, SIP proxies MAY downgrade or upgrade the
   'Resource-Priority' of a request or insert a new 'Resource-Priority'
   header if allowed by local policy.

      This behavior is similar to that for any header field, as a UA can
      decide to reject a request for the presence, absence or value of
      any information in the request. The session policy mechanism does



Schulzrinne & Polk     Expires February 27, 2005               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft           SIP Resource Priority               August 2004


      not fit well, as user agents may not have a choice in the
      namespace or priority available to them, there are no privacy
      concerns and the resource priority mechanism does not involve
      message bodies or session descriptions.

   If a stateful proxy has authorized a particular resource priority
   level and if it offers differentiated treatment to responses
   containing resource priority levels, the proxy SHOULD ignore any
   higher value contained in responses, to avoid that colluding user
   agents artificially raise the priority level.

      It is unlikely that the resource priority value in responses will
      have any influence on response handling.

      A SIP proxy MAY use the 'Resource-Priority' indication in its
      routing decisions, e.g., to retarget to a SIP node or SIP URI that
      is reserved for a particular resource priority.

      There do not appear to be any special considerations when forking
      requests containing a resource priority indication.

      Otherwise, the proxy behavior is the same as for user agent
      servers Section 4.4).

5.  Third-Party Authentication

   In some case, the RP actor may not be able to authenticate the
   requestor or determine whether an authenticated user is authorized to
   make such a request.  In these circumstances, the SIP entity may
   avail itself of general SIP mechanisms that are not specific to this
   application.  The authenticated identity management mechanism
   [I-D.ietf-sip-authid-body] allows a third party to verify the
   identity of the requestor and certify this towards an RP actor.  In
   networks with mutual trust, the SIP asserted identity mechanism
   [RFC3325] can help the RP actor determine the identity of the
   requestor.

6.  Backwards Compatibility

   The resource priority mechanism described in this document is fully
   backwards compatible with SIP systems following [RFC3261].  Systems
   that do not understand the mechanism can only deliver standard, not
   elevated, service priority. User agent servers and proxies can ignore
   any 'Resource-Priority' header field just like any other unknown
   header field and then treat the request like any other request.
   Naturally, the request may still succeed.

   Introducing 'Require' or 'Proxy-Require' would not help backwards

Internet-Draft           SIP Resource Priority               August 2004


   compatibility, as systems that do not support these mechanism are no
   better off rejecting the request due to feature failure.  Since the
   intent of resource priority indications is to increase the
   probability of call completion, adding failure modes appears
   counterproductive.

   RFC 3665 [RFC3665] and omitted for brevity.

7.2  Receiver Does Not Understand Namespace

   In this example, the receiving UA does not understand the "dsn"
   namespace and thus returns a 417 (Unknown Resource-Priority) status
   code.  We omit the message details for messages F5 through F7 since
   they are essentially the same as in the first example.

8.  Security Considerations

   Any resource priority mechanism can be abused to obtain resources and
   thus deny service to other users.  An adversary may be able to take
   over a particular gateway, cause additional congestion during PSTN
   during emergencies or deny service to legitimate users.

   While the indication itself does not have to provide separate
   authentication, any SIP request carrying such information has higher
   authentication requirements than regular requests.  Below, we
   describe authentication and authorization aspects, confidentiality
   and privacy requirements, protection against denial of service
   attacks and anonymity requirements.  Naturally, the general
   discussion in RFC 3261 [RFC3261] applies.

Internet-Draft           SIP Resource Priority               August 2004


   All user agents and proxy servers which support this extension MUST
   implement SIP over TLS [RFC3546] and the sips: URI scheme as
   described in Section 26.2 of RFC 3261, and Digest Authentication
   [RFC2617] as described in Section 22 of RFC 3261. In addition, user
   agents which support this extension SHOULD also implement S/MIME
   [RFC2633] as described in Section 23 of RFC 3261 to allow for signing
   and verification of signatures over requests which use this
   extension.

8.1  Authentication and Authorization

   Prioritized access to network and end system resources imposes
   particularly stringent requirements on authentication and
   authorization mechanisms since access to prioritized resources may
   impact overall system stability and performance, not just result in
   theft of, say, a single phone call.

   Under certain emergency conditions, the network infrastructure,
   including its authentication and authorization mechanism, may be
   under attack.

   Given the urgency during emergency events, normal statistical fraud
   detection may be less effective, thus placing a premium on reliable
   authentication.

   Common requirements for authentication mechanisms apply, such as
   resistance to replay, cut-and-paste and bid-down attacks.

   Authentication MAY be SIP-based or use other mechanisms.  Use of
   Digest authentication and/or S/MIME is RECOMMENDED for UAS
   authentication.  Digest authentication requires that the parties
   share a common secret, thus limiting its use across administrative
   domains.  SIP systems employing resource priority SHOULD implement S/
   MIME at least for integrity, as described in Section 23 of [RFC3261].
   However, in some environments, receipt of asserted identity [RFC3325]
   from a trusted entity may be sufficient authorization.  Section 5
   describes third-party authentication.

   Trait-based authorization [I-D.ietf-sipping-trait-authz] "entails an
   assertion by a authorization service of attributes associated with an
   identity" and may be appropriate for this application.  With
   trait-based authorization, a network element can directly determine,
   by inspecting the certificate, that a request is authorized to obtain
   a particular type of service, without having to consult a mapping
   mechanism that converts user identities to authorizations.

   Authorization may be based on factors beyond the identity of the
   caller, such as the requested destination.  Namespaces MAY also



Schulzrinne & Polk     Expires February 27, 2005               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft           SIP Resource Priority               August 2004


   impose particular authentication or authorization consideration that
   are stricter than the baseline described here.

8.2  Confidentiality and Integrity

   Calls which use elevated resource priority levels provided by the
   'Resource-Priority' header field are likely to be sensitive and often
   need to be protected from intercept and alteration.  In particular,
   requirements for protecting the confidentiality of communications
   relationships may be higher than for normal commercial service.  For
   SIP, the 'To', 'From', 'Organization' and 'Subject' header fields are
   examples of particularly sensitive information.  Systems MUST
   implement encryption at the transport level using TLS and MAY
   implement other transport-layer or network-layer security mechanisms.
   UACs SHOULD use the "sips" URI to request a secure transport
   association to the destination.

   The 'Resource-Priority' header field can be carried in the SIP
   message header or can be encapsulated in a message fragment carried
   in the SIP message body [RFC3420].  To be considered valid
   authentication for the purposes of this specification, S/MIME signed
   SIP messages or fragments MUST contain, at a minimum, the Date, To,
   From, Call-ID, and Resource-Priority header fields.  Encapsulation in
   S/MIME body parts allows the user to protect this header field
   against inspection or modification by proxies.  However, in many
   cases, proxies will need to authenticate and authorize the request,
   so that encapsulation is undesirable.

   Removal of a Resource-Priority header field or downgrading its
   priority value affords no additional opportunities to an adversary
   since that man-in-the-middle could simply drop or otherwise
   invalidate the SIP request and thus prevent call completion.

   Only SIP elements within the same administrative trust domain
   employing a secure channel between their SIP elements will trust a
   Resource-Priority header field that is not appropriately signed.
   Others will need to authenticate the request independently.  Thus,
   insertion of a Resource-Priority header field or upgrading the
   priority value has no further security implications except causing a
   request to fail (see discussion in the previous paragraph).

8.3  Anonymity

   Some users may wish to remain anonymous to the request destination.
   Anonymity for requests with resource priority is no different than
   for any other authenticated SIP request.  For the reasons noted
   earlier, users have to authenticate themselves towards the SIP
   elements carrying the request where they desire resource priority



Schulzrinne & Polk     Expires February 27, 2005               [Page 18]

Internet-Draft           SIP Resource Priority               August 2004


   treatment.  The authentication may be based on capabilities and noms,
   not necessarily their civil name.  Clearly, they may remain anonymous
   towards the request destination, using the network-asserted identity
   and general privacy mechanism described in [RFC3323].

8.4  Denial-of-Service Attacks

   As noted, systems described here are likely to be subject to
   deliberate denial-of-service (DoS) attacks during certain types of
   emergencies.  DoS attacks may be launched on the network itself as
   well as its authentication and authorization mechanism.  As noted,
   systems should minimize the amount of state, computation and network
   resources that an unauthorized user can command.  The system must not
   amplify attacks by causing the transmission of more than one packet
   to a network address whose reachability has not been verified.

9.  IANA Considerations

    'Accept-Resource-Priority' Header Fields

   [NOTE TO RFC EDITOR:  Replace RFC XXXX with RFC number of this
   document.]

   header field:

   Header name: Accept-Resource-Priority
   Compact form: none

9.2  IANA Registration for Option Tag resource-priority

   RFC number: XXXX
   Name of option tag: 'resource-priority'

      priority mechanism.

   RFC number: XXXX
   Response code: 417
   Default reason phrase: Unknown Resource-Priority

9.4  IANA Namespace and Priority Registrations

   Additional namespaces and priority values MUST be registered with
   IANA. Within each namespace, the registration may indicate the
   relative precedence levels, expressed as an ordered list.  New labels
   should not be added to existing namespaces.  The registration MUST
   describe, in the registration itself or by reference, how SIP
   elements should treat requests from that namespace, e.g., whether
   preemption or only preferential queueing are allowed.  A reference to
   a stable external document, e.g., by the International
   Telecommunication Union, other SDOs or national regulatory bodies,
   suffices.  An expert review, by an expert designated by the Transport
   Area Director or designate, is required.

   Namespaces do not describe how they relate to other existing
   namespaces, as each namespace is independent of other registrations.

   Below is a template for the registration of a new namespace:

   Namespace: Designation of the namespace, according to the BNF
      'namespace' in Section 3.
   Description: Description of the use and application of this
      particular namespace.
   Documentation: If applicable, reference to a document describing the
      namespace in more detail.
   Organization: If applicable, organization defining this namespace.
      (For example, an IETF standards-track RFC could also define a
      namespace, not just an external organization.)
   Policy: Either if not defined normatively elsewhere or for
      informative purposes, this element describes how a SIP element
      handles requests containing priority values with this namespace.
      There are many possible behaviors that cannot be exhaustively
      anticipated.  Three common behaviors are preemption, precedence
      and threshold-exemption. Preemption means that a request with
      greater priority can displace an existing request with lower
      priority that is already in progress. Precedence means that a
      higher-priority request assumes a position in the queue ahead of a
      lower-priority request, but any in-progress request is not
      affected by its arrival.  In addition, systems with preemption MAY
      specify whether requests that cannot obtain resources immediately
      are queued or rejected immediately.  Threshold-exemption allows
      higher-priority calls to access resources, such as circuits, that
      are unavailable to lower-priority calls, e.g., because they are
      held in reserve.  If the namespace does not define a particular

      policy, the term 'implementation-defined' should be used.
   Priority values (least to greatest): A list of priority values,
      ordered from least to highest priority.

      "network control" and "internetwork control", as these are
      inappropriate here.
   Documentation: ANSI T1.619, Section B1
   Organization: United States Department of Defense, Defense
      Information Systems Agency (DISA).
   Policy: Preemption with rejection.
   Priority values (least to greatest): "routine", "priority",
      "immediate", "flash", "flash-override"

9.5.3  Namespace ets

   Namespace: ets
   Description: Emergency Telecommunications Service (ETS) specifies
      Signaling System No.  7 (SS7) and Bearer Independent Call Control
      (BICC) protocols for (Government) Emergency Telecommunications
      Service (ETS) for authorized users with national security and
      emergency preparedness responsibilities.  The namespace "ets"
      supports interworking with ATIS.ETS (or equivalent) PSTN,
      including ISDN, entities.  This interworking allows, for example,
      carrying signaling information between ATIS.ETS entities without
      loss of information.  One or both of the SIP endpoints might be
      PSTN gateways.  The namespace "ets" allows, based on policy, to
      provide priority treatment in processing and allocating resources
      to call and session requests marked with this namespace.

   Namespace: q735
   Description: ITU Q.735.3 describes multi-level precedence and
      preemption in SS7.  The namespace "q735" supports interworking
      with Q.735.3 (or equivalent) GSTN (ISDN) entities; this allows,
      for example, carrying information between Q.735.3 entities without
      loss of information.  One or both of the SIP endpoints might be
      PSTN gateways.
   Documentation: Q.735.3 [Q.735.3]

9.5.5  Namespace wps

   Namespace: wps
   Description: Description: Wireless Priority Service (WPS) extends
      (Government) Emergency Telecommunications Service (ETS)-like
      priority treatment to authorized users with national security and
      emergency preparedness responsibilities who use mobile terminals
      to place voice or voice-band data calls. The namespace "wps"
      supports interworking with ATIS.TR.WPS (or equivalent) PSTN,
      including ISDN, entities. This interworking allows, for example,
      carrying signaling information between ATIS.TR.ETS entities
      without loss of information. One or both of the SIP endpoints
      might be PSTN gateways. The namespace "wps" allows, based on
      policy, to provide priority treatment in processing and allocating
      resources to call or session requests, including air interface,
      labeled with this namespace.
