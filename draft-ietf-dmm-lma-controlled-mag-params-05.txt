            draft-ietf-dmm-lma-controlled-mag-params-05.txt

Abstract

   This specification defines a new extension, LMA-Controlled-MAG-
   Session-Params to Proxy Mobile IPv6.  This option can be used by the
   local mobility anchor in Proxy Mobile IPv6 signaling for notifying
   the mobile access gateway to conform to various configuration
   parameters such as heartbeat parameters and binding refresh
   parameters.

Internet-Draft    LMA Controlled MAG Session Parameters         May 2017


1.  Introduction

   A large Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213] deployment, such as
   residential deployment, can have tens of thousands of mobile access
   gateways (MAG) spread across geographical locations.  While it can be
   operationally challenging to manage such a large number of MAGs, it
   can also be very difficult to ensure configuration consistency across
   all the MAGs if they are not centrally managed.  Configuring
   aggressive values of parameters such as re-registration timeout and
   heartbeat interval can potentially create considerable signaling load
   on the local mobility anchor (LMA).  This document provides a new
   option to enable the LMA to control various parameters on the MAG
   such as the re-registration frequency [RFC5213] and heartbeat
   frequency [RFC5847].  With this option, the configuration of these
   tunable parameters done centrally on the LMA enables Service
   Providers to have better control on the behavior of the MAGs with
   deterministic signaling load on the LMA.


2.  Conventions and Terminology

2.1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.2.  Terminology

   All the terms used in this document are to be interpreted as defined
   in [RFC5213], [RFC5847] and [RFC7563].


3.  Protocol Extension

   The LMA Controlled MAG Parameters (LCMP) option is a mobility header
   option used to exchange information related to the parameters that a
   LMA enforces on a MAG.  The option can be included in Proxy Binding
   Acknowledge (PBA) message only, and there MUST NOT be more than a
   single instance of this mobility option in the PBA message.  This
   mobility option MUST contain one or more LCMP sub-options.  The sub-
   options are defined in Section 3.1.  The LCMP option has an alignment
   requirement of 4n+2 [RFC2460].

4.  Protocol Configuration Variables

4.1.  Local Mobility Anchor - Configuration Variables

   This specification defines the following variables to be configured
   by the system management.  The configured values for these protocol
   variables MUST survive server reboots and service restarts.

   EnableLCMPSubOptReregControl

      This flag indicates the operational state of the Binding Re-
      registration Control sub-option support.  The default value of
      this flag is (0), indicating that support for the Binding Re-
      registration Control sub-option is disabled.

   EnableLCMPSubOptHeartbeatControl

      This flag indicates the operational state of the Heartbeat Control
      sub-option support.  The default value of this flag is (0),
      indicating that support for the Heartbeat Control sub-option is
      disabled.

   The following variables MAY be defined at various granularities such
   as per binding, per cluster of bindings, per peering MAG, per cluster
   of peering MAGs or any other custom grouping.  Regardless of the
   granularity of this configuration, the LMA MUST be able to determine
   the value of these variables for every individual binding.

   LCMPReregistrationStartTime

      This variable is used to set the minimum time interval in number
      of seconds before the expiry of the PMIPv6 binding lifetime when
      the registration refresh process SHOULD be activated.  The default
      value of this variable is 10 units, where each unit is 4 seconds.

Internet-Draft    LMA Controlled MAG Session Parameters         May 2017


   LCMPInitialRetransmissionTime

      This variable is used to set the minimum delay in seconds before
      the first PBU retransmission of the exponential back-off process.
      This variable is same as INITIAL_BINDACK_TIMEOUT mentioned in
      Section 6.9.4 of [RFC5213].  The default value of this variable is
      1 second.

   LCMPMaximumRetransmissionTime

      This variable is used to set the maximum delay in seconds before
      the last PBU retransmission message of the exponential back-off
      process.  This variable is same as MAX_BINDACK_TIMEOUT mentioned
      in Section 6.9.4 of [RFC5213].  The default value of this variable
      is 32 seconds.

   LCMPHeartbeatInterval

      This variable is used to set the time delay in seconds after a
      successful heartbeat exchange (heartbeat request followed by
      response) when the next heartbeat exchange can be triggered.  The
      default value of this variable is 60 seconds.  The time delay
      SHOULD NOT be less than 30 seconds or more than 3600 seconds.  The
      value of this variable MAY be derived from the variable
      HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL defined in Section 5 of [RFC5847] if configured
      on the LMA.

   LCMPHeartbeatRetransmissionDelay

      This variable is used to set the minimum time delay in seconds
      before a heartbeat message is retransmitted.  The value of this
      variable SHOULD be less than LCMPHeartbeatInterval.  The default
      value of this variable is 5 seconds.

   LCMPHeartbeatMaxRetransmissions

      This variable is used to set the maximum number of heartbeat
      retransmissions.  The default value of this variable is 3.  The
      value of this variable MAY be derived from the variable
      MISSING_HEARTBEATS_ALLOWED defined in Section 5 of [RFC5847] if
      configured on the LMA.


5.  Protocol Considerations

   The following considerations apply to the LMA and the MAG.

   For supporting this extension, the conceptual Binding Cache Entry

Internet-Draft    LMA Controlled MAG Session Parameters         May 2017


   data structure maintained by the LMA, described in Section 5.1 of
   [RFC5213] and the conceptual Binding Update List entry data structure
   maintained by the MAG, described in Section 6.1 of [RFC5213], need to
   be extended to store the LCMP option related information elements
   defined below.

   o  LCMPReregistrationStartTime

   o  LCMPInitialRetransmissionTime

   o  LCMPMaximumRetransmissionTime

   o  LCMPHeartbeatInterval

   o  LCMPHeartbeatRetransmissionDelay

   o  LCMPHeartbeatMaxRetransmissions

5.1.  Local Mobility Anchor Considerations

   On receiving a PBU message [RFC5213] from a MAG, the LMA MUST check
   if the variable EnableLCMPSubOptReregControl is configured and set to
   (1).  If yes, and if all of LCMPReregistrationStartTime,
   LCMPInitialRetransmissionTime and LCMPMaximumRetransmissionTime are
   set to NON_ZERO values, then it MUST include Binding Re-registration
   Control Sub-Option in the LCMP mobility option which is in turn
   included in the PBA message.  If the variable
   EnableLCMPSubOptReregControl is configured and set to (1) and if any
   of LCMPReregistrationStartTime, LCMPInitialRetransmissionTime and
   LCMPMaximumRetransmissionTime is set to ZERO value, then the LMA MUST
   report a configuration error and reject the binding request by
   sending a PBA message with status code '128-Reason Unspecified'
   [RFC5213].

   The LMA MUST also check if variable EnableLCMPSubOptHeartbeatControl
   is configured and set to (1).  If yes, and if all of
   LCMPHeartbeatInterval, LCMPHeartbeatRetransmissionDelay and
   LCMPHeartbeatMaxRetransmissions are set to NON_ZERO values, then it
   MUST include Heartbeat Control Sub-Option in the LCMP mobility option
   which is in turn included in the PBA message.  If the variable
   EnableLCMPSubOptHeartbeatControl is set to (1) and if any of
   LCMPHeartbeatInterval, LCMPHeartbeatRetransmissionDelay and
   LCMPHeartbeatMaxRetransmissions is set to ZERO value, then the LMA
   MUST report a configuration error and reject the binding request by
   sending a PBA message with status code '128-Reason Unspecified'
   [RFC5213].

Internet-Draft    LMA Controlled MAG Session Parameters         May 2017


5.2.  Mobile Access Gateway Considerations

   If the PBA message [RFC5213] received from the LMA contains the LCMP
   mobility option and the Binding Re-registration Control Sub-Option,
   then the MAG MUST overwrite the binding re-registration related timer
   parameters configured locally on the MAG with the parameters received
   in Binding Re-registration Control Sub-Option.  If any of the
   parameters in the Binding Re-registration Control Sub-Option is ZERO,
   then the PBA message MUST be ignored and an error message SHOULD be
   logged.

   Similarly, if the LCMP mobility option contains the Heartbeat Control
   Sub-Option, then the MAG MUST overwrite the heartbeat related timer
   parameters configured locally on the MAG with the parameters received
   in the Heartbeat Control Sub-Option.  If any of the parameters in the
   Heartbeat Control Sub-Option except HB-Retransmission-Delay is ZERO,
   then the PBA message MUST be ignored and error message SHOULD be
   logged.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires the following IANA actions in the "Mobile IPv6
   Parameters" registry.

   o  Action 1: This specification defines a new mobility header option,
      "LMA Controlled MAG Parameters".  This mobility option is
      described in Section 3.  The type value (IANA-1) for this option
      needs to be assigned from the same numbering space as allocated
      for the other mobility options, as defined in [RFC6275].

   o  Action 2: This specification defines a new mobility sub-option
      format, the LCMP Parameters sub-option.  The format of this
      mobility sub-option is described in Section 3.1.  This sub-option
      can be carried in the LCMP Parameters option.  The type value for
      this sub-option needs to be managed by IANA, under the registry
      "LMA Controlled MAG Parameters Sub-Option Type Values".  This
      specification reserves the following type values.  Approval of new
      LCMP Parameters sub-option type values are to be made through IANA
      Expert Review.

7.  Security Considerations

   The LCMP Parameters option defined in this specification allows the
   configuration of re-registration and heartbeat frequencies.  This
   option is defined for carrying it in Proxy Binding Update and Proxy
   Binding Acknowledgement messages.  This option is carried like any
   other mobility header option as specified in [RFC5213] and does not
   require any special security considerations.
