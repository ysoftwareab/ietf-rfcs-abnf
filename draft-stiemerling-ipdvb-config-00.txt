Internet-Draft        IPDVB Address Configuration          February 2005


1.  Introduction

   Future IPDVB networks will require a more powerful IP address
   configuration management as currently provided in such networks.
   Current discussions within the IPDVB working group have shown that
   the future usage scenarios and requirements for dynamic configuration
   of IP addressesare not yet clear defined.  This memo identifies the
   problem space for IP address resolution and configuration in IPDVB
   networks.

   The IPDVB working group has defined a new encapsulation scheme to
   transport IP over DVB (MPEG2 based) networks, the so-called
   Ultra-lightweight Encapsulation [1].  This scheme assumes that IP
   addresses have been already mapped to DVB identifiers (NPA, Network
   Point of Attachment) or NPAs have been mapped to IP addresses
   (reverse address resolution) vice versa .  Another issues concerns
   the assignment of IP addresses to DVB receivers.  Whereas today IP
   addresses are statically to those receivers, future deployments may
   require a more flexible IP address assignment as known from today's
   LAN, for instance, via DHCP [3].  Assigning IP addresses dynamically
   opens the space for further auto-configuration of DVB receivers, such
   as DNS server addresses or additional service layer information.

   This memo is a problem statement only and is intended to start
   discussions within the IPDVB working group.  Comments and discussions
   should be sent to the IPDVB's mailing list at ipdvb@erg.abdn.ac.uk

   Section 2 introduces the network configuration for IPDVB networks.
   Section 3 describe two scenarios in detail.  The document concludes
   with Section 4 listing similar areas of interest.

   The terminology used throughout this memo is defined in [2]

2.  Network Configuration Scenarios

   The basic assumption for IPDVB networks with respect to IP address
   receiver configuration and address resolution is the number of
   possible receivers (hosts) within a single IP subnetwork.  It is
   assumed that future IPDVB networks may extend to 1*10E5 receivers but
   also may be limited to 10 or less receivers.  Where the number of
   hosts per sub-network in IPv4 networks, IPv6 networks can logically
   extend to a large number of hosts.  Such an IPv6 IPDVB network could
   comprise easily of 1*10E5 receivers, but the number can even break
   down to only a few hosts, e.g., 10 or smaller.  This possible number
   of hosts should be consider when describing scenarios and later the
   solution.  Figure 1 sketches a typical configuration of DVB receivers
   with an additional uplink, separate from DVB.  This uplink could be,
   but is not limited to, ISDN, DSL, or cellular networks based.




                                        ,-----.
                      DVB uplink       /  DVB  \

                   #                   \       /
              +----*------+             `--.--'
              |  Network  |                |
              |  Provider +-<-+            v DVB downlink
              +-----------+   |            |
                              |      +-----v------+

                                     +------------+




                 Figure 1: Basic configuration scenario

   The uplink from DVB receiver to network provider can be bidirectional
   and not as shown unidirectional only.

   Figure 1 shows a typical scenario of an installation used to replace
   or substitute DSL deployments in areas where DSL cannot be provided,
   for instance.  Figure 2 shows a scenario where the DVB receiver is
   connected via DVB only and the DVB link is used bidirectional.  Such
   a configuration will be used on ships while being on sea and only
   DVB-S is available.

               Figure 2: DVB only configuration scenario

   A scenario common to today's DVB broadcast usage is depicted in
   Figure 3.  DVB receivers are using IP based transmission but receive
   the data via broadcast only.  Such DVB receivers do not have the
   ability to interact with any other entity and can be configured by a
   push mechanism only.

3.  Scenarios

3.1  IP configuration available

   This section considers scenarios where DVB receivers have IP
   addresses already configured and only additional configuration
   information is required.  This configuration of DVB receivers, for
   example, may be either pre-configured by the service provider or be
   configured by users.  Figure 1 shows such a configuration example.
   The DVB receiver will obtain its basic IP address configuration via
   the non DVB uplink (most likely via ISDN and PPP).  This scenario
   requires only additional configuration to be loaded at the DVB
   receivers.  Possible things to configure:
   o  IP service information, such as DNS server, proxies, etc
   o  multicast configuration and routing information
   o  broadcast configuration ("open bitstream" without any
      registration, DVB receivers just receive IP streams)
   o  security configuration, e.g., keys, policies.

3.2  Complete Bootstrap

   Future scenarios may require a complete bootstrap of DVB receivers
   without any pre-configuration available on the IP level.  Those DVB
   receivers may be pre-configured to known a basic DVB configuration,
   such as PID assignment for system information tables (SI tables).
   Such a receiver would need to retrieve first an IP address and learn
   about its IP environment (netmask, IP next hop, ...).  Figure 2 shows
   such a scenario where a DVB receiver (and transmitter) would be
   installed aboard a ship and would function as a gateway between the
   ship's network and the DVB network.

4.  Related Work

   Configuration of DVB, or more general MPEG2 based, networks is
   tackled in several other environments with different prerequisites.
   IP over Cable Data Networks (IPDCN) working group is working in this
   area and is specifying several MIB modules with respect to MPEG2
   network configuration.  DVB itself has defined several mechanism to
   configure receivers, such as system information tables (SI tables),
   or within MHP.

   Configuration of IP hosts is focus of the Network Configuration
   (NETCONF) working group,  Dynamic Host Configuration (DHC) working
   group, and defined in several RFC documents (IPV6 neighbor discovery,
   IPv4 Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)).

5.  Conclusions

   This memo is first attempt to solve the questions on how future IPDVB
   networks can deal with IP address resolution and address
   configuration.  Open questions are:
   o  What are the configuration scenarios?
   o  What exactly should be configured?
   o  How to configure?
   o  Who is in control of the receiver?  The operator is in control of
      the receiver in the case of MHP.  Users running a DVB PC adaptor
      have full control over their receiver and network operators
      running their routers on DVB network a likely not to give away
      control over their equipment.
   During the first discussions at the 61st IETF some differences
   between IPDVB and other network configuration techniques have been
   noted.  The NETCONF approach is made for single router configuration
   and is not intended to configure thousands of host at the same time.
   IPCDN on the other hand considers 1*10e3 hosts per cable head end to
   be configured.  IPDVB must consider up to 1*10e5 hosts per segment,
   see Section 2.  This must be definitely taken into account when
   designing a solution.

   This memo is neither accurate nor complete at this point of time and
   should trigger the discussions within the IPDVB working group.  Feed
   back to this memo is welcome.
