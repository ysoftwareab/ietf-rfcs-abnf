          1.  Status of this Memo

          This draft document will be submitted to the RFC editor as an
          experimental extension to the SNMP MIB.  Distribution of this
          memo is unlimited.  Please send comments to the editors.


          2.  Abstract

          This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
          Information Base (MIB) for use with network management
          protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.  In particular, it
          defines objects for managing DS1 Interface objects.  Note to
          implementors: a companion document describes DS3 Managed
          Objects; implementors looking at this one should also
          reference that.

          This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet
          community.

          3.  Historical Perspective

          As reported in RFC 1052, IAB Recommendations for the
          Development of Internet Network Management Standards [1], a
          two-prong strategy for network management of TCP/IP-based
          internets was undertaken.  In the short-term, the Simple
          Network Management Protocol (SNMP), defined in RFC 1067, was
          to be used to manage nodes in the Internet community.  In the
          long-term, the use of the OSI network management framework was
          to be examined.  Two documents were produced to define the
          management information: RFC 1065, which defined the Structure
          of Management Information (SMI), and RFC 1066, which defined
          the Management Information Base (MIB).  Both of these
          documents were designed so as to be compatible with both the
          SNMP and the OSI network management framework.

          This strategy was quite successful in the short-term:
          Internet-based network management technology was fielded, by
          both the research and commercial communities, within a few
          months.  As a result of this, portions of the Internet
          community became network manageable in a timely fashion.

          As reported in RFC 1109, Report of the Second Ad Hoc Network
          Management Review Group [2], the requirements of the SNMP and
          the OSI network management frameworks were more different than
          anticipated.  As such, the requirement for compatibility
          between the SMI/MIB and both frameworks was suspended.  This
          action permitted the operational network management framework,
          based on the SNMP, to respond to new operational needs in the
          Internet community by producing MIB-II.

          In May of 1990, the core documents were elevated to "Standard
          Protocols" with "Recommended" status.  As such, the Internet-
          standard network management framework consists of: Structure
          and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based
          internets, RFC 1155 [3], which describes how managed objects
          contained in the MIB are defined; Management Information Base
          for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets, which
          describes the managed objects contained in the MIB, RFC 1156
          [4]; and, the Simple Network Management Protocol, RFC 1157
          [5], which defines the protocol used to manage these objects.

          Consistent with the IAB directive to produce simple, workable
          systems in the short-term, the list of managed objects defined
          in the Internet-standard MIB was derived by taking only those

          elements which are considered essential.  However, the SMI
          defined three extensibility mechanisms: one, the addition of
          new standard objects through the definitions of new versions
          of the MIB; two, the addition of widely-available but non-
          standard objects through the experimental subtree; and three,
          the addition of private objects through the enterprises
          subtree.  Such additional objects can not only be used for
          vendor-specific elements, but also for experimentation as
          required to further the knowledge of which other objects are
          essential.

          This memo defines extensions to the MIB using the second
          method.  It contains definitions of managed objects used for
          experimentation.

          4.  Objects

          Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
          termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
          MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation
          One (ASN.1) [7] defined in the SMI.  In particular, each
          object has a name, a syntax, and an encoding.  The name is an
          object identifier, an administratively assigned name, which
          specifies an object type.  The object type together with an
          object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific
          instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we often
          use a textual string, termed the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also
          refer to the object type.

          The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data
          structure corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1
          language is used for this purpose.  However, the SMI [3]
          purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used.
          These restrictions are explicitly made for simplicity.

          The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type
          is represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly
          tied to the notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is
          how the object type is represented when being transmitted on
          the network.

          The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1
          [8], subject to the additional requirements imposed by the
          SNMP.


          4.1.  Format of Definitions

          Section 6 contains contains the specification of all object
          types contained in this MIB module.  The object types are
          defined using the conventions defined in the SMI, as amended
          by the extensions specified in [13, 14].

          Internet Draft      DS1 Interface OBJECTS        November 1990


          5.  Overview

          These objects are used when the particular media being used to
          realize an interface is a DS1 physical interface.  At present,
          this applies to these values of the ifType variable in the
          Internet-standard MIB:

               t1-carrier(18)
               cept(19)

          The definitions contained herein are based on the AT&T T-1
          specifications and Extended Superframe Format (ESF) [9, 10],
          the latter of which conforms to ANSI and proposed
          international specifications [15, 16].  The various T1 and E1
          line disciplines are similar enough that separate MIBs are
          unwarranted, although there are some differences.  For
          example, Loss of Frame is defined more rigorously in the ESF
          specification than in the D4 specification, but it is defined
          in both.


          5.1.  Binding between Interfaces and CSUs

          It should be noted that it is possible to multiplex multiple
          bit streams onto a single DS1 physical interface (CSU),
          realizing multiple interfaces from the perspective of the
          Internet-standard MIB.  It is also possible to concatenate
          physical interfaces to provide a single logical interface.  As
          such, it is important to be able to distinguish between the
          indices used to identify the CSUs attached to a node and the
          indices used to identify an interface (in the MIB sense)
          attached to a node.

          Each agent which resides on a host which uses DS1 physical
          interfaces is required to assign a small, non-negative integer
          uniquely to each CSU.  This is known as the "CSUIndex", and is
          used to distinguish between different CSUs attached to a node.
          The CSUIndex is also used as the `key' when accessing tabular
          information about DS1 physical interfaces.

          The potentially many-to-one binding between CSU indices and
          the ifIndex value assigned to each MIB interface are defined
          in the ds1ConfigTable table defined in the next section.

          5.2.  Objectives of this MIB Module

          There are numerous things that could be included in a MIB for
          DS1 Interfaces: the management of multiplexors, CSUs, DSUs,
          and the like.  The intent of this document is to facilitate
          the common management of CSUs, both in-chassis and external
          via proxy.  As such, a design decision was made up front to
          very closely align the MIB with the set of objects that can
          generally be read from CSUs that are currently deployed, which
          is to say ESF CSUs conforming to AT&T specifications.
          However, by simple generalization of these objects, the MIB is
          also made applicable to D4 and G.704 devices.

          To meet a requirement not easily satisfied in other places,
          There is one additional group present, the Fractional DS1
          group.  This is intended to facilitate the use of fractional
          DS1 devices (ie, devices which utilize a subset of the 8 bit
          channels available in the frame) over the managed CSUs.


          5.3.  DS1 Terminology

          The terminology used in this document to describe error
          conditions on a T1 or E1 circuit monitored by a CSU are from
          the AT&T Technical Reference [11].

          Out of Frame event
               An Out of Frame event is declared when the receiver
               detects two or more framing-bit errors within a 3
               millisecond period, or two or more errors out of five or
               less consecutive framing-bits.  At this time, the framer
               enters the Out of Frame State, and starts searching for a
               correct framing pattern.  The Out of Frame state ends
               when reframe occurs.

          Loss of Signal
               This event is declared upon observing 175 +/- 75
               contiguous pulse positions with no pulses of either
               positive or negative polarity (also called keep alive).

          Code Violation Error Event
               A Code Violation Error Event is the occurrence of a
               received Cyclic Redundancy Check code that is not
               identical to the corresponding locally-calculated code.

          Internet Draft      DS1 Interface OBJECTS        November 1990


          Bipolar Violation
               A Bipolar Violation, for B8ZS-coded signals, is the
               occurrence of a received bipolar violation that is not
               part of a zero-substitution code.  It also includes other
               error patterns such as: eight or more consecutive zeros
               and incorrect parity.

          Errored Seconds
               An Errored Second is a second with one or more Code
               Violation Error Events OR one or more Out of Frame
               events.  In D4 and G.704 section 2.1.3.2 (eg, G.704 which
               does not implement the CRC), the presence of Bipolar
               Violations also triggers an Errored Second.

          Bursty Errored Seconds
               A Bursty Errored Second is a second with more than one
               and less that 320 Code Violation Error Events.  Note that
               this value is not defined if the DS1 Line type is ds1D4
               or ds1G704.

          Severely Errored Seconds
               A Severely Errored Second is a second with 320 or more
               Code Violation Error Events OR one or more Out of Frame
               events.

          Severely Errored Framing Second
               An Severely Errored Framing Second is a second with one
               or more Out of Frame events.

          Unavailable Signal State
               This state is declared at the onset of 10 consecutive
               Severely Errored Seconds.  It is cleared at the onset of
               10 consecutive seconds with no Severely Errored Second.

          Unavailable Seconds
               Unavailable Seconds are calculated by counting the number
               of seconds that the CSU is in the Unavailable Signal
               State, including the initial 10 seconds to enter the
               state but not including the 10 seconds to exit the state.

               Note that any second that may be counted as an
               Unavailable Second may not be counted as an Errored
               Second, a Bursty Errored Second, or a Severely Errored
               Second.  Since the 10 Severely Errored Seconds that
               comprise the transition from the available to Unavailable





          F. Baker and C. Kolb (editors)                        [Page 7]





          Internet Draft      DS1 Interface OBJECTS        November 1990


               Signal State may also be counted as Errored Seconds,
               Bursty Errored Seconds, and Severely Errored Seconds
               previous to entering the state, these three counters are
               adjusted so that any second counted during this
               transition is then subtracted.  The 10 seconds in the
               transition from unavailable to available may be counted
               as Errored Seconds or Bursty Errored Seconds.

               A special case exists when the 10 or more second period
               crosses the 900 second statistics window boundary, as the
               foregoing description implies that the Severely Errored
               Second and Unavailable Second counters must be adjusted
               when the Unavailable Signal State is entered.  Clearly,
               successive GETs of the affected ds1IntervalSES and
               ds1IntervalUAS objects will return differing values if
               the first GET occurs during the first few seconds of the
               window.  This is viewed as an unavoidable side-effect of
               selecting the presently deployed AT&T objects as a basis
               for this memo.

          Yellow Alarm
               A Yellow Alarm is declared because of an incoming Yellow
               Signal from the far-end.  In effect, the circuit is
               declared to be a one way link.

          Red Alarm
               A Red Alarm is declared because of an incoming Loss of
               Signal, Loss of Framing, Alarm Indication Signal.  After
               a Red Alarm is declared, the device sends a Yellow Signal
               to the far-end.  The far-end, when receives the Yellow
               Signal, declares a Yellow Alarm.

          Circuit Identifier
               This is a character string specified by the circuit
               vendor, and is useful when communicating with the vendor
               during the troubleshooting process.

                      "This variable describes the variety of Zero Code
                      Suppression used on the link, which in turn
                      affects a number of its characteristics.

                      ds1JammedBit refers the Jammed bit Zero Encoding,
                      in which the AT&T specification of at least one
                      pulse every 8 bit periods is literally implemented
                      by forcing a pulse in bit 8 of each channel.
                      Thus, only seven bits per channel, or 1.344 Mbps,
                      is available for data.

                      ds1B8ZS refers to the use of a specified pattern
                      of normal bits and bipolar violations which are
                      used to replace a sequence of eight zero bits.  In
                      this context, all eight bits in a channel are
                      technically available for data, but care must be
                      taken with D4 encoded data to avoid having HDLC
                      Flag streams imitate spurious Yellow Alarm
                      conditions.  Typically, one bit per frame is
                      ignored to force flag streams to rotate, thereby
                      avoiding this error type.  CCITT Recommendation
                      G.703 [11] may be referred to for further
                      definition of these.

                      ds1InvertedHDLC refers to the practice, common on
                      HDLC encoded DS1 data links, of inverting the data
                      between the serial interface chip and the CSU.
                      Since HDLC guarantees one zero every 6 bits in the
                      worst case, while the standards call for (in
                      effect) at least one pulse every eight, inverted
                      HDLC enjoys 4/24 one's density on the line, which
                      may improve the effective clock stability of a DS1
                      line.  As with B8ZS, all eight bits in a channel
                      are technically available for data, but care must
                      be taken with D4 encoded data to avoid having HDLC
                      Flag streams imitate spurious Yellow Alarm
                      conditions.  Typically, one bit per frame is
                      ignored to force flag streams to rotate, thereby
                      avoiding this error type.

          -- the DS1 Fractional group

          -- Implementation of this group is mandatory for those
          -- systems utilizing a fractional DS1 capability


          -- The DS1 fractional table contains identifies which DS1
          -- channels associated with a CSU are being used to support a
          -- logical interface, i.e., an entry in the interfaces table
          -- from the Internet-standard MIB.  For Clear Channel
          -- implementations, exactly one ifTable entry corresponds to
          -- the CSU being managed.  In this very typical case, the
          -- variable ds1Index indicates the value of ifIndex which
          -- corresponds to the interface being supported by a
          -- particular CSU.

          -- However, for fractional DS1 implementations, the
          -- correspondent value of ds1Index is 0, and for each DS1
          -- channel supporting a logical interface, there is an entry
          -- in the DS1 fractional table which names a value for
          -- ifIndex.
          --
          --      For ds1ESF, ds1D4, and ds1ANSI-ESF, there are 24 legal
          --      channels, numbered 1 through 24.
          --
          --      For G.704, there are 32 legal channels, numbered 1
          --      through 32.  ds1G704 can carry user data in channels 2
          --      through 32, channel 1 being an overhead channel.
          --      ds1G704-CRC can carry user data in channels 2 through
          --      16 and 18 through 32, channels 1 and 17 being overhead
          --      channels.
