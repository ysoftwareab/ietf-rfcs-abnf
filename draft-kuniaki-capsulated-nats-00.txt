1. Abstract

   Networks which are using IPv4 addresses are using the address
   translation technologies such as NAT[1] at end-networks for
   various reasons. However, those technologies sometimes prevent
   two-way transparently communications.
   This document will define a way to enhance address translation
   technologies such as NAT. This way will be able to communicate
   transparently by adding a sub-address to IPv4.
   This enhancement will be called 'C-NATS'(Capsulated Network Address
   Translation with Sub-Address). However, 'C-NATS' will be call 'NATS'
   in this document.

2. Overview

  This enhancement has the following three advantages:

    a) There is NO-IMPACT for high hierarchy network routing (such as
       backbones).
    b) The use of NATS is limited to use for end-networks which are
       usually connected by NAT router.
    c) The use of NATS will be easier to implement for a router and a
       host.

  Implementation of the NATS needs minor changes for application
  software and network equipments including dial-up routers which are
  connected to end-networks. Therefore, this enhancement does not
  adversely affect backbone networks such as a high-bandwidth network.

  This enhancement adds 16 bits of sub-address space for each IPv4
  address. This document defines a new transport protocol for that this
  protocol will be used in generic IPv4 network.

  This transport protocol consists of 8 octets NATS control fields and
  transport data fields which is used usual IPv4 packets.

  When a host or a router which do not support the NATS receive a NATS
  supported packet, these packets will be ignored without supporting the
  NATS. In this way, when the NATS is implemented, the NATS supported
  equipments maintains interoperability with the NATS non-supported
  equipments.

  1: Sub-Address Discovery

     This type is used for resolving sub-address from a network.

     - In case of resolving for IP Address from sub-address.

       1. Sub-Address is in SA field. IP Address field is 0.0.0.0.
          And, this packet send to network by broadcast.
       2. When the host receive a packet which is specified its
          sub-address, the host send a packet to source host.
          The IP Address field of the packet is local IP address.

     - In case of resolving for Sub-Address from IP address.

       1. USA is in the SA field. IP address field is IP address of
          the destination host. And, this packet send to destination
          host by unicast.
       2. When the host receive a packet, the host return a packet
          to source host. The SA field of the packet is local
          Sub-Address.

     Expire time for this request is optional. However, this time may
     set 30seconds for default.

     Following is encoding of this request:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


  2. Sub-Address Registration

     This message is used for that a NATS supported host notifies local
     sub-address to a NATS router, or a NATS router assigns a
     sub-address for a NATS supported host. The NATS router can know
     that the host supports NATS protocol using this message.

     Reg. type 0 is registration, 1 is deletion.
     When the host notifies that the host supports NATS, the host send
     Reg. Type 0(Add) using this message. If the host doesn't know the
     local sub-address, then the host specifies USA in the SA field.
     At this time, the NATS router assigns a sub-address to the host,
     and the host returns Reg.type 3(Assignment). The SA field of this
     message is a assigned sub-address.

     When the host is done shutdown or it is in similar situation, the
     host should send a message of Reg.type 1(Delete), and the host
     should release sub-address. Expire time of this message is 0(Zero).

     When the SA filed is not USA, expire time have must be set. When
     the expire time is 0(Zero), it means that expire time is 1800 for
     default. Expire time field describes 'seconds'.

            1: Delete
            2: Assignment
            3: Expired

      A host or a router must manage valid time for sub-address using
      expire time. When expire time arrived, the host should notify that
      current sub-address is expired using Reg.Type 3(Expired).
      The equipments which are received this message can request to
      continue for using current sub-address using Reg. Type2
      (Assignment).
      If the current sub-address cannot continue for using, then the
      equipment return Reg.Type 2(Assignment). The SA field of this
      message is USA.
      When the equipments reject continuing to use a sub-address, the
      equipment need to request getting a new sub-address using same
      way of first set of assignment of a sub-address.


6. Address Expression

   - Dynamically address expression

     <DSA>!example.com

     <DSA> will be described in decimal.

     For future reference:
       When the host doesn't support the NATS, to resolve the name by
       DNS, FQDN is used "<DSA>!example.com". In this case,
       "<DSA>!example.com" is registered to DNS 'A' record, the host
       can resolve the gateway IPv4 address which is used by the
       destination network. This is not a substantial improvement.
       However, from the making connection by best effort point of view,
       it is important. Therefore, the author suggests that the NATS
       host registers to DNS in this way.

Internet-Draft                                             November 2001


   - By name expression

     Address resolution with the sub-address is done by normal DNS
     resolution. When the host resolve sub-address, it refers to the
     HINFO resource record. The HINFO resource record format is
     following:

       hostname     HINFO     "/SUBA:<Sub-Address>!<IP Address>/" ""

     In this format, from '/SUBA:' to '/' describes the sub-address and
     IP Address. Excepting this format is ignored. This format should be
     identified and placed anywhere in the HINFO resource record.
     Actually, the HINFO resource record has two fields, 'CPU
     Information' and 'OS Information'. This format should be identified
     on either field. When there are two or more sub-address statements,
     the first statement will be identified.

     The host can resolve the sub-address to refer HINFO resource record
     of DNS by hostname.


7. Equipment behavior

7.1 Hosts

  When a host sends a request packet to make connection, if the
  following criterias are matched, then the host has to send a packet
  which is encoded for the NATS.

    1. An application specifies a destination sub-address using the way
       of described in section 6 except that the destination sub-address
       is USA.

    2. An application specifies a destination sub-address using the
       dynamically address expression.

  A host has to reply using NATS encoded packet when the host receives
  a NATS encoded packet to make connection.

  However, if a NATS supported host is not assigned sub-address, then
  the host never send NATS encoded packets.

7.2 Routers

7.2.1 Function of NATS routes

  The NATS router have to keep a sub-address table. It records a pair of
  local IP address and its sub-address.
  When SSA value of a received NATS encoded packet from connected
  network does not match with the sub-address table in the router, the
  router processes the packets as the received packet is correct.

7.2.2 Mechanisms of DNS query hooking by NATS routers

  A NATS router should be implemented mechanism what the router hooks
  DNS queris from local network. The purpose of this mechanism is when
  a NATS non-supported host is connected on local network, a NATS router
  helps that the NATS non-supported host can connect to a NATS supported
  host using NATS protocol.

  This mechanism is described in below.

    1. A NATS supported router should hook DNS queries from local
       network. The host which is connected on local network may be
       configured that DNS is the NATS router ideally. If the host is
       not configured, then the NATS router should also hook DNS query.

    2. When the NATS router receives DNS query to search A RR, its
       query should be hooked and send a query to actual DNS instead of
       the local host. At this time, the NATS router requests to search
       both of A RR and HINFO RR.

    3. If the NATS router can get HINFO RR and IP address and
       sub-address describes in HINFO RR, the NATS router identifies the
       object of the query as the NATS supported host.

    4. If the NATS router identifies the object of the query as the NATS
       supported host by the answer of DNS query, the NATS router
       assigns a virtual IP address which should be configured as NATS
       spool address in NATS router for the object, and store a pair of
       the real IP address, sub-address and virtual IP address.
       Next, the NATS router answers A RR and HINFO RR to local host.
       However, this A RR contains virtual IP address.

Internet-Draft                                             November 2001


    5. A NATS non-supported host will try to connect using virtual IP
       address, when the host communicates with a host which is
       connected global address network. When the NATS router receives
       those packets, it translates virtual IP address into global IP
       address to refer the table which is stored in the NATS router.
       And next, the NATS router sends the translated packet to global
       address network.
       Furthermore, the NATS router has to translate source IP address
       in a return packet from a destination host into the virtual IP
       address.

7.2.3 Behavior of the NATS router

    - When the NATS router receives the NATS encoded packet from the
      WAN interface, it refers to the internal sub-address table and the
      packet will be sent to appropriate host which is placed in the
      local network.
      At this time, if the destination host does not support the NATS,
      then the NATS router has to decode to normal IPv4 packet as to
      delete the NATS header from the received packet.
      The way of judgement whether the destination host supports the
      NATS or not, is done using Sub-Address registration mechanism
      which is described in section 5.
      If the destination host which is defined in the DSA field can not
      found, then the router try to resolve using sub-address discovery
      which is described in section 5.
      After the router sent the "Sub-Address Discovery" packet, it
      should wait a response packet during 15 seconds in default. If the
      router wait a response packet over 15 seconds, then it should send
      an ICMP_UNREACH/ICMP_UNREACH_HOST_UNKNOWN message to the source
      host.

    - When the NATS router receives the normal IPv4 packet from the WAN
      interface, the packet will be sent to a default host. When the
      default host is not configured, the router send
      ICMP_UNREACH/ICMP_UNREACH_HOST_UNKNOWN message to the source host.

    - When the NATS router receives the NATS encoded packet from the
      LAN interface, the packet will be sent to the destination host
      without changing the packet. At this time, the router has to
      change the IPv4 source address to the WAN interface IP address.

    - When the NATS router receives the normal IPv4 packet from the LAN
      interface, the packet will be sent to the destination host without
      changing the packet. At this time, the router has to change the
      IPv4 source address to the WAN interface IP address.
      However, If the NATS router is implemented DNS hook mechanism and
      destination IPv4 address is same as virtual IP address which is
      assigned by the NATS router, the NATS router has to translate
      virtual IP address into global IP address related virtual IP
      address.
      Furthermore, the NATS router has to translate source IP address
      in a return packet from a destination host into the virtual IP
      address.

8. Recommendations of implementation

  This protocol requires to implement to a gateway router between local
  network and global network and a host. However, to implement this
  protocol to those devices are difficult.
  Therefore, this section explains a way of light implementation.

  Firstly, Following devices have to implement NATS.

   1. Gateway routers that are placed between local network as assigned
      private addresses every host and global network as assigned global
      addresses.

   2. Hosts that are placed on global network as assigned global
      addresses.

  Secondly, following functions which is described in this document
  don't have to implement. Those functions is recommended to implement.

   1. Sub-Address Discovery

   2. Sub-Address Registration

9. IANA Considerations

   The Type Field value 0 - 2 are assigned in this document. Type Field
   value 3 - 127 for extended-type are to be assigned by IANA, using the
   "First Come First Served" policy defined in RFC2434. Type values
   128 - 255 for extended types are for vendor-specific types, and
   values in this range are not to be assigned by IANA.
