Abstract 
    
   This draft states the problem of the current generalized multi-
   protocol label switching (GMPLS) routing in order to deal with inter-
   domain TE links for GMPLS inter-domain signaling. Since the GMPLS 
   signaling protocol introduces bi-directional label switched path 
   (LSP) creation mechanism, an ingress node (or a path computation 
   element) searches for the bidirectional route in the traffic 
   engineering database (TED). Considering the GMPLS inter-domain path 
   creation, the TED contains only outgoing TE information of inter-
   domain links and will not be able to confirm the validity of the 
   route.  In order to solve this issue, we describe the GMPLS inter-
   domain routing requirement and mechanism in support of exchanging of 
   inter-domain TE link information.

1. Introduction 
    
   A framework for establishing and controlling Multiprotocol Label 
   Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineered (TE) 
   Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in multi-domain networks has been defined 
   so far [RFC4726], and enabling protocols and mechanisms are 
   intensively investigated [ID-RSVP-TE, ID-PD-PATHCOMP, RFC4655].  
   However, those mainly focus on MPLS inter-domain networks while 
   toughing upon the applicability to GMPLS. Since there are some 
   difference between MPLS and GMPLS, the specific requirements 
   especially for inter-domain LSP creation in GMPLS networks are being 
   proposed [GMPLS-AS]. 
    
   This document states the problem of the current generalized multi-
   protocol label switching (GMPLS) routing in order to deal with inter-
   domain TE links for GMPLS inter-domain signaling. Since the GMPLS 
   signaling protocol introduces bi-directional label switched path 
   (LSP) creation mechanism, an ingress node (or a path computation 
   element) searches for the bidirectional route in the traffic 
   engineering database (TED). Considering the GMPLS inter-domain path 
   creation, the TED contains only outgoing TE information of inter-
   domain links and cannot confirm the validity of the route to the 
   domain boarder node in the adjacent domain. The GMPLS inter-domain 
   routing mechanism must support the information exchange of the 
   routing information with TE extensions of inter-domain links.

   Figure 1 indicates the assumed GMPLS inter-domain network model. Here, 
   we assume a very simple GMPLS inter-domain network model consisting 
   of two GMPLS domains.  Each domain border node is connected by an 
   inter-domain link (IDL). An interior gateway protocol (IGP) with TE 
   extensions such as OSPF-TE or ISIS-TE [RFC4202, RFC4203, RFC4205] is 
   responsible for distributing the routing information with TE. Between 
   domains, an exterior gateway protocol (EGP) such as BGP-4 may be 
   applied to exchange the reachability information and domain-to-domain 
   routes. The ingress node either calculates the path in its own domain 
   or asks the route to a PCE for GMPLS inter-domain signaling. 
    
    
   3.2 Path computation 
    
   Nodes in each GMPLS domain exchange the routing information with TE 
   extensions by the IGP. The IGP will also distribute the routing 
   information of IDL-out within GMPLS domain 1, but not to GMPLS domain 
   2 because of the domain boundary. The domain border node 2 will 
   notify the reachability information of GMPLS domain 2 including 
   itself to the domain border node 1 by GMPLS EGP.  Since GMPLS EGP is 
   currently under investigation in support of TE extensions [GMPLS-AS], 
   the TED of the Ingress node in GMPLS domain 1 does not contain the TE 
   information of the IDL-in Link. 
    
   Consequently, the Ingress node will not calculate the bi-directional 
   route to the domain border node 2 by using the TED, unless the TE 
   information of the IDL-in link are statically and manually configured.  
   Moreover, if a failure occurs over the IDL-in link, the Ingress node 
   may not know it.  Therefore, GMPLS routing mechanism is desired to be 
   in support of exchanging of inter-domain TE link information for 
   GMPLS inter-domain path establishment. 
    
   In the case of MPLS path creation, since the path is uni-directional, 
   the TE information of the IDL-in link will not be required. 
    
    
4. GMPLS inter-domain routing requirements in support of inter-domain TE 
link information 
    
   In order to solve the abovementioned issue, we describe the GMPLS 
   inter-domain routing requirements and a possible mechanism. 
    
   4.1 Inter-domain TE information exchange  
    
   GMPLS inter-domain routing should support to exchange TE information 
   of inter-domain links between domain border nodes in a scalable 
   manner. IGPs with TE extensions do not currently support this 
   function. 
    
   4.2 Inter-domain link TE information distribution 
    
   The exchanged TE information of inter-domain TE links should be 
   redistributed into each domain by using IGP or other methods, and as 
   a result, the TED should be appropriately created so as to contain

   Internet Drafts                                          Feb. 2007 
    
   those of inter-domain TE links. The TED may be synchronized with the 
   database in the PCE. 
    
   4.3 BGP-4 with GMPLS extension 
    
   One of solutions is BGP-4 with GMPLS TE extensions. An early 
   definition of the additional attribute is proposed in [GMPLS-BGP] to 
   support GMPLS TE information, which may be applicable to the 
   mechanism to exchange the TE information of inter-domain links. The 
   exchanged inter-domain link information should be appropriately 
   transferred to the IGP and be redistributed to the domain to create 
   the TED including inter-domain links; otherwise the establishment of 
   interior-BGP sessions may help redistribution of the inter-domain TE 
   link information. 
    
   4.4 Link Management Protocol 
    
   To maintain TE links in GMPLS networks, Link Management Protocol 
   (LMP) has been defined [RFC4204] and applicable to inter-domain TE 
   links as well. LMP provide the functionality to verify the link 
   aliveness and may indirectly assist GMPLS inter-domain routing in 
   support of inter-domain TE links. 
    
    
5. Security consideration 
    
   GMPLS inter-domain routing should be implemented under a certain 
   security consideration such as authentication of signaling and 
   routing on the control plane as well as a data plane itself.  Indeed, 
   this will not change the underlying security issues.
