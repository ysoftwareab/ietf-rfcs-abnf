Abstract 
    
   In any Layer-3 and Layer-2 VPN scheme, the Provider Edge (PE) 
   devices attached to a common VPN must exchange certain information 
   as a prerequisite to establish VPN-specific connectivity. The main 
   purpose of an auto-discovery mechanism is to enable a PE to 
   dynamically discover the set of remote PEs having VPN members in 
   common. The auto-discovery mechanism proceeds by having a PE 
   advertises to other PEs, at a minimum, its own IP address and the

   list of VPN members configured on that PE. Once that information is 
   received the remote PEs will then identify the list of VPN members 
   they have in common with the advertising PE, and use the information 
   carried within the discovery mechanism to either establish layer-2/3 
   VPN connectivity or to learn remote site VPN routes. This draft 
   defines a BGP based auto-discovery mechanism for layer-2 VPN 
   architectures and Virtual router-based layer-3 VPNs. This mechanism 
   is based on the approach used by BGP/MPLS-IP-VPN for distributing 
   VPN routing information within the service provider(s). In the 
   context of L2VPNs, an auto-discovery mechanism enables a PE to 
   determine the set of other PEs having VPN members in common along 
   with information relative to each specific L2VPN endpoints such as 
   attachment circuit identifier, topology information, etc. Each VPN 
   scheme uses the mechanism to automatically discover the information 
   needed by that particular scheme.  
 
 
1. Introduction 
 
 
   In any Layer-2 and Layer-3 VPN scheme, the Provider Edge (PE) 
   devices attached to a common VPN must exchange certain information 
   as a prerequisite to establish VPN-specific connectivity. An auto-
   discovery mechanism allows a PE to dynamically discover the set of 
   remote PEs having VPN members in common. The auto-discovery 
   mechanism proceeds by having a PE advertises to other PEs, at a 
   minimum, its own IP address and the list of VPN members configured 
   on that PE. Once that information is received the remote PEs will 
   then identify the list of VPN members they have in common with the 
   advertising PE, and use the information carried within the discovery 
   mechanism to either establish layer-2/3 VPN connectivity or to learn 
   remote site VPN routes. 
    
   The purpose of this draft is to define a BGP based auto-discovery 
   mechanism for layer-2 VPNs (i.e., [VPLS-BGP], [L2VPN-ROSEN], [VPLS-
   LDP]) and layer-3 VPNs based on Virtual Router (VR) [VPN-VR] 
   solution. This mechanism is based on the approach used by [BGP/MPLS-
   IP-VPN] for distributing VPN routing information within the service 
   provider(s). Each VPN scheme uses the mechanism to automatically 
   discover the information needed by that particular scheme. Layer-2 
   and layer-3 VPN solutions that plan to use BGP-based auto-discovery 
   must comply with the general encoding proposed in this document. 
    
    
   In [BGP/MPLS-IP-VPN], VPN-specific routes are exchanged, along with 
   the information needed to enable a PE to determine which routes 
   belong to which VRFs.  
    
   In VR model, virtual router (VR) addresses must be exchanged, along 
   with the information needed to enable the PEs to determine which VRs 
   are in the same VPN ("membership"), and which of those VRs are to 
   have VPN connectivity ("topology"). Once the VRs are reachable

   through the tunnels, routes ("reachability") are then exchanged by 
   running existing routing protocols per VPN basis.  
    
   In the context of L2VPNs, an auto-discovery mechanism enables a PE 
   to determine the set of other PEs having VPN members in common along 
   with information relative to each specific L2VPN endpoints such as 
   attachment circuit identifier, topology information, etc. 
 
   The BGP-4 multiprotocol extensions are used to carry various 
   information about VPNs for both layer-2 and layer-3 VPN 
   architectures. VPN-specific information associated with the NLRI is 
   encoded either as attributes of the NLRI, or as part of the NLRI 
   itself, or both.   
 
    
2. Provider-Provisioned VPN Reference Model  
    
   Both the layer-2 and layer-3 vpn architectures ([VPLS-BGP],[VPLS-
   LDP], [L2VPN-ROSEN], [VPN-VR], [BGP/MPLS-IP-VPN]) are using a 
   network reference model as illustrated in figure 1.

   It is assumed that the PEs can use BGP to distribute information to 
   each other. This may be via direct IBGP peering, via direct EBGP 
   peering, via multihop BGP peering, through intermediaries such as 
   Route Reflectors, through a chain of intermediate BGP connections, 
   etc. It is assumed also that the PE knows what VPN architecture it 
   is supporting.

3. Carrying VPN information in BGP Multi-Protocol (BGP-MP) Attributes 
 
   The BGP-4 multiprotocol extensions are used to carry various 
   information about VPNs for both layer-2 and layer-3 VPN 
   architectures. VPN-specific information associated with the NLRI is 
   encoded either as attributes of the NLRI, or as part of the NLRI 
   itself, or both.  The addressing information in the NLRI field is 
   ALWAYS within the VPN address space, and therefore MUST be unique 
   within the VPN. The address specified in the BGP next hop attribute, 
   on the other hand, is in the service provider addressing space.  
    
    
    
3.1 Carrying Layer-3 VPN Information in BGP-MP  
    
   This is done as follows.  The NLRI is a VPN-IP address or a labeled 
   VPN-IP address. In the case of the virtual router, the NLRI address 
   prefix is an address of one of the virtual routers configured on the 
   PE. That address is used by the VRs to establish routing adjacencies 
   and tunnel to each other [VPN-VR]. In the case of BGP/MPLS-IP-VPN, 
   the NLRI prefix represents a route to an arbitrary system or set of 
   systems within the VPN. 
    
3.2 Carrying Layer-2 VPN Information in BGP-MP  
    
    
   The NLRI in BGP-MP attribute carries Layer-2 VPN information, 
   which we will refer to as VPN-L2 information.  A VPN-L2 information 
   carried in the NLRI is composed of a quantity beginning with 
   an 8 bytes Route Distinguisher (RD) field and a variable length 
   quantity (see section 5 for specific encodings of this quantity). 
 
   Different layer-2 VPN solutions use the same common AFI, but 
   different SAFI. The AFI indicates that the NLRI is carrying a VPN-L2 
   information, while the SAFI indicates solution-specific semantics 
   and syntax of the VPN-l2 address that goes after the RD. The RD must 
   be chosen so as it ensures that each NLRI is globally unique (i.e., 
   the same NLRI does not appear in two VPNs).  
    
 
   BGP Route target extended community is used to constrain route 
   distribution between PEs. The BGP Next hop carries the service 
   provider tunnel endpoint address. 
    
   This draft doesn't preclude the use of additional extended 
   communities for encoding specific l2vpn parameters. 
 
    
4. Interpretation of VPN Information in Layer-3 VPNs 
    
4.1 Interpretation of VPN Information in the BGP/MPLS-IP-VPN Model

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-l3vpn-bgpvpn-auto-06.txt      June 2005 
 
   For details see [BGP/MPLS-IP-VPN]. 
    
4.2 Interpretation of VPN Information in the VR Model 
    
4.2.1 Membership Discovery 
    
   The VPN-ID format as defined in [RFC-2685] is used to identify a 
   VPN. All virtual routers that are members of a specific VPN share 
   the same VPN-ID. A VPN-ID is carried in the NLRI to make addresses 
   of VRs globally unique. Making these addresses globally unique is 
   necessary if one uses BGP for VRs' auto-discovery. 
 
    
4.2.1.1 Encoding of the VPN-ID in the NLRI 
    
   For the virtual router model, the VPN-ID is carried within the route 
   distinguisher (RD) field. In order to hold the 7-bytes VPN-ID, the 
   first byte of RD type field is used to indicate the existence of the 
   VPN-ID format. A value of 0x80 in the first byte of RD's type field 
   indicates that the RD field is carrying the VPN-ID format. In this 
   case, the type field range 0x8000-0x80ff will be reserved for the 
   virtual router case. 
    
    
4.2.1.2 VPN-ID Extended Community 
    
   A new extended community is used to carry the VPN-ID format. This 
   attribute is transitive across the Autonomous system boundary. The 
   type field of the VPN-ID extended community is of regular type to be 
   assigned by IANA [BGP-COMM]. The remaining 7 bytes hold the VPN-ID 
   value field as per [RFC-2685]. The BGP UPDATE message will carry 
   information for a single VPN. It is the VPN-ID Extended Community, 
   or more precisely route filtering based on the Extended Community 
   that allows one VR to find out about other VRs in the same VPN.  
 
 
4.2.2 VPN Topology Information 
    
   A new extended community is used to indicate different VPN topology 
   values. This attribute is transitive across the Autonomous system 
   boundary. The value of the type field for extended type is assigned 
   by IANA. The first two bytes of the value field (of the remaining 6 
   bytes) are reserved. The actual topology values are carried within 
   the remaining four bytes. The following topology values are defined: 
    
         Value    Topology Type 
    
           1          "Hub" 
           2          "Spoke" 
           3          "Mesh" 
    
   Arbitrary values can also be used to allow specific topologies to be 
   constructed.  
 
Ould-Brahim & Rosen & Rekhter       June 2005           [Page 5] 
Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-l3vpn-bgpvpn-auto-06.txt      June 2005 
 
    
   In a hub and spoke topology, spoke VRs (i.e., PE having VRs as 
   spokes within the VPN)  will advertise their BGP information with 
   VPN topology extended community with value of "2". Spoke VRs will 
   only be allowed to connect to hub VRs and therefore spoke VR-based 
   PEs will just import VPN information from BGP that is set of "1". 
   Hub sites can connect to both hub and spoke sites (i.e., Hub VRs can 
   import VPN topology of both values "1", "2", or "3". In a mesh 
   topology, mesh sites connect to each other, each VR will advertise 
   VPN topology information of "3".  
    
   Furthermore, in the presence of both hub and spoke and mesh 
   topologies within the same VPN, mesh sites can as well connect to 
   hub sites and vice versa. 
 
 
5. Interpretation of VPN Information in VPLS 
    
   The interpretation of the VPN information for VPLS solutions is 
   described in the following sections. 
    
 
    
5.1 VPLS 
    
      In order to use BGP-based auto-discovery for VPLS-based VPNs 
      where discovery and signaling are separate components such as 
      [VPLS-LDP] solutions each VSI needs to have an identifier, which 
      can be encoded as a BGP NLRI. This identifier MUST be unique 
      across all VPLSs, and MAY be unique across all VSIs (in all 
      VPLSs). This document uses Route Distinguishers (RDs) to construct 
      such identifiers. If several VSIs of a given VPLS use the same 
      RD, then the unique identifier could be constructed by prepending 
      the RD to an IP address of the PE containing the virtual LAN 
      switch (VSI).  Note that it is not strictly necessary for all 
      the VSIs in the same VPLS to have the same RD, all that is really 
      necessary is that the NLRI uniquely identify a virtual LAN switch. 
      If all VSIs have their own unique RDs, then these RDs alone could 
      be used as VSIs' identifiers. Any method of constructing unique 
      RDs (e.g., using the encoding techniques of [BGP/MPLS-IP-VPN]) 
      will do. 
  
      Each VSI needs to be associated with one or more Route Target 
      (RT) Extended Communities.  These control the distribution of 
      the NLRI, and hence will control the formation of the overlay 
      topology of pseudowires that constitutes a particular VPLS.  Any 
      method of constructing unique RTs (e.g., using the encoding 
      techniques of [BGP/MPLS-IP-VPN]) will do. 
    
      Auto-discovery proceeds by having each PE distribute, via BGP,    
      the NLRI for each of its VSIs, with itself as the BGP next hop, 
      and with the appropriate RT for each such NLRI.  Typically, each 

 
Ould-Brahim & Rosen & Rekhter       June 2005           [Page 6] 
Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-l3vpn-bgpvpn-auto-06.txt      June 2005 
 
      PE would be a client of a small set of BGP route reflectors, 
      which would redistribute this information to the other clients.  
       
       If a PE has a VSI with a particular RT, it can then receive all 
      the NLRI which have that same RT, and from the BGP next hop 
      attribute of these NLRI will learn the IP addresses of the other 
      PE routers which have VSIs with the same RT.    
     
      If a particular VPLS is meant to be a single fully connected 
      LAN, all its VSIs will have the same RT. If a particular VPLS 
      consists of multiple VLANs, each VLAN must have its own unique 
      RT.  A VSI can be placed in multiple VLANS (or even in multiple 
      VPLSs) by assigning it multiple RTs. 
    
 
 
5.1.1 VPLS using BGP as a signaling Mechanism 
 
   The interpretation of VPN information for VPLS services using BGP as 
   the signaling component is described in [VPLS-BGP]. Note that this 
   solution complies with procedures described in section 3.2.  
 
 
6. Tunnel Discovery 
    
   Layer-3 VPNs and Layer-2 VPNs must be implemented through some form 
   of tunneling mechanism, where the packet formats and/or the 
   addressing used within the VPN can be unrelated to that used to 
   route the tunneled packets across the backbone. There are numerous 
   tunneling mechanisms that can be used by a network based VPN (e.g., 
   IP/IP [RFC-2003], GRE tunnels [RFC-1701], IPSec [RFC-2401], and MPLS 
   tunnels [RFC-3031]). Each of these tunnels allows for opaque 
   transport of frames as packet payload across the backbone, with 
   forwarding disjoint from the address fields of the encapsulated 
   packets. A provider edge router may terminate multiple type of 
   tunnels and forward packets between these tunnels and other network 
   interfaces in different ways. 
    
   BGP can be used to carry tunnel endpoint addresses between edge 
   routers.  
 
    
   The BGP next hop will carry the service provider tunnel endpoint 
   address. As an example, if IPSec is used as tunneling mechanism, the 
   IPSec tunnel remote address will be discovered through BGP, and the 
   actual tunnel establishment is achieved through IPSec signaling 
   protocol.  
    
   When MPLS tunneling is used, the label carried in the NLRI field is 
   associated with an address of a VR, where the address is carried in 
   the NLRI and is encoded as a VPN-IP address. 
    

 
Ould-Brahim & Rosen & Rekhter       June 2005           [Page 7] 
Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-l3vpn-bgpvpn-auto-06.txt      June 2005 
 
   The auto-discovery mechanism should convey minimum information for 
   the tunnels to be setup. The means of distributing multiplexors must 
   be defined either via some sort of tunnel-protocol-specific signaling 
   mechanism, or via additional information carried by the   
   auto-discovery protocol. That information may or may not be  
   used directly within the specific signaling protocol. On one end of 
   the spectrum, the combination of IP address (such as BGP next hop and 
   IP address carried within the NLRI) and the label and/or VPN-ID 
   provides sufficient information for a PE to setup per VPN tunnels or 
   shared tunnels per set of VPNs. On another end of the spectrum 
   additional specific tunnel related information can be carried within 
   the discovery process if needed. 
 
 
 
7. Scalability Considerations 
    
   In this section, we briefly summarize the main characteristics of 
   our model with respect to scalability. 
    
   Recall that the Service Provider network consists of (a) PE routers, 
   (b) BGP Route Reflectors, (c) P routers (which are neither PE 
   routers nor Route Reflectors), and, in the case of multi-provider 
   VPNs, (d) ASBRs. 
    
   A PE router, unless it is a Route Reflector should not retain 
   VPN-related information unless it has at least one VPN with an 
   Import Target identical to one of the VPN-related information Route 
   Target attributes.  Inbound filtering should be used to cause such 
   information to be discarded.  If a new Import Target is later added 
   to one of the PE's VPNs (a "VPN Join" operation), it must then 
   acquire the VPN-related information it may previously have 
   discarded. 
    
   This can be done using the refresh mechanism described in [BGP-
   RFSH]. 
    
   The outbound route filtering mechanism of [BGP-ORF], [BGP-CONS] can 
   also be used to advantage to make the filtering more dynamic. 
    
   Similarly, if a particular Import Target is no longer present in 
   any of a PE's VPNs (as a result of one or more "VPN Prune" 
   operations), the PE may discard all VPN-related information which, 
   as a result, no longer have any of the PE's VPN's Import Targets as 
   one of their Route Target Attributes. 
    
   Note that VPN Join and Prune operations are non-disruptive, and do 
   not require any BGP connections to be brought down, as long as the 
   refresh mechanism of [BGP-RFSH] is used. 
    
   As a result of these distribution rules, no one PE ever needs to 
   maintain all routes for all VPNs; this is an important scalability 
   consideration.

   Route reflectors can be partitioned among VPNs so that each 
   partition carries routes for only a subset of the VPNs supported by 
   the Service Provider. Thus no single route reflector is required to 
   maintain VPN-related information for all VPNs. 
    
   For inter-provider VPNs, if multi-hop EBGP is used, then the ASBRs 
   need not maintain and distribute VPN-related information at all. 
    
   P routers do not maintain any VPN-related information.  In order 
   to properly forward VPN traffic, the P routers need only maintain 
   routes to the PE routers and the ASBRs.  
    
   As a result, no single component within the Service Provider network 
   has to maintain all the VPN-related information for all the VPNs. 
   So the total capacity of the network to support increasing numbers 
   of VPNs is not limited by the capacity of any individual component. 
    
   An important consideration to remember is that one may have any 
   number of INDEPENDENT BGP systems carrying VPN-related information. 
   This is unlike the case of the Internet, where the Internet BGP 
   system must carry all the Internet routes. Thus one significant 
   (but perhaps subtle) distinction between the use of BGP for the 
   Internet routing and the use of BGP for distributing VPN-related 
   information, as described in this document is that the former is not 
   amenable to partition, while the latter is. 
 
    
8. Security Considerations 
    
    
   This document describes a BGP-based auto-discovery mechanism which 
   enables a PE router that attaches to a particular VPN to discover 
   the set of other PE routers that attach to the same VPN.  Each PE 
   router that is attached to a given VPN uses BGP to advertise that 
   fact. Other PE routers which attach to the same VPN receive these 
   BGP advertisements. This allows that set of PE routers to discover 
   each other. Note that a PE will not always receive these 
   advertisements directly from the remote PEs; the advertisements may 
   be received from "intermediate" BGP speakers. 
    
   It is of critical importance that a particular PE should not be 
   "discovered" to be attached to a particular VPN unless that PE 
   really is attached to that VPN, and indeed is properly authorized to 
   be attached to that VPN.  If any arbitrary node on the Internet 
   could start sending these BGP advertisements, and if those 
   advertisements were able to reach the PE routers, and if the PE 
   routers accepted those advertisements, then anyone could add any 
   site to any VPN.  Thus the auto-discovery procedures described here 
   presuppose that a particular PE trusts its BGP peers to be who they 
   appear to be, and further that it can trusts those peers to be 
   properly securing their local attachments.  (That is, a PE must 

 
Ould-Brahim & Rosen & Rekhter       June 2005           [Page 9] 
Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-l3vpn-bgpvpn-auto-06.txt      June 2005 
 
   trust that its peers are attached to, and are authorized to be 
   attached to, the VPNs to which they claim to be attached.). 
    
   If a particular remote PE is a BGP peer of the local PE, then the 
   BGP authentication procedures of RFC 2385 can be used to ensure that 
   the remote PE is who it claims to be, i.e., that it is a PE that is 
   trusted. 
    
   If a particular remote PE is not a BGP peer of the local PE, then 
   the information it is advertising is being distributed to the local 
   PE through a chain of BGP speakers.  The local PE must trust that 
   its peers only accept information from peers that they trust in 
   turn, and this trust relation must be transitive.  BGP does not 
   provide a way to determine that any particular piece of received 
   information originated from a BGP speaker that was authorized to 
   advertise that particular piece of information.  Hence the 
   procedures of this document should be used only in environments 
   where adequate trust relationships exist among the BGP speakers. 
    
   Some of the VPN schemes which may use the procedures of this 
   document can be made robust to failures of these trust 
   relationships.  That is, it may be possible to keep the VPNs secure 
   even if the auto-discovery procedures are not secure.  For example, 
   a VPN based on the VR model can use IPsec tunnels for transmitting 
   data and routing control packets between PE routers.  An 
   illegitimate PE router which is discovered via BGP will not have the 
   shared secret which makes it possible to set up the IPsec tunnel, 
   and so will not be able to join the VPN.  Similarly, [IP-GRE] 
   describes procedures for using IPsec tunnels to secure VPNs based on 
   the BGP/MPLS-IP-VPN model.  The details for using IPsec to secure a 
   particular sort of VPN depend on that sort of VPN and so are out of 
   scope of the current document. 
    
    
9. IANA Considerations 
  
 
9.1 IANA Considerations for L2VPNs 
 
   New AFI value to be assigned by IANA to indicate that the NLRI is  
   carrying VPN-L2 information as described in section 3.2. 
 
    
   New SAFI number for VPLS-based L2VPNs solutions using LDP-based     
   signalling. 
 
9.2 IANA Considerations for VR-based L3VPNs 
 
    
    SAFI number "129" for indicating that the NLRI is carrying  
    information for VR-based solution. 
 
    SAFI number "140" for indicating that the NLRI is carrying

    information for VR for non-labeled prefixes. 
  
    New Extended Community to be assigned by IANA and used for Topology 
    values for VR-based L3VPN solution see section 4.2.2. 
     
    New Extended Community to be assigned by IANA for carrying VPN-ID  
    format based on RFC2685 format (see section 4.2.1.2) 
 
10. Use of BGP Capability Advertisement 
 
   A BGP speaker that uses VPN information as described in this 
   document with multiprotocol extensions should use the Capability 
   Advertisement procedures [RFC-3392] to determine whether the speaker 
   could use Multiprotocol Extensions with a particular peer.

14. Annex: Auto-Discovery in VR and MPLS-IP-VPN Interworking Scenarios 
 
   Two interwoking scenarios are considered when the network is using 
   both virtual routers and BGP/MPLS-IP-VPN. The first scenario is a 
   CE-PE relationship between a PE (implementing BGP/MPLS-IP-VPN), and 
   a VR appearing as a CE to the PE. The connection between the VR, and 
   the PE can be either direct connectivity, or through a tunnel (e.g., 
   IPSec).  
    
   The second scenario is when a PE is implementing both architectures. 
   In this particular case, a single BGP session configured on the 
   service provider network can be used to advertise either BGP/MPLS-

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-l3vpn-bgpvpn-auto-06.txt      June 2005 
 
   IP-VPN VPN information or the virtual router related VPN 
   information. From the VR and the BGP/MPLS-IP-VPN point of view there 
   is complete separation from data path and addressing schemes. 
   However the PE's interfaces are shared between both architectures. 
    
   A PE implementing only BGP/MPLS-IP-VPN will not import routes from a 
   BGP UPDATE message containing the VPN-ID extended community. On the 
   other hand, a PE implementing the virtual router architecture will 
   not import routes from a BGP UPDATE message containing the route 
   target extended community attribute. 
    
   The granularity at which the information is either BGP/MPLS-IP-VPN 
   related or VR-related is per BGP UPDATE message. Different SAFI 
   numbers are used to indicate that the message carried in BGP 
   multiprotocol extension attributes is to be handled by the VR or 
   BGP/MPLS-IP-VPN architectures. SAFI number of 128 is used for 
   BGP/MPLS-IP-VPN related format. A value of 129 for the SAFI number is 
   for the virtual router (where the NLRI are carrying a labeled 
   prefixes), and a SAFI value of 140 is for non labeled addresses.
