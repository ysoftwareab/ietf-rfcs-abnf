1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

2.  Background

   Operating systems, processes and applications, collectively termed
   "facilities" in the following, generate messages indicating their own
   status or the occurrence of events.  These messages are handled by
   what has come to be known as the syslog application[RFC5424].  A
   syslog application sends and/or receives syslog messages.  The reader
   is referred to [RFC5424] for a description of the various roles of a
   syslog application viz. "sender", "receiver" and "relay".  The
   discussion in this document in general applies to a generic syslog
   application.  For special cases the specific role of the syslog
   application will be mentioned.

Internet-Draft                  syslogMIB                   October 2015


   This document defines a set of managed objects (MOs) that can be used
   to monitor a group of syslog applications.

   The SYSLOG-MIB can be used in conjunction with other MIB modules - in
   particular the Host Resources MIB[RFC2790].  The generic process
   related matters e.g. control and monitoring for status, resource
   usage etc. can be serviced by the corresponding entries in the Host
   Resources MIB.

                            +------+
       Syslog message ----->| App1 |
                            +------+

                            +------+
       Syslog message ----->| App2 |------> Syslog message
                            +------+

                            +------+
                            | App3 |------> Syslog message
                            +------+


                     App1: Syslog collector (syslog receiver)
                     App2: Syslog relay (syslog receiver, syslog sender)
                     App3: Syslog originator (syslog sender)

          Figure 1: Syslog applications modeled by the SYSLOG-MIB

   The syslog applications modeled by the SYSLOG-MIB are shown in Fig.1.
   A syslog receiver receives syslog messages.  A syslog sender sends
   syslog messages to other syslog applications.  A syslog relay
   forwards some of the received syslog messages to other syslog
   applications.  A syslog receiver receives a syslog message and
   processes it.  The processing will depend on the internal
   configuration and may involve relaying the message to one or more
   syslog applications.  Note that a syslog application may have
   multiple roles.  Multiple syslog applications may co-exist on the
   same host.

3.  The MIB Design.

   The purpose of the SYSLOG-MIB is to allow the monitoring of a group
   of syslog applications.  This requires managed objects representing
   the following elements.

   o  The configuration and status related details of each syslog
      application.

Internet-Draft                  syslogMIB                   October 2015


   o  The statistics on syslog messages received, processed locally,
      relayed by each syslog application.

   The MIB contains three subtrees.

   o  The syslogNotifications subtree defines the set of notifications
      that will be used to asynchronously report the change of status of
      a syslog application.

   o  The syslogObjects subtree contains four subtrees.

      *  The syslogControlTable subtree deals with the configuration and
         control information for a syslog application.

      *  The syslogOperationsTable subtree deals with operations and
         statistical information about syslog messages sent and/or
         received by a syslog application.

      *  The syslogPriorityTable subtree deals with the relay
         configuration parameters pertaining to a syslog application.

      *  The syslogRelayTable deals with the information about the
         destination of the relayed messages.

   o  The conformance subtree defines the compliance statements.

   The SYSLOG-MIB module uses textual conventions defined in INET-
   ADDRESS-MIB[RFC4001], SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB[RFC3411] and SYSLOG-TC-
   MIB[RFC5427].

5.  Security Considerations

   Syslog plays a very important role in the computer and network
   security of an organization.  SYSLOG-MIB defines several managed
   objects that may be used to monitor, configure and control syslog
   applications.  As such improper manipulation of the objects
   represented by this MIB may lead to an attack on an important
   component of the computer and network security infrastructure.  The
   objects in syslogControlTable, syslogPriorityTable and
   syslogRelayTable may be misconfigured to cause syslog messages to be
   diverted or lost.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  syslogControlTable: The objects in this table describe the
      configuration of the syslog applications.It may be misconfigured
      to start up a very large number of syslog applications (processes)
      and deny the system of its resources.

   o  syslogControlBindAddr: This object may be misconfigured to bind
      syslog application to the wrong address.  This will cause messages
      to be lost.

Internet-Draft                  syslogMIB                   October 2015


   o  syslogControlBindPort : This object may be misconfigured to bind
      syslog application to the wrong service (port).  This will cause
      messages to be lost.

   o  syslogControlMaxMessageSize: This message may be misconfigured to
      set the wrong MaxMessageSize for the syslog application.  It may
      cause syslog messages to be lost.

   o  syslogControlConfFileName: This object may be misconfigured to
      start the syslog application with the wrong (rogue) configuration.

   o  syslogControlStorageType: This object may be misconfigured to set
      the wrong storage type.  That may cause confusion, operational
      errors and/or loss of information.

   o  syslogPriorityTable: The objects in this table link the priority
      value in a syslog message to the entry in the
      syslogRelayTable corresponding to the syslog collector to which
      the syslog message should be relayed.  The table may be
      misconfigured to redirect a syslog message to a potentially non-
      existent wrong destination and/or to redirect a large number of
      messages to a particular syslog collector.

   o  syslogRelayTable: The rows in this table represent the relays to
      which syslog messages will be relayed, depending on the priority
      value in the respective syslog messages.  The table may be
      misconfigured to redirect a syslog message to a potentially non-
      existent wrong destination and/or redirect a large number of
      messages to a particular syslog collector.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  syslogOperationsTable: Objects in this table carry sensitive
      information.  The counters may reveal information about the
      deployment and effectiveness of the relevant security systems.
      The counters may be analyzed to tell whether the security systems
      are able to detect an event or not.

   o  syslogOperationsLastError: This object may contain sensitive
      information e.g. user-id, password etc.  depending on the
      implementation of the syslog application.  It may reveal details
      about the syslog implementation itself, e.g. version, OS etc.

Internet-Draft                  syslogMIB                   October 2015


   o  syslogPriorityTable: Objects in this table carry sensitive
      information.  The objects reveal how the syslog messages are
      grouped, relayed and/or stored.

   o  syslogRelayTable: Objects in this table carry sensitive
      information.  The objects reveal the destination of syslog
      messages.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP application giving access to
   an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access
   to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB modules in this document use the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

      Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
      ----------        -----------------------

      syslogMIB         { mib-2 YYYY }

      IANA Reg.: Please assign a value under the 'mib-2' subtree
                 for the 'syslogMIB' MODULE-IDENTITY  and record
                 the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.

      RFC Ed.: When the above assignments have been made, please
                 - remove the above note
                 - replace "YYYY" here with the assigned values and
                 - remove this note.
