     Providing User Authentication Information to OAuth 2.0 Clients
                    draft-hunt-oauth-v2-user-a4c-02

Abstract

   This specification defines a way for OAuth 2.0 clients to verify the
   identity of the End-User and obtain consent based upon the
   authentication performed by an Authorization Server.  The
   interactions defined by this specification are intentionally
   compatible with the OpenID Connect protocol.

Internet-Draft        OAuth 2.0 User Authentication             May 2014


1.  Introduction

   Section 4.1 of the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework [RFC6749]
   defines the Authorization Code Grant flow which defines a redirect
   flow, typically via a web browser, that enables confidential clients
   to obtain access and refresh tokens.  As part of this flow, resource
   owners are authenticated via the user agent so that their consent may
   be obtained.  This flow defines an Authentication Code Grant
   extension, which enables clients to request authentication of the
   End-User and makes information about the authentication that was
   performed available to the client in a standard format.

   This document extends the OAuth 2.0 authorization request and
   response messages for the Authorization Code flow to also request
   authentication of the End-User and to return information about the
   authentication performed.  The interactions defined by this
   specification are intentionally compatible with the OpenID Connect
   [OpenID.Core] protocol.

   This specification does not define a resource owner profile
   information API.  It is assumed that other APIs such as the SCIM API
   [I-D.ietf-scim-api] or the OpenID Connect [OpenID.Core] UserInfo
   Endpoint could be used for this purpose.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms "Access Token", "Authorization
   Code", "Authorization Endpoint", "Authorization Grant",
   "Authorization Server", "Client", "Client Authentication", "Client
   Identifier", "Client Secret", "Grant Type", "Protected Resource",
   "Redirection URI", "Refresh Token", "Resource Owner", "Resource
   Server", "Response Type", and "Token Endpoint" defined by OAuth 2.0
   [RFC6749], the terms "Claim", "Claim Name", "Claim Value", and "JSON
   Web Token (JWT)" defined by JSON Web Token (JWT)
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-json-web-token], the term "User Agent" defined by RFC
   2616 [RFC2616].

   This specification also defines the following terms:

Internet-Draft        OAuth 2.0 User Authentication             May 2014


   Authentication Request
      OAuth 2.0 Authorization Request using extension parameters and
      scopes defined by this specification to request that the End-User
      be authenticated by the Authorization Server to the Client.

   Authentication Context
      Information that the Relying Party can require before it makes an
      entitlement decision with respect to an authentication response.
      Such context can include, but is not limited to, the actual
      authentication method used or level of assurance such as ISO/IEC
      29115 [ISO29115] entity authentication assurance level.

   Authentication Context Class
      Set of authentication methods or procedures that are considered to
      be equivalent to each other in a particular context.

   Authentication Context Class Reference
      Identifier for an Authentication Context Class.

   Authentication Method
      Specific means by which authentication is performed.  In some
      cases, more than one authentication method may be used for a
      single authentication event.

   Authentication Method Reference
      Identifier for an Authentication Method.

   End-User
      Human participant.

   ID Token
      JSON Web Token (JWT) [I-D.ietf-oauth-json-web-token] that contains
      Claims about the Authentication event.  It MAY contain other
      Claims.

   Issuer
      Entity that issues a set of Claims.


2.  Authenticate Code Grant

   The Authentication Code Grant type is used in exactly the same manner
   as the Authorization Code Grant in Section 4.1 [RFC6749] and has the
   same features and conditions.  This specification extends the
   features available by making it possible for clients to test and
   request authentication and authorization as well as to obtain
   information about the authentication performed via the Authorization
   Code flow.

2.1.  Authentication Request

   In addition to the parameters defined in Section 4.1.1 [RFC6749], the
   following additional parameters are defined:

   prompt
      OPTIONAL.  Space delimited, case sensitive list of ASCII string
      values that specifies whether the Authorization Server prompts the
      End-User for reauthentication and consent.  The defined values
      are:

      none
         The authorization server MUST NOT display any authentication or
         consent user interface pages.  An error is returned if the End-
         User is not already authenticated or the Client does not have
         pre-configured consent for the requested Claims or does not
         fulfill other conditions for processing.  This can be used as a
         method to check for existing authentication and/or consent.

      login
         Regardless of the current user authentication state, the
         Authorization Server SHOULD prompt the End-User for
         reauthentication.  If it cannot prompt the End-User, it MUST
         return an error.

      select_account
         The Authorization Server SHOULD prompt the End-User to select a
         user account.  This allows an End-User who has multiple
         accounts at the Authorization Server to select amongst the
         multiple accounts that they might have current sessions for.
         If it cannot prompt the End-User, it MUST return an error.

   acr_values
      OPTIONAL.  Requested Authentication Context Class Reference
      values.  Space-separated string that specifies the "acr" values
      that the Authorization Server is being requested to use for
      processing this Authentication Request, with the values appearing
      in order of preference.  The Authentication Context Class
      satisfied by the authentication performed is returned as the "acr"
      Claim Value.

   amr_values
      OPTIONAL.  Requested Authentication Method Reference values.
      Space-separated string that specifies the "amr" values that the
      Authorization Server is being requested to use for processing this
      Authentication Request, with the values appearing in order of
      preference.  The Authentication Methods used for the
      authentication performed are returned as the "amr" Claim Value.

Internet-Draft        OAuth 2.0 User Authentication             May 2014


   min_alv
      OPTIONAL.  A value of "1", "2", "3", or "4".  The minimum
      requested authentication assurance level as defined by [ISO29115]
      (see also [NIST_SP-800-63-2]).  The value actually achieved is
      returned as the "alv" claim value, or if no defined authentication
      assurance level is achieved, an "alv" claim SHOULD NOT be
      returned.  When the "min_alv" request parameter is not used, the
      authorization server MAY choose any authentication assurance level
      or use none.

   ui_hint
      OPTIONAL.  A helpful text message that should be displayed to the
      End-User during the authentication process. [[ NOTE: It's not
      clear what the use case for this is or how internationalization of
      the string would be performed. ]]

   For example, the client directs the User Agent to make the following
   HTTP request using TLS (with extra line breaks for display purposes
   only):

     GET /authenticate?
       response_type=code
       &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
       &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.com%2Fcb
       &state=af0ifjsldkj
       &prompt=login
     Host: server.example.com

   The authorization server MUST:

   o  Perform the normal OAuth 2.0 authorization process,

   o  MAY elect not to request consent if no access token is to be
      issued (i.e. this is an authentication only request),

   o  MUST re-authenticate the End-User if "prompt" contains the
      parameter "login",

   o  MUST obtain consent from the End-User if "prompt" contains the
      parameter "consent", and

   o  MUST return an error if "prompt" contains "none" and the End-User
      is not currently authenticated.

2.2.  Authentication Response

   The response is identical to the one described in Section 4.1.2
   [RFC6749].

2.2.1.  Error Responses

   In addition to those defined in Section 4.1.2.1 [RFC6749], an
   additional "error" type is defined.  The error value "login_required"
   MUST be returned after an authentication request parameter "prompt"
   is provided containing value "none" and the End-User is found to be
   currently unauthenticated.

2.3.  Access Token Request

   The access token request is identical to the one described in Section
   4.1.3 [RFC6749].  In cases where there is no associated resource API
   and an access token is not to be issued, the normal OAuth 2.0 token
   request is still made.

2.4.  Access Token Response

   If the access token request is valid and authorized, the
   authorization server issues an access token and optional refresh
   token as described in Section 5.1 [RFC6749] with the exception that
   the issuance of an access token is OPTIONAL.  If the request client
   authentication failed or is invalid, the authorization server returns
   an error response as described in Section 5.2.

   In addition to the parameters described in Section 5, a JSON Web
   Token (JWT) [I-D.ietf-oauth-json-web-token] known as an ID Token is
   returned using the "id_token" parameter containing the following
   claims:

   iss
      REQUIRED.  An identifier representing the issuer of the
      authentication.  This MAY be the authorization endpoint URL.

   sub
      REQUIRED.  An identifier for the authenticated subject.  The same
      identifier MUST be returned for the same authenticated End-User on
      the same Client ID.  The authenticated End-User's "sub" value MAY
      change for different Client ID values.

   aud
      REQUIRED.  Contains the Client ID of the client receiving the
      assertion as an audience value.  Other audience values MAY also be
      present.

Internet-Draft        OAuth 2.0 User Authentication             May 2014


   auth_time
      REQUIRED.  The time at which the End-User was authenticated,
      expressed in number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured
      in UTC until the date/time.  See [RFC3339] for details regarding
      date/times in general and UTC in particular. "auth_time" MAY be a
      time earlier than when the ID Token was issued, as defined by
      "iat".

   iat
      REQUIRED.  The time at which the ID Token was issued, expressed in
      number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC until
      the date/time.  See [RFC3339] for details regarding date/times in
      general and UTC in particular.

   exp
      REQUIRED.  The time at which the ID Token expires, expressed in
      number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC until
      the date/time.  See [RFC3339] for details regarding date/times in
      general and UTC in particular.  Note that "expires_in" refers to
      the access token lifespan whereas "exp" refers to the ID Token
      lifespan.

   acr
      OPTIONAL.  Authentication Context Class Reference.  String
      specifying an Authentication Context Class Reference value that
      identifies the Authentication Context Class that the
      authentication performed satisfied.  The value "0" indicates the
      End-User authentication did not meet the requirements of ISO/IEC
      29115 [ISO29115] level 1.  Authentication using a long-lived
      browser cookie, for instance, is one example where the use of
      "level 0" is appropriate.  An absolute URI or an RFC 6711
      [RFC6711] registered name SHOULD be used as the "acr" value.
      Parties using this claim will need to agree upon the meanings of
      the values used, which may be context-specific.  The "acr" value
      is a case sensitive string.

   amr
      OPTIONAL.  Authentication Methods References.  JSON array of
      strings that are identifiers for Authentication Methods used in
      the authentication.  For instance, values might indicate that both
      password and OTP authentication methods were used.  The definition
      of particular values to be used in the amr Claim is beyond the
      scope of this specification.  Parties using this claim will need
      to agree upon the meanings of the values used, which may be
      context-specific.  The "amr" value is an array of case sensitive
      strings.  The following is a list of defined Authentication Method
      Reference values:

Internet-Draft        OAuth 2.0 User Authentication             May 2014


      pwd
         Password authentication, either by user or service if
         client_secret is used.

      rsa
         If authentication was based on the proof of an rsa key.  This
         includes if authentication was performed by a self-signed JWT
         with a service owned x509 certificate.

      otp
         One time password.

      mfa
         Multiple factor authentication was used.  When this is used the
         other authentication methods will also be included.

      fed
         A federated authentication assertion (e.g.  JWT or SAML) was
         used.

   alv
      OPTIONAL.  The authentication assurance level as described by
      [ISO29115] (see also [NIST_SP-800-63-2]).

   profile
      OPTIONAL.  A URL which can be used to access the authenticated
      subject user profile data.  The URL MUST point to the same user
      profile as the one that was authenticated.  The URL MUST be valid
      for the duration of the associated access token and refresh token
      lifetimes. [[ NOTE: This is data about the user, not about the
      authentication.  Therefore, this should probably be accessed as a
      protected resource using the access token, rather than included as
      a claim here. ]]

   A non-normative example successful response with an ID Token follows
   (with line breaks within lines for readability):

      ZSJ9."
    }

   As per the JWT specification, the encoded ID Token is separated into
   parts by the "." character.  The first part ("eyJhbGciOiJub25lIn0")
   contains the signature algorithm and in this case decodes as:
   {"alg":"none"}

   The claim set is then decoded as:

     {
      "iss":"https://server.example.com",
      "sub":"5dedcc8b-735c-405f-e029f",
      "aud":"s6BhdRkqt3",
      "auth_time":1367956096,
      "iat":1367956098,
      "exp":1368042496,
      "alv":"2",
      "example_extension_parameter":"example_value"
     }

   If the ID Token contains the claim "alv" and its value is higher than
   "2", the ID Token MUST be signed (have a signature "alg" value other
   than "none") and its signature MUST be validated.

   All claims defined above MUST be understood before proceeding.
   Additional claims/parameters that are not understood MAY be ignored.

   The client MUST verify that the "auth_time" value is not future dated
   and "exp" is not a date currently in the past.

3.  Privacy Considerations

   Profile URL values issued in the ID Token and MAY be directed
   identifiers.  In other words, the identifier/URL returned is valid
   only for the "aud" indicated.  This prevents multiple clients and
   non-OAuth clients from being able to gather and correlate information
   about individuals authenticated by the OAuth Authorization Server.


4.  IANA Considerations

   No actions by IANA are requested by this specification.


5.  Security Considerations

   This draft carries the same risk profiles as those outlined in the
   Security Considerations for [RFC6749] and OAuth 2.0 Threat Model
   [RFC6819].
