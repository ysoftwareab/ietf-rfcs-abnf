Status of this Memo 
 
   This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with 
   all provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026 [1].  
    
   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering 
   Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups. Note that 
   other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-

3. Multi-Frequency Tone Generation Package 
    
3.1 Package

   Description: This package defines the basic MF tones as signals and 
   extends the allowed values of parameter t1 of playtone in tonegen.  
   Version: 1 
   Extends: tonegen version 1 
 
3.2 Properties 
   None.

3.3 Events 
    
   None. 
    
3.4 Signals 
    
   Signal Name: MF signal code 0 
   SignalID: mf0 (0x0050)  
   Description: Generate MF signal code 0. The characteristics of the 
   MF signal code, including frequencies and durations, are provisioned 
   on the MG. 
   Signal Type: Brief 
   Duration: Provisioned 
   Additional Parameters: None 
    
   Additional Values: 
    
   mf0 (0x0050) is defined as a toneid for playtone. (0x0050 was chosen 
   arbitrarily). 
    
   The other MF signal codes are specified in exactly the same way. A 
   table with all signal names and signal Ids is included below. Note 
   that each mf signal code is defined as both a signal and a toneid, 
   thus extending the basic tone generation package. Also note that mf 
   signal Ids are different from the names used in a digit map.

4. Multi-Frequency Tone Detection Package 
    
4.1 Package 
    
   PackageID: mfd (To be allocated through IANA) 
   Description: This package defines the events required for basic MF 
   tone detection. This package extends the possible values of tone id 
   in the "start tone detected", "end tone detected" and "long tone 
   detected" events.

4.3 Events 
    
   Event Name: MF signal code 0

   Description: Detect MF signal code 0. The characteristics of the MF 
   signal code, including frequencies and durations, are provisioned on 
   the MG. 
   EventsDescriptor Parameters: None.

   Additional Values: 
    
   The other MF signal codes are specified in exactly the same way. A 
   table with all event names, event Ids and digit map symbols is 
   included below. The event Ids are defined with same names as the 
   signal Ids in package mfg. The additional tone id values are the 
   same tone id values defined in package mfg.
