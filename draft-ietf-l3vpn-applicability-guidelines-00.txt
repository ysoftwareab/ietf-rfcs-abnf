Abstract

   This document plays a role of guidelines to assist development of
   applicability statements for each specific Layer 2 and Layer 3 PPVPN
   approach. It provides a check-list which consists of metrics, each of
   which is intended to clearly point out what must be evaluated and
   written in each approach specific applicability statement document.

   The term Provider Provisioned Virtual Private Network (PPVPN) refers
   to Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for which the service provider
   participates in management and provisioning of the VPN. PPVPNs can be
   classified into various PPVPN types based on their characteristics,
   and requirements for PPVPNs are described in three separate
   documents, [GEN REQTS], [L3 REQTS], and [L2 REQTS]. This document
   extracts metrics directly relating to protocols/mechanisms out of
   provider/service/engineering requirements for PPVPNs described in the
   three requirements documents so as to make approach specific
   applicability statements significant. The extracted metrics in this
   document form a check-list, each of which is intended to clearly
   point out what must be evaluated and written in each approach
   specific applicability statement document. Detailed description with
   regard to the metrics is out of scope of this document.
   Section 2 reviews taxonomy of PPVPN types for which metrics are
   listed in this document. Section 3 provides list and outline of
   metrics. Section 4 is for security considerations, Section 5 is for
   acknowledgement and section 6 is for references.

2. Taxonomy of PPVPNs

   The terminology used in this document is defined in [TERMINOLOGY].

                         Figure. 2.1 PPVPN taxonomy


   The figure above presents taxonomy of PPVPN approaches. Note that
   CE-based Layer 2 PPVPNs may also be further classified as point-to-
   point (P2P) or point-to-multipoint (P2M), and P2M PPVPNs may also be
   further classified as Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) and IP-only
   LAN-like Service (IPLS). Definitions for layer 3 PPVPNs can be
   obtained from [L3 FWK] and definitions for layer 2 PPVPNs can be
   obtained from [L2 FWK].

   This section provides list and outline of metrics generic to L3 and
   L2 PPVPN approaches (in Section 3.1), specific to L3 PPVPN approaches
   (in Section 3.2) and specific to L2 PPVPN approaches (in Section
   3.3). Each L3 PPVPN approach is to be evaluated by using both generic
   and L3 specific metrics. Similarly, each L2 PPVPN approach is to be
   evaluated by using both generic and L2 specific metrics. In this
   document, AS stands for Applicability Statements.
