INTERNET-DRAFT       LDAP: Additional Matching Rules         5 June 2003


Abstract

  This document provides a collection of matching rules for use with the
  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).  As these matching rules
  are simple adaptations of matching rules specified for use with the
  X.500 Directory, most are already in wide use.

1. Background and Intended Use

  This document adapts additional X.500 Directory [X.500] matching rules
  [X.520] for use with the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
  [RFC3377].  Most of these rules are widely used today on the Internet,
  such as in support of the inetOrgPerson [RFC2798] and Policy Core
  Information Model [PCIM] LDAP schemas.  The rules are applicable to
  many other applications.

  This document supersedes the informational matching rules descriptions
  provided in RFC 2798 that are now provided in this document.

  Specifically, section 2 of this document replaces section 9.3.3 of RFC
  2798.

  Schema definitions are provided using LDAP description formats
  [RFC2252].  Definitions provided here are formatted (line wrapped) for
  readability.


2. Matching Rules


2.1. booleanMatch

  The booleanMatch rule compares for equality a asserted Boolean value
  with an attribute value of BOOLEAN syntax.  The rule returns TRUE if
  and only if the values are the same, i.e. both are TRUE or both are
  FALSE.  (Source: X.520)

      ( 2.5.13.13 NAME 'booleanMatch'
        SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.7 )

  The BOOLEAN (1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.7) syntax is described in
  [RFC2252].


2.2. caseExactMatch

  The caseExactMatch rule compares for equality the asserted value with
  an attribute value of DirectoryString syntax.  The rule is identical
  to the caseIgnoreMatch [RFC2252] rule except that case is not ignored.
  (Source: X.520)

      ( 2.5.13.5 NAME 'caseExactMatch'
        SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 )

  The DirectoryString (1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15) syntax is
  described in [RFC2252].


2.3. caseExactOrderingMatch

  The caseExactOrderingMatch rule compares the collation order of the
  asserted string with an attribute value of DirectoryString syntax.
  The rule is identical to the caseIgnoreOrderingMatch [RFC2252] rule
  except that letters are not folded.  (Source: X.520)

      ( 2.5.13.6 NAME 'caseExactOrderingMatch'
        SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 )

INTERNET-DRAFT       LDAP: Additional Matching Rules         5 June 2003


  The DirectoryString (1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15) syntax is
  described in [RFC2252].


2.4. caseExactSubstringsMatch

  The caseExactSubstringsMatch rule determines whether the asserted
  value(s) are substrings of an attribute value of DirectoryString
  syntax.  The rule is identical to the caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
  [RFC2252] rule except that case is not ignored. (Source: X.520)

      ( 2.5.13.7 NAME 'caseExactSubstringsMatch'
        SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.58 )

  The SubstringsAssertion (1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.58) syntax is
  described in [RFC2252].


2.5. caseIgnoreListSubstringsMatch

  The caseIgnoreListSubstringMatch rule compares the asserted substring
  with an attribute value which is a sequence of DirectoryStrings, but
  where the case (upper or lower) is not significant for comparison
  purposes.  The asserted value matches a stored value if and only if
  the asserted value matches the string formed by concatenating the
  strings of the stored value.  This matching is done according to the
  caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch [RFC2252] rule; however, none of the
  initial, any, or final values of the asserted value are considered to
  match a substring of the concatenated string which spans more than one
  of the strings of the stored value.  (Source: X.520)

      ( 2.5.13.12 NAME 'caseIgnoreListSubstringsMatch'
        SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.58 )

  The SubstringsAssertion (1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.58) syntax is
  described in [RFC2252].


2.6. directoryStringFirstComponentMatch

  The directoryStringFirstComponentMatch rule compares for equality the
  asserted DirectoryString value with an attribute value of type
  SEQUENCE whose first component is mandatory and of type
  DirectoryString.  The rule returns TRUE if and only if the attribute
  value has a first component whose value matches the asserted
  DirectoryString using the rules of caseIgnoreMatch [RFC2252].  A value
  of the assertion syntax is derived from a value of the attribute
  syntax by using the value of the first component of the SEQUENCE.

        SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 )

  The DirectoryString (1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15) syntax is
  described in [RFC2252].


2.7. integerOrderingMatch

  The integerOrderingMatch rule compares the ordering of the asserted
  integer with an attribute value of INTEGER syntax.  The rule returns
  True if the attribute value is less than the asserted value. (Source:
  X.520)

      ( 2.5.13.15 NAME 'integerOrderingMatch'
        SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.27 )

  The INTEGER (1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.27) syntax is described in
  [RFC2252].


2.8. keywordMatch

  The keywordMatch rule compares the asserted string with keywords in an
  attribute value of DirectoryString syntax.  The rule returns TRUE if
  and only if the asserted value matches any keyword in the attribute
  value.  The identification of keywords in an attribute value and of
  the exactness of match are both implementation specific.  (Source:
  X.520)

      ( 2.5.13.32 NAME 'keywordMatch'
        SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 )

  The DirectoryString (1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15) syntax is
  described in [RFC2252].


2.9. numericStringOrderingMatch

  The numericStringOrderingMatch rule compares the collation order of
  the asserted string with an attribute value of NumericString syntax.
  The rule is identical to the caseIgnoreOrderingMatch [RFC2252] rule
  except that all space characters are skipped during comparison (case
  is irrelevant as characters are numeric). (Source: X.520)

      ( 2.5.13.9 NAME 'numericStringOrderingMatch'

  The NumericString (1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.36) syntax is described
  in [RFC2252].


2.10. octetStringOrderingMatch

  The octetStringOrderingMatch rule compares the collation order of the
  asserted octet string with an attribute value of OCTET STRING syntax.
  The rule compares octet strings from first octet to last octet, and
  from the most significant bit to the least significant bit within the
  octet. The first occurrence of a different bit determines the ordering
  of the strings.  A zero bit precedes a one bit.  If the strings are
  identical but contain different numbers of octets, the shorter string
  precedes the longer string. (Source: X.520)

      ( 2.5.13.18 NAME 'octetStringOrderingMatch'
        SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.40 )

  The OCTET STRING (1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.40) syntax is described
  in [RFC2252].


2.11. storedPrefixMatch

  The storedPrefixMatch rule determines whether an attribute value,
  whose syntax is DirectoryString is a prefix (i.e. initial substring)
  of the asserted value, without regard to the case (upper or lower) of
  the strings.  The rule returns TRUE if and only if the attribute value
  is an initial substring of the asserted value with corresponding
  characters identical except possibly with regard to case. (Source:
  X.520)

      ( 2.5.13.41 NAME 'storedPrefixMatch'
        SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 )

  Note: This rule can be used, for example, to compare values in the
        Directory which are telephone area codes with a purported value
        which is a telephone number.

  The DirectoryString (1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15) syntax is
  described in [RFC2252].


2.12. wordMatch

  The wordMatch rule compares the asserted string with words in an

  attribute value of DirectoryString syntax.  The rule returns TRUE if
  and only if the asserted word matches any word in the attribute value.
  Individual word matching is as for the caseIgnoreMatch [RFC2252]
  matching rule.  The precise definition of a "word" is implementation
  specific. (Source: X.520)

      ( 2.5.13.32 NAME 'wordMatch'
        SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 )

  The DirectoryString (1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15) syntax is
  described in [RFC2252].

  use of this schema.  Additional considerations are noted above where
  appropriate.
