Internet-Draft                 Metric TLV                     March 2008


Abstract

   This document defines TLVs (type-length-value) structures for
   representing cost values using the generalized MANET packet/message
   format.  A message block TLV structure is defined for representing a
   cost value associated with the local node.  An address block TLV
   structure is defined for representing a cost value associated with
   links or a cost value associated with other nodes.  Both TLV
   structures are defined for use within MANET protocols.

   Registry space is created for TLVs which follow this format.

Internet-Draft                 Metric TLV                     March 2008


1.  Introduction

   The generalized packet/message format [1] specifies a signaling
   format which MANET protocols can employ for exchanging protocol
   information.  This format presents the ability to express and
   associate attributes to packets, messages or addresses, by way of a
   general TLV (type-length-value) mechanism.

   This document specifies a general Metric TLV structure, which can be
   used by any MANET protocols which need to express values associated
   with a cost of using a node or link.  This document does not specify
   how cost values are generated or used.  Differing physical and mac
   layers may have differing cost value generating capabilities and
   differing MANET protocols may have differing consepts and uses for
   sharing cost values.  This document specifies a metric TLV structure
   which can be used to convey cost value information within the
   packetbb framework.

2.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [3].

   Additionally, this document uses terminology from [1], and introduces
   the following terminology:

   Cost Value  - The unit to be conveyed by a metric TLV.

   Node  - A MANET router.

   Link  - A pair of nodes, where at least one node is able to received
      traffic from the other.

   Symmetric Link  - A link in which both nodes are able to received
      traffic from the other with the same link properties.

   Metric  - an number associated with routing cost value as defined in
      Section 5.

   Node Metric  - a metric associated with the cost of using a node.

   Link Metric  - a metric associated with the cost of using a link.

3.  Applicability Statement

   The TLV structures described in this document are applicable whenever
   a metric associated with either a node or a link is required in a
   protocol using the generalized MANET packet/message format [1].  The
   cost value conveyed by the metric SHOULD represent a concept which is
   related to cost of routing.

   Examples of cost value concepts represented by metrics that MAY be
   included in a protocol message are:

   o  The amount of power, normalized to some standard, a node has
      remaining represented as a node metric.

   o  The amount of bandwidth provided by a link represented by a
      symetric link metric.

   o  The estimated quality of a link represented by a inbound or
      outbound link metric.

   The generation of values for transmission within a metric TLV is not
   defined in this document.  The usage of transmitted values by metric
   TLVs is also not defined in this document.  Protocols using this a
   metric TLV as defined by this document MUST: define the concept of
   the value to be transmitted, specify generation of the value, define
   protocol behavior when receiving the specified metric TLV, and
   request an extended type assignment from the appropriate registry
   defined in Section 7.

4.  Protocol Overview and Functioning

   This document outlines mechanisms for encoding cost values using the
   TLV mechanism of [1].  Protocols using the mechanisms and TLVs
   specified in this document must ensure that they do so in a coherent
   way.  This document does not specify a protocol nor does it mandate
   specific node or protocol behavior.

   Node metrics SHOULD represent cost values associated with routing
   though that node.  Node metric TLVs can be either message TLVs, when
   representing a local node cost value, or address block TLVs, when
   representing a cost value associated with a node other than the
   originator.  Multiple node metric values MAY be associated with any
   one address.

   Link metrics SHOULD represent cost values associated with routing
   though links.  Link metric TLVs are contained only in address block
   TLVs.  More than one type of link metric TLV MAY be associated with
   each address.  Link metric TLVs can be either directional or
   directionless.

5.  Metric Representation of Cost Value

   This document specifies a TLV structure in which a cost values of a
   certain type are each represented as metric, one or more of which may
   be used in a TLV's value field.  Each TLV extended type can only
   represent one type of cost, although multiple TLV's of differing
   extended type may be applied to an address or a group of addresses.
   Two different metric representations are defined in this document: a
   linear representation and an exponetial representation.

5.1.  Linear Metric Representation

   Each linear metric MUST consisit of a multiple of 8 bits.  These bits
   are the binary representation, in network byte order, of the cost
   value being transmitted.  The length of the single metric is
   determined by [1], using the TLV semantics bits and the optional TLV
   length field of when present.  For multivalue TLVs the single metric
   value is equal to the single-length value as determined by [1].  The
   linear metric consisting of all zeros SHOULD not be used.  Documents
   which define metrics in which all zero representation is allowed MUST
   state the reasoning and meaning of the all zeros metric.

   The minimum cost value that can be represented in this manner is 1.
   The maximum cost value that can be represented, with N bytes per
   metric, in this manner is 2^(N*8)-1.

5.2.  Exponential Metric Representation

   There are three exponential metric representations permitted by this
   document; an 8 bit representation, a 16 bit representation, a 32 bit
   representation and an 64 bit representation.  Each exponential metric
   MUST consists of either 8, 16, 32 or 64 bits.  The length of the
   single metric is determined by [1], using the TLV semantics bits and
   the optional TLV length field of when present.  For multivalue TLVs
   the single metric value is equal to the single-length value as
   determined by [1].

5.2.1.  8-bit Exponential Metric Representation

   In exponential metrics consistsing of 8 bits, the least significant
   four bits represent the mantissa (a), and the most significant four
   bits represent the exponent (b), so that:

   o  cost value = (1 + a/16) * 2^b

   o  exponential metric = 16 * b + a

   Note that ascending values of the exponential metric represent

   ascending cost values, cost values may thus be compared by comparison
   of exponential metrics.

   An algorithm for computing the exponential metric representing the
   smallest representable cost value not less than the cost value v is:

   1.  find the largest integer b such that v >= 2^b;

   2.  set a = 16 * (t / (2^b) - 1), rounded up to the nearest integer;

   3.  if a == 16 then set b = b + 1 and set a = 0;

   4.  if a and b are in the range 0 and 15 then the required time value
       can be represented by the exponential metric 16 * b + a,
       otherwise it can not.

   The minimum cost value that can be represented in this manner is 1.
   The maximum cost value that can be represented in this manner is
   63488.  Not all integers between minimum-maximum can be expressed
   using this representation.

5.2.2.  16-bit Exponential Metric Representation

   Exponential metric representation using 16-bits uses the half
   precision representation as defined in [5] in network byte order.
   Some restrictions on encoding apply.

   o  The sign bit SHOULD NOT be used.

   o  The reserved exponents 0x00 and 0x1f SHOULD NOT be used.

   o  The zero representation (0x0000) SHOULD not be used.

   o  The infinity representation (0x7c00) SHOULD NOT be used.

   Documents which define metrics in which one or more of the above
   representations is allowed MUST state the reasoning and meaning of
   those representations.

   This minimum cost value that can be represented in this mannor is is
   ~ 6.10 *10^-5 The maximum cost value that can be represented in this
   mannor is 65504.  Not all integers between minimum-maximum can be
   expressed using this representation.

5.2.3.  32-bit Exponential Metric Representation

   Exponential metric representation using 32-bits uses the single
   precision representation as defined in [4] in network byte order.

   Some restrictions on encoding apply.

   o  The sign bit SHOULD NOT be used.

   o  The reserved exponents 0x00 and 0xff SHOULD NOT be used.

   o  The zero representation (0x0000 0000) SHOULD not be used.

   o  The infinity representation (0x7f80 0000) SHOULD NOT be used.

   Documents which define metrics in which one or more of the above
   representations is allowed MUST state the reasoning and meaning of
   those representations.

   This minimum cost value that can be represented in this mannor is ~
   1.175 x 10^-38.  The maximum cost value that can be represented in
   this mannor is ~ 3.403 x 10^38.  Not all integers between minimum-
   maximum can be expressed using this representation.

5.2.4.  64-bit Exponential Metric Representation

   Exponential metric representation using 64-bits uses the double
   precision representation as defined in [4] in network byte order.
   Some restrictions on encoding apply.

   o  The sign bit SHOULD NOT be used.

   o  The reserved exponents 0x000 and 0x7ff SHOULD NOT be used.

   o  The zero representation (0x0000 0000 0000 0000) SHOULD not be
      used.

   o  The infinity representation (0x7ff0 0000 0000 0000) SHOULD NOT be
      used.

   Documents which define metrics in which one or more of the above
   representations is allowed MUST state the reasoning and meaning of
   those representations.

   This minimum cost value that can be represented in this mannor is ~
   1.113 x 10^-308.  The maximum cost value that can be represented in
   this mannor is ~ 1.798 x 10^308.  Not all integers between minimum-
   maximum can be expressed using this representation.

6.  Metric TLVs

   This document defines one message block TLV structure and one address
   block TLV structure.  Both TLV structures defined by this document
   MUST have the thastypeext bit set to 1 in the tlv-semantics field as
   defined in [1] .

6.1.  Message TLV

   A metric message block TLV SHOULD be used for signaling values
   associated with the local node.  If a metric message TLV is to be
   included in a message, the originator-address MUST be included in the
   msg-header-info as defined in [1].

   The <tlv-type-ext> field of a metric message TLV is further defined
   in this document by:

   <tlv-type-ext> = <m-metric-semantics><value-type>

   where:

   <m-metric-semantics> a 1 bit field (exprep) whos bit is described in
   Section 6.1.1

   <m-value-type> a 7 bit field containing the value type of the metric
   being conveyed.

6.1.1.  Message Metric Representation Semantics

   The upper bit (exprep) of the <tlv-type-ext> field in a metric
   message block TLV represents the <m-metric-semantics>.

      Bit 0 (exprep) : If the bit is set the cost value is stored using
      an exponential metric representation as defined in Section 5.2.
      If the bit is unset the cost value is stored using a linear metric
      representation as defined in Section 5.1.

6.2.  Address Block TLV

   A metric address block TLV SHOULD be used for signaling values
   associated with the addresses contained within the address block.

   The <tlv-type-ext> field of a metric address block TLV is further
   defined in this document by:

   <tlv-type-ext> = <ab-metric-semantics><value-type>

   where:

   <ab-metric-semantics> a 3 bit field whos bit is described in
   Section 6.2.5

   <ab-value-type> a 5 bit field containing the value type of the metric
   being conveyed.

6.2.1.  Other Node Metric TLV

   The cost value carried by the metric SHOULD associated with the
   appropriate address conatined in the address block.  This association
   SHOULD NOT convey any information in association with the originator
   address.

6.2.2.  Inbound Link Metric TLV

   The cost value carried by the metric SHOULD be associated with the
   directional link originating from the associated address contained in
   the address block and ending at the originator address.  If an
   inbound link metric is to be used the originator-address MUST be
   included in the msg-header-info as defined in [1].

6.2.3.  Outbound Link Metric TLV

   The cost value carried by the metric SHOULD be associated with the
   directional link originating from the originator address and ending
   at the associated address contained in the address block.  If an
   outbount link metric is to be used the originator-address MUST be
   included in the msg-header-info as defined in [1].

6.2.4.  Symmetric LInk Metric TLV

   The cost value carried by the metric SHOULD be associated with the
   bi-directional link from the associated address contained in the
   address block and the originator address.  If an symmetric link
   metric is to be used the originator-address MUST be included in the
   msg-header-info as defined in [1].

6.2.5.  Address Metric Representation Semantics

   The upper three bits of the <tlv-type-ext> field in a metric address
   block TLV represent the <ab-metric-semantics>.

      Bit 0 (exprep) : If the bit is set the cost value is stored using
      an exponential metric representation as defined in Section 5.2.
      If the bit is unset the cost value is stored using a linear metric
      representation as defined in Section 5.1.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines a structure for a message TLV type and
   structure for an address TLV type, which must be allocated from the
   "Assigned Message TLV Types" and "Assigned Address Block TLV Types"
   repository of [1].

7.1.  Message TLV Types

   This document requests IANA assignment of the "METRIC" message TLV
   type from the "Assigned Messsage TLV Types" of [1] This document
   defines two associated name-spaces for the tlv-type-ext field,
   defined in [1], of the message TLV type "METRIC":
   ietf:manet:metric:msgLin
   ietf:manet:metric:msgExp

   Assignment from these namespaces is as follows:

   assignment is given.  The definition, generation and use of the cost
   value to be conveyed by a new metric MUST be explicitly documented
   before assignment is given.

7.2.  Address TLV Types

   This document requests IANA assignment of the "METRIC" address block
   TLV type from the "Assigned Address Block TLV Types" of [1] This
   document defines eight associated name-spaces for the tlv-type-ext
   field, defined in [1], of the address block TLV type "METRIC":
   ietf:manet:metric:addrBlkLin:Node
   ietf:manet:metric:addrBlkLin:Inbound

                                  Table 3

   A designated expert MUST review and approve any requests for for
   registry values from ietf:manet:metric:addrLin or ietf:manet:metric:
   addrExp name-spaces before assignment is given as defined in [2].
   The definition and use of the cost value to be conveyed by a metric
   MUST be explicitly documented before assignment is given.  The
   generation of the cost values SHOULD also be addressed before
   assignment is given.  Additionally, the associated concept of a value
   which is to be conveyed using an address block metric SHOULD
   corrospond to the correct name-space, ie the address block TLV
   extended type value conforms to the rules layed out in Section 6.2,
   specifically Section 6.2.5.
