               Customer Edge Router Identification Option
                   draft-donley-dhc-cer-id-option-04

Abstract

   Addressing mechanisms supporting DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation in home
   networks such as those described in CableLabs' eRouter specification
   and the HIPnet Internet-Draft require identification of the customer
   edge router (CER) as the demarcation between the customer network and
   the service provider network.  This document reserves a DHCPv6 option
   to identify the CER.

1.  Introduction

   Some addressing mechanisms supporting DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation in
   home networks such as those described in
   [I-D.grundemann-homenet-hipnet] and [EROUTER] require identification
   of the customer edge router as the demarcation between the customer
   network and the service provider network.  For prefix delegation
   purposes, it is desirable for other routers within the home to know
   which device is the CER so that the customer home network only
   requests a single prefix from the ISP DHCPv6 server, and efficiently
   distributes this prefix within the home.  CER-ID is a 128-bit string
   that optionally represents an IPV6 address, or another arbitrary
   number.  The CER-ID maybe treated as a hint to be used with border
   detection methods.  This document reserves a DHCPv6 option to be used
   to identify the CER.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  CER Identification Option

   A Customer Edge Router (CER) sets the CER_ID to the IPv6 address of
   its LAN interface.  If it has more than one LAN IPv6 address, it
   selects one of its LAN or loopback IPv6 addresses to be used in the
   CER_ID.  An ISP server does not respond with the CER_ID or sets the

   CER_ID to ::.  Such a response or lack of response indicates to the
   DHCPv6 client that it is the CER.

   The format of the CER Identification option is:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   Figure 1.

   A DHCPv6 client SHOULD include the CER Identification option code in
   an Option Request option [RFC3315] in its DHCP Solicit messages.

   The DHCPv6 server MAY include the CER Identification option in any
   response it sends to a client that has included the CER
   Identification option code in an Option Request option.  The CER
   Identification option is sent in the main body of the message to
   client, not as a sub-option in, e.g., an IA_NA, IA_TA
   [RFC3315]option.

   When sending the CER Identification option, the DHCPv6 server MUST
   set the CER_ID value to either one of its IPv6 addresses, another
   identifier, or ::. If a device does not receive the CER
   Identification Option or receives a CER ID of :: from the DHCPv6
   server, it MUST include one of its Globally Unique IPv6 addresses
   (unless another identifier is used), in the CER_ID value in response
   to DHCPv6 messages received by its DHCPv6 server that contains the
   CER Identification option code in an Option Request option.  If the
   device has only one LAN interface, it SHOULD use its LAN IPv6 address
   as the CER_ID value.  If the device has more than one LAN interface,
   it SHOULD use the lowest Globally Unique address not assigned to its
   WAN interface.

3.  CER-ID Compatibility

   CER-ID explicitly indicates that a gateway is, or is not, the
   demarcation point between public and private networks by containing a
   reachable IPv6 address, other identifier or a double colon '::'
   (double colon indicates that the CER-ID sender is NOT the edge
   router), and as a compliment, can be applied to various border
   definitions and detection methods such as:

   o  I.D.  Draft-IETF-Homenet-Arch-16 [I-D.ietf-homenet-arch]

   o  I.D.  Draft-Grundemann-homenet-HIPnet-01
      [I-D.grundemann-homenet-hipnet]

   o  I.D.  Draft-IETF-Kline-Homenet-Default-Perimeter-01
      [I-D.kline-default-perimeter]

   o  Others, including manual configuration

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an option code from the "DHCP Option
   Codes" Registry for OPTION_CER_ID.  IANA is also requested to
   maintain a list of authentication options.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security of a home network is an important consideration.  Both
   the HIPNet [I-D.grundemann-homenet-hipnet] and Homenet
   [I-D.ietf-homenet-arch] approaches change the operational model of
   the home network vs. today's IPv4-only paradigm.  Specifically, these
   networks eliminate NAT inside the home network (and only enable it
   for IPv4 at the edge router, if required), support global
   addressability of devices, and thus need to consider firewall and/or
   filter support in various home routers.  As the security profile of
   these home routers can shift based on their position in the network
   (e.g., edge vs. internal), security can be severely compromised if
   routers misidentify their border and mistakenly reduce or eliminate
   firewall rules.  If the CER-ID option is used as part of the border
   detection algorithm, it becomes a natural, but not the only place to
   enact firewall, NAT, Prefix Delegation and other functions in the
   home network.
