1.  Introduction

   Mobile devices such as laptops, smartphones or tablets have different
   requirements than the traditional fixed devices.  These mobile
   devices often change their network attachment.  They are often
   attached to trusted networks, but sometimes they need to be connected
   to untrusted networks where their communications can be eavesdropped,
   filtered or modified.  In these situations, the classical approach is
   to rely on VPN protocols such as DTLS, TLS or IPSec.  These VPN
   protocols provide the encryption and authentication functions to
   protect those mobile clients from malicious behaviors in untrusted
   networks.

   On the other hand, these devices are often multihomed and many expect
   to be able to perform seamless handovers from one access network to
   another without breaking the established VPN sessions.  In some
   situations it can also be beneficial to combine two or more access

   networks together to increase the available host bandwidth.  A
   protocol such as Multipath TCP supports those handovers and allows
   aggregating the bandwidth of different access links.  It could be
   combined with single-path VPN protocols to support both seamless
   handovers and bandwidth aggregation above VPN tunnels.
   Unfortunately, Multipath TCP is not yet deployed on most Internet
   servers and thus few applications would benefit from such a use case.

   The QUIC protocol opens up a new way to find a clean solution to this
   problem.  First, QUIC includes the same encryption and authentication
   techniques as deployed VPN protocols.  Second, QUIC is intended to be
   widely used to support web-based services, making it unlikely to be
   filtered in many networks, in contrast with VPN protocols.  Third,
   the multipath extensions proposed for QUIC enable it to efficiently
   support both seamless handovers and bandwidth aggregation.

   In this document, we explore how (Multipath) QUIC could be used to
   enable multi-homed mobile devices to communicate securely in
   untrusted networks.  Section 3 describes the reference environment of
   this document.  Then, we explore and compare two different designs.
   The first, explained in Section 4, uses the recently proposed
   datagram extension ([I-D.pauly-quic-datagram]) for QUIC to transport
   plain IP packets over a Multipath QUIC connection.  The second,
   explained in Section 5, uses the QUIC streams to transport TCP
   bytestreams over a Multipath QUIC connection.

   Section 6 specifies how a connection is established in this document
   proposal.  Section 7 specifies the format of the messages introduced
   by this document.  Section 8 contains example flows.

   Our starting point for this work is Multipath QUIC that was initially
   proposed in [CoNEXT].  A detailed specification of Multipath QUIC may
   be found in [I-D.deconinck-quic-multipath].  Two implementations of
   different versions of this protocol are available [CoNEXT],
   [SIGCOMM19].

3.  Reference environment

   We consider a multihomed client that is attached to one or several
   access networks.  It establishes a Multipath QUIC connection to a
   concentrator.  This MPQUIC connection is used to carry the UDP and
   TCP packets sent by the client.  Thanks to the security mechanisms
   used by the Multipath QUIC connection, the client data is protected
   against attacks in one or both of the access networks.  The client
   trusts the concentrator.  The concentrator decrypts the QUIC packets
   exchanged over the Multipath QUIC connection and interacts with the
   remote hosts as a VPN concentrator would do.

                       Figure 1: Example environment

   Figure 1 illustrates a client-initiated flow.  We also discuss
   inbound connections in this document in Section 6.

4.  The datagram mode

   Our first mode of operation, called the datagram mode in this
   document, enables the client and the concentrator to exchange raw IP
   packets through the Multipath QUIC connection.  This is done by using
   the recently proposed QUIC datagram extension
   [I-D.pauly-quic-datagram].  In a nutshell, to send an IP packet to a
   remote host, the client simply passes the entire packet as a datagram
   to the Multipath QUIC connection established with the concentrator.
   The IP packet is encoded in a QUIC DATAGRAM frame, then encrypted and
   authenticated in a QUIC packet.  This transmission is subject to
   congestion control, but the datagram that contains the packet is not
   retransmitted in case of losses as specified in
   [I-D.pauly-quic-datagram].  The datagram mode is intended to provide
   a similar service as the one provided by IPSec tunnels or DTLS.

   Figure 2: QUIC packet sent by the client when tunneling a UDP packet

   Figure 2 illustrates how a UDP packet is tunneled using the datagram
   mode.  The main advantage of the datagram mode is that it supports IP
   and any protocol above the network layer.  Any IP packet can be
   transported using the datagram extension over a Multipath QUIC
   connection.  However, this advantage comes with a large per-packet
   overhead since each packet contains both a network and a transport
   header.  All these headers must be transmitted in addition with the
   IP/UDP/QUIC headers of the Multipath QUIC connection.  For TCP
   connections for instance, the per-packet overhead can be large.

5.  The stream mode

   Since QUIC support multiple streams, another possibility to carry the
   data exchanged over TCP connections between the client and the
   concentrator is to transport the bytestream of each TCP connection as
   one of the bidirectional streams of the Multipath QUIC connection.
   For this, we base our approach on the 0-RTT Converter protocol
   [I-D.ietf-tcpm-converters] that was proposed to ease the deployment
   of TCP extensions.  In a nutshell, it is an application proxy that
   converts TCP connections, allowing the use of new TCP extensions
   through an intermediate relay.

   We use a similar approach in our stream mode.  When a client opens a
   stream, it sends at the beginning of the bytestream one or more TLV
   messages indicating the IP address and port number of the remote
   destination of the bytestream.  Their format is detailed in section
   Section 7.1.  Upon reception of such a TLV message, the concentrator
   opens a TCP connection towards the specified destination and connects
   the incoming bytestream of the Multipath QUIC connection to the

   bytestream of the new TCP connection (and similarly in the opposite
   direction).

   Figure 3 summarizes how the new TCP connection is mapped to the QUIC
   stream.  Actions and events of a TCP connection are translated to
   action and events of a QUIC stream, so that a state transition of one
   is translated to the other.

   +-------------------------------+------------+

              Figure 3: TCP connection to QUIC stream mapping

   The QUIC stream-level flow control can be tuned to match the receive
   window size of the corresponding TCP, so that no excessive data needs
   to be buffered.

6.  Connection establishment

   The client MUST establish a connection using the Multipath Extensions
   defined in [I-D.deconinck-quic-multipath].

   During connection establishment, the QUIC tunnel support is indicated
   by setting the ALPN token "qt" in the TLS handshake.  Draft-version
   implementations MAY specify a particular draft version by suffixing
   the token, e.g. "qt-00" refers to the first version of this document.

   The concentrator can control the number of connections bytestreams
   that can be opened initially by setting the initial_max_streams_bidi
   QUIC transport parameter as defined in [I-D.ietf-quic-transport].

Internet-Draft                 QUIC Tunnel                 November 2019


   After the QUIC connection is established, the client can start using
   the datagram or the stream mode.  The client may use PCP [RFC6887] to
   request the concentrator to accept inbound connections on their
   behalf.  After the negotiation of such port mappings, the
   concentrator can start opening bidirectional streams to forward
   inbound connections as well as sending IP packets containing inbound
   UDP connections in QUIC datagrams.

7.  Messages format

   In the following sections, we specify the format of each message
   introduced in this document.  They are encoded as TLVs, i.e. (Type,
   Length, Value) tuples, as illustrated in Figure 4.  All TLV fields
   are encoded in network-byte order.

                        1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |    Type (8)   |   Length (8)  |          [Value (*)]        ...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                     Figure 4: QUIC tunnel TLV Format

   The Type field is encoded as a byte and identifies the type of the
   TLV.  The Length field is encoded as a byte and indicate the length
   of the Value field.  A value of zero indicates that no Value field is
   present.  The Value field is a type-specific value whose length is
   determined by the Length field.

7.1.  QUIC tunnel stream TLVs

   When using the stream mode, a one or more messages are used to
   trigger and confirm the establishment of a connection towards the
   final destination for a given stream.  Those messages are exchanged
   on this given QUIC stream before the TCP connection bytestream.  This
   section describes the format of these messages.

   This document specifies the following QUIC tunnel stream TLVs:

                     Figure 5: QUIC tunnel stream TLVs

   The TCP Connect TLV is used to establish a TCP connection through the
   tunnel towards the final destination.  The TCP Extended Connect TLV
   allows indicating more information in the establishment request.  The
   TCP Connect OK TLV confirms the establishment of this TCP connection.
   The Error TLV is used to indicate any out-of-band error that occurred
   during the TCP connection establishment associated to the QUIC
   stream.  Finally, the End TLV marks the end of the series of TLVs and
   the start of the bytestream on a given QUIC stream.  These TLVs are
   detailed in the following sections.

         Offset 0         Offset 20   Offset 22

7.1.1.  TCP Connect TLV

   The TCP Connect TLV indicates the final destination of the TCP
   connection associated to a given QUIC stream.  The fields Remote Peer
   Port and Remote Peer IP Address contain the destination port number
   and IP address of the final destination.

   The Remote Peer IP Address MUST be encoded as an IPv6 address.  IPv4
   addresses MUST be encoded using the IPv4-Mapped IPv6 Address format
   defined in [RFC4291].  Further, the Remote Peer IP address field MUST
   NOT include multicast, broadcast, and host loopback addresses
   [RFC6890].

   A QUIC tunnel peer MUST NOT send more than one TCP Connect TLV per
   QUIC stream.  A QUIC tunnel peer MUST NOT send a TCP Connect TLV if a
   TCP Extended Connect TLV was previously sent on a given stream.  A

7.1.2.  TCP Extended Connect TLV

   The TCP Extended Connect TLV is an extended version of the TCP
   Connect TLV.  It also indicates the source of the TCP connection.
   The fields Remote Peer Port and Remote Peer IP Address contain the
   destination port number and IP address of the final destination.  The
   fields Local Peer Port and Local Peer IP Address contain the source
   port number and IP address of the source of the TCP connection.

   The Remote (resp.  Local) Peer IP Address MUST be encoded as an IPv6
   address.  IPv4 addresses MUST be encoded using the IPv4-Mapped IPv6
   Address format defined in [RFC4291].  Further, the Remote (resp.
   Local) Peer IP address field MUST NOT include multicast, broadcast,
   and host loopback addresses [RFC6890].

   A QUIC tunnel peer MUST NOT send more than one TCP Extended Connect
   TLV per QUIC stream.  A QUIC tunnel peer MUST NOT send a TCP Extended
   Connect TLV if a TCP Connect TLV was previously sent on a given

                    Figure 8: TCP Extended Connect TLV

7.1.3.  TCP Connect OK TLV

   The TCP Connect OK TLV does not contain a value.  Its presence
   confirms the successful establishment of connection to the final
   destination.  A QUIC peer MUST NOT send a TCP Connect OK TLV on self-
   initiated streams.

7.1.4.  Error TLV

   The Error TLV indicates out-of-band errors that occurred during the
   establishment of the connection to the final destination.  These
   errors can be ICMP Destination Unreachable messages for instance.  In
   this case the ICMP packet received by the concentrator is copied
   inside the Error Payload field.

   | Code | Name                      |

   +------+---------------------------+

                  Figure 10: Bytestream-level Error Codes

   o  Protocol Violation (0x0): A general error code for all non-
      conforming behaviors encountered.  A QUIC tunnel peer SHOULD use a
      more specific error code when possible.

   o  ICMP Packet Received (0x1): This code indicates that the
      concentrator received an ICMP packet while trying to create the
      associated TCP connection.  The Error Payload contains the packet.

   o  Malformed TLV (0x2): This code indicates that a received TLV was
      not successfully parsed or formed.  A peer receiving a Connect TLV
      with an invalid IP address MUST send an Error TLV with this error
      code.

   o  Network Failure (0x3): This codes indicates that a network failure
      prevented the establishment of the connection.

   After sending one or more Error TLVs, the sender MUST send an End TLV
   and terminate the stream, i.e. set the FIN bit after the End TLV.

7.1.5.  End TLV

   The End TLV does not contain a value.  Its existence signals the end
   of the series of TLVs.  The next byte in the QUIC stream after this
   TLV is the start of the tunneled bytestream.

8.  Example flows

   This section illustrates the different messages described previously
   and how they are used in a QUIC tunnel connection.  For QUIC STREAM
   frames, we use the following syntax: STREAM[ID, Stream Data [, FIN]].
   The first element is the Stream ID, the second is the Stream Data
   contained in the frame and the last one is optional and indicates
   that the FIN bit is set.

   Legend:
      --- Multipath QUIC connection
      === TCP connection

                Figure 11: Example flow for the stream mode

   On Figure 11, the Client is initiating a TCP connection in stream
   mode to the Final Destination.  A request and a response are
   exchanged, then the connection is torn down gracefully.  A remote-
   initiated connection accepted by the concentrator on behalf of the
   client would have the order and the direction of all messages
   reversed.

9.  Security Considerations

9.1.  Privacy

   The Concentrator has access to all the packets it processes.  It MUST
   be protected as a core IP router, e.g. as specified in [RFC1812].

9.2.  Ingress Filtering

   Ingress filtering policies MUST be enforced at the network
   boundaries, i.e. as specified in [RFC2827].

Internet-Draft                 QUIC Tunnel                 November 2019


9.3.  Denial of Service

   There is a risk of an amplification attack when the Concentrator
   sends a TCP SYN in response of a TCP Connect TLV.  When a TCP SYN is
   larger than the client request, the Concentrator amplifies the client
   traffic.  To mitigate such attacks, the Concentrator SHOULD rate
   limit the number of pending TCP Connect from a given client.

10.  IANA Considerations

10.1.  Registration of QUIC tunnel Identification String

   This document creates a new registration for the identification of
   the QUIC tunnel protocol in the "Application Layer Protocol
   Negotiation (ALPN) Protocol IDs" registry established in [RFC7301].

   The "qt" string identifies the QUIC tunnel protocol.

   Protocol: QUIC tunnel

   Identification Sequence: 0x71 0x74 ("qt")

   Specification: This document

10.2.  QUIC tunnel stream TLVs

   IANA is requested to create a new "QUIC tunnel stream Parameters"
   registry.

   The following subsections detail new registries within "QUIC tunnel
   stream Parameters" registry.

10.2.1.  QUIC tunnel stream TLVs Types

   IANA is request to create the "QUIC tunnel stream TLVs Types" sub-
   registry.  New values are assigned via IETF Review (Section 4.8 of
   [RFC8126]).

   The initial values to be assigned at the creation of the registry are
   as follows:
