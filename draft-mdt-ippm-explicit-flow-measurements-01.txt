                 Explicit Flow Measurements Techniques
              draft-mdt-ippm-explicit-flow-measurements-01

Abstract

   This document describes protocol independent methods called Explicit
   Flow Measurement Techniques that employ few marking bits, inside the
   header of each packet, for loss and delay measurement.  The
   endpoints, marking the traffic, signal these metrics to intermediate
   observers allowing them to measure connection performance, and to
   locate the network segment where impairments happen.  Different
   alternatives are considered within this document.  These signaling
   methods apply to all protocols but they are especially valuable when
   applied to protocols that encrypt transport header and do not allow
   traditional methods for delay and loss detection.

1.  Introduction

   Packet loss and delay are hard and pervasive problems of day-to-day
   network operation.  Proactively detecting, measuring, and locating
   them is crucial to maintaining high QoS and timely resolution of
   crippling end-to-end throughput issues.  To this effect, in a TCP-
   dominated world, network operators have been heavily relying on
   information present in the clear in TCP headers: sequence and
   acknowledgment numbers and SACKs when enabled (see [RFC8517]).  These
   allow for quantitative estimation of packet loss and delay by passive
   on-path observation.  Additionally, the problem can be quickly
   identified in the network path by moving the passive observer around.

   With encrypted protocols, the equivalent transport headers are
   encrypted and passive packet loss and delay observations are not
   possible, as described in [TRANSPORT-ENCRYPT].

   Measuring TCP loss and delay between similar endpoints cannot be
   relied upon to evaluate encrypted protocol loss and delay.  Different

   protocols could be routed by the network differently, and the
   fraction of Internet traffic delivered using protocols other than TCP
   is increasing every year.  It is imperative to measure packet loss
   and delay experienced by encrypted protocol users directly.

   This document defines Explicit Flow Measurement Techniques.  These
   hybrid measurement path signals (see [IPM-Methods]) are to be
   embedded into a transport layer protocol and are explicitly intended
   for exposing RTT and loss rate information to on-path measurement
   devices.  These measurement mechanisms are applicable to any
   transport-layer protocol, and, as an example, the document describes
   QUIC and TCP bindings.

   The Explicit Flow Measurement Techniques described in this document
   can be used alone or in combination with other Explicit Flow
   Measurement Techniques.  Each technique uses a small number of bits
   and exposes a specific measurement.

   Following the recommendation in [RFC8558] of making path signals
   explicit, this document proposes adding a small number of dedicated
   measurement bits to the clear portion of the protocol headers.  These
   bits can be added to an encrypted portion of a header belonging to
   any protocol layer, e.g.  IP (see [IP]) and IPv6 (see [IPv6]) headers
   or extensions, such as [IPv6AltMark], UDP surplus space (see
   [UDP-OPTIONS] and [UDP-SURPLUS]), reserved bits in a QUIC v1 header
   (see [QUIC-TRANSPORT]).

   The measurements are not designed for use in automated control of the
   network in environments where signal bits are set by untrusted hosts.
   Instead, the signal is to be used for troubleshooting individual
   flows as well as for monitoring the network by aggregating
   information from multiple flows and raising operator alarms if
   aggregate statistics indicate a potential problem.

   The spin bit, delay bit and loss bits explained in this document are
   inspired by [AltMark], [SPIN-BIT], [I-D.trammell-tsvwg-spin] and
   [I-D.trammell-ippm-spin].

   Additional details about the Performance Measurements for QUIC are
   described in the paper [ANRW19-PM-QUIC].

3.  Latency Bits

   This section introduces bits that can be used for round trip latency
   measurements.  Whenever this section of the specification refers to
   packets, it is referring only to packets with protocol headers that
   include the latency bits.

   [QUIC-TRANSPORT] introduces an explicit per-flow transport-layer
   signal for hybrid measurement of RTT.  This signal consists of a spin
   bit that toggles once per RTT.  [SPIN-BIT] discusses an additional
   two-bit Valid Edge Counter (VEC) to compensate for loss and
   reordering of the spin bit and increase fidelity of the signal in
   less than ideal network conditions.

   This document introduces a stand-alone single-bit delay signal that
   can be used by passive observers to measure the RTT of a network
   flow, avoiding the spin bit ambiguities that arise as soon as network
   conditions deteriorate.

3.1.  Spin Bit

   This section is a small recap of the spin bit working mechanism.  For
   a comprehensive explanation of the algorithm, please see [SPIN-BIT].

   The spin bit is an alternate marking [AltMark] generated signal,
   where the size of the alternation changes with the flight size each
   RTT.

   The latency spin bit is a single bit signal that toggles once per
   RTT, enabling latency monitoring of a connection-oriented
   communication from intermediate observation points.

   A "spin period" is a set of packets with the same spin bit value sent
   during one RTT time interval.  A "spin period value" is the value of
   the spin bit shared by all packets in a spin period.

   The client and server maintain an internal per-connection spin value
   (i.e. 0 or 1) used to set the spin bit on outgoing packets.  Both
   endpoints initialize the spin value to 0 when a new connection
   starts.  Then:

   -  when the client receives a packet with the packet number larger
      than any number seen so far, it sets the connection spin value to
      the opposite value contained in the received packet;

   -  when the server receives a packet with the packet number larger
      than any number seen so far, it sets the connection spin value to
      the same value contained in the received packet.

Internet-Draft             Delay and Loss bits             February 2021


   The computed spin value is used by the endpoints for setting the spin
   bit on outgoing packets.  This mechanism allows the endpoints to
   generate a square wave such that, by measuring the distance in time
   between pairs of consecutive edges observed in the same direction, a
   passive on-path observer can compute the round trip delay of that
   network flow.

   Spin bit enables round trip latency measurement by observing a single
   direction of the traffic flow.

   Note that packet reordering can cause spurious edges that require
   heuristics to correct.  The spin bit performance deteriorates as soon
   as network impairments arise as explained in Section 3.2.

3.2.  Delay Bit

   The delay bit has been designed to overcome accuracy limitations
   experienced by the spin bit under difficult network conditions:

   -  packet reordering leads to generation of spurious edges and errors
      in delay estimation;

   -  loss of edges causes wrong estimation of spin periods and
      therefore wrong RTT measurements;

   -  application-limited senders cause the spin bit to measure the
      application delays instead of network delays.

   Unlike the spin bit, which is set in every packet transmitted on the
   network, the delay bit is set only once per round trip.

   When the delay bit is used, a single packet with a marked bit (the
   delay bit) bounces between a client and a server during the entire
   connection lifetime.  This single packet is called "delay sample".

   An observer placed at an intermediate point, observing a single
   direction of traffic, tracking the delay sample and the relative
   timestamp, can measure the round trip delay of the connection.

   The delay sample lifetime is comprised of two phases: initialization
   and reflection.  The initialization is the generation of the delay
   sample, while the reflection realizes the bounce behavior of this
   single packet between the two endpoints.

   The next figure describes the elementary Delay bit mechanism.

3.2.1.  Generation Phase

   Only client is actively involved in the generation phase.  It
   maintains an internal per-flow timestamp variable ("ds_time") updated
   every time a delay sample is transmitted.

   When connection starts, the client generates a new delay sample
   initializing the delay bit of the first outgoing packet to 1.  Then
   it updates the "ds_time" variable with the timestamp of its
   transmission.

   The server initializes the delay bit to 0 at the beginning of the
   connection, and its only task during the connection is described in
   Section 3.2.2.

   In absence of network impairments, the delay sample should bounce
   between client and server continuously, for the entire duration of
   the connection.  That is highly unlikely for two reasons:

   1.  the packet carrying the delay bit might be lost;

   2.  an endpoint could stop or delay sending packets because the
       application is limiting the amount of traffic transmitted;

   To deal with these problems, the client generates a new delay sample
   if more than a predetermined time ("T_Max") has elapsed since the
   last delay sample transmission (including reflections).  Note that
   "T_Max" should be greater than the max measurable RTT on the network.
   See Section 3.2.3 for details.

3.2.2.  Reflection Phase

   Reflection is the process that enables the bouncing of the delay
   sample between a client and a server.  The behavior of the two
   endpoints is almost the same.

   -  Server side reflection: when a delay sample arrives, the server
      marks the first packet in the opposite direction as the delay
      sample.

   -  Client side reflection: when a delay sample arrives, the client
      marks the first packet in the opposite direction as the delay
      sample.  It also updates the "ds_time" variable when the outgoing
      delay sample is actually forwarded.

   In both cases, if the outgoing delay sample is being transmitted with
   a delay greater than a predetermined threshold after the reception of

   the incoming delay sample (1ms by default), the delay sample is not
   reflected, and the outgoing delay bit is kept at 0.

   By doing so, the algorithm can reject measurements that would
   overestimate the delay due to lack of traffic on the endpoints.
   Hence, the maximum estimation error would amount to twice the
   threshold (e.g. 2ms) per measurement.

3.2.3.  T_Max Selection

   The internal "ds_time" variable allows a client to identify delay
   sample losses.  Considering that a lost delay sample is regenerated
   at the end of an explicit time ("T_Max") since the last generation,
   this same value can be used by an observer to reject a measure and
   start a new one.

   In other words, if the difference in time between two delay samples
   is greater or equal than "T_Max", then these cannot be used to
   produce a delay measure.  Therefore the value of "T_Max" must also be
   known to the on-path network probes.

   There are two alternatives to select the "T_Max" value so that both
   client and observers know it.  The first one requires that "T_Max" is
   known a priori ("T_Max_p") and therefore set within the protocol
   specifications that implements the marking mechanism (e.g. 1 second
   which usually is greater than the max expectable RTT).  The second
   alternative requires a dynamic mechanism able to adapt the duration
   of the "T_Max" to the delay of the connection ("T_Max_c").

   For instance, client and observers could use the connection RTT as a
   basis for calculating an effective "T_Max".  They should use a
   predetermined initial value so that "T_Max = T_Max_p" (e.g. 1 second)
   and then, when a valid RTT is measured, change "T_Max" accordingly so
   that "T_Max = T_Max_c".  In any case, the selected "T_Max" should be
   large enough to absorb any possible variations in the connection
   delay.

   "T_Max_c" could be computed as two times the measured "RTT" plus a
   fixed amount of time ("100ms") to prevent low "T_Max" values in case
   of very small RTTs.  The resulting formula is: "T_Max_c = 2RTT +
   100ms".  If "T_Max_c" is greater than "T_Max_p" then "T_Max_c" is
   forced to "T_Max_p" value.

   Note that the observer's "T_Max" should always be less than or equal
   to the client's "T_Max" to avoid considering as a valid measurement
   what is actually the client's "T_Max".  To obtain this result, the
   client waits for two consecutive incoming samples and computes the
   two related RTTs.  Then it takes the largest of them as the basis of

   the "T_Max_c" formula.  At this point, observers have already
   measured a valid RTT and then computed their "T_Max_c".

3.2.4.  Delay Measurement using Delay Bit

   When the Delay Bit is used, a passive observer can use delay samples
   directly and avoid inherent ambiguities in the calculation of the RTT
   as can be seen in spin bit analysis.

3.2.4.1.  RTT Measurement

   The delay sample generation process ensures that only one packet
   marked with the delay bit set to 1 runs back and forth between two
   endpoints per round trip time.  To determine the RTT measurement of a
   flow, an on-path passive observer computes the time difference
   between two delay samples observed in a single direction.

   To ensure a valid measurement, the observer must verify that the
   distance in time between the two samples taken into account is less
   than "T_Max".

3.2.4.2.  Half-RTT Measurement

   An observer that is able to observe both forward and return traffic
   directions can use the delay samples to measure "upstream" and
   "downstream" RTT components, also known as the half-RTT measurements.
   It does this by measuring the time between a delay sample observed in
   one direction and the delay sample previously observed in the
   opposite direction.

   As with RTT measurement, the observer must verify that the distance
   in time between the two samples taken into account is less than
   "T_Max".

   Note that upstream and downstream sections of paths between the
   endpoints and the observer, i.e. observer-to-client vs client-to-
   observer and observer-to-server vs server-to-observer, may have
   different delay characteristics due to the difference in network
   congestion and other factors.

   Intra-domain RTT is the portion of the entire RTT used by a flow to
   traverse the network of a provider.  To measure intra-domain RTT, two
   observers capable of observing traffic in both directions must be
   employed simultaneously at ingress and egress of the network to be
   measured.  Intra-domain RTT is difference between the two computed
   upstream (or downstream) RTT components.

3.2.5.  Observer's Algorithm

   An on-path observer maintains an internal per-flow variable to keep
   track of time at which the last delay sample has been observed.

   A unidirectional observer, upon detecting a delay sample:

   -  if a delay sample was also detected previously in the same
      direction and the distance in time between them is less than
      "T_Max - K", then the two delay samples can be used to calculate
      RTT measurement.  "K" is a protection threshold to absorb
      differences in "T_Max" computation and delay variations between
      two consecutive delay samples (e.g.  "K = 10% T_Max").

   If the observer can observe both forward and return traffic flows,
   and it is able to determine which direction contains the client and
   the server (e.g. by observing the connection handshake), upon
   detecting a delay sample:

   -  if a delay sample was also detected in the opposite direction and
      the distance in time between them is less than "T_Max - K", then
      the two delay samples can be used to measure the observer-client
      half-RTT or the observer-server half-RTT, according to the
      direction of the last delay sample observed.

3.2.6.  Two Bits Delay Measurement: Spin Bit + Delay Bit

   Spin and Delay bit algorithms work independently.  If both marking
   methods are used in the same connection, observers can choose the
   best measurement between the two available:

   -  when a precise measurement can be produced using the delay bit,
      observers choose it;

   -  when a delay bit measurement is not available, observers choose
      the approximate spin bit one.

4.  Loss Bits

   This section introduces bits that can be used for loss measurements.
   Whenever this section of the specification refers to packets, it is
   referring only to packets with protocol headers that include the loss
   bits - the only packets whose loss can be measured.

   -  T: the "round Trip loss" bit is used in combination with the Spin
      bit to measure round-trip loss.  See Section 4.1.

   -  Q: the "sQuare signal" bit is used to measure upstream loss.  See
      Section 4.2.

   -  L: the "Loss event" bit is used to measure end-to-end loss.  See
      Section 4.3.

   -  R: the "Reflection square signal" bit is used in combination with
      Q bit to measure end-to-end loss.  See Section 4.1.

   Loss measurements enabled by T, Q, and L bits can be implemented by
   those loss bits alone (T bit requires a working Spin Bit).  Two-bit
   combinations Q+L and Q+R enable additional measurement opportunities
   discussed below.

   Each endpoint maintains appropriate counters independently and
   separately for each separately identifiable flow (each sub-flow for
   multipath connections).

   Since loss is reported independently for each flow, all bits (except
   for L bit) require a certain minimum number of packets to be
   exchanged per flow before any signal can be measured.  Therefore,
   loss measurements work best for flows that transfer more than a
   minimal amount of data.

4.1.  T Bit - Round Trip Loss Bit

   The round Trip loss bit is used to mark a variable number of packets
   exchanged twice between the endpoints realizing a two round-trip
   reflection.  A passive on-path observer, observing either direction,
   can count and compare the number of marked packets seen during the
   two reflections, estimating the loss rate experienced by the
   connection.  The overall exchange comprises:

   -  The client selects, generates and consequently transmits a first
      train of packets, by setting the T bit to 1;

   -  The server, upon receiving each packet included in the first
      train, reflects to the client a respective second train of packets
      of the same size as the first train received, by setting the T bit
      to 1;

   -  The client, upon receiving each packet included in the second
      train, reflects to the server a respective third train of packets
      of the same size as the second train received, by setting the T
      bit to 1;

   -  The server, upon receiving each packet included in the third
      train, finally reflects to the client a respective fourth train of
      packets of the same size as the third train received, by setting
      the T bit to 1.

   Packets belonging to the first round trip (first and second train)
   represent the Generation Phase, while those belonging to the second
   round trip (third and fourth train) represent the Reflection Phase.

   A passive on-path observer can count and compare the number of marked
   packets seen during the two round trips (i.e. the first and third or
   the second and the fourth trains of packets, depending on which
   direction is observed) and estimate the loss rate experienced by the
   connection.  This process is repeated continuously to obtain more
   measurements as long as the endpoints exchange traffic.  These
   measurements can be called Round Trip losses.

   Since packet rates in two directions may be different, the number of
   marked packets in the train is determined by the direction with the
   lowest packet rate.  See Section 4.1.2 for details on packet
   generation and for a mechanism to allow an observer to distinguish
   between trains belonging to different phases (Generation and
   Reflection).

4.1.1.  Round Trip Packet Loss Measurement

   Since the measurements are performed on a portion of the traffic
   exchanged between the client and the server, the observer calculates
   the end-to-end Round Trip Packet Loss (RTPL) that, statistically,
   will correspond to the loss rate experienced by the connection along
   the entire network path.

           Intra-domain Round-trip packet loss (observer-server)

4.1.2.  Setting the Round Trip Loss Bit on Outgoing Packets

   The round Trip loss signal requires a working Spin-bit signal to
   separate trains of marked packets (packets with T bit set to 1).  A
   "pause" of at least one empty spin-bit period between each phase of
   the algorithm serves as such separator for the on-path observer.

   The client is in charge of launching trains of marked packets and
   does so according to the algorithm:

   1.  Generation Phase.  The client starts generating marked packets
       for two consecutive spin-bit periods; it maintains a "generation
       token" count that is reset to zero at the beginning of the
       algorithm phase and is incremented every time a packet arrives.
       When the client transmits a packet and a "generation token" is
       available, the client marks the packet and retires a "generation
       token".  If no token is available, the outgoing packet is
       transmitted unmarked.  At the end of the first spin-bit period
       spent in generation, the reflection counter is unlocked to start
       counting incoming marked packets that will be reflected later;

   2.  Pause Phase.  When the generation is completed, the client pauses
       till it has observed one entire spin bit period with no marked
       packets.  That spin bit period is used by the observer as a
       separator between generated and reflected packets.  During this
       marking pause, all the outgoing packets are transmitted with T




Cociglio, et al.         Expires August 26, 2021               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft             Delay and Loss bits             February 2021


       bit set to 0.  The reflection counter is still incremented every
       time a marked packet arrives;

   3.  Reflection Phase.  The client starts transmitting marked packets,
       decrementing the reflection counter for each transmitted marked
       packet until the reflection counter reached zero.  The
       "generation token" method from the generation phase is used
       during this phase as well.  At the end of the first spin-period
       spent in reflection, the reflection counter is locked to avoid
       incoming reflected packets incrementing it;

   4.  Pause Phase 2.  The pause phase is repeated after the reflection
       phase and serves as a separator between the reflected packet
       train and a new packet train.

   The generation token counter should be capped to limit the effects of
   a subsequent sudden reduction in the other endpoint's packet rate
   that could prevent that endpoint from reflecting collected packets.
   The most conservative cap value is "1".

   A server maintains a "marking counter" that starts at zero and is
   incremented every time a marked packet arrives.  When the server
   transmits a packet and the "marking counter" is positive, the server
   marks the packet and decrements the "marking counter".  If the
   "marking counter" is zero, the outgoing packet is transmitted
   unmarked.

4.1.3.  Observer's Logic for Round Trip Loss Signal

   The on-path observer counts marked packets and separates different
   trains by detecting spin-bit periods (at least one) with no marked
   packets.  The Round Trip Packet Loss (RTPL) is the difference between
   the size of the Generation train and the Reflection train.

   In the following example, packets are represented by two bits (first
   one is the spin bit, second one is the loss bit):

           Generation          Pause           Reflection       Pause
      ____________________ ______________ ____________________ ________
     |                    |              |                    |        |

                      Round Trip Loss signal example

   Note that 5 marked packets have been generated of which 4 have been
   reflected.

4.1.4.  Loss Coverage and Signal Timing

   A cycle of the round Trip loss signaling algorithm contains 2 RTTs of
   Generation phase, 2 RTTs of Reflection phase, and two Pause phases at
   least 1 RTT in duration each.  Hence, the loss signal is delayed by
   about 6 RTTs since the loss events.

   The observer can only detect loss of marked packets that occurs after
   its initial observation of the Generation phase and before its
   subsequent observation of the Reflection phase.  Hence, if the loss
   occurs on the path that sends packets at a lower rate (typically ACKs
   in such asymmetric scenarios), "2/6" ("1/3") of the packets will be
   sampled for loss detection.

   If the loss occurs on the path that sends packets at a higher rate,
   "lowPacketRate/(3*highPacketRate)" of the packets will be sampled for
   loss detection.  For protocols that use ACKs, the portion of packets
   sampled for loss in the higher rate direction during unidirectional
   data transfer is "1/(3*packetsPerAck)", where the value of
   "packetsPerAck" can vary by protocol, by implementation, and by
   network conditions.

4.2.  Q Bit - Square Bit

   The sQuare bit (Q bit) takes its name from the square wave generated
   by its signal.  Every outgoing packet contains the Q bit value, which
   is initialized to the 0 and inverted after sending N packets (a
   sQuare Block or simply Q Block).  Hence, Q Period is 2*N.  The Q bit
   represents "packet color" as defined by [AltMark].

   Observation points can estimate upstream losses by watching a single
   direction of the traffic flow and counting the number of packets in
   each observed Q Block, as described in Section 4.2.2.

   The length of the block must be known to the on-path network probes.
   There are two alternatives to selecting the Q Block length.  The
   first one requires that the length is known a priori and therefore
   set within the protocol specifications that implements the marking
   mechanism.  The second requires the sender to select it.

   In this latter scenario, the sender is expected to choose N (Q Block
   length) based on the expected amount of loss and reordering on the
   path.  The choice of N strikes a compromise - the observation could
   become too unreliable in case of packet reordering and/or severe loss
   if N is too small, while short flows may not yield a useful upstream
   loss measurement if N is too large (see Section 4.2.2).

Internet-Draft             Delay and Loss bits             February 2021


   The value of N should be at least 64 and be a power of 2.  This
   requirement allows an Observer to infer the Q Block length by
   observing one period of the square signal.  It also allows the
   Observer to identify flows that set the loss bits to arbitrary values
   (see Section 7).

   If the sender does not have sufficient information to make an
   informed decision about Q Block length, the sender should use N=64,
   since this value has been extensively tried in large-scale field
   tests and yielded good results.  Alternatively, the sender may also
   choose a random power-of-2 N for each flow, increasing the chances of
   using a Q Block length that gives the best signal for some flows.

   The sender must keep the value of N constant for a given flow.

4.2.2.  Upstream Loss

   Blocks of N (Q Block length) consecutive packets are sent with the
   same value of the Q bit, followed by another block of N packets with
   an inverted value of the Q bit.  Hence, knowing the value of N, an
   on-path observer can estimate the amount of upstream loss after
   observing at least N packets.  The upstream loss rate ("uloss") is
   one minus the average number of packets in a block of packets with
   the same Q value ("p") divided by N ("uloss=1-avg(p)/N").

   The observer needs to be able to tolerate packet reordering that can
   blur the edges of the square signal, as explained in Section 4.2.3.

4.2.3.  Identifying Q Block Boundaries

   Packet reordering can produce spurious edges in the square signal.
   To address this, the observer should look for packets with the
   current Q bit value up to X packets past the first packet with a
   reverse Q bit value.  The value of X, a "Marking Block Threshold",
   should be less than "N/2".

   The choice of X represents a trade-off between resiliency to
   reordering and resiliency to loss.  A very large Marking Block
   Threshold will be able to reconstruct Q Blocks despite a significant
   amount of reordring, but it may erroneously coalesce packets from
   multiple Q Blocks into fewer Q Blocks, if loss exceeds 50% for some Q
   Blocks.

4.3.  L Bit - Loss Event Bit

   The Loss Event bit uses an Unreported Loss counter maintained by the
   protocol that implements the marking mechanism.  To use the Loss
   Event bit, the protocol must allow the sender to identify lost
   packets.  This is true of protocols such as QUIC, partially true for
   TCP and SCTP (losses of pure ACKs are not detected) and is not true
   of protocols such as UDP and IP/IPv6.

   The Unreported Loss counter is initialized to 0, and L bit of every
   outgoing packet indicates whether the Unreported Loss counter is
   positive (L=1 if the counter is positive, and L=0 otherwise).

   The value of the Unreported Loss counter is decremented every time a
   packet with L=1 is sent.

   The value of the Unreported Loss counter is incremented for every
   packet that the protocol declares lost, using whatever loss detection
   machinery the protocol employs.  If the protocol is able to rescind
   the loss determination later, a positive Unreported Loss counter may
   be decremented due to the rescission, but it should NOT become
   negative due to the rescission.

   This loss signaling is similar to loss signaling in [ConEx], except
   the Loss Event bit is reporting the exact number of lost packets,
   whereas Echo Loss bit in [ConEx] is reporting an approximate number
   of lost bytes.

   For protocols, such as TCP ([TCP]), that allow network devices to
   change data segmentation, it is possible that only a part of the
   packet is lost.  In these cases, the sender must increment Unreported
   Loss counter by the fraction of the packet data lost (so Unreported

   Loss counter may become negative when a packet with L=1 is sent after
   a partial packet has been lost).

   Observation points can estimate the end-to-end loss, as determined by
   the upstream endpoint, by counting packets in this direction with the
   L bit equal to 1, as described in Section 4.3.1.

4.3.1.  End-To-End Loss

   The Loss Event bit allows an observer to estimate the end-to-end loss
   rate by counting packets with L bit value of 0 and 1 for a given
   flow.  The end-to-end loss rate is the fraction of packets with L=1.

   The assumption here is that upstream loss affects packets with L=0
   and L=1 equally.  If some loss is caused by tail-drop in a network
   device, this may be a simplification.  If the sender's congestion
   controller reduces the packet send rate after loss, there may be a
   sufficient delay before sending packets with L=1 that they have a
   greater chance of arriving at the observer.

4.3.2.  Loss Profile Characterization

   In addition to measuring the end-to-end loss rate, the Loss Event bit
   allows an observer to characterize loss profile, since the
   distribution of observed packets with L bit set to 1 roughly
   corresponds to the distribution of packets lost between 1 RTT and 1
   RTO before (see Section 4.4.1).  Hence, observing random single
   instances of L bit set to 1 indicates random single packet loss,
   while observing blocks of packets with L bit set to 1 indicates loss
   affecting entire blocks of packets.

4.4.  L+Q Bits - Upstream, Downstream, and End-to-End Loss Measurements

   Combining L and Q bits allows a passive observer watching a single
   direction of traffic to accurately measure:

   -  upstream loss: sender-to-observer loss (see Section 4.2.2)

   -  downstream loss: observer-to-receiver loss (see Section 4.4.1.1)

   -  end-to-end loss: sender-to-receiver loss on the observed path (see
      Section 4.3.1) with loss profile characterization (see
      Section 4.3.2)

Internet-Draft             Delay and Loss bits             February 2021


4.4.1.  Correlating End-to-End and Upstream Loss

   Upstream loss is calculated by observing packets that did not suffer
   the upstream loss (Section 4.2.2).  End-to-end loss, however, is
   calculated by observing subsequent packets after the sender's
   protocol detected the loss.  Hence, end-to-end loss is generally
   observed with a delay of between 1 RTT (loss declared due to multiple
   duplicate acknowledgments) and 1 RTO (loss declared due to a timeout)
   relative to the upstream loss.

   The flow RTT can sometimes be estimated by timing protocol handshake
   messages.  This RTT estimate can be greatly improved by observing a
   dedicated protocol mechanism for conveying RTT information, such as
   the Spin bit (see Section 3.1) or Delay bit (see Section 3.2).

   Whenever the observer needs to perform a computation that uses both
   upstream and end-to-end loss rate measurements, it should use
   upstream loss rate leading the end-to-end loss rate by approximately
   1 RTT.  If the observer is unable to estimate RTT of the flow, it
   should accumulate loss measurements over time periods of at least 4
   times the typical RTT for the observed flows.

   If the calculated upstream loss rate exceeds the end-to-end loss rate
   calculated in Section 4.3.1, then either the Q Period is too short
   for the amount of packet reordering or there is observer loss,
   described in Section 4.4.1.2.  If this happens, the observer should
   adjust the calculated upstream loss rate to match end-to-end loss
   rate, unless the following applies.

   In case of a protocol like TCP and SCTP that does not track losses of
   pure ACK packets, observing a direction of traffic dominated by pure
   ACK packets could result in measured upstream loss that is higher
   than measured end-to-end loss, if said pure ACK packets are lost
   upstream.  Hence, if the measurement is applied to such protocols,
   and the observer can confirm that pure ACK packets dominate the
   observed traffic direction, the observer should adjust the calculated
   end-to-end loss rate to match upstream loss rate.

4.4.1.1.  Downstream Loss

   Because downstream loss affects only those packets that did not
   suffer upstream loss, the end-to-end loss rate ("eloss") relates to
   the upstream loss rate ("uloss") and downstream loss rate ("dloss")
   as "(1-uloss)(1-dloss)=1-eloss".  Hence, "dloss=(eloss-
   uloss)/(1-uloss)".

Internet-Draft             Delay and Loss bits             February 2021


4.4.1.2.  Observer Loss

   A typical deployment of a passive observation system includes a
   network tap device that mirrors network packets of interest to a
   device that performs analysis and measurement on the mirrored
   packets.  The observer loss is the loss that occurs on the mirror
   path.

   Observer loss affects upstream loss rate measurement, since it causes
   the observer to account for fewer packets in a block of identical Q
   bit values (see Section 4.2.2).  The end-to-end loss rate
   measurement, however, is unaffected by the observer loss, since it is
   a measurement of the fraction of packets with the L bit value of 1,
   and the observer loss would affect all packets equally (see
   Section 4.3.1).

   The need to adjust the upstream loss rate down to match end-to-end
   loss rate as described in Section 4.4.1 is an indication of the
   observer loss, whose magnitude is between the amount of such
   adjustment and the entirety of the upstream loss measured in
   Section 4.2.2.  Alternatively, a high apparent upstream loss rate
   could be an indication of significant packet reordering, possibly due
   to packets belonging to a single flow being multiplexed over several
   upstream paths with different latency characteristics.

4.5.  R Bit - Reflection Square Bit

   R bit requires a deployment alongside Q bit.  Unlike the square
   signal for which packets are transmitted into blocks of fixed size,
   the Reflection square signal (being an alternate marking signal too)
   produces blocks of packets whose size varies according to these
   rules:

   -  when the transmission of a new block starts, its size is set equal
      to the size of the last Q Block whose reception has been
      completed;

   -  if, before transmission of the block is terminated, the reception
      of at least one further Q Block is completed, the size of the
      block is updated to the average size of the further received Q
      Blocks.  Implementation details follow.

   The Reflection square value is initialized to 0 and is applied to the
   R-bit of every outgoing packet.  The Reflection square value is
   toggled for the first time when the completion of a Q Block is
   detected in the incoming square signal (produced by the opposite node
   using the Q-bit).  When this happens, the number of packets ("p"),
   detected within this first Q Block, is used to generate a reflection



Cociglio, et al.         Expires August 26, 2021               [Page 23]

Internet-Draft             Delay and Loss bits             February 2021


   square signal which toggles every "M=p" packets (at first).  This new
   signal produces blocks of M packets (marked using the R-bit) and each
   of them is called "Reflection Block" (R Block).

   The M value is then updated every time a completed Q Block in the
   incoming square signal is received, following this formula:
   "M=round(avg(p))".

   The parameter "avg(p)" is the average number of packets in a marking
   period computed considering all the Q Blocks received since the
   beginning of the current R Block.

   To ensure a proper computation of the M value, endpoints implementing
   the R bit must identify the boundaries of incoming Q Blocks.  The
   same approach described in {#endmarkingblock} should be used.

   Looking at the R-bit, unidirectional observation points have an
   indication of losses experienced by the entire unobserved channel
   plus those occurred in the path from the sender up to them.

   Since the Q Block is sent in one direction, and the corresponding
   reflected R Block is sent in the opposite direction, the reflected R
   signal is transmitted with the packet rate of the slowest direction.
   Namely, if the observed direction is the slowest, there can be
   multiple Q Blocks transmitted in the unobserved direction before a
   complete R Block is transmitted in the observed direction.  If the
   unobserved direction is the slowest, the observed direction can be
   sending R Blocks of the same size repeatedly before it can update the
   signal to account for a newly-completed Q Block.

4.5.1.  R+Q Bits - Using R and Q Bits for Passive Loss Measurement

   Since both sQuare and Reflection square bits are toggled at most
   every N packets (except for the first transition of the R-bit as
   explained before), an on-path observer can count the number of
   packets of each marking block and, knowing the value of N, can
   estimate the amount of loss experienced by the connection.  An
   observer can calculate different measurements depending on whether it
   is able to observe a single direction of the traffic or both
   directions.

   Single directional observer:

   -  upstream loss in the observed direction: the loss between the
      sender and the observation point (see Section 4.2.2)

Internet-Draft             Delay and Loss bits             February 2021


   -  "three-quarters" connection loss: the loss between the receiver
      and the sender in the unobserved direction plus the loss between
      the sender and the observation point in the observed direction

   -  end-to-end loss in the unobserved direction: the loss between the
      receiver and the sender in the opposite direction

   Two directions observer (same metrics seen previously applied to both
   direction, plus):

   -  client-observer half round-trip loss: the loss between the client
      and the observation point in both directions

   -  observer-server half round-trip loss: the loss between the
      observation point and the server in both directions

   -  downstream loss: the loss between the observation point and the
      receiver (applicable to both directions)

4.5.1.1.  Three-Quarters Connection Loss

   Except for the very first block in which there is nothing to reflect
   (a complete Q Block has not been yet received), packets are
   continuously R-bit marked into alternate blocks of size lower or
   equal than N.  Knowing the value of N, an on-path observer can
   estimate the amount of loss occurred in the whole opposite channel
   plus the loss from the sender up to it in the observation channel.
   As for the previous metric, the "three-quarters" connection loss rate
   ("tqloss") is one minus the average number of packets in a block of
   packets with the same R value ("t") divided by "N"
   ("tqloss=1-avg(t)/N").

   loss produced by the Q Bit.

4.5.1.2.  End-To-End Loss in the Opposite Direction

   End-to-end loss in the unobserved direction ("eloss_unobserved")
   relates to the "three-quarters" connection loss ("tqloss") and
   upstream loss in the observed direction ("uloss") as
   "(1-eloss_unobserved)(1-uloss)=1-tqloss".  Hence,
   "eloss_unobserved=(tqloss-uloss)/(1-uloss)".

4.5.1.3.  Half Round-Trip Loss

   If the observer is able to observe both directions of traffic, it is
   able to calculate two "half round-trip" loss measurements - loss from
   the observer to the receiver (in a given direction) and then back to
   the observer in the opposite direction.  For both directions, "half
   round-trip" loss ("hrtloss") relates to "three-quarters" connection
   loss ("tqloss_opposite") measured in the opposite direction and the
   upstream loss ("uloss") measured in the given direction as
   "(1-uloss)(1-hrtloss)=1-tqloss_opposite".  Hence,
   "hrtloss=(tqloss_opposite-uloss)/(1-uloss)".

   to-end loss and upstream loss, similar to the calculation in
   Section 4.4.1.1 or using "half round-trip" loss and upstream loss in
   the opposite direction.

4.5.2.  Enhancement of R Block Length Computation

   The use of the rounding function used in the M computation introduces
   errors that can be minimized by storing the rounding applied each
   time M is computed, and using it during the computation of the M
   value in the following R Block.

   This can be achieved introducing the new "r_avg" parameter in the
   computation of M.  The new formula is "Mr=avg(p)+r_avg; M=round(Mr);
   r_avg=Mr-M" where the initial value of "r_avg" is equal to 0.

4.5.3.  Improved Resilience to Packet Reordering

   When a protocol implementing the marking mechanism is able to detect
   when packets are received out of order, it can improve resilience to
   packet reordering beyond what is possible using methods described in
   Section 4.2.3.

   This can be achieved by updating the size of the current R Block
   while this is being transmitted.  The reflection block size is then
   updated every time an incoming reordered packet of the previous Q
   Block is detected.  This can be done if and only if the transmission
   of the current reflection block is in progress and no packets of the
   following Q Block have been received.

5.  Summary of Delay and Loss Marking Methods

   This section summarizes the marking methods described in this draft.

   For the Delay measurement, it is possible to use the spin bit and/or
   the delay bit.  A unidirectional or bidirectional observer can be
   used.

6.  ECN-Echo Event Bit

   While the primary focus of the draft is on exposing packet loss and
   delay, modern networks can report congestion before they are forced
   to drop packets, as described in [ECN].  When transport protocols
   keep ECN-Echo feedback under encryption, this signal cannot be
   observed by the network operators.  When tasked with diagnosing

Internet-Draft             Delay and Loss bits             February 2021


   network performance problems, knowledge of a congestion downstream of
   an observation point can be instrumental.

   If downstream congestion information is desired, this information can
   be signaled with an additional bit.

   -  E: The "ECN-Echo Event" bit is set to 0 or 1 according to the
      Unreported ECN Echo counter, as explained below in Section 6.1.

6.1.  Setting the ECN-Echo Event Bit on Outgoing Packets

   The Unreported ECN-Echo counter operates identically to Unreported
   Loss counter (Section 4.3), except it counts packets delivered by the
   network with CE markings, according to the ECN-Echo feedback from the
   receiver.

   This ECN-Echo signaling is similar to ECN signaling in [ConEx].  ECN-
   Echo mechanism in QUIC provides the number of packets received with
   CE marks.  For protocols like TCP, the method described in
   [ConEx-TCP] can be employed.  As stated in [ConEx-TCP], such feedback
   can be further improved using a method described in [ACCURATE].

6.2.  Using E Bit for Passive ECN-Reported Congestion Measurement

   A network observer can count packets with CE codepoint and determine
   the upstream CE-marking rate directly.

   Observation points can also estimate ECN-reported end-to-end
   congestion by counting packets in this direction with a E bit equal
   to 1.

   The upstream CE-marking rate and end-to-end ECN-reported congestion
   can provide information about downstream CE-marking rate.  Presence
   of E bits along with L bits, however, can somewhat confound precise
   estimates of upstream and downstream CE-markings in case the flow
   contains packets that are not ECN-capable.

7.  Protocol Ossification Considerations

   Accurate loss and delay information is not critical to the operation
   of any protocol, though its presence for a sufficient number of flows
   is important for the operation of networks.

   The delay and loss bits are amenable to "greasing" described in
   [RFC8701], if the protocol designers are not ready to dedicate (and
   ossify) bits used for loss reporting to this function.  The greasing
   could be accomplished similarly to the Latency Spin bit greasing in
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT].  Namely, implementations could decide that a



Cociglio, et al.         Expires August 26, 2021               [Page 31]

Internet-Draft             Delay and Loss bits             February 2021


   fraction of flows should not encode loss and delay information and,
   instead, the bits would be set to arbitrary values.  The observers
   would need to be ready to ignore flows with delay and loss
   information more resembling noise than the expected signal.

8.  Examples of Application

8.1.  QUIC

   The binding of a delay signal to QUIC is partially described in
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT], which adds the spin bit to the first byte of the
   short packet header, leaving two reserved bits for future
   experiments.

   To implement the additional signals discussed in this document, the
   first byte of the short packet header can be modified as follows:

   -  the delay bit (D) can be placed in the first reserved bit (i.e.
      the fourth most significant bit _0x10_) while the round trip loss
      bit (T) in the second reserved bit (i.e. the fifth most
      significant bit _0x08_); the proposed scheme is:

             0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |0|1|S|D|T|K|P|P|
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                                 Scheme 1

   -  alternatively, a two bits loss signal (QL or QR) can be placed in
      both reserved bits; the proposed schemes, in this case, are:

             0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |0|1|S|Q|L|K|P|P|
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                                 Scheme 2A

             0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |0|1|S|Q|R|K|P|P|
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                                 Scheme 2B

Internet-Draft             Delay and Loss bits             February 2021


   A further option would be to substitute the spin bit with the delay
   bit leaving the two reserved bits for loss detection.  The proposed
   schemes are:

             0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |0|1|D|Q|L|K|P|P|
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                                 Scheme 3A

             0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |0|1|D|Q|R|K|P|P|
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                                 Scheme 3B

8.2.  TCP

   The signals can be added to TCP by defining bit 4 of byte 13 of the
   TCP header to carry the spin bit or the delay bit, and possibly bits
   5 and 6 to carry additional information, like the delay bit and the
   round-trip loss bit (DT), or a two bits loss signal (QL or QR).

9.  Security Considerations

   Passive loss and delay observations have been a part of the network
   operations for a long time, so exposing loss and delay information to
   the network does not add new security concerns for protocols that are
   currently observable.

   In the absence of packet loss, Q and R bits signals do not provide
   any information that cannot be observed by simply counting packets
   transiting a network path.  In the presence of packet loss, Q and R
   bits will disclose the loss, but this is information about the
   environment and not the endpoint state.  The L bit signal discloses
   internal state of the protocol's loss detection machinery, but this
   state can often be gleamed by timing packets and observing congestion
   controller response.

   Hence, loss bits do not provide a viable new mechanism to attack data
   integrity and secrecy.

9.1.  Optimistic ACK Attack

   A defense against an Optimistic ACK Attack, described in
   [QUIC-TRANSPORT], involves a sender randomly skipping packet numbers
   to detect a receiver acknowledging packet numbers that have never
   been received.  The Q bit signal may inform the attacker which packet
   numbers were skipped on purpose and which had been actually lost (and
   are, therefore, safe for the attacker to acknowledge).  To use the Q
   bit for this purpose, the attacker must first receive at least an
   entire Q Block of packets, which renders the attack ineffective
   against a delay-sensitive congestion controller.

   A protocol that is more susceptible to an Optimistic ACK Attack with
   the loss signal provided by Q bit and uses a loss-based congestion
   controller, should shorten the current Q Block by the number of
   skipped packets numbers.  For example, skipping a single packet
   number will invert the square signal one outgoing packet sooner.

   Similar considerations apply to the R Bit, although a shortened R
   Block along with a matching skip in packet numbers does not
   necessarily imply a lost packet, since it could be due to a lost
   packet on the reverse path along with a deliberately skipped packet
   by the sender.

10.  Privacy Considerations

   To minimize unintentional exposure of information, loss bits provide
   an explicit loss signal - a preferred way to share information per
   [RFC8558].

   New protocols commonly have specific privacy goals, and loss
   reporting must ensure that loss information does not compromise those
   privacy goals.  For example, [QUIC-TRANSPORT] allows changing
   Connection IDs in the middle of a connection to reduce the likelihood
   of a passive observer linking old and new sub-flows to the same
   device.  A QUIC implementation would need to reset all counters when
   it changes the destination (IP address or UDP port) or the Connection
   ID used for outgoing packets.  It would also need to avoid
   incrementing Unreported Loss counter for loss of packets sent to a
   different destination or with a different Connection ID.

11.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.
