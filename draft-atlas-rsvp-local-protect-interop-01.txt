Abstract

   Routers implementing the local protection enhancements given in
   [draft-ietf-mpls-rsvp-lsp-tunnel-08.txt], whose usage is clarified in
   [draft-swallow-rsvp-bypass-label-01.txt], and routers implementing
   solely [draft-gan-fast-reroute-00.txt] do not interoperate to provide
   local protection.  Those routers which follow the guidelines given in
   this draft should be able to interoperate with either type of
   implementation.  The guidelines also specify how to support make-
   before-break with backup LSPs.

1. Introduction

   Routers may implement the local protection enhancements given in
   [RSVP-TE], whose usage is clarified in [BYPASS], but not implement
   [DETOUR].  Routers may also implement [DETOUR] without implementing
   the local protection enhancements given in [RSVP-TE].  These two sets
   of routers will not interoperate to provide local protection.

   This draft assumes that a router falls into one of the following
   three sets:

     A.  Implements both the local protection enhancements given in
         [RSVP-TE] and [DETOUR] as described in this draft.

     B.  Implements only [DETOUR].

     C.  Implements only the local protection enhancements given in
         [RSVP-TE], according to the guidelines in [BYPASS].

   The guidelines given in this draft should allow routers in set A to
   interoperate with either of the other two sets of routers, but not
   both.  A network with routers in set A and set B will be able to
   provide local protection.  A network with routers in set A and set C
   will be able to provide local protection.  A network that contains
   routers from both set B and set C will not be able to provide local
   protection in some cases involving paths with a mix of the two types
   of routers, irrespective of the presence or absence of routers from
   set A.

   This draft also describes a modification to identifying LSPs
   specified for Shared-Explicit which distinguish between primary and
   backup bandwidth reservations.  This is necessary to support make-
   before-break on backup tunnels; how to support make-before-break on
   backup tunnels is described.

   More details on handling PathErrs and resource preemption is
   provided.


2. Terminology

   PLR (Point-of-Local-Repair): Any node along the primary LSP's path is
   a potential PLR.  A node becomes an active PLR when it takes action
   to transfer traffic from the primary LSP to a backup tunnel when a
   failure is locally detected.  When discussed in examples, the
   specific potential PLR of interest is the node which originates the
   specific backup tunnel under discussion.

Internet Draft                                                 July 2001


   Backup Tunnel: A backup tunnel is logically created from the PLR to a
   merge node on the primary LSP's path; which specific merge node is
   used can vary between the backup LSPs contained in the backup tunnel.
   The backup tunnel can contain one or more backup LSPs for a given
   primary LSP.  The concept of a backup tunnel permits make-before-
   break for backup LSPs.

   Backup LSP: A backup LSP extends from its origin at the PLR to a
   specific merge node, where it rejoins the primary LSP.  A backup LSP
   is part of a Backup Tunnel.  There are three types of backup LSPs -
   simple, detour and unsignalled.

   Simple Backup LSP: A Simple Backup LSP is a backup LSP whose PATH
   message does not include the DETOUR object.  The ERO contains the
   selected backup path to the merge node and then an exact duplicate of
   the primary LSP's ERO from that merge node to the egress.

   Detour Backup LSP: A Detour Backup LSP is a backup LSP whose PATH
   message includes the DETOUR object.  The ERO simply contains the
   selected backup path to the merge node.

   Bypass Tunnel: A tunnel from the PLR of interest to a specific merge
   node through which traffic across unsignalled backup LSPs can be
   passed.  This is used as defined in [BYPASS].

   Unsignalled Backup LSP: An Unsignalled Backup LSP can only exist if
   there is an appropriate bypass tunnel.  This bypass tunnel is used so
   that the Unsignalled Backup LSP is logically one hop away from the
   merge node.  No RSVP signalling is done to create or indicate the
   existence of the Unsignalled Backup LSP.  The Unsignalled Backup LSP
   uses the label provided by the merge node, via the Label sub-object,
   to forward traffic to the merge node, as described in [BYPASS].

   Fully Protected: A primary LSP is considered to be fully protected
   when each potential PLR in its path has a current backup tunnel
   available.


3. Ingress Support

3.1 Requesting Local Protection

   The [DETOUR] and [BYPASS] propose different methods for the ingress
   to signal that an LSP desires local protection.  These methods are
   not mutually incompatible.  The ingress must both include the
   FAST_REROUTE object in the PATH message and set the two flags, "Label
   Recording desired" and "Local Protection desired", in the
   SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object[RSVP-TE].



Atlas et al.                                                    [Page 4]

Internet Draft                                                 July 2001


   By including the FAST_REROUTE object, any nodes on the primary LSP
   which implement [DETOUR] will know that the primary LSP requires
   protection.  By setting the "Local Protection desired" flag in the
   SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object, any nodes which implement [BYPASS] will
   know that the primary LSP requires protection.  The FAST_REROUTE
   object provides constraints on the backup tunnel; those constraints
   can be configured solely at the primary tunnel's ingress and can
   differ easily differ between primary LSPs.

   If the ingress sets the "Label Recording desired" flag in the
   SESSION_ATTRIBUTE, the resulting Label subobjects in the RRO permit
   those PLRs which implement [BYPASS] to create Unsignalled Backup
   LSPs.  If there are nodes in the primary LSP's path which do not
   understand Label subobjects and do not ignore the unrecognized
   subobjects, as they SHOULD according to [RSVP-TE], then the ingress
   should not set the "Label Recording desired" flag in the SESSION
   ATTRIBUTE.  If this flag is not set, the interoperability affected
   will be with routers which only support Unsignalled Backup LSPs.
   This must be a configured option at the ingress.  It is assumed that
   the network operator knows whether routers in the network support
   LRO, don't support but correctly ignore request for LRO, or handle
   the LRO in violation of the specification.


3.2 Detecting Protection Information

   The primary tunnel's ingress is responsible for determining when
   rerouting of the primary path is desirable.  For instance, if local
   protection is in use on the current primary LSP, it would be
   desirable to compute a new primary LSP.

   The ingress must also determine when to move from a current LSP to a
   new LSP, via make-before-break.  For instance, it will take time
   before a newly created primary LSP will be fully protected.  If the
   new primary LSP were to be created due to a configuration change or
   adaptation to network changes, then the ingress might wait to move
   traffic to the new primary LSP until that is fully protected.
   Alternatively, if the new primary LSP were to be created because
   local protection is in use on the current primary LSP, the ingress
   may move traffic immediately to the new primary LSP or it may wait
   until the new primary LSP is as locally protected along its path as
   the current primary LSP is.

   For both of the reasons above, the ingress must know what nodes along
   an LSP's path are currently providing local protection and which have
   that local protection in use.  The "Local protection available" and
   "Local protection in use" in the IPv4 address and IPv6 address
   subobjects of the RRO [RSVP-TE] provide the necessary information to



Atlas et al.                                                    [Page 5]

Internet Draft                                                 July 2001


   the ingress.  The ingress may be notified that local protection is in
   use via a PathErr message with an error code of "Notify"(25) and an
   error value of "Tunnel locally repaired"(3) by nodes implementing
   [BYPASS].

   Routers implementing only [DETOUR] without the local protection
   enhancements given in [RSVP-TE] may not set the "Local protection
   available" and "Local protection in use" flags in the IPv4 and IPv6
   address subobjects of the RRO.

   To permit the ingress behavior described early in this section, the
   ingress should be configured with information about which nodes
   implement only [DETOUR] and, therefore, do not support a means to
   indicate that local protection is available at that node.  Such nodes
   can be ignored at the ingress in any decision regarding whether the
   protection is fully available (it must be assumed that protection is
   available for any such node when any RSVP RESV arives).


4. PLR Behavior

   Once an ingress or midpoint node has determined that a given LSP is
   requesting local protection, that node, acting in the role of a PLR,
   must determine the link(s) and/or node(s) that the backup tunnel must
   avoid.  Then, the PLR must determine the backup path and merge node.
   Finally, the PLR must determine what type of backup LSP to use and
   create it.

   A link or node could fail for a variety of reasons.  Links for which
   failure may be correlated are determined through the use of Shared
   Risk Link Groups (SRLGs).  SRLGs may be signaled via [GMPLS IS-IS]
   and [GMPLS OSPF].  The PLR can determine what SRLGs are present
   through this signaling or through configuration at each node of all
   SRLGs in the entire network.

   Some routers may support only signaled SRLGs and therefore SRLG
   signaling must be originated.  Some routers may only support
   configured SRLGs and therefore cannot originate signaled SRLGs and
   therefore the ability to configure SRLGs for external links must be
   supported.


4.1 Selecting Backup LSP Type

   The PLR may decide to create a backup LSP either when it has received
   the primary LSP's PATH message or after it has received the primary
   LSP's RESV message.  The latter case is required if unsignalled
   backup paths are desirable.  The former case is reasonable if most



Atlas et al.                                                    [Page 6]

Internet Draft                                                 July 2001


   LSPs are expected to be created successfully and if the ERO is
   primarily strict hops, so that a reasonable merge node can be
   determined.

   To determine which type of backup LSP to create, the PLR must infer
   what type of routers share the local domain.  If the other routers
   implement [BYPASS], then either a simple backup LSP or an unsignalled
   backup LSP should be created.  If the other routers implement
   [DETOUR], then a detour backup LSP should be created.

   If the PLR is to create a backup LSP when it has received the primary
   LSP's PATH message, then the PLR must determine the type of backup
   LSP based upon the inferred type of the ingress.  If the primary's
   PATH message contains a FAST_REROUTE object, it is assumed that other
   routers will support the [DETOUR].  The PLR will attempt to create a
   detour backup LSP.  If no FAST_REROUTE object is found or if the
   detour creation is rejected, as indicated by a PathErr with the error
   code "Unknown object class", then a simple backup LSP can be
   attempted.  The latter case can only occur in a mixed network where
   the ingress supports [DETOUR] but a node along the selected backup
   path does not.  In this case, the backup LSP must be resignaled
   without a DETOUR object.

   When the PLR creates a backup LSP after it has received the primary
   LSP's RESV message, the decision as to backup LSP type is based upon
   inferring the behavior of the merge node.  If the merge node has
   recorded a label, via a subobject in the RRO, then the PLR can assume
   that the merge node implements [BYPASS] with the RSVP enhancements
   given in [RSVP-TE].  Otherwise the merge node is assumed to implement
   [DETOUR] and a detour backup LSP is signalled.  If the selected merge
   node does not support, or is assumed to not support, the DETOUR
   object, then a simple backup path can be used. Using this method, the
   PLR can provide the most efficient backup LSP feasible given the
   capabilites of the downstream LSRs.


4.2 Bypass Tunnels

   The use of the tunnel heirarchy described in [BYPASS] provides
   enhanced scalability for local protection.  The midpoint nodes along
   the active LSP of the bypass tunnel are aware of and reserve for only
   one LSP, but multiple backup LSPs can use the same bypass tunnel.

   This use of a label stack is not limited to the unsignalled backup
   LSPs discussed in [BYPASS].  It is also possible to have simple
   backup LSPs or detour backup LSPs be tunneled through a bypass
   tunnel.  To do this, the simple or detour backup LSP's PATH message
   must be sent through the bypass tunnel; it will emerge at the merge



Atlas et al.                                                    [Page 7]

Internet Draft                                                 July 2001


   node.  The backup path part of the ERO would simply be the merge
   node.  To support this, the merge node and the PLR must trust each
   other to provide legitimate RSVP messages.

   A bypass LSP may also be used by the PLR to avoid sending a DETOUR
   object through a node which does not support [DETOUR] to reach a
   merge node that does support [DETOUR] and does not support LRO.


4.3 Make-Before-Break on Backup Tunnels

   In supporting make-before-break on backup tunnels, the option of
   using a different LSP-ID is not available. As described in [RSVP-TE],
   when doing a make-before-break on a regular tunnel, the ingress will
   allocate a new LSP ID to be used when creating a new LSP.  Because
   the SESSION object of the current LSP and that of the new LSP are the
   same and Shared-Explicit (SE) is specified, resources will be shared.

   When signalling a backup LSP, the LSP ID used (sent in the
   SENDER_TEMPLATE and the FILTER_SPEC objects) is that of the primary
   LSP which the backup LSP is protecting.  The SESSION object used when
   signalling the backup LSP is the same as the SESSION object of the
   primary LSP.  This behavior is common in [BYPASS] and [DETOUR].


4.3.1 Shared-Explicit and Backup LSPs

   To properly support make-before-break on a backup tunnel, shared-
   explicit must be used on that backup tunnel.  However, if this were
   done simply based upon the SESSION object, as is specified in [RSVP-
   TE], then the backup LSPs and the primary LSPs would share resources.
   This is undesirable, as demonstrated by the following topology.

                   I---------J
                  /|         |
                /  |         |
              A----B    E----F----G
                   |   /|    |   /
                   |  / |    |  /
                   | /  |    | /
                   |/   |    |/
                   C----D----H

   Consider a primary LSP which goes A-B-C-D-E-F-G.  The backup LSP for
   E might go E-C-D-H-G.  In this case, both the primary LSP and the
   backup LSP traverse the link C-D in the same direction.  If the
   Shared-Explicit means that the primary LSP and backup LSP share
   resources, then only the maximum of the primary LSP's bandwidth and



Atlas et al.                                                    [Page 8]

Internet Draft                                                 July 2001


   the backup LSP's bandwidth would be reserved on C-D.  This would mean
   that insufficient resources are reserved in the event of a failure of
   link E-F.

   Consider if the backup LSP at B is B-I-J-F.  If the link B-C failed
   and A tried to create a new primary LSP, the new LSP would have to
   travel across the I-J link.  It is possible that the link I-J has
   only enough bandwidth for either the backup LSP or the new primary
   LSP.

   From these two cases, it is clear that, backup LSPs cannot share
   bandwidth with the primary LSP that they are protecting and that
   backup LSPs must share bandwidth with primary LSPs that they are not
   protecting.  All primary LSPs must share bandwidth with each other,
   as described in [RSVP-TE], to permit make-before-break.

   To resolve this requires that the "LSP ID" of the FILTER_SPEC (or
   SENDER_TEMPLATE) be considered when determining whether LSPs should
   share resources once Shared-Explicit is specified.  If the LSP IDs in
   two different RESV (or PATH) messages are different, then they can
   share resources.  If the LSP IDs are the same, then they cannot share
   resources.  This does not result in transitive sharing.

              i) Backup LSPs for LSP n
             ii) Primary LSP n
            iii) Primary LSP k
             iv) Backup LSPs for LSP k

   Consider the above four groups of LSPs.  (i) can share with (iii) and
   (iv).  (ii) can share with (iii) and (iv).  (iii) can share with (i)
   and (ii).  (iv) can share with (i) and (ii).

   A router following these guidelines should implement this enhancement
   of the rules for shared-explicit. If all backup LSPs always have zero
   bandwidth reserved, then this enhancement is not needed.
   Constraining all backup LSPs to use zero bandwidth is a severe
   restriction and unacceptable in some situations.


4.3.2 Make-Before-Break with Sender Addresses

   The prior subsection clarifies how Shared-Explicit can be specified
   for backup LSPs.  The Shared-Explicit is required for make-before-
   break, as explained in [RSVP-TE].  The other piece necessary for
   make-before-break is a way of distinguishing the current backup LSP
   from the new backup LSP.  For a regular TE tunnel, this is done by
   changing the LSP ID.  However, the LSP ID is used to associate the
   backup tunnel with a specific primary LSP.  Therefore, the LSP ID



Atlas et al.                                                    [Page 9]

Internet Draft                                                 July 2001


   cannot be changed to do a make-before-break on the backup tunnel.

   The other content of the SENDER_TEMPLATE (and FILTER_SPEC) is the
   "IPv4 (IPv6) tunnel sender address".  As suggested in [BYPASS], the
   PLR will fill out this address with one of the PLR's addresses for
   simple backup LSPs.  A router implementing [DETOUR] may not modify
   this address in the SENDER_TEMPLATE; when a PLR, this router will put
   the PLR's address in the "Source ID" field in the DETOUR object.

   Any router which can distinguish a backup LSP from a primary LSP must
   do so based upon either the "IPv4 (IPv6) tunnel sender address" in
   the SENDER_TEMPLATE (and FILTER_SPEC) or upon the "Source ID" in the
   DETOUR object.  Therefore, to signal two different backup LSPs from
   the same PLR for the same primary LSP, the PLR must use different IP
   addresses, which are put into the SENDER_TEMPLATE and/or the DETOUR
   object.

   To effect a reroute or a bandwidth change on a backup tunnel, the PLR
   picks one of its IP addresses which is different from that used for
   the current backup LSP in that backup tunnel and which is different
   from that used for primary LSP.  Then the PLR signals the new backup
   LSP and proceeds with a make-before-break as described in [RSVP-TE].

   To support make-before-break on backup tunnels in this manner, the
   PLR must have ownership of two distinct IP addresses.  If the PLR is
   also ingress, then it requires a third distinct IP address, which it
   uses when signalling primary LSPs.  Only the router ID needs to be
   routable.  All three addresses MUST be unique within the MPLS domain,
   and MUST be globally unique if chosen from public address space.


4.4 Catching ResvTears and Appropriate PathErrs

   The PLR behavior described in this section should only start after
   the primary LSP is known to be successfully created.  If the backup
   tunnel is created after a RESV is received for the primary LSP, then
   it suffices to check whether the backup tunnel is up.  If the backup
   tunnel is created when a PATH message is received for the primary
   LSP, then it is necessary that the backup tunnel be up and that a
   RESV has been received for the primary LSP.

   Under those circumstances, the PLR must not forward ResvTear
   [DETOUR].  Instead, when a ResvTear is received, the PLR should move
   traffic to the backup tunnel, if it is up, and then not propagate the
   ResvTear upstream towards the ingress.

   The PLR must also handle certain PathErrs similarly to how it handles
   ResvTears.  If the PLR receives a PathErr with an error code of



Atlas et al.                                                   [Page 10]

   "Policy Control failure", as happens when the primary LSP is
   preempted, or a PathErr with an error code of "Routing Problem" and a
   sub-code of "No route available toward destination", as may happen
   when a link or node fails, then the PLR should similarly move traffic
   to the backup tunnel, if it is up, and then not propagate the PathErr
   upstream towards the ingress.

   According to [RSVP-TE], the PathErr with the code "Policy Control
   failure" occurs when the primary LSP to be preempted as the result of
   another LSP being setup.  This LSP failure caused by resource
   preemption cannot be detected at the ingress based upon IGP (IS-IS or
   OSPF) information.  Therefore the ingress must be explicitly notified
   if the PLR receives this type of PathErr and does not propagate it
   further upstream toward the ingress; if so, the PLR should send a
   PathErr with an error code of "Notify" and an error value of "Tunnel
   locally repaired".


4.5 Handling Resource Preemption

   It is possible for a primary LSP to have its resources preempted, due
   to the arrival and admission of another LSP.  If the PLR is making
   this determination and has a backup tunnel, which is currently up,
   for that primary LSP, then the PLR should move traffic from the
   primary LSP to the backup tunnel and then send a PathErr with an
   error code of "Notify" and an error value of "Tunnel locally
   repaired". When this type of PathErr is received at the ingress, the
   ingress should reroute the tunnel onto a new primary LSP using make-
   before-break.


5. Merge Node Behavior

5.1 Label Space

   To support all types of backup LSPs, a merge node must use a
   platform-wide (aka global) label for an LSP which has requested local
   protection.

   If an implemention does not normally provide platform-wide labels for
   unprotected RSVP-TE LSPs, additional behavior should be defined to
   handle an LSP which changes from requesting local protection to not
   and vice versa.  It is not recommended to change this attribute of a
   TE tunnel without doing a reroute.


5.2 Ignore Path Tears Unless From Ingress

                   /--F----G----H--\
                  /   |    |    |   \
                 A----B----C----D----E

                     Primary LSP:  A-B-C-D-E
             Bypass Tunnel's LSP:  B-F-G-H-D

   In the above example, consider what occurs when the link B-C fails.
   B will start using its unsignalled backup path, which goes through
   the bypass tunnel, and C will send a PathTear to D.  If D acts upon
   the PathTear received from C, then D would tear down the remainder of
   the primary (D-E) which is required to deliver traffic sent over the
   unsignalled backup path to the egress. Because B is using an
   unsignalled backup path, D cannot determine that it is a merge node.
   This example indicates that PathTears must be ignored for primary
   LSPs which request local protection.

   However, ignoring all PathTears means that the ingress cannot destroy
   the primary LSP.  This unfortunate loss of capability can be remedied
   by examination of the PathTear message.  If the PathTear's IP
   packet's source IP address matches the "IPv4 (IPv6) tunnel sender
   address" in the SENDER_TEMPLATE object, then the PathTear came from
   the LSP's ingress and should not be ignored.


5.3 Simple and Detour Backup LSPs

   A router can determine that it is the merge node of either a simple
   backup LSP or a detour backup LSP.  In the latter case, the DETOUR
   object contains one of the merge node's IP addresses.  In the former
   case, if the matching primary LSP is known at the router and the ERO
   in the simple backup LSP's PATH message matches the ERO in the
   primary LSP's PATH message, then the node is the merge node.  If the
   router is the merge node for a simple backup LSP, then the simple
   backup LSP's PATH message is not sent all the way to the egress, but
   is instead merged to the primary LSP and handled at the merge node.
   The merge node is responsible for constructing a RESV based upon the
   primary LSP's RESV, including the RRO, and sending that.

   As long as a router knows that it is the merge node for an existing
   backup LSP, the router will not tear down the primary LSP to the
   egress.


5.4 ResvTears

   When a router receives a ResvTear for an LSP and it is not a PLR for
   that LSP, then the router should propagate the ResvTear towards the

   LSP's ingress.  For each backup LSP where the router is the merge
   node, the ResvTear should also be propagated along the backup LSP
   towards the backup LSP's ingress, a PLR.

   This propagation clearly works for simple and detour backup LSPs.
   For unsignalled backup LSPs, the router does not know it is a merge
   node.

               A----B----C----D
               |    |    |    |
               E----F----G----H

               Primary LSP: A-B-C-D
               Bypass Tunnel 1: A-E-F-G-C
               Bypass Tunnel 2: B-F-G-H-D
               Bypass Tunnel 3: C-G-H-D

   In the above example, consider the behavior when router D fails.  C
   will determine that both the primary LSP and bypass tunnel 3 are
   down.  Therefore, C will send a ResvTear to B.  B will determine that
   bypass tunnel 2 is down and that the primary LSP has been torn down,
   due to receiving the ResvTear.  Therefore, B will send a ResvTear to
   A.  A will determine that the primary LSP is down and will switch to
   using an unsignalled backup path through bypass tunnel 1.  Bypass
   tunnel 1 is still up.

   A will send a PATH message for the primary LSP through bypass tunnel
   1 to C.  C will determine the the next hop in the PATH's ERO is
   unreachable and send a PathErr with error code "Routing Problem" and
   a sub-code of "No route available toward destination".  When A
   receives this PathErr, A will determine that the unsignalled backup
   LSP is no longer available and will propagate that error upstream.


6. Security Considerations

   This draft provides guidlelines for the use of existing protocol
   mechanisms defined in [RSVP-TE], [BYPASS], and [DETOUR] which are
   designed to maximize interoperability.  No new protocol is defined.
   The usage or existing protocol described here does not introduce any
   additional security risks.
