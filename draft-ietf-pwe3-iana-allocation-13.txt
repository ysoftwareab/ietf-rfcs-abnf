1. Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119


2. IANA Considerations

   Unless otherwise noted in this document, the value of 0 is reserved,
   and MUST not be used.


2.1. MPLS Pseudowire Type

   IANA needs to set up a registry of "MPLS Pseudowire Type". These are
   15-bit values. PW Type values 1 through 30 are specified in this
   document, PW Type values 31 through 1024 are to be assigned by IANA,
   using the "Expert Review" policy defined in [RFC2434]. PW Type values
   1025 through 4096, 0, and 32767 are to be allocated using the IETF
   consensus policy defined in [RFC2434].  PW Type values 4097 through
   32766 are reserved for vendor proprietary extensions and are to be
   assigned by IANA, using the "First Come First Served" policy defined
   in RFC2434. A Pseudowire Type description of up to 65 characters is
   required for any assignment from this registry.

2.2. Interface Parameters Sub-TLV type

   IANA needs to set up a registry of "Pseudowire Interface Parameter
   Sub-TLV types". These are 8 bit values. Sub-TLV types 1 through 12
   are specified in this document. Sub-TLV types 13 through 64 are to be
   assigned by IANA, using the "Expert Review" policy defined in
   RFC2434. Sub-TLV types 65 through 127, 0, and 255 are to be allocated
   using the IETF consensus policy defined in [RFC2434].  Sub-TLV types
   values 128 through 254 are reserved for vendor proprietary extensions

   and are to be assigned by IANA, using the "First Come First Served"
   policy defined in RFC2434.

   Any assignments requested from this registry require a description up
   to 54 characters.

   For each allocation a length field MUST also be specified as follows:
     - A decimal integer
     - Text as follows:"up to X", where X is a decimal integer
     - Up to 3 different decimal integers.

   Note that the Length field is defined as the length of the Sub-TLV
   including the Sub-TLV type and length field itself.


2.3. Attachment Identifiers

2.3.1. Attachment Individual Identifier Type

   IANA needs to set up a registry of "Attachment Individual Identifier
   (AII) Type". These are 8-bit values. AII Type value 1 is defined in
   this document.  AII Type values 2 through 64 are to be assigned by
   IANA using the "Expert Review" policy defined in RFC2434. AII Type
   values 65 through 127, 0, and 255 are to be allocated using the IETF
   consensus policy defined in [RFC2434].  AII types values 128 through
   254 are reserved for vendor proprietary extensions and are to be

2.3.2. Attachment Group Identifier (AGI) Type

   IANA needs to set up a registry of "Attachment Group Identifier (AGI)
   Type".  These are 8-bit values. AGI Type value 1 is defined in this
   document.  AGI Type values 2 through 64 are to be assigned by IANA
   using the "Expert Review" policy defined in RFC2434. AGI Type values
   65 through 127, 0, and 255 are to be allocated using the IETF
   consensus policy defined in [RFC2434].  AGI types values 128 through
   254 are reserved for vendor proprietary extensions and are to be

3. Security Considerations

   used to carry the encapsulated packets across the network.  Each such
   protocol may have its own set of security issues, but those issues
   are not affected by the identifiers specified herein.
