   Problem Statement for Shared Unified Policy Automation (SUPA) 
           draft-karagiannis-supa-problem-statement-00

Abstract

   As modern network management applications grow in scale 
   and complexity, their demands and requirements on the supporting 
   communication network increase. 
   In particular, network operators are challenged to create a 
   simplified view of their network infrastructure and help service 
   developers on using and programming this simplified view rather than 
   manipulating individual devices. In this context, providing service 
   developers with a set of standard interfaces to configure and set 
   policies on the network is essential. 
   This document describes what has to be addressed in order to equip 
   service providers with standardized application-based interfaces used 
   to expose and define policies and a simplified view of network 
   infrastructure.

1.  Introduction

   Network operators are faced with networks of increasing size and 
   complexity while trying to improve their quality and availability, as 
   more and more services depend on them. Programmatic ways to configure 
   networks, often called software-defined, are considered by many 
   network operators in order to shift the balance in their favor.
 
   Currently, the separation of development and operation of network 
   technologies leads to slow deployment of network functions/devices 
   and poor user experiences. 

   Automating the way of exposing a view of the network to applications 
   may provide significant improvements in configuration agility, error 
   detection and uptime for operators.

Internet-Draft          SUPA Problem Statement           September 2014

   However the real value behind central configuration schemes lies 
   within the possible simplification through simplified models  
   provided by such systems to applications and network zervices running 
   above them (on the so-called northbound side). Well-designed 
   simplified models are able to provide a wide range of granularity for 
   various applications and network services needs, from the lower-level 
   physical network to high-level application services.
   
   1.1 Motivation

   Although several organizations outside of the IETF have defined 
   various schemes for the configuration of network devices and specific 
   network controllers, none of them offer a vendor-neutral standardized 
   way for applications and network services to transmit their needs to 
   controllers. The SUPA (Shared Unified Policy Automation) working 
   group will work on the definition of such as standardized interface 
   for applications and network services to communicate with network 
   controllers of all types.
   The specification of the interface towards end user apllications is 
   initially not in the scope of SUPA. In particular, as starting point, 
   SUPA will only focus on network services, which are enhanced 
   Operational Support System (OSS) like services that help a 
   communication service provider to monitor, control, analyze and 
   manage a communication network. The systems that are runniung such 
   network services are denoted in this document as Network Service 
   Systems (NSS).
   Each network service can be represented by a classified application 
   based POLICY model, since it can model the group of demands which are 
   SHARED and UNIFIED and are coming from a bundle of applications that 
   impose similar requirements on the communication network. 

   Although some IETF working groups have started work relating to the 
   description of various topologies such as I2RS (L3and routing 
   topologies), ALTO (cost maps), SFC (service chain), none of these 
   groups aim at offering truly generic topology models for the standard 
   northbound interface. An example of a YANG based data model for 
   network topologies is provided in 
   [ID. draft-contreras-supa-yang-network-topo].

   SUPA will work on defining interfaces based on the concept of network 
   graph, an entity describing an arbitrary topology of nodes and links 
   at any level of granularity. Such a graph may describe, for example, 
   a physical topology, a service topology or the relationships between 
   datacenters. Any network topology data models or policy models that 
   have been defined (or are being defined) within the IETF will be 
   reused in SUPA as much as possible.
   In addition to the above, policies may be defined and applied to a 
   network graph. These application based policies are actions or 
   constraints generated by network service systems. They are then 
   mapped from the network graph instance into specific network 
   management policies toward network components. Such application based 
   demands are of the following types:

            *) Configuration requests:
                 o) Dynamically configure e.g., a L3VPN inter-connecting 
                    DCs, a service topology, the relationships between 
                    datacentres
            *) Data plane requests:
                 o) Traffic flow steering
                 o) Traffic flow prioritizing
                 o) Encapsulate/de-capsulate a traffic flow
                 o) Block or admit a traffic flow
             *) Control plane / Routing plane requests:
                 o) Change the routing state on a service or 
                    network function

   In this context, network services can be used to provide the required 
   configuration and application programming interfaces to such service 
   developers. Subsequently, a network service can use the application 
   based demands and possibly update its associated network service 
   attributes. 

   For each network service instance a network graph needs to be 
   generated and maintained. 

   The up-to-date network graph needs to be communicated 
   between the network service systems and the network 
   management and controlling systems. The attributes of the network 
   graph need to be mapped into specific network management policies, 
   i.e., device level configuration models.

   The main goal of SUPA is to provide a way for applications and 
   for network services to specify SHARED application based POLICIES to 
   the network infrastructure using a simplified view of the network. 
   This can be realized by: (1) modeling the network infrastructure as 
   a simplified network graph using a modeling language such as YANG 
   [RFC6020], [RFC6991], (2) transporting model instances either using 
   NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [ID.draft-ietf-netconf-restconf] and  
   (3) providing guidelines on AUTOMATICALLY mapping policies to 
   attributes of the network graphs. Figure 1 shows the SUPA goal and 
   scope. 

   This document is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the 
   terminology. Section 3 provides a brief overview of the use cases 
   associated with SUPA. The requirements/objectives are provided in 
   Section 4. Section 5 provides the security considerations. The IANA 
   considerations are given in Section 6. Section 7 gives the 
   acknowledgements and Section 8 lists the used references.

   network management policies and it describes the configuration 
   details at the device level.

   Network service dependencies: dependencies between different service 
   functions/nodes.

   applications is out of the scope of this document. 

   Network configuration model: provides a declarative configuration of 
   the network 

   Network topology model: describes the topology of a multi-layer   
   network.

   Network graph: an entity describing an arbitrary topology of nodes 
   and links at any level of granularity. Such a graph 
   may describe, for example, a physical topology, a L2 network, a 
   service topology or the relationships between datacenters.

   Network element: a physical entity or a virtual entity that can be 
   locally managed and operated.


3.  Use Cases

   This section briefly describes the use cases that are associated with 
   different types of network services. The detailed description of 
   these use cases is provided in other Internet draft(s).

3.1 Distributed Data Center 

   A large-scale IDC (Inter Data Center) operator provides server 
   hosting, bandwidth, and value-added services to enterprises and ISPs,  
   and has more than 10 data centers and more than 1Tbs bandwidth in a 
   capital city. In current IDC network, traffic is routed by 
   configuring policy routes and adjusting routes prioritization to 
   choose an outgoing link. This type of static provisioning comes with 
   high costs and poor operability. Furthermore, the link bandwidth 
   resources in the data centers are not efficiently utilized.  

   Services usually do not have consistent bandwidth requirements at
   all times of a day, e.g. video ISP usually require more

Internet-Draft          SUPA Problem Statement           September 2014

   bandwidth at non-working hours but require less bandwidth at working
   hours.  Some customers have relative high QoS requirement for their
   services, e.g. IM (Instant Messaging).  Static bandwidth and QoS 
   provisioning for all the customers and services is not reasonable and 
   not a cost-effective solution.
   SUPA can be used to request the optimization of the traffic paths 
   dynamically and  have the ability to request the load balance between 
   data centers and links, and direct customer traffic via network 
   management policies (e.g., models, software programs routines) based 
   on customer grade and QoS requirements.  A detailed description of 
   this use case is provided in [ID.draft-cheng-supa-ddc-use-cases].

3.2 Mobile Networks

   GiLAN is another important application of network function 
   virtualization. In mobile core networks, it is preferable that QoS 
   provisioning and network function requirements are different for 
   subscribers with different profiles. In such scenarios, specialized 
   network services such as BSS/OSS can send application based demands 
   to a policy decision point, which further map these application based  
   demands to GiLAN specific policies, and realize 
   the required QoS and with appropriate network functions, for example, 
   for dynamic path reconfiguration.

   A detailed description of this use case is provided in 
   [ID.draft-huang-aponf-use-cases].

   4. Requirements/Objectives

   The requirements/objectives that need to be supported by the SUPA 
   methods, models and protocol solutions are the following ones:

   Work items for SUPA include:
 
   o) The definition of a standardized model for a network graph, using 
      YANG. This model may be used to describe topologies at any 
      functional layer, from physical networks to network services. 
      Any network topology data models or policy models that have been 
      defined (or are being defined) within the IETF will be reused in 
      SUPA as much as possible.

   o) The definition and standardization of a number of basic policy and 
      data models using network graphs. These might include, but are not 
      limited to L3VPNs, datacenters, traffic engineering, 
      implementation of IPv6 transition mechanism and their enforcement 
      to users.  

   o) Guidelines on how to use NETCONF (or RESTCONF) authentication and 
      authorization mechanisms to achieve protection and isolation

     o) Guidelines for automatic mapping policies to attributes of the 
        network graphs.

   The following items are out of the SUPA scope:
   o) specification of the network management and controlling policies 
      and their associated device configuration models

5.  Security Considerations

   Security is a key aspect of any protocol that allows state
   installation and extracting of detailed configuration states.  More
   investigation remains to fully define the security requirements, such
   as authorization and authentication levels. SUPA document how to use 
   either the NETCONF or RESTCONF authentication and authorization 
   mechanisms to achieve necessary security protection and isolation

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
