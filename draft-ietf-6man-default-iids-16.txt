          Recommendation on Stable IPv6 Interface Identifiers
                    draft-ietf-6man-default-iids-16

Abstract

   This document changes the recommended default IID generation scheme
   for cases where SLAAC is used to generate a stable IPv6 address.  It
   recommends using the mechanism specified in RFC7217 in such cases,
   and recommends against embedding stable link-layer addresses in IPv6
   Interface Identifiers.  It formally updates RFC2464, RFC2467,
   RFC2470, RFC2491, RFC2492, RFC2497, RFC2590, RFC3146, RFC3572,
   RFC4291, RFC4338, RFC4391, RFC5072, and RFC5121.  This document does
   not change any existing recommendations concerning the use of
   temporary addresses as specified in RFC 4941.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC4862] specifies Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) for
   IPv6 [RFC2460], which typically results in hosts configuring one or
   more "stable" addresses composed of a network prefix advertised by a
   local router, and an Interface Identifier (IID) [RFC4291] that
   typically embeds a stable link-layer address (e.g., an IEEE LAN MAC
   address).

   In some network technologies and adaptation layers, the use of an IID
   based on a link-layer address may offer some advantages.  For
   example, the IP-over-IEEE802.15.4 standard in [RFC6775] allows for
   compression of IPv6 addresses when the IID is based on the underlying
   link-layer address.

   The security and privacy implications of embedding a stable link-
   layer address in an IPv6 IID have been known for some time now, and
   are discussed in great detail in [RFC7721].  They include:

   o  Network activity correlation

   o  Location tracking

   o  Address scanning

   o  Device-specific vulnerability exploitation

Internet-Draft            Default Interface-IDs           September 2016


   More generally, the reuse of identifiers that have their own
   semantics or properties across different contexts or scopes can be
   detrimental for security and privacy
   [I-D.gont-predictable-numeric-ids].  In the case of traditional
   stable IPv6 IIDs, some of the security and privacy implications are
   dependent on the properties of the underlying link-layer addresses
   (e.g., whether the link-layer address is ephemeral or randomly
   generated), while other implications (e.g., reduction of the entropy
   of the IID) depend on the algorithm for generating the IID itself.
   In standardized recommendations for stable IPv6 IID generation meant
   to achieve particular security and privacy properties, it is
   therefore necessary to recommend against embedding stable link-layer
   addresses in IPv6 IIDs.

   Furthermore, some popular IPv6 implementations have already deviated
   from the traditional stable IID generation scheme to mitigate the
   aforementioned security and privacy implications [Microsoft].

   As a result of the aforementioned issues, this document changes the
   recommended default IID generation scheme for generating stable IPv6
   addresses with SLAAC to that specified in [RFC7217], and recommends
   against embedding stable link-layer addresses in IPv6 Interface
   Identifiers, such that the aforementioned issues are mitigated.  That
   is, this document simply replaces the default algorithm that is
   recommended to be employed when generating stable IPv6 IIDs.

   NOTE:  [RFC4291] defines the "Modified EUI-64 format" for IIDs.
      Appendix A of [RFC4291] then describes how to transform an IEEE
      EUI-64 identifier, or an IEEE 802 48-bit MAC address from which an
      EUI-64 identifier is derived, into an IID in the Modified EUI-64
      format.

   In a variety of scenarios, addresses that remain stable for the
   lifetime of a host's connection to a single subnet, are viewed as
   desirable.  For example, stable addresses may be viewed as beneficial
   for network management, event logging, enforcement of access control,
   provision of quality of service, or for server or routing interfaces.
   Similarly, stable addresses (as opposed to temporary addresses
   [RFC4941]) allow for long-lived TCP connections, and are also usually
   desirable when performing server-like functions (i.e., receiving
   incoming connections).

   The recommendations in this document apply only in cases where
   implementations otherwise would have configured a stable IPv6 IID
   containing a link layer address.  For example, this document does not
   change any existing recommendations concerning the use of temporary
   addresses as specified in [RFC4941], nor do the recommendations apply
   to cases where SLAAC is employed to generate non-stable IPv6



Gont, et al.             Expires March 29, 2017                 [Page 3]

   addresses (e.g. by embedding a link-layer address that is
   periodically randomized), nor does it introduce any new requirements
   regarding when stable addresses are to be configured.  Thus, the
   recommendations in this document simply improve the security and
   privacy properties of stable addresses.

2.  Terminology

   Stable address:
      An address that does not vary over time within the same network
      (as defined in [RFC7721]).

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Generation of IPv6 Interface Identifiers with SLAAC

   Nodes SHOULD implement and employ [RFC7217] as the default scheme for
   generating stable IPv6 addresses with SLAAC.  A link layer MAY also
   define a mechanism for stable IPv6 address generation that is more
   efficient and does not address the security and privacy
   considerations discussed in Section 1.  The choice of whether to
   enable the security- and privacy-preserving mechanism or not SHOULD
   be configurable in such a case.

   By default, nodes SHOULD NOT employ IPv6 address generation schemes
   that embed a stable link-layer address in the IID.  In particular,
   this document RECOMMENDS that nodes do not generate stable IIDs with
   the schemes specified in [RFC2464], [RFC2467], [RFC2470], [RFC2491],
   [RFC2492], [RFC2497], [RFC2590], [RFC3146], [RFC3572], [RFC4338],
   [RFC4391], [RFC5121], and [RFC5072].

4.  Future Work

   At the time of this writing, the mechanisms specified in the
   following documents might require updates to be fully compatible with
   the recommendations in this document:

   o  "Compression Format for IPv6 Datagrams over IEEE 802.15.4-Based
      Networks" [RFC6282]

   o  "Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 802.15.4 Networks"
      [RFC4944]

   o  "Neighbor Discovery Optimization for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless
      Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs)"[RFC6775]

   o  "Transmission of IPv6 Packets over ITU-T G.9959 Networks" [RFC7428]

   Future revisions or updates of these documents should take the issues
   of privacy and security mentioned in Section 1 and explain any design
   and engineering considerations that lead to the use of stable IIDs
   based on a node's link-layer address.

5.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA registries within this document.  The RFC-Editor
   can remove this section before publication of this document as an
   RFC.

6.  Security Considerations

   This recommends against the (default) use of predictable Interface
   Identifiers in IPv6 addresses.  It recommends [RFC7217] as the
   default scheme for generating IPv6 stable addresses with SLAAC, such
   that the security and privacy issues of IIDs that embed stable link-
   layer addresses are mitigated.
