Internet-Draft               Geopriv Policy                February 2004


1. Introduction

   Location information needs to be protected against unauthorized
   access to preserve privacy of the owner of the location information.
   The Geopriv working group has defined a protocol-independent model
   for access to geographic information. The model includes a Location
   Generator (LG) that produces Location Information (LI), a Location
   Server (LS) that authorizes access to LI, a location recipient (LR)
   that requests and receives information, and a Rulemaker (RM) that
   provides policy rules to the LS which enforce access control policies
   on access to a target.

   Two policy namespaces have been defined. The first basic rule set [7]
   can restrict how long the receiver can retain the information and it
   can prohibit any further distribution of the information. It does not
   allow to customize information to specific receivers, for example.
   This document describes an enhanced rule set that provides richer
   constraints on the distribution of the Location Objects (LOs). We
   assume that a basic location object [7] can contain a reference to
   additional rule sets.

   We refer to any entity that uses the rules in this document to
   restrict the retention or distribution of information as a Rule
   Enforcer (RE). Typically, these are LS and LR. A rule set allows the
   RE to enforce access restrictions on location data, including
   prohibiting any dissemination to particular individuals or during
   particular times. The RM can also stipulate that only certain parts
   of the location object are distributed to recipients or that the
   resolution of parts of the location object is limited.

   The abstract sequence of operations used in Geopriv can roughly be
   described as follows. The LS receives either a query for location
   information of a particular Target, via the using protocol. The using
   protocol provides the identity of the requestor, either at the time
   of the query or subscription to the location information. The
   authenticated identity of the LR, together with other information
   provided by the using protocol or generally available to the server,
   is then used for searching through the rule set. All matching rules
   are combined according to a merging algorithm described in [8]. The
   resulting rule is applied to the location data, yielding a possibly
   modified location object that is delivered to the location recipient.

   Note that the protocols used to query location information (between
   LS and LR), update policies at the LS and the protocol between the LG
   to LS and from LS to LR do not have to be the same. Geopriv or this
   document does not mandate a specific protocol for any of them.

   This document integrates into and extends the framework defined in



Schulzrinne, et al.     Expires August 16, 2004                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft               Geopriv Policy                February 2004


   [8]. That document provides an abstract authorization framework for
   expressing policy rules. As specified there, each such rule consists
   of a 'conditions', an 'actions', and a 'transformations' part.
   Conditions determine under which circumstances the LS is permitted to
   perform 'actions' (e.g., subscription to a service).
   'Transformations' implement a mechanism to optionally modify
   information elements returned to the requestor (e.g., to reduce the
   granularity of location information). The term 'transformation' is
   also known as 'provisional action'.

   The Geopriv policy markup language introduced by the schema in
   section Section 10 extends the common policy markup language (see
   [8]) by introducing new members of the 'condition' and
   'transformation' substitution groups defined there. To express civil
   location information, it makes use of the schema in section 2.2.3 of
   [5] that defines the 'civilAddress' complex type.

2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].

   This document reuses the terminology of [3]. This section assists in
   the alignment between the terminology defined in [8] and Geopriv.

   PT - Presentity / Target: Geopriv uses the term Target to identify
      the identity of which location information is required.

   RM - Rule Maker: The entity RM corresponds to the Geopriv Rulemaker.

   PS - (Authorization) Policy Server: The PS corresponds to the
      Location Server (LS) in the Geopriv terminology.

   WR - Watcher / Recipient: The WR represents the Location Recipient
      (LR) in the Geopriv terminology.

   An 'authorization policy' is given by a 'rule set'. A 'rule set'
   contains an unordered list of 'rules'. A 'rule' has a 'conditions',
   an 'actions' and a 'transformations' part.

   The term 'permission' indicates the action and transformation
   components of a 'rule'.

   The terms 'authorization policy', 'policy' and 'rule set' are used
   interchangable.

   The terms 'authorization policy rule', 'policy rule' and 'rule' are
   used interchangable.

   The term 'using protocol' is defined in [3]. It refers to the
   protocol which is used to request access to and to return privacy
   sensitive data items.

3. Basic Data Model and Processing

   As the Geopriv policy markup language defined in section Section 10
   extends the common policy markup language in [8], this document
   completely adopts the basic data model as introduced in section 6 of
   [8].

4. Rule Transport

   We make no assumption as to how rules are conveyed to entities within
   the network. Purely as examples, we below describe a few plausible
   options. None of the rule elements depend on the properties of how
   rule sets are conveyed to an LS or LR. Mechanisms may allow partial
   updates of rule sets. A partial update is an update which modifies
   only parts of the rule set in contrast to a full update. To simplify
   such partial updates, each rule is equipped with an identifier (see
   [8]).

   Transaction semantics for policy rule update is not required since
   'permit only' and 'additive permissions' properties have to be used.
   These properties also prevent inconsistency during concurrent query
   and update operations.

4.1 HTTP

   A rule set could be uploaded to the LS via an HTTP POST operation or
   more fully-featured WEBDAV. Each rule could be modeled as a single
   'file', with the rule identifier as a file name. (Since multiple
   rules may have the LR identity in the condition part of the rule, the
   LR identity cannot be used.) One example of this approach includes
   XCAP [6].

   The rule set can also be referenced from within a location object.
   The attribute 'ruleset-reference' specified in Section 2.2.2 of [7]
   contains an URI that indicates where a rule set related to this
   object can be found. The URI MAY alternatively use the CID URI scheme
   in which case it MUST denote a MIME body carried with the Location
   Object by the using protocol.

4.2 SIP Message Body

   The rule set can be carried, as a separate MIME message body, in the
   SIP message that conveys location information from a LG (a SIP UAC)
   via an LS (a SIP proxy) to an LR (a SIP UAS). The rule set would then
   govern the behavior expected of the LR.

4.3 Location Object

   The rule set can be carried in LOs in two ways: by reference and by
   value. In any case the 'ruleset-reference' attribute inside the LO
   [7] points to the location of the rules. The LG or the LS can attach
   the rule set (or a pointer to it) to the location object.

   One of the transformations of the rule set is the removal of the rule
   set described here before further transmission. Only the whole rule

Internet-Draft               Geopriv Policy                February 2004


   set can be removed and not individual elements (for example some
   conditions). Before transmitting the rules to the LR the rule set
   SHOULD be removed since the rule set might disclose prefences of the
   rule maker which entities to trust and to which other entities no
   trust is available. Revealing this information might have neative
   implication for the RM itself. The RM is, however, in the position to
   prevent disclosure of these rules by enforcing the necessary steps.

5. Securing the Location Object

   The Geopriv requirements draft [3] addresses the minimal security
   protection required for the LO: Mutual end-point authentication, data
   object integrity, data object confidentiality and replay protection.
   As proposed in [5] S/MIME SHOULD be used. Protection for the LO also
   includes an attached rule set.

   Protection is likely to be necessary against adversaries who
   eavesdrop on the communication between the LS and the LR or the LG
   and the LS, who tamper with the LO or who replay previously recorded
   LOs. Securing the communication between RM and LS depends on the
   protocol which is used to perform the desired actions (e.g., https).
   The communication between the LG and the LS can also be secured using
   channel security.

   If the LO is integrity and confidentiality-protected then the
   receiving entity (LS or LR) has to be able to decrypt and to verify
   the LO. Since the policy rules described in this document allow the
   modification of the LO (via granularity reduction or by setting
   flags), it is not possible to forward the LO without reapplying the
   cryptographic protection. This is particularly true for the LS as it
   is not the final consumer of the LO.

   When the LS protects the LO for transmission to the LR (after
   successful authorization), then the authenticated identity can be
   used to select a security association to apply proper protection of
   the location object. Securing the LO for multiple LRs is not
   provided.

   Instead of encrypting the LO, the LG could digitally sign the LO,
   offering integrity, but no confidentiality. However, if the LS needs
   to perform modifications on the LO, then it would have to break the
   digital signature and may apply its own digital signature.

   Since the LO is generally distributed to more than one LR, the LG
   lacks the necessary information about the recipient and thus cannot
   usually apply confidentially protection.

   By default, the LS re-signs LOs if the signed LO has been modified
   according to the rule set. If the LS receives an LO that it cannot
   decrypt, it discards it if and only if the rule requires modification
   of the content.

   It remains for further study whether there should be an action that
   discards an LO that is signed or encrypted and needs to be modified
   according to the matching rule set.

6. Conditions

   This section describes the location-specific conditions of a rule,
   namely the civil and geo-spatial location conditions.

6.1 Civil Location

   The <civil-loc-condition> element matches if the current location of
   the target matches all the values specified in the child elements of
   this element. The <civil-loc-condition> is of 'civilAddress' complex
   type defined in section 2.2.3 of [5]. It includes a number of fields,
   including the country (expressed as a two-letter ISO 3166 code), and
   the administrative units A1 through A6 of [10]. This designation
   offers street-level precision.

   If the civil location of the target is not known, rules that contain
   a civil location never match. (This case may occur, for example, if
   location information has been removed by earlier transmitters of
   location information or if only the geospatial location is known.)

   If any of the elements <A1> through <A6> are specified, <country>
   also MUST to be specified. The schema does not enforce that the
   specification uniquely identifies a particular location. For example,
   it would be possible to omit the region and match only on city name,
   so that any city sharing that name within a country would match. This
   'feature' is primarily designed to deal with users that may not know
   the administrative divisions between country and city level. For
   example, many users may not know the county for cities in the United
   States.

6.2 Geospatial Location

   Geospatial location conditions can be expressed by means of the
   <geospatial-loc-condition> element. Such a condition makes the rule
   match if the Target being subject of the rule is currently located
   within the trapezoid on the surface of the earth that is bounded by
   the values of longitude and latitude elements <longitude1>,
   <longitude2>, <latitude1>, and <latitude2>, regardless of the
   altitude value, if present; Figure 1 shows this. The northern
   boundary of this trapezoid is on the latitude given by the value of
   the <latitude1> element correspondingly, the southern boundary is
   given by the value of the <latitude2> element. The western boundary
   of this trapezoid is on the longitude given by the value of the
   <longitude1> element, and its eastern boundary is on the longitude
   given by the value of the <longitude2> element. These four boundaries
   can be of virtually any earthbound size. This is a means for reducing
   resolution in coordinate location.

   The Target knows where it is (shown as the inner trapezoid). This
   trapezoid might be greater in size than the dimensions of the Target
   due to precision of the measuring device issues. The rule is a match
   if the outer trapezoid falls completely outside the boundaries of the
   inner trapezoid.

7. Actions

   According to the common policy framework [8], actions and
   transformations included in a rule determine which operations the LS
   MUST execute after having received from a LR a location data access
   request that matches all conditions of this rule. Transformations
   exclusively specify LS-side operations that lead to a modification of
   the location data items requested by the LR. Actions, on the other
   hand, specify all remaining types of operations the LS is obliged to
   execute, i.e., all operations that are not of transformation type.
   This document does not define new, location-specific actions, but it
   inherits the 'confirmation' action defined in [8].

8. Transformations

   [Editors' note: This section still needs a lot of work, since there
   is a general problem concerning the formulation of permissions and
   the combining rules stated in the current version of the common
   policy document. The <latitude-resolution> transformation of data
   type Integer, for instance, does not fit to the combining rule that
   builds maxima of Integer-valued permissions. A combining rule that
   prescribes the computation of the minimum of single latitude
   resolution values would be more appropriate for this permission. This
   combining permissions issue could lead to substancial modifications
   to the combining rules section of the common policy document, and
   consequently to changes of the common policy and the geopriv policy
   markup languages and of this section.]

   In addition to the transformations below, the LS MAY translate, add
   or remove location information.  For example, they may add timezone
   information based on civil information.

   All transformations are privacy-safe, i.e., if a transformation is
   NULL (i.e., if the attribute is not present or empty in a policy
   rule), the LS removes the corresponding location information from the
   LO and leaves the LO flags undisturbed.

   Extensions to this document may define other transformations.

8.1 Set D (Distribute) Flag

   This transformation sets the D flag in the location object to either
   'true' or 'false'.  A value of 'true' means the recipient of the LO
   is allowed to further distribute it.  A value of 'false' prevents
   further distribution.

   The value NULL keeps the D flag in the LO as is. The default value is
   'false'.

8.2 Set R (Retention) Time

   The retention transformation sets the retention value in the location
   object to the current time plus the time provided in the element,
   measured in seconds.

   The value NULL keeps the retention time in the LO as is. If no
   previous value is available then the LS sets it a configured default
   value.

8.3 Keep Rule (RR)

   If the Keep Rule (RR) flag is set, any extended rules included in the
   location object are kept.

8.4 Provide Civil Location

   The Provide Civil Location transformation restricts the civil
   location to one of six levels, from lowest to highest:  null,
   country, region, city, building, full.  Each level includes all
   elements included by the lower levels.  The 'country' level includes
   only the <country> element; the 'region' level adds the <a1> element;
   the 'city' level adds the <a2> and <a3> elements; the 'building'
   level and the 'full' level add further civil location data as shown
   below.

   If this action is NULL, all civil information is removed from the LO.

   The lattice for this attribute has the following shape:

8.5 Provide Geospatial Location

   The Provide Geospatial Location transformation restricts the
   resolution of the geospatial location information to the number of

   bits provided, separately for longitude and latitude.  The default
   value is zero.

   For purposes of this transformation, longitude and latitude are
   treated as a 34 bit fixed point value consisting of 9 bits of integer
   and 25 bits of fraction.  Altitude is treated as a fixed-point 22-bit
   integer part with a 8-bit fraction, measured in meters.  This
   corresponds to the representation in [9], but does not constrain the
   representation in the location object.

   If the transformation value is NULL, all geospatial location
   information is removed from the LO.

8.6 Provide Timezone Flag

   The 'Provide Timezone' transformation indicates the inclusion or
   removal of timezone information of the target, i.e., the offset from
   UTC. The value of 'false' causes timezone information to be excluded
   from the LO.

   If the transformation value is NULL, all timezone information is
   removed from the LO.

9. Example

   The example of this section illustrates a rule set with a single
   rule. The conditions given in this rule match to a location requestor
   named ted@example.com (provided as a SIP URI in our example). The
   rule is valid for one year (2003-10-01 to 2004-10-01). Requests only
   match if the target is at his main office in a Siemens site in
   Munich. This is specified by means of the content of the
   <civil-loc-condition> element. The syntax of this content complies
   with the 'civilAddress' complex type defined in section 2.2.3 of [5].
   A confirmation action for the subscription is not necessary. The
   <transformations> section indicates that all civil location
   information is provided to the location requestor. The distribution
   flag is set to 'false' and the rules included in the LO are left
   unmodified.

   In case of a policy consisting of more than one rule and a request
   for location information that let multiple rules match, there must be
   a procedure for combining the permissions contained in the matching
   rules. This procedure is defined in [8], section 10.

10. XML Schema

   This section specifies an XML schema for the authorization policies
   described in the previous sections. The Geopriv policy markup
   language introduced by this schema extends the common policy markup
   language (see [8]) by introducing new members of the 'condition' and
   'transformation' substitution groups whose heads (namely the elements
   <condition> and <transformation>) are specified by the common policy
   schema (once again, see [8]). This way, the Geopriv policy markup
   language specializes the common rules markup language towards
   location-based presence information. To this end, the following
   schema imports the vocabulary of the common policy markup language.
   Furthermore, to express civil location information, it imports the
   'civilAddress' complex type as defined in section 2.2.3 of [5].

11. Security Considerations

   This document aims to make it simple for users to prevent the
   unintended disclosure of private information to third parties.  The
   described policies accomplish this task.  Security threats for the
   Geopriv model are described in [2] and are applicable to this draft
   as well. Requirements are addressed in [3].  Section 5 addresses
   issues of protecting the policy rules within the LO and location
   information itself.  Aspects of privacy-safe combining permissions is
   illustrated in Section 8.
