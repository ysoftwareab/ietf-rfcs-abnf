1.  Introduction

   The IS-IS routing protocol defined by [ISO10589] has been widely
   deployed in various networks.  The Geo Coordinates information can be
   useful, particularly within the wide area networks for numerous
   applications.  Similar to the Dynamic Hostname defined in [RFC5301],
   the Geo Coordinates can also be used for network management purposes.

   In the case of BGP speakers setting the outbound "MED" value in route
   advertisement to neighbors, a local policy can be defined to evaluate
   the physical location or physical region of the BGP nexthops.

   In the case of IGP point-to-multiple operations
   [I-D.lamparter-isis-p2mp], [RFC6845], the local system configuration
   can be greatly simplified if the outbound metric to remote neighbors
   can be generated automatically based on this Geo Location of the IGP
   neighbors.

   In the application where IS-IS neighbors are on the same "sub-net"
   but over the WAN network, this Geo Location information may be used
   for equal-cost or unequal-cost load sharing on the local system.
   This enables location based operation on anycast IP prefixes and DMZ
   gateways across the WAN environment.

   For the traffic matrix using the Geo Coordinates within the routing
   domain, instead of a collection of IP nexthops which might be
   translated into locations, this enables automatic region to region
   traffic pattern aggregation.

   This document describes the IS-IS protocol carrying the Geo
   Coordinates information in a new TLV.  This TLV can be distributed
   within the node's LSP or inside the IIH PDU.  The exact mechanism

   each application uses this information is outside the scope of this
   document.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Packet Encoding

   This Geo Coordinates extension introduces one TLV for IS-IS LSP PDU
   and for Hello (IIH) PDU.  The code of the TLV is described in the
   IANA Considerations section of the document.  The fields specify the
   location of the system using WGS-84 (World Geodetic System) reference
   coordinate system [WGS84].  The Geo Coordinates encoding is adapted
   from the format in [I-D.ietf-lisp-lcaf].  The value of the Geo
   Coordinates TLV consists of the following fields:

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |N|     Latitude Degrees        |    Minutes    |    Seconds    |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |E|     Longitude Degrees       |    Minutes    |    Seconds    |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                            Altitude                           |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |         .. Optional Sub-TLVs
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-....

   Type:    TBD. 8 bits value, to be assigned by IANA.

   Length:  Variable. 8 bits value.  The mandatory part is 12 octets.

   N:       When set to 1 means North, otherwise South.

   Latitude Degrees:  Valid values range from 0 to 90 degrees above or
            below the equator (northern or southern hemisphere,
            respectively).

   Latitude Minutes:  Valid values range from 0 to 59.

   Latitude Seconds:  Valid values range from 0 to 59.

   E:       When set to 1 means East, otherwise West.

   Longitude Degrees:  Value values are from 0 to 180 degrees right or
            left of the Prime Meridian.

   Longitude Minutes:  Valid values range from 0 to 59.

   Longitude Seconds:  Valid values range from 0 to 59.

   Altitude:  Height relative to sea level in meters.  This is a signed
            integer meaning that the altitude could be below sea level.
            A value of 0x7fffffff indicates no Altitude value is
            encoded.

   Optional Sub-TLV:  Not defined in this document, for future extension
            related to the Geo Coordinates information.

3.  Operations

   This IS-IS Geo Coordinates TLV can be optionally included in the
   node's LSP of fragment number zero.  This TLV can also be optionally
   included in the IIH PDU.  This can be useful when the application is
   setting the outbound p2mp circuit metric based on the neighbor's
   location.  This can also be used in the Spine-Leaf extension
   [I-D.shen-isis-spine-leaf-ext] where there is no LSP being flooded
   into the leaf nodes.

   The Geo location information can be statically provisioned on the
   system, or it can be dynamically acquired from the GPS capable device
   on the system.

4.  IANA Considerations

   A new TLV codepoint is defined in this document and needs to be
   assigned by IANA from the "IS-IS TLV Codepoints" registry.  It is
   referred to as the Geo Coordinates TLV.  This TLV is only to be
   optionally inserted in the LSP PDU and the IIH PDU.  This document
   does not propose any sub-TLV out of this Geo Coordinates TLV.

      Value  Name                   IIH  LSP  SNP  Purge
      -----  ---------------------  ---  ---  ---  -----
      TBD    Geo Coordinates         y    y    n    n

5.  Security Considerations

   Security concerns for IS-IS are addressed in [ISO10589], [RFC5304],
   [RFC5310], and [RFC7602].  This extension does not raise additional
   security issues.
