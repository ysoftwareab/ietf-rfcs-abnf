1.  Introduction

   Router advertisement and router solicitation messages defined in
   [RFC4861] are used during stateless IPv6 autoconfiguration.  A mobile
   node listens for router advertisement messages that are periodically
   sent by access routers on the local link or are explicitly requested
   by the mobile node using a router solicitation message.  The router
   advertisement message contains information to allow the mobile node
   configures a global unicast IPv6 address.  The provided information
   by the router advertisement message is, for instance, network
   prefix(es), default router address(es), hop limit, etc.

   The router advertisement message is used by an access router to
   provide the network prefix information required for stateless IPv6
   autoconfiguration, whereas the router solicitation message is used by
   a mobile node to quickly receive the router advertisement message
   from the access router.  In other words, the current specification of
   Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 does not specifies how the access
   router obtains the deprecated network prefix information (e.g.,
   previous network prefix information) from the mobile node keeping
   deprecated IPv6 address(es) that are for instance global unicast IPv6
   address(es) generated and used at previous access networks.

   This document introduces new extensions to router advertisement and
   router solicitation messages to allow a mobile node provides its
   deprecated network prefix information to an access router.

2.  Motivation

   A mobile node changes its point of attachment from a previous network
   to a new network while keeping its global unicast IPv6 address for
   communications with a correspondent node.  The mobile node configures
   a new global unicast IPv6 address at the new network and uses the new
   address for new communications.  The mobile node also may use the

   deprecated address (i.e., the previously configured address at the
   previous network) for the communications with the correspondent node.

   Nowadays ingress filtering is widely used to prevent source address
   spoofing.  In this case, when the mobile node sends packets with the
   deprecated address as a source address, the packets will be filtered
   unless a rule of ingress filtering is updated in advance.

   An access router at the new network may need to obtain the mobile
   node's deprecated network prefix information.  For instance, the new
   access router needs to establish a bidirectional tunnel with the
   previous access router of the mobile node for the communications
   associated with the deprecated address of the mobie node
   [Paper-Distributed.Mobility].

3.  Option Formats

   A router solicitation message is extended to include the deprecated
   network prefix information.  A router advertisement message is
   extended to include a flag that requests the mobile node to send a
   router solicitation message including the deprecated network prefix
   information.

3.1.  Network Prefix Provision in Router Solicitations

   A new flag is defined to indicate that a router solicitation message
   includes the deprecated network prefix information of a mobile node
   in the prefix information option.

    4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |L|A|D|Reserved1|
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   D: 1-bit "Deprecated network prefix" flag.  It indicates that the
   prefix included in this prefix information option is the deprecated
   network prefix of the mobile node.

   When the mobile node wants to send the deprecated prefix to the new
   access router, the prefix information option is used to carry the
   deprecated network prefix and the D flag is set to 1.

3.2.  Network Prefix Provision in Router Advertisements

   A new flag is defined to request the deprecated network prefix
   information in a sourter solicitation message.

   D: 1-bit "Deprecated network prefix" flag.  It indicates that the
   deprecated network prefix of the mobile node is needed by an access
   router.

   When a mobile node receives the router advertisement message
   containing the D flag set to 1, the mobile node should respond with a
   router solicitation message carring the prefix information option and
   with D flag set to 1 in the option.  In the prefix information
   option, the deprecated network prefix of the mobile node is
   contained.

   After the new access router learns the previous prefix of the
   specific mobile node, it updates the rule of ingress filter.
   Afterwards, the D flag in the following Routrer Advertisement message
   sent to this mobile node will be set to 0 and the mobile node will
   recognize that its previous prefix has been recorded by the access
   router.  Then the mobile node will not feedback with Router
   Soliciation message.

   This extension is not supported by the access router if the D flag is
   not influded in the Router Advertisement message and then the mobile
   node should not send Router Solicitation message accordingly.
