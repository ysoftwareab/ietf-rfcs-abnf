Abstract

   This document describes procedures for IP multicast over a MPLS
   Traffic Engineered (TE) core. The defined procedures apply when the
   Provider Edge (PE) routers are running PIM-SM to exchange multicast
   routing information with the Customer Edge (CE) routers. Point to
   multipoint (P2MP) MPLS TE LSPs are used in the network core. The
   procedures described make use of the PIM-SM remote neighbor
   extensions described in [PIM-SM-REMOTE].

1. Introduction

   This document describes procedures for IP multicast over a MPLS TE
   core. It addresses the case where MPLS TE is used in the network core
   and the edge PE routers are participating in multicast routing with
   CE routers or routers in other network domains. The following figure
   shows a sample topology:


              Multicast Source 1 (S1) (G1, G2, G3)
                     |
                    Spe1
                   |   |
                   |   |
     R2----Rpe2--P1   P2---Rpe1--(R1) (G1)
     (G2, G3)     |
                 Rpe3----R3 (G2, G3)
                  |
                  |
                  R4 (G1)

                Figure 1.


   A source-PE (Spe) is the PE that is receiving traffic from the
   multicast traffic source. The multicast traffic source may be one or
   more hops away. A receiver-PE (Rpe) is the PE that is delivering
   multicast traffic to one or more receivers. The receivers may be one
   or more than one hop away.

   In Figure 1 Spe1 is the source-PE. Rpe1, Rpe2 and Rpe3 are receiver-
   PEs. Spe1, Rpe1, Rpe2 and Rpe3 are the edge routers and are
   participating in multicast routing with S1, R1, R2, R3 and R4. S1 is
   the multicast source that is sending traffic for groups G1, G2 and
   G3. R1, R2, R3 and R4 are multicast receivers.  R1 is listening to
   G1, R2 to G2 and G3, R3 to G2 and G3 and R4 to G1.  P1 and P2 are the
   core routers and are participating in MPLS TE along with the edge
   routers.

   In such a scenario it may not be desirable to run PIM-SM in the
   network core i.e on P1 and P2 in Figure 1. This may be because:



draft-raggarwa-pim-sm-remote-nbr-00.txt                         [Page 2]

Internet Draft    draft-raggarwa-pim-sm-mpls-te-00.txt    September 2003


      a) It is desired to keep core routers free of multicast routing
   state.
      b) It is desired to have a BGP free core. BGP is needed in the
   core to distribute unicast routes for multicast RPF used by PIM-SM.
   This is no longer the case if PIM-SM is not used in the network core.
   Thus if the core is BGP free for unicast routing (e.g. RSVP-TE is
   used in the core), not running PIM-SM in the core ensures that a
   provider can truly have a BGP free core.
      c) The multicast application that the PE routers are participating
   in makes it necessary to use TE in the core for multicast traffic
   [P2MP-MPLS-TE-REQ].
      d) PIM-SM control traffic may originate from outside the provider
   domain.  In this case it may be desirable to keep the PIM-SM control
   traffic out of the network core.

   The procedures described in this document enable a provider to offer
   IP multicast services and at the same time have a multicast routing
   (i.e. PIM-SM) free core. The mechanism described depends on the
   presence of P2MP MPLS TE LSPs [P2MP-MPLS-TE-REQ, P2MP-RSVP-TE] in the
   network core. The rest of this document uses the term P2MP LSP to
   refer to a P2MP MPLS TE LSP.  Thus in Figure 1 there may be a P2MP
   LSP from Spe1 with Rpe1, Rpe2, Rpe3 as the endpoints. P2MP MPLS TE
   technology is being developed in the MPLS WG.  [P2MP-RSVP-TE]
   describes one mechanism for setting up P2MP LSPs. However the
   procedures described in this document are independent of the
   mechanism used for setting up the P2MP LSP.

   This document describes:
      a) Exchange of multicast routing information between the edge
   routers
      b) Discovery of the P2MP LSP endpoints by a Spe. Thus with respect
   to Figure 1, discovery of Rpe1, Rpe2 and Rpe3 as endpoints of a
   particular P2MP LSP, by Spe1.
      c) Association of the multicast routing state with a P2MP LSP.
   This pertains to associating multicast routing state that Spe1 learns
   from Rpe1, Rpe2 and Rpe3 with the relevant P2MP LSP.
      d) The forwarding state at the Spe and the Rpe to enable IP
   multicast over a P2MP LSP.

2. PIM-SM Control State Exchange Between Edge Routers

   As mentioned in the previous section, the network core is PIM-SM
   free. However the edge PE routers are running PIM-SM towards the CEs
   or other network domains. Thus they need to exchange PIM-SM routing
   information.  This is accomplished by using PIM-SM remote neighbors
   as described in [PIM-SM-REMOTE].  The reception of a PIM-SM
   Join/Prune for a particular multicast source address (S) at a Rpe, is
   followed by resolving S onto the BGP next-hop that is advertising S.
   The BGP next-hop for reaching S is the Spe. The resolution of a PIM-
   SM Join/Prune onto a Spe results in the Rpe initiating a remote
   neighbor adjacency with the Spe. This is followed by the Rpe sending
   the PIM-SM Join/Prune to the Spe.

   For instance in Figure 1, if Rpe1 receives a PIM-SM Join/Prune
   message from R1, for S1 as the source, it has to propagate the Join
   to Spe1. Rpe1 learns the route to reach S1 from Spe1. Hence when it
   receives a PIM-SM Join for S1, it determines Spe1 as the next-hop for
   reaching S1. Rpe1 then establishes a remote neighbor adjacency with
   Spe1. It then sends the Join/Prune message to Spe1.

   It is to be noted that the Rpes may be running IGMP towards the
   receivers.  In that case if the IGMP joins are source specific, the
   Rpe can send PIM-SM Joins as described above to the Spe. Else PIM-SM
   Joins have to be sent to the RP.


3. P2MP LSP Endpoint Discovery

   As described above [PIM-SM-REMOTE] procedures are used to propagate
   PIM-SM Join/Prune messages from a Rpe to the Spe. The receipt of a
   PIM-SM Join message from a Rpe allows the Spe to treat the Rpe as a
   P2MP LSP leaf. There may be various ways to associate the Join
   message with a particular P2MP LSP.  This is discussed further in the
   next section. Once the Join message is associated with a P2MP LSP,
   Spe initiates the setup of the P2MP LSP with the Rpe as the endpoint,
   if the P2MP LSP doesn't already exist. If the P2MP LSP exists, but
   the Rpe is not one of the existing leaves, Spe adds the Rpe as a new
   leaf to the existing P2MP LSP. If the P2MP LSP exists and the Rpe is
   one of the existing leaves, Spe leaves the existing P2MP LSP
   unchanged.

   Let us consider an example with respect to Figure 1.

      a) R4 sends a PIM-SM Join for (S1, G1) to Rpe3.
      b) Rpe3 determines Spe1 as the next-hop for reaching S1. It
   establishes a remote neighbor adjacency with Spe1 and sends the
   directed Join to Spe1.

Internet Draft    draft-raggarwa-pim-sm-mpls-te-00.txt    September 2003


      c) Spe1 decides to map (S1, G1) received from Rpe3 to P2MP-LSP1.
   As described in the next section, the exact procedures for this
   mapping are a matter local to Spe1. Initially, P2MP-LSP1 doesn't
   exist, so Spe1 initiates the setup of P2MP-LSP1 with Rpe3 as a
   destination.
      d) R1 sends a Join for (S1, G1) to Rpe1.
      e) Rpe1 follows [PIM-SM-REMOTE] procedures and sends the directed
   Join to Spe1.
      f) Spe1 maps (S1, G1) received from Rpe1 to P2MP-LSP1
      g) Spe1 adds a new branch to P2MP-LSP1 with Rpe1 as a destination.

   If the Spe receives a Prune from a Rpe, it first associates the Prune
   with a P2MP LSP. If the Spe has no other Join state that would keep
   Rpe on the P2MP LSP, it can remove Rpe from the LSP.  If this was the
   last Rpe interested in the P2MP LSP, this will result in tear down of
   the P2MP LSP.


4. Mapping IP Multicast Traffic to a P2MP LSP

   The Spe on receiving a Join message for a particular (S, G) or (*, G)
   associates this Join message with a particular P2MP LSP. This in turn
   results in creating a multicast forwarding entry for that source and
   group with the P2MP LSP as an outgoing interface. As a result the IP
   multicast traffic for that source and group can be sent to the P2MP
   LSP. The selection of the P2MP LSP for a particular source and group
   is a decision that is local to the Spe. A few potential schemes for
   selecting a P2MP LSP are outlined here:

     a) The Spe may create only one P2MP LSP for all possible Rpes. In
   this case each new Rpe is added as a leaf to that P2MP LSP. Clearly
   this has the disadvantage of sending all the multicast traffic to all
   the Rpes that are part of the P2MP LSP. Thus in Figure 1, Spe1 may
   decide to map (S1, G1), (S1, G2) and (S1, G3) from all the Rpes to
   the same P2MP-LSP. As a result Rpe1 will receive traffic for (S1, G2)
   (S1, G3) and Rpe2 for (S1, G1), even though they do not have any
   receivers interested in the same.

     b)  On the other extreme the Spe may be configured to create a
   separate P2MP LSP for every multicast source and group. Hence a (S,
   G) entry is mapped to the P2MP LSP corresponding to the multicast
   source S and group, G. The number of P2MP LSPs in this case is equal
   to the number of multicast source, group combinations. This has
   scaling limitations. Thus in Figure 1, Spe1 may setup three P2MP
   LSPs. One each for (S1, G1), (S1, G2) and (S1, G3).

     c) The Spe may associate a set of (S, G) entries Ssg = {(S1, G1),
   (S2, G2)...  (Sn, Gn)} with the same P2MP LSP. The exact procedures



draft-raggarwa-pim-sm-remote-nbr-00.txt                         [Page 5]

Internet Draft    draft-raggarwa-pim-sm-mpls-te-00.txt    September 2003


   for doing this are outside the scope of this document. One example is
   when all the Rpes that are part of the P2MP LSP have sent Join
   messages for all the members of Ssg.  Spe1, in Figure 1, may map (S1,
   G1) to P2MP-LSP1 and {(S1, G2), (S1, G3)} to P2MP-LSP2. P2MP-LSP1
   includes destinations Rpe1 and Rpe3. P2MP-LSP1 includes destinations
   Rpe2 and Rpe3.


5. RPF Interface on a Rpe

   A Rpe has to associate a particular P2MP LSP as the RPF interface for
   a given (S, G) entry that the Rpe has propagated to a Spe. This P2MP
   LSP must be the same as the P2MP LSP that is used by the Spe for
   sending IP multicast traffic for that paricular (S, G) entry. As
   described above the selection of a P2MP LSP for a (S, G) entry is Spe
   driven. This implies that a Spe has to propagate the association
   between a P2MP LSP and all the (S, G) entrires being mapped onto that
   LSP, to all the Rpes that are part of that P2MP LSP.

   This document introduces a new PIM-SM message, Join Acknowledge, for
   this purpose. It also introduces the notion of "PIM-SM Route
   Attributes" that can be used to associate common properties
   associated with the Group Sets in a Join Acknowledge message. Thus a
   Join Ack can be sent by the Spe to a particular Rpe and convey the
   P2MP LSP identifier associated with the (S, G) entries, by encoding
   it as a Route Attribute.

   Once the Rpe receives the P2MP LSP association for a particular (S,
   G) entry, it uses that P2MP LSP as the RPF interface for the (S, G)
   entry. It is to be noted that the P2MP LSP interface will be inferred
   based on the incoming MPLS label. Hence penultimate hop popping has
   to be disabled for a P2MP LSP carrying IP multicast traffic.

5.1. Route Attribute

   This document introduces the notion of a PIM-SM Route Attribute List.
   This is a list of Route Attributes that can encoded in a PIM-SM
   message.  The intention is to associate the Group Sets in the message
   with a set of Route Attributes. For solving the RPF problem which is
   explained above, one of these Attributes can be used for mapping the
   Group Sets carried in the Join Acknowledge message to a particular
   P2MP LSP. It is envisioned that these Route Attributes can also be
   more generally applicable.

   A Route Attribute List contains a list of Route Attributes:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   Currently only one Route Attribute TLV is defined: "P2MP LSP
   Attribute", with Type = 1. The length and value are set based on the
   P2MP LSP Identifier as defined in [P2MP-RSVP-TE].

5.2. Join Acknowledge

   This is a new PIM-SM message with Type=9. It is sent by the
   destination of the Join message to the source of the Join message. It
   carries attributes associated with the Group Sets that the
   destination of the Join message wishes to convey to the source of the
   Join message. Following is the format of the Join Acknowledge
   message:

   Hence to solve the RPF interface issue, the Spe sends a Join
   Acknowledge to a particular Rpe. The Join Acknowledge carries the
   P2MP LSP Attribute. This enables the Rpe to receive the P2MP
   association for the Group Sets.


6. Security Considerations

   Security considerations discussed in [PIM-SM] and [PIM-SM-REMOTE]
   apply.  Other security considerations are for further study.
