1. Comments and Suggestions

   This chapter consists of a central repository for all the comments
   and suggestions that have been received with regard to the XMLDSIG
   main specification.



   #98072901 - Syntax too verbose

      Origin:   General
      Status:   Superceded by 98091001, 98091002

      Comments:

         "The syntax is far too much verbose."

      Author Notes:

         There are multiple optimizations that could be envisioned:

         -   Promote syntax compactness instead of element reusability.
         -   Adopt syntax that enables shared algorithm definitions.
         -   Adopt default attribute and parameter values.



   #98091001 - Enable shared algorithm definitions

      Origin:   Richard D. Brown
      Status:   Opened

      Comments:

         "Considering that in most circumstances the digest of
         authenticate resources will be computed by means of a common
         digest algorithm, it seems preferable to define a syntax that
         allows shared algorithm definitions.

         Several approaches might be considered. The first one consists
         of adding a DigestAlgorithms element in every signature
         Manifest and using some linking mechanism (i.e. IDREF) to bind
         a digest value with a digest algorithm. Another approach is to
         allow definitions throughout the document and requiring the
         canonicalizer to inline the algorithm definition in the Digest
         elements."






Richard D. Brown                                                [Page 4]



INTERNET-DRAFT          July 1998  Digital Signatures for XML - Comments



      Author Notes:

         The first approach does not prevent replication of algorithm
         definitions in the header of the document and the different
         signature Manifests. On the other hand, the second approach
         requires particular behaviors in the canonicalizers and
         therefore cannot suffice with a surface string digest
         algorithm.



   #98091002 - Promote compactness over reusability

      Origin:   Richard D. Brown
      Status:   Opened

      Comments:

         "The current specification makes use of reusable element types.
         This approach obviously increases the "verbosity" of the
         syntax. It might be preferable to promote compactness instead
         of reusability."

         For example, the following optimizations might be considered:

            -  Collapsing Locator into Resource.
            -  Collapsing ContentInfo into Package.
            -  Replacing basic data types (i.e. Integer, Date, etc...) by
               a DCD attribute and a PCDATA contents on the parent
               element.

      Author Notes:



   #98111301 - Add a Resource criticality attribute

      Origin:   Milton M. Anderson
      Status:   Opened

      Comments:

         "The definition of <resource> does not contain a feature to
         allow the signer to declare that the resource is critical to
         the validity of the signature."







Richard D. Brown                                                [Page 5]



INTERNET-DRAFT          July 1998  Digital Signatures for XML - Comments



      Author Notes:

         I do not have all the elements for judging how relevant is this
         particular comment, but my first guess is that a signature
         applies to a particular content and semantics verification
         shall be left to the application layer.



   #98111302 - Remove dsig:eval global attribute

      Origin:   Milton M. Anderson
      Status:   Closed

      Comments:

         "Having the dsig:eval attribute in the element that defines the
         authenticated block is probably a bad idea, since different
         signers can use different hash algorithm."

      Author Notes:

         Others have made a similar comment, but we have reached a
         different conclusion: dsig:eval shall be an IDREFS instead of
         an IDREF.



   #98111303 - Add a logging attribute

      Origin:   Milton M. Anderson
      Status:   Closed

      Comments:

         "No ability to mark data for logging by a signing hardware is
         included."

      Author Notes:

         Also, very much application specific. I am not quite sure this
         shall be a concern for the XML DSIG Proposal.










Richard D. Brown                                                [Page 6]



INTERNET-DRAFT          July 1998  Digital Signatures for XML - Comments



   #98111304 - Add a signature purpose attribute

      Origin:   Milton M. Anderson
      Status:   Closed

      Comments:

         "The signature doesn't have a "type of signature" element."

      Author Notes:

         This may be provided at the application level by means of a
         complementary attribute.



   #98111305 - Add a Nonce in the Manifest

      Origin:   Milton M. Anderson
      Status:   Closed

      Comments:

         "No nonce to be used in hashing the resource is defined."

      Author Notes:

         Milton refers to a scheme that could be used for preventing
         birthday-attacks against the digest algorithm.

         E-Check makes use of this artifice to make sure that a
         fraudulent signer or a Trojan Horse on the signer's computer
         does not have full control over the data being signed by the
         signing device. If the attacker were able to find two messages
         M1 and M2 such that H(M1) = H(M2), it could send M1 to the
         device and then substitute M2 later. The hardware log will
         record that M1 has been signed and not M2.

         This problem may be addressed in the hardware log by itself.
         The device may sign H(M1), pick a nonce at random, and log the
         nonce value along with H(nonce||M1) for example.

   #98112501 - Leverage DCD and other specifications

      Origin:   Hiroshi Maruyama
      Status:   Opened

      Comments:

         "For data types, I think we could refer to other activities
         such as DCD."

      Author Notes:

         Agreed as long as these specifications are adopted in time.
         Notice that DCD provides mostly for basic data types. This will
         not resolve the problem for the constructed data types such as
         IssuerAndSerialNumber, Package, etc...



   #98121501 - IssuerAndSerialNumber is too restrictive

      Origin:   Richard D. Brown
      Status:   Opened

      Comments:

         "Identifying a certificate by means of the constructed data
         types IssuerAndSerialNumber might be too restrictive. It is not
         obvious that this construct is sufficient for certificates
         other than X509v3. The specification shall adopt syntax a bit
         more opened.

         For example, a certificate might be uniquely identified by
         means of a Identifier element, whose syntax depends upon the
         type of the certificate."

   #98122601 - Allow multiple Resource in Manifest

      Origin:   Don Eastlake
      Status:   Adopted (990404)

      Comments:

         "I believe that multiple occurrences of Resource should be
         permitted in the Manifest"

      Author Notes:

         The Manifest now requires a Resources element.



   #98122602 - Add a base locator for HREFs

      Origin:   Don Eastlake - IOTP WG
      Status:   Opened

      Comments:

         "Some of the IOTP concerns about many huge locator HREFs could
         be satisfied if a "base" attribute were permitted at the
         Resources level or, even more general, a Base element, which
         effected all following resource."

      Author Notes:



   #98122603 - Rename the attribute dsig:eval

      Origin:   Don Eastlake
      Status:   Opened

      Comments:

         "I do not like the choice of "eval" even if it is arbitrary. It
         makes me think of Lisp or the like. I would expect it to
         evaluate arithmetic expressions or the like. I think the
         previous "hash" was better and perhaps "dsig:digest" would be
         best..."

      Origin:   Don Eastlake
      Status:   Opened

      Comments:

         "What's about defaulting to base64 instead of none for the

   #99010201 - Add a ID attribute to Algorithm

      Origin:   Mark Linehan
      Status:   Superceded (98091001)

      Comments:

         "I suggest adding an "id" attribute to the Algorithm element,
         and adding an algref attribute to any element that contains an
         Algorithm. Purpose is to avoid repeating the same Algorithm
         text in many places."

      Author Notes:

         One approach to address #98091001



   #99010202 - Provide a default digest algorithm

      Origin:   Mark Linehan
      Status:   Closed

      Comments:

         "I suggest that it would be helpful to have a way to declare a
         default or standard digest algorithm. Reason: in most cases,
         the same algorithm will be used throughout a document."

      Author Notes:

         Adequate optimization should enable use of shared definitions.
         In such circumstances, the overhead on a Resource element will
         be limited to an IDREF. At first, removing all algorithm
         references from the Resource element does not seem a good idea

   #99010203 - Add a type to RecipientInfo and OriginatorInfo

      Origin:   Mark Linehan
      Status:   Closed

      Comments:

         "I suggest that OriginatorInfo and RecipientInfo have a "type"
         attribute for the same reason as the Attribute element: to
         identify the format of the ANY content."

      Author Notes:

         RecipientInfo and OriginatorInfo are expected to be a
         collection of "attributes". Therefore, it does not make sense
         to define a "type" attribute for these elements.



   #99020301 - Adopt URL instead of URI

      Origin:   Joseph Reagle
      Status:   Opened

      Comments:

         "What's about adopting URLs instead of URNs. This will prevent
         registration requirements. At the least, the specification
         should allow URIs."

      Author Notes:



   #99021201 - Allow multiple signatures on a Manifest

      Origin:   IOTP WG
      Status:   Opened

      Comments:

         "Ability to have multiple signatures on a single Manifest and
         ability to adhere a recipient to a Signature."

INTERNET-DRAFT          July 1998  Digital Signatures for XML - Comments



         To address these concerns, IOTP DTD proposes the following
         construct:

           <!-- DTD Extract -->

           <!ELEMENT Signature (Manifest, Value+)>
           <!ELEMENT Manifest ((Manifest,
             Resources, Attributes?, OriginatorInfo, RecipientInfo+
           )>
           <!ELEMENT RecipientInfo ANY>
           <!ATTLIST RecipientInfo
             SignatureValueRef    IDREF    #REQUIRED
             SignatureCertRef     IDREF    #IMPLIED
           >

           <!-- Signature Example -->

           <Signature>
             <Manifest>
               <Resources>
                 ...
               </Resources>
               <OriginatorInfo>
                 ...
               </OriginatorInfo>
               <RecipientInfo
                 SignatureValueRef='sigv1'
                 SignatureCertRef='cert1'>

           <Certificates>
             <Certificate id='cert1' ...>

             </Certificate>
             <Certificate id='cert2' ...>
               ...
             </Certificate>
           </Certificate>

      Author Notes:

         Assuming that the benefit expected from this construct is to
         prevent replication of a large Manifest in multiple Signature
         elements, I would remind that this specification allows for
         shared Resources element

         I can see at least three potential drawbacks with this
         construct:

            -  Privacy: A signature value cannot be verified unless all
               the RecipientInfo elements are preserved into the
               Manifest. In some circumstances, it may not be desirable
               to disclose the identity of the other recipients. Notice
               however that this construct does not preclude the
               creation of independent signature elements.

            -  Complexity: This construct is obviously more
               complicated than the one currently proposed. Dual forward
               references are not always easy to handle.

            -  Inconsistency: Applying multiple signatures to a single
               document usually implies that the application has adopted
               some secret-key authentication scheme. In such
               circumstances, the originator may be known by the
               recipients under different names or accounts. But, this
               construct does not allow replication of the
               OriginatorInfo element (per recipient basis), which is
               supposed to carry such pieces of information.



   #99021202 - Enable shared digest algorithm definitions

      Origin:   IOTP WG
      Status:   Superceded by 98091002

      Comments:

         "Ability to share digest algorithms for signatures, digest, and
         canonicalization"


Richard D. Brown                                               [Page 13]



INTERNET-DRAFT          July 1998  Digital Signatures for XML - Comments



         To address this concern, the IOTP DTD proposes to insert a
         collection of algorithm definitions into the signature Manifest
         and to use a linking mechanism for binding Resource definitions
         and signature algorithms to these shared definitions.

           <!-- DTD Extract -->

           <!ELEMENT Manifest (
                     Algorithm+,
                     Resource+,
                     Attributes?,
                     OriginatorInfo,
                     RecipientInfo+
           )>

           <!ELEMENT Digest (#PCDATA)>
           <!ATTLIST Digest
                     DigestAlgorithmRef    IDREF    #REQUIRED
           >

      Author Notes:

         Potential solution to optimizing the syntax. However, I would
         suggest replacing the collection of Algorithm elements by a
         DigestAlgorithms element. Also, I would limit this
         functionality to the Digest elements.

         with a debate over 'criticality' ... PKIX and S/MIME show signs
         of precisely this kind of bloat."

      Author Notes:

         Tend to agree that criticality shall be a matter of the relying
         party and, therefore, a criticality attribute provided by the
         signer is not necessary in the syntax.

   #99040101 - Remove Attributes element

      Origin:   Yoshiaki Kawatsura

      Comments:

         "I do not understand why the Attributes element is needed."

      Author Notes:

         Collection elements such Attributes, Certificates, and
         Signatures has been proposed to facilitate DOM manipulation.
         For example, one may call some trust verification engine by
         passing the Certificates sub-tree. This construct enables
         containment of similar and related elements.

      Comments:

         "It seems that allowing per Resource attributes may have
         interesting applications. For example, a rating standard could
         define a rating:Public attribute that could be associated
         directly with the Resource element. In such circumstances, a
         rating standard could almost suffice with the current DTD
         definitions."

      Status:   Opened

      Comments:

         "All signature schemes require canonicalization and digest of
         the Manifest. Thence, all the signature algorithms require at
         least a digest-algorithm parameter and this has lead to some
         inconsistencies such as requiring a digest algorithm for rsa
         encryption or two hash functions for HMAC.

         It may be preferable to add a CanonicalAlgorithm element in the
         signature Manifest. This element will identify the
         digest/canonical algorithm to be used for computation of the
         fingerprint of the Signature Manifest."

         An alternative a bit more opened would consist of defining
         Attributes as an element of ANY contents and use constructed
         attribute element."

           <Resource href='http://www.w3c.org/doc.xml'>
             <Attributes>
               <rating:Audience value='all'/>
             </Attributes>
             ...
           </Resource>

      Author Notes:

         One could argue that origin, digest, and the forth are also
         attributes of the resource and, therefore, could be sealed in
         the Attributes element. In fact, we could remove the Attributes
         element and define Resource as an element of ANY contents. But,
         if we were to do so, it would be impossible to enforce the
         presence of mandatory attribute elements such as resource
         locator and digest by means of the DTD.

         If this suggestion were to be adopted, we may consider
         converting the ContentInfo element into a standard attribute.

      Comments:

         "The specification proposes a ContentInfo element with a type
         and subtype attribute. The type attribute is defined as an URN.
         Unfortunately, URN specification does not allow the character
         "/" in the NSS. Thence, it is not possible to map directly
         existing MIME types into an URN without adopting adequate NSS
         encoding. For example, "application/msword" shall be encoded
         into something like "urn:MIME:application%2fmsword."

         An alternative could be to define the ContentInfo element as
         follows:

           <!ELEMENT ContentInfo (#PCDATA)>
           <!ATTLIST ContentInfo
                     type    CDATA    #IMPLIED 'urn:MIME'
           >

           <!-- Examples -->

           <ContentInfo>
             application/msword
           </ContentInfo>

   #99040701 - Allow Resource by value in Manifest

      Origin:   John Boyer, Richard D. Brown
      Status:   Opened

      Comments:

         "It may be worth considering the possibility to define a
         Resource either by means of a locator and a digest or by
         value."

         We may consider the following definition:

           <!ELEMENT Resource ((Locator, Digest) | Value)>

      Author Notes:

         Adopting this approach will disallow collapsing the Locator
         element into the Resource element. If the value is provided it
         does not make a lot of sense to specify a resource location.
         But, Xlink specification seems to require the href attribute
         (not clear in the specification).

         "It may be worth considering segregation of the data types that

         some DCD attribute, and others such as IssuerAndSerialNumber or
         Package might be temporarily moved into some Data DTD. These
         element definitions will be later superceded by definitions

   #99061601 - Replace dsig:eval by a PI

      Origin:   Richard D. Brown
      Status:   Opened

      Comments:

         As mentioned earlier by Milton M. Anderson (98111302), having
         the dsig:eval attribute directly in the element being
         authenticated may be unpractical if different signers were to
         use different hash algorithms.

         A different approach consists of the definition of a Processing
         Instruction that specifies the algorithm to be used. This
         processing instruction could be inserted just before the
         element to be hashed and is not part of the hash value. Change
         in the value of the processing instruction does not invalidate
         previous signatures. Moreover, because the digest algorithm
         definitions are replicated into the Manifest, an attacker
         cannot attack the authentication scheme by tampering with the
         processing instruction.

         "XML-Signature should use the RDF data model but need not use

         Signature syntax should consist of a static representation of a
         RDF schema. In the short term this static representation will
         translate into a DTD that will be replaced by the actual RDF
         schema as RDF awareness will develop in the Industry.
