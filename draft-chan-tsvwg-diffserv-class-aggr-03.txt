Abstract

   In the core of a high capacity network, service differentiation is
   still needed to support applications' utilization of the network.
   Applications with similar traffic characteristics and performance
   requirements are mapped into different diffserv service classes based
   on end-to-end behavior requirements of the applications.  However,
   some network segments may be configured in such a way that a single

   forwarding treatment satisfy the traffic characteristics and
   performance requirements of two or more service classes.  For such
   cases, it may be desirable to aggregate two or more service classes
   into a forwarding treatment.  This document provides guidelines for
   aggregation of service classes into forwarding treatments.

1.  Introduction

   In the core of a high capacity network, it is common for the network
   to be engineered in such a way that a major link, switch, or router
   can fail and the result be a routed network that still meets ambient
   SLAs.  The implication of this is that there is sufficient capacity
   on any given link that all SLAs sold can be simultaneously supported
   at their respective maximum rates, and this remains true after re-
   routing (either IP re-routing or MPLS protection-mode switching) has
   occurred.

   It is frequently argued that such over provisioning meets the
   requirements of all traffic without further QoS treatment, and from a
   certain perspective that is true.  However, as the process of network
   convergence continues, certain services still have issues.  While
   delay and jitter is perfectly acceptable for elastic applications,
   real time applications are negatively affected, and in extreme cases
   (such as some reported around the September 2001 attacks on the US
   East Coast, or under extreme DOS load) such surges could disrupt
   routing.

   The treatment aggregates recommended herein are designed to aggregate
   the service classes in Diffserv Service Classes [5] in such a manner
   as to protect real-time traffic and routing, on the assumption that
   real-time sessions are protected from each other by admission at the
   edge, and provide a staged response to stress.

   The document Diffserv Service Classes [5] provides the basic diffserv
   classes from the points of view of the application requiring specific
   end-to-end behaviors from the network.  At some network segments of
   the end-to-end path, the number of levels of network treatment
   differentiation may be less than the number of service classes that
   the network segment needs to support.  In such situation, that
   network segment needs to use the same treatment to support more than
   one service class.  In this document we provide guidelines of how
   multiple service classes may be aggregated into a forwarding
   treatment aggregate.  Notice in a given domain, we recommend the
   supported service classes be aggregated into forwarding treatment
   aggregates, this does not mean all service classes needs to be
   supported and hence not all forwarding treatment aggregates needs to
   be supported.  Which service classes and which forwarding treatement
   aggregates is supported by a domain is up to the domain
   administration and may be influenced by business reasons.  We've also
   provided some terminology and requirement for performing this
   aggregation.

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].


2.  Terminology

   We try to use existing definition of terms from current RFCs.  We
   have also added new definition of terms here when necessary.

   o  Treatment Aggregate.  This term is used here to indicate the
      aggregate of DiffServ service classes.  This is different from
      Behavior Aggregate and Traffic Aggregate because Treatment
      Aggregate is only concerned with the treatment of the aggregated
      traffic.  It does not concern with how the aggregated traffic is
      marked, and hence does not put a restriction on the aggregated
      traffic having a single codepoint that have a single PHB.


3.  Overview of Service Class Aggregation

   In some deployments, especially in the middle of the network where
   network capacity is higher, traffic treatment differentiation may be
   less granular.  In these deployments, aggregation of the different
   service classes may be more practical.

   These aggregations have the following requirements:

   1.  The end-to-end network performance characteristic required by the
       application MUST be supported.  This performance characteristic
       is represented by the use of Diffserv Service Classes [5].

   2.  The treatment aggregate MUST exhibit the strictest requirement of
       its member service classes.

   3.  The treatment aggregate SHOULD only contain member service
       classes with similar traffic characteristic and performance
       requirements.

   4.  The notion of the individual end-to-end service classes MUST NOT
       be destroyed when aggregation is performed.  Each domain along
       the end-to-end path may perform aggregation differently, based on
       the original end-to-end service classes.  We RECOMMEND an easy
       way to accomplish this by NOT altering the DSCP used to indicate
       the end-to-end service class.  But some administrative domains
       may require the use of their own marking, when this is needed,



Chan, et al.              Expires July 22, 2006                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                  Document                    January 2006


       the original end-to-end service class indication MUST be restored
       upon exit of such administrative domains.

   5.  Each treatment aggregate have limited resource, hence traffic
       conditioning and/or admission control MUST be performed for each
       service class aggregating into the treatment aggregate.


4.  Service Classes to Treatment Aggregate Mapping

   The service class and DSCP selection in Diffserv Service Classes [5]
   has been defined to allow in many instances mapping of two or
   possibly more service classes into a single treatment aggregate.
   Noticing there is a physical-space/time relationship between link
   speed, queue depth, delay, and jitter.  The degree of aggregation,
   hence the number of treatment aggregates, will depend on if the
   domain implementing the aggregation will have link speed high enough
   to minimize the affects of mixing traffic with different packet size,
   different transmit rates on buffering/queue depth, and finally its
   impact on loss, delay, and jitter.  With the general rule of thumb
   being higher link speeds allows higher degree of aggregation/smaller
   number of treatment aggregates.  But all requires some forms of
   traffic conditioning and/or admission control.

4.1.  Mapping Service Classes into Four Treatment Aggregates

   For most of today's high speed links, the use of one network control
   traffic treatment aggregate and three user traffic treatment
   aggregates is sufficient to handle the requirement of all the service
   classes indicated in Diffserv Service Classes [5].  We use the
   performance requirement (tolerance to loss, delay, and jitter) from
   the application/end user as the guidance on how to map the service
   classes into treatment aggregates.  We have also used Section 3.1 of
   RFC 1633 [6] to provide us with guidance on the definition of Real
   Time and Elastic application requirements.  An overview of the
   mapping between service classes and four treatment aggregates is
   provided by Figure 1, with the mapping based on performance
   requirement.

   Notice we recommended certain service classes be mapped into specific
   treatment aggregates.  But this does not mean that all the service
   classes recommended for that treatment aggregate needs to be
   supported.  Hence for a domain, a treatment aggregate may contain a
   subset of the service classes recommended in this document, they
   being the service classes supported by that domain.  A domain's
   treatment of none-supported service classes is that domain's local
   policy.  This local policy may be influenced by its agreement with
   its customers.  Such treatment may use the Elastic Treatment

4.1.1.  Network Control Treatment Aggregate

   The Network Control Treatment Aggregate aggregates all service
   classes that is functionally necessary for the survival of a network
   during a DOS or other high traffic load interval.  The theory is that
   whatever else is true, the network must protect itself.  This

Internet-Draft                  Document                    January 2006


   includes the traffic that Diffserv Service Classes [5] characterizes
   as in the Network Control Service Class.

   The DSCPs of the original service class remain an important
   consideration and should be preserved during aggregation.  Traffic
   bearing these DSCPs is carried in a common queue or class with a PHB
   as described in RFC 2309 [9] and RFC 2474 [4] for CS6.  And for a
   lower probability of packet loss, bearing a relatively deep target
   mean queue depth (min-threshold if RED is being used).

4.1.2.  Real Time Treatment Aggregate

   The Real Time Treatment Aggregate aggregates all real time
   (inelastic) service classes.  The theory is that real-time traffic is
   admitted under some model and controlled by an SLA managed at the
   edge of the network prior to aggregation.  As such, there is a
   predictable and enforceable upper bound on the traffic that can enter
   such a queue, and to provide predictable variation in delay it must
   be protected from bursts of elastic traffic.

   This treatment aggregate may include the following service classes
   from Diffserv Service Classes [5], in addition to other locally
   defined classes: Telephony, Signaling, Multimedia Conferencing, Real-
   time Interactive, Broadcast Video.

   Traffic in each service class that is going to be aggregated into the
   treatment aggregate should be conditioned prior to aggregating.  It
   is recommended that per service class admission control procedure be
   used followed with per service class policing so that any individual
   service class does not generate more than what it is allowed.
   Further, additional admission control and policing may be used on the
   sum of all service classes aggregated.

   The DSCPs of the original service classes remain an important
   consideration and should be preserved during aggregation.  Traffic
   bearing these DSCPs is carried in a common queue or class with a PHB
   as described in RFC 3246 [11] and RFC 3247 [12].

4.1.3.  Assured Elastic Treatment Aggregate

   The Assured Elastic Treatment Aggregate aggregates all elastic
   traffic that uses the Assured Forwarding model as described in RFC
   2597 [10].  The premise of such service is that an SLA is negotiated
   that includes a "committed rate" and the ability to exceed that rate
   (and perhaps a second "excess rate") in exchange for a higher
   probability of loss using AQM [9] or ECN flagging [13] for the
   portion of traffic deemed to be in excess.

   This treatment aggregate may include the following service classes
   from Diffserv Service Classes [5], in addition to other locally
   defined classes: Multimedia Streaming, Low Latency Data, OAM, High
   Throughput Data.

   The DSCPs of the original service classes remain an important
   consideration and should be preserved during aggregation.  Traffic
   bearing these DSCPs is carried in a common queue or class with a PHB
   as described in RFC 2597 [10].  In effect, appropriate target rate
   thresholds have been applied at the edge, dividing traffic into AFn1
   (committed, for any value of n), AFn2, and AFn3 (excess).  The
   service SHOULD be engineered so that AFn1 marked packet flows have
   sufficient bandwidth in the network to provide high assurance of
   delivery.  Since the traffic is elastic and responds dynamically to
   packet loss, Active Queue Management [9] SHOULD be used primarily to
   reduce forwarding rate to the minimum assured rate at congestion
   points.  The probability of loss of AFn1 traffic MUST NOT exceed the
   probability of loss of AFn2 traffic, which in turn MUST NOT exceed
   the probability of loss of AFn3.

   If RED [9] is used as an AQM algorithm, the min-threshold specifies a
   target queue depth for each of AFn1, AFn2, AFn3, and the max-
   threshold specifies the queue depth above which all traffic with such
   a DSCP is dropped or ECN marked.  Thus, in this Treatment Aggregate,
   the following inequality should hold in queue configurations:

   o  min-threshold AFn3 < max-threshold AFn3

   o  max-threshold AFn3 <= min-threshold AFn2

   o  min-threshold AFn2 < max-threshold AFn2

   o  max-threshold AFn2 <= min-threshold AFn1

   o  min-threshold AFn1 < max-threshold AFn1

   o  max-threshold AFn1 <= memory assigned to the queue

   Note: This configuration tends to drop AFn3 traffic before AFn2 and
   AFn2 before AFn1.  Many other AQM algorithms exist and are used; they
   should be configured to achieve a similar result.

4.1.4.  Elastic Treatment Aggregate

   The Elastic Treatment Aggregate aggregates all remaining elastic
   traffic.  The premise of such service is that there is no intrinsic
   SLA differentiation of traffic, but that AQM [9] or ECN flagging [13]
   is appropriate for such traffic.

   This treatment aggregate may include the following service classes
   from Diffserv Service Classes [5], in addition to other locally
   defined classes: Standard, Low Priority Data.

   The DSCPs of the original service classes remain an important
   consideration and should be preserved during aggregation.  Traffic
   bearing these DSCPs is carried in a common queue or class with a PHB
   as described in RFC 2309 [9].  The AQM thresholds for Elastic traffic
   MAY be separately set, so that Low Priority Data traffic is dropped
   before Standard traffic, but this is not a requirement.

   summarized in the following table:

5.  Using MPLS for Treatment Aggregates

   RFC 2983 on DiffServ and Tunnels [7] and RFC 3270 on MPLS Support of
   DiffServ [8] provided very good background on this topic.  This
   document provides an example of using the E-LSP, EXP Inferred PHB
   Scheduled Class (PSC) Label Switched Path (LSP), notion indicated in
   MPLS Support of DiffServ [8] for Treatment Aggregates.

   When Treatment Aggregates are represented in MPLS using EXP Inferred
   PSC LSP, we recommend the following usage of MPLS EXP field for
   Treatment Aggregates.

   Figure 3: Treatment Aggregate and MPLS EXP Field Usage

   Notes *: For Assured Elastic (and Elastic) Treatment Aggregate, the
   usage of 010 or 011 (000 or 001) depends on the drop probability.

   The above table indicates the recommended usage of EXP field for
   Treatment Aggregates.  Because many deployment of MPLS is on a per

   domain basis, each domain have total control of its EXP usage, each
   domain may use a different EXP field allocation for the domain's
   supported Treatment Aggregates.

5.1.  Network Control Treatment Aggregate with E-LSP

   The usage of E-LSP for Network Control Treatment Aggregate needs to
   cohere to the recommendations indicated in section 4.1.1 of this
   document and section 3.2 of Diffserv Service Classes [5].
   Reinforcing these recommendations, there should be no drop precedence
   associated with the MPLS PSC used for Network Control Treatment
   Aggregate because dropping of Network Control Treatment Aggregate
   traffic should be prevented.

5.2.  Real Time Treatment Aggregate with E-LSP

   In addition to the recommendations provided in section 4.1.2 of this
   document and in Diffserv Service Classes [5], we want to indicate
   that Real Time Treatment Aggregate traffic should not be dropped, as
   some of the traffic carried in the Real Time Treatment Aggregate does
   not react well to dropped packets.  As indicated in section 4.1.2 of
   this document, admission control should be performed on each Service
   Class contributing to the Real Time Treatment Aggregate to prevent
   packet loss due to insufficient resource allocated to Real Time
   Treatment Aggregate.  Further, admission control and policing may
   also be applied on the sum of all traffic aggregated into this
   treatment aggregate.

5.3.  Assured Elastic Treatment Aggregate with E-LSP

   EXP field markings of 010 and 011 are used for Assured Elastic
   Treatment Aggregate.  The two encodings are used to provide two
   levels of drop precedence indications, with 010 encoded traffic
   having a lower probability of being drop then 011 encoded traffic.
   This provides for the mapping of CS2, AF31, AF21, and AF11 into EXP
   010; and AF32, AF22, AF12 and AF33, AF23, AF13 into EXP 011.

5.4.  Elastic Treatment Aggregate with E-LSP

   EXP field markings of 000 and 001 are used for Elastic Treatment
   Aggregate.  The two encodings are used to provide two levels of drop
   precedence indications, with 000 encoded traffic having a lower
   probability of being drop then 001 encoded traffic.  This provides
   for the mapping of Default/CS0 into 000; and CS1 into 001.  Notice
   with this mapping, during congestion, CS1 marked traffic may be
   starved.

5.5.  Treatment Aggregates and L-LSP

   Because L-LSP (Label Only Inferred PSC LSP) supports a single PSC per
   LSP, the support of each Treatment Aggregate is on a per LSP basis.
   This document does not further specify any additional recommendation
   (beyond what had been indicated in section 4 of this document) for
   Treatment Aggregate to L-LSP mapping, leaving this to each individual
   MPLS domain administration.


6.  Treatment Aggregates and Inter Provider Relationships

   When Treatment Aggregates are used at the provider boundaries, we
   recommend the Inter Provider Relationship be based on Diffserv
   Service Classes [5].  This allows the admission control into each
   Treatment Aggregate of a provider domain be based on the admission
   control of traffic into the supported Service Classes, as indicated
   by the discussions in section 4 of this document.

   If the Inter Provider Relationship needs to be based on Treatment
   Aggregates specified by this document, the exact Treatment Aggregate
   content and representation must be agreed between the peering
   providers.


7.  Security Considerations

   This document discusses policy of using Differentiated Services and
   its service classes.  If implemented as described, it should require
   the network to do nothing that the network has not already allowed.
   If that is the case, no new security issues should arise from the use
   of such a policy.

   It is possible for the policy to be applied incorrectly, or for a
   wrong policy to be applied in the network for the defined
   aggregation.  In that case, a policy issue exists that the network
   must detect, assess, and deal with.  This is a known security issue
   in any network dependent on policy-directed behavior.

   A well known flaw appears when bandwidth is reserved or enabled for a
   service (for example, voice transport) and another service or an
   attacking traffic stream uses it.  This possibility is inherent in
   DiffServ technology, which depends on appropriate packet markings.
   When bandwidth reservation or a priority queuing system is used in a
   vulnerable network, the use of authentication and flow admission is
   recommended.  To the author's knowledge, there is no known technical
   way to respond to or act upon a data stream that has been admitted
   for service but that it is not intended for authenticated use.
