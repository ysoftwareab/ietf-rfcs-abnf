1.  Introduction

   Loops are a well-known configuration error in DNS zones.  CNAME loops
   were first documented in [RFC1034], and can occur when two domains
   point to each other.  For example:

   .org zone file:

        example.org CNAME example.com

   .com zone file:

       example.com CNAME example.org

   [RFC1536] states that "a set of servers might form a loop wherein A
   refers to B and B refers to A".  Although RFC1536 did not explicitly
   define other types of loops, others can also occur using NS records,
   as shown in the example below:

   .org zone file:

       example.org NS  ns1.example.com

       example.org NS  ns2.example.com

   .com zone file:

       example.com NS  ns1.example.org

   example.com NS  ns2.example.org

   In both the CNAME and NS loop cases, recursive resolvers will not be
   able to resolve these domain names, or any child domains underneath
   these zones.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Past solutions

   The first solution was proposed in RFC1034, which states that CNAME
   loops should be "signalled (sic) as an error" (Section 3.6.2).  To
   avoid resolvers starting to loop infinitely in presence of
   configuration errors, RFC1034 also recommends that resolvers limit
   the number of queries it sends out when resolving an individual
   domain name.  [RFC1035] stipulates that resolvers should use counters
   to implement these limits.

   Later, [RFC1536] states that "a set of servers might form a loop
   wherein A refers to B and B refers to A".  It does not, however,
   specify what type of records might create these loops.  Additionally,
   it offers no new solutions beyond what RFC1034 and RFC1035 suggested.

   In short, [RFC1034], [RFC1035] and [RFC1536] describe the problem and
   do provide guidance to resolver implementers to help avoid indefinite
   loops in the presence of misconfigured zone files with NS or CNAME
   loops.  However, we continue to observe different forms of this
   problem and so here we seek to clarify that guidance.

3.  Current Problem

   Recent research[Moura21b] has shown how NS configuration loops can
   lead to significant increases in traffic: New Zealand's .nz country-
   code top-level domain (a ccTLD) experienced a 50% traffic surge when
   two domains were misconfigured with NS loops.  Another anonymous
   European ccTLD saw its traffic grow by 10-fold when two subdomains
   were also miscofigured with NS loops.  [Moura21b] also reproduced the
   experiments under multiple controlled scenarios.

   If existing RFCs already provide solution for looping
   misconfiguration (Section 2), how come recent research [Moura21b]
   still showed that these loops exist in the wild and lead to such
   traffic surges?

3.1.  Root Causes of Traffic Surge

   [Moura21b] documents two main sources of amplification in the
   presence of NS loops:

   *  Looping recursive resolvers: these are resolvers that send non-
      stop queries to authoritative servers after receiving a single
      client query (Figure 1) targeting a domain with an NS loop.  Such
      recursive resolvers do not conform to the guidance in RFC1034 and
      RFC1035, both of which set limits to the number queries a resolver
      should send when resolving a name.

   *  Looping clients, stub-resolvers, and forwarders: another situation
      occurs when parts of the DNS infrastructure, behind a recursive
      resolver, send non-stop queries in the presence of NS loops.
      These queries ultimately reach their upstream recursive resolvers,
      which then send queries to authoritative servers (and which
      themselves may further amplify the query stream).

   To illustrate this, consider Figure 1.  The Current RFCs provide
   solutions to prevent recursive resolvers from looping.  Assume a
   client sends a query to its stub resolver, which they will forward to
   one of its locally configured recursive resovlers (Re1 and Re2).
   Assuming Re2 receives the query, it will then carry out the recursive
   recursion tasks.  The current solutions limit the number of queries
   that Re2 will send to authoritative servers (AT2) when resolving the
   domain -- so the recursive resolver itself prevents looping.  The
   recursive resolver should answer the client with a SERVFAIL error
   code in response.

   However, this does not protect clients, stubs, or DNS forwarders (as
   Re1, which forwards to Re3) to start to repeatedly asking the same
   query.  If, for example, Re2 sends up to 20 queries when resolving a

   domain name, every new incoming client query can trigger up to new 20
   queries.  This was exactly the problem the researchers found in
   Google Public DNS' implementation.

4.  New requirement

   Besides following the recommendations from RFC1034, RFC1035 and
   RFC2181 for handling loops, this memo requires that recursive
   resolvers MUST detect loop and MUST cache these records (negative
   caching)[RFC2308].  Recursive resolvers need to refrain from
   forwarding queries from clients/stub/forwarders to misconfigured
   domain names when a negative answer can be answered from its cache.

   How long these loops should be cached for is an implementation
   choice; however, recursive results MUST answer from it's cache for at
   least 15 minutes, given that most looping NS/CNAME record situations
   will require human intervention.

7.  Privacy Considerations

   This document does not add any practical new privacy issues, aside
   from possible benefits in deploying longer TTLs which in turn
   requires less traffic to be sent and thus preserves privacy by query
   omission: longer TTLs may help preserve a user's privacy by reducing
   the number of requests that get transmitted in both the client-to-
   resolver and resolver-to-authoritative cases.
