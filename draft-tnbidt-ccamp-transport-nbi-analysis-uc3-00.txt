Internet-Draft        T-NBI Use Case 3 Analysis            October 2017


1. Introduction

   This document analyses how YANG models developed by IETF (TEAS and
   CCAMP WG) can be used to support Use Case 3 (multi-domain with
   single-layer) scenarios as described in [TNBI-UseCases].

1.1. Assumptions

   This document is using the ACTN [ACTN-Fwk] as an architecture that
   deploys the IETF models. The motivation of this draft is to analyze
   how existing IETF models can be used on the MPI between the PNC and
   the MDSC to support the use case 3 scenarios as defined in section 6
   of [TNBI-UseCases].

   This document assumes the applicability of the YANG models to the
   ACTN interfaces as defined in [ACTN-YANG] and therefore considers the
   TE Topology YANG model defined in [TE-TOPO], with the OTN Topology
   augmentation defined in [OTN-TOPO] and the TE Tunnel YANG model
   defined in [TE-TUNNEL], with the OTN Tunnel augmentation defined in
   [OTN-TUNNEL].

   In this document, the assumptions made in section 1 of [TNBI-UseCase-
   1] still apply. In summary, it is assumed that 1) MDSC uses the
   explicit-route-object list on MPI to specify the ingress/egress links
   for a tunnel segment request, and 2) label and TS availability
   information are reported from PNC to MDSC.

1.2. Feedbacks provided to the IETF Working Groups

   The analysis done in this version of this document has triggered the
   following feedbacks to TEAS WG:

   o  Updates to the plug-id definition in [TE-TOPO] to support plug-id
      also when auto-discovery (e.g., LMP based) mechanisms are used on
      inter-domain links

2. Conventions used in this document

   The conventions defined in section 2 of [TNBI-UseCase-1] still apply
   in this document.

3. Scenario Overview

   Use Case 3 is described in [TNBI-Use Cases] as a multi-domain with
   single layer network scenario supporting different types of services.
   This section provides a high-level overview of how IETF YANG models

   can be used to support these uses cases at the MPI between the
   Transport PNC and the MDSC.

   Section 3.1 describes the different topology abstractions provided to
   the MDSC by each PNC via its own MPI. The reference network and
   controlling hierarchy is defined in section 6.1 of [TNBI-Use Cases].

   Section 3.2 describes how the difference services, defined in section
   6.3 of [TNBI-UseCases], can be setup by the MDSC by coordinating
   requests to each PNC via their own MPIs.

   Section 3.3 describes how the protection scenarios can be deployed,
   including end-to-end protection and segment protection, for both
   intra-domain and inter-domain scenario.

3.1. Topology Abstractions

   The reference network is shown in Figure 1, which is the same as
   Figure 3 of [TNBI-UseCases]:

                         Figure 1 Reference Topology

   The network is portioned in three domains with inter-domain links
   connecting the domains with each other. The controlling hierarchy is
   shown in Figure 3 of [TNBI-UseCases]: the three PNCs are responsible
   for the topology abstraction and device configuration for their
   respective domains, and the MDSC is used to coordinate the 3 domains.

   3.1.1. Single Domain Topology

   Each PNC reports its respective topology to the MDSC with different
   abstraction method, as described in section 6.2 of [TNBI-UseCases].

Internet-Draft        T-NBI Use Case 3 Analysis            October 2017


   The physical topology of domain 1 and the topology abstraction (i.e.,
   white topology abstraction) provided by PNC1 are the same as those
   described in section 3.1.1 of [TNBI-UseCase-1] for the single domain
   topology abstraction use case.

   PNC2 provides a "type A grey topology abstraction": only one abstract
   node (i.e., AN2), with only inter-domain and access links, is
   reported at the MPI2.

   PNC3 provides a "type B grey topology abstraction": two abstract
   nodes (i.e., AN31 and AN32), with internal links, inter-domain links
   and access links, are reported at the MPI3.

   3.1.2. Multi-domain Topology Stitching

   As assumed in the beginning of this section, MDSC does not have any
   knowledge of the topologies of each domain until each PNC reports its
   own abstraction topology, so the MDSC needs to merge together the
   abstract topologies provided by different PNCs, at the MPIs, to build
   its own topology view, as described in section 4.3 of [TE-TOPO].

   Given the topologies reported from multiple PNCs, the MDSC need to
   stitch the multi-domain topology and obtain the full map of topology.
   The topology of each domain main be in an abstracted shape (refer to
   section 5.2 of [ACTN-Fwk]for different level of abstraction), while
   the inter-domain link information MUST be complete and fully
   configured by the MDSC.

   The inter-domain link information is reported to the MDSC by the two
   PNCs, controlling the two ends of the inter-domain link.

   The MDSC needs to understand how to "stitch" together these inter-
   domain links.

   One possibility is to use the plug-id information, defined in [TE-
   TOPO]: two inter-domain links reporting the same plug-id value can be
   merged as a single intra-domain link within any MDSC native topology.
   The value of the reported plug-id information can be either assigned
   by a central network authority, and configured within the two PNC
   domains, or it can be discovered using automatic discovery mechanisms
   (e.g., LMP-based, as defined in [RFC6898]).

   In case the plug-id values are assigned by a central authority, it is
   under the central authority responsibility to assign unique values.

   In case the plug-id values are automatically discovered, the
   information discovered by the automatic discovery mechanisms needs to


Zheng, Busi et al.      Expires April 30, 2018                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        T-NBI Use Case 3 Analysis            October 2017


   be encoded as a bit string within the plug-id value. This encoding is
   implementation specific but the encoding rules need to be consistent
   across all the PNCs.

   In case of co-existence within the same network of multiple sources
   for the plug-id (e.g., central authority and automatic discovery or
   even different automatic discovery mechanisms), it is RECOMMENDED
   that the plug-id namespace is partitioned to avoid that different
   sources assign the same plug-id value to different inter-domain link.
   The encoding of the plug-id namespace within the plug-id value is
   implementation specific but needs to be consistent across all the
   PNCs.

   Another possibility is to pre-configure, either in the adjacent PNCs
   or in the MDSC, the association between the inter-domain link
   identifiers (topology-id, node-id and tp-id) assigned by the two
   adjacent PNCs to the same inter-domain link.

   This option requires further investigation.

3.2. Multi-domain Service Configuration

   Multi-domain service configuration can be found in section 6.3 of
   [TNBI-Usecases].

   As an example, the objective in this section is to configure a
   transport service between C-R1 and C-R5. The cross-domain routing is
   assumed to be C-R1 <-> S3 <-> S2 <-> S31 <-> S33 <-> S34 <->S15 <->
   S18 <-> C-R5.

   According to the different client signal type, there is different
   adaptation required. In this document, we are trying our best to
   reuse what has been defined in [TNBI-UseCase-1], which is the single
   domain case.

   3.2.1. Procedure Description

   The service configuration procedure is assumed to be initiated (step
   1 in Figure 2) at the CMI from CNC to MDSC, using XXX(LxSM,
   transport-service, VN, TBD) service models. The MDSC will understand
   this configure as as a request to setup a service from node A to node
   Z. Analysis of the CMI models is for further study.

   After receiving such request, MDSC determines the domain sequence,
   i.e., domain 1 <-> domain 2 <-> domain 3, with corresponding PNCs and
   inter-domain links (step 1 in Figure 2).

   As described in [PATH-COMPUTE], the domain sequence can be determined
   by running the MDSC own path computation on the MDSC internal
   topology, defined in section 3.1.2, if and only if the MDSC has
   enough topology information. Otherwise the MDSC can send path
   computation requests to the different PNCs (steps 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 in


Zheng, Busi et al.      Expires April 30, 2018                 [Page 8]

   Figure 2) and use this information to determine the optimal path on
   its internal topology and therefore the domain sequence.

   The MDSC will then decompose the tunnel request into a few tunnel
   segments via tunnel model (including both TE tunnel model and OTN
   tunnel model), and request different PNCs to setup each intra-domain
   tunnel segment (steps 3, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 in Figure 2).

   Assume that each intra-domain tunnel segment can be set up
   successfully, and each PNC response to the MDSC respectively. Based
   on each segment, MDSC will take care of the configuration of both the
   intra-domain tunnel segment and inter-domain tunnel via corresponding
   MPI (via TE tunnel model and OTN tunnel model). More specifically,
   for the inter-domain configuration, the ts bitmap and tpn information
   need to be configured via OTN tunnel model. . Then the end-to-end OTN
   tunnel will be ready.

   In any case, the access link configuration is done only on the PNCs
   that control the access links (e.g., PNC-1 and PNC-3 in our example)
   and not on the PNCs of transit domain (e.g., PNC-2 in our example).
   Access link will be configured by MDSC after the OTN tunnel is set
   up. Access configuration is different and dependent on the different
   type of service. More details can be found in the following sections.
