Abstract

   Full internationalization of electronic mail requires not only the
   capability to transmit non-ASCII content, to encode selected
   information in specific header fields, and to use non-ASCII
   characters in envelope addresses.  It also requires being able to
   express those addresses and information based on them in mail header
   fields.  This document specifies the use of Unicode encoded in UTF-8,
   rather than ASCII, as the base form for Internet email header field
   bodies.  This form is permitted in transmission only if authorized by

Internet-Draft             I18N Email Headers               October 2006


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Role of this specification

   Full internationalization of electronic mail requires several
   capabilities:

   o  The capability to transmit non-ASCII content, provided for as part
      of the basic MIME specification [RFC2045], [RFC2046].
   o  The capability to encode selected information in specific header
      fields, provided for as another part of the MIME specification
      [RFC2047].
   o  The capability to use international characters in envelope
      addresses, discussed in [EAI-overview] and specified in
      [EAI-SMTP-extension].  And, finally,
   o  The capability to express those addresses, and information related
      to and based on them, in mail header fields, defined in this
      document.
   o  The capability to use international characters in other headers,
      but only as expressly permitted herein, or in future extensions.

   This document specifies the use of Unicode encoded in UTF-8
   [RFC3629], rather than ASCII, as the base form for Internet email
   header fields.  This form is permitted in transmission, if authorized
   by the SMTP extension specified in [EAI-SMTP-extension] or by other
   transport mechanisms capable of processing it.


2.  Background and History

   Mailbox names often represent the names of human users.  Many of
   these users throughout the world have names that are not normally
   represented with just the ASCII repertoire of characters, and would
   more or less like to use their real names in their mailbox names.
   These users are also likely to use non-ASCII text in their common
   names and subjects of email messages, both in what they send and what
   they receive.  This protocol specifies UTF-8 as the encoding to
   represent email header field bodies.

   The traditional format of email messages [RFC2822] allows only ASCII
   characters in the header fields of messages.  This prevents users
   from having email addresses that contain non-ASCII characters.  It
   further forces non-ASCII text in common names, comments, and in free
   text (such as in the Subject: field) to be in MIME format [RFC2047].
   This specification describes a change to the email message format
   that is related to the SMTP message transport change described in the
   associated specifications [EAI-overview] and [EAI-SMTP-extension],
   and that allows non-ASCII characters throughout email header fields.

Internet-Draft             I18N Email Headers               October 2006


   These changes affect SMTP clients, SMTP servers, mail user agents
   (MUAs), list expanders and and gateways to other media.

   As specified in [EAI-SMTP-extension], an SMTP protocol extension
   "UTF8SMTP" is used to prevent the transmission of messages with UTF-8
   header fields to systems that cannot handle such messages.

   Use of this SMTP extension helps prevent against the introduction of
   such messages into message stores that might misrepresent or mangle
   such messages.  It should be noted that using an ESMTP extension does
   not prevent against transferring email messages with UTF-8 header
   fields to other systems that use the email format for messages and
   that may not be upgraded, such as the POP and IMAP protocols.  Those
   protocols also need to be changed in order to handle stored messages
   that have UTF-8 header fields.

   The objective for this protocol is to allow UTF-8 in email header
   fields.  Issues about how to handle messages that contain UTF-8
   header fields but are proposed to be delivered to systems that have
   not been upgraded to support this capability are discussed elsewhere,
   particularly in [EAI-downgrading].


3.  Terminology

   In this document, header fields are "UTF-8 headers" if the bodies of
   those headers contain UTF-8 characters.

   Unless otherwise noted, all terms used here are defined in [RFC2821]
   or [RFC2822] or in [EAI-overview].

   The key words "MUST", "SHALL", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "RECOMMENDED",
   and "MAY" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   This document is being discussed on the ima mailing list.  See
   https://www1.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ima for information about
   subscribing.  The list's archive is at
   http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ima/index.html.


4.  Pre-requirement

   The use of UTF-8 header fields is dependent on the use of an SMTP
   extension named "UTF8SMTP" or of similar capabilities in other
   transports.

   That protocol is defined in [EAI-SMTP-extension].  If that extension



Yeh                      Expires April 26, 2007                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft             I18N Email Headers               October 2006


   is not supported, UTF-8 header fields MUST NOT be transmitted by
   SMTP.

   Sending MUAs that follow this protocol MUST create all header fields
   encoded in UTF-8.  No other direct encodings (like Big-5) are
   allowed.  Although there is nothing wrong with the continued use of
   [RFC2047], it is not recommended in this document.


5.  Identification of internationalized email

   When a SMTP client tries to send a mail to a SMTP server that does
   not support UTF8SMTP, the client should know whether the message
   requires the support for UTF8SMTP or not.  In addition to this,
   identification of internationalized email is also required when a
   message is stored and resent.  Checking the presence of UTF-8
   characters in the header whenever such an identification is required
   may also achieve the goal.  However, this type of repeated processing
   wastes time and processing power of involved systems.  It is nice to
   have a mechanism (such as self-label) or some indicator to identify
   whether the message is in the new format(i.e.  UTF8SMTP compliant) or
   old one (i.e.  RFC 2822 compliant).

   To be able to do so, sending MUA MUST insert a new header field to
   identify the presence of i18n information (particularly UTF-8
   headers) in the message.  The new header specified as "Header-Type",
   and elements of the header is the header type of i18n email.  The
   i18n header field syntax specified as below:

   header-content  = "Header-Type:" [FWS] content-code [FWS]
                     *( ";" parameter ) CRLF
                                   ; parameter is defined on RFC 2045
   content-code    = "UTF8" / "ASCII" / "Downgraded"

   There are three kinds of header type.  "UTF8SMTP" indicates that the
   message is in the format defined by this document; "ASCII" indicates
   that it is in the format defined by RFC 2822 (and is the default when
   this header field is absent); and "Downgraded" indicates the same as
   "ASCII", but also that it was earlier downgraded from "UTF8SMTP".

   The "header-language" parameter is defined for "Header-Type" header-
   field.  Value of "header-language" parameter is defined as following:

   header-language-value = Language-Tag [CFWS]
                           *("," [CFWS] Language-Tag [CFWS])
                           ; Language-Tag is defined in RFC4646

   if there is more than one Language-Tag, the "header-language-value"

   has to be turned into a <quoted-string> because "," cannot appear in
   a <token>.

   The "required-fields" parameter is defined for "Header-Type" header-
   field.  Value of "required-fields" parameter is defined as following:

   required-fields-value = field-name [FWS]
                           *("," [FWS] field-name [FWS])
                           ; the term <field-name> is defined in RFC2822

   While we can't require ordering of headers, it would be good to have
   it appear as near the top of the headers as possible.  It would also
   be good to be able to guarantee that it will be there when the
   message is dropped into a mail store.  Thus, when a i18n email is
   generated.

   o  The "UTF8SMTP" header field MUST be inserted by the originating
      MUA.
   o  Whenever the email is downgraded, the content-code of the
      "UTF8SMTP" MUST change to "Downgraded", the detail of downgrade
      process will be described in [EAI-downgrading].


6.  Changes on Message Header Fields

   SMTP client can send header fields in UTF-8 format, if the UTF8SMTP
   extension advertised by SMTP server or as permitted by other
   transport mechanisms.

   This protocol does NOT change the definition of header field names.
   That is, only the bodies of header fields are allowed to have UTF-8
   characters; the rules in RFC 2822 for header names are not changed.
   To be able to do so, the header definition in RFC 2822 must extended
   to support new format.  That following ABNF is defined to substitute
   those definition in RFC 2822.

   For those syntax rules not referred in this section remains as the
   original definition in RFC 2822.

6.1.  UTF8 Syntax

   The use of UTF8 characters are defined as following.

   UTF8-xtra-char  =   UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4

   UTF8-2          =   %xC2-DF UTF8-tail

   UTF8-3          =   %xE0 %xA0-BF UTF8-tail /
                       %xE1-EC 2(UTF8-tail) /
                       %xED %x80-9F UTF8-tail /
                       %xEE-EF 2(UTF8-tail)

   UTF8-4          =   %xF0 %x90-BF 2(UTF8-tail) /
                       %xF1-F7 3(UTF8-tail)

   UTF8-tail       =   %x80-BF

   These are taken from FRC 3629, but kept in this document for reasons
   of convenience.
   [Note in draft: Weather normalizing is needed or not will be place in
   here.]

6.2.  Syntax extend from RFC 2822

   The following rules are intended to extend the corresponding rules in
   RFC 2822 to allow UTF8 characters.

   ctext   =  NO-WS-CTL /     ; all of <text> except
              %d33-39 /       ; SP, HTAB, "(", ")"
              %d42-91 /       ; and "\"
              %d93-126 /
              UTF8-xtra-char

   qtext   =       NO-WS-CTL /     ; all of <text> except
              %d33 /               ; The rest of the US-ASCII
              %d35-91 /        ; characters not including "\"
              %d93-126 /       ; or the quote character
              UTF8-xtra-char

   text    =  %d1-9 /         ; all UTF-8 characters except
              %d11-12 /       ; US-ASCII NUL, CR and LF
              %d14-127 /
              UTF8-xtra-char

   utext   =  NO-WS-CTL /     ; Non white space controls
              %d33-126 /      ; The rest of US-ASCII
              UTF8-xtra-char

   This means that all the RFC 2822 constructs that build upon these
   will permit UTF-8 characters, including comments and quoted strings.
   Besides, in order to allow UTF8 characters in <addr-spec> we have to

Internet-Draft             I18N Email Headers               October 2006


   change the syntax of <atext>.  However, it will also lead <mesg-id>
   to allow UTF8 characters, which is not allowed due to the limitation
   describe in Section 6.4.  So <utf8-atext> is added to meet this
   requirement.

   utf8-atext   =  ALPHA / DIGIT /
                   "!" / "#" /     ; Any character except
                   "$" / "%" /     ; controls, SP, and specials.
                   "&" / "'" /     ; Used for atoms
                   "*" / "+" /
                   "-" / "/" /
                   "=" / "?" /
                   "^" / "_" /
                   "`" / "{" /
                   "|" / "}" /
                   "~" /
                   UTF8-xtra-char

   utf8-atom     = [CFWS] 1*utf8-atext [CFWS]

   utf8-dot-atom = [CFWS] utf8-dot-atom-text [CFWS]

   utf8-dot-atom-text = 1*utf8-atext *("." 1*utf8-atext)

   [NOTE IN DRAFT: If any header needs to be restricted to disallow
   this, please raise the issue on the mailing list.]
   Note, however, that this does not remove any constraint on the
   character set of protocol elements; for instance, all the allowed
   values for timezone in the Date: headers are still expressed in
   ASCII.

6.3.  Change on addr-spec syntax

   In this specification, internationalized email address will be
   presented in UTF-8.  Thus, all header fields involving <mailbox>es
   may be different from traditional ones.  There might be UTF8SMTP
   unaware MTAs in the mail routing path.  In that case, MTA may bounce
   the message with reply code 550, or downgrade the non-ASCII contents
   of all header bodies before continuing to send the message.  The
   downgrade process involve with a new ALT-ADDRESS parameter.  When
   downgrade occurs, the ALT-ADDRESS will be used for mail delivery
   instead of the internationalized email address, the detail is
   described in [EAI-downgrading].

   angle-addr     =  [CFWS] "<" utf8-addr-spec [alt-address] ">" [CFWS]

   utf8-addr-spec =  utf8-local-part "@" utf8-domain

   utf8-local-part=  utf8-dot-atom / quoted-string / obs-local-part

   utf8-domain    =  utf8-dot-atom / domain-literal / obs-domain

   alt-address    =  [CFWS] "[" addr-spec "]" [CFWS]

   Below list a few possible <mailbox> representation as example.


      "DISPLAY_NAME" <ASCII@ASCII>
         ; traditional mailbox format

      "DISPLAY_NAME" <non-ASCII@non-ASCII>
         ; UTF8SMTP but no ALT-ADDRESS parameter provided,
         ; message will bounce if UTF8SMTP extension is not supported

      "DISPLAY_NAME" <non-ASCII@non-ASCII [ASCII@ASCII]>
         ; UTF8SMTP with ALT-ADDRESS parameter provided,
         ; ALT-ADDRESS can be used if downgrade is necessary

6.4.  Trace field syntax

   Internationalized domain names in Received fields must be transmitted
   in punycode form.  "For" fields containing internationalized
   addresses are prohibited, since subsequent downgrading would force
   violating rules in RFC 2821 prohibiting altering existing Received
   fields.  With these two restrictions, there should be no need for
   UTF-8 information in Received fields and such information is
   prohibited to preserve the integrity of those fields.  More
   generally, UTF-8 information of any sort MUST NOT appear in Received
   fields, even in comments within those fields.


7.  Additional issue

   This section identifies issues that are not covered as part of this
   set of specifications, but that will need to be considered as part of
   UTF8SMTP deployment.

7.1.  Mailing list header fields

   All mailing list and mail redistribution related header fields may
   need further discuss.

Internet-Draft             I18N Email Headers               October 2006


7.2.  MIME headers

   The syntax of <value&gt, as defined in RFC 2045, is

   value   =       token / quoted-string

   In all those headers, such as Content-Type and Content-Dispoaition
   [and maybe our own Header-Type, plus lots of others being defined in
   various other documents], which make use of <value&gts within
   <parameter&gts as defined in [RFC2045] as modified by [RFC2231], it
   will now be allowed to use <quoted-string>s containing UTF-8
   characters (see the revised syntax of <qtext> in Section 6.2 of this
   document).


8.  Security Considerations

   If a user has a non-ASCII mailbox address and an ASCII mailbox
   address, a digital certificate that identifies that user may have
   both addresses in the identity.  Having multiple email addresses as
   identities in a single certificate is already supported in PKIX and
   OpenPGP.

   Because UTF-8 often requires several octets to encode a single
   character, internationalized local parts may cause mail addresses to
   become longer.  As specified in RFC 2822, each line of characters
   MUST be no more 998 octets, excluding the CRLF.

   In this specification, a user could provide an ASCII alternative
   address for a non-ASCII address.  However, it is possible these two
   address go to different mailbox, or even different persons.  This
   might not be a protocol problem, but the user's personal choice or
   administration policy or even be a deliberate attempt to deceive or
   cause confusion.


9.  IANA considerations

   IANA is requested to register the following header fields in the
   Permanent Message Header Field Repository, in accordance with the
   procedures set out in [RFC3864].

   Header field name: Header-Type
   Applicable protocol: mail
   Status: experimental
   Author/change controller: IETF
   Specification document(s): This document (Section 5)
