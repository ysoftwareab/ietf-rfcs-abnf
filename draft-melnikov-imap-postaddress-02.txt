Abstract

    The POSTADDRESS extension of the Internet Message Access
    Protocol [IMAP4] permits a client to discover an email address
    that can be used to send messages to an IMAP mailbox.


1.   Conventions Used in this Document

    In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
    server respectively.

    In all examples "/" character is used as hierarchy separator.

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [KEYWORDS].


2.   Introduction and Overview

    IMAP POSTADDRESS extension can be used to discover an email address
    for a given IMAP mailbox. Many email clients support saving a copy
    of an outgoing message in "sent messages" or "outbox" mailbox.
    Typically, those email clients send the message first using SMTP.
    After that they upload a copy of the message using IMAP APPEND.
    Effectively, the message is sent twice: once using SMTP and once
    using IMAP. If the IMAP server supports the POSTADDRESS extension,
    the mail client can avoid uploading a copy of the message using
    IMAP APPEND. This can be achieved by specifying an additional recipient,
    returned by LIST (POSTADDRESS) command, during the SMTP transaction.

    A server that supports POSTADDRESS parameter to the LIST command SHALL
    return "POSTADDRESS" in its capability response.


3. LIST command with the POSTADDRESS parameter

    This document defines a new return option POSTADDRESS to the LIST command
    that requests the server to return an email address that can be used to post
    email to a mailbox returned by the LIST command. The POSTADDRESS return
    option causes the server to return LIST with POSTADDRESS information
    (see section 4).

    If posting to the mailbox is not allowed or not supported the server
    MUST return NIL. For example, if the server also supports [ACL] extension
    and if the user that is issuing LIST (POSTADDRESS) is not granted the "p" right
    on the mailbox (the "p" right might be granted to the user directly, or
    through one of the groups the user belongs to, e.g. it may be granted to
    the "anonymous"), the extended LIST response MUST return NIL in POSTADDRESS
    information. Note, that the last requirement doesn't eliminate the need
    for the SMTP server to enforce access controls on delivery, as the returned
    email address may be passed by the IMAP client to a third party, not trusted
    by the SMTP server.

    Also note, that if the server also supports [ACL] extension and if the user
    doesn't have either "l" or "r" right on the mailbox, the server MUST NOT
    disclose the mailbox existence.

    Example:    C: A002 LIST () "" INBOX RETURN (POSTADDRESS)
                S: * LIST () "/" INBOX (("POSTADDRESS" "user1@example.com"))
                S: A002 OK List with postaddress info completed

    Note that the empty () after the LIST command name are not required,
    which is shown below:

    Example:    C: A002 LIST () "" inbox.Drafts RETURN (POSTADDRESS)
                S: * LIST () "/" inbox.Drafts (("POSTADDRESS" NIL))
                S: A002 OK List with postaddress info completed

    The following 2 examples demonstrate email addresses that require
    RFC 2821 quoting of the localpart:

    Example:    C: A002 LIST () "" "foo bar" RETURN (POSTADDRESS)
                S: * LIST () "/" "foo bar" (("POSTADDRESS"
                   "\"user1+foo bar\"@example.com")) 
                S: A002 OK List with postaddress info completed

    Example:    C: A002 LIST () "" "foo bar" RETURN (POSTADDRESS)
                S: * LIST () "/" "foo bar" (("POSTADDRESS" {27}
                S: "user1+foo bar"@example.com)) 
                S: A002 OK List with postaddress info completed


4. Extended LIST response with POSTADDRESS information

    Contents:   name attributes
                hierarchy delimiter
                mailbox name
                email address for posting to the mailbox

      This version of LIST response occurs as a result of a LIST
      (POSTADDRESS) command. The proposed syntax conforms to the syntax of
      an extended LIST response as defined by mbox-list-extended ABNF
      element of [LISTEXT].

      The meaning of "name attributes" and "hierarchy delimiter" is
      described in section 7.2.2 of [IMAP4]. This is followed by the
      extension part that includes "POSTADDRESS" tag followed by an email
      address that can be used to post email to the mailbox.
      The returned email address MUST match the "Mailbox" ABNF production
      from [SMTP]. If no such address exists for the a mailbox, the server
      MUST return NIL. Also note, that any returned email address may
      be subject to user-controlled delivery filtering, such as [Sieve],
      which may cause a message to be delivered into a different mailbox.

    Example:    S: * LIST () "/" Sent (("POSTADDRESS" "user+Sent@example.com"))


5.   Formal Syntax

    Formal syntax is defined using ABNF [ABNF] as modified by [IMAP4].
    Non-terminals referenced but not defined below are as defined by
    [IMAP4] or [LISTEXT].

    Except as noted otherwise, all alphabetic characters are
    case-insensitive.  The use of upper or lower case characters to
    define token strings is for editorial clarity only.  Implementations
    MUST accept these strings in a case-insensitive fashion.

    return-option   =/ "POSTADDRESS"
                      ;; <return-option> is defined in [LISTEXT]

    postaddr_data   = "(" <"> "POSTADDRESS" <"> SP email_address ")"
                      ;; postaddr_data conforms to the syntax of
                      ;; mbox-list-extended-item from [LISTEXT]

    email_address   = nstring
                      ;; NIL if email address is not known


6.   Security Considerations

    Unless proper access restrictions are implemented, the POSTADDRESS
    extension can be used by a user to harvest email addresses.

    Additional security considerations are discussed in Section 3.


7.   IANA Considerations

    IANA is requested to register the following LISTEXT return option
    as specified in [LISTEXT]:


     To: iana@iana.org
     Subject: Registration of LISTEXT option POSTADDRESS

     LISTEXT option name: POSTADDRESS

     LISTEXT option type: RETURN

     LISTEXT option description: Causes the LIST command to return
          email address (if any) for posting to a returned mailbox.

     Published specification : this RFC, section 3.

     Security considerations: this RFC, section 6.

     Intended usage: COMMON
