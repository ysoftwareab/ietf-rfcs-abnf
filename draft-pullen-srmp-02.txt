Abstract

   The Selectively Reliable Multicast Protocol (SRMP) is a transport
   protocol, intended to deliver a mix of reliable and best-effort 
   messages in an any-to-any multicast environment, where the best-
   effort traffic occurs in significantly greater volume than the 
   reliable traffic and therefore can be used to carry sequence 
   numbers of reliable messages for loss detection. SRMP is intended 
   for use in a distributed simulation application environment, where 
   only the latest value of reliable transmission for any particular 
   data identifier requires delivery.

Internet Draft            draft-pullen-srmp-02.txt            March 2003

   SRMP has two sublayers: a bundling sublayer that combines short 
   messages, peforms NAK suppression, and incorporates the TCP-Friendly 
   Multicast Congestion Control of Widmer and Handley, dropping best-
   effort traffic in order to achieve congestion control; and a 
   selectively reliable transport (SRT) sublayer that formats best-
   effort and reliable transmissions and also creates negative 
   acknowledgements when loss of reliable messages is detected.

   In SRMP, selection between reliable and best-effort messages is
   performed by the application. The protocol bundles messages within
   a configured time interval, attempting to achieve a configured
   bundle size which typically is set to the expected smallest MTU
   in the delivery path. The bundle header carries the latest sequence
   number for each reliable transmission. Rate reduction is achieved
   when necessary by dropping best-effort messages at random.

1. Introduction

   There is no viable generic approach to achieving reliable transport
   over multicast networks. Existing successful approaches require that
   the transport protocol take advantage of special properties of the
   traffic. The protocol described here is applicable to real-time
   traffic containing a mix of two categories of messages: a small
   fraction requiring reliable delivery, mixed with a predominating 
   flow of best-effort messages. This sort of traffic is associated 
   with distributed virtual simulation (RFC2402 [1]) and also with some
   forms of distributed multimedia conferencing.  These applications
   typically have some data that changes rarely, or not at all, so 
   the best efficiency will be achieved by transmitting that data
   reliably (the external appearance of a simulated vehicle is an 
   excellent example). They also require real-time transmission of a
   best-effort stream (for example the position and orientation of the
   vehicle). There is no value to reliable transmission of this stream
   because typically new updates arrive faster than loss identification
   and retransmission could take place. By piggy-backing the sequence 
   number (SN) of the latest reliable transmission on each bundle of 
   traffic, the reliable and best-effort traffic can co-exist 
   synergistically.

2. Protocol Description

   The Selectively Reliable Multicast Protocol (SRMP) has two major
   components: Selectively Reliable Transport (SRT) and a "bundling
   sublayer" that implements TCP-Friendly Multicast Congestion 
   Control (TFMCC), as proposed by Widmer and Handley [3], in order 
   to meet the requirements of RFC3269 [2] for congestion avoidance.

   SRMP is capable of reliable message delivery over multicast 
   networks, when the messages to be delivered reliably represent a 
   fraction of a larger, associated best-effort flow and only the 
   latest reliable message must be delivered. The basic strategy 
   of SRMP is trade as little network capacity as possible for 
   reliability by buffering the latest sent reliable message at each 
   sender and piggybacking its sequence number on associated best-
   effort messages. For this purpose, three modes of sending are 
   defined: 

   o   Mode 0 messages.  These will be delivered best-effort; 
       if lost, no retransmission will be done. 

   o   Mode 1 messages. When a Mode 1 message loss is detected, the 
       receiver will send back a NACK to the sender, where SRMP will 
       retransmit the latest reliable message from that sender. 
       Senders define data identifiers (DataIDs), allowing multiple 
       reliable message streams to be supported. Mode 1 messages may be
       up to 131,071 bytes long; SRMP provides for segmentation and 
       reassembly, but only for the latest Mode 1 message for any given
       <sourceAddress, multicastAddress, DataID>. 

   o   Mode 2 messages. Through Mode 2 messages, SRMP provides for a 
       lightweight, reliable, connectionless peer-to-peer unicast 
       transaction exchange between any two members of the multicast 
       group. This is a unicast message requiring positive 
       acknowledgement (ACK).

       | Application   |
       -----------------       ----------
       |      SRT      |
       -----------------   ->     SRMP
       |Bundling(TFMCC)|
       -----------------       ----------
       |      UDP      |

   The Bundling sublayer is transparent to the Selectively Reliable 
   Transport (SRT) sublayer. It implements congestion control both by 
   dropping Mode 0 messages at the source when needed, and also by 
   bundling multiple short messages that are presented by applications 
   within a short time window. It also performs NACK suppression.

   A bundling sublayer data unit is called a bundle. A bundle is made 
   up of a bundle header and any of Mode 0 and 1 SRMP messages. 
   Retransmission of Mode 1 messages does not imply retransmission of 
   the original bundle; the retransmitted message becomes part of a 
   new bundle.

   The TFMCC layer's behavior follows the mechanism described by
   Widmer and Handley. This is an equation-based multicast congestion 
   control mechanism: in a multicast group, each receiver determines

   its loss rate with regard to the sender, and calculates a desired 
   source sending rate based on an equation that provides that models 
   the steady-state sending rate of TCP. A distributed feedback 
   suppression mechanism restricts feedback to those receivers likely 
   to report the lowest desired rates. Congestion control is achieved 
   by dropping best-effort (Mode 0) messages at random. For example, 
   in distributed simulation Mode 0 messages are part of a stream of 
   state update for dynamic data such as geographic location; therefore 
   the application can continue to function (with lower fidelity) when 
   they are dropped.

   As described by its authors, TFMCC's congestion control mechanism 
   works as follows:
   o Each receiver measures the loss event rate and its RTT to the 
     sender.
   o Each receiver then uses this information, together with an 
     equation for TCP throughput, to derive a TCP-friendly sending 
     rate.
   o Through a distributed feedback suppression mechanism, only a 
     subset of the receivers are allowed to give feedback to prevent 
     a feedback implosion at the sender.  The feedback mechanism 
     ensures that receivers reporting a low desired transmission rate 
     have a high probability of sending feedback.
   o Receivers whose feedback is not suppressed report the calculated
     transmission rate back to the sender in so-called receiver 
     reports. The receiver reports serve two purposes: they inform the 
     sender about the appropriate transmit rate, and they allow the 
     receivers to measure their RTT.
   o The sender selects the receiver that reports the lowest rate as
     current limiting receiver (CLR).  Whenever feedback with an even 
     lower rate reaches the sender, the corresponding receiver becomes 
     CLR and the sending rate is reduced to match that receiver's 
     calculated rate. The sending rate increases when the CLR reports 
     a calculated rate higher than the current sending rate.
   TFMCC was intended for fixed-size packets with variable rate. SRMP
   applies it to variable-size SRMP messages that are mostly the same
   size because the best-effort updates typically all represent the
   same sort of simulation information.

   A bundle is an aggregation of multiple SRMP messages fo the same
   multicast address. A bundle can contain only Mode 0 and Mode 1 
   messages; Mode 2 messages are exchanged using unicast addresses.

4 TFMCC Operation

4.1 TCP rate prediction equation

   The recommended throughput equation for SRMP is a slightly simplified 
   version of the throughput equation for Reno TCP from [4]:
                                     8 s
     X = ------------------------------------------------------   (1)
           R * (sqrt(2*p/3) + (3*sqrt(6*p) * p * (1+32*p^2)))

   where

      X is the transmit rate in bits/second.

      s is the message size in bytes.

      R is the round-trip time in seconds.

      p is the loss event rate, between 0.0 and 1.0, of the number of
        loss events as a fraction of the number of messages transmitted.

   In the future, different TCP formulas may be substituted for this 
   equation. The requirement is that the throughput equation be a 
   reasonable approximation of the sending rate of TCP for conformant 
   TCP congestion control.

4.2 Bundling

   Multiple SRMP messages will be encapsulated into a bundle. When a 
   new SRMP message (mode 0 or mode 1) arrives, the SRMP daemon will 
   try to add the new message into the current bundle. 

   The SRMP daemon should keep a timer, which will be reset when the 
   first SRMP message is added into the bundle. After Bundle_Timeout, 
   the timer will time out, and the current bundle should be 
   transmitted immediately. A new bundle will then be initialized to
   hold new SRMP messages. Bundle_Timeout shall not be less than 1 ms.
   Recommended value is 10 ms.

   Also, the bundle length must not exceed LENGTH_MAX. If adding a new
   SRMP message will produce a greater length, the SRMP daemon must
   initialize a new bundle for the new SRMP messages, and the current
   bundle should be transmitted immediately. Recommended value for 
   LENGTH_MAX is 1454 bytes (Ethernet MTU minus IP and UDP header 
   lengths).

   In a bundle, there may exist multiple SRMP messages with the same 
   DataID. In this case, only the latest version of that DataID is 
   useful. SRMP may check for duplicate DataIDs in the same bundle 
   and delete all but the latest one.

Internet Draft            draft-pullen-srmp-02.txt            March 2003


   The bundle header contains the DSN <DataID,SN,NoSegs> for Mode 1 
   messages from this sender. The absolute maximum number of DSN is 
   255, however an implementation may apply a user-specified DSN_Max, 
   no smaller than 1. An implementation may support a user-defined      
   DataID_Timeout, after which a given DataID will not be announced 
   in the bundle header unless a new Mode 1 message has been sent. If 
   the sender has more DataIDs sent (and not timed out) than will fit 
   in the bundle header, the DSNs must be announced on a round-robin 
   basis, with the exception that no bundle header will announce a 
   DSN for a Mode 1 message contained within that bundle.

4.3 Congestion Control

   The congestion control mechanism operates as described in [3].

4.4 Any-Source Multicast

   SRMP uses Any-Source Multicast Mode. Each sender will determine its
   Maximum RTT, Suppression data rate and Sending rate with respect to
   each sender. Each receiver will measure its RTT and Desired Rate to
   each sender in the group, and send feedback to every sender by
   sending to the multicast group.
  
4.5 Multiple Sources

   Under SRMP, each group member in a multicast group is a sender as
   well as receiver. Each receiver may need to participate in TFMCC
   information exchange with all senders. Thus, when a receiver sends 
   a feedback message, it must identify to which source the message 
   should be sent using the "Sender ID" field in the header.

Pullen                    Expires: September 2003            [Page 13]

Internet Draft            draft-pullen-srmp-02.txt            March 2003


   The feedback is multicast to the group. Depending on the network
   situation, senders may select different receivers to provide feedback.
   Feedback messages from receivers that are not among those selected by 
   the local TFMCC to provide feedback should be silently discarded.

4.6. Bundle Size

   TFMCC is designed for traffic with fixed message size. The maximum
   bundle size (including header) for SRMP is set to a configurable
   maximum, typically 1454 bytes (Ethernet MTU less IP and UDP header 
   length). The bundle size will be used in a TCP throughput equation, 
   to get a desired source rate. However, in SRMP the message size is 
   variable because:

   1. After bundle time out, the current bundle will not wait for new
      SRMP messages. This will happen with sources sending at a slow rate.

Pullen                    Expires: September 2003            [Page 14]

Internet Draft            draft-pullen-srmp-02.txt            March 2003


   2. Long messages; there is no further space in the current bundle for 
      new SRMP messages. This will happen with sources sending at a high 
      rate or sending messages with length over half of the bundle payload
      size.

   The case 1 bundle size is likely to be much smaller than that of 
   case 2. 

   Therefore in SRMP the mean value of the 10 most recent bundles' sizes 
   will be used as the bundle size in the TCP throughput equation.
   This mean value is independent from the network condition and 
   reflects current activity of the source.

4.7 Data rate control

   Each host will have a single instance of SRMP supporting all of its
   applications. Thus the sender's source rate is the sum of the rates
   all clients of the same multicast group.

   If the source rate is larger than the senders desired transmission
   rate, it is the sender's responsibility to do traffic shaping. Any
   method that conforms to the target sending rate may be used. The
   recommended method is to randomly discard enough Mode 0 messages to
   meet the target rate.

4.8. Mode 1 loss detection

   Bundle header processing includes checking each DSN in the bundle
   header and scheduling a NACK for each DSN bearing a DataID for which
   some application has indicated interest, if the SN/SegNo in that DSN
   indicates a NACK is needed. NACKs are sent in bundles, and may be 
   bundled with data messages. A NACK is required if:

   o   the SN is one or more greater (mod 512) than the latest received
       Mode 1 message for that DataID, or

   o   the SegNo has not been received, some segment of the <DataID,SN>
       has been received, and a user-defined Segment_Timeout, which
       shall not be less than 50 ms, has expired since receipt of the
       first SegNo for the <DataID,SN>.

   The bundling sublayer will pass the DSN list in any received bundle
   header to the SRT sublayer. It also will suppress NACKs in outgoing 
   bundles, as described in the next section.

4.8.1 Sending a Negative Acknowledgement

   Negative acknowledgements are used by SRMP for multicast messages in
   order to avoid the congestion of an "ACK implosion" at the original
   sender that would likely occur if positive acknowledgements were 
   used instead. However, with a large multicast group spread out over

Pullen                    Expires: September 2003            [Page 15]

Internet Draft            draft-pullen-srmp-02.txt            March 2003


   a congested wide-area network, there is the potential for enough
   members of the multicast group to fail to receive the message and 
   generate NACKs to cause considerable congestion at the original 
   sender despite the use of negative acknowledgements instead of 
   positive acknowledgements. For this reason, SRMP uses a NACK
   suppression mechanism to reduce the number of NACKs generated in
   response to any single lost message.

   The NACK suppression mechanism uses the Bundle_Timeout to distribute
   NACKs over an appropriate time window. This assumes that the user has
   Selected a bundle timeout appropriate to the needs of the 
   application for real-time responsiveness.

   When the bundling sublayer is ready to send a bundle, it removes 
   from the bundle any NACKs for which a response has been sent by 
   another member of the multicast group within the NACK_Repeat_Timeout
   window. If the original Bundle_Timeout has not expired, transmission
   of the bundle may then be delayed until the original Bundle_Timeout
   expires or the bundle is full, whichever happens first.
 
4.9 Unbundling

   After a receiver completes congestion control processing on a 
   bundle, it parses the bundle into SRT messages and sends these to 
   SRT sublayer.

4.10 Heartbeat bundle

   SRMP implementations may support a user-defined Heartbeat_Interval,
   Which shall not be less than one second. At the end of each heartbeat
   interval, if the sender has not sent any bundle, an empty bundle will
   be sent in order to trigger Mode 1 loss detection.


5. SRT Operation

   SRMP operates in three distinct transmission modes in order to
   deliver varying levels of reliability: Mode 0 for multicast data 
   that does not require reliable transmission, Mode 1 for data that
   must be received reliably by all members of a multicast group, and
   Mode 2 for data that must be received reliably by a single 
   dynamically-determined member of a multicast group.

   Mode 0 operates as a pure best-effort service. Mode 1 operates
   with negative acknowledgements only, triggered by bundle arrivals
   that indicate loss of a Mode 1 message. Mode 2 uses a positive 
   acknowledgement for each message to provide reliability and low 
   latency. Mode 2 is used where a transaction between two members of a
   multicast group is needed. Because there can be many members in such
   a group, use of a transaction protocol, with reliability achieved by


Pullen                    Expires: September 2003            [Page 16]

Internet Draft            draft-pullen-srmp-02.txt            March 2003


   SRMP retransmission, avoids the potentially large amount of 
   connection setup and associated state that would be required if each
   pair of hosts in the group established a separate TCP connection.

   Use of SRMP anticipates that only a small fraction of messages will
   require reliable multicast, and a comparably small fraction will 
   require reliable unicast. This is due to a property of distributed
   virtual simulation: the preponderance of messages consist of state
   update streams for object attributes such as position and 
   orientation. SRMP is unlikely to provide effective reliable 
   multicast if the traffic does not have this property.
   
   In SRMP, "DataID" is used to associate related messages with each 
   other. Typically, all messages with the same DataID are associated
   with the same application entity. All the messages with the same
   "DataID" must be transmitted in the same Mode. Among all the 
   messages with the same Dataid, the latest version  will obsolete all
   older messages.

5.1 Mode 0 operation

   Mode 0 is for multicast messages that do not require reliable 
   transmission because they are part of a real-time stream of data 
   that is periodically updated with high frequency. Any such message
   is very likely to have been superceded by a more recent update 
   before retransmission could be completed.

5.1.1 Sending Mode 0 messages

   When an application requests transmission of Mode 0 data, a
   destination multicast group must be provided to SRMP along 
   with the data to be sent. After verifying the data length and
   multicast group, the following steps must be performed by the SRT
   sublayer:

   1.   An SRMP message must be generated with the following 
        characteristics: 

        the version is set to the current version, the message type is
        set to 0x0, the Mode is set to 0x0. User data is included after
        the message header. If the message cannot be generated as 
        described above, the user data is discarded and the error must
        be reported to the application.

   2.   If step 1 was completed without error, the newly generated 
        message must be sent to the bundling sublayer The 
        implementation must report to the application whether or not
        the message was ultimately accepted by UDP.

5.1.2. Receiving Mode 0 Messages

   When a mode 0 message is received by SRMP it must be processed as
   follows, after verifying the version, message type, and destination
   multicast address fields, the user data must be delivered to all
   applications that are associated with the multicast group in the 
   message. If the SRMP receiver has never received any Mode 1 messages 
   before the mode 0 message received, the mode 0 message should be 
   silently discarded.

It is recommended that the following information should be provided to the receiving applications: message body, multicast address. 


5.2. Mode 1 operation

   Mode 1 is for multicast data that requires reliable transmission. A
   Mode 1 message can be either a data message or a NACK. Mode 1 data
   messages are expected to be part of a data stream. This data stream
   is likely to contain Mode 0 messages as well (see section 3.1.1), 
   but it is possible for a data stream to be comprised solely of Mode
   1 messages. 

5.2.1. Sending Mode 1 Data messages

   After the data length, dataID, and destination multicast group are
   verified, SRT must take the following steps:

   1.   If the message will not fit in an empty bundle with DSN_Max DSN
        in the header, the message must be segmented. The remaining
        steps pertain to each segment of the message. Each segment 
        receives a unique SegNo, starting with 0 and ending with
        (NoSegs-1).

   2.   An SRT message is generated with the following characteristics:
        the Version is set to 0x02, the message type is set to 0x0, the
        transmission Mode is set to 0x1, The SN is set equal to the SN
        of the most recently sent Mode 1 complete message of the same
        DataID, incremented by 1 modulo 512. If no such mode 1 message
        exists, the SN is set to 0x0.

   3.   The newly generated message (all segments) must then be 
        buffered, replacing any formerly buffered Mode 1 message of the
        same DataID, destination multicast address. If the message
        cannot be buffered, the user data is discarded and the error is
        reported to the application.

   4.   If step 2 was completed without error, the newly generated 
        message is sent to the TFMCC sublayer.

Internet Draft            draft-pullen-srmp-02.txt            March 2003


5.2.2. Receiving Mode 1 Data messages

   When a Mode 1 data message is received by SRT it will be processed
   as follows (assuming that the version field has already been 
   verified to be 0x02):

   1.   The destination address must be verified to be a valid IP 
        multicast address on which this instance of SRMP is a member. 
        If this is not the case, the message should be silently
        discarded.

   2.   The destination address must be verified to be one for which some 
        application has indicated interest. If no application wants the
        destination address, the message should be silently discarded.  

   3.   The SN,SegNo, source_ip_address, and the body of the received 
        message must be buffered, and the user data must then be delivered 
        to all applications that have indicated interest in the multicast
        group of the received message.

   4.   When a new DSN value is received with NoSegs greater than zero,
        a timer should be set for Segment_Timeout, after which a NACK 
        should be sent to the bundling sublayer and the timer should be
        restarted for Segment_Timeout.

   5.   If NoSegs in the received message is not 0, a reassembly 
        process must be started. Each segment must be buffered. If 
        receipt of the current message completes the segment, the 
        reassembled message must be released to the application and the
        Segment_Timeout timer cancelled.

   6.   If a new DSN is received before all segments of the previous 
        DSN are received, the segments that have been received should
        be dropped silently.

   7.   It is recommended that the following information should be 
        provided to the receiving applications: message body, dataid, 
        source_ip_address, multicast_group address.

   8.   When a client signs on to a new multicast group, all locally 
        buffered mode 1 messages related to that multicast group should 
        be delivered to the client immediately.


5.2.3 Scheduling a Negative Acknowledgement

   Whenever a bundle is received, the bundling sublayer will forward
   the DSN list from the bundle header to the SRT sublayer. The SRT 
   sublayer will examine buffered values of <SenderID,DataID,SN,Segno>
   to determine whether a NACK is required. If so, it will generate a
   NACK message and send it to the bundling sublayer. The NACK message 

Pullen                    Expires: September 2003            [Page 19]

Internet Draft            draft-pullen-srmp-02.txt            March 2003


   will have version set to 0x2, message type set to 0x1, transmission
   mode set to 0x1. DataID, SN, and destination address are set to that
   of the Mode 1 message for which the NACK is being sent. If a NACK has
   been received from any member of the destination multicast group for
   the Mode 1 message in question within the NACK threshold, no NACK is
   generated.

   For segmented messages, there are two possible types of NACKs:

   o   Based on the DSN list in the bundle header, the SRT implementation
       may determine that an entire segmented Mode 1 message was lost. 
       In this case the NACK must carry Segno=0x127 (all one in field).

   o   Based on Segment Timeout, the SRT implementation may determine 
       that one or more segments of a message have not been delivered. 
       In this case, a NACK will be sent for each missing segment.

5.2.4 Receiving a Negative Acknowledgement

   When a NACK is received by SRT, it must be processed as follows, after
   verifying the multicast address, DataID, source IP address, and 
   transmission mode:

   1.   If this instance of SRT's most recent Mode 1 message of the
        DataID indicated in the NACK has a SN newer than SN in the NACK,
        that message (which is buffered) should be immediately 
        retransmitted to the multicast address indicated in the 
        received NACK. If the most recent Mode 1 message has a SN 
        equal to the SN indicated in the NACK, and if the SegNo field 
        in the NACK contains 0x127, all segments of the buffered Mode 1 
        message must be retransmitted; if the SegNo has some other 
        value, only the indicated segment should be retransmitted.

   2.   Whether or not step 1 results in the retransmission of a 
        message, the event of receiving the NACK and the (local machine)
        time at which the NACK was received should be buffered. Each
        instance of SRT must buffer the number of NACKs that have been 
        received for each DataID - multicast address pair, since the 
        most recent Mode 1 message of the same pair was received and 
        the time at which the most recent of these NACKs was received.

5.3. Mode 2 Operation

   Mode 2 is for infrequent reliable transaction-oriented communication
   between two dynamically determined members of a multicast group. TCP
   could be used for such communication, but there would be unnecessary
   overhead and delay in establishing a stream-oriented connection for
   a single exchange of data, whereas there is already an ongoing 
   stream of best-effort data between the hosts that require Mode 2 
   transmission. An example is a Distributed Interactive Simulation 
   (DIS) collision PDU.

5.3.1 Sending Mode 2 Data messages

   When an application requests transmission of Mode 2 data, a
   DataID and a destination unicast IP address must be provided to SRT
   along with the data to be sent. After verifying the data length, 
   DataID and destination address, SRT must perform the following 
   steps:

   1.   An SRT message is generated with the following characteristics:
        the version is set to 0x02, the message type is set to 0x0, the
        transmission mode is set to 0x2, the DataID is set to the 
        application-provided value, and the destination address is set
        to the application-provided IP address. The SN is set equal to
        the SN of the most recently sent Mode 2 message of the same 
        DataID incremented by 1 modulo 65536. If no such Mode 1 message
        exists, it is set to 0x0.

   2.   The newly generated message is buffered. This new message does
        not replace any formerly buffered Mode 2 messages. An
        implementation must provide a Mode 2 message buffer that can 
        hold one or more Mode 2 messages. Mode 2 messages are expected
        to be infrequent (less than 1% percent of total traffic), but
        it is still strongly recommended that an implementation provide
        a buffer of user-configurable size Mode2_Max that can hold more
        than a single Mode 2 message. If the message cannot be 
        buffered, the user data is discarded and the error must be
        reported to the application. 

   3.   If step 2 was completed without error, the newly generated
        message must be sent to the IP address contained in its
        destination address field, encapsulated within a UDP datagram.
        If the UDP interface on the sending system reports an error to
        SRT when the attempt to send the SRT message is made, an 
        implementation may attempt to resend the message any finite
        number of times. However, every implementation must provide a
        mode in which no retries are attempted. Implementations should
        default to this latter mode of operation. The implementation 
        must report to the application whether or not the message was
        ultimately accepted by UDP.

   4.   If some user-configurable "ACK_Threshold" (which should be
        greater than the worst-case round-trip time for the multicast
        group) elapses without receipt of an ACK for the Mode 2 
        message, it is retransmitted. An implementation may define a
        maximum number of retransmissions to be attempted before the
        Mode 2 message is removed from the buffer.

5.3.2 Receiving Mode 2 Data messages

   When a Mode 2 data message is received by SRT it should be processed
   as follows after verifying Version, DataID, sender address, and SN:

 1.   For Mode 2 messages, the sequence number field is used to 
        associate the required positive acknowledgement with a specific
        Mode 2 message. If the message passes verification, the 
        encapsulated user data is delivered to all applications that
        have indicated interest in the DataID and multicast address of
        the received message, regardless of the value of the SN field.

   2.   Additionally, an ACK must be sent to the host from which the
        Mode 2 data message originated. See section 3.3.3. below for
        details.

5.3.3 Sending a Positive Acknowledgement

   A positive acknowledgement (ACK) is triggered by the receipt of a
   Mode 2 data message. To send an ACK, a new SRT message is generated
   with version set to 0x02, message type set to 0x2, and transmission
   mode set to 0x2. DataID and SN are those of the Mode 2 data message
   being acknowledged. The destination address field is set to the
   source IP address from which the data message was received. Since
   Mode 2 data messages are unicast there is little concern about an 
   ACK implosion causing excessive congestion at the original sender,
   so no suppression mechanism is necessary.

5.3.4 Receiving a Positive Acknowledgement

   When an ACK is received by SRT, after verifying the transmission 
   mode, DataID, and source IP address against outstanding Mode 2 
   transmission SRT must remove the pending transmission from its 
   buffer.


6. IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA actions required for this document.


7. Security Considerations

   As a transport protocol, SRMP is subject to denial of service by
   hostile third parties sending conflicting values of its parameters
   on the multicast address. SRMP does not attempt to protect itself
   from this sort of behavior, however it can be shielded from such
   attacks by IPSEC traffic authentication as specified in RFC 2402.
