Internet-Draft           The 'qname:' URI Scheme              March 2002


1. Overview

   The 'qname:' URI scheme is intended to provide a simple but
   consistent means by which XML Namespace qualified names [1] may be
   represented for the sake of communication between web applications.

   The 'qname:' URI scheme provides for the distinction between
   elements, global attributes, and per-element attributes to be made
   fully explicit; thus preserving contextual information about the
   occurrence of the name within a given XML instance which may be
   significant to its interpretation.

   Examples:

      qname:(voc://nokia.com/MARS-2.2/)title
      qname:(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml%23)title
      qname:(http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/)title
      qname:(http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema%23)date
      qname:(http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema%23)label
      qname:(http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema%23)@about
      qname:(urn:pubcom:books-r-us/catalog)author@name
      qname:(urn:pubcom:books-r-us/catalog)publication@name
      qname:(mailto:jane.doe@booga.com)widget
      qname:(uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6)e28b11f

   These examples are provided for illustrative purposes only and do not
   necessarily constitute actual URIs.  See the BNF definition below for
   an explicit definition of 'qname:' URI syntax.

2. BNF for the 'qname:' URI Scheme

   This is a BNF-like description of the 'qname:' Uniform Resource
   Identifier syntax, using the conventions of RFC 822[2], except that
   "|" is used to designate alternatives, and brackets [] are used
   around optional or repeated elements.  Briefly, literals are quoted
   with "", optional elements are enclosed in [brackets], and elements
   may be preceded with <n>* to designate n or more repetitions of the
   following element; n defaults to 0.

   This BNF description adopts sub-definitions defined in RFC 2396
   "Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax" [3] and the W3C
   Recommendation REC-xml-names "Namespaces in XML" [1] which are not
   repeated here.

   val-URI       = "qname:" "(" namespace ")" name
   namespace      = absoluteURI [ "%23" fragment ]
   name           = element | globalAttr | perElementAttr
   element        = NCName
   attribute      = NCName
   globalAttr     = "@" attribute
   perElementAttr = element "@" attribute

   NCName         = <as defined by W3C REC-xml-names>
   absoluteURI    = <as defined by RFC 2396>
   fragment       = <as defined by RFC 2396>


   Any occurrences of the characters '(', ')', or '%' in either the
   absoluteURI or fragment segments must be URI escaped.  E.g.  the
   namespace URI "foo:abc(xyz)#def%23bar" with local name "zzz" would be
   encoded as "qname:(foo:abc%28xyx%29%23def%2523bar)zzz".

   Note that the URI scheme prefix "qname:" is considered to be a valid
   URI denoting this URI scheme, though it is not itself a valid URI
   according to this URI scheme.

3. Security Considerations

   This document raises no known security issues.

4. Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Sean Palmer (sean@mysterylights.com) for his insightful
   comments and suggestions regarding earlier formulations of this URI
   scheme and for suggesting the preservation of contextual information
   differentiating elements, global attributes, and per-element
   attributes.
