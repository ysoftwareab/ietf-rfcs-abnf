 0. Abstract

    RFC1265 [RFC1265], "BGP protocol Analysis" documents how the
    requirements for advancing a routing protocol to Draft
    Standard have been satisfied by a BGP-3, a technology which
    is no longer commonly used. This document requests that RFC
    1265 be moved to historic status.   
 
 1. Details
 
    During a review of internet standards relating to BGP, it
    became apparent that the BGP-3 Protocol Analysis, as
    described in RFC1265, is not common usage (if at all). Since
    this protocol has not been in use in the public internet for
    many years (it is obsoleted by BGP-4 [RFC1771]), it is
    proposed to reclassify it to historic.

 2. Security Considerations
 
    Moving RFC1265 to historic has no known effect on the security of the
    internet.
