1.  Introduction

   It has been discovered that certain BGP Path Attribute values have
   been used in BGP implementations which have been deployed in the wild
   while not being assigned by the IANA for such usage.  This has led to
   deployment problems for new technologies such as Large BGP
   Communities [I-D.ietf-idr-large-community].

   The squatting of values 30, 31, 129, 241, 242 and 243 has been
   confirmed by the involved vendors or through source code review.

2.  IANA Considerations

   Per this document, IANA is requested to mark values 30, 31, 129, 241,
   242, and 243 as "deprecated" in the "BGP Path Attributes" registry
   under the "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Parameters" group.  The
   marking "deprecated" meaning "use is not recommended"
   ([I-D.leiba-cotton-iana-5226bis]).

3.  Security Considerations

   There are no meaningful security consequences arising from this
   registry update.
