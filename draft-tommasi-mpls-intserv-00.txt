Abstract 
   The Integrated Services (IntServ) architecture [RFC1633] defines QoS 
   services and reservation parameters to be used to obtain for an 
   Internet flow the required QoS. After a reservation has been 
   established using the RSVP protocol [RFC2205], a router classifies 
   each incoming IP packet to determine whether it belongs to a QoS 
   flow.  
    
   The MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) allows high-performing label 
   switching of packets [RFC3031]. Network traffic is forwarded using a 
   simple label. The CR-LDP protocol allows the definition of a Label 
   Switched Path (LSP) with QoS constraints [CR-LDP], that is to perform 
   QoS classification using a single valued label.

   This draft efficiently combines the application-oriented IntServ QoS 
   with the power of MPLS label switching, that is it defines IntServ-
   like QoS services in MPLS domains. Using the mechanisms defined in 
   this draft, a homogeneous end-to-end QoS is reached.

draft-tommasi-mpls-intserv-00.txt                           March 2001 

1. Introduction 

   The Integrated Services (IntServ) architecture [RFC1633] defines QoS 
   services and reservation parameters to be used to obtain for an 
   Internet flow the required QoS. RSVP [RFC2205] is the signaling 
   protocol used to convey these parameters from one or multiple senders 
   towards a unicast or multicast destination. 
    
   RSVP assigns QoS with the granularity of single application's flows. 
   An heavy signaling traffic is then exchanged between routers 
   belonging to a core area of the Internet, as they must serve an high 
   number of flows and their reservation requests. Moreover, after a 
   reservation has been established, each router must classify each 
   incoming IP packet to determine whether it belongs to a QoS flow or 
   not and, in the former case, to assign the needed resources to the 
   flow. The IntServ classifier is a based on a MultiField 
   classification, because it checks five parameters in each IP packet 
   (Source IP address, Destination IP address, Protocol ID, Source 
   transport port, Destination transport port). 
    
   Hence, together with the publication of the basic RSVP documents, an 
   informational document [RFC2208] bewares potential users of RSVP of 
   the scalability issues posed by signaling, classification and 
   scheduling mechanisms.  
   An important consequence of this problem is that IntServ-level QoS 
   can be provided only within peripheral areas of the Internet, 
   preventing its extension inside core areas and the implementation of 
   end-to-end QoS. 
    
   Some work has been devoted to overcome these problems. The RSVP WG is 
   publishing an RFC that describes a set of techniques [ROREXT] that 
   reduce the overhead of RSVP signaling but don't even deal with the 
   classification problem, which still remains unfaced.  
    
   Another draft [RAGGR] of the ISSLL WG discusses the possibility of 
   aggregation of RSVP sessions into a larger one, signaling a DiffServ 
   DSCP to be used for this aggregated traffic. This solution wastes the 
   undoubted benefits given by the granularity of IntServ reservations. 
    
   The MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) protocol allows high-
   performing label switching of packets [RFC3031]. Network traffic is 
   forwarded using a simple label. The CR-LDP protocol allows the 
   definition of a Label Switched Path (LSP) with QoS constraints [CR-
   LDP], that is to perform QoS classification using a single valued 
   label (not a MultiField one).

draft-tommasi-mpls-intserv-00.txt                           March 2001 

   The main limitation of this approach is that currently it can't be 
   used by end-hosts because they can't do CR-LDP signaling. On the 
   other side IntServ has been designed to allow application to signal 
   QoS requirements on their own; Reservation APIs are available and 
   many operating systems allow applications to use them. 
    
   The basic idea of this draft is to combine the application-oriented 
   IntServ QoS with the power of MPLS label switching, that is to define 
   IntServ-like QoS services in MPLS domains. Using the mechanisms 
   defined in this draft, a homogeneous end-to-end QoS can be reached. 
    
   At the same time, the number and the effects of the changes to the 
   current CR-LDP specifications are minimal. The most part of the 
   integration work is bounded into the Ingress LSR at the sender side 
   of the MPLS domain's border. 
    
2. Integration of RSVP and CR-LDP signaling   
    
   Let us consider two RSVP applications exchanging RSVP messages along 
   a path that crosses an MPLS domain.  
    
    
      Path   Path      |   (Path)   (Path)   |      Path   Path 
                       |                     |
      --->   --->      |    --->     --->    |      --->   ---> 
                       |                     | 
   HS --- R1 --- IngressLSR --- LSR  --- EgressLSR  --- R2 --- HR 
                       |                     |

                       |                     | 
                       |                     | 
                       |                     |

   Figure 1 - A simple topology 
    
    
   An LSR (Label Switching Router) is not an RSVP router. By the RSVP 
   point of view, the whole MPLS domain is a non-RSVP region, crossed by 
   RSVP end-to-end messages. As such, all RSVP basic messages (Path/Resv 
   too) travel within MPLS as ordinary IP traffic without being 
   intercepted by the LSRs. RSVP cannot then reserve network resources. 
    
   One of the LSRs internal to the domain may happen to have an RSVP 
   process. To the purposes of this document, it is important to avoid

   this router processes RSVP messages. Both the Ingress and Egress LSR 
   modifies then the IP Protocol Number of all RSVP messages directed 
   towards the MPLS domains form the RSVP value to the RSVP-E2E-IGNORE. 
    
   The meaning and the usage of the latter value are discussed in 
   [RAGGR]: all these messages are ignored by the LSR inside the domain. 
   The Egress LSR that receives an RSVP message directed outside the 
   domain with the Protocol field set to RSVP-E2E-IGNORE, swap this 
   value back to RSVP. 
    
   Using the mechanisms proposed in this draft, the MPLS domain may 
   participate, using its native CR-LDP messages, to the realization of 
   a level of service inside the domain comparable with the IntServ QoS 
   requested by RSVP applications.  
    
   This section covers the rules to generate proper CR-LDP messages. 
    
   After the receipt of an RSVP message which reserves resources, the 
   Ingress LSR establishes a CR-LSP (Constraint Routed LSP) towards the 
   Egress LSRs. This CR-LSP is endowed with the QoS specified by the 
   FLOWSPEC object carried by the Resv message. The RSVP sender's 
   traffic crosses the MPLS domain using this CR-LSP. 
    
   The Ingress LSR is the responsible to perform the message translation 
   to create this CR-LSP. LSRs not on the edge of the MPLS domains will 
   only process CR-LDP messages. 
    
   In the following we will refer, for a given RSVP flow, to the last 
   RSVP router upstream to the MPLS domain as an Edge PHop and to the 
   first RSVP router downstream to the MPLS domain as an Edge NHop.  
   In the topology of the Figure 1 the Edge PHop coincides with the 
   Ingress LSR and the Edge NHop coincides with the Egress LSR. 
   The CR-LSP is defined between the Ingress LSR and the Egress LSR. 
    
   CR-LDP does not provide the signaling of multicast LSPs. Hence in 
   this draft is not considered, at the moment, the possibility to 
   reserve QoS inside the MPLS domain using RSVP multicast messages. 
    
    
    
2.1 Path Messages 
    
   RSVP is a receiver-oriented protocol. Before the receiver is enabled 
   to transmit the reservation request the sender must send to it a Path 
   message.

   A Path message does two main tasks.  
   The first one is to trace the proper path from the sender towards the 
   receiver. This path will be followed by the reserving Resv message 
   traveling in the opposite direction. Inside the MPLS domain the route 
   followed by the Path message is not important. The packets of the 
   flow will use the CR-LSP to be created - perhaps on a path different 
   from that followed by the Path message. 
    
   The second one is to advertise the receiving application of the 
   IntServ traffic parameters that characterize the flow (SENDER_TSPEC 
   object) and the network elements on the path (ADSEPC object). The 
   MPLS domain doesn't care the SENDER_TSPEC because this information 
   has an end-to-end scope. The ADSPEC object is generated by the sender 
   and updated along the Path instead. It would useful that the LSRs 
   could cooperate to the collection of these parameters. 
    
   According to this version of this document, the MPLS ignores Path 
   messages and the Ingress LSR simply forwards them as regular IP 
   traffic towards their destination.  
    
   The same can be told for Path messages that change existing state in 
   Ingress LSRs. In the case that a Path message of a given session 
   enters the domain through a different Ingress LSR, the Ingress LSR 
   ignores this new message - as well as the old one. The associated 
   Resv message will create new RSVP state into the new Ingress LSR and 
   the old Ingress LSR will delete old RSVP state (perhaps via a time-
   out.) 
    
2.2 Resv Messages 
    
   After having received the Path message an application may send a Resv 
   message. This message tracks the RSVP routers traversed by the Path 
   message (in the opposite direction) and reserves resources on them. 
    
   The Resv message will reach the Egress LSR, which is also the last 
   RSVP node after the MPLS domain. After this node, the message will 
   travel inside the MPLS domain. The Resv message will reach the 
   Ingress LSR through the MPLS domain.  The Ingress LSR transmits the 
   Resv message upstream towards its interface over the IntServ area.  
    
2.3 Setup of the CR-LSP 
    
   Soon after having forwarded the Resv message the Ingress LSR sets up 
   the CR-LSP. The Ingress node sends a Label Request message with an 
   ER-TLV object directed towards the Egress LSR.

   Figure 2 - Messages exchange 
    
   The ER-TLV object has an ER-Hop TLV whose Content field is the IP 
   address of the Egress LSR taken from the NHOP object of the Resv 
   Message. This object has a ER-Hop-Type field set to the "IPv4 prefix" 
   type if this address is an IPv4 one, or to the "IPv6 prefix" type if 
   this address is an IPv6 one. The L flag is set to allow the setup of 
   a Loose Explicit Route.  
    
   It is not important what route the Label Request message uses to 
   reach the Egress LSR (the RSVP NHop). The only constraint is that the 
   last ER-Hop TLV MUST be the RSVP NHOP. If an implementation wants to 
   add more ER-Hops (that is to do Traffic Engineering) is free to do 
   it. The same can be told for all the other optional TLV objects of 
   the message. 
    
   The Traffic Parameters TLV is mandatory as far as this specifications 
   and its fields are set to specify a QoS level equivalent to that 
   specified in the FLOWSPEC object of the Resv message. More on mapping 
   mechanisms in Section 3. 
    
   If no errors are found while forwarding the Label Request message, 
   the Egress LSR forwards to the Ingress LSR a Label Mapping message 
   that creates the CR-LSP. 
    
   During the usage of the CR-LSP, if a new Resv message updates some of 
   the traffic parameters in the FLOWSPEC object, the Ingress assigns to 
   the flow enough resources to fit this request. The old CR-LSP should 
   be released via a Label release message and a new one, with the 
   changed Traffic Parameters TLV must be setup. An alternative

   technique may use the [LSPMOD] draft, which allows the modification 
   of CR-LSPs without service interruption or disruption. 
    
   If the NHop address in a Resv message changes, that is a new Egress 
   LSR is selected, the CR-LDP must be adapted to reach the new exit 
   point. The old path may be released and the new one setup, or the 
   mechanisms in [LSPMOD] might be used. 
    
2.4 Path & Resv refresh messages 
    
   RSVP Resv and Path messages are periodically resent to maintain soft 
   state, that is to confirm existing state. CR-LDP uses its own 
   mechanisms to keep alive CR-LSPs. Thus, at the arrival of a refresh 
   message, the Ingress LSR does not send any CR-LDP message into the 
   MPLS domain. 
    
2.5 Teardown messages 
    
   RSVP uses PathTear and ResvTear to remove RSVP state. Some of these 
   messages (e.g. PathTears to nodes which did not received any Resv) 
   does not release any sort of resource, others do.  
    
   This latter case only may cause the transmission of a CR-LDP Label 
   Release message. More detailed specification in the case of multiple 
   senders depends upon the reservation style and is given in the 
   following.  
    
2.6 Error messages 
    
   PathErr and ResvErr RSVP messages between the Ingress LSR and the 
   Egress LSR travel as regular IP traffic inside the MPLS domain.  
    
   Error messages do not remove any RSVP state. They trigger Teardown 
   messages responsible for the removal of state on upstream/downstream 
   RSVP nodes. That is, MPLS is not interested on error messages that 
   modify internal RSVP state.  
    
   By the RSVP point of view, CR-LDP error messages generated inside the 
   MPLS domain does not map into any RSVP error message. RSVP nodes 
   treat LSRs as a non RSVP-routers that are not expected to provide 
   QoS; whether additional QoS is reached inside the MPLS domain or not, 
   this is a matter local to the domain itself.

2.7 Classification 

   Soon after the CR-LSP has been established by the LSRs, the Ingress 
   LSR is ready to transmit into the MPLS domain the packets belonging 
   to the original IntServ flow. It is necessary to accurately specify 
   which packets may be mapped to the CR-LSP. Providing a FEC 
   specification for the CR-LSP does this. 
   Using the MPLS terminology, a FEC is a group of packets forwarded 
   over the same path and with the same forwarding treatment. The way a 
   FEC is determined depends upon the reservation style used by the Resv 
   message. 
    
2.7.1 Fixed-Filter Style 
    
   The Fixed-Filter (FF) reservation style uses the "Distinct" 
   reservation option, that is each single sender of the RSVP session 
   uses resources distinct from the other senders. To keep this 
   separation among senders' flows even in the MPLS domain, distinct CR-
   LSPs may be defined, each mapping one RSVP sender's traffic using a 
   different FEC.  

                       |                     |

                       | FEC=(HR,HS1)        | 
                       | ----------------->  |

                       | FEC=(HR,HS2)        | 
                       | ----------------->  |

       IntServ Area -->|<----MPLS domain---->|<-- IntServ Area 
    
   Figure 3 - FF reservation style 
    
   All the packets belonging to the same RSVP flow have five common 
   parameters in the IP/transport headers, that is IP Destination 
   address, IP Source address, Protocol, TCP/UDP Destination port, 
   TCP/UDP source port. Hence, the Ingress LSR checks these parameters 
   to determine the FEC and to choose the related CR-LSP. 
    
   When a Resv message incomes, the Ingress LSR takes from the SESSION

   each arriving packet to the FEC that matches these parameters. As a 
   consequence, a different FEC is created for each different sender. 
    
   If a Resv message that adds a FILTER_SPEC to the existing list 
   arrives to the Ingress LSR, a new Label Request message is sent to 
   setup the related CR-LSP. If an existing FILTER_SPEC is deleted the 
   related LSP must be deleted using a Label Release message. 
    
   A teardown message always deletes the CR-LSP associated with the 
   sender torn down. In the case that a PathTear arrives, one only 
   sender is removed that is specified by the SENDER_TEMPLATE object. 
   Thus the (eventually) allocated CR-LSP is released. In the case that 
   a ResvTear arrives, all CR-LSPs that match with the FILTER_SPECs 
   specified in the message are released. 
    
2.7.2 Shared-Explicit Style 
    
   The Shared-Explicit (SE) reservation style uses the "Shared" 
   reservation option, that is all the senders of the session share the 
   resources over the common hops of the path. This style uses also the 
   "Explicit" option, that is the Resv message contains in FILTER_SPEC 
   objects the identity of each sender that uses the resources.

   As in the FF style, each packet is classified matching the five 
   parameters in its headers with the information contained in the 
   SESSION and FILTER_SPEC objects. Differently by the FF style, the 
   Ingress LSR uses a single FEC (i.e. a single CR-LSP) for the traffic 
   generated by all the senders of the session identified by a 
   FILTER_SPEC object. 
    
   This way all these flows are merged inside the MPLS domain, which on 
   its turn treats these packets in a single manner.

   If a Resv message that modifies the FILTER_SPEC list arrives to the 
   Ingress LSR, this node updates the FEC associated to that RSVP 
   session. No modifications to the CR-LSP are then needed. 
    
   If the Ingress LSR receives a PathTear message, it modifies the FEC 
   (if one has been defined because of the arrival of a Resv message) 
   removing the sender specified by the SENDER_TEMPLATE object from the 
   list of senders. A ResvTear removes the senders listed by the 
   FILTER_SPECs objects from the list of the senders associated to the 
   FEC.  
    
   Both cases, if no more senders are available for that session, the 
   associated CR-LSP is released via a Label Release message. 
    
2.7.3 Wildcard-Filter Style 
    
   The Wildcard-Filter (WF) reservation style uses the "Shared" and the 
   "Wildcard" reservation options, that is all the traffic directed 
   towards the receiver of the session receives the same treatment in 
   the MPLS domain. No per-sender classification is then performed.

   Figure 5 - WF reservation style 
    
    
   A single FEC (i.e. a single CR-LSP) is then defined and used by all 
   the packets which match the three parameters IP destination address, 
   Protocol and Transport destination port contained in the SESSION 
   object. A Resv message using the WF style does not contain any 
   FILTER_SPEC object. 
    
    
   When an Ingress LSR receives a PathTear message, it releases the CR-
   LSP only if no more senders are available for that session. The 
   arrival of a ResvTear message always releases the CR-LSP.

2.7.4 Shared option and multiple Ingress LSRs 
    
   A modification of the mechanisms described in the paragraph 2.3 is 
   needed when hosts sends Path messages to the MPLS domain through 
   different Ingress LSRs but sharing some LSRs of the path.

   Figure 6 - Multiple Ingress LSRs topology 
    
   Looking at Figure 3, three hosts HS1, HS2 and HS3 send (at different 
   moments) a Path message each to the same session towards HR.  
    
   The Path originated by HS1 enter the MPLS domain through Ingress LSR1 
   while the Paths originated by HS2 and HS3 enters through Ingress 
   LSR2. The host HR sends a single Resv message towards the Egress LSR, 
   which is the common PHop  of the three senders. The Egress LSR sends 
   two Resv messages towards the two PHop of the session, one being 
   Ingress LSR1 for HS1, the other Ingress LSR2 for both HS2 and HS3. 
   Both Ingress LSR1 and Ingress LSR2 forward these messages upstream 
   inside the IntServ area. 
    
   The problem posed by this topology is that, following the rules given 
   in the previous paragraphs,  Ingress LSR1 and Ingress LSR2 will 
   create two different CR-LSPs for the same session inside the MPLS 
   domain, one for HS1 and the other for HS2 and HS3, each reserving the

   resources requested with the Resv message. This situation leads to a 
   waste of resources when the "Shared" reservation option (either the 
   SE or the WF style) is used. In all the shared links there is a 
   reservation of the resources twice than the needed amount. 
    
   To overcome this issue, we add a new CR-LDP "Shared TLV" object to 
   Label Request messages which signals to all the LSR along the path to 
   share reservation requests. 
    
   The Ingress LSR1 of the Figure 1 puts in the "Session" field of this 
   TLV the three fields of the RSVP SESSION object that identify the 
   receiver. The LSR inside the domain adds the value of this field to 
   the local state and forwards the Label Request message towards the 
   Egress LSR. Also the Ingress LSR2 sends its Label Request message to 
   LSR with a Shared TLV. LSR finds an identical Shared TLV (the one 
   from Ingress LSR1)in its state. Thus LSR does not forward the message 
   and directly sends a Label Mapping message to Ingress LSR2. From LSR 
   onward there is a single CR-LSP used by HS1, HS2 and HS3 which share 
   there common resources. LSR will assign the same outgoing label to 
   both the incoming labels identifying the traffic from Ingress LSR1 
   and Ingress LSR2. 
    
   All the Ingress LSRs should put this object in the Label Request 
   messages triggered by Resv messages using either WF or SE styles. The 
   Shared TLV must not be used together with the FF style, because each 
   flow needs different reservations. 
    
   We underline that the use of this object is optional because the only 
   side effect is a waste of resources. RSVP or CR-LDP message 
   processing is not affected.

   Forward unknown TLV bit. As defined in [LDP]. 
    
   Shared-TLV 
   This field indicates the type of the Shared TLV. Currently two types 
   are defined:  
    
        IPv4_RSVP_SESSION type: (Value TBA by IANA) 
    
        IPv6_RSVP_SESSION type: (Value TBA by IANA) 
    
   Length  
   Specifies the length of the Session field in byte. 
    
   Session 
   This field contains an ID of the session for which resources are 
   shared. The Session field is made up by three values taken from the 
   RSVP SESSION object: IP Destination address, Protocol, Transport 
   Destination port. 
    
   When IPv4_RSVP_SESSION TLV is specified, the IP Destination address 
   is an IPv4 (4 bytes) address; when IPv6_RSVP_SESSION TLV is 
   specified, the IP Destination address is an IPv6 one (16 bytes). 
    
3. Mapping between IntServ and CR-LDP services 
    
   This section defines translation mechanisms between IntServ traffic 
   parameters and CR-LDP ones. The target is to obtain a service inside 
   the MPLS domain which is as similar as possible to thate provided by 
   the IntServ areas. 
    
   The Ingress LSR receives the QoS parameters inside the FLOWSPEC 
   object of the Resv message. This LSR is responsible to translate 
   these IntServ values into a Traffic Parameters TLV that the Ingress 
   LSR will forward inside a Label Request message. 
    
   The Integrated Services WG has defined three services which specify 
   different packet treatments. The Null (N) service allows applications 
   to identify themselves to network QoS policy agents using RSVP 
   signaling. After this, packets are treated according to the DiffServ 
   architecture. Thus, this document does not support this kind of 
   service inside MPLS.  
    
   When performing a reservation request an application specify the 
   service's number and the values of the parameters it has chosen. CR-
   LDP uses peak rate, committed rate, and service granularity, to 
   describe traffic characteristic of a path.

   In the following paragraphs rules to create the Traffic parameters 
   TLV starting from the IntServ parameters are defined for each type of 
   service. 
    
3.1 Controlled Load service  
    
   The Controlled Load (CL) service provides the application with 
   service closely equivalent to that provided to best-effort traffic 
   under lightly loaded conditions. 
    
   A CL service request is characterized by five parameters (p, r, b, M, 
   m). An Ingress LSR sets CR-LDP traffic parameters using the following 
   rules: 
    
    
   PDR = p 
   PBS = M 
   CDR = r 
   CBS = b 
   EBS = 0 
    
   The PDR is equal to the peek rate (p) CL value. The PBS is equal to 
   the maximum packet size (M) because this way we control the maximum 
   size of the IP packets: packets larger then M bytes can never enter 
   this token bucket. The CDR is the average rate of the link and is 
   equal to the data rate (r) of the CL service. The CBS is defined as 
   the maximum size of a burst, hence it is equal to the bucket size 
   (b). The EBS value is set to 0 because this service has not an 
   equivalent parameter in the CL service. This does not prevent an 
   Ingress LSR to choose a value different from 0. 
    
3.2 Guaranteed service  
    
   Guaranteed (G) service provides firm bounds on end-to-end datagram 
   queueing delays.  The G service makes it possible to provide a 
   service that guarantees both delay and bandwidth.   
    
   A G service request is characterized by seven parameters (p, r, b, M, 
   m, R, S). An Ingress LSR sets CR-LDP traffic parameters using the 
   following rules: 
    
   PDR = p 
   PBS = M 
   CDR = R' 
   CBS = b

draft-tommasi-mpls-intserv-00.txt                           March 2001 

   EBS = 0 
    
   This mapping is very similar to the CL service one, the only 
   difference being that the CDR is set to R'.  
    
   R' may be equal to the Rate (R) parameter. To keep packets delay 
   below the bounds posed by the G service, the Ingress LSR (as all RSVP 
   routers) must set the CR-LDP data-rate higher than the traffic data 
   rate (r). According to [RFC2212], the R value guarantees that the 
   end-to-end delay for each packet is not larger than the requested 
   one. 
   R' may be smaller than R (but bigger than r) only if a non null slack 
   term is present. The R' value and the new slack term must be 
   calculated as the [RFC2212] specifies. 
    
3.3 Non-conformant packets 
    
   Non-conformant packets are those that do not conform traffic 
   specifications.  
    
   The Ingress LSR may treat these packets in different ways, at least 
   as in the followings: 
    
   1) Reducing the service to all packets 
   The Ingress LSR labels all the conforming and non conforming packets 
   with the label associated to the setup CR-LDP. LSRs internal to the 
   domain may be able to forward the traffic with a QoS similar to that 
   contracted or not. Each LSR may use its own rules to treat non-
   confoming packets. This means that the decision associated to the 
   treatment of non-conformant packets is shifted to internal LSRs.  
    
   2) Assigning a best-effort treatment 
   The Ingress LSR sorts the flow's packets into a conformant set and a 
   nonconformant set. Those in the conformant set are given the label of 
   the setup CR-LDP, those on the non-conformant are given the label of 
   the best-effort LSP which connects the Ingress LSR and the Egress 
   LSR. Internal LSRs are not aware of non-conforming traffic; they 
   simply serve them with the best-effort queue. As a side effect the 
   applications may receive packets greatly unordered. 
    
   3) Assigning a lower than best-effort treatment 
   Non-conforming and conforming packets should be sorted into two sets, 
   in this case too. Packets in the non-conforming set should be 
   assigned a deliver treatment with a priority lower than best-effort 
   one, not to congestion elastic applications. This option require the

   setup of a low priority path between the edge LSRs (and is not 
   convenient.) 
    
   4) Dropping them 
   The Ingress router drops all non-conforming packets. The most 
   important drawback of this solution is that applications that 
   requested to the network a service lighter than their traffic's 
   requirements will experience strong losses. 
    
   Each solution has pros and cons but there is not enough experience 
   with QoS to suggest an optimal choice; the best choice depends on the 
   characteristics of the domain. 
    
4. Caching and Aggregation techniques 
    
   This draft allows the setup of a CR-LDP inside the MPLS domain each 
   time an Ingress LSR receives a new RSVP Resv messages. A major issue 
   of the RSVP protocol is the overhead posed by messages' processing in 
   network routers that host a great number of RSVP sessions.  
    
   The MPLS domain (in the core of a network) is expected to serve a 
   great number of RSVP sessions. We want to avoid that this complexity 
   be imported in the MPLS domain. 
    
   RSVP's messages may be trigger or refresh ones. Refresh messages are 
   strictly related to the maintaining of the RSVP soft state. The 
   [ROREXT] draft redesign such refresh mechanism to mitigate its 
   effects. CR-LDP does not use soft state, that is its state needs not 
   to be periodically refreshed. Thus, the Ingress LSR does not send any 
   sort of refresh messages inside the domain. 
    
   The complexity imported from RSVP still resides in the number of CR-
   LDP messages sent into the domain: a CR-LDP message is sent each time 
   an RSVP trigger message setups or releases a reservation, according 
   to what specified in Section 2.  
    
   In the following paragraphs some techniques to reduce the number of 
   CR-LDP messages sent inside the domain are discussed. Though used to 
   reduce the message processing overhead, these mechanisms may be also 
   used when the protocol triggering the setup/release of CR-LSPs is not 
   RSVP. 
    
4.1 Caching of CR-LSPs 
    
   During the setup process, the Ingress LSR creates a CR-LSP and sends 
   into it all the packets that match the associated FEC. The

draft-tommasi-mpls-intserv-00.txt                           March 2001 

   classification of packets is performed by the Ingress LSR only; all 
   the LSR along the path schedule packets with the label associated to 
   that path. 
    
   Thus, when an RSVP teardown message incomes which releases a 
   reservation for a flow F1, the Ingress LSR may decide not to send the 
   Label Release message into the MPLS domain. It may wait for a given 
   "C" time for another reservation request, let say for the flow F2, 
   specifying the same Egress LSR and similar QoS. The Ingress LSR will 
   only change the FEC associated to the CR-LSP and assign the same 
   label to the packets belonging to this new RSVP flow. 
    
   The benefit given by such a mechanism is that instead of sending two 
   messages Label Request/Label Release for both F1 and F2, the Ingress 
   LSR will only send a Label Request for F1 and Label Release for F2. 
   This mechanism may be arbitrary generalized to N flows using, at 
   different times, that CR-LSP with no signaling excepted the original 
   Label request message. This mechanism looks very similar to a caching 
   strategy. 
    
   After an RSVP Teardown message has arrived, the Ingress LSR is 
   expected to set a timer of "C" seconds. If this timer expires and no 
   other flows are mapped to that CR-LSP in the meantime, the Ingress 
   LSR sends the Release message and removes the FEC. 
    
   As with all caching mechanisms, the one defined in this paragraph 
   strongly depends on the "C" caching time. In the case that this value 
   is a little one, the domain will not benefit of caching. On the other 
   side, if the C value is a big one, the resources associated to the 
   CR-LSP are held though not actually used by any traffic. 
   There is then a trade-off between the reduction of the signaling 
   conveyed by the Ingress LSR into the domain and the efficiency of the 
   usage of network resources. 
    
   After that the F2 flow has been transmitted through the CR-LSP 
   created for the F1 flow, the traffic related to F2 will use the QoS 
   setup per F1. F2 will receive inside the domain a service similar to 
   what expected only if its traffic parameters are similar to those of 
   F1.  Therefore, another parameter which affects the behaviour of the 
   cache is the affinity between the traffic characteristics associated 
   to the CR-LSP during the original setup, and the traffic parameters 
   of the flow wanting to use it. The affinity degree may be quantified 
   through an "A" parameter, which is a sort of "distance" between the 
   traffic parameters of F2 and the CR-LSP. As a second constraint, if 
   no degradation of QoS is desired, the CR-LSP traffic parameters must 
   not be less than those requested by F2.

   LSRs internal to the domain have no evidence of this mechanism. They 
   only experience a reduction of the CR-LDP signaling load and an over-
   subscription of resources. 
    
   CR-LSPs created using a Label Request message that specified a Shared 
   TLV must not be cached. In order to allow sharing of resources by 
   internal LSRs, such a CR-LSP has been mapped to a specific RSVP 
   session via the Shared TLV. Hence, it cannot by used by another RSVP 
   session. 
    
   Shared reservations cannot use then the CR-LSP cache, but this should 
   not impact the benefits of caching. Has been demonstrated that 
   scalability issues are posed by large numbers of one-to-one 
   audio/video conversations. Such sessions use the Distinct reservation 
   option (i.e. the FF style) and then may be cached. Anyway it is 
   possible, for shared reservations, not to use a Shared TLV inside the 
   Label request message. This way distinct paths are created by 
   different Ingress LSRs (see par. 2.7.4) and those CR-LSPs can be 
   cached after their usage. 
    
   Caching example: 
    
   R(i) means a reservation request for the Fi;  
   T(i) means a teardown request for the Fi. 
    
    
   R(1)                T(1)      R(2)           T(2)

   Figure 7 - Caching  
    
   In this example a CR-LSP is setup for a flow F1, with a Caching time, 
   using a Label Request message. 
   After the CR-LSP is setup, the flow F1 is released but no message is 
   sent into the domain. The Ingress LSR waits for a new flow F2 similar 
   to the CR-LSP, which arrives before that a timer of C seconds has 
   expired. After that also this flow is released, the Ingress LSR waits

   for another flow but after an idle time of C seconds, the LSR release 
   the CR-LSP from the domain. 
    
4.2 Aggregation of CR-LSPs 
    
   It has been discussed in the previous paragraph that the responsible 
   for the association of RSVP flows with a CR-LDP is the Ingress LSR. 
   Such a node may decide to map into a single CR-LDP more than one flow 
   directed towards the same Egress LSR. Having a smaller number of CR-
   LSPs, less CR-LDP signaling is needed. 
    
   Traffic parameters of this CR-LDP must satisfy the aggregated flows. 
   The Ingress LSR should sum the traffic specifications of each flow 
   and reserve a CR-LDP with the related Traffic Parameters (as 
   described in Section 3). The sum operation depends upon the service 
   being used, that is the aggregation can be only applied to flows 
   specifying the same service. A basic sum operation is defined in 
   [RFC2211] for the CL service or in [RFC2212] for the G one. The 
   Ingress LSR may decide to use more "aggressive" aggregation 
   algorithms than proposed in those basic specs, by defining an 
   aggregating sum which takes into account the statistical properties 
   of the flows. 
    
   Aggregation may be used in a straightforward way at the arrival of an 
   RSVP Bundle message from an Edge LSR. This message has been defined 
   in [ROREXT]; it is a container of other RSVP messages. All Resv 
   messages put in this Bundle come from the same Edge NHop (that is the 
   same Egress LSR). Some of these reservation requests may be satisfied 
   at once setting up a single aggregated CR-LSP. 
    
   Another possibility is given by the arrival of Resv which uses FF 
   style with more than one FILTER_SPEC (see Figure 3). Instead of 
   defining a CR-LSP for each FILTER_SPEC, an aggregated one might be 
   used. 
    
   In the most general case, at the incoming of a Resv message an 
   Ingress LSR may decide to setup a CR-LDP endowed with more resources 
   than needed. At different moments, the Ingress LSR may aggregate 
   other incoming flows to this CR-LDP, until this CR-LDP has available 
   resources. The degree of bandwith oversubscription is quantified 
   through a "B" parameter, which indicates how many flows with similar 
   traffic parameters can be accommodated into the aggregated CR-LSP. 
    
   To prevent a waste of resources as well as degradation of QoS, before 
   being mapped to an aggregated CR-LSP a flow must be similar to it, 
   that is with the proper affinity degree.

   Label Request                                        Label Release 
    
   Figure 8 - Aggregation 
    
   In this example we suppose that a CR-LSP is setup for a flow F1, with 
   a B parameter equal to 3, using a Label Request message. 
   After the CR-LSP is setup, the flow F2 and F3 request resources and 
   assigned to CR-LSP, if similar to it, with no signaling in the 
   domain. When F1 is removed, its "slot" is unallocated until the F4 
   flow is mapped to it. After F5 is removed no flows occupy the CR-LSP, 
   thus it is removed using a Label Release message. If caching is used, 
   this CR-LSP is kept for a C time before being released. 
    
4.3 The ABC control parameters 
    
   In the previous paragraphs we have defined three A, B, C parameters. 
   These parameters control all together the trade-off between the 
   reduction of CR-LDP signaling and the time resources are hold though 
   not used. 
    
   We now discuss the meaning of the ABC parameters without giving, as 
   far as of this version of the document, an exact definition. 
    
   In the examples contained in this paragraph we will suppose, for 
   simplicity sake, that a flow is characterized by a single parameter 
   "r" and the CR-LDP by the single CDR.

4.3.1 Parameter A 
    
   The A ("Affinity degree") parameter is the similarity degree between 
   two sets of traffic parameters. A flow can be assigned to an existing 
   CR-LSP only if similar to it. 
    
   Example:  
   A = 90% and the CDR = 100 kbps. CDR is the data rate associated to 
   the CR-LSP.  
    
   A flow F is similar to the CR-LSP only if its parameter r is less 
   than the CDR but not less than the 90% it. That is, F is similar only 
   if its r belongs to the [90kbps, 100kpbs] interval. 
    
4.3.2 Parameter B 
    
   The B ("Bandwidth multiplier") parameter is the bandwith multiplier 
   factor. When an incoming reservation request arrives, the Ingress LSR 
   setups a CR-LSP enabled to contain B distinct flows with similar  
   traffic parameters. 
    
   Example: 
   B=3 and the r = 50 kbps. The Ingress LSR will create a CR-LSP with a 
   CDR parameter equal to B*r, that is 150 kbps. 
    
   The reserving flow is mapped to this CR-LSP as well as future flows, 
   similar to the original r rate. At any time, that CR-LSP cannot 
   aggregate more than B flows.  
    
   If the A parameter is equal to 95%, a flow with a rate r equal to 48 
   kbps may be aggregated to that CR-LSP, another flow with rate equal 
   to 41 kbps (less than 47.5 kbps) cannot. 
    
4.3.3 Parameter C 
    
   The C ("Caching time") is the time a CR-LSP should be kept alive 
   after it is no longer used by any flow. This way the Ingress LSR 
   controls the await time for a new flow. 
    
   Example: 
   C= 10 min. The Ingress LSR, after having received a release request 
   from the outside of the domain, does not tear down the CR-LSP. If a 
   reservation request arrives from a flow in the following 10 minutes, 
   this flow uses that CR-LSP only if it is similar to it. Otherwise, 
   after 10 minutes expire, the Ingress LSR sends a Label Release 
   message along the path.

4.4 Examples of CR-LSP management strategies 
    
   The choice of the ABC parameters greatly affects the dynamic of the 
   management of the resources. The administrator of the network should 
   set these parameter for all the interfaces of the LSRs in the domain. 
   The values may change for each interface - someone may be connected 
   to a well-provisioned network, someone else not. In a following 
   version of this draft we will specify how the Ingress LSR collects 
   the ABC parameters along the path, and choose the values to assign to 
   a flow. 
   To simplify the administration work, a default configuration should 
   be given by the vendor which takes into account the features of the 
   product. However we recommend to provide "conservative" values as 
   defaults. 
    
   We now discuss how the configuration of the ABC parameters modify the 
   trade-off from a "conservative" (when less bandwidth is available) 
   towards an "aggressive" one (when a strong reduction of signaling is 
   desired). 
    
   The following are some of the possible scenarios. 
    
   o) One-to-one direct mapping: A=(any), B=1, C=0. 
         
        Neither caching nor aggregation are enabled, hence no affinity 
        value is needed. Each time a reservation request arrives, the 
        Ingress LSR setups the CR-LSP with traffic parameters given in 
        the FLOWSPEC of the message. When the related release request 
        arrives, the CR-LSP is immediately released inside the domain. 
        This scenario lead to a zero wasting of resources but with 
        complete signaling inside the  domain. This is the most 
        conservative strategy. 
         
   o) Isolated flows on cached paths: A=Low, B=1, C=High. 
         
        Caching only is enabled, with a loose affinity value. This way 
        CR-LSPs with large resources may be assigned to flows, that 
        continue to be isolated from each other.  
        The low affinity value grants a large usage of the cached paths. 
        This leads to some wasting of resources, but grants a minimum of 
        signaling in all the cases where reservation and deletion 
        requests incomes with a regular rate. 
         
   o) Aggregation of little flows: A=Low, B=High, C=0.

draft-tommasi-mpls-intserv-00.txt                           March 2001 

        Caching is disabled and aggregation heavily used. 
        This scenario is useful when a number of requests is expected 
        that reserve little resources each. This way, a path is defined 
        for many flows with a single signaling per aggregated path. 
    
   o) Multiplexing on fixed channels: A=Low, B=High, C=Infinite 
    
        A set of large (B is High) static channels (infinite caching 
        time) is created with traffic chosen traffic parameters. 
        Incoming traffic is very likely (because of the loose affinity) 
        aggregated to one of them. Otherwise, it will not receive QoS 
        inside the domain. This configuration needs no signaling inside 
        the domain, excepted from the initial one. 
    
    
Future Work 
    
   This version of the draft is far from being a complete document. 
   Future versions will: 
    
   o) Discuss the cases were either the RSVP NHop not coincide with the 
   Egress LSR or the RSVP PHop does not coincide with the Ingress LSR. 
    
   o) Collect information on the path using ADSPEC-like CR-LDP TLVs. 
    
   o) Contract information on ABC parameters along the path. 
    
   o) Allow the usage of MPLS tunnels. 
    
   o) Add processing rules for RSVP messages not considered in the 
   current version document. 
    
   o) Add detailed message processing rules. 
    
Security Considerations 
    
   No additional security issues are introduced in this draft. RSVP and 
   CR-LDP messages security problems are discussed in their 
   specification documents.
