AIRF = AIR*Nrm/PCR.

CLP=0 flow.

BN=1, the RM cells were generated by the destination or a switch.

CLP=0 cell on the connection is greater than or equal to the minimum:
RM-CER = RM-Cells with payload errors / Total RM-Cells Transmitted.

RM-CLR = Lost RM-Cells / Total RM-Cells Transmitted.

RM-CMR = Misinserted RM-Cells / Total RM-Cells Transmitted.
SECBR = Severely Errored Cell Blocks/Total Transmitted Cell Blocks
