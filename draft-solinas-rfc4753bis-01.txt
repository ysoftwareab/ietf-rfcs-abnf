INTERNET-DRAFT         ECP Groups for IKE and IKEv2            June 2009

Abstract

    This document describes three Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
    groups for use in the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) and Internet Key
    Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocols in addition to previously
    defined groups.  These groups are based on modular arithmetic rather
    than binary arithmetic.  These groups are defined to align IKE and
    IKEv2 with other ECC implementations and standards, particularly NIST
    standards.  In addition, the curves defined here can provide more
    efficient implementation than previously defined ECC groups.  This
    document obsoletes RFC 4753.

1.  Introduction

    This document describes default Diffie-Hellman groups for use in IKE
    and IKEv2 in addition to the Oakley groups included in [IKE] and the
    additional groups defined since [IANA-IKE].  This document assumes
    that the reader is familiar with the IKE protocol and the concept of
    Oakley Groups, as defined in RFC 2409 [IKE].

    RFC 2409 [IKE] defines five standard Oakley Groups: three modular
    exponentiation groups and two elliptic curve groups over GF[2^N].
    One modular exponentiation group (768 bits - Oakley Group 1) is
    mandatory for all implementations to support, while the other four
    are optional.  Nineteen additional groups subsequently have been
    defined and assigned values by IANA.  All of these additional groups
    are optional.

    The purpose of this document is to expand the options available to
    implementers of elliptic curve groups by adding three ECP groups
    (elliptic curve groups modulo a prime).  The reasons for adding such
    groups include the following.

INTERNET-DRAFT         ECP Groups for IKE and IKEv2            June 2009

    - The groups proposed afford efficiency advantages in software
      applications since the underlying arithmetic is integer arithmetic
      modulo a prime rather than binary field arithmetic.  (Additional
      computational advantages for these groups are presented in [GMN].)

    - The groups proposed encourage alignment with other elliptic curve
      standards.  The proposed groups are among those standardized by
      NIST, the Standards for Efficient Cryptography Group (SECG), ISO,
      and ANSI.  (See Section 5 for details.)

    - The groups proposed are capable of providing security consistent
      with the Advanced Encryption Standard [AES].

    In summary, due to the performance advantages of elliptic curve
    groups in IKE implementations and the need for further alignment with
    other standards, this document defines three elliptic curve groups
    based on modular arithmetic.

    These groups were originally proposed in [RFC4753].  This document
    changes the format of the shared key produced by a Diffie-Hellman
    exchange using these groups.  Section 9 provides more details of the
    changes from [RFC4753].  This document obsoletes RFC 4753.

2.  Requirements Terminology

    The keywords "MUST" and "SHOULD" that appear in this document are to
    be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Additional ECC Groups

    The notation adopted in RFC 2409 [IKE] is used below to describe the
    groups proposed.

3.1.  256-bit Random ECP Group

    IKE and IKEv2 implementations SHOULD support an ECP group with the
    following characteristics.  The curve is based on the integers modulo
    the generalized Mersenne prime p given by

                   p = 2^(256)-2^(224)+2^(192)+2^(96)-1

    The equation for the elliptic curve is:

                   y^2 = x^3 - 3 x + b

  256

Group Prime/Irreducible Polynomial:

4.  Security Considerations

    Since this document proposes groups for use within IKE and IKEv2,
    many of the security considerations contained within [IKE] and
    [IKEv2] apply here as well.

    The groups proposed in this document correspond to the symmetric key
    sizes 128 bits, 192 bits, and 256 bits.  This allows the IKE key
    exchange to offer security comparable with the AES algorithms [AES].

5.  Alignment with Other Standards

    The following table summarizes the appearance of these three elliptic
    curve groups in other standards.

    [ISO-15946-4].

6.  IANA Considerations

    IANA has updated its registries of Diffie-Hellman groups for IKE in
    [IANA-IKE] and for IKEv2 in [IANA-IKEv2] to include the groups
    defined above.

    In [IANA-IKE], the groups appear as entries in the list of
    Diffie-Hellman groups given by Group Description (attribute class 4).

Fu, Solinas                Expires May 18, 2010                 [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT         ECP Groups for IKE and IKEv2            June 2009

    The descriptions are "256-bit random ECP group", "384-bit random ECP
    group", and "521-bit random ECP group".  In each case, the group type
    (attribute class 5) has the value 2 (ECP, elliptic curve group over
    GF[P]).

    In [IANA-IKEv2], the groups appear as entries in the list of IKEv2
    transform type values for Transform Type 4 (Diffie-Hellman groups).

    Upon adoption of this document as an RFC, these entries in both
    [IANA-IKE] and [IANA-IKEv2] should be updated.  The update should
    consist of changing the reference from [RFC4753] to this document.

7.  ECP Key Exchange Data Formats

    In an ECP key exchange, the Diffie-Hellman public value passed in a
    KE payload consists of two components, x and y, corresponding to the
    coordinates of an elliptic curve point.  Each component MUST have bit
    length as given in the following table.

       Diffie-Hellman group                component bit length
       ------------------------            --------------------

       256-bit Random ECP Group                   256
       384-bit Random ECP Group                   384
       521-bit Random ECP Group                   528

    This length is enforced, if necessary, by prepending the value with
    zeros.

    The Diffie-Hellman public value is obtained by concatenating the x
    and y values.

    The Diffie-Hellman shared secret value consists of the x value of the
    Diffie-Hellman common value.

    These formats should be regarded as specific to ECP curves and may
    not be applicable to EC2N curves.

8.  Test Vectors

    The following are examples of the IKEv2 key exchange payload for each
    of the three groups specified in this document.

    We denote by g^n the scalar multiple of the point g by the integer n;
    it is another point on the curve.  In the literature, the scalar
    multiple is typically denoted ng; the notation g^n is used in order
    to conform to the notation used in [IKE] and [IKEv2].

8.1.  256-bit Random ECP Group

    IANA assigned the ID value 19 to this Diffie-Hellman group.

9.  Changes from RFC 4753

    Section 7 (ECP Key Exchange Data Formats) of [RFC4753] states that

	   The Diffie-Hellman public value is obtained by concatenating
            the x and y values.

            The format of the Diffie-Hellman shared secret value is the
            same as that of the Diffie-Hellman public value.

    This document replaces the second of these two paragraphs with the
    following:

            The Diffie-Hellman shared secret value consists of the x
            value of the Diffie-Hellman common value.

    This change aligns the ECP key exchange format with that used in
    other standards.

    This change appeared earlier as an erratum to RFC 4753.  This
    document obsoletes that erratum.

    Section 8 (Test Vectors) of [RFC4753] provides three examples of
    Diffie-Hellman key agreement using the ECP groups.  This document

    changes the last paragraph of each subsection of Section 8 to
    reflect the new format.
